Varadkar said it should be up to Sinn Fein leader Mary Lou McDonald (centre) to try and form a government, but warned she had made \u0027a lot of promises\u0027 that now have to be delivered on\u0027I relish the opportunity to do that,\u0027 he said.While all coalition talks are taking place behind closed doors, Ms McDonald said previously that her aim would be to form a left-wing coalition without Fine Gael or Fianna Fail - the party which pipped them to win the most seats.Sinn Fein would need to secure the support of the Greens, Labour, the Social Democrats and SolidarityPeople Before Profit, and a range of independent TDs, to form such an administration. If that proves impossible, then government alongside Fianna Fail may prove the only workable alternative.Asked of the prospect of a \u0027super coalition\u0027 of Fine Gael, Fianna Fail and potentially the Greens, Mr Varadkar said he hadn\u0027t taken part in any such talks.But he said he would be willing to talk with rival political leaders if there was a need to \u0027give the country political stability\u0027. After meeting with Green Party leader Eamon Ryan, Ms McDonald described the exchanges as \u0027useful and constructive\u0027.\u0027I have made it clear since before the election - and after - that I will speak to all parties in the interests of forming a government starting with those with a mandate for change,\u0027 she said.\u0027The Green Party, having increased its mandate significantly, is undoubtedly one of those parties.\u0027         McDonald is trying to form a left-wing coalition of smaller parties, including the Greens (leader Eamon Ryan pictured)If Ms McDonald does not reach 80 seats, she could theoretically form a minority government.However, that would require an understanding with either Fianna Fail or Fine Gael, through some form of confidence and supply arrangement, that would see them abstain on key votes from the opposition benches.SolidarityPeople Before Profit TD Richard Boyd Barrett said a minority Sinn Fein-led Irish government may not last long but it could still achieve progress on key domestic issues.\u0027It wouldn\u0027t be sustainable for very long but I still think it\u0027s worth exploring if we could do something to urgently address the housing crisis, some of the problems in the health service with the desperate waiting lists, some of the issues around climate change and the cost of living,\u0027 he told RTE Radio One.\u0027I think anything that could give expression and delivery to the sentiment that people expressed at the ballot box during the election would be worth exploring and I am absolutely keen to do it and People Before Profit are absolutely keen to try to do that.\u0027Many believe it will be impossible to form a government without the involvement of one of either Fianna Fail or Fine Gael, the two long-time big beasts of Irish politics.A coalition of Fianna Fail, Sinn Fein and the Green Party - which ended with 12 seats - is seen as a potentially more realistic option. Though that would involved Fianna Fail leader Micheal Martin u-turning on his pledge never to do business with Sinn Fein.Another permutation could see the exclusion of Sinn Fein, with Fine Gael and Fianna Fail entering power together with another smaller party or grouping - a so-called \u0027super coalition\u0027.Fianna Fail could also potentially seek to form a minority government with several of the smaller parties - an administration that would require a confidence and supply deal with Fine Gael on the opposition benches.That would reverse the landmark pact struck in 2016 that saw Fianna Fail, as the main opposition party, sustain the last Fine Gael-led minority government in power.With so much uncertainty about the make-up of the next government, another general election cannot be ruled out.         Varadkar said that he has not been approached about forming a \u0027super coalition\u0027 between his Fine Gael party and rivals Fianna Fail, but refused to rule it out if Sinn Fein cannot form a majority (election posters pictured in Dublin)Fianna Fail emerged from Saturday\u0027s election as the largest party by the narrowest margin over the surging Sinn Fein.Mr Martin\u0027s party finished with 38 seats to Sinn Fein\u0027s 37 at the end of two days of counting.But given the Fianna Fail speaker was re-elected without contest, both parties essentially \u0027won\u0027 the same number of seats.Fine Gael was the big loser, winning only 35 seats having entered the campaign as the largest party on 47.Despite being edged in seat numbers, Sinn Fein was undoubtedly the party with most to celebrate, having smashed Ireland\u0027s long-standing two-party system.Ms McDonald\u0027s party triumphed in the popular vote and may have won many more seats - potentially an additional 11 - if it had fielded more candidates in the landmark contest.As such, momentum is behind her in taking the first steps in what could be a long and tortuous process to form a new government.She has predicted she could be Ireland\u0027s next taoiseach. "},{"url":null,"title":"Eighteen month old girl left horror burns thigh","story":"Share this article          The couple (pictured above) put the photos out on Facebook in order to thank the other passengers that helped them Paraplanner Joe alleged: \u0027An air hostess carelessly spilled tea down Lily\u0027s leg and consequently has left her with a nasty burn on her thigh.\u0027We have been going through the complaints process with TUI since we landed and upon reading the flight log, finally this week, the flight attendant\u0027s version of events is a complete lie and they\u0027re trying to cover up their c**k up.\u0027Me and Hollie both wish we acted a bit more cerebral and got the names of the fellow passengers who helped, however we were too busy tending to Lily and didn\u0027t have our minds on anything but her wellbeing.\u0027We are hoping that this post will reach the said passengers and if it does, first of all, thank you for helping our girl.

Instead, it’s a sedate trudge through giant canvases – giving you the bottle but not the booze, the facts but not the feelingI would love to meet Vincent van Gogh. I would shake his hand – a gesture we know meant a lot to him because he sometimes signed letters “with a handshake”. And I’d tell him: “Vincent, you are loved.”As it happens, Bill Nighy beat me to it, playing a critic in the 2010 Doctor Who episode Vincent and the Doctor. Tony Curran, who starred as Vincent in that instalment, is on screen at the end of the Meet Vincent Van Gogh Experience, along with the late Kirk Douglas, who portrayed the artist in Lust for Life. Their presence reminds you that Van Gogh has become a bit like Hamlet: an epic challenge for actors, with a last act to make anyone weep.The exhibition chooses to start at that awful ending. We’re in a field in France under low, grey-blue rain clouds. Black triangles of crows sweep across the steel sky in an animation drawn from one of his last canvases, Wheatfield With Crows, from 1890. Van Gogh speaks, describing his final loss of hope. A shot rings out.His life flashes before him, and we walk through his memories, seeing the starry night, the little bedroom and other images burned on the dying artist’s consciousness. Anyway, that seems to be the conceit. The reality is nothing so immersive. It’s all quite sedate. You stand in a room surrounded by the wheat field on screen, with the soundtrack on a headset, then walk gently into the next space, where cafe tables recreate a bohemian hangout in 1880s Paris. My table had a skull, a bottle and an absinthe spoon – but they were all fastened down. That says it all for this experience – you get the bottle but not the booze, the facts but not much of the feeling.What would an actually immersive Van Gogh experience be like? A rollercoaster ride of emotional highs and lows, a vertigo-inducing Starry Night big wheel, a drop into the abyss, an absinthe trip with the Green Fairy. It would have to pull you into the vortex of his despair, raise you to his perceptions of nature’s glory. Instead, this show has the laid-back feel of a spiegeltent serving slightly flat beer. There should be a standup telling Vincent jokes.It is, in fact, housed in a giant tent. Queuing for a ticket and renting an obligatory locker, it’s hard to resist the feeling you are about to change into ice skates. A Van Gogh ice rink might even work – after all, the Dutch have long loved ice skating, to judge from old pictures. The stars and irises could whirl around as you glided.As it is, we trudge like potato eaters into a space lit by the golden yellows he found when he first travelled to Arles, Provence, in February 1888. There’s a haystack to sit on while you watch slides of some of his incandescent southern scenes and hear him read aloud letters to his brother Theo about his rhapsodic state. The Yellow House, his painting of the artists’ community he created, is transformed into a glowing cottage-sized structure – the most impressive technological coup here. But inside it the agonising decay of his friendship with Paul Gauguin – the only artist he lured to his dream studio – is drably dramatised as a low-energy shadow play.Vincent’s exuberant presence is lacking throughout this low-key son et lumière. Where’s the virtual reality Vincent we’ve been waiting for, resurrected to rant about the painter’s mission? Or the animatronic Vincent, painting furiously in the fields?The real place to meet Van Gogh, of course, is in his paintings. Every laden brushstroke is a piece of his soul. There are beautifully precise enlargements of details that show just how fraught with passion those ridges of orange, blue and black really are. These magnified brush marks make you see how Van Gogh helped invent abstract art. But the framed replicas that hang throughout the event look rubbery.This exhibition is not a true experience of Van Gogh, but a simplified guide to the outline of his life that left me hungry enough to eat paint. Instead, I made a pilgrimage across the Thames to stand in front of his Sunflowers at the National Gallery. Now there’s a true meeting with his soul. I hope he feels the love."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9fbb0407512ccd34456fa8cd9362e4f97e7c640a/195_3_1396_838/master/1396.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=beed3fa2cd1f0ab47bd490691db838ec","title":"bp sets net zero carbon target for 2050","story":"New CEO Bernard Looney reveals plan to invest more in low-carbon businessesBP is following the lead of other large oil firms by setting a target to reduce its contribution to the climate crisis by removing more than 400m tonnes of carbon emissions a year.Bernard Looney, who replaced Bob Dudley as chief executive this month, said BP would aim to become a net zero company by 2050 or sooner by tackling “all the carbon we get out of the ground as well as all the greenhouse gases we emit from our operations”.Looney will reveal in September how the group will meet the ambitious targets, and he said he expects BP will “invest more in low-carbon businesses – and less in oil and gas – over time”.The strategy is likely to include reducing emissions from BP operations and using carbon offsetting measures such as tree-planting. “It is clear to me and to our stakeholders that for BP to play our part and serve our purpose we have to change. And we want to change – this is the right thing for the world and for BP,” Looney said.BP’s green goals have ided environmental campaigners. Some welcomed the company’s ambition others criticised the absence of a clear strategy.Murray Worthy, a senior campaigner at Global Witness, said BP’s net zero pledge “looks like an attempt to grab some positive headlines by a new CEO but with little of substance to show how it will achieve these grand claims.“There is nothing ambitious about a plan that is simply not credible. Saying that they will invest more in low-carbon tech and less in oil and gas ‘over time’ is not a credible plan for reaching net zero. The science is clear that this shift has to happen immediately.”The ambitions were welcomed by Climate Action 100+, the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change (IIGCC) and the Church of England Commissioners, which have all collaborated with BP’s executives to help tackle the climate crisis.Stephanie Pfeifer, a member of Climate Action 100+ and the chief executive of the IIGCC, said investors would continue to look for progress from BP including how it would invest more in non-oil and gas businesses and ensure its lobbying activity supports delivery of the Paris agreement.Looney told investors the company plans to keep growing its cashflows and shareholder distributions over the long term, raising concerns over whether it will reduce the amount of oil and gas that it produces.An investigation by the  last year revealed that the company planned to grow its production of oil and gas by about a fifth between 2018 and 2030, despite warnings that an increase in fossil fuel production would put the world on track for catastrophic global heating and a runaway climate crisis.Looney said: “We all want energy that is reliable and affordable but that is no longer enough. It must also be cleaner. To deliver that, trillions of dollars will need to be invested in replumbing and rewiring the world’s energy system.“It will require nothing short of reimagining energy as we know it. This will certainly be a challenge but also a tremendous opportunity.” BP said it aimed to play a more active role in lobbying for policies that would spur climate action, and cut its spending on corporate reputational sponsorship and redirect the funds towards promoting climate action.The company has faced growing public protests over its sponsorship of the arts in recent months. This month the  became the first major global news organisation to ban advertising from fossil fuel companies.Looney set out the plans for a greener BP alongside an overhaul of the company, under a new leadership team. The shakeup will involve four new business areas: production and operations, customers and products, gas and low-carbon energy, and innovation and engineering.Helge Lund, the chairman, said: “The board supports Bernard and his new leadership team’s ambition for BP. Aiming for net zero is not only the right thing for BP, it is the right thing for our shareholders and for society more broadly.“As we embark on this ambitious agenda, we will maintain a strong focus on safe, reliable and efficient operations and on delivering the promises we have made to our investors.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fa95f7e1ddbdeee86c08fe0fea8a9ee48e872ba2/0_493_6496_3898/master/6496.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d16d6e68da4c81e8f90b420df4feaab3","title":"damien hirst medicine cabinet auction","story":"Artist pays tribute to collector Robert Tibbles, who was his first customer in 1989In 1989, 28-year-old Robert Tibbles bought a medicine cabinet artwork full of bottles of pills for £600. His friends derided it as “crap” and told Tibbles he had been ripped off and should return it.On Thursday that medicine cabinet, called Bodies by Damien Hirst, is expected to sell for between £1.2m and £1.8m in an auction of Tibbles’ entire Cool Britannia collection, which also includes works by Michael Craig-Martin and Gilbert \u0026amp George.“I always thought the medicine was a very clever piece, and it really resonated with me,” Tibbles said. “I can’t explain why I had to buy it, but I did. For a long time people were really quite rude about it, essentially they were saying ‘what is that doing in your drawing room?”.Then a young City trader, he bought the cabinet shortly after it was shown in Hirst’s degree show at Goldsmiths, making Tibbles the artist’s first customer alongside Charles Saatchi, who bought two of the original four cabinets.Hirst described Tibbles as a “lovely man”, whom he thanks every day for helping him get started in the art market.“I remember Robert very well, he was so excited by the art,” the artist said. “It was in the days when I installed my own work in people’s houses, so I went round and met him and he made me tea,” Hirst said.“Robert is a proper collector and I’m really touched he kept and lived with my work for all those years.”“He believed in me when no one did,” Hirst said in an Instagram post. “Not many people bought my work in those days and the ones that did sold it pretty quickly … The medicine cabinet is one of the first 12 I made in 1989.“It was before I had assistants and so I made it myself in my kitchen, buying all the bits from B\u0026ampQ, and I collected the medicine bottles and boxes from my local hospital in Greenwich.”Tibbles, who started buying Hirst’s work with his annual bonuses from the US investment bank PaineWebber and later the Swiss bank UBS, said he shed “a few tears” when he read Hirst’s Instagram post.As well as Bodies, Tibbles also bought an early Hirst spot painting, Antipyrylazo III (1994), which is also up for auction. It carries a guide price of £900,000-£1.2m and is Tibbles’ personal favourite.There is also a butterfly painting called Summer Breeze and a spin artwork – a “beautiful tropical, jungle painting” – both of which are expected to fetch more than £250,000.Tibbles’ collection of 30 works had been hung in his flat in Earl’s Court, south-west London, which he bought in 1994 to house the collection, because it has large rooms and high ceilings.The collection is expected to fetch at least £4m when it goes under the hammer at Phillips in Mayfair this week.Tibbles said hoped to spend some of the proceeds on buying work by young and up-and-coming artists."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/684f7b905f9553f64a9791ab9953dee7a8befdec/31_69_1476_885/master/1476.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7b7730360d781c364beb3e1c353cbec6","title":"inquiry government funding norton motorcycles","story":"Officials accused of ‘blindly pouring’ taxpayers’ money into firm before it went bustThe chair of parliament’s public accounts committee is calling for an investigation into the government’s funding of Norton Motorcycles and has accused officials of “blindly pouring” millions of pounds of taxpayers’ money into the motorbike firm before it went bust.Meg Hillier MP is to write to the department for business, energy and industrial strategy (BEIS), as well as the Cabinet Office, to ask for an inquiry into the events leading up to the failure of the Leicestershire-based manufacturing company last month.After the collapse, a  and ITV News investigation revealed that 228 “ordinary working people” had had their entire pension pots, worth £14m, invested in Norton shares after being duped by a fraudster.The motorcycle firm had also been funded via a £1m loan received directly from a separate fraud, as well as about £5m of government grants.Aside from the millions in taxpayer support given to Norton, the business also benefited from a string of then government ministers showering the firm with glowing endorsements or agreeing to photo opportunities with the Norton boss Stuart Garner, including the prime minister Theresa May, the chancellor George Osborne, the business secretary Vince Cable and the trade secretary Liam Fox.“It reads a bit here of Whitehall not doing its due diligence and, perhaps, not challenging ministers enough when they said this is a good company.”The comments came as a report, prepared by Norton’s administrators BDO for prospective buyers of the business, began to shed light on some of the more curious-looking decisions that appear to have been taken by the firm.The document outlines how Norton owns a fleet of luxury vehicles, including six Aston Martins, three Range Rovers and an F Type Jaguar. According to the accountants, the car collection is worth close to £800,000.The report also uses numbers from the company’s last set of published financial results, covering the year to March 2018, that showed that chief executive Garner personally owed the firm £160,000, while a £324,002 loan given by Norton to one of Garner’s other companies had been “deemed irrecoverable” and was “written off in the year”.Questions had been raised within the the motorcycle industry about the viability of Norton for years. Even so, a series of business and finance ministers seized on the chance of associating themselves with a glamorous product and a historic UK manufacturing brand.In July 2015, the then chancellor, Osborne, said his government’s long-term economic plan was “all about backing successful British brands like Norton”, as he visited the firm’s Leicestershire factory to announce a £4m grant from BEIS to Norton and 11 of its supply chain partners.Of the £4m, £1.8m was awarded directly to Norton, with a further £968,123 going to the British Motorcycle Manufacturing Academy, a charitable business controlled by Garner, according to a response to a freedom of information request submitted by the  and ITV News.The Osborne grant was followed a year later by a £2.1m grant to Norton from Innovate UK, which also falls under the domain of BEIS.Further examples of government support include Cable, the then business secretary, announcing a £625,000 government-backed loan by Santander in 2011. Cable said he hoped “that many more companies are inspired by what Norton is going to achieve through this funding”. It is understood that the taxpayer no longer has any exposure to this loan.Even as the company was unravelling, nobody in government appeared to want to apply the brakes. Only 13 months ago, Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, visited the factory and described Norton as a “great business, great brand”.Then – in November 2019 with Norton in its death throes – the Midlands Engine Investment Fund, part of the British Business Bank that also falls under the auspices of BEIS, signed a heads of terms agreement to provide a £1.5m “growth loan”.The loan was never provided. It is understood that Norton did not submit the required paperwork before crashing into administration last month.Garner has previously denied any wrongdoing, saying he was unaware that he was dealing with fraudsters and that he counts himself as one of the victims of the pension scam. He declined requests for comment on the luxury cars and the loans from Norton.He is due to appear in front of the pensions ombudsman on Thursday, which is hearing a case brought by 30 complainants regarding Garner’s conduct in relation to the pension schemes.BEIS had failed to respond to requests for comment at the time of publication."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f9f338069edf8aff834920952b9ba85b7d5b83a2/0_129_3840_2305/master/3840.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=50026a85059c0968f2ce7b9a9007282e","title":"british empire lisa nandy history","story":"If I had learned about the British empire at school, I would find it easier to follow the news.

I could have better understood events as erse as Sinn Féin’s election success in Ireland, the rise and fall of Hindu nationalism in India, and the British government’s casual attitude to deporting black British people to Jamaica, all of which have their roots in Britain’s imperial history.For to fully comprehend such deportations one needs an understanding of how black people came to be in Jamaica in the first place, (clue: it doesn’t involve everyone’s favourite abolitionist, William Wilberforce) and how Jamaicans were later encouraged to move to Britain and become part of it. Our education system may deem such information irrelevant, yet it is always in the news. Lisa Nandy’s pledge to remove the word empire from the honours system was but the latest example. The Labour leadership candidate said that she wants the E in OBE to become “excellence”, in recognition of the fact that the empire left, for many people, a painful legacy.That prompted the usual claim that British people – authentic, patriotic British people – would be damaged by such information. Certain commentators claim that working-class people find the prospect of discussing our recent history “anti-British”. Leaving aside the paradox that so many of those complaining about Nandy’s idea are fanatical advocates of free speech yet recoil when people speak freely about the history of empire, I’m struck by how patronising it is to suggest that working-class people (and I presume that what is meant is white working-class people, because many black working-class people have firsthand knowledge of the empire) having been born in it don’t want to know about Britain. What should be a discussion of how we can thrive as a modern nation by understanding our past has descended into a phoney culture war fought over what is in reality supremely complex historical ground.It is complex because there was not one British empire but many and I’m curious to continue where my education left off. For my new podcast series, I wanted to know what it was like to be born in Hong Kong, as was Emma-Lee Moss, the half-Chinese, half-British singer who grew up in the colony and then witnessed its handover to China. Then there is South Carolina, to which the British trafficking of enslaved people from what is now Sierra Leone transferred rice-farming technology, as well as the linguistic, cultural and ethnic community of those such as the historian Joseph Opala. His Gullah people retain a distinctive identity to this day.I wanted to understand how colonialism worked in Jamaica, where a young woman was recruited as a nurse in the newly created NHS as part of the Windrush generation, and would go on to defend Britain enslaving her ancestors to her British-born son: “Oh, black people, you know – we sinned against God. And as a punishment we went into slavery.” Her grandson has a view of empire that is radically different. Benjamin Zephaniah, who refused an honour that he felt glorified the system that enslaved his ancestors, told me about the ways in which his mother had internalised imperial ideology. Many of us have.We tend to believe the empire is a black and brown story. It is not. The actor Diana Rigg – famous either as Lady Olenna Tyrell from Game of Thrones or as Emma Peel from The Avengers, depending on your age – also spoke of having never forgotten her mother’s shock at finding herself, a working-class girl from Doncaster, sitting with a basket laden with fruits at a maharaja’s palace. One of the lesser crimes of the empire is that white families such as the Riggs found themselves in some of the culinary hotspots of the world yet felt compelled by social norms and ideas of racial superiority to live on tins of Spam.Coronavirus dominates the news, but how many people know that the globalisation of modern pandemics began with the co-opting of huge swaths of the planet into European empires? This isn’t something to celebrate, but that does not mean it is something to ignore. It shouldn’t be that difficult – for, whether we know it or not, we all have a story of empire to tell.• Afua Hirsch’s new Audible series We Need to Talk about the British Empire is out on Thursday"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0802a7230320adc9b7fc9e941e66ff4fcd06efc3/0_119_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=48b83641a4ce1ebcd4f48ac4caddb490","title":"labour councils radicy austerity government policy voters","story":"Across the country their reputation is rotten. But it wasn’t always this way – councils’ radical past should point the way forwardNear where I live is a corner of regularly updated graffiti about the activities of my local authority, the London borough of Southwark. The writing is always connected to the council’s deals with the property developers Lendlease and Delancey, which have included demolishing a large council estate to build several skyscraping “luxury flats”, and more recently attempting to pull down a 1960s shopping centre that has become a hub for the local Latin American community.The graffiti is usually rubbed out quickly, so you have to move fast to document it for a few days, it referred to a Labour councillor involved in selling off a 25-acre council estate that was home to more than 1,000 low-income tenants as a “toenail” (since the estate was redeveloped, many of the new apartments have been sold to foreign investors). Labour leadership candidates have extolled the importance of local councils. For Keir Starmer, local government is the “frontline of Labour politics” – and councillors are often the first “to identify new solutions”. Listening to Lisa Nandy, one might assume that Labour councils were held in high esteem – so much so that their voices should be made permanent in the party’s NEC.Hearing candidates speak about the importance of local government, I thought of that graffiti. I also thought of the abundant reports from towns in the Midlands and the north that have been run with barely any interruption by the Labour party since the 1930s. Former Labour voters polled for the recent Ashcroft report said that Labour councils were “run down” and “shocking”, and that Labour councillors “stab you in the back”. I’m reliably informed that in Bolton, the 2017 Tory campaign centred locally on the slogan “Labour have ruined Bolton, don’t let them ruin Britain”. To campaigners on the ground during the 2019 election, it was clear that councils were rivalled in their unpopularity only by Jeremy Corbyn.This is the desired result of decades of Conservative policy. Until the 1980s, Labour councils were the testing ground for the party’s policies in government. Mass council housing, the NHS and much of the welfare state were first trialled in places as erse as the London County Council and the pit villages of County Durham. Radical socialist ideas about democratic planning, international solidarity and multiculturalism came from insurgent councils such as Poplar in the 1920s, Clay Cross in the 1970s and the Greater London Council (GLC) in the 1980s, respectively. Confrontations with central government were often dangerous for those involved. When Poplar’s council defied central government’s tax collection in 1921 to raise revenues for local poor relief, 29 councillors were sentenced to imprisonment. In Clay Cross, when the council rebelled against a 1972 government act that would increase council rent, 21 councillors were banned from office. And when Ken Livingstone’s socialist policies put the GLC in the firing line of Margaret Thatcher’s government, it was abolished.During the postwar period, councils were run as local, social democratic states. For a brief period in the 1980s, the GLC showed that local government could be a fertile test bed for radical experiments in socialist democracy. Both prospects were equally threatening to the Conservative government of the 1980s. Thatcher’s introduction of “rate-capping”, which curtailed the tax-raising powers of local housing, made experiments in municipal socialism almost impossible. The introduction of right to buy, a hallmark Thatcherite policy, shrunk the availability of council housing and put an end to the dream that local authorities could provide shelter and security for all their constituents. Under the influence of American new public management theories, local councils were disciplined to act more like businesses, and the public sector started to believe that it couldn’t do anything properly – which, unsurprisingly, became a self-fulfilling prophecy.Although New Labour briefly turned the funding taps back on in the 2000s, allowing local councils to borrow money more freely, these reforms came with strings attached: public finance initiatives, league tables and outsourcing. Since 2010, council spending on local services has plummeted. Almost a decade of Conservative austerity has drastically cut council budgets and hollowed out local services. According to a 2019 analysis by the TUC, councils in England are spending £7.8bn less on key services than they did in 2010 of the 20 councils with the largest funding gaps, 18 are controlled by Labour.There have been some ingenious responses to these straitened circumstances from certain quarters. The formation of a municipal building company in Norwich to get around the deliberately harsh rules on council building is one example. Elsewhere, councils such as Preston have defied a familiar story of dependency on outsourcing and outside investment. Perhaps not coincidentally, the town was a notable exception to Labour’s appalling general election results in the non-metropolitan north west. Even Nandy’s proposal to ert funding from local enterprise board quangos to councils would be a move towards greater local democracy. But she will likely recognise that councils have become a redoubt for the Labour right, a conservative force resistant to change or new ideas.Today, councils with radical agendas face extreme challenges. Though the “Preston model” has much to teach depressed northern and Midlands towns, London councils instead face an enormous resource curse, with local authorities subsidising new council housing by building towers for millionaires. Even supposedly leftwing councils such as Momentum-controlled Haringey are funding themselves by selling off land to a giant developer.But there are signs of hope. Liverpool’s mayor, Joe Anderson, has already said the city will refuse to implement any more cuts. Faced with a crisis in social care and homelessness, it seems likely that a new generation of Labour councillors may start to repeat the slogan of the Poplar councillors in the 1920s: “better to break the law than to break the poor”. Will the party leadership be supporting them?• Owen Hatherley is an author and culture editor of Tribune"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/40ce3b3569053c62100adbd4c94940ff29736329/0_161_4856_2915/master/4856.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4a495f56143970b216fbfb8d2ab393cc","title":"minorities labour defeat woke issues","story":"Abandoning so-called ‘woke’ issues would hand the right victory in its culture warIt’s the woke what lost it. Corbynism’s Waterloo can be explained as a long-deserved revolt against the tyranny of a censorious, oh-so-superior progressive left, which hounded anyone who dared question its elitist social norms. Alienated by the assault on their sacred traditional values by the metropolitan-quinoa-Taliban, Labour’s working-class base tore the red wall down.Here, at least, is a narrative that has emerged since the party’s devastating rout, most recently aired in a report by Tory pollster Lord Ashcroft. The party “had come to embody an excessively politically correct or ‘woke’ culture,” the report deduces from focus groups, with objections including the claim “You’re a bigot if you don’t agree there are 125 different genders”, and disapproval at Jeremy Corbyn for declaring his pronouns.In truth, this story of a supposedly central conflict between “ordinary” Britons and social progressives is nothing new. The idea of a “white working class” – defined by whiteness and social values rather than by an economic relationship – came into vogue in the late 2000s, with the Daily  describing them as “Britain’s betrayed tribe”, claiming they’d been “pushed to the margins by the politicians” for whom they had voted for generations because of New Labour’s “isive and wasteful” promotion of multiculturalism. Today, siren voices demand that Labour learn from its defeat by throwing off the “yoke of the woke”. The Tories indeed intend to pour accelerant on the so-called “culture war” – a euphemism for stoking resentment at minorities and their struggles for equality. This was evidenced by their contrived fury at the court of appeal blocking the deportation of people who came here as children over convictions including drug offences. Yet Labour’s historic mission – however inconsistent it has sometimes been – needs restating: to advance the interests of working people and to combat oppression against women and minorities. That was always based on the recognition that the working class on the one hand and women and minorities on the other were not separate categories, but impossible to disentangle. That’s why Clement Attlee was a founding member of the Homosexual Law Reform Society, and why under Labour’s watch laws partially decriminalised homosexuality, legalised abortion, forbade discrimination against women and minorities, and finally repealed all anti-gay laws.As such, Labour has always been pilloried for championing minorities and women. In the 1980s, Labour councils were described by the press as the “loony left” for advocating for LGBTQ rights. In 1987, Neil Kinnock’s then press officer, Patricia Hewitt, wrote a letter warning that “the ‘loony Labour left’ is taking its toll: the gay and lesbians issue is costing us dear among the pensioners”. It is indeed worth noting that in 1987, two-thirds of Britons felt that same-sex relations were “always wrong”. Should Labour therefore have thrown LGBTQ people under a bus as a matter of electoral expedience in the late 1980s?Few would now admit they think Labour should have done as such now: but just look at what has become perhaps the totemic issue of so-called “woke” politics – trans rights. The tunes being played against trans people today are straight from the press campaigns against gay and bisexual people in the 1980s and 1990s. Piers Morgan has expressed his shame over describing EastEnders’ first gay kiss as a “homosexual love scene between yuppie poofs” in the 1980s, but lacks the reflection to wonder whether he will be driven to make the same apologies in 30 years over his rants about gender.Long before the Corbyn era, New Labour found itself demonised as the high priests of “political correctness”: who can forget Harriet Harman parodied as “Harriet Harperson”, and the likes of Peter Hitchens claiming they were achieving their revolutionary aims through “political correctness” and “open borders”. Not that New Labour should be absolved of their role in today’s backlash. They stopped talking about the working class, but championed the rights of LGBTQ people and women, creating the false impression that they were mutually exclusive they presided over a growing housing crisis, which allowed the right to claim that working-class people were forced to compete for scarce resources with foreigners and as people from EU accession states came to the UK, they refused to make a pro-migrant argument. All of this fed the myth that the interests of working-class people and minorities were counterposed: that “you only care about them, you don’t care about us”.Whoever becomes Labour leader, the voices demanding a tack to the right on social issues must be resisted. It would be a betrayal of Labour’s fundamental purpose. It erases the reality of the modern working class, which includes women, people of colour and indeed people who are LGBTQ. It also conjures up an utterly patronising caricature of the working class. The real ide on social issues isn’t based around class, but rather age: younger working-class and middle-class people are significantly more socially progressive than their parents, let alone their grandparents.And while the under-40s are voting for Labour in unprecedented numbers, they are less partisan than previous generations, and will gladly defect if Labour shifts right on women and minorities. Stand your ground: granting the right victory in its so-called “culture war” is a recipe for both moral and political suicide."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7a21686dfcfb68e3545d63a6d9fcd4cd941bfbe4/0_132_3960_2376/master/3960.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=da4f4c66e84259c4107d99acaf4146c4","title":"tories blue wall voters stereotypes","story":"In the weeks since the election, the Westminster agenda has been focused on the politics and economics of place. That’s because of some very specific locales: the 50 seats across north Wales, the Midlands and the north that switched from Labour to the Conservatives. These seats, in what was once Labour’s “red wall”, and is now being described as a “blue wall”, put Boris Johnson’s government into office. And it is the desire to hold on to those seats that lies behind its programme of tackling Britain’s damaging geographic ides – what it calls “levelling up”.But defining that programme means understanding those constituencies. Crucially, it means getting beyond stereotypes. Too often we hear these former Labour strongholds characterised as poor, left-behind towns that the young are leaving in droves, when the reality is far more complex.The town part of the label is at least broadly true – these seats are indeed larger towns or smaller cities. More than two-thirds of residents across the 50 constituencies live in towns, compared to just under half of the population as a whole.But these towns and cities are not the poorest parts of Britain. Yes, they are much poorer than traditional Conservative seats – with typical pay £44 a week lower. But that is really down to the wider north-south ide and higher pay across London and the south-east. If we focus on the regions that these seats sit within, typical earners actually take home £9 a week more on average than in Labour seats in the same areas.Calling these places old is also wide of the mark. The average age of residents in these seats is 41 – just 0.7 years above the UK average. This is exactly why these are the new swing seats in Britain – they are middle-aged in a country that is becoming increasingly polarised by age. And the idea that these seats have seen a youth exodus is simply false: far fewer young people are leaving than in Labour seats, or other Conservative seats. Indeed, fewer people of any age are moving out, or for that matter moving in – either from other parts of the UK or abroad. As a result, their population growth since 2002 is half that of the rest of the country.So while the Tories’ new seats aren’t poorer than the rest of the country, their relative economic decline explains the government’s “levelling up” agenda and focus on the specific challenges in those places, as well as its desire to close the broader north-south regional ide. Transport plans need to go well beyond the big intercity trains that make headlines to more local improvements, strengthening the economies of the blue wall directly. Investing in skills will reinforce such an approach.The government’s attention to its new seats is welcome, but while new road and rail links are needed, they will inevitably take time to arrive. In the meantime the “levelling up” agenda risks being taken backwards by the one big government reform that we know is definitely coming to the blue wall in this parliament – universal credit. Unintentionally the design of the new benefit system means there will be many more losers in the north than the south, something that is currently receiving no attention in government.Of course, understanding the demographic and economic shifts taking place across these seats can only get you so far. It’s equally important to listen to what people want, and appreciate that different areas will have different priorities.All governments need big, clear agendas to help them prioritise. “Levelling up” the new Tory seats, and Britain more generally, is a worthy aim, irrespective of whether it’s partly based on cold electoral logic. And the only way to do it is by starting with facts, not stereotypes.• Torsten Bell is chief executive of the Resolution Foundation"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4f2b6fd2e567e0f339ce34243bb34e300a1eb0c2/0_436_6543_3926/master/6543.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fa139130bb3b1b23d03b84f817d2b067","title":"valentines day holding hands in a and e","story":"My husband and I were celebrating our anniversary in front of the TV.

I confess we are not excessively romantic about it: February is usually when my husband disappears for a budget adventure holiday on which I refuse to join him. Meanwhile, quizzed by a civic official recently, I had to take off my wedding ring to check when we got hitched (it’s engraved in there – not our idea, obviously). Sometimes I think wistfully of champagne and roses, but then I remember champagne gives me gut rot and I have destroyed his romantic impulses with my weirdly rigid definition of what flowers are acceptable (definitely not roses).This year’s celebration started with a romantic trip to purchase a new salad spinner. Later we bickered about local planning applications and compared heated clothes rails online, each on our own laptops. After a stodgy dinner à deux, we watched a documentary about Whitney Houston’s drug-fuelled demise. Then, a surprise: a laconic message from our teenaged son, at a party: “Funny story, I’ve hit my head.” A rainy drive, a kind stranger’s house, then that romantic staple: A\u0026ampE at midnight.There was an odd romance to it, actually. Sure, the strip lighting, the promised six-hour wait on the whiteboard, the hushed huddled masses don’t immediately scream hearts and flowers. Nor do kidney-shaped cardboard bowls, coronavirus warnings and a well-oiled man in a wheelchair singing about how you can break your ankle “just from walking if you’re drunk enough”. But it gave me time to reflect on all those years: all the minor and major dramas, humdrum weekends and WhatsApp bin squabbles that make up our shared life.

Work with your staff to address their needs, whether this is providing a height-adjustable desk to accommodate a wheelchair, investing in software that is tailored to a range of abilities, or providing specialised mentoring. Employers must make “reasonable adjustments” to avoid staff with disabilities from being put at a disadvantage compared with non-disabled workers as a legal requirement. Accessibility shouldn’t be the responsibility of one person – it should be a part of the culture of your business.Be proactive in hiring erse talentThe Open University has the highest number of students with disabilities of any higher education institute in the UK. It offers digital career fairs through OU Online TalentConnect, a platform that encourages students who might otherwise find it difficult or impossible to attend a face-to-face event. “Nearly 6,000 students attended the online careers fairs we held last year,” Ellen Cocking, head of the OU’s Careers and Employability Services, says, “and we are seeing more and more interest from employers in our digital answer to campus engagement.” You could also work with disability specialists such as Remploy to ensure that your job postings are reaching a wide audience.Offer workplace trainingOrganisations such as Remploy offer comprehensive training on a range of disabilities, ensuring that your workforce understands the complexities of accessibility issues. It’s also worth offering unconscious bias training to your staff – the more aware your workforce is, the more empathetic and understanding they are. It’s worth remembering that not all disability is visible, nor is it the duty of the person with different abilities to educate others about what disability looks like for them. By making your staff more aware of their biases, you have the potential to change behavioural patterns and habits in the workplace.Is your website accessible?If you want to attract exceptional candidates, make sure that your job application portal is accessible to people with a range of abilities. If your website is difficult to navigate for some, it creates a barrier between your business and potential employees. Make sure that both your job application portal, and your business website have a range of accessibility options – such as screen magnifiers, speech recognition, colour and brightness adjustments, and image descriptions. This is essential for ensuring your business communicates to everyone, and also signals to site visitors with accessibility needs that your business cultivates a culture of inclusivity.Offer flexible andor remote workMany people with disabilities are let down by infrastructure, meaning that even if your workplace is the most accessible place on Earth, staff with mobility impairments may not be able to get there. When putting together a job description, consider whether the role could be performed remotely. For many people with disabilities, the flexibility of alternative hours, or the ability to work from home is a game changer.Become a Disability Confident employerDisability Confident is a government programme that offers guidance and support to both employers and jobseekers, and signing up to it signals to jobseekers with a range of abilities that your business supports and encourages an environment of inclusion for workers with disabilities. It also aids in removing barriers to entry, which many people with disabilities or long-term health problems frequently experience.Empower your business.

She added in another Tweet: “As a wheelchair user, I don’t have any option ... most days I don’t even have a desk.”Da Silva told the Tab that the university has repeatedly failed to accommodate her disability.The incident occurred last Friday, when she ended up stuck in the corner of the stairwell after realising there was no means for her to get down into the room.“I turned and saw the stairs and panicked, I stopped,” she told the Tab. “The next 10 minutes was people arriving, them looking at me and then sometimes asking what was going on. I just told them I can’t get down and to just go past me.”The first-year student said the problems started with her first lecture in September, in a lecture theatre where access to the room was at floor level.“Everyone walked up the stairs to take their seats and I was left with nowhere to go – no desk, no seats next to me for other students and I’m right next to the lecturer. I was made to feel like an ‘other’,” she said.Da Silva told the Tab she had raised the issue “countless times”. But the student added that, while the university had made room changes for some of her lectures, she still repeatedly found they were held in inaccessible spaces.“A lot of the time there are no desks for me. If there are, they’re moveable desks, but the wheels are always locked and I can’t bend down that far to unlock them, so everyone in the theatre looks on at me whilst I struggle to get a desk,” she told the Tab.Dr Anji Gardner, Hull’s Director of Student Services, said: “We’re very sorry that this has happened, clearly it is not acceptable. We take these matters very seriously and are looking into what has happened.“We are committed to working with our students to put in place any additional support or adjustments where needed. Unfortunately, it is clear this hasn’t happened in this case. We will immediately look into this and ensure that we take necessary steps to make sure this does not happen again.”Piers Wilkinson, disabled students’ officer, for the National Union of Students, said: “Universities across the sector are still consistently failing to provide basic access for disabled students.

The ambition is supported by 10 aims.Five aims to get BP to net zero:1. Net zero across BP’s operations on an absolute basis by 2050 or sooner.2. Net zero on carbon in BP’s oil and gas production on an absolute basis by 2050 or sooner.5. Increase the proportion of investment into non-oil and gas businesses over time.Five aims to help the world get to net zero:6. More active advocacy for policies that support net zero, including carbon pricing.7. Further incentivise BP’s workforce to deliver aims and mobilise them to advocate for net zero. 8. Set new expectations for relationships with trade associations. 9. Aim to be recognised as a leader for transparency of reporting, including supporting the recommendations of the TCFD. 10. Launch a new team to help countries, cities and large companies decarbonise.BP is responding to criticism that it lobbies against climate action and withholds information about its carbon footprint. In the future, the company says it will encourage staff and trade associations to promote net zero policies. This could be an important shift, but the devil is in the detail (see below). To deliver the ambition, BP will fundamentally reorganise to become a more focused, more integrated company, comprising:· Four business groups to deliver performance and value growth: Production and operations customers and products gas and low-carbon energy, and innovation and engineering.· Three integrators to identify and maximise opportunities: Sustainability and strategy regions, cities and solutions, and trading and shipping.· Four core enablers to support business delivery: Finance legal people and culture, and communications and advocacy.BP will reorganise. What this means for the climate will depend on how much authority is given to the isions related to low-carbon energy and sustainability. If they are left on the fringe, little will change.BP is committed to performing while transforming. No change to BP’s fundamental commitments: · To safe and reliable operations.- growing sustainable free cash flow and shareholder distributions over long term- maintaining strong financial frame and cost and capital discipline, and deleveraging the balance sheetDespite the talk of change, BP is reassuring shareholders that its core priorities are the same, including more idends. This aims to reassure skittish investors who have got used to the oil company providing the third biggest payouts on the London stock exchange. The big unanswered question is whether this will be achieved as in the past – by increasing production of fossil fuels – or through a new shift to renewables.New purpose and ambition BP’s new CEO, Bernard Looney, today announces a new purpose and a new ambition for the company. BP’s new purpose is reimagining energy for people and our planet. The purpose is underpinned by an industry-leading ambition – for BP to become a net zero company by 2050 or sooner, and to help the world get to net zero – and this ambition is supported by 10 aims. To deliver all this, BP will fundamentally transform its whole organisation, and maintain its commitment to performing while transforming.If the oft-repeated phrase “performing while transforming” is to be anything other than corporate speak, the company will need to do more than reorganise management. It will have to embark on an energy transition. But there are no concrete details here about scaling down production of fossil fuels or scaling up renewables. This will raise concerns that the company thinks it can just plant trees or use other offsets to make up for ever greater petrochemical production. This would not be enough to stabilise the climate.Bernard Looney said: “The world’s carbon budget is finite and running out fast we need a rapid transition to net zero. We all want energy that is reliable and affordable, but that is no longer enough. It must also be cleaner. To deliver that, trillions of dollars will need to be invested in replumbing and rewiring the world’s energy system. It will require nothing short of reimagining energy as we know it.  “This will certainly be a challenge, but also a tremendous opportunity. It is clear to me, and to our stakeholders, that for BP to play our part and serve our purpose, we have to change. And we want to change - this is the right thing for the world and for BP.”This is a clear recognition of the scale of the challenge ahead and it is encouraging that the Irish CEO states oil companies can no longer simply justify themselves as providers of reliable, affordable energy. This has been their fallback position for many years.Helge Lund, BP’s chairman, commented: “Energy markets are changing, driven by climate change, technology and societal expectations, and the board supports Bernard and his new leadership team’s ambition for BP. Aiming for net zero is not only the right thing for BP, it is the right thing for our shareholders and for society more broadly. As we embark on this ambitious agenda, we will maintain a strong focus on safe, reliable and efficient operations and on delivering the promises we have made to our investors.”This highlights the importance of climate protests and the estment campaign. Social pressure is forcing more investors to recognise the danger of fossil fuels. The BP chairman is acknowledging the company is being pushed into action. In the past year, demonstrators have blocked access to the BP headquarters, called for halts to sponsorship of museums and the arts, and disrupted shareholders’ meetings. The markets are responding. Major investors are starting to pull out of petrochemical firms. One Wall Street analyst recently declared he was “done with fossil fuels”.BP’s new ambition to be a net zero company by 2050 or sooner covers the greenhouse gas emissions from its operations worldwide, currently around 55m tonnes of CO2 equivalent (MteCO2e) a year, and the carbon in the oil and gas that it produces, equivalent currently to around 360 MteCO2e emissions a year - both on an absolute basis. Taken together, delivery of these aims would equate to a reduction in emissions to net zero from what is currently around 415 MteCO2e a year. “This is what we mean by making BP net zero. It directly addresses all the carbon we get out of the ground as well as all the greenhouse gases we emit from our operations. These will be absolute reductions, which is what the world needs. If this were to happen to every barrel of oil and gas produced, the emissions problem for our sector would be solved. But of course, the world is not that simple the whole energy system has to be transformed and everyone has a contribution to make - producers and sellers of energy, policy makers and everyone who uses energy” - Bernard Looney. Therefore, BP also aims to help its customers reduce their emissions by halving the carbon intensity of the products it sells, again by 2050 or sooner – offering customers more and better choices of low- and no-carbon products.The promise to halve the carbon intensity of products is potentially the most far-reaching part of BP’s new strategy. It recognises that petroleum companies have a responsibility for how their products are used. Until now, they have tried to foist these so-called scope 3 emissions on to consumers.And over time BP also aims to increase the proportion of investment it makes into non-oil and gas businesses:  “We expect to invest more in low-carbon businesses – and less in oil and gas – over time. The goal is to invest wisely, into businesses where we can add value, develop at scale, and deliver competitive returns” – Bernard Looney.This language on transition to a low-carbon business is disappointingly vague. If “over time” means “after 2030”, then the shift will be too late. This caution may be the result of BP’s previous botched promises to move to solar energy under the leadership of former CEO John Browne. More detail may be forthcoming later this year when the company will unveil its next five-year strategy. The action on methane is welcome but long overdue. Petroleum companies have been under-reporting this extremely potent greenhouse gas and failing to remedy a major cause of climate disruption.The ambition also includes a series of aims targeted at supporting the world’s progress towards net zero:· More actively advocating for policies that support net zero, including carbon pricing stopping corporate reputation advertising and redirecting resources to promote net zero policies, ideas, actions, collaborations and its own net zero ambition. · Incentivising BP’s global workforce to deliver on the aims and mobilise them to become advocates for net zero increasing the percentage of remuneration linked to emissions reductions. · Setting new expectations for BP’s relationships with trade associations, making the case for BP’s views on climate change, being transparent where views differ, and being prepared to leave those where alignment cannot be reached. · Being recognised as an industry leader for the transparency of reporting, working constructively with the TCFD and other groups to develop good practices and standards for transparency of reporting. BP today announced its support for the recommendations of the TCFD.· Launching a new team to create integrated clean energy and mobility solutions and to help countries, cities and corporations around the world decarbonise.This would be a very positive step, but BPs past record on greenwashing and lobbying gives little cause for confidence. This oil company reportedly spends more than any of its rivals on influencing politicians and public opinion. BP donated $500,000 to the inauguration of Donald Trump and then pushed the White House to cut environmental regulations. It is also a member of the American Petroleum Institute, a trade organisation that has actively campaigned against climate action and undermined climate science. If BP keeps its promise to use that influence for zero-carbon goals, the political world could change dramatically.The structure of BP’s organisation – and of much of the industry – has been broadly the same for more than a century, split into separate organisations – upstream, downstream, and other businesses. To deliver its new ambition and aims, BP will now undergo a fundamental reorganisation.“We need to reinvent BP. Our historic structure has served us well but, in order to keep up with rapidly evolving customer demands and society’s expectations, we need to become more integrated and more focused. So we are undertaking a major reorganisation, introducing a new structure, a new leadership team and new ways of working for all of us” – Bernard Looney.Under the plans, BP’s existing, largely autonomous business segments - upstream and downstream - will be dismantled and the group reorganised globally into a more focused and more integrated entity, comprising 11 teams. The heads of these teams will make up BP’s new leadership team.Management restructuring that could mean a little or a lot for the climate depending on who is appointed and what power they have. For the moment, this is probably of more interest to staff and shareholders.Performance and value growth will be delivered by four business groups:· Production and operations, led by Gordon Birrell, will be BP’s new operational centre, bringing its operations together, focused on driving safety, efficiency and value growth. · Customers and products, headed by Emma Delaney, will focus on customers as the driving force for the energy products and services of the future, and on customer experience and expansion in rapidly changing markets. · Gas and low-carbon energy, led by Dev Sanyal, will unite energy teams currently dispersed around BP to create focused low-carbon solutions. It will also pursue opportunities in decarbonisation and new value chains such as hydrogen and CCUS.· Innovation and engineering, headed by David Eyton, will bring added momentum to BP’s venturing and Launchpad investments and act as a catalyst for creating value from disruptive opportunities. It will also house BP’s engineering discipline and safety and operational risk team. Three integrators will be established to find and maximise opportunities for BP: · Strategy and sustainability, headed by Giulia Chierchia, who is joining BP from McKinsey, will ensure that sustainability is embedded at the top of BP and provide a single groupwide approach to strategy and capital allocation.· Regions, cities and solutions, led by William Lin, will build relationships with regions, cities and large corporations, aiming to develop integrated energy and carbon solutions that can bring emissions down at scale. · Trading and shipping, led by Carol Howle, will build on BP’s existing deep expertise in its existing business to more effectively help BP capture new commercial opportunities and add value. Four teams will serve as enablers of business delivery: · Finance, led by Murray Auchincloss.· Legal, headed by Eric Nitcher. · People and culture, headed by Kerry Dryburgh.· Communications and advocacy, led by Geoff Morrell. Over the next few months, the new BP leadership team will focus on building their teams and on developing BP’s strategy to deliver the ambition. “Together we will aim to build a more agile, innovative and efficient BP. A purpose-driven, digitally enabled, fully integrated organisation. I’m confident that this new leadership team, together with all our people, have the skill and will to turn BP into a thriving sustainable energy business that is a force for good in a net zero world” – Bernard Looney.These personnel changes are climate positive without being revolutionary. It is good news that the head of alternative energy in BP, Dev Sanyal, appears to have been given more authority. The promise to embed sustainability at the top of BP under Giulia Chierchia sounds nice, but it also contradicts the previous assertion that shareholders (rather than the environment or society) are fundamental. Despite the planned groupwide programme of change, BP’s fundamental commitments remain unchanged – to safety and to investors. “BP needs to continue to perform as we transform. As committed as I am to making transformation happen, I am equally committed to some fundamental principles that have served us well. Safe and reliable operations will always underpin all we do, and we remain committed to meeting the promises we have made to our shareholders. We can only reimagine energy if we are financially strong, able to pay the idend our owners depend on and to generate the cash to invest in new low and no-carbon businesses” - Bernard Looney.BP’s commitment to safe and reliable operations is unchanged with safety as a core value. The new structure is expected to underpin and strengthen safety performance. BP also remains committed to its investor proposition of growing sustainable free cash flow and distributions to shareholders over the long term. It continues to be committed to a strong financial frame including deleveraging the balance sheet and maintaining capital discipline, to delivering its free cash flow targets for 2021, and to staying focused on costs and pursuing efficiencies. BP intends to host a capital markets day in September at which the leadership team will set out more information on BP’s strategy and near-term plans.Generating cash to invest in low-carbon business is another key phrase, but what it means for climate will depend how it is done. If the company were to quickly start selling off fossil fuel assets and use the money to pay idends and invest in renewables, this would be huge step in the right direction. But if it plans to generate more revenue by expanding its fossil fuel business over the next 10 years or more, BP would remain part of the problem rather than part of the solution. Currently, the latter seems more likely. The meeting in September should reveal whether the change is genuine or just more PR fluff.As with the UK government, if BP are serious about climate action, they need to set a 2030 target. Anything else is just kicking the can down the road."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dee733948fd870c3da3fd75f197f645d44434658/1_0_2294_1377/master/2294.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=96a3117c7cf06ef09ed358b947aa0595","title":"caped crusaders how little women lost the oscars but won fashion","story":"In the end – after six nominations, and a controversial omission for Greta Gerwig in the director category – the only Oscar that Little Women took home was awarded to Jacqueline Durran for best costume design. Not a truly happy ending to the story of Gerwig’s project, but perhaps an appropriate one nonetheless. Because the story of this film was that Little Women lost the awards season, but it won fashion.I am writing this from New York fashion week, where the spirit of the March sisters is alive and kicking both in the autumn collections on the catwalks and among the fashionista finery being showcased on the front row. That scene in Little Women, where the sisters stroll arm in arm in wool capes over long dresses, with crisp pie-crust collars and sturdy lace-up boots? That is the exact look that you will find striding over the crosswalks of Hudson Yards or Chelsea to the show venues, five minutes before showtime, at any point this week. (Give or take the odd Starbucks takeout coffee cup, and a few Bottega Veneta bags, obviously. Hey, I’m not in charge of continuity here, OK?) And on the catwalk, capes are already making a strong bid for next autumn’s wishlist.At Adam Lippes, the capes were soft and romantic – a floor-length claret wool version was layered over a calico dress in washed-out peach, with a frilled collar – while at Carolina Herrera, they looked crisp and urban in camel paired with white. This dual identity is precisely what makes Little Women dressing such an unexpectedly appealing trend.These are clothes that have a dreamy, dress-up quality but translate remarkably easily into a 21st-century wardrobe. Spotted on one British fashion editor here at NYFW who is already working the trend is the oversized Scarlett boyfriend blazer, £180, by the Kentish Town-based London brand Palones, the wide sleeves of which convert to a cape style with a row of buttons. A practical touch of which I feel sure Jo March would approve.Gerwig’s take on Little Women painted Amy, the most fashion-loving and apparently frivolous of the March sisters, in a sympathetic light. That Florence Pugh as Amy was the only actor other than Saoirse Ronan as Jo to receive an acting nomination at the Oscars is another signpost of how fashion-friendly this interpretation of Louisa May Alcott’s book is. Amy March gives her more famous sister Jo a run for her money in the contest to be fashion’s current muse. Several looks from the Florence-Pugh-as-Amy wardrobe created by Durran have made their way on to fashion’s most influential new-season moodboards. The ornate, V-shaped bodice of the blouse and pinafore that Amy wears in the scene where she smartly schools Timothée Chalamet in the economic realities of marriage from a woman’s perspective echoed through the catwalks this week. At Adam Lippes, there were yoke-shaped frills on an oatmeal sweater with a lace collar on the Tory Burch catwalk, Natalia Vodianova wore a black blouse with a V-shaped front panel edged in white piping, tied in a neat bow at the throat, paired with a long skirt over boots. The outfit worn by Amy in the film’s beach scene has also made a serious impression on fashion. A mididress fastened with a long row of covered buttons from collarbone to waist, paired with sturdy boots, is a front-row go-to look right now. For next season, Kate Spade’s new collection, shown this week, featured a lemon yellow dress with a pretty row of tiny buttons. The new New York show by Brock Collection, designed by Laura Vassar and Kris Brock, gave excellent contemporary Little Women vibes throughout, particularly with the long tiered day dresses in the kind of sheeny fabric that makes a lovely, rustly sound effect when you walk, which was teamed with flat riding boots.Where were we? Ah, yes, the eyelet collar, of course. The white lace contrast collar – think Peter Pan, but a little bit extra – is incoming on style from all directions, being not only a Little Women staple but also the star of last month’s super-chic Chanel haute couture show. Leandra Medine, the founder of the Man Repeller site-cum-brand and all-round modern media mogul, wore a super-sheer, dinner-plate-sized white lace Chloé collar over an olive green sweater and a camel coat to attend the Tory Burch show. Medine was seated right next to Gabi Butler and Lexi Brumback, real-life cheerleading champions and the stars of Netflix’s cult documentary Cheer, who are very much the NYFW attendees everyone is falling over themselves to sit with.The litmus test for the power of Little Women will be whether the ubiquitous boxy blazer can be usurped by the drummer-boy style jackets favoured by Jo in the film. Slightly shrunken jackets nipped at the waist have made the first stage of the transition, from screen to catwalk, elegant in black velvet with a peaked shoulder at the Tory Burch show. If they win over fashion audiences, they could be a box-office hit. Little Women may not have been the toast of Hollywood on Sunday night, but it has New York fashion week cheering in the aisles.• This article was amended on 12 February 2020.

As he sent three red shirts the wrong way and curled the ball towards the top corner, ITV infamously cut to an advertisement for Tic Tacs. The nation’s postprandial constitution thus settled by the breath-freshening and indigestion-relieving properties of the popular hard candy, live pictures from Goodison Park were restored and everyone in blue was cavorting about as though something important had happened.

Now they are thrivingBy Martin Laurence for WhoScoredSome of the best players in the Premier League have had to leave England and prove their worth elsewhere before their former clubs realised their mistakes. Kevin De Bruyne and Mohamed Salah were both discarded earlier in their careers, but they are now among the best players in the world. History could be repeating itself. Here are 10 players who were deemed surplus to requirements in England but are now excelling elsewhere in Europe.Another England defender considered dispensable by his club in the summer, Kieran Trippier had a difficult time at Tottenham last season but his departure – and the way he was not replaced – came as a surprise. His undoubted quality did not go unnoticed by Diego Simeone. Atlético Madrid are renowned for being among the most organised teams in football and their new right-back slotted in seamlessly before picking up an injury last month. He has created more chances than any other full-back in Spain and has made more tackles than any Atlético regular this season. Rating this season: 7.18Islam Slimani was a regular feature in the football gossip columns during the January transfer window and it is clear to see why. The Algerian was Leicester’s record signing when he arrived at the club in 2016 but he never really found his feet in England, or indeed during his loan spell at Fenerbahçe last season. His form during his loan to Monaco this season has come as something of a shock then. He has eight goals and eight assists in Ligue 1 this season, meaning he is either scoring or setting up a goal every 67 minutes he is on the pitch, which is nothing short of sensational. Rating this season: 7.22When Chelsea signed Thorgan Hazard from Lens at the same time as they signed his elder brother Eden from Lille he was considered little more than a comfort blanket for his esteemed sibling. Thorgan did not make a single senior appearance for the club and was shipped off to Zulte-Waregem in Belgium, before moving to the Bundesliga on loan. Borussia Mönchengladbach saw enough in one season to make that loan move permanent and last summer he joined Borussia Dortmund in a £23m deal. Having reached double figures for goals and assists for for Gladbach last season (10 apiece), he has four goals and nine assists for his new club so far this season – even though he has started just 15 games. Rating this season: 7.26Jérémie Boga graduated from the Chelsea academy but his senior career at the club equated to one 16-minute cameo in a 3-2 defeat to Burnley three years ago. Since then Boga has traded one blue for another. He spent a season on loan at Birmingham before being snapped up by Serie A side Sassuolo in 2018. The tricky winger, now 23, has scored seven goals in Serie A this season on top of that, only three players in Europe’s top five leagues have completed more dribbles than his tally of 97. Rating this season: 7.27Joselu showed fleeting glimpses of his ability during his time in England – at Stoke and then Newcastle – so fans at St James’ Park had little to worry about when he joined Alavés last summer. However, the 29-year-old has returned to Spain and proven that he is a real handful. He has won the most aerial duels in La Liga this season by a distance – all while scoring nine goals. The striker’s form has earned him eight of our man of the match awards this season only Lionel Messi has won more (10). Rating this season: 7.33Mikel Merino is another former Newcastle player who is thriving back in Spain but fans will be more annoyed about his departure than Joselu’s. The young midfielder was never given a fair crack in the north east, starting 14 of 24 league appearances in the 2017-18 season despite averaging an impressive 3.8 tackles and 1.9 dribbles per 90 minutes. After a solid debut season with Real Sociedad, Merino – who is still only 23 – has been a revelation this season, bossing the middle ground both on the ground and in the air. A call-up for the Spain squad for Euro 2020 is becoming a real possibility. Rating this season: 7.33Luis Alberto joined Liverpool from Sevilla for £7m in 2013, but he was never really given a chance in England. He spent just 258 minutes on the pitch across 12 appearances. Three years later, following loan spells at Málaga and Deportivo La Coruña, Liverpool sold him to Lazio for half of the price they bought him. He has become a star in Serie A. He has scored 18 goals and set up 30 more in the last three years and has even been linked with a move to Barcelona in recent times. Rating this season: 7.67When Manchester United signed Angel Di Maria in 2014, the excitement among their fans was understandable. He scored on his home debut before netting a sumptuous goals at Leicester a week later and all was as it should be. However, the his form noseed under Louis van Gaal’s strict defensive demands and – even though he picked up 11 assists in his one season with the club – United decided to cut their losses. In his first season at PSG he scored 10 goals and set up 18. The quality is inferior in Ligue 1, but Di María continues to shine. He recently reached double figures for assists for the seventh season in his career.

This is usually a nightmare for me, given that I only cook dishes whose instructions pass my Three Fs test: no food waste, no faff, and no frivolous ingredients while dried Iranian limes may be a standard-use ingredient for some, I know that any I buy will be used once and then spend a decade decaying at the back of my cupboard.It turns out that all it takes to do away with a painstaking multi-hour process of ploughing through webpage after webpage, is to say: “Alexa, show me brunch recipes.” A BBC Good Food menu pops up and one catches my attention: “Turkish one-pan eggs and peppers.” When I ask Alexa to open it, she tells me that it “takes 35 minutes to make and has five stars with 79 ratings”. A quick read-through confirms that the trickiest culinary feat required is cracking eggs, and that the most exotic ingredient required is parsley. I’m sold.The next step of my prep is usually even more agonising: shopping. If you wanted to brace yourself for food shortages in a post-Brexit Britain, you could do a lot worse than visit my local supermarket, in which staff automatically respond to casual greetings with: “We’re out of stock.” This time, however, I say: “Alexa, show me shopping skills” and Morrisons pops up second. I “enable skill” (skills are a bit like apps for Alexa), then all I do is tell Alexa which ingredients to add to my Morrisons shopping basket, log on to the supermarket’s website and select my timeslot. The ingredients arrive shortly afterwards, with nary a surly queue in sight.Shortly before guests arrive, I decide to set the mood. It’s Sunday, and I’m determined to usher in a new, relaxed and happy era for my reputation as a host. A soundtrack of carefree reggae seems to be the thing. I ask Alexa to “play reggae”. Bob Marley’s Three Little Birds fires up, accompanied by the lyrics scrolling down screen in gigantic font so that I find myself staring at the words: “Don’t worry ‘bout a thing, ‘cause every little thing gonna be all right.” It feels a little on the nose, given my aforementioned hosting anxiety.“Alexa, you know I’m worried – don’t you?”“Sorry, I don’t know that.”As guests turn up, I prepare a welcome cocktail of a Tom Collins, using an Alexa skill called The Bar. After a few bits of banter-tastic menu navigation (“Welcome to the bar, can I see some ID?” “Tom Collins coming right up!”) I’m given instructions and an ingredient list that let me whip up a long, refreshing citrusy drink.I tell Alexa to start reading me the recipe and I follow it step by step, using the Echo Show to set voice-activated timers as I go. By the end of it, I’ve got a shakshuka-like dish of sautéed, spicy pepper and tomato sauce encircling baked eggs – accompanied by a creamy yoghurt topping, punchily packed with parsley and garlic. Unfortunately, there was no setting to stop me mistiming how long to cook an egg for without setting the yolk into a solid yellow disc. But that aside, I’m well chuffed with the results – and by judiciously spooning the yoghurt on to the top of the egg yolks, the happy murmurs of my guests suggest I’ve gotten away with my overcooking.Food over, so it’s time for games. Asking: “Alexa, show me game skills” shows us a menu of 30 options and leads to playing a guess-who game called Akinator, which attempts to tell you which famous character you are thinking about, just by asking a few questions – we utterly outfox Alexa by selecting Tottenham MP David Lammy. We follow up with Song Quiz – which plays us clips of tracks from a set genre (we select 90s) and makes us guess artist and song title. Cue impassioned debates about decades-old R\u0026ampB, cries of “Yes!” at the hearing of nostalgic faves and an entirely unfair victimisation of the winner for being a Michael Bolton fan, due to jealousy of his excellent musical knowledge and excellent mixing of Tom Collins cocktails.The gathering ends, guests are happy, and my pulse is unlikely to trouble the emergency services. All in all: a very easy afternoon of entertaining. As my last guest leaves, they quip: “What now? You going to get Alexa to start the dishwasher?”Sigh, if only I had a dishwasher.Learn more ways to use your Alexa-enabled device"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1663670262d9e5ac7547ac3c00ccd2b87fda27ae/0_84_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2c64740b69f6ab509425c811c623036d","title":"ofcom to be put in charge of regulating internet in uk","story":"Web firm bosses could be fined or imprisoned if they do not protect users from harmful contentOfcom will be put in charge of regulating the internet, the government has announced, with executives at internet firms potentially facing substantial fines or even prison sentences if they fail to protect users from “harmful and illegal content” online.Under the proposals, Ofcom will not have the power to remove specific posts from social media platforms. Instead, it will require internet companies such as Facebook and Google to publish explicit statements setting out which content and behaviour they deem to be acceptable on their sites. The media regulator will then ensure internet businesses enforce these standards “consistently and transparently”.The culture secretary, Nicky Morgan, and the home secretary, Priti Patel, promised that changes to the proposals would guarantee free speech for adults online and only target larger internet businesses. However, some tech start-up groups warned that it would still place an enormous burden on smaller businesses to police content that is potentially harmful but not illegal.Among the proposals announced on Wednesday, it was revealed:The plan to require regulation has already raised concerns among the publishers of major newspapers, with some outlets that have campaigned for the legislation as a way of curtailing the power of internet companies fearful that their own news website comment sections could now be regulated for online harms. Ministers have previously reassured traditional publishers that they will be excluded from the legislation.The announcement was made in the government’s response to a consultation over the online harms white paper, unveiled last April. There will now be a period of lobbying, as internet companies attempt to avoid the legislation placing substantial new burdens on their businesses.“With Ofcom at the helm of a proportionate and strong regulatory regime, we have an incredible opportunity to lead the world in building a thriving digital economy, driven by groundbreaking technology, that is trusted by and protects everyone in the UK,” said Morgan.Patel added: “While the internet can be used to connect people and drive innovation, we know it can also be a hiding place for criminals, including paedophiles, to cause immense harm. It is incumbent on tech firms to balance issues of privacy and technological advances with child protection.”The regulations are broadly focused on two new sets of requirements. One, around illegal content, will give platforms new targets to ensure that such content is removed quickly, ideally prevented from being posted in the first place, with a particular focus on terrorist and child sexual abuse content.The second set of requirements, which attempt to minimise the distribution of “harmful” content, such as that which encourages or glorifies self-harm or suicide, focuses instead on putting a requirement on large online platforms to better enforce their own terms of service. The goal is that platforms which say they remove such content, and are thus safe for children to be active on, are held to that promise while platforms that focus on free speech over safety are equally clear about objectives.Those new regulations will apply only to companies that allow the sharing of user-generated content, the government says.Melanie Dawes is currently permanent secretary at the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government. She has held that position since 2015 and immediately after the UK’s vote to leave the EU she said government departments must be ready to\u0026nbsplet go of their “brightest and best” civil servants to work for Whitehall’s Brexit unit.A keen gardener, according to her relatively new Twitter profile, Dawes is married to Benedict Brogan, a former Daily  deputy editor and chief political commentator. He is group public affairs director at Lloyds Banking Group. The couple have one child.Dawes was educated at Malvern Girls’ College, now Malvern St James, in Worcestershire, before going on to New College Oxford and then Birkbeck College in London for postgraduate studies in economics.She joined the civil service in 1989 and after two years at the Department for Transport moved to the Treasury, ending a 15-year stint there as Europe director.Between 2006 and 2011 Dawes was at HM Revenue \u0026amp Customs, where she held a range of roles including director general for business tax, which involved responsibility for all business taxes and duties as well as leadership of the HMRC’s relationships with big business. From 2009 she led the development of its overall strategy.Form 2011 to 2015 she was director general of the economic and domestic affairs secretariat at the Cabinet Office, responsible for overseeing the system of cabinet decision-making.Dawes is also the government’s ersity and inclusion champion, a role she took over in 2019 from Dame Sue Owen, a former permanent secretary at the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport who has retired. Dawes was previously the government’s gender champion.\u0026nbspDame Melanie Dawes, a civil servant, has also been confirmed as Ofcom’s new chief executive, as first reported in the  last year. She has been permanent secretary at the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government since 2015 and will start at the media regulator in early March.Ofcom’s chairman, Lord Burns, will also step down later this year after the government indicated that it wanted a chair who would be able to implement its online harms programme in full over the next few years."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2064d9a60892db6f2418716f0ccc1429217aa327/0_141_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e82eb5ff0bc85ff9a0a8c50ba7393763","title":"what powers ofcom have regulate internet uk","story":"Watchdog to broadly oversee two specific areas covering illegal and harmful contentThe government is to appoint Ofcom as an internet watchdog, giving it the ability to fine social media companies that do not protect users from harmful content. The culture secretary, Nicky Morgan, and the home secretary, Priti Patel, said Ofcom’s existing position as broadcasting regulator made it suitable to enforce rules to keep the internet safe.The government has responded to a consultation it launched last year about its plans to regulate the internet. The response fleshes out some of the proposals contained in the initial online harms white paper, most importantly by naming Ofcom as the regulator that would be given power over the net.It will broadly oversee two specific areas covering illegal and harmful content. For the former, it will make sure companies quickly take down illegal content – with a particular focus on terrorism and child abuse imagery – and prevent much of it being posted in the first place.For the latter, Ofcom will primarily make sure social networks enforce their own terms and conditions. That means that if a social network says, for instance, that material promoting self-harm is banned, it will be required to take action to enforce that.The government argues that the two areas it covers suffer from a lack of regulation. For illegal content, social networks currently face an all-or-nothing approach to liability, where they are free from all penalties provided they are not seen to be actively supporting the content. The government wants the ability to use penalties to encourage speedy enforcement, and discourage companies from deliberately turning a blind eye to their own platforms.For “harmful but not illegal content”, the government says it needs to act to protect children online, and wants to create a legal duty of care on the part of social networks to ensure they face penalties for harms their platforms cause.In the short term, little. As with the implementation of GDPR, the proposals will likely lead to a flurry of small changes on the day the law comes into practice, with the more meaningful changes taking years to work through regulators and courts.Social networks have warned that anything that imposes requirements on them to take down content quickly runs the risk of encouraging them to remove false positives – material that is not actually infringing, but looks like it might be close. That means users of sites such as Instagram or YouTube might notice the platforms start becoming more censorious.“The proposals ask British startups to police legal content and then find themselves punished when they make mistakes,” said Dom Hallas, the executive director of startup trade body Coadec. “It is a confusing minefield that can only benefit big companies with the resources and armies of lawyers to comply.”But the government says any enforcement will be proportional to the size of the company, with a few other factors, such as the number of children who are users, taken into account.That is an open question. The government is leaning on an upcoming regulation from the Information Commissioner’s Office, the age-appropriate design code, to argue it is up to sites to work out whether they have younger users, and if so, to protect them from harmful content accordingly. But it also says it is examining the prospect of tools such as “age assurance” technology, initially developed for its abortive attempts to force purveyors of adult content to impose their own age gates online.We do not know, but the government says they will be “fair, proportionate and transparent”. The white paper suggested inidual executives may be held to account for failures, but now, while the response says it is “essential that company executives are sufficiently incentivised to take online safety seriously”, the government has not set out any specific policies and will not do so until it finalises its response in the spring."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d6bf2a94165bec9c58d6122dd54d8f5b7eb440d/0_87_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a4d07a1285c6c095c164e83654dca54e","title":"friends across the divide does labour have room for blairism and corbynism","story":"Peter Mandelson and Steve Howell represent the two opposite poles of the Labour party: one was a key architect of Blairism, the other of Corbynism.

As the clock strikes 11pm on Friday, the UK is officially orced from the EU and will begin trying to carve out a new global role as a sovereign nation. It was a union that got off to a tricky start and continued to be marked by the UK’s sometimes conflicted relationship with its neighbours. Here’s a run-through the beginning, the middle and the end.The French president, Charles de Gaulle, vetoes Britain’s entry to EEC, accusing the UK of a “deep-seated hostility” towards the European project.Sir Edward Heath\u0026nbspsigns the accession treaty giving entry to the EEC in an official ceremony that was accompanied by a torch-lit rally, dickie-bowed officials and a procession of political leaders including former prime ministers Harold Macmillan and Alec Douglas-Home.Lisa O\u0027CarrollMargaret Thatcher negotiated what became known as the UK rebate with other EU members after the iron lady marched into the former French royal palace at Fontainebleau to demand “our own money back” claiming for every £2 contributed we get only £1 back” despite being one of the “three poorer” members of the community.It was a move that sowed the seeds of Tory Euroscepticism that was to later cause the Brexit schism in the party.\u0026nbspCollapse of Berlin wall and fall of communism in eastern Europe, which would later lead to expansion of EU.Divisions between the UK and the EU deepened with Thatcher telling the Commons in an infamous speech it was ‘no, no, no’ to what she saw as Delors’ continued power grab. Rupert Murdoch’s Sun newspaper ratchets up its opposition to Europe with a two-fingered “Up yours Delors” front page.A collapse in the pound forced prime minister John Major and the then chancellor Norman Lamont to pull the UK out of the Exchange Rate Mechanism.On 1 January, customs checks and duties were removed across the bloc. Thatcher hailed the vision of “a single market without barriers – visible or invisible – giving you direct and unhindered access to the purchasing power of over 300 million of the world’s wealthiest and most prosperous people.Tory rebels vote against the treaty that paved the way for the creation of the European Union.

The gap between the Premiership and Championship was wide enough already before the Rugby Football Union turned it into a chasm with Wednesday’s announcement that funding to the second tier would be slashed from next season. Life was already hard for players and clubs now many fear it will be nigh on impossible to continue in their current form.For a taste of reality away from the glamour of the Six Nations and the Premiership, consider instead the story of the former Bedford Blues and Canada player Justin Blanchet. As recently as September, he was still vying for selection for his country’s Rugby World Cup squad. The week before the team landed in Japan, playing in a warmup Test against the USA in Vancouver, he suffered his fourth concussion in 12 months. With a history of head injuries already, it proved one too many for the Montreal-born back-rower.The 26-year-old’s abrupt departure from the game went mostly unnoticed among the rugby public. Yet Blanchet’s story underlines the stark realities of professional rugby, particularly that of England’s second tier. Outside the Premiership, there is no safety net if things go wrong.“There is a feeling, particularly in the Championship, of whether it is all worth it,” says Blanchet. “I became frustrated with rugby. I was giving up so much of my body, my mind and emotion. Most Championship players are on significantly less than people may think.“Personally, I just didn’t feel I was being properly remunerated. When players are earning no more than £20,000 to £30,000 and start getting injuries, questions begin coming into your head.”In the case of Blanchet, who has seven Canada caps to his name and has also played at Exeter Chiefs, last year was the final straw. “As a sports person you are selfish with a narrow view of things and my goal was the World Cup. I knew the more I told the medical team about my head injuries, the less likely I would be going to the tournament.“But my body was failing me. On top of my head injuries, within a year I had two broken arms that never felt like they were healing fully.”In the Championship, even before the current financial model is ripped up, getting injured can spell disaster financially. Blanchet considers himself one of the lucky ones because Bedford ensure their players are properly covered in terms of medical insurance. It is not the case everywhere.“It’s not great if I’m honest. You hear of horror stories from other clubs of those not covered, something that is unfathomable. In the Championship, there is no support network. It is sad to feel that in a professional setup there is no one acting on your behalf. In all honesty it feels a bit amateur,” says Blanchet, who holds an economics degree from the University of Exeter.“A few years ago, there was a story in the  about the Championship being the wild west of rugby. I think that’s bang on. I think the Rugby Players’ Association is great but the fact they don’t cover the whole of the professional environment needs to be addressed. Why is there not a group for everyone playing the game professionally?”Blanchet’s story is not uncommon in the Championship. The league may have helped numerous players along the road to international recognition but that does not paint the full picture. The English second tier is not a lush pasture for professional players to graze on, particularly if bad luck strikes.As the Premiership salary cap debate rages on, it is also worth remembering that plenty of players are being paid a pittance for taking precisely the same risks as their top-tier cousins. It is a situation that will only worsen next season when the RFU cuts the annual central funding for each club from £530,000 to £280,000. Many Championship players say they frequently feel like second-class citizens.“Just having access to work experience days would be huge, or even having an inidual for players to contact if they need help on a personal matter,” adds Blanchet. “At the moment there’s nothing. I’m lucky that I have incredible support from my family and girlfriend, but not everyone may have that.“I don’t regret rugby, it has given me some important life skills and has allowed me to meet some incredible people. Ultimately, though, the transition when you finish is incredibly challenging. I just stress to all players to look after yourself and think about life outside of rugby.”Fortunately for Saracens, their players will continue to be looked after by the RPA as part of the parachute payments that go to the teams relegated to the Championship. Funding from the RFU will also not be such a pressing issue. Blanchet’s story, though, is all too typical among those who will be dining at the same table as Saracens next season."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/77a14a3c979971f7d3989c8c58f05311967a46cf/0_140_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7bbecfb343e0c8f472e8d21287f0eb45","title":"why wont clubs invest properly in their womens super league teams","story":"Poor pitches, low wages and conditions far behind the men’s teams are common problems – and that needs to changeThe bubble is bursting. Professionalism has pushed the Women’s Super League to new heights, but that growth has stretched to the limit the infrastructures, personnel and, let’s face it, the commitment of those involved in the game’s development.Although the postponement of all six games on Sunday was unavoidable, as storm Ciara battered Britain, the scattergun cancellation of eight games before that was not because the pitches WSL teams play on are, overwhelmingly, not fit to host top-level professional teams. Birmingham’s home ground, Damson Park, the home of National League Solihull Moors, has had two games abandoned. Prenton Park, where Liverpool Women and League One Tranmere Rovers play, is a bog where two women’s games have been called off. To avoid further chaos Liverpool’s game against Arsenal on Thursday has been moved to Chester. So hard has it been to find a ground for the sister team of the likely Premier League champions that they are resorting to a pitch that straddles the Welsh border, 26 miles from Anfield.Tottenham, who play at National League Barnet’s The Hive, have had one game postponed. As have Everton, who play at National League North Southport’s ground, and Bristol City, who play at the Stoke Gifford Stadium.Players and fans deserve better. Yes, clubs have committed to token games at their main stadiums all bar Manchester United, Arsenal and Birmingham have hosted league games at their primary stadiums this term. Those gestures deserve to be applauded and celebrated. But professionalism has accelerated the change and clubs are failing to keep up with the demands that change brings. This is not about sharing main stadiums, yet. But it is time to question what is holding clubs back from properly investing in their women’s teams.Committing to funding drainage systems or pitch heaters at the ground their teams play on should be a no-brainer. Quality surfaces protect players. These are, on the whole, extremely wealthy clubs. That women’s teams currently operate at a loss should not be an issue. The trickle of resources should be flowing more freely and that the tap is not being turned is a choice.Being kind, perhaps they have been caught off guard by the demand. But these are not the only wrongs that need righting. Short‑term contracts are still the norm, low wages are standard for the majority, conditions at many clubs lag way behind the provisions afforded the men’s teams. It is not hard to at the very least share resources.Before leaving for New York City FC, the former Manchester City manager Nick Cushing said: “It was really simple for us – all it took was that the staff didn’t have a negative perception of the girls in the women’s game. When I look at maybe teams not training at their facility or playing on different grounds, I just think it’s crazy. Not crazy, but I see how simple it was for us that I don’t see why that doesn’t happen at other clubs. We have found it so easy. It comes from the top.“All of the senior leadership team support our women’s team, and believe in our women’s team. I could say they loan us their expertise – but they don’t, we are all part of the same football club.”In fact it must be harder to build anything close to that expertise from scratch as a separate enterprise than to find a way to integrate a women’s set-up.Clubs are not the only ones to have been caught napping, though. The Football Association has struggled to build the infrastructure around the league. Refereeing is at breaking point. A weekend does not pass without a litany of errors. It is no fault of the referees, who are not full-time, taking home a £120 match fee. The penalty awarded to Reading for a perceived handball by Katie Zelem, who had in fact cleanly headed the ball, went viral. All too often women’s football clips go mainstream for the wrong reasons. The ambition of the FA is, eventually, for professional referees but it has no timescale. A professional league requires professional officials. It is, again, not fair to fans, players or, for that matter, referees.It is staggering because, by all accounts, the FA was caught out by the huge increase in interest following the 2015 World Cup and failed to capitalise on it. Every plan since, the core of its Gameplan for Growth, has been to make sure those opportunities do not go to waste again. Yet here we are. The arguments for investment have been won, big attendances have been proven, TV audiences are strong, sponsors are on board it is time clubs and the FA threw themselves in head first, instead of easing in slowly.• The FA is discussing shifting next year’s Community Shield from Wembley to sidestep a clash with the Women’s European Championship finals. The curtain-raiser to the Premier League season was played at Villa Park in 2012 during the Olympics.• Barcelona beat Real Sociedad 10-1 in the Spanish Super Cup final. Marta Torrejón scored four, Alexia Putellas and former Arsenal player Asisat Oshoala both scored twice, with the Norwegian Caroline Graham Hansen also on the scoresheet.• Jess Fishlock has signed a new two-year contract with the NWSL side Reign FC.

Jordan skittles him first ball with the perfect delivery, shaping away a treat. Off-stump is cartwheeling once more. And he’s on a hat-trick. Bowled! Swing and a miss, off-stump out of the ground. Perfect death bowling.19th over: South Africa 172-5 (Phehlukwayo 18, Pretorius 1) What a great call from Morgan throwing the ball back to Wood after he was smashed to all parts earlier on. It’s worked a treat, his speedster getting him a wicket and going for just three runs. Job done. Now, they’re some chance of keeping South Africa under 180. Morgan needed Wood to find him a wicket to get a new player out there and he’s done precisely that, a leading edge from Smuts carrying to Stokes at mid-off.18th over: South Africa 169-4 (Smuts 20, Phehlukwayo 16) BIIIIG from Phehlukwayo! Jordan went for his shorter slower ball off-cutter but the left-hander saw it coming, rocking back into his crease before popping him 50 metres over the boundary. Have that. Sure enough, Jordan is right on the money either side of this with his fuller balls, deceiving Smuts then beating Phehlukwayo. A good contest, nine coming from the over. South Africa still have to find a way to 190-plus.“Hi Adam.” Hello, Jon Salisbury. “Roy’s fielding seems to mirror his batting- blinding catches or pretty ordinary misses with concentration AWOL a feature.”Yup, there’s a reason why he was the man they wanted at deep midwicket during the Super Over of the World Cup Final. At his best, few better in the sport. But, as you rightly identify, drops a fair few chances along the way as well. 17th over: South Africa 160-4 (Smuts 19, Phehlukwayo 8) Stokes followed a very good over with a not very good one, giving Smuts a delivery to swing at through square leg for four before overstepping - a sin at this stage of a T20. Phehlukwayo doesn’t take full advantage of the free hit but they still finish with 12 from the set.“Evening Adam.” Simon McMahon, hello to you. “I think the sponsors are missing a trick by not having one team in white, the other black, with string ties in national colours, and goatee beards all round. Let’s hope the game is a zinger, eh?” Yes, it’s not a great look. Then again, in Australia during the Big Bash League the kids are given a KFC bucket to put on their heads when they walk into the ground. 16th over: South Africa 148-4 (Smuts 11, Phehlukwayo 7) Phehlukwayo knows the drill here, making room first ball to swing hard at Curran and getting plenty of it, over long-off for SIX! He hits a wonderful long ball. Smuts’ turn, jumping well outside the leg stump before slapping another slower one through midwicket into the gap - four more. So, after losing a wicket first up they get 13 from it. Top stuff.There it is, the Tom Curran Slower Ball working for England. Miller tried to lift him over the rope at long-off but was early on it. Jordan didn’t miss his chance to make a proper gem of catch look easy when running back with the flight of the ball.15th over: South Africa 135-3 (Miller 16, Smuts 5) Stokes mixes up his lengths and pace well enough to prevent either batsman from getting a proper swing in. Morgan will happily take seven from the over at this stage. Between overs, the host broadcaster cuts to an interview inside a KFC container. As you do. 14th over: South Africa 128-3 (Miller 13, Smuts 2) Rashid’s turn to stick the landing and he’s so close to doing so when Smuts skies him waaaay into the sky but Roy can’t complete the catch. By the standards these fielders keep in short-form cricket, that wasn’t a difficult chance. Earlier in the over, Miller deployed his reverse sweep and struck it just well enough to record a boundary. Another compelling leg before shout to finish to Smuts... denied! Gosh, it looks very out on the TV replay that failed review earlier on really has hurt England. Rashid finishes with 123 from his four overs. Beautifully done. He dragged this right back.13th over: South Africa 118-3 (Miller 5, Smuts 1) This has been far from a perfect fielding performance from England, Roy fumbling after ing this time around, but the slow bowling has been excellent. Just five from Moeen here, all in coins rather than notes, giving him figures of 122 from his four overs. 12th over: South Africa 113-3 (Miller 1, Smuts 0) How often do we say it? Outstanding from Rashid. Three balls to Smuts, three hard-spun wrong’uns and three dots in the book. Two runs and a wicket from the over. They’re in this now.Caught at short fine! Bavuma tried to beat Moeen but he picked out that fielder instead when taking his bottom hand off the blade. He was dropped earlier in the over by Denly at deep square leg - a very tough chance - but they don’t pay for it.11th over: South Africa 111-2 (Bavuma 37, Miller 0) Earlier, Bavuma welcomed Stokes to the bowling crease with a delightful inside-out cover drive for four but he gets out of the over with a wicket and conceding just six. A captain’s dream.No reprieve this time, RvdD miscuing a pull shot off Stokes, taken nicely by Bairstow running in from the rope at backward square. They really needed that. 10th over: South Africa 105-1 (Bavuma 37, van der Dussen 30) I had started writing a sentence before the DRS projection declaring it a Hall of Fame hideous review. As it happens, he was almost certainly out to Rashid’s wrong’un earlier in the over but Morgan blew his referral during the power play on a poor challenge. Play on!NOT OUT! What?! He’s missed a full toss that has hit him in line with middle stump. Yet the DRS has it missing leg stump. REVIEW! Is van der Dussen leg before to Rashid? The umpire says yes with the full toss missed but Rassie wants another look. Stand by. 9th over: South Africa 97-1 (Bavuma 36, van der Dussen 25) Tom Curran is back, the man who went for squillions during his first over when de Kock was firing. The re-start isn’t much better, missing down the legside for a wide then tickled fine of the man on the 45 for a boundary. Lovely touch, Rassie. He then turns one into two from the next, via a clip to midwicket. Ohhh, Bavuma is into it too, scooping Curran over Buttler’s head for four. The foundation is laid for a 200-220.8th over: South Africa 84-1 (Bavuma 31, van der Dussen 18) Adil Rashid, welcome to the bowling crease. In his one opportunity during the ODIs the veteran leggie was outstanding. It doesn’t take him long to land his wrong’un here, prompting a bit shout for leg before, but it is turned down and England have lost their review. Excellent over, played with respect. That’s what years of quality service earns you.7th over: South Africa 77-1 (Bavuma 27, van der Dussen 16) In the context of what has gone so far, Wood giving away nine here looks a decent outcome. He’s bowling fast but that suits Bavuma, who finds the square leg gap with a tidy tuck for four. “Hi Adam.” Hi, Graeme Thorn. “Why is Colonel Sanders at the toss? Is this series sponsored?” You better believe it. The old man is everywhere at Buffalo Park.6th over: South Africa 68-1 (Bavuma 20, van der Dussen 14) Before the failed shout, cricket twitter went into a tailspin when Denly allowed a ball through through his legs at square leg, gifting Rassie a boundary. Later, the big No3 made room for himself to swing at Jordan and got just enough of it to sail for SIX over deep midwicket. Range hitting, they call that. So, 14 from it - a power play of 68.NOT OUT! No, it is most very much not. Indeed, he’s RvdD middled it. There were two noises with bat also hitting pad, but England’s review is burned on a bad one.IS VAN DER DUSSEN TRAPPED LBW BY JORDAN? Eoin Morgan believes so. Was it pad before bat? Stand by for the review.5th over: South Africa 54-1 (Bavuma 19, van der Dussen 1) Just what England needed. After the wicket, Moeen kept Big Rassie quiet for a couple of deliveries before getting off the mark. Bavuma added to that with four on the sweep - a very nice shot - but six off the over and de Kock’s scalp will be fine with Eoin Morgan.Miscued and gone! de Kock tried to continue where they left off in the previous over but failed to middle Moeen over midwicket, the catch instead landing safely with Denly running running in from the rope at long-on. 4th over: South Africa 48-0 (Bavuma 14, de Kock 31) Whoa, Mark Wood is very lucky not to be taken out of the attack by the umpires after just two deliveries. Right, so his first ball of the night is a chest-high full toss, which de Kock is savvy enough to somehow get away for four despite taking evasive action at the time. Next up? Another full toss on the height of his hip. The captain cleared the rope at square leg for SIX - no issues there - but it could easily have been called as a second no-ball. In those circumstances, it ends the bowlers’ day there and then. Good news for England is that their quick now finds his length but it doesn’t bother Bavuma, who twice takes him through the legside for hard-run twos before picking the gap at midwicket to finish, whipped away for a classy boundary. 20 from the over, with 36 of those coming in the last three. They’re off to a flyer.3rd over: South Africa 28-0 (Bavuma 6, de Kock 20) “Two,” calls de Kock as he pushes to mid-wicket, getting back easily. Bavuma gets his first turn for a while later in the over, sweeping two over short fine leg, then driving a couple more through cover. Byes now as well, two of those too, when Buttler fails to glove a ball that Bavuma missed. Moeen gets out of the set with nine taken from it.2nd over: South Africa 19-0 (Bavuma 2, de Kock 17) It’s Curran the Elder to begin from the other end, which was typically the option Morgan went for in New Zealand during the power play overs. de Kock flays the first but straight to cover. He uses his feet to the next, lifting the seamer over mid-on for four - just clear of Chris Jordan. If anyone was going to bring it down from the air it was him. The captain goes again down the ground, lifting him over mid-off for four more. Shot. Ooooh, and again for SIX, hitting with the wind after getting to the pitch, depositing him inside-out over cover onto the grass bank. He keeps the strike behind square, making 15 from the over. They’re away in style. Lovely striking.1st over: South Africa 4-0 (Bavuma 2, de Kock 2) Bavuma is off the mark first ball with a single to midwicket, de Kock doing the same. The TV tells me that the last time Moeen opened for England in a T20 was way back in 2014 it must have something to do with the howling wind that those at the ground have been talking about, trying to get them hitting against it. Another single to midwicket for the righthander, and one to the captain behind square. Bavuma has a pop at the final delivery well outside the off-stump but doesn’t get any of it. Top start for England.The players are on the field. Moeen Ali is opening the bowling with off-spin for England with Bavuma taking the first ball for the hosts. PLAY! “Afternoon Adam.” And to you, Adam Giles (no, not that one, if you’re reading this in Australia). “It’s a good move to bowl first with the destructive nature of this batting lineup, puts a lot of subconscious pressure on the opposition batsmen. England can comfortably hit 200+ on a good day (and I understand the boundaries aren’t the longest at Buffalo Park), so teams end up doubting their current run rate and occasionally push too hard to set what they perceive as an unreachable target, losing wickets in the process. Will be very interesting to see if Jordan and T. Curran can take advantage of this to follow on their strong form from the BBL.”Yup. I also found it interesting that Morgan was happy to cite the lack of data on the ground as a major input as to why he is bowling. This is the modern game.A lot of people are very cross that Joe Denly is still playing for England. In turn, I hope he makes a ton. But that probably says more about me than them. Very good on paper.Right, so confirmation that Dawid Malan has been dropped. Wow. He has a fantastic T20I record, averaging 57. There’s an early talking point for you. “Runs on the board are always key,” says de Kock about being asked to bat in the windy conditions. Steyn is definitely playing and Bavuma will open with the skipper. Pretorius is back into the South African team as their seaming all-rounder. “The wicket looks really good and there is a howling wind. There is not a lot of data about games that are played here.” That’s why Morgan wants them to chase. He confirms that Buttler, Wood and Stokes are all playing. Full teams shortly.Buffalo Park looks a top spot for some Wednesday evening cricket. England are wearing black armbands. This is in memory of Steve James’ daughter, Bethan, who passed away on Saturday night. Steve is a former Test cricketer, a deeply respected member of the press pack and a former member of  parish. The cricketing world is thinking of his family at this dreadful time. For some pre-game reading, Barney is in East London for the paper. This is his take on England’s final training session and the week they have ahead of them.Also, this is an excellent twitter thread from Freddie Wilde on the England team as they start this campaign. He is one of the global experts on T20 trends and tactics. From three fairly forgettable ODIs to the format that matters most in the lead up to the T20 World Cup this October. That’s the case for both sides with fixture lists stacked accordingly until they all fly to Australia for the next major tournament. It all begins in East London on South Africa’s Eastern Cape, this the first of three short-form matches to finish off England’s long and largely successful tour. They welcome back Jos Buttler, Ben Stokes and Jason Roy - all of whom were rested the last time they played a 20-over international in New Zealand last November. Word from the ground is that Buttler and Roy will open with Bairstow - dumped (or rested, if you believe that) from the Test squad yesterday - coming in at three. That should mean Malan at four, who has been an excellent T20 option. We’ll see. Eoin Morgan is in a good position with a lot of combinations to trial this week. As for the hosts, skipper Quinton de Kock had a fine ODI series with Reeza Kendricks, Temba Bavuma, Rassie van der Dussen and David Miller all looking the part. But most eyes will be on Dale Steyn with the ball. Can he make it this October? England will rotate their quicks, led by Mark Wood the Curran Brothers and Chris Jordan. Saqib Mahmood was also frugal in his ODI debut on Sunday.I’m looking forward to this one. As I said off the top, it’s the start of a massive T20 year for both nations, so the stars are neatly aligned for an exciting series. As always, I welcome your company throughout... drop me a line. Go on - do it.

She is, first of all, played by Zoë Kravitz, daughter of Lenny Kravitz and an actor of effortless cool. She dresses in thoughtless yet perfect thrifted outfits, owns a (seemingly successful) record shop employing her two best friends, has a spacious Brooklyn apartment filled with vinyls and a usable bathtub, and can easily school anyone’s music knowledge while slinging back whiskey neats. She has, in other words, all the enviable panache of a rockstar child her biggest concern is her fixation with the man who dumped her a year prior, yet High Fidelity tries – and tries very hard, sometimes entertainingly – to make you feel her romantic miscalculations are an all-consuming, relatable pain.The result is a show which is sometimes grating yet sneakily beguiling, in the way that beautiful, curated messiness can be. The Hulu show re-envisions the 2000 movie – itself an adaptation of a 1995 Nick Hornby novel set in 1980s London – in which John Cusack plays a self-absorbed record store owner relitigating his romantic past to get over an ex. This version switches Chicago for Crown Heights (and a little Williamsburg), and the Everyman Cusack for ethereal Kravitz, it keeps Rob’s fourth-wall breaks, through which to dismiss someone or something, and a plan to revisit past heartbreaks to explain how she’s alone by age 30. The gender flip smartly reorients the music of the movie now, a black, queer woman (one of Rob’s top five ex-lovers is a woman) dictates the terms of taste and asserts the vibe, even if her pop culture awareness is almost entirely music-centric (a series-long bit involves Rob talking about but never actually watching The Sopranos, a choice to ignore a television touchstone that feels pointed and also very much something I have done).The show also extends the length, perhaps to its detriment over 10 half-hour episodes, Rob stews over her ex-fiance Mac (Kingsley Ben-Adir), who dumped her a year ago and recently moved back to the city. She copes by hashing out theoretical top five lists (top five desert island artists, top five all-time heartbreaks) with her employeesbest friends Simon (David H Holmes) and Cherise (a scene-stealing Da’Vine Joy Randolph), and half-hearted relationships with men she reduces to cliches – a hot musician (Thomas Doherty, in a role originally played by Kravitz’s mother, Lisa Bonet) and Nice Guy With A Prius Clyde (Jake Lacy). Her pity party – nights out at the bar where she used to DJ, nights in smoking to old records – is soundtracked by an omnivorous, too-cool playlist (the Roots’ Questlove serves as musical consultant).Kravitz is an able actor who shines in Rob’s moments of genuine conflict, but is miscast for a role as a relatable everywoman whose self-pity is supposed to anchor a five-hour show it’s hard to take her seriously when she saunters down the street saying “New York is full of people who make you feel not enough” or proclaims she’s always dreamed of dating a musician. It would be one thing if the show was in on the joke, if Rob’s judgments of other’s stability or style or music taste as uncool were flipped or turned back on her. Instead, the show largely feeds into her sense of superiority – an influencer clique is, as she confides to the viewer, annoying and basic, an old acquaintance she uses for a night out is tiring, and she isn’t proven wrong.Spending five hours in Rob’s world is exhausting, but it’s also compelling, in part because of, unfortunately, the natural intrigue of an artful mess, but largely due to a great supporting cast – Randolph gives a depth of insecurity and creative fear to Cherise’s no-fucks-given attitude, while a capsule episode covering Simon’s top five heartbreaks (his first serious boyfriend, a charming yet untrustworthy lawyer) does more to explain the toxic lure of self-destructive love than Rob’s hours of “I’m an asshole” soliloquies.There’s hope that Rob’s self-imposed misery will sputter out into a form of resolution, revelation or genuine insight – something the structure of 10 half-hour episodes with ample asides allows her to escape too often. Rob’s asshole tendencies – abandoning others, coldness, flippancy – aren’t so much explored in this series as justified by her own sense of complicatedness, of interesting-ness. At one point in her past-heartbreak tour, she attends a dinner party at a lush Brooklyn apartment, during which an influencer-type asks her to take a photo. “Does it look real?” the woman asks, posing with a can. “Does it look fucked up and vibey?”Rob clearly views this performed cool with disdain, but it reads like the show’s underlying questions spoken aloud. Does this depiction of life in 2019 Brooklyn – the sterile neon-lit cafes and expensive coffee, the banter with the friendly bodega man (a perfect example of what Willy Staley recently termed “bodega fetishism”) – look real? Does Rob’s heartbreak look real? Do they also look fucked up, in a vibey, safely titillating way? Rob’s suffering looks as though it could be framed for a fashion campaign – vignettes of near-tears, angsty cigarettes puffs and the sallow look of just-smudged mascara. It would be nice if the pain of mid-20s regrets looked this good. Which is to say, High Fidelity often seems familiar, and sometimes fucked up, definitely vibey. That’s a solid hook for viewers, but most won’t mistake it as real."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d22667936c08c4d31f0556534a7b04c0193974f8/0_0_3444_2067/master/3444.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b7c53e17788da00cc4f4194f48d4e656","title":"pukka no more how food tv turned nasty","story":"From the Naked Chef to Bake Off, cooking shows used to be a treat to savour. But tears, food porn and class rows are turning them sour – and sickeningIn the beginning, there was the green pepper and the red tomato. Contestants had a mere £5 to fill a carrier bag with ingredients, then 30 minutes to turn them into sumptuous dishes under the watchful gaze of Fern Britton or Ainsley Harriott. The resulting concoctions included the likes of ready salted crisp cookies, banana syllabub, and rice, with everything. This was Ready Steady Cook, the cooking show staple which ran from 1994 to 2010 and which is set for a comeback later this year. But the world it returns to is lightyears away from the one that it left. In the intervening decade, food TV has gone from the quaintly homespun to reaching an apex of ridiculousness.Where once there was a fresh-faced, pukka-era Jamie Oliver extolling the virtues of mixing salad with your hands and making this thing called “ravioli”, or a wine-soaked Keith Floyd slow-cooking beef in red wine, chicken in white wine (or just drinking wine), now cooking shows have been edged out of the home kitchen and into the Michelin-starred world of molecular gastronomy. Recipes have stopped being practical and delicious and, instead, food is either an opportunity to shame – like Oliver’s classist comments on “eating well” being only a preserve of the middle classes – or an unattainable food porn fantasy streamed in Ultra HD on shows such as Chef’s Table.Take the nation’s favourite treat: The Great British Bake Off. Initially a charming display of amateur talent where the most challenging prospect would be constructing a tower of macaroons, 10 seasons in, the technical challenges have become a litany of Joycean names (care for a dampfnudel? Or aebleskiver? Maybe a simple ische windtorte?) Running out of variations on sponge, the producers appear to be rooting around in obscure, dusty recipe books in their quest for difficulty over entertainment. The 2019 series caused mass outcry from viewers as challenges such as the “maids of honour” were deemed “impossible” and double eliminations left early favourites inexplicably booted out and emotionally deflated. Watching the finalist Steph burst into tears over and over again, it was clear that Bake Off was no longer the gentle hit that had captured the nation’s hearts, and stomachs.The trend for impossible foodie TV was perhaps kickstarted by the self-appointed king of micro gastronomy, Heston Blumenthal. Forever dressed in chef’s whites and wielding his powerful glasses like a technician’s microscope, Blumenthal made his TV name in the early 2000s with fiendishly complex cooking shows that applied his Michelin-starred mentality to everyday recipes such as roast chicken and porridge. For Blumenthal, food is escapism – an all-encompassing experience that should explode all the senses and be a Promethean task to complete. Tasty and functional it is not.His latest offering, Crazy Delicious, takes this to a laughable new low. Looking like Willy Wonka’s factory on acid, the culinary gameshow takes place on an edible set where three contestants “forage” ingredients to cook for their “food gods” Blumenthal, US chef Carla Hall and restaurateur Niklas Ekstedt. The idea is for the amateur cooks to transform everyday ingredients into new “culinary experiences”. Discoveries so far have included strawberry cheesecake hot wings, hotdog profiteroles and banana tacos.It is certainly a (somewhat sickening) spectacle, but the Crazy Delicious recipes are so far removed from real life, they seem to serve no other purpose than to make us gawp aimlessly, not even salivating. And that’s without factoring in the surely gargantuan amount of food waste a programme with an edible set must produce. Instead, shows such as Crazy Delicious help to cultivate the snobbish attitudes that lead to a backlash against practical, easy food we may actually wish to make and eat. Food like that of former Bake Off winner Nadiya Hussain, who used canned spaghetti, tinned potatoes and instant noodles in her show Time to Eat, or Jack Monroe’s books for meals on a budget. Both Hussain and Monroe’s recipes have been borne from necessity – the effects of austerity – and Hussain has even urged viewers to be “less pretentious”, defending her use of cheaper alternatives.Even former queen of the Bake Off tent Mary Berry has recently said she has never eaten a takeaway, while Jamie Oliver – whose next show will teach takeaway fans to cook their favourite dishes from scratch – is on such a health crusade that he seems to have forgotten the value of no-frills thriftiness that first made him so popular as the Naked Chef.It is a fine line to tread with rates of obesity, and especially childhood obesity, on the rise in Britain there is a vital need to promote healthy food options on our screens. Yet, with austerity also increasingly impacting families’ abilities to buy healthy ingredients, the answer cannot be to just shame people through patronising programming or promote a wasteful escapism that turns food into something totally abstract.Let’s hope, then, that the return of Ready Steady Cook is also a return to the simple, feasible and fun reality of food TV. No more atomised velouté or Icelandic laufabrauð. All we need is a bag with £5 worth of fresh ingredients, a nervous guest cooking live on air, and a winning team – red tomatoes or green peppers."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2c0b108cb4f9acc499babec291b32506cbcea7c6/0_222_4054_2433/master/4054.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4fc300af0e285283659289be2ed7d982","title":"democrats new hampshire bernie sanders moderates","story":"The Vermont senator claimed a ‘great victory’ on Tuesday night – but he was trailed closely by a pair of midwestern moderatesAfter the Iowa caucuses failed to produce a clear winner last week, the results of the New Hampshire primary on Tuesday night helped crystalize the presidential primary - only insomuch as it appears to be a fiercely contested battle between Bernie Sanders and any candidate who can stop him.From a sports arena in Manchester on Tuesday night, the Vermont senator and self-declared democratic socialist claimed “a great victory” and declared the “beginning of the end of Donald Trump”, while his rivals sought to convince Democrats nervous about a Sanders nomination that they were the most viable alternative.Sanders was trailed closely by a pair of midwestern moderates: Pete Buttigieg, the 38-year-old former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, who rose from political obscurity to effectively tie Sanders in the Iowa caucuses last week, and Senator Amy Klobuchar, who finished a promising and surprise third after presenting herself as an antidote to the “extremes in our politics”.In a dismal finish, Senator Elizabeth Warren, from neighboring Massachusetts, and the former vice-president Joe Biden, who has led the field nationally since entering the race early last year, did not meet the threshold to earn delegates in the state.But the primary race remains deeply unsettled, with everything to play for. All five leading candidates in New Hampshire determined to move ahead to the next series of contests in Nevada, South Carolina and beyond to Super Tuesday on 3 March, where a self-funding billionaire candidate – the former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg – lies in wait, having made the risky decision to skip the traditionally crucial early voting states.Many in the party are worried that the fractured state of the opposition to Sanders will allow the senator to slip by, charting a similar path to the nomination as Trump did in 2016.But the road for Sanders is hardly straightforward. In 2016, he carried the state by 22 points over Hillary Clinton. In 2020, he won by less than 2 points, raising questions about his ability to expand beyond his core base of support from young voters and liberals.“We have been told by some that you must either be for revolution, or you are for the status quo,” Buttigieg told his raucous supporters on Tuesday night in Nashua. “Most Americans don’t see where they fit in that polarizing vision.”At Klobuchar’s rally in Concord she said Trump’s “worst nightmare” would be to give the “people in the middle” someone to rally behind in November.But there are immediate questions about where these two go next. With a higher national profile and and a more robust fundraising operation, Buttigieg is perhaps better poised to capitalize on the momentum from these early contests. But he has failed to prove he can win support from black and Latino voters, which will be critical.Klobuchar, who only recently jumped into the top three after a well-reviewed debate performance on Friday and an influx of campaign donations, has even less of a footprint in the forthcoming contests. She’s scrambling to send staff to Nevada, which holds a caucus in just 10 days, on 22 February.Warren, who has billed herself as the “unity candidate”, and Biden, who has staked his campaign on the promise that he is the most electable general election nominee, now face serious questions about how much longer they can continue.In an election day memo to supporters, Warren’s campaign manager, Roger Lau, sought to reassure supporters that the senator was prepared to go the distance.“The road to the Democratic nomination is not paved with statewide winner-take-all victories,” he wrote. “Warren has proven the doubters wrong before.”Biden’s campaign argues that a reversal of fortunes awaits in the erse states to come. But national polling has already recorded a significant drop in his support.Sanders edged past him for the first time in a Monmouth poll this week as a pair of billionaires, Bloomberg and fellow candidate Tom Steyer, peel away critical support from black voters.On Tuesday, Biden canceled plans to spend primary night in Nashua and instead flew to South Carolina, which has become a must-win after back-to-back losses.“It ain’t over, man,” Biden told supporters at an event in Columbia, South Carolina, on Tuesday night. “We’re just getting started.”The chaotic spectacle in Iowa, and the specter of a lengthy primary filled with jostling candidates, has left Americans with a dim view of the Democrats’ chances in November. Two-thirds of voters believe Trump will be re-elected, even though most Americans disagree that he deserves a second term, according to a Monmouth poll released on Tuesday.Trump, emboldened by his acquittal in the Senate impeachment trial last week, has delighted in the early chaos consuming the effort to choose his opponent. At a rally on the eve of the New Hampshire primary, he asked why voters would trust the Democrats when they “can’t even run a caucus in Iowa”.Ever the pundit, Trump offered his snap analysis on the evening’s developments on Tuesday, claiming on Twitter that Warren is “sending signals that she wants out”.“Calling for unity is her way of getting there, going home, and having a “nice cold beer” with her husband!,” he said.After the race was called for Sanders, he tweeted: “Bootedgeedge (Buttigieg) is doing pretty well tonight. Giving Crazy Bernie a run for his money. Very interesting!”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2796e45186077013d6747b4536591d901ba71407/0_0_4192_2516/master/4192.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cfaff4a7574807c1c85abba3021fa7d2","title":"who is amy klobuchar the third place finisher in new hampshire","story":"The Minnesota senator shone in last Friday’s debate but faces a tough task to unite centrist voteWhen the results came in from the three tiny towns that traditionally vote first in New Hampshire, Amy Klobuchar posted them straight to Instagram. “We’re off to a great start in New Hampshire today!” the Minnesota senator wrote about the midnight tallies from Dixville Notch, Millsfield and Hart’s Location, which showed her ahead of the Democratic pack with a total of eight votes.Some of the credit can go to her punchy performance in Friday’s debate, in which she attacked Buttigieg for his youth and inexperience, telling him that “59 – my age – is the new 38 up here”. The jab also drew attention to the fact that the other top contenders – Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Joe Biden – are all in their 70s.Klobuchar also criticised Buttigieg for saying he would rather watch cartoons than Donald Trump’s “exhausting” impeachment trial. “It is easy to go after Washington, because that’s a popular thing to do,” said Klobuchar. “It is much harder to lead, and much harder to take those difficult positions.”While Buttigieg presented himself as a “cool newcomer”, she said, “I don’t think that’s what people want right now. We have a newcomer in the White House and look where it got us. I think having some experience is a good thing.”Klobuchar was born in Plymouth, Minnesota, in 1960. After studying at Yale and the University of Chicago Law School, she practised as a lawyer and then moved into politics. She joined the Senate in 2006 and gained a reputation for working across the aisle, taking a trip to the Baltic states and Ukraine with the Republicans John McCain and Lindsey Graham in 2016.She played a memorable role in the heated confirmation hearings for the supreme court justice Brett Kavanaugh in 2018, asking the judge if he had ever been blackout drunk. “I don’t know. Have you?” he asked, repeating the question aggressively. “I have no drinking problem,” she replied calmly. Minutes before, she had talked about her father’s struggles with alcoholism. Kavanaugh later apologised.Klobuchar has been accused of bullying by former staff members, with one aide allegedly hit by a flying binder. A bizarre story recounted by the New York Times claimed she used a comb to eat a salad in the absence of a fork and then gave it a staff member and told them to clean it. “Am I a tough boss sometimes? Yes,” she has said when asked about the allegations. “Have I pushed people too hard? Yes.”Her policies as a presidential candidate are probably best described in relation to her more leftwing rivals. She thinks the “green new deal” – a proposed programme to tackle climate change and create jobs – is too ambitious and expensive, and she makes the same argument about Medicare for All, a policy backed by Sanders and Warren that would replace the health insurance industry with a publicly run scheme.Aware that she needed to seize her moment in the national spotlight, Klobuchar used her speech in New Hampshire on Tuesday night to look past her party and address the nation. “Hello America, my name is Amy Klobuchar and I will beat Donald Trump,” she vowed.But she faces an uphill struggle to unite the Democratic centrist vote, which is now split between Buttigieg, Biden and her, plus Michael Bloomberg who plans to join the race on 3 March for Super Tuesday. “There is no evidence that she can get non-white voters,” one Democratic source told Politico. She is polling in low single digits in Nevada and South Carolina, the next states to vote, and is doing only marginally better nationally.As Sanders surges forward on the left and Biden fades, Klobuchar has a small window to make her case."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/125a1957a172170e7f475a83c4412c274e4512af/0_180_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ab31d9a569470d97e7c89ff3aae08183","title":"what coronavirus precautions are you taking","story":"We’d like to hear from readers how they are reacting to reports of new infections in the UKAs the number of people in the UK who got infected with the coronavirus has risen to eight and a second Brighton GP surgery has closed temporarily because of the outbreak, the risks associated with the new virus have become more concrete in Britain.A leading health epidemiologist has claimed that the coronavirus epidemic could spread to about two-thirds of the world’s population if it cannot be controlled, and the British government has declared the virus an “imminent threat”.We would like to hear from  readers in the UK how they are responding to these warnings.

At the end of a heated debate, the majority of the senators voted to lift Salvini’s immunity and authorise the trial. The exact numbers of members who voted to authorise the proceedings will be made public later on Wednesday.Before the vote, Salvini said the decision to prevent the migrants from disembarking was made with fellow members of government and, on Twitter he paraphrased a quote by the poet and fascist sympathiser Ezra Pound: “If a man is not willing to fight for his ideas either his ideas are worth nothing, or he is worth nothing.” Salvini then said in the senate: “I want to go to a courtroom with my head held high. Defending the borders was my duty. I am proud of what I have done, for my children and for the children of this country. Let’s have a judge decide if I’m a criminal or if I was just doing my job.’’The Pro-Europe party’s leader and member of the senate Emma Bonino said she voted to authorise the criminal case “to give Salvini the opportunity to defend himself during the trial, not from the trial’’.Senator Gregorio de Falco, a former coastguard commander, said Salvini’s order to prevent migrants from disembarking was “an unnecessary cruelty’’.The ball is now again in the court of magistrates, who, barring surprises, will set a date for the first hearing, which will be held in Catania. Technically judges still have the power to halt the proceedings altogether.This is only the most recent legal trouble for Italy’s most powerful populist. Salvini has been placed under investigation five times in less than two years, is the subject of one ongoing trial and has been named in dozens of lawsuits for defamation and instigation of hatred.It is the first time since the media mogul Silvio Berlusconi – who was convicted in one out of 32 court cases and sentenced to four years in prison – that Italy had a political leader implicated in such a long list of judicial proceedings.One of Salvini’s first moves since he took office as interior minister in June 2018 was to declare Italian ports closed to rescue ships engaged in saving migrants fleeing Libya. There were subsequently 25 standoffs between rescue vessels and Italian authorities, some of which became the focus of investigations as prosecutors accused Salvini of illegal detention of migrants.At least three investigations against Salvini concern the alleged kidnapping of asylum-seekers. A criminal case for refusing to allow 131 migrants to disembark from the coastguard ship Ubaldo Diciotti was blocked by the senate in March 2019. At the time, Salvini could count on the support of his coalition partner, the anti-establishment M5S.Salvini’s legal troubles are not over. On 27 February, the Senate immunity panel will vote again on whether he should face trial for allegedly kidnapping 164 migrants onboard the NGO rescue ship Open Arms.Salvini seems determined to embrace the cases against him and initially instructed his League party to vote in favour of proceeding with the court case, with the clear intention to use it as a political weapon, before deciding to abstain."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/55a4562cc59d50183c5890933f6df86115d0fd11/0_0_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3a4117991792207e7c20d2a8f2bf8e41","title":"pope francis decides against allowing married men to become priests","story":"Celibacy issue iding church as it seeks to address shortage of clerics in remote areasPope Francis has decided against opening up the Roman Catholic priesthood to married men – a move that will please traditionalists but dismay those who argue that easing the celibacy rule would tackle a shortage of clerics.Instead, an “apostolic exhortation” from the pontiff has focused on environmental damage after bishops from the Amazon highlighted the destruction of the region’s rainforests and exploitation of Indigenous people at a Vatican summit last year.Beloved Amazon, the papal missive, does not refer to a call from the Amazon bishops to allow the ordination of married men. The issue has become the latest point of friction between conservatives and reformers within the church, with isions thrown into sharp relief when Francis’s predecessor, Benedict XVI, publicly declared his opposition to any changes to the 1,000-year-old tradition of celibacy in the Roman Catholic priesthood.Instead, Francis urged bishops to pray for an increase in priestly vocations and suggested more missionaries be sent to remote communities where Catholics can go for long periods without receiving mass.“This urgent need leads me to urge all bishops, especially those in Latin America … to be more generous in encouraging those who display a missionary vocation to opt for the Amazon region,” he wrote.A statement from the Vatican said: “The Amazon challenges us, the Pope writes, to overcome limited perspectives and not to content ourselves with solutions that address only part of the situation.”From the first papal visit to Ireland, in 1979, by John Paul II, to the second, by Pope Francis, in August 2018, the republic has steadily overturned Catholicism\u0027s teachings on marriage and relationshipsPope John Paul II makes the first papal visit to Ireland, kissing the ground at Dublin airport on arrival. Over three days, 2.5 million people - half the population of the island of Ireland - turn out to greet him.A law allowing contraceptives for “bona fide family planning” comes into force. It was described by Charles Haughey, then Taoiseach, as “an Irish solution to an Irish problem”.The law is amended to allow anyone over 18 to buy contraceptives in a chemist without prescription.Leo Varadkar, an openly gay politician of Indian heritage, becomes Taoiseach. Varadkar was born in January 1979, nine months before Pope John Paul\u0026nbspII’s visit to Ireland.Pope Francis due to make the second papal visit to Ireland.The Amazon synod brought together bishops, Indigenous people and activists from nine countries for a three-week meeting at the Vatican. The synod’s final document called for the ordination of “viri probati” – married men of good standing – and for an increased role for women in the church.The issue exploded into the open last month with the publication of a book, From the Depths of our Hearts: Priesthood, Celibacy and the Crisis of the Catholic Church, which included an essay by Benedict. “I cannot keep silent,” the former pope, 92, said in a vigorous defence of clerical celibacy.Amid furore over the book, Benedict later requested the removal of his name as the co-author with conservative cardinal Robert Sarah of Guinea.Although any easing of the celibacy rule was expected to be limited to specific circumstances, traditionalists feared it would inevitably lead to an end to the bar on married priests. Some said the proposal was heretical.Progressives had hoped that Francis would back change, but the pope made his views clear last year when he told reporters: “Personally I think that celibacy is a gift to the church. I would say that I do not agree with allowing optional celibacy, no.”Chris McDonnell of the Movement for Married Clergy said the pope’s silence on the issue was a “great disappointment. He hasn’t ruled it out, but he hasn’t even given it a mention. But this will be grist to the mill of the traditionalists.”The pope does not directly address the call from the Amazon bishops to ordain women as deacons, which would allow them to preach and conduct some ceremonies, but not say mass.He writes: “For centuries, women have kept the church alive in those places through their remarkable devotion and deep faith. But a move to ‘clericalise women’ would not enhance their value.”Instead, he urged “other forms of service and charisms that are proper to women and responsive to the specific needs of the peoples of the Amazon region at this moment in history”.The papal document defended the rights and legacies of Indigenous people and the environment in the Amazon. Francis said the rights of the poor should be respected, their cultural riches celebrated and the Amazon’s natural beauty and life should be preserved.The Amazon’s ecological problems should not be separated from social issues, Francis said. He pleaded for justice for marginalised Indigenous people forced out of their homes due to illegal deforestation and mining, to the outskirts of cities marked by “an increase of xenophobia, sexual exploitation and human trafficking”.He added: “The businesses, national or international, which harm the Amazon and fail to respect the right of the original peoples to the land and its boundaries, and to self-determination and prior consent, should be called for what they are: injustice and crime.”Clare Dixon, of the Catholic aid agency Cafod, said: “The pope is pointing to the Amazon as a microcosm of the crisis we are facing – with the fires, pollution and displacement we’ve seen in the region showing the deadly interaction of poverty and the destruction of nature.“But Francis is also imploring us to listen to the wisdom of the people of the Amazon, insisting that we learn from the way they live with the environment rather than in competition with it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b36c7a1f36b0630427c26eaa1572c1ce409c8a24/58_239_3322_1993/master/3322.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=295a68ad9b42fd5e4c00c99040b58f99","title":"rios world famous school for samba in pictures","story":"Such is the reputation of the Paraíso de Tuiuti samba school in Rio de Janeiro that dancers travel from as far afield as the UK, Russia and Japan to train in the ways of hip-swivelling and hot-stepping.

Photograph: Pawel KopczynskiReutersThe Irish government unwittingly purchased and operated encryption equipment from a company secretly owned by the CIA in the 1980s, according to classified documents.The equipment gave the American intelligence agency, and consequently the British government, access to most encrypted messages sent and received by the Irish government from officials abroad during the sensitive period leading up to the 1985 Anglo-Irish agreement.According to a detailed report in The Washington Post on Tuesday, citing a classified CIA internal history, Ireland was one of 62 named countries which purchased equipment from Crypto AG, a company wholly owned by the CIA and West German Intelligence (BND) and operated as a joint intelligence-gathering venture.Security sources confirmed to The  the government purchased an encryption device and accompanying manuals for more than £900,000 (€1.07 million) in the early 80s to allow it to securely communicate with its embassies and officials abroad.The CIA’s knowledge of the inner workings of Crypto AG equipment allowed it to easily intercept and decode diplomatic cables, the documents stated.They do not detail what intelligence was gathered from Ireland or how it was used. However, they state the CIA was happy to share intelligence gathered from other Crypto AG users, such as Argentina, with its British counterparts.In the Irish case this would have included sensitive information about the government position on Northern Ireland as it attempted to negotiate a greater role in its affairs in mid-1980s.In line with its standard security policy, the Department of Foreign Affairs yesterday refused to comment on the matter, including on when or if the government stopped using the machine.Many countries stopped using the devices with the arrival of online encryption methods, although the documents indicate the CIA operation is still live.Security expert and retired deputy director of Irish Military Intelligence Michael Murphy said the revelations should not come as much of a surprise.“Small states like ours, who don’t develop their own encryption equipment and have to buy it in, must assume someone else is always listening,” he said."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4170335.1581427029!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"irish reunification now on the table former foreign office head says","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSimon Fraser says Europe has more experience negotiating trade deals than the UK.Reunification of Ireland and the future status of Scotland are issues “definitely on the table” as a result of Brexit, the former head of the UK Foreign Office and Diplomatic Service has said.Simon Fraser, chief policy adviser to two British foreign secretaries, William Hague and Philip Hammond, said a decision to pull out of the EU complicates the union of Britain and Northern Ireland.“Brexit does complicate, in my view, the future status of both Scotland and Northern Ireland, if you look at it from the British aspect,” he said.“I think these questions are definitely on the table in terms of the future of our union.”In relation to the North“that does raise the question of the future of Northern Ireland in its relationship with the Republic”, he added.Speaking to RTÉ Radio One, Mr Fraser said time will tell “how things evolve”, adding that the “official position” in London is that the United Kingdom remains the United Kingdom.The former senior civil servant, who ran the UK’s embassies worldwide and sat on the National Security Council, was responding to calls by Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald for the EU to “take a stand” on Irish reunification as it did with the reunification of Germany.In an interview with BBC’s Newsnight programme, Ms McDonald — who has declared she may be the next taoiseach as coalition talks get under way – said her party would be “making asks of the European system in terms of long-term Irish interests and on the issue of partition”.Mr Fraser said the consequence of no hard border in Ireland under the withdrawal agreement was to “accept some sort of border between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.”“The question is what is that going to be… that’s the conundrum that has yet to be resolved,” he added.Mr Fraser also suggested Britain faces being outmanoeuvred in post-Brexit trade deal talks because it doesn’t have the expertise for such negotiations compared to other countries.Member states of the EU have their trade negotiations done by the European Commission, he pointed out.“I myself was there for several years doing that,” he said.“It is true that we don’t have the national capacity that say the Americans or the Japanese or the European Commission have."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4171549.1581523688!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"labour party leader brendan howlin announces resignation","story":"The leader of the Labour\u0026nbspParty Brendan Howlin has announced his resignation.The party won six seats in the general election, down from a high of 37 back in 2011.Speaking to his colleagues on Wednesday afternoon, Mr Howlin informed them of his intention to stand down as leader once the process to elect a successor has been completed.Deputy Howlin has asked the Labour Party general secretary to begin making the arrangements for the nomination process and the membership election.Labour’s Executive Board will meet on Saturday, February 15th to approve the arrangements for the election of a new leader.Speaking after the meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party, Brendan Howlin said:“It has been an honour to lead the Labour Party but now is the right time to pass on the baton to a new generation.

Shane P O’Reilly, Fianna Fáil cathaoirleach of Cavan County Council, said he has “never seen such anger” among party activists as he has since the outcome of the general election. Rank-and-file members countrywide were “absolutely hurting” from the electoral losses, which he blamed on a decision at leadership level to fight the election “not on policy but on personalities”. “Far be it from me to start calling on leaders to resign, or headquarters staff to be chopped . . . a word said in haste can often be regretted later,” he told Northern Sound radio station.Mr O’Reilly said Mr Martin’s future was a decision for himself. “I’m not going to tell the man to resign, I not going to tell the man what to do. I have my own opinions on it . . . there is a lot of anger.” The party as a whole “needs to do some soul searching”, he added. Mr O’Reilly said there is an “extreme disconnect” between the Oierachtas and people on the ground, adding that party members are “taken for granted”. “It is atrocious what has happened us,” he said. “It is time for us as a political party to have a damn good look after ourselves.”Fianna Fáil Cavan councillor John Paul Feeley said he was “mystified that the party leader seems to be talking about the formation of a government.” “I think it’s extraordinary at this stage that he hasn’t seen the light that we have been very poorly led during this campaign and indeed well before it,” he added. “I think that Micheál Martin really needs to consider his position. I think if he had any decency he would have resigned already. I think there needs to be a clean sweep in terms of the national organisation.”Mr Feeley also attacked what he called a “very bland front bench” in the party, saying he would have difficulty identifying the brief held by any more than four or five of them.Meanwhile, Sinn Féin is warning other parties of an “urgency” in forming a new government, as it vows to “intensify” coalition talks as quickly as possible.Pearse Doherty, the party’s chief negotiator in attempts to form an administration, said the party will be telling smaller left-leaning parties on Wednesday there is a “huge opportunity to change the face of Ireland.”“We don’t want to sit back,” he said.“We think there is an urgency in relation to this – there should be no delay in government formation. There are big issues that need to be sorted.”Fine Gael Minister for Agriculture Michael Creed also said it was now up to Sinn Féin to sort out a government in good time, adding that a clear majority of people voted against his own party.Mr Doherty told Newstalk: “What I want to do, as the lead person in our negotiating team, is intensify this as quickly as possible. “Sinn Féin is meeting a number of smaller parties first as it launches negotiations to a form a government.Mr Doherty said it has “reached out” to the Greens, Solidarity-People Before Profit, Social Democrats and Labour.“Obviously our first port of call is to talk to those parties where we would have a common platform, to tease out with the possibility of putting together a government for change,” he said.But Labour leader Brendan Howlin is expected to tell his parliamentary party on Wednesday that his party, which won six seats, did not achieve enough critical mass in the election to enable it to enter government. Sources said Mr Howlin would leave open the prospect of Labour supporting a government from opposition on a number of key policy areas, such as housing.Mr Creed said Sinn Féin has a responsibility to deliver a “republican socialist” government given the results of the general election.The Fine Gael frontbencher appeared to give the strongest indication to date that his party was heading straight for the Opposition benches, saying a “clear majority” voted against it. While Fine Gael is a “party of government” and “would like in normal circumstances to be in government”, his party had to reflect on the outcome of the election, he said. “The clear message to us was that people want change at a pace that we weren’t capable of delivering,” he said. “It remains to be seen whether an incoming government can accelerate that.”A “clear majority of people” voted against Fine Gael and “aligned around a campaign of change so let’s see what they come up with now”, he added.

It would be far more effective that the group “seeks to agree a common position and seeks to negotiate that position with others”.Speaking to reporters Mr Boyd Barrett said his party wanted to discuss the possibility of having a left government that did not involve Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael.“When People Before Profit said at the beginning of this campaign that it was possible to break the cycle of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael and create a left wing government people laughed at us but that became the narrative of the election and now it is a real and living possibility.”He added: “I think things are changing very fast in Irish politics. The landscape is shifting and we think change is possible, a different type of Ireland is now possible.”‘More than willing’Later in a statement Solidarity said Mr Boyd Barrett was operating separately.“The meeting today is just a meeting of the People Before Profit component of Solidarity-People Before Profit, with Sinn Féin, arranged between the two parties themselves.”Solidarity “is more than willing to meet Sinn Féin or any other parties that want a real transformation so that people’s needs and the planet come before profit”.Solidarity TD Mick Barry is the party’s sole remaining TD after his colleague Ruth Coppinger lost her seat in Dublin West.Mr Murphy said later that “I think that we should and I think will do our business as a parliamentary grouping”.He said that all components of the group had slightly different approaches but they all agreed on basics and he believed it would be possible to agree a common position.Solidarity-People Before Profit is made up of three different organisations but he hoped the group would meet this week and agree a common position.Separate preparatory discussions were fine he said as people were entitled to talk to whoever they wanted to talk to, “but I think it will be best if we negotiate together”.Solidarity is expected to hold a press conference on Friday to outline its position on issues for potential talks’ discussion.Last year the parties split into three separate organisations when Mr Murphy left Solidarity but remained part of the grouping in the Dáil and retained his Dublin South West seat.People Before Profit’s three TDs retained their seats – Mr Boyd Barrett, Bríd Smith in Dublin South-Central and Gino Kenny in Dublin Mid-West.

He ruined rural Ireland, ” he said, adding that the “great people of Dublin took him out of it.”Speaking to RTÉ Radio One, Mr Collins apologised for his remarks.“I usually play the ball and not the man or woman in politics, that is my style,” he said.“It wasn’t probably good enough and I do apologise for that type of word - that’s not me.”Mr Collins said he “had very little drink” taken but “was totally exhausted” after “a hard three weeks”.The slur was “over the top” and made “in the heat of the moment” after speaking to voters who were “absolutely furious” with decisions made in Dublin against the interests of the people of rural Ireland, he said.“They were angered and maybe I was a bit wound up ... I give an apology for the word, but I certainly don’t give an apology for what has happened to rural Ireland and for me to stand up on behalf of those people,” he added.Mr Ross said he accepted the apology and understood “as well as anyone else” the “very colourful language in political life” that can be used “in the heat of battle”.“I saw the tape, and I saw how excited he was and probably tired as well in the heat of victory and of course I accept his apology,” he said.“He has withdrawn it. I acknowledge his admission it was wrong.”Mr Ross defended his clampdown on drink-driving during his time in office, adding that it had been used by some as an attack on rural Ireland.But, he said, the statistics show a majority of road deaths happen in rural Ireland and the declining number of deaths showed the road safety measures he introduced “saves lives in rural Ireland”.Mr Collins said “God only knows what causes deaths on our roads” and that the drink-driving legislation was “never rural proofed”, but introduced without any public transport provision.The re-elected TD has had a high profile as a member of the Rural Independents grouping in the Dáil from organising buses to take patients to Belfast for cataract procedures.When the Taoiseach Leo Varadkar criticised fellow Independent TD Noel Grealish over his claims that African migrants were “sponging off the system”, Mr Collins defended his right to raise the issue.

Photograph: Alan Betson.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has said the likelihood is that he will be the leader of the Opposition in the new Dáil but if Fine Gael is needed to provide political stability, his party is “willing to talk to other parties about that”. Mr Varadkar said “anything is possible” in the coming weeks, “including a second election”. However, Mr Varadkar said a second general election was not an outcome he thinks would be “good for the country”. The Taoiseach was speaking to reporters on Wednesday morning, after addressing the European Financial Forum in Dublin Castle. “One thing I didn’t have the opportunity to do as Taoiseach was to modernise and reform my party because I was very busy with the work of Government and work of State so I relish the opportunity to do that.”The Fine Gael leader said Sinn Féin had emerged as the largest party and so “responsibility now falls on them to build a coalition”. “We were defeated in this election, there’s no point in trying to dress that up in any way. It may have been a tight finish but we were defeated so that means that people are saying to us Fine Gael should go into Opposition and we’re absolutely willing to do that,” Mr Varadkar said. Mr Varadkar said he had not been involved in “any talks” about a Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Green coalition. “Sinn Féin have emerged as largest party, at least in terms of votes,” he said. “It is their responsibility now to try and keep those remarkable promises they made to the Irish people which got them so many votes and that means the onus is on them now to form a government, either with left wing parties or with Fianna Fail and to get Dáil approval for a republican socialist programme for Government. “If they fail, then obviously we’ll consider matters then. That’s where things stand now.”The Taoiseach also said Fine Gael founded the Irish State and claimed Sinn Féin had “a fake history”. “In terms of what may happen later on in this process, in the next couple of weeks, Fine Gael, my party is the party of the founding of the State...There’s another party that was founded in 1971 called Sinn Féin which has a fake history that says otherwise, but we’re the ones who founded the State, we’re the ones who established institutions, we’re the ones who made this country a Republic. “We will stand by the State and the Republic and if we’re needed in order to give the country political stability with governance, well then we’re willing to talk to other parties about that.”Addressing the European Financial Forum, Mr Varadkar said guests had arrived at “a historic time in our country’s history, only days after a general election, which has transformed our political landscape here in Ireland”. “Saturday was a day of reckoning for all political parties and now in the days and weeks ahead there’s an obligation on all of us to show that we can provide leadership, political stability and economic security and work together to build a better future for all of our people. I believe we can and I believe we will,” he said. “The political centre in Ireland has been shaken, it’s diminished but it has held, it still represents the views of the majority of people and the majority of representatives in our new parliament, Dáil Éireann. The dark future, the Second Coming prophesied by WB Yeats, has not yet come to pass.”Sinn Féin is meeting with a number of smaller parties as it launches exploratory negotiations in an attempt to a form a government.The party’s chief negotiator in attempts to form an administration, Pearse Doherty, said it has “reached out” to the Greens, Solidarity-People Before Profit, Social Democrats and Labour. “Obviously our first port of call is to talk to those parties where we would have a common platform, to tease out with the possibility of putting together a government for change,” he told Newstalk.The best news and analysis from the campaign trail Full results and counts for the 39 election constituencies.

Photograph: Jean-Francois BadiasAPBoris Johnson’s suggestion that the UK could be prepared to accept an Australian-style relationship with the EU without a formal trade deal has “surprised” Brussels. European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen pointed out that even Australia wants a better trading relationship with the bloc than the one it currently has.She said the UK and EU should be “way more ambitious” about reaching a full trade deal.In a speech setting out the UK’s negotiating objectives, the British prime minister said the question was whether to seek a Canadian-style deal or an Australian-style relationship, “and I have no doubt that in either case the UK will prosper”.But speaking in the European Parliament, Ms von der Leyen said both models fell short of a deal which would meet the goals of allowing trade without tariffs and quotas.That aim, set out in the political declaration, would require a “level playing field” with both sides guaranteeing “fair competition and the protection of social, environmental and consumer standards”.“We are ready to discuss all different models of trade agreement. But all these models, whatever you choose, have one thing in common — they all come not only with rights but also with obligations for both sides.”The Canada deal eliminates most, but not all, tariffs and quotas and “we still have our standards that have to be respected”, she said.Ms von der Leyen added: “Honestly, I was a little bit surprised to hear the prime minister of the United Kingdom speak about the Australian model.“Australia, without any doubt, is a strong and a like-minded partner. But the European Union does not have a trade agreement with Australia.“We are currently trading on WTO terms and, if this is the British choice, well, we are fine with that, without any question.”But the EU was trying to negotiate a trade deal with Australia to end the current situation.“Of course the UK can decide to settle for less, but I personally believe that we should be way more ambitious,” she said.Javid plansMs von der Leyen’s speech in Strasbourg came as the UK government set out further details of its plans for January 1st, 2021 after the Brexit transition period expires.Chancellor Sajid Javid said the government will aim to conclude a full range of equivalence assessments by June 2020 – allowing the UK and EU to respect each other’s rules.But he said the UK would also have the freedom to erge and regulate in a different way from the rules set in Brussels.Writing in City AM, he said: “Each side will only grant equivalence if it believes the other’s regulations are compatible.“But compatible does not mean identical, and both the UK and the EU have at different times recognised the importance of focusing on regulatory outcomes.“We will no longer be rule-takers, but we remain committed to the highest international standards of financial regulation and to shaping global rule-making.”But Brussels’ chief negotiator Michel Barnier said: “I would like to take this opportunity to make it clear to certain people in the United Kingdom bearing authority that they should not kid themselves about this – there will not be general, open-ended, ongoing equivalence in financial services.”The EU would “retain a free hand to take our own decisions”.Senior cabinet minister Michael Gove confirmed on Monday that goods coming to Britain from the EU will face import controls from January 1st.The British Retail Consortium said the government would have to move fast to get infrastructure in place for the start of 2021, warning that without adequate preparations the availability of goods on shelves would be disrupted, with fresh fruit and vegetables especially vulnerable.Mr Barnier told MEPs it would not be “business as usual” after January 1st.“Come what may, on January 1st we will be imposing checks on all products entering the single market, just as we do to every other third country in the world,” he said. – PA"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons february 2020","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2019 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178.New Hampshire primary 2020: Bernie Sanders beats Pete Buttigieg in narrow results - live updatesPolitics latest news: Boris Johnson hints at potential review of \u0026#39imbalanced\u0026#39 extradition treaty with USDuchess of Cornwall: We must break the \u0026#39taboo\u0026#39  around domestic violence Man, 52, charged with murder of journalist Lyra McKeeComment: Nixon thrashed the Democrats\u0026#39 last hard-Left candidate.

Mr Deripaska has denied any wrongdoing.In an interview with the  last month, Mr Soriano, 52, insisted that he had never received the letter, and claimed that he was the victim of a witch hunt against him organised by “dark and hidden forces.”But senior congressional officials working on the committee’s investigation are mystified that he did not receive the letter requesting him to take part in a voluntary interview.According to a senior US congressional official, lawyers acting for Mr Soriano contacted the committee directly to discuss its contents within days of it being sent from Washington, a move US officials described as “unusual”.Moreover the bi-partisan committee of US senators remains keen to interview Mr Soriano prior to publication of its report into Russian meddling in the American political system which is due to be published later this year.A senior congressional official involved with the Russian investigation told the  that they would not send the letter again as they were satisfied that Mr Soriano was now aware of its contents.The committee’s invitation to Mr Soriano to provide oral evidence still remains valid.” Apart from requesting details of any communications Mr Soriano may have had with Mr Deripaska and the former MI6 officers, it also asks him to provide any communications he may have had with Paul Manafort, the former chairman of Donald Trump’s election campaign, who was jailed in the US on fraud charges, and former UN National Security Advisor Michael Flynn.Mr Soriano insists he has not had any dealings with Mr Deripaska since 2010.A spokesman for Mr Soriano confirmed his lawyers had been in touch with the committee following media reports that he had been invited to attend a closed door interview “for clarification as to the facts.”To date Mr Soriano has not been interviewed.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"constant disinfecting empty streets reality beijing life since","story":"“To fight the epidemic together, always remember to measure your temperature, isolate, disinfect and sterilise!” This is the red propaganda banner stretched across my housing compound in Beijing, where there are constant reminders that the coronavirus outbreak lingers on, however eager authorities are to return to normal.The government is hoping to avoid a too-costly economic impact as offices and factories have now been shut for weeks, and to lend weight to their claims the outbreak is under control, even as the numbers keep ticking up – more than 45,000 cases and 1,100 dead.Here in Beijing, the capital of China is ramping up efforts as millions of migrants trickle back this week to their jobs after an extended Chinese New Year break.So after some time on the road chasing coronavirus stories, plus a mad dash to secure supplies like face masks and antimicrobial wipes – near-impossible to procure in a nation of 1.4 billion grappling with an epidemic – I’ve returned to my base in Beijing to find an even greater slew of outbreak control measures than when I left.Health checks are going strong at the airport, which now has curtained-off areas for additional screenings. Workers check the body temperatures of arriving passengers and review their health questionnaires before waving the (presumably) healthy through.All airport staff wear latex gloves and face masks – masks are now required for everyone in public places – and a pile of hazmat suits were spotted in one corner.After being cleared at the airport (no fever or cough!), I hailed a Didi, China’s answer to Uber. My driver promptly sent me a message: “The vehicle has been disinfected, you can rest assured on your ride.”Upon arriving at my housing complex, a group of men with red armbands scurried toward me, asking where I’d been.The trio then waved me over to a giant stack of paper forms on which I had to register my arrival at home along with personal details, before ushering me through the main gate, plastered with tons of virus announcements.To my left were giant red banners warning about the virus. In the lift, decorated with a list of nearby health clinics along with smears of dried disinfectant liquid from hourly cleanings, I discovered someone had swiped the free box of tissues – meant to be an additional protective measure when pushing the floor buttons.At my door, I was greeted with yet more virus notices about reporting recent travel and self-quarantine rules – anywhere from three to 14 days, depending where you’ve been.To be allowed back out of the complex as I needed groceries, I had to register for a special entry-exit permit – a laminated slip of paper – which required arming myself with what felt like a pound of paper to prove I was indeed a resident of the building.Packages and takeaway deliveries are being left in designated locations for pickup. It seems silly to be bothered about gathering your own boxes, but one of the greatest conveniences in China has been fast delivery of nearly anything from avocados to lavatory paper.Some people even time food orders to arrive during the few minutes a train pulls into a station before setting off again. But all that’s a mere memory now, as people try to minimise human contact over virus worries.Housing compounds across the city have instituted these measures in recent days to try and curb outside visitors and halt disease spread.Down the street, one apartment complex has even put up a ‘disinfecting’ tent at the entrance, which houses a table with hand gel.It’s unclear how effective any of this will be in curtailing infections in Beijing, a city of more than 20 million, where experts anticipate more to fall ill beyond the 350 already confirmed.Some of it feels like a box-ticking exercise – after being forced to get that ‘permit,’ the guards have given me no further trouble as I come in and out for errands, though they do stop me both ways to check my temperature.Or perhaps they’ve started to recognise all residents – even with face masks on. Still, I’ve taken to bringing along my passport, a copy of my lease, and keys to a friend’s place, just in case they fail to let me back in.While some offices and factories are opening up again, the normally heaving city streets remain empty and eerie, amplifying echoes from loudspeakers that broadcast reminders on loop: “Wear a face mask! Wash your hands!”For those who want to go the extra mile, shops are now carrying giant plastic spray bottles that can be filled with disinfectant to hose down anything, anywhere.Since the virus outbreak began, I’ve gotten used to my own daily routine of wiping down my phone – a germ bomb – and spraying down my bag.And I’ve been quite enjoying going incognito – face masks can be a bit uncomfortable, but they thwart the facial recognition technology deployed in China.So despite some movement restrictions, even to get home, I’m actually quite relieved it appears I have a bit of privacy back – at least for now.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2020/02/12/TELEMMGLPICT000224580465_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqX7pHcCCmtgwidDdHSvx2cHE86QaQRwDHQBsfS7ZzE-Q.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"nixon thrashed democrats last hard left candidate should bernie","story":"Bernie Sanders appears to be following in the footsteps of George McGovernBernie Sanders\u0027 rallies are an experience not to be missed. He is feted by vast adoring crowds who are convinced that he is going to sweep all before him. At times it seems like a revivalist meeting or – and this will only mean something to students of Victorian British history – Gladstone\u0027s Midlothian campaign. The parallels are certainly there – an ageing white-haired politician written off by the experts making a stunning political comeback.Sanders is a very good speaker and he has a simple message: the economy is rigged against ordinary people and the American medical system is designed to suit the interests of the insurance and pharmaceutical industries. It\u0027s all very inspiring, so much as that, as a newly-minted US voter, I was nearly tempted to demonstrate my support in the traditional manner of putting up a lawn sign.Arguably the Democrats made a huge mistake choosing Hillary Clinton in 2016 rather than Sanders. For what it\u0027s worth, I think he would have beaten Trump last time around if he hadn\u0027t been stitched up by the Democratic National Committee. That legacy of bitterness remains even though, as things stand, the Vermont senator remains probably the most likely candidate to win the nomination.Before they pick him, though, Democrats might want to reflect on the 1972 election, the last time the Left of the party captured the nomination.George McGovern, a senator from South Dakota, appeared unstoppable, sweeping away moderates including a former vice-president, Hubert Humphrey. The parallels are uncanny. Like Sanders, McGovern adopted a radical programme including a universal national health insurance programme and a guaranteed minimum income.In 1972, swing voters felt safer with \u0026#39Tricky Dicky\u0026#39Sanders has been able to enlist some a-list celebrities to his cause – including Danny de Vito and Michael Moore. But McGovern had some famous backers, too – he even persuaded Simon and Garfunkel to re-unite at a Madison Square Garden rally.Like Sanders, McGovern was loved by young voters and he was a far more inspiring choice than the alternatives on offer – especially when Maine\u0027s Ed Muskie was nobbled in somewhat dubious circumstances.Even the Iowa fiasco a couple of weeks ago has echoes of the shambolic Democratic campaign of 1972 which saw the party dump vice-presidential candidate Tom Eagleton after it emerged that he had undergone electroshock treatment for depression.McGovern should, of course, have surfed the tidal wave of grassroots support into the Oval Office, especially given that he was running against a isive Republican president in Richard Nixon who, to put it mildly, was not averse to a bit of political skulduggery (the similarities between then and now do not pertain solely to the Democrats).However, it didn\u0027t quite turn out like that. Some establishment Democrats backed Nixon and swing voters felt safer with Tricky Dicky. McGovern was crushed, even losing his own state. Only Massachusetts and Washington DC backed him. In 2020 the Democrats at least have an array of rather more impressive candidates than in 1972. Pete Buttigieg is drawing large crowds and, despite being dismissed by the left as Wall Street Pete, does seem to have a bit of the star quality any successful candidate needs. Amy Klobuchar\u0027s campaign is getting stronger by the day and, unlike Hillary Clinton, she gives the impression that she wants the job and is willing to work hard to get it.So Democrats should think long and hard before casting their votes over the next few months.

I am not sure if they were trolling me but both (not being a party to my pledge) in particular asked me to buy these items for them.Okay, I also bought myself a vintage shirt, non-plastic food covers to replace cling film with and cotton face pads to cleanse the face without the need for additional products.\u0026nbspSharing the full story, not just the headlinesWhy I’m changing my spending habits to help save the planetApart from the vintage shirt these latter purchases are also part of my new outlook on the things I consume: considering materials used in production the use they have and what happens once they become waste.From trying my best to avoid buying lunch wrapped in plastic to opting for plastic free cosmetics, I am trying to progressively reduce my waste.My phone is 20 months old and previously that would mean I would be ready to buy the new shiny phone with the improved camera. Instead I opted to renew my sim-only contract and stick with the handset I have as it’s functioning perfectly well.\u0026nbspAt the weekend I chose to replace the broken pipe for my 12-year-old vacuum cleaner rather than buy a whole new machine. I never knew that Dyson sells parts for even their older models, which came in very handy.Overall, I am changing my approach to things I own and may or may not need to buy, which is reducing my eco anxiety and saving me money.Created with Sketch.Plastic waste across the world: in pictures Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A father and son on a makeshift boat made from styrofoam paddle through a garbage filled river as they collect plastic bottles that they can sell in junkshops in Manila.

This is also why I am keeping a close eye on the experience of all my fellow pledgers. How can I avoid using plastic further? Can I plan my next holiday by train travel? What local produce can I opt for instead of fruit flown in from thousands of miles away? Can I start growing my own parsley and spring onion (my parents have an annual supply of potatoes from their allotment, maybe I have learnt a thing or two from them)?Modern day consumerism (i.e. capitalism) fuels our desire to have more and more. We are somehow convinced we need all this stuff. The planet is at the desperate point where we need to convince ourselves that we actually do not.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It\u0026nbspsaid it expects to invest more in low carbon businesses and less in oil and gas over time.\u0026nbspHowever, the company will continue to increase its production of fossil fuels over the next decade, while aiming to reduce the carbon intensity of the energy it supplies. That means BP\u0026nbspwill likely still have to offset hundreds of millions of tonnes of emissions each year through schemes such as tree planting. BP has not provided any details about how it will achieve this.“BP is vague on the details of its plan, but it should not rely on using carbon offsetting schemes as a licence to continue polluting,” said\u0026nbspOxfam’s climate policy advisor Kiri Hanks.\u0026nbsp”Poorer countries should not be bribed to grow forests instead of food to enable business as usual in rich nations.”Murray Worthy at Global Witness, an anti-corruption and environmental campaign group, dismissed BP’s announcement.“There is nothing ambitious about a plan that is simply not credible,” he said.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Ethiopia recently planted a reported 350 million trees in a single day Morocco has undertaken the most ambitious solar power scheme in the world, recently completing a solar plant the size of San FranciscoElectric cars are taking off as a viable alternative to fossil fuel burning vehicles and major cities across the world are adding charging points to accomodateCities around the world are embracing cycling too, as a clean (and healthy) mode of transport. The Netherlands continues to lead the way with bikes far outnumbering peopleCycling infrastructure is taking over cities the world over, in the hope of reducing society\u0027s dependency on polluting vehiclesDespite positive steps being taken, humans continue to have a wildly adverse effect on the climate. There have been numerous major oil spills this decade, the most notable being the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010More recently, large swathes of the Amazon rainforest were set alight by people to clear land for agricultureThis decade may have seen horrors but it has led to an understanding that the next decade must see change if human life is to continueBP said it will reach net zero emissions by reducing the 55 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent that it emits each year, and the 360 million tonnes associated with oil and gas it sells. It\u0026nbspsaid it expects to invest more in low carbon businesses and less in oil and gas over time.\u0026nbspHowever, the company will continue to increase its production of fossil fuels over the next decade, while aiming to reduce the carbon intensity of the energy it supplies. That means BP\u0026nbspwill likely still have to offset hundreds of millions of tonnes of emissions each year through schemes such as tree planting. BP has not provided any details about how it will achieve this.“BP is vague on the details of its plan, but it should not rely on using carbon offsetting schemes as a licence to continue polluting,” said\u0026nbspOxfam’s climate policy advisor Kiri Hanks.\u0026nbsp”Poorer countries should not be bribed to grow forests instead of food to enable business as usual in rich nations.”Murray Worthy at Global Witness, an anti-corruption and environmental campaign group, dismissed BP’s announcement.“There is nothing ambitious about a plan that is simply not credible,” he said.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Of these payments, 27 per cent were for mistaken switches and 73 per cent were for late credit balance refunds.Kwasi Kwarteng, the minister for energy and clean growth,\u0026nbspsaid: “We’ve made it easier than ever for consumers to shop around and record numbers are now switching suppliers to save on their bills.“These tough new standards will ensure switching is as smooth as possible and consumers are always protected.”David Pilling, head of policy and public affairs at the Energy Ombudsman, added: “Switching is now second only to billing as a source of complaints that we handle, so it’s clear that for too many people the process of changing supplier doesn’t go as smoothly as it should.“The introduction of automatic compensation is a welcome intervention by the regulator. It offers consumers access to immediate redress and gives suppliers a financial incentive to get switches right first time.“At the same time we think it’s vital that, as well as paying compensation, energy suppliers look at what went wrong with the switch and make improvements to their processes. It’s in this root-cause analysis and proactive work to raise standards across the sector that we see our role as the ombudsman.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

And in addition to the strange holes, it also has a mysterious bright spot on its surface.It is also quite large: the rock, known as Pallas, is the third-biggest object in the asteroid belt, and about a seventh the size of our moon. It was first discovered in 1802, but many of its details have remained mysterious.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesNow scientists have revealed the holey surface of the asteroid in images for the first time – and suggest they could also help solve some of the other mysteries about the object.Over the centuries since it was discovered, astronomers noted that Pallas takes a strange route through the asteroid belt, following a tilted journey when compared with most of the other objects that surround it.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas flom fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telelscope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

As it moves around the Sun, it has to smash its way through to take its lonely course. Because it comes at an angle, the collisions are especially damaging, leaving the cratered service that has now been revealed in the images.“Pallas’\u0026nbsporbit implies very high-velocity impacts,” says\u0026nbspMichaël\u0026nbspMarsset, the paper’s lead author said in a statement.Asteroid that ended dinosaurs acidified ocean causing mass extinction“From these images, we can now say that\u0026nbspPallas\u0026nbspis the most cratered object that we know of in the asteroid belt. It’s like discovering a new world.”The scientists also found one huge crater on the object\u0027s surface, which is thought to be about 400 kilometres wide. Research suggests that such a large basin would probably have been caused about 1.7 billion years ago, when Pallas was thought to be hit by an object between 20 and 40 kilometres wide, which would have thrown the pieces out into space.As well as the huge variety of holes, Pallas also has a bright spot in its surface, researchers discovered while examining the object.Scientists don\u0027t know where that is coming from. The most likely theory is that it is a huge chunk of salt, which may have been exposed after one of its collisions.People have proposed missions to Pallas with very small, cheap satellites, Marsset says. I don\u0027t know if they would happen, but they could tell us more about the surface of Pallas and the origin of the bright spot.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Over 199 episodes, the series followed Ironside and his team in his role as consultant to the Police Department as they sorted out the bad guys of the City by the Bay.    Ian Rankin says he has never watched any of the television adaptions of his famously brooding, heavy drinking, loner detective because he didn’t want the actors’ faces replacing how he envisaged Rebus in his head. Two actors have played Rebus on screen, John Hannah and Ken Stott. Hannah gives the role his best but was probably too young and lacked the cynical gravitas that Stott gave to Rebus. With similar roles in The Vice and Messiah giving Stott an identifiable acting persona, he perhaps has the same problem as Humphrey Bogart being too much like Bogart to play the definitive Philip Marlowe, but in the absence of any other candidates, Stott is just fine. Rankin’s central theme of the Jekyll and Hyde dichotomy of Scotland’s capital city remains intact, and as in the novels, the real star of the show is of course, Edinburgh itself in all its historic beauty, showing the dark underbelly of the city behind the chintz curtains. 320 18. Life on Mars (2006-07)Nostalgia might not be what it used to be, but the biggest mystery with Life on Mars is why it took someone so long to come up with this inspired paean to the pop culture and TV cop shows of the 1970s. Throw in the fish-out-of-water time travel motif and the tongue in cheek non-PC scripts and characters, and its not hard to see why the series struck a chord with audiences.    Like many of his ilk, dedicated near-genius DCI John Luther (a brilliant Idris Elba) is a tormented soul, struggling with his own inner demons, hugely affected by the stomach churning crimes he investigates. Luther is so obsessive that he will do anything to get his man (or woman, in the case of his nemesis, the psychopathic scientist Alice Morgan (Ruth Wilson) Both cerebral and heart pumping, Luther was created by Neil Cross and has spawned American and Russian versions.Gillian Anderson is the deliberate, dedicated senior detective on the trail of an equally meticulous serial killer in this controversial drama filmed and set in Northern Ireland. The Fall survived accusations of misogyny and voyeurism to lift a Bafta for best television drama and keep viewers hooked for three series, but remains a troubling, unsettling experience for many.620 15. Cagney and Lacey (1981-88)The cop show that more than any other blew the stereotypical image of female police officers out of the water, and challenged the sexist attitudes of many executives in the television industry. Tyne Daly and Sharon Gless won the hearts of millions of viewers, and six Emmys between them, as two dedicated New York police officers who happened to be women with normal lives and challenges like everyone else. The bond between the two characters was unbreakable despite leading entirely different lives (Lacey was married with a family and supportive husband, Cagney drifted from relationship to relationship). A game changer in many ways, Cagney and Lacey explored issues such as rape, abortion and Cagney’s alcoholism head on.720 14. Between the Lines (1992-94)Set in the politan Police Complaints Investigation Bureau, the Bafta winning Between the Lines follows ambitious Chief Superintendent Tony Clarke and his team as they investigate corruption within the police force. Between the Lines drew praise for the way it tackled topical issues of the day as it attempted to address the age old moral dilemma, quis custodiet ipsos custodes – who will guard the guards themselves?The cop show that more than any other blurred the lines between the good guys and the bad guys. Rogue cop Vic Mackey leads the elite “strike force” of LA detectives who routinely break the law to keep the streets safe, but also to feather their own nest. There are subplots aplenty, and Mackey’s downfall plays out almost like a Shakespearean tragedy.Set in the fictional northern town of Newtown, Z Cars broke new ground in police drama shows, challenging the homely predictability of the likes of Dixon of Dock Green. Devised by Allan Prior and Troy Kennedy Martin, the series centred on not just one central protagonist, but rather several police officers both uniformed and plain clothed. Z Cars brought some iconic characters into the nation’s living rooms such as detective Charlie Barlow, PC “Fancy” Smith and desk sergeant Bert Lynch. The police officers themselves were portrayed warts and all, with gritty subject matter, including domestic abuse at the hands of a police officer, at the heart of the storylines. The actors became household names with the iconic theme tune whistled on everyone’s lips, and of course there were the “Z” cars themselves, the American-style Ford Zephyr and Zodiac patrol cars.   If Cagney and Lacey blazed the trail for female cops, then the first series of Prime Suspect in particular indicated a seismic shift in the perception of, and the attitudes towards, the female police officer. Helen Mirren is outstanding as DCI Jane Tennison who heads a murder squad hunting a sadistic serial killer, but has to overcome opposition and resentment from her team as well as the institutionalised sexism of the police department itself. Subsequent series concentrated more on Tennison’s inner demons as she began to rely on alcohol to help her cope with the pressures of the job.  This Danish police procedural and prime example of Scandinavian noir attracted criticism for its violence against women. It did, however, become an international success particularly in the UK. Viewers were gripped by the formula that of each episode reflecting 24 hours in the same murder case, and by the cold-fish female detective protagonist Sarah Lund, while developing an almost fetishist fascination with her knitwear. The Killing paved the way for other subtitled European crime dramas and equally popular and acclaimed entries such as The Bridge and Borgen quickly followed.     1220 9. Law and Order (1990-2010)Filmed in New City with a two-pronged approach of the investigation of a crime and arrest of a suspect, followed by the suspect’s trial, Law and Order introduced one of the great small-screen detectives, recovering alcoholic Lennie Briscoe. (Jerry Orbach). The show’s boast was that many of its subject matters were “ripped from the headlines” and it was this approach that gave it a compelling topical feel and made it the longest-running American crime series and the benchmark for police procedurals.1320 8. Line of Duty (2012- )An outstanding ratings success for BBC2, Jed Mercurio’s masterful police corruption thriller gripped viewers from the very beginning and kept them guessing until the explosive climax to the third series. The bold, serpentine and gripping storylines provided the exemplary cast with parts of a lifetime, with the most outstanding feature of Line of Duty undoubtedly the lengthy interrogation scenes as the tension was racked up notch by notch. After Bing Crosby turned the role down, Peter Falk became synonymous with the cigar smoking, dishevelled police lieutenant in a shabby raincoat, winning four Emmys and a Golden Globe. Referred to as a “howcatchem” by its’ creators, Columbo deviated from the traditional whodunit in that the audience and, it seemed, Columbo himself, knew the identity of the murderer from the start. Half the fun of the show was watching the murderer (frequently an A- or B-list guest star) underestimate the seemingly bumbling, absent-minded detective while he baited the trap to snare them. Oh, and just one more thing, as Columbo himself might say: although Columbo routinely spoke of his wife, she was never seen in any episode, but the character was later given her own, short-lived, spin-off show, Mrs Columbo. It has been compared to the works of Dickens and Dostoevsky and lauded as the greatest television programme ever. But the triumph of The Wire is how it tells the story of the decaying city of Baltimore through the lives of the police, drug dealers, politicians, children and the dispossessed, making no moral judgements between good and bad in a predominately grey world. The Wire may not be the greatest television programme ever, but its realism and authenticity can never be in doubt. In 2005, members of a drugs gang claimed they had studied The Wire in order to learn about the latest police surveillance techniques, surely the ultimate example of life imitating art. Aping its antecedent Hill Street Blues’ cinema verite style, multi award winning NYPD Blue was a natural progression for co-creator Steven Bochno, who along with David Milsch came up with even grittier storylines, atmospheric New York locations and warts ’n all characters to create a hugely compelling and influential cop show. But let’s be honest, despite a terrific ensemble cast, Dennis Franz as scenery-chewing recovering alcoholic detective Andy Sipowicz, was virtually the whole show, appearing in all 261 episodes and in the process searing his psyche in viewers’ minds.1720 4. Homicide: Life on the Street (1993-98)Baltimore native Barry Levinson was a natural fit as executive producer of this ultra-realistic police procedural, based on The Wire creator David Simon’s book chronicling his experiences following homicide detectives at work in the so-called “City of Firsts”. From the very first episode Life on the Street succeeded in dispelling the myths and stereotypes about the television cop, showing that murder and violence were just a routine parts of the job. Indeed the murder of a schoolgirl in that first episode was never solved. Aficionados rate this show even better than The Wire. Some have called Homicide: Life on the Street the missing link between Hill Street Blues and The Wire. Beg, borrow or steal the box set and find out why.   Such is the renown of the celebrated television adaptation of Colin Dexter’s novels featuring the enigmatic real-ale swilling, arts loving, crossword buff detective, that there’s very little left to say apart from it’s basically a brilliant variation on the classic English whodunit, Kevin Whately’s Lewis is to John Thaw’s Morse as Dr Watson was to Sherlock Holmes, and Thaw is simply wonderful.It has become so caricatured and parodied in recent years that it’s easy to overlook the fact that The Sweeney made Z Cars look as antiquated as the former did Dixon of Dock Green a decade earlier. Created by Ian Kennedy Martin, brother of Z Cars co-creator Troy, The Sweeney was shot in 16mm film and that, along with extensive location shooting, gave it a more cinematic look than other studio-bound rivals. Created by Steven Bochco and Michael Kozoll and still celebrated, still hugely influential, and still the cop show to which almost everything that has come since owes a huge debt. From Mike Post’s iconic theme and the innovative cinema vèritè-evoking handheld camera, to the brilliant ensemble cast creating beloved characters and dramatic storylines in the urban sprawl of an unnamed US city, Hill Street Blues pioneered a new wave of cop shows. Ironically, it never gained huge audience ratings, but garnered a grand total of 98 Emmy nominations. Groundbreaking, thought provoking, emotional and funny, Hill Street Blues stands tall in the canon of truly great television.Launched to much fanfare as a television movie and boasting a killer theme tune from Quincy Jones, Ironside starred Raymond Burr, who was still hot after his stint as television’s Perry Mason, as San Francisco Chief of Police Robert T Ironside, who is confined to a wheelchair after an attempted assassination. Over 199 episodes, the series followed Ironside and his team in his role as consultant to the Police Department as they sorted out the bad guys of the City by the Bay.    Ian Rankin says he has never watched any of the television adaptions of his famously brooding, heavy drinking, loner detective because he didn’t want the actors’ faces replacing how he envisaged Rebus in his head. Two actors have played Rebus on screen, John Hannah and Ken Stott. Hannah gives the role his best but was probably too young and lacked the cynical gravitas that Stott gave to Rebus. With similar roles in The Vice and Messiah giving Stott an identifiable acting persona, he perhaps has the same problem as Humphrey Bogart being too much like Bogart to play the definitive Philip Marlowe, but in the absence of any other candidates, Stott is just fine. Rankin’s central theme of the Jekyll and Hyde dichotomy of Scotland’s capital city remains intact, and as in the novels, the real star of the show is of course, Edinburgh itself in all its historic beauty, showing the dark underbelly of the city behind the chintz curtains. 320 18. Life on Mars (2006-07)Nostalgia might not be what it used to be, but the biggest mystery with Life on Mars is why it took someone so long to come up with this inspired paean to the pop culture and TV cop shows of the 1970s. Throw in the fish-out-of-water time travel motif and the tongue in cheek non-PC scripts and characters, and its not hard to see why the series struck a chord with audiences.    Like many of his ilk, dedicated near-genius DCI John Luther (a brilliant Idris Elba) is a tormented soul, struggling with his own inner demons, hugely affected by the stomach churning crimes he investigates. Luther is so obsessive that he will do anything to get his man (or woman, in the case of his nemesis, the psychopathic scientist Alice Morgan (Ruth Wilson) Both cerebral and heart pumping, Luther was created by Neil Cross and has spawned American and Russian versions.Gillian Anderson is the deliberate, dedicated senior detective on the trail of an equally meticulous serial killer in this controversial drama filmed and set in Northern Ireland. The Fall survived accusations of misogyny and voyeurism to lift a Bafta for best television drama and keep viewers hooked for three series, but remains a troubling, unsettling experience for many.620 15. Cagney and Lacey (1981-88)The cop show that more than any other blew the stereotypical image of female police officers out of the water, and challenged the sexist attitudes of many executives in the television industry. Tyne Daly and Sharon Gless won the hearts of millions of viewers, and six Emmys between them, as two dedicated New York police officers who happened to be women with normal lives and challenges like everyone else. The bond between the two characters was unbreakable despite leading entirely different lives (Lacey was married with a family and supportive husband, Cagney drifted from relationship to relationship). A game changer in many ways, Cagney and Lacey explored issues such as rape, abortion and Cagney’s alcoholism head on.720 14. Between the Lines (1992-94)Set in the politan Police Complaints Investigation Bureau, the Bafta winning Between the Lines follows ambitious Chief Superintendent Tony Clarke and his team as they investigate corruption within the police force. Between the Lines drew praise for the way it tackled topical issues of the day as it attempted to address the age old moral dilemma, quis custodiet ipsos custodes – who will guard the guards themselves?The cop show that more than any other blurred the lines between the good guys and the bad guys. Rogue cop Vic Mackey leads the elite “strike force” of LA detectives who routinely break the law to keep the streets safe, but also to feather their own nest. There are subplots aplenty, and Mackey’s downfall plays out almost like a Shakespearean tragedy.Set in the fictional northern town of Newtown, Z Cars broke new ground in police drama shows, challenging the homely predictability of the likes of Dixon of Dock Green. Devised by Allan Prior and Troy Kennedy Martin, the series centred on not just one central protagonist, but rather several police officers both uniformed and plain clothed. Z Cars brought some iconic characters into the nation’s living rooms such as detective Charlie Barlow, PC “Fancy” Smith and desk sergeant Bert Lynch. The police officers themselves were portrayed warts and all, with gritty subject matter, including domestic abuse at the hands of a police officer, at the heart of the storylines. The actors became household names with the iconic theme tune whistled on everyone’s lips, and of course there were the “Z” cars themselves, the American-style Ford Zephyr and Zodiac patrol cars.   If Cagney and Lacey blazed the trail for female cops, then the first series of Prime Suspect in particular indicated a seismic shift in the perception of, and the attitudes towards, the female police officer. Helen Mirren is outstanding as DCI Jane Tennison who heads a murder squad hunting a sadistic serial killer, but has to overcome opposition and resentment from her team as well as the institutionalised sexism of the police department itself. Subsequent series concentrated more on Tennison’s inner demons as she began to rely on alcohol to help her cope with the pressures of the job.  This Danish police procedural and prime example of Scandinavian noir attracted criticism for its violence against women. It did, however, become an international success particularly in the UK. Viewers were gripped by the formula that of each episode reflecting 24 hours in the same murder case, and by the cold-fish female detective protagonist Sarah Lund, while developing an almost fetishist fascination with her knitwear. The Killing paved the way for other subtitled European crime dramas and equally popular and acclaimed entries such as The Bridge and Borgen quickly followed.     1220 9. Law and Order (1990-2010)Filmed in New City with a two-pronged approach of the investigation of a crime and arrest of a suspect, followed by the suspect’s trial, Law and Order introduced one of the great small-screen detectives, recovering alcoholic Lennie Briscoe. (Jerry Orbach). The show’s boast was that many of its subject matters were “ripped from the headlines” and it was this approach that gave it a compelling topical feel and made it the longest-running American crime series and the benchmark for police procedurals.1320 8. Line of Duty (2012- )An outstanding ratings success for BBC2, Jed Mercurio’s masterful police corruption thriller gripped viewers from the very beginning and kept them guessing until the explosive climax to the third series. The bold, serpentine and gripping storylines provided the exemplary cast with parts of a lifetime, with the most outstanding feature of Line of Duty undoubtedly the lengthy interrogation scenes as the tension was racked up notch by notch. After Bing Crosby turned the role down, Peter Falk became synonymous with the cigar smoking, dishevelled police lieutenant in a shabby raincoat, winning four Emmys and a Golden Globe. Referred to as a “howcatchem” by its’ creators, Columbo deviated from the traditional whodunit in that the audience and, it seemed, Columbo himself, knew the identity of the murderer from the start. Half the fun of the show was watching the murderer (frequently an A- or B-list guest star) underestimate the seemingly bumbling, absent-minded detective while he baited the trap to snare them. Oh, and just one more thing, as Columbo himself might say: although Columbo routinely spoke of his wife, she was never seen in any episode, but the character was later given her own, short-lived, spin-off show, Mrs Columbo. It has been compared to the works of Dickens and Dostoevsky and lauded as the greatest television programme ever. But the triumph of The Wire is how it tells the story of the decaying city of Baltimore through the lives of the police, drug dealers, politicians, children and the dispossessed, making no moral judgements between good and bad in a predominately grey world. The Wire may not be the greatest television programme ever, but its realism and authenticity can never be in doubt. In 2005, members of a drugs gang claimed they had studied The Wire in order to learn about the latest police surveillance techniques, surely the ultimate example of life imitating art. Aping its antecedent Hill Street Blues’ cinema verite style, multi award winning NYPD Blue was a natural progression for co-creator Steven Bochno, who along with David Milsch came up with even grittier storylines, atmospheric New York locations and warts ’n all characters to create a hugely compelling and influential cop show. But let’s be honest, despite a terrific ensemble cast, Dennis Franz as scenery-chewing recovering alcoholic detective Andy Sipowicz, was virtually the whole show, appearing in all 261 episodes and in the process searing his psyche in viewers’ minds.1720 4.

Since then, the government has been consulting with tech firms, charities and other groups in an attempt to refine those suggestions.In the latest\u0026nbspannouncement, ministers said that the new regulation would be introduced with a view to protecting free speech.“Freedom of expression, and the role of a free press, is vital to a healthy democracy,” wrote the culture secretary, Dame Nicky Morgan, and the home secretary,\u0026nbspPriti Patel. “We will ensure that there are safeguards in the legislation, so companies and the new regulator have a clear responsibility to protect users’ rights online, including freedom of expression and the need to maintain a vibrant and erse public square.”This is life under the longest internet shutdown in historyThe government said it had chosen Ofcom as the new regulator because of its history, which has in the past only extended to broadcasting, telecoms and other related industries, and added that the regulator\u0026nbspis the “best fit” because it wants one “with a proven track record of experience, expertise and credibility”.“With Ofcom at the helm of a proportionate and strong regulatory regime, we have an incredible opportunity to lead the world in building a thriving digital economy, driven by groundbreaking technology, that is trusted by and protects everyone in the UK,” Dame Nicky said.“We will give the regulator the powers it needs to lead the fight for an internet that remains vibrant and open but with the protections, accountability and transparency\u0026nbsppeople deserve.”Ms Patel said: “While the internet can be used to connect people and drive innovation, we know it can also be a hiding place for criminals, including paedophiles, to cause immense harm.“It is incumbent on tech firms to balance issues of privacy and technological advances with child protection.“That’s why it is right that we have a strong regulator to ensure social media firms fulfil their vital responsibility to vulnerable users.”As the new regulatory plans were unveiled, Ofcom also announced that civil servant Dame Melanie Dawes had\u0026nbspbeen appointed as its new chief executive.Dame Melanie has been permanent secretary at the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government since 2015 and will start in early March.Ofcom’s chairman, Lord Burns, will also step down later this year after the government indicated that it wanted a chair who would be able to implement its online-harms programme in full over the next few years.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The pictured skeleton is on display at the Berlin Museum of Natural HistoryThis herbivore lived between 76-70 million years ago in the late Cretaceous period. This particular skeleton - on display at the Senckenberg museum in Germany - was found in Alberta, Canada, which is also where the first Euoplocephalus fossil was found in 1897He added: “This discovery is significant because it fills in a gap in our understanding of tyrannosaur evolution.”After analysis of its age and the shape of its skull, scientists were able to conclude the bones belonged to a unique species, standing 8ft tall with\u0026nbspridges in its upper jaw above its menacing, 7cm teeth.New ‘teenage’ T-rex bones reveal how dinosaur became a monsterJared Voris, a University of Calgary PhD student and lead author of the study, said: “Thanatotheristes can be distinguished from all other tyrannosaurs by numerous characteristics of the skull, but the most prominent are vertical ridges that run the length of the upper jaw.”The beast’s age puts it alongside only two other dinosaurs to have been found in Canada that stalked the earth between 66 and 77 million years ago – the dome-headed colepiocephale, and the horned cousin of the triceratops, xenoceratops.The likely apex predator of the era is also one of only five tyrannosaur\u0026nbspspecies to be discovered in the region, alongside Daspletosaurus, Gorgosaurus, Albertosaurus, and Tyrannosaurus.University of Calgary\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Their older supplier will pay if they did not issue a final bill in time.Mary Starks, executive director for consumers and markets at\u0026nbspOfgem, said: “More customers are switching than ever, with a record 6.4 million changing supplier in 2019. But we also know that a minority can still experience problems when they switch.“As part of our commitment to protecting consumers and enabling competition, we are introducing these new standards to give customers further peace of mind, and to challenge suppliers to get it right first time.“Going forward, we will continue working with suppliers and consumer groups to deliver our programme for faster and more reliable switching and ensure these arrangements are fit for the future.”Last year Ofgem introduced new rules requiring energy suppliers to pay out if they fail\u0026nbspto meet minimum standards around spotting and correcting mistaken switches\u0026nbspor refunding credit balances to customers.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Of these payments, 27 per cent were for mistaken switches and 73 per cent were for late credit balance refunds.Kwasi Kwarteng, the minister for energy and clean growth,\u0026nbspsaid: “We’ve made it easier than ever for consumers to shop around and record numbers are now switching suppliers to save on their bills.“These tough new standards will ensure switching is as smooth as possible and consumers are always protected.”David Pilling, head of policy and public affairs at the Energy Ombudsman, added: “Switching is now second only to billing as a source of complaints that we handle, so it’s clear that for too many people the process of changing supplier doesn’t go as smoothly as it should.“The introduction of automatic compensation is a welcome intervention by the regulator. It offers consumers access to immediate redress and gives suppliers a financial incentive to get switches right first time.“At the same time we think it’s vital that, as well as paying compensation, energy suppliers look at what went wrong with the switch and make improvements to their processes. It’s in this root-cause analysis and proactive work to raise standards across the sector that we see our role as the ombudsman.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

If this were the case, banks and other financial institutions could base themselves in the UK knowing they might not be frozen out by EU regulators one day to the next.As a result of Britain\u0027s departure from the EU, City firms will lose their automatic passporting rights to keep doing business on the continent.Created with Sketch.Brexit celebrations in Parliament Square Show all 37Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Pro-Brexit supporters celebrating in Parliament Square, after the UK left the European Union on 31 January.

In 2017, then home secretary Amber Rudd said the feature was giving terrorists a place to hide, and Facebook\u0027s plan to roll out the security feature to its other chat app continues to receive sustained opposition.But it argued in the live blog that the job of keeping those conversations secure became more important as more people joined the app.We know that the more we connect, the more we have to protect, it wrote.

It makes for a quiet end to a campaign in which he spent tens of millions of dollars and successfully vaulted himself into the national spotlight despite his paucity of political experience.Along the way, he injected some big ideas into the mainstream of Democratic debate — chief among them a universal basic income — and roused a movement of supporters big enough and enthusiastic enough to earn themselves a nickname: The Yang Gang.But in the end, it wasn’t enough to make him president. So what next?Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesNo sooner had Yang announced he was winding things up than the New York Post reported\u0026nbsp“Democratic consultants and other operatives throughout the Big Apple were buzzing” about his potential as a candidate for mayor of the nation’s largest city.Yang hasn’t yet said he’s running — but it’s never too soon to weigh up what he’d be getting into.Created with Sketch.Democratic candidates compete on the campaign trail: In pictures Show all 16Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Amy Klobuchar changes her shoes backstage after giving a speech in Exeter, New HampshireA warmly-wrapped-up dog attends an Elizabeth Warren event at Amherst Elementary School in Nashua, New HampshireLisa Olney, of Wellesley, Massachussets, demonstrates her support for Elizabeth Warren in Nashua, New HampshireJoe Biden was hoping to improve on his poor showing in Iowa in the New Hampshire primaryElizabeth Warren, renowned for giving time to supporters for selfies, works the crowd at the University of New Hampshire in DurhamBernie Sanders, who romped to victory in New Hampshire against Hillary Clinton in 2016, talks to the media in ManchesterA man holds up a sign criticising billionaires in the presidential race in front of Michael Bloomberg in Compton, Califronia.

Taken alone, the city’s population would make it the twelfth largest state in the union, with the third-largest GDP (after California and Texas). For an ambitious former tech executive whose political instincts are a blend of the idealistic and the technocratic, it’s possibly the ideal job.Assuming Yang ran for the job as a Democrat, he would have to compete in a primary against the unpopular two-term incumbent, Bill de Blasio, who also ran for the Democratic presidential nomination this year\u0026nbsp(he fared far worse than Yang, dropping out long before the primaries began).Yang would be following in the footsteps of several towering figures in local (and indeed national) history. Among them are Ed Koch, who oversaw the city during the crime wave of the 1980s, and Rudy Giuliani, now Donald Trump’s personal lawyer, who is well known for using the ‘broken windows’ policy on crime, and famously took to the streets in the aftermath of 911.But most conspicuous of all is another of this year’s Democratic presidential contenders. Michael Bloomberg succeeded Giuliani as mayor, initially as a Republican and then as an Independent he reigned for 12 years, extending the office’s term limit in order to do so.If Bloomberg’s campaign succeeds, it’ll might make the mayor’s office all the more tempting for those who, like Yang, probably still harbour dreams of being president. Then again, it’s not quite that simple.Giuliani too tried to leverage his record as mayor to win the presidency his campaign turned out to be an unmitigated (and very expensive) failure.And as his presidential campaign ramps up, Bloomberg has found himself in hot water over his mayoral record: his former enthusiastic defence of stop-and-frisk police tactics has revolted much of the Democratic base, and, with a long way to go till the nomination is settled, he will struggle to shake the issue off.So if Yang is pondering whether to run for mayor, he will have to ask himself why. If it’s because he thinks it might make him president someday, perhaps he should think twice.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Their allegations cast doubt on statements by the Israeli military (the IDF) that “it does everything it can to prevent unnecessary killings in Gaza”, a besieged strip home to two million people and one of the most densely populated places on earth.\u0026nbspAnother worry concerns the calculation of “permitted civilian casualties” or so-called collateral damage in major military operations, like 2014’s “Protective Edge”. Over 1,400 Palestinian civilians and six civilians on the Israeli side were killed during the 51-day war, according to the United Nations.\u0026nbspairstrike: ‘We had no warning’The servicemen said if the threat level against the Israeli military increases in one part of Gaza, and the operational mode and accepted level of “collateral damage” is raised, that is applied to the entirety of the Strip, regardless of the intensity of the threat in other areas, raising questions about proportionality.\u0026nbspRights groups warn these practices are driving up civilian death tolls and in specific instances may violate international law.\u0026nbspThe Israeli army\u0026nbspdeclined to comment on the specific allegations but told The Independent: “The army has a detailed organisational structure in which decisions are made.”\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspOn its website, it outlines how it mitigates casualties.\u0026nbspThe IDF has repeatedly in the past denied allegations it has committed illegal strikes.\u0026nbsp“Formally there is a ‘use by’ date\u0026nbspfor each target after which time two new sources of intel have to be found to re-incriminate it. But there are too many targets to check in comparison to the number of researchers,” said one Air Force intelligence personnel\u0026nbsp (“A”), whose identity has been concealed for security reasons.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by email“A” said targets have routinely not been checked “for sometimes more than a year”.\u0026nbsp“Expired targets are not necessarily the priority. Usually, researchers are assigned projects to find new targets. It is a hassle, they prefer to discover something new,” “A” added.\u0026nbspThe same air force intelligence member said that at “a systematic level, masses of targets are being bombed without visual check as there are not enough drones.”A second member of the air force (“B”), told The Independent this becomes a major issue during longer operations, like 2014 when for a lack of targets, the orders were to “simply keep dropping bombs” anywhere in order to “make noise”. \u0026nbspThese allegations were corroborated by other testimonies from personnel collected by Israeli organisation Breaking the Silence and handed to The Independent.Israeli advocacy groups say this shatters international assumptions that Israel, which has one of the most advanced and well-equipped militaries in the world, is engaged in “clean warfare” in Gaza that aims to mitigate casualties.\u0026nbspBreaking the Silence, a rights group made up of Israeli veterans, is so concerned about major structural problems that it has called for an external probe saying that most of the civilians killed in Gaza were “killed according to protocol”. \u0026nbsp“The common person thinks we have precise weapons, with precise intelligence led by technology that is all clean, but a e into this exposes that this is a complete misunderstanding of what is going on,” said Yehuda Shaul, BTS’s founder.\u0026nbspFor Palestinians, Trump’s peace plan offers no peace at allFour dead and a dozen injured as violence soars in wake of Trump dealWhy the Trump peace plan unveiling worked in Netanyahu’s favourThe UN said Gaza would be uninhabitable by 2020 – but it already is“We believe the problem in Gaza is systematic. It’s the orders, it’s the entire structure of the planning and execution of the operation rather than one soldier, one event, one unit. We would like to see an external Israeli civilian investigation into the rules of engagement and protocol of the IDF in Gaza.”Yael Stein, research director for Israeli rights group B’Tselem, said the Israeli army’s insistence on only conducting internal reviews is part of a “whitewashing mechanism” to reduce scrutiny from outside.\u0026nbsp“There are never any real investigations, they never investigate policy. It is Israel putting a lot of effort into creating a facade that they are investigating to make the world think that they are being thorough,” she said.\u0026nbspWe believe the problem in Gaza is systematic. It’s the orders, the entire structure of planning rather than one soldier, one unit\u0026nbspThe revelations come amid mounting pressure on Israel to change its conduct in Gaza, including a possible investigation by the International Criminal Court (ICC).Gaza has been crippled by a 13-year Israeli and Egyptian blockade first imposed after militant group Hamas violently seized control of the coastal enclave in 2007.\u0026nbspIsrael and several other countries consider Hamas a terrorist group and say the blockade is needed to keep the group from arming. The Israeli military and militants in Gaza have fought three wars since 2008.\u0026nbspThe ICC’s top prosecutor Fatou Bensouda announced in December she wants to open a probe into war crimes committed by all sides in the Palestinian Territories since the start of the 2014 war.\u0026nbspThe Israeli military, already accused by UN experts of committing possible war crimes in the Strip, vehemently denies that it has violated international law and says it does not recognise the court’s jurisdiction. Hamas is also in the ICC’s and UN’s crosshairs for its conduct, including indiscriminately firing at Israeli civilians.Among the major events likely to be examined will be the cross-border flare-ups over the last year and a half which have seen the armed wings of Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) fire hundreds of rockets at southern Israel and the Israeli army conduct thousands of bombings within the Strip.Human Rights Watch said last week that it believed that during the last major escalation in November, at least two Israeli strikes that killed 11 civilians were likely unlawful.\u0026nbspDuring a 14 November bombing that nearly wiped out an entire Palestinian family, including five children all under the age of 14, HRW found that the Israeli military “failed in their legal obligation to carefully assess the nature of their target”, to check for civilians and to ensure that they attack only combatants and military objectives.Left-leaning Israeli daily Haaretz cited defence officials saying that in this strike, which killed nine people in total, the military had again used outdated intelligence and had not conducted a prior inspection of civilian presence at the site.\u0026nbspGerry Simpson, HRW’s associate crisis and conflict director, said consequently both the Israeli strikes and Palestinian rocket fire “highlights the need for ICC scrutiny”.\u0026nbspThe Israeli army told The Independent it thought HRW’s report was “factually unfounded, deficient and biased” and “jumps to baseless legal conclusions”. The army did not directly address Haaretz’s claims.The target was corrugated iron structures in a central Gaza agricultural district, that were home to the two families of brothers Rasmi, 45, and Mohammed Abu Malhous, 40, according to relatives and neighbours.\u0026nbspJust past midnight on 14 November three air-dropped munitions pounded the area as approximately 20 members of the family were sleeping, eviscerating the homes. Nine people, including Rasmi, Mohamed, their wives and five children were killed, the youngest aged just one year old. The remaining members of the extended family said one adult and nine children were also injured, some of whom were interviewed by\u0026nbspThe Independent.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Gaza strike \u0027We had no warning\u0027 Show all 9Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.One of the children injured in the 14 November airstrike in Gaza Family members compare a photo the Israeli army tweeted of the alleged target and a photo of Ramsi who was killed in the strikeRelatives show a photo of Mohamed who they say looks nothing like the PIJ commander named as the target of the strike Relatives of the Abu Malhous family, who lost nine family members in an Israeli airstrike, search through the remains to find belongings in GazaA pair of children\u0027s jeans, is one of the few items that survived an Israeli airstrike on two homes in Deir al-Balah central GazaSatellite imagery shows before and after the strike which destroyed the homes of Rasmi and Mohamed Abu Malhous, that the IDF said was a military compoundSatellite imagery shows the structures were consistently in place since at least 2008, supporting the family\u0027s claims they had been living there for over a decade The children who survived the strike are traumatised, family members saidA family member looks at the remains of what were the homes of Rasmi and Mohamed Abu Malhous, killed alongside their wives and children in an Israeli airstrike in GazaOne of the children injured in the 14 November airstrike in Gaza Family members compare a photo the Israeli army tweeted of the alleged target and a photo of Ramsi who was killed in the strikeRelatives show a photo of Mohamed who they say looks nothing like the PIJ commander named as the target of the strike Relatives of the Abu Malhous family, who lost nine family members in an Israeli airstrike, search through the remains to find belongings in GazaA pair of children\u0027s jeans, is one of the few items that survived an Israeli airstrike on two homes in Deir al-Balah central GazaSatellite imagery shows before and after the strike which destroyed the homes of Rasmi and Mohamed Abu Malhous, that the IDF said was a military compoundSatellite imagery shows the structures were consistently in place since at least 2008, supporting the family\u0027s claims they had been living there for over a decade The children who survived the strike are traumatised, family members saidA family member looks at the remains of what were the homes of Rasmi and Mohamed Abu Malhous, killed alongside their wives and children in an Israeli airstrike in GazaLittle is left of the structures: in their place are three yawning\u0026nbspcraters. The area is flanked by open agricultural fields and just a few hundred metres away is a sprawling UN compound.\u0026nbspThe Israeli military’s Arabic spokesman at first claimed the strike had successfully killed a Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) commander he named as Rasmi Abu Malhous, but the army revised its statement, later claiming it had hit a military compound.\u0026nbspAfter conducting an internal review, the army said that it had miscategorised the shacks, adding they should have been identified as a civilian complex with “some militant activity” but gave no further information.\u0026nbspHowever, the military appeared to cycle back when speaking to The Independent this week, saying the target was identified as a “Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) military compound… used to conduct military activity”. The statement did not elaborate on the kind of activity. \u0026nbspThe army said it was first designated in June 2109 “in accordance with the relevant IDF intelligence doctrine” and claimed it had been vetted several times “lastly just days prior to its attack”.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp“During the planning and execution of the strike, the IDF expected that no civilians would be harmed by the strike,” the statement read.\u0026nbspDuring the planning and execution of the strike, the\u0026nbspIDF\u0026nbspexpected that no civilians would be harmed\u0026nbspThe Independent’s own investigation into the strike, including interviewing the family and neighbours, visiting the bomb site and examining satellite imagery of the area dating back to 2008, found evidence that appears to counter many of the claims about the military nature of the target.\u0026nbspThe Independent also found that the bombing had not only killed nine civilians but, according to the Gaza Coastal Municipalities Water Utility, it took out a nearby well – civilian infrastructure – prompting further questions over the proportionality, and so legality, of the strike.\u0026nbspNone of the half dozen family members, including injured children The Independent interviewed inidually, recognised the photo of the alleged PIJ commander that was originally identified as the target by the IDF’s Arabic spokesman.\u0026nbspNeighbours and relatives maintained that the family had been there since at least 2007: satellite imagery provided by HRW of the site in 2008, 2014, 2016 and immediately prior to the attack in 2019 – that was analysed by The Independent – appears to corroborate this.\u0026nbspThere is nothing obvious above ground in the imagery to suggest it is a military compound. \u0026nbsp‘Gaza strike: why didn’t\u0026nbspthey see the children?’Relatives said Rasmi was a retired police officer in the Palestinian Authority (run by Fatah, a rival to Hamas and PIJ) and Mohamed was a goat-herder, claiming there was no military activity at the site.One member of the community at the time of the strike told The Independent they believed one of the brothers may have been a member of the PIJ. However, neither the PIJ nor the Israeli authorities have publicly identified either of them as members of group or its armed wing. The PIJ regularly identifies its “martyrs”.\u0026nbsp“We had no warning, no one informed us the place would be hit even though there were so many children inside. It just happened all of a sudden, the house, the ground was shaking,” said Salmiya, 70, Rasmi’s mother who lives a few hundred metres away.“There is no military site there, or a weapons store, there isn’t even a flour store. There were no fighters. If it was a weapon store, we would have seen more explosions or any signs or effects from it,” said Hamdan\u0026nbspAbu Malhous, Rasmi and Mohamed’s cousin.\u0026nbspMr Abu Malhous queried how, if the Israeli military had checked the target in the days prior to the attack, they did not see the children.“The Israelis use drones day and night. Their machines and drones are so sophisticated they can photograph and identify an ant. How did they not see them?”\u0026nbsp‘There are not enough drones’While the air force personnel The Independent spoke to were not involved in this particular strike they said it was indicative of a wider problem and further evidence that the use of old or incomplete intelligence during bombing campaigns was “systemic”. \u0026nbspThe airmen painted a picture of a detailed official procedure to select and verify targets that is undermined by “serious structural problems”. They said this was compounded by the complexity of operating in Gaza, a densely populated territory where irregular construction occurs frequently, and military infrastructure is often co-located with civilian housing.\u0026nbspThe servicemen said that protocol dictates a timeframe for each type of target. For example, a large Hamas base would not necessarily have to be checked for a year since it is not likely to change.\u0026nbspBut a less permanent structure like the huts in the Gaza strike should have been, according to protocol, checked every few months for civilian presence.\u0026nbspThe selection of targets takes place in a “factory”, which for high-value targets is manned from the Israeli military headquarters: the Kirya in Tel Aviv. \u0026nbspPersonnel member “A” said according to military protocol, researchers need two independent types of intelligence that point to a possible target. \u0026nbspOnce the target is approved by senior officers it is transferred to operational intelligence, where a tactical team including weapons experts plan the strike in advance. Detailed photo presentations are usually pieced together to assist the pilots.There is also a system which automatically flags planned targets that are too close to sensitive buildings such as hospitals and mosques.\u0026nbspIn the planning phase, the unit consults lawyers who are supposed to provide legal advice on sensitive targets and the acceptable level of collateral damage in line with international law.\u0026nbspBut personnel “A” said the line of questioning is the wrong way around and so most targets are green-lighted. The lawyers will only ask the team if they think the strike would be proportionate – which is usually answered in the affirmative – rather than investigating the details of how the soldiers came to that conclusion.\u0026nbspIf the target passes these rounds,\u0026nbspit is “banked”, joining thousands of other targets ready for an escalation or war. In theory, researchers are expected to constantly loop back through their targets, checking whether there have been any new developments that may heighten the threat to civilians.\u0026nbspIn practice, however, once targets are banked, they are “rarely removed from the system”, even if there have been serious changes on the ground or a significant period of time has passed. Research teams are also under pressure to, and rewarded for, creating new targets.\u0026nbspPersonnel “B” agreed, saying particularly during the 2014 war “most of the air force targets that were attacked weren’t “cleaned” – meaning when the military has confirmed no uninvolved civilians are present at the site of the bombing target prior to the strike.“There was no capacity. I don’t know if there was a will, but for sure there was no capacity… We didn’t look at every target,” “B” said.\u0026nbspThe problem lay in the number of drones. Israel has an extensive number of unmanned aircraft that hover over Gaza both during and outside of conflict situations however personnel “B” said they are not just used by the air force but by all of Israel’s security and intelligence arms and are often not available ahead of strikes.\u0026nbspThese problems are heightened during periods of heavy bombardments, like the 2014 war when personnel were ordered to “make it rain bombs”, “B” said.\u0026nbsp“The Gaza Strip is a small place, and this target bank runs out pretty quickly,” “B” added.\u0026nbsp“Pretty quickly we kind of ran out of exactly what to attack.”He said it got to the point in 2014 where people within the air force were even questioning why the military campaign was still going on.\u0026nbsp“Everyone’s talking about what we’re doing here because the bank was finished,” “B” continued.\u0026nbsp“There was a sense we got from above, from the IDF command, that we needed to: attack, attack, make noise.”\u0026nbspPersonnel “A” said, however, these phases “are a blanket statement for the entire operation irrelevant to the actual risk to troops in specific areas. Instead, everything is elevated across Gaza,” raising questions about proportionality.\u0026nbspThe military can move up a phase, allowing more civilian casualties, if they feel the fire from the Palestinians is more intense but also if the Palestinian attacks are seriously “damaging morale” in Israel or even if the army believes international opinion would permit it, the personnel claimed.This is corroborated by several other\u0026nbsptestimonies gathered by Breaking the Silence and shared with The Independent.\u0026nbspBTS’s\u0026nbspMr Shaul said this protocol had to be reviewed.“The army moves to a higher operational mode, elevating collateral damage levels in one part of Gaza, meaning more people will die on the other side of the strip. Does that sound legitimate?”\u0026nbspHe said this is why the army’s internal reviews, like the most recent one into the 14 November strike, are “a cover-up”.\u0026nbsp“They are side-tracking us from the real problem which are the rules itself. The IDF’s investigations look into the violations of norms and rules and I am saying the norms and rules are the problem.“Most of the targeted civilians in Gaza were killed according to protocol.”\u0026nbsp‘There is not way you can attack Gaza without killing a lot of people’The other issue is the difficulty of trying to operate in the densely populated territory.\u0026nbspMany military targets in Gaza are co-located with civilian infrastructure due to the nature of the terrain and how Hamas and other militant groups operate in the Strip. The Israeli military has repeatedly accused both organisations of using human shields.\u0026nbspPersonnel “A” said, in theory, there are detailed protocols to work out how many people may be hurt or killed by a strike, including “completely scientific” statistical models that calculate damage.\u0026nbspBut that does not apply to the haphazard landscape of Gaza, “A” continued.\u0026nbsp“There is no way to accurately assess damage in Gaza. Any assessment is a bad assessment. There is no mathematical model for Gaza, it is too crowded to model,” the serviceman said.\u0026nbspThere is no way to accurately assess damage in Gaza. Any assessment is a bad assessment“A” added that since you cannot do serious intelligence work on a single building it’s impossible for thousands of targets.\u0026nbspPersonnel “B” agreed, saying it is hard to operate “in one of the most crowded neighbourhoods in the world”. This was particularly acute during the 2014 Gaza war when under-pressure commanders ended up green-lighting the phases of the war which permitted the highest levels of collateral damage.\u0026nbsp“In the end, the Strip is a finite area. The population has to move somehow. They can’t all disappear. So sometimes, you let loose. That’s the commander’s spirit. He says to the cell commanders: Guys, it’s up to you, the highest collateral damage rate, okay.”\u0026nbspMr Stein said that rather than systemic flaws in the\u0026nbspprotocol being the main problem, the overarching message from the Israeli government is “that Palestinians lives do not matter”.\u0026nbsp“It’s a matter of political will. As long as they continue to see Palestinians lives as irrelevant and something you can dispense of very easily, I don’t think it will change,” she said.It’s a matter of political will. As long as they continue to see Palestinians lives as irrelevant.. I don’t think it will changeBack in Gaza, the\u0026nbsprelatives of the November strike victims are left picking their way through the few remains of the homes for belongings, trying to make sense of what happened.\u0026nbspThe grandparents said the children who survived, some of them with severe injuries, are suffering from trauma and wake up screaming in the night.\u0026nbsp“We had to dig the children out when it first happened. There is just nothing left of the home, it is like the earth swallowed them up,” said Awad Abu Mismeh, 20, Rasmi’s son.\u0026nbsp“Why use three massive bombs to take out two families, some goats and a few huts.

The young folk born this century, like my -year-old daughter, do not watch it. The BBC means nothing to Generation YouTube.And the millions of us who grew up with the Beeb no longer recognise it as the benign Auntie that gave us Doctor Who, Top Of The Pops, Le On Earth, Fawlty Towers, The Likely Lads and David Dimbleby staying up all night at the General Election.That old beloved BBC — endlessly entertaining, scrupulously fair — is dead now. The BBC’s coverage of the night we left the European Union was nothing less than shameful.Here was a moment of truly historical signicance, the kind of national event that the BBC was born to cover. And it was dished up like a dull night at the Eurovision Song Contest.Down in Parliament Square, awash with Union Jacks and peaceful, happy patriots, BBC reporter Geeta Guru-Murthy blurted: “It’s a very white crowd mostly” — to the bewilderment of the many black and Asian people who were there to celebrate.But, of course, the BBC continues to peddle the filthy little lie that Brexit has its roots in the racism of the bigoted British people.Meanwhile, Sophie Raworth sat primly in a BBC studio made up to look like the EU flag. The studio never turned red, white and blue. There was no sense that the largest vote for anything in British history was being honoured. Why must we pay £billion a year for this one-sided garbage My colleague Ally Ross has pointed out that BBC “comedy” shows like Have I Got News For You, Frankie Boyle’s New World Order and The Mash Report have all been larded with anti-Brexit orthodoxy for years. Now the predictably loony Remainer-speak even seeps into the poison the BBC drips into our children.On the day we left the EU, the BBC released a CBBC Horrible Histories special mocking British stupidity.Queen Victoria was accused of callously sweetening her tea with sugar harvested by slaves — even though slavery was abolished four years before Victoria came to the throne.Historian Andrew Roberts described the mocking film as “a stream of bigoted hatred directed at this country”. They truly don’t get it in Broadcasting House. Millions of licence fee payers are deeply offended by the BBC’s relentlessly anti-British, anti-Brexit sentiment.It is why we fell out of love with the BBC. There is talk about decriminalising non-payment of the licence fee, or making payment optional. But the BBC no longer represents the entire nation. It peddles the prejudices of the disappointed elite who run it.The BBC does not speak for the British people. It doesn’t even seem to like us very much. So why should we pay anything at all for this crap AFTER being overlooked at the Oscars for her sensational performance in Hustlers, the half-time show at the Super Bowl felt like the revenge of Jenner Lopez.But Hustlers is my favourite film of the past  months. Lopez deserved an Oscar for her role.And whoever wins Best Actress at the Oscars tonight, I bet they can’t slide down a pole like her.MICHELLE OBAMA always said: “When they go low, we go high.”Meaning that when the Republican opponents of President Obama struck a low blow the Obamas had a strict policy of keeping their cool, their dignity and the moral high ground.The most senior Democratic politician in America just failed to take Michelle Obama’s advice. At his State of the Union address, President Trump petulantly refused to shake the hand of NancyPelosi, the Democratic Speaker of the House of Representatives. Pelosi should have shrugged off Trump’s rudeness and perhaps laughed in Donald’s orange face.Instead, clearly boiling with rage, Nancy ripped a copy of Trump’s speech to pieces. As the speech was full of optimistic stuff about making America a fairer, more prosperous place, the only person Pelosi humiliated was herself.The Democrats are starting to make Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party look like an effective opposition.THE classic James Bond films – Dr No, From Russia With Love, Goldfinger – were all less than two hours long.But in the modern fashion for over-long movies – The Irishman clocks in at three hours and  minutes – the next Bond film, No Time To Die, will be the longest ever at almost three hours.Let’s hope that means plenty of Ana de Armas, , as Bond girl Paloma. And not too much of Daniel Craig, , moaning about ’s dodgy knees.Teenage girls are messier than teenage boys. But teenage boys are, in my experience, more likely to leave takeaway pizza under the bed for six months for the mice to nibble.And when vermin move in, you really long for your little darling to move out.SUCKING up to the millionaire snowflakes in the audience, Prince William complained about the lack of ersity at the Baftas.I don’t believe it. This year a black actor, Micheal Ward, won the Rising Star Bafta for gang film Blue Story. Six years ago,  Years A Slave won Best Picture, competing with epic Hollywood fare like Gravity.If the film or performance is good enough, then the Baftas is colour blind.The real lack of ersity is among British actors. These days most of them went to Eton with Prince William. Now that’s what I call a lack of ersity.A SURVEY reveals that  per cent of Canadians are against paying the £million to-£million-a-year security bill for Harry and Meghan’s new le.Wherever they lay their hats, from Toronto to Tinsel Town, there is only one sucker who will ever pay for Harry and Meghan’s security.

But providing it does so through democratic means only, that should not upset many people.After all, it is up to the people of Northern Ireland, through a referendum, to decide whether they want to remain part of the UK or to join Ireland.Sinn Fein can, however, be relied upon to be even more hostile than Leo Varadkar — up until now Ireland’s leader — towards Britain in trade negotiations with the EU.If the party can score some kind of victory by opposing UK proposals, it will do so, making it more likely we will have no trade deal by December .Sinn Fein has used Brexit to its advantage, trying to drive a wedge between Britain and those in Northern Ireland who traditionally want to stay part of the Union.By negotiating a deal which puts some kind of border down the Irish Sea, Boris Johnson’s government has helped Sinn Fein’s cause. Former Irish leader Bertie Aern claimed yesterday that a referendum on a united Ireland will now come before the end of the decade.“I think a border poll is inevitable,” he said. “I think it’s probably five years off at least but the Sinn Fein position is it should be held within five years.”It is easy to see a scenario in which Northern Ireland votes to leave the UK and join Ireland, followed by a Scottish vote for independence.I am not sure where that would leave Boris’s plans for a Belfast to Stranraer bridge, which of course would have been paid for mostly by English taxpayers.All this said, however, there is little to suggest that those who voted for Sinn Fein on Sunday were motivated by concerns over Brexit or by a desire for a united Ireland.Strip away its dubious past and Sinn Fein is now a party of the Corbynite Left — it wants far greater social programmes, all funded by the wealthy.This could have serious consequences in a country whose economic success is founded on low taxes, especially company taxes. Ireland’s corporation tax rate is just . per cent, compared with  per cent in the UK. That has helped it become a magnet for investment.In terms of GDP per head, Ireland was poorer than the UK  years ago, but now it is signicantly richer.But whatSinn Fein was able to do what Jeremy Corbyn promised to do and soak the rich We might no longer have a Celtic Tiger on our doorstep, but a Celtic Sloth. The likes of Amazon and Google, which have established big presences in Ireland for tax purposes, might want to sht operations to Britain instead.Leo Varadkar had hoped he would be rewarded at the ballot box for holding a tough line in Brexit negotiations, but Ireland’s housing crisis seems to have been a far stronger concern.Ireland, even more so than Britain, has suffered from property booms and busts over the past two decades.Many young people have been priced out of the housing market and are struggling to even rent. Sinn Fein did well because it promised a three-year rent freeze and , new homes.These pledges helped the party — which has dominated Republican politics in Northern Ireland — come out of the margins south of the border and break the duopoly of the two main partiesIt won . per cent of the vote, while Fianna Fail, a socially conservative party, won  per cent, and Fine Gael, the more economically and socially liberal party of Leo Varadkar, won just  per cent.If Ireland had Britain’s first-past-the-post system, it would have been a landslide — Sinn Fein topped the poll in  of the country’s  constituencies.But given Ireland’s system of multi-member constituencies, it is far from guaranteed that Sinn Fein will even be in government at all.Before the election, Fianna Fail and Fine Gael both said they would not go into government with Sinn Fein. They could go into coalition with each other.In fact, Fianna Fail was already propping up Fine Gael in a confidence and supply arrangement. But with Sinn Fein topping the poll, this might prove a more dficult position to hold.Sinn Fein says it is exploring trying to put together a government without either of the main parties.But despite winning the biggest share of the vote, Ireland’s political establishment may yet succeed in keeping it out of power — and away from messing up the Irish economy. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But no.They’ve voted themselves an inflation-busting . per cent instead — so they’ll now get £ just for showing up.A few Lords and Ladies have experience and ability, we admit. The rest shuffle in for the warmth and the cash.The truth is the House of Lords is an antiquated insult to our democracy, a dumping ground for political failures and discredited cronies, where almost no one is too odious . . . though it still draws the line at Bercow, obviously.A courageous Government with a big majority would take it on and reinvent it as a mainly elected second chamber — with a small handful of unelected peers chosen for specic expertise.How about it, Boris THE decision on whether to proceed with the HS high-speed rail project was bound to upset plenty of people whichever way it went.So perhaps it is no surprise that Boris Johnson has tried to appease both its supporters and opponents by pressing ahead with the bulk of the £billion project, while putting two of its northern spurs on pause.But the PM is shrewd enough to realise that the places losing out — Crewe to Manchester and the West Midlands to Leeds — are the very areas that he must keep on sidehis -seat majority is not to be a one-off.Boris’s alternative transport plans for them, with improved bus and cycle links just a start, must not let them down.Otherwise the snub could see Labour rebuild its “red wall” of voters as quickly as he demolished it.THE Cabinet reshuffle this week must be bold. It will define Boris’s premiership.There are obviously talented contenders for bigger jobs: among them Michael Gove, Rishi Sunak and Victoria Atkins.But this is not the moment for the PM to reward other time-servers whose turn has come. Boris must not overlook fresh faces from the  and  intakes and, while it is probably too early for December’s newcomers, why not,they have the talent This Government already has a place in history simply by forcing Brexit through on January .With dynamic, imaginative, bright and brave ministers it can be truly radical too. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The same Boris Johnson — now PM — whose senior aides have just tried to ban certain journalists from an official government briefing.Go figure.VISITORS to the ancient, and usually peaceful, site of Glastonbury Tor have complained that their peace is being shattered by a “selfish” busker and his persistent bongo playing.I sympathise. Le’s precious silences are a rarity these days and the preoccupation with having music as a backdrop in everything from restaurants to toilets drives me to distraction. Particularly when most of it isn’t even good.Years ago, we had secured a wonderful people-watching seat in a Parisian cafe when an accordion player suddenly appeared on the pavement nearby.We endured a couple of songs but when it became clear he wasn’t moving, The Bloke asked how much he earned a night and was told: “About  euros.”Pressing a note into his hand, he said: “Here’s the same to p*** off to another location.”Which he duly did.So perhaps the Somerset bongo player is wilfully angling for a similar outcome.LAST year I applied for “veried fan status”, set my alarm and, after several nail-biting minutes, managed to secure two vastly expensive tickets to see Madonna’s Madame X show at the London Palladium for February , .Then, a couple of weeks ago, Her ­Madgeness announced that, owing to injury, she would be cancelling two shows of her -night run – and guess what . . .  Amazing how you can go off someone.TURNS out that the American woman who killed British teenager Harry Dunn by driving on the wrong side of the road is a former CIA spy.So what We already know she’s called Anne Sacoolas, we know where she lives in the US and we’ve even seen photos of her filling her car with petrol.So it’s not asany secret cover would be blown by her ing to Britain to answer accident-related questions in a British court.It changes nothing.“WE should be talking about what politicians do, rather than what they’re wearing,” says Shadow Culture Secretary Tracy Brabin piously after the online furore surrounding her outfit choice while addressing the Commons.In that case, best not wear an off-the-shoulder number better suited to a disco.SKY Sports presenter Jacquie Beltrao tweeted a photo of her -year-old son’s messy bedroom with a shout out of: “Can anyone compete with that ”Yep.We’ve had three Olympic-standard mess-pots in our house and one is still in residence.The rules have always been that no food is to be left lying around.Everything   I consider it their space, their problem and, most importantly, something I can simply close the door on and pretend it doesn’t exist.My daughters’ maths tests were beyond my capability by Year . Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We discover new species all the time.“I need to see to believe myself, but you cant say no.”Another viewer added: “That looks extremely dangerous and possibly aggressive.I would have a heart attackone of them things was looking in my window.”It comes after a mysterious video appeared to show a Bigfoot-type creature swinging through trees near a hiking trail in Calornia.And similar footage captured a large man-like creature peeking at tourists from behind a tree.Back in October , a farmer claimed he had seen a whole FAMILY of Bigfeet, carrying a pig while running through his Calornian ranch.It is thought to stand seven to  ft tall and weigh more than  stone, with footprints  inches long.Some think Bigfoot, who is also known as sasquatch, is a descendant of an extinct giant ape, but some claim it could even be an extra-terrestrial being.Over the years there have been numerous sightings of beasts people claim to be Bigfoot.There is scant physical poorf that that monster exists, but Bigfoot believers are convinced that they do, and that science will soon prove it.While most sightings of Bigfoot occur in the north west, the creatures have been reported all over the United States and Canada.Do you have a story for The US Sun team Email us at exclusive@the-sun or call --. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Perhaps for the first time, broadcast regulator Ofcom is to be charged with protecting members of the public from each other. Culture Secretary Nicky Morgan and Home Secretary Priti Patel released a joint statement following a consultation on how to protect the public from so-called ‘online harms’ - and said the were “minded” to expand Ofcom to do the job.The watchdog is to be put in charge of ensuring internet companies like Facebook, Twitter and YouTube maintain a “duty of care” to their users - ensuring illegal content posted by users is removed and monitoring for issues like cyberbullying and self-harm images.Firms could face fines - or worse -they fail to protect their users from seeing harmful material. Here’s how the proposed watchdog will work - and some of the potential pitfalls. What websites will it cover   In theory, any website which publishes ‘user generated content’.So that covers Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube and Reddit for starters.But it’ll also cover smaller, ‘niche’ online forums - although it’s thought Ofcom’s role policing and regulating them will be proportionate to their size. And it’s likely to end up covering the comment sections of news websites too - because comments are also ‘user generated content’. Probably not. Ofcom’s main focus, it seems, will be on illegal material - child sexual abuse images and terrorist propaganda. But they’ll also expect firms to have basic standards for what kind ofbehaviour and content is acceptable on their s - and will regulate the firms to ensure that is in case. Crucially, they’ll have a “duty of care” towards their customers, especially children and vulnerable people. Ofcom will be drawing up their own guidelines to require firms to tackle things like cyber bullying and self-harm. But it seems they won’t be directly involved in policing things like catfishing - where people pretend to be someone  to deceive others - or other kinds of disinformation. We won’t know exactly where the line will be drawn until Ofcom draws up its guidelines. And the point of regulating through Ofcom rather than the government doing it through the law is that an independent regulator will be able to react more quickly to “emerging threats.” Or, as critics would see it, they’ll be able to react more quickly to “emerging moral panics”. In the meantime, firms will be expected to follow their own ‘voluntary’ guidelines. Does this mean I can complain to Ofcom about something I’ve seen posted on Twitter   Complaints will still be handled by the social network, rather than handed to the regulator. And today’s statement says: “Recognising concerns about freedom of expression, the regulator will not investigate or adjudicate on inidual complaints.” So no, you won’t be able to complain to Ofcom about someone’s bad tweets, sorry. What about fake news  The statement appears to suggest Ofcom won’t be in charge of anything to do with ‘electoral integrity’ - which will be tackled in the Defending Democracy programme currently underway at the Cabinet Office. That probably means things like online political disinformation, advertising and propagandawon’t be within their remit. That has the added benefit of ruling out an Ofcom investigation into the Conservative Party rebranding its own Twitter account as a fake fact checking service during the election campaign.  Here’s where it gets a bit more vague. The statement says: “We will not prevent adults from accessing or posting legal content, nor require companies to remove specic pieces of legal content.” That said, it does suggest placing a responsibility on firms to “use a proportionate range of tools including age assurance, and age verication technologies to prevent children from accessing age-inappropriate content and to protect them from other harms.” The government quietly shelved its statutory online age verication plan last year, after it had been bungled and delayed for years. So it seems the government wants to make companies do it themselves, although it remains unclear whether this will be regulated in the same way as other content - with fines and warnings. Whatcompanies don’t keep up their ‘duty of care’ - and whatthey’re based overseas  The watchdog will be able to issue “notices and warnings, fines, business disruption measures, but also senior manager liability, and Internet Service Providerblocking in the most egregious cases.” The Mirror understands “business disruption measures” could mean ordering firms like PayPal not to allow payments to a certain company. And “Internet Service Providerblocking” means ordering all UK ISPs to block websitesthey refuse to comply. All of these are to be confirmed in legislation which will follow before the regulator takes control. But the Mirror understands both are “on the table” as potential solutions to sites like Chan or independent pornography sites which are based overseas, have no representation in the UK and refuse to remove illegal content or implement age verication. It also raises the usual concerns of what happens in the case of an online forum where a user has posted illegally obtained material - say, hacked emails published by Wikileaks. Would the new regulator - or the government - have the power to order UK ISPs to block such a website on that basis  "},{"url":null,"title":"letting pj masks run country","story":"NewsopinionLetting PJ Masks run the country would be a truly terrible ideaSleep-deprived children flogging us plastic crap form bad governments. So what childrens TV show would do a proper job ShareCommentsByFleet Street FoxColumnist:,  FEB Updated:,  FEB Newsopinion\" to FREE daily email alerts from Mirror - Royal FamilySubscribeWe will use your email address only for sending you newsletters. Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailDominic Cummings is father to a three-year-old child. This explains everything. The big ideas that come to nought, the paranoia, the randomised clothing. The ability to quote PJ Masks at child-free people who canapost decideitaposs Confucian wisdom or a symptom of dementia. As a parent of a pre-schooler, Cummings is probably riddled with anxiety, financial nightsweats and a fervent hankering for the days when his beloved heir could be legitimately put behind bars for a nice nap. Whether he should be whispering his twitchy-eyed thoughts into the Prime Ministeraposs ear, or still less obeyed, is an issue psychiatrists would need a week-long conference to debate. But what absolutely should not happen, under any circumstances, is for Disney childrenaposs show PJ Masks to take over the operation of the UK government. This is because PJ Masks are three sleep-deprived children who think night time is the right time to fight crime, as opposed to the right time to get some sleep, let their brains grow, and give their parents an opportunity for a nice, big, drink. They are insomniac brats who rely on magic to turn them into an owl, a cat, and a lizard. If Cummings thinks the government would be improved by cold-blooded, sociopathic regurgitators of bone fragments, then itaposs just possible heaposs playing for the wrong team.  But then again, PJ Masks has got the Cummings-Johnson government written all over it: Americanised impossibilities, sandwiched between sugar-coated adverts for corporate crap. And itaposs secretly a little bit French. As a rule of thumb, every parent knows that child-based television with adverts is best avoided. It only ever leads to more plastic, and the sort of magazines that cost the same as Vogue but are less educational. The one exception to this rule is Ben and Hollyaposs Little Kingdom on Channel , whose sarcastic and cack-handed Nanny Plum has warmed many an adult heart. They still shouldnapost run the country, though - Benaposs dense, Holly thinks princessing is the pinnacle of personal achievement, and Wise Old Elf is completely unaware of his own ironicwithin the narrative. Bit like Dominic Raab, really.  You canapost ask Paw Patrol to run the country, because Ryder spent his offshore trust fund on legal fees after being exposed in the Panama Papers scandal, and his HQ has been closed for so long itaposs filled with buddleia and tramps. Chase now clocks on as an ASDA security guard, Rubbleaposs hit the bottle, Rocky has gone off-grid to be an Extinction Rebellion activist and Zuma is completely forgotten, not for the first time. The only member of the pack winning at le is Skye, who is a cosmetically-enhanced Instagram influencer. Thereaposs no point asking Shimmer and Shine, either, because they grant only  wishes a day and have feet so tiny, and heads so large, that theyaposd keep falling over at state occasions.  The Floogals donapost understand anything and Butterbeanaposs Cafe has been closed down by the sugar police. Top Wing canapost be trusted with a pilotaposs licence, never mind a red box, and Wissper is too mindful to be of any practical use. Perhaps Nella the Princess Knight would make a good job of Prime Ministership, but her unicorn would just kidnap Prince Harry and make him bring her shiny things.  No,you want a childrenaposs show that can form a competent government, youaposll need to find it on CBeebies where some effort is made to educate, as well as entertain. Baby Club might smell nice, but itaposs a vomiting virus waiting to happen. Andyaposs Dinosaur Adventures, Iaposm afraid, had their turn in government during the s, and that ended with a meteor strike centred on that Northern Powerhouse we used to have. The Octonauts are too earnest, like Jeremy Corbyn. The Go Jetters are jet-owning hooligan rich kids who only narrowly avoid smashing the planet to pieces. Most days it seems like Mr Tumble is already running the country. A fat, bumbling and fairly-terrying clown who canapost competently put on his own trousers, and who when asked complicated questions blinks three times in the hope some magic will make things go away.  In the whole, sick and twisted realm of childrenaposs television, there are really only two options left. Thereaposs Biggleton, where children are trusted to do all the adult jobs in a slightly better and more inclusive fashion than grown-ups have yet managed. They have a tiny carbon footprint, but thataposs only because all the houses and cars are made of cardboard, and no-one ever has a holiday. Itaposs the world children want us living in by , but by then theyaposll be grown-ups desperate for some winter sunshine and weaposll all be dead. Letaposs not. Which leaves just one perfect candidate for World King. And itaposs not that whiny, entitled little s*** called Bing.  Duggee, the dog who loves everyone and whose cupboard is never bare of toys or hugs. The hound with a secret cheese basement, the leader who welcomes everyone to his pack, even Roly. Duggee talks to bees. Duggee officiates at weddings, regardless of sexuality or species. Duggee does disco, builds rockets, makes plans and provides handkerchiefs to polar bears. Duggee delivers biscuits into the very heart of darkness.  Duggee would fix climate change. Duggee makes you happy to pay the licence fee, so he can certainly make Amazon pay some tax. Duggee does not put up with crap from sleep-deprived toddlers, and nor, frankly, should we. And therein lies the root of this countryaposs problems. Dominic Cummings is tuned to the wrong channel.

Weeks before her  death, former nurse Shirley Guymer re-wrote her will to leave her Hampshire hilltop home to brother Terry and nephews Andrew and Malcolm. But her sister Diane Stoner, , and niece Karen Reeve, , claimed it was Terry and his sons behind the shocking change to her will - guiding Shirleyaposs hand as she left the house, on Butser Hill, near Petersfield, to their side of the family. Terry belittled and controlled cancer-stricken Shirley, they claimed, and together he and his clan stitched up an old lady in the months before her death.  Her previous will, signed in  and iding almost everything she had equally between her  nieces and nephews, with a bequest to the hospice where her husband died, should stand, they said. However, Terry, Andrew and Malcolm insisted the last will was valid and that stubborn and strong Mrs Guymer knew her own mind when she re-wrote it in hospital in . But today, after an eight-day trial at Central London County Court, the case was dramatically halted when the men agreed that the will leaving them the house should be scrapped. Instead the  will - which was backed by Mrs Stoner, Mrs Reeve and all of the family bar Terry and his immediate family - would be pronounced as her final will, lawyers said.  Despite hearing six full days of evidence, Judge Robin Hollington QC - who had previously termed the dispute a fight to the death - did not make a ruling on the specic allegations against the men. Speaking after the hearing this afternoon, Mrs Reeve said: We are absolutely delighted with the outcome and that Sheilaaposs wishes will be carried out. We are really pleased that Rowans Hospice, in Waterlooville, will now be receiving a legacy for the care that they gave to my late uncle, Sheilaaposs husband. This has taken four years of hard work. I would like to thank my mum Diane Stoner, my husband and all of my family. During the trial, the court heard Shirley spent her working le as a nurse at Queen Alexandra Hospital, Portsmouth, and lived with her dockyard electrician husband Bernard at the Butser Hill house from .  The land on which the house stood had been bought by Terry and he lived next-door to his sister and brother-in-law after handing over part of the plot to them. The couple did not have children and, after Bernardaposs death in , Shirley wrote a will, splitting almost everything she had equally between her nieces and nephews. However, two months before her death, two new documents were signed, first handing over part of her land to Terry and the next a new will completely dferent to her previous one. The new will instead left half of her house, known as Heatherdown and now valued at £,, to Terry, , with his sons Andrew, , and Malcolm, , getting a quarter share. The rest of her fortune, which amounted to about £, in cash and investments, was split in ious amounts between her five siblings and their children. Challenging the  will, barrister Julian Sidoli claimed that Shirley did not have the mental capacity to understand what she was doing when she signed it.  He claimed the will - signed in a hospital waiting room - was procured by undue influence of the three men and it was Malcolm who was the driving force behind it to ensure the house stayed on Terryaposs side of the family. Between you and the rest of your clan, you stitched up an old lady, Mr Sidoli put to Terry in the witness box. She lacked knowledge of the  will, she lacked capacity to make it in the first place, she was bullied and coerced by you and your family. The  will is Malcolmaposs will, not Shirleyaposs. Denying all the accusations, Terry branded them rubbish. His sister had simply changed her mind, knowing that she was terminally ill, he claimed. Carol Davies, for Terry and the brothers, said Shirleyaposs own GP thought she was well enough to make the will and that her change of heart could easily be explained by the fact that the house was originally owned by Terry and she wanted it to revert back to him on her death. The purported allegations are in reality aposmud-slingingapos with attempts to cast aspersions on the defendants with implications that they unduly influenced the deceased, she said. There is nothing credible in the claimantsapos case or evidence to support any findings of undue influence by any of the defendants, their wives or family or others, by inference or otherwise. Giving evidence, Malcolm denied any wrongdoing and said his aunt, Shirley, had been like a second mum to him. He and his brother had grown up next to her on Butser Hill and she referred to them as her sons of Butser, he claimed.  She looked after me as a baby. She looked after me through the years we lived together and then I looked after her when she became poorly and ultimately until she passed away, he said. But Mr Sidoli claimed Malcolm had actively participated in the making of the new will in January , going beyond merely helping his increasingly vulnerable aunt. It appears it is Malcolm giving the instructions, he told the judge. He is not acting as a conduit....she is a passive passenger. The court heard Diane and Karenaposs case was supported by all of the family, except Terry, Andrew, Malcolm and their immediate family. Diane told the court she would get nothingthe  will is overturned, but still decided to fight it as she wanted her sisteraposs wishes respected. Iaposm not happy because my sister told us all that she had left it to her nieces and nephews and they were all aware of it, she said. The disappointment was acute for them and the whole family. Iaposm not here for myself. Itaposs more of a moral issue. Her sister, Dee Parker, who also supported the case, told the judge that Terry had constantly controlled and belittled Shirley. She didnapost hate him. She loved him, but she was frightened of him, she said. I donapost hate him, she added. But I am ashamed of him.

Despite denying that Ruby Williams was discriminated against and not admitting liability, Urswick Schoolaposs governing body agreed to the out-of-court settlement. Rubyaposs family took legal action against the school in Hackney, east London, with the backing of the European Human Rights Commisssion. They claim Ruby, who was  at the time, was repeatedly sent home while studying for her GCSEs for breaching the schoolaposs unorm policy. The family also claimed that in the teenageraposs Year  year book a photo of her from Year  was used where she had straight hair. Parents Kate and Lenny Williams, told the Independent the three-year battle has “destroyed” their daughter’s confidence during her vital school years and she missed a lot of lessons amid the dispute. And Ruby herself said she felt humiliated and stressed for being sent home, after letting her natural hair grow. She said: The reason I was given is that my hair might block someone seeing the whiteboard or teacher. As my dad is a Rastafarian he has always stressed that hair is very important, but it was only after I faced this that I understood what he meant by that.  The schoolaposs policy, which has now been removed, said hairstyles should be “reasonable and should not impact on other students. It had no restriction onbut added that long hair must be tied back for PE, science and technology. The settlement offer was made by the London Diocesan Board for Schools directly to Rubyaposs family, without any admission of liability from the school. A statement from the governing body at Urswick School said: “The governing body is hugely distressedany child or family feels we have discriminated against them.

No way, before adding: Is there a way to hold her  Wow, look at that. She asked a youngster next to her: Do you want to touch the snake  Kate added: Sheaposs got the most amazing skin. This is the first time Iaposve ever held a snake like that. How cool is that  The snakeaposs handler Sophie Wrigglesworth, , from County Down said they had not originally planned to bring the snake out to the duchess as they had been advised she had a fear of them. But she said, aposoh no, I want to see the snakeapos, straight away she held it, she said, adding that they often receive visitors with a fear of snakes. We have a creepy crawly loft, spiders, hissing cockroaches, and stick insects, you often get people who say aposoh no, Iaposm not touching themapos but then they do have a feel and it encourages them to face their fears.  It was good fun meeting the duchess, quite nerve wracking initially but she was so calm and collected, and she was good at approaching people and making sure everyone felt comfortable. During her one-stop solo visit to Northern Ireland on Wednesday, Kate was given a guided tour of the farm in Co Down, meeting the owners and staff at the family-run attraction. She laughed and chatted with young children as she made her way around the farm, pointing out a large bull to a little boy, exclaiming massive, heaposs huge isnapost he , before admiring a brown alpaca which seemed as eager as the crowds of people to meet the royal visitor, trotting across its stall to her as she approached.Next was the turn of some of the smaller animals as Kate joined a group of children petting a rabbit, before one to feed a lamb. The visit comes as the mother of three has turned the spotlight on early childhood development, which is aimed at improving le chances by supporting expectant parents, parents and carers of children up to five years old, young children and their families. Kate also spent time at the Ark speaking to parents, carers and grandparents of children about some of the challenges they face. She listened sympathetically as she moved around tables in the cafe as she was told about issues before moving into a private conversation. The visit came to an end with the duchess unveiling a plaque to mark the th birthday of the Ark.

Detective Constable Louise Osborne said the victim is very lucky to have not been more seriously injured in the altercation. She said: “The kne caused an arterial bleed and the victim lost a signicant amount of blood which required emergency surgery to stop the bleeding.  There is the possibility that without the excellent first aid and assistance he received at the scene by members of the public and the police officers he may not have survived.

The Duke of Sussex, , has discussed working with the controversial US finance firm. Contact with Goldman began in November, around the time Harry and Meghan said they were going to quit the royal family, a royal source says. Their bid for financial independence has now led to a PR guru suggesting they may earn £billion in corporate deals and brand ambassador roles. Harry may follow footballer David Beckham and actress Gwyneth Paltrow to be a guest speaker at the bank’s Talks at GS. Goldman does not pay its guest speakers for the series but, sources say, it could pave the way for the Sussexes to forge a l­ucrative future relationship. Last week Harry spoke at an event sponsored by another big bank, JP Morgan, in Miami about having therapy and his struggles to deal with his mother’s death. But the couple’s courting of big corporations is alarming some in royal circles who fear they could sully the royal brand.

Sonya Young gave up her job to concentrate on a legal fight after her dad Brian Cole donated £, to the Royal National Leboat Institutein his will. Meanwhile Sonya and her dadaposs partner got just £, each. Former leboat captain Mr Cole killed himself aged  in  -  days after he signed off the will.Mrs Young has been fighting the charity since  in a bid to prove her dad was not in his right mind when he made his final will, Wales Online reports.But in July last year, Judge Paul Teverson found in favour of the charity, upholding the will and ruling that Mr Cole had known what he was doing. He had made a conscious decision to “disinherit” his daughter after a bad falling out, the judge said. Mrs Young went on to pay £, of her dad’s money to the RNLI, but had already spent around £,, the court heard. Now, at the request of RNLI lawyers, the judge has imposed a charging order on Mrs Young’s £, house in Dinas Powys, southern Wales, and the court was told the property might have to be sold to pay off the “shortfall” she owes to the charity under her dad’s will. London’s High Court heard that Mr Cole, who was worth around £, when he passed away, had named his only daughter as his main heir under a previous  will. But in another will he executed in , he largely “disinherited her” in favour of his then girlfriend Angela Saunders. His last will in , however, left both women only £, each, with nearly all of his assets going to the RNLI in honour of his former service as a leboatman “for the purpose of the upkeep of the Penarth leboat and the station at Penarth”.  Daniel Burton – the RNLI’s barrister – claimed there was a troubled history between father and daughter, and that there had been some “fundamental disagreement” between them. “The evidence is clear that his intention was to disinherit his daughter and he had already done that pursuant to his previous will,” he added. But Mrs Young claimed: “I don’t believe my father had testamentary capacity... I believe this is a case where there are questions.” Judge Teverson said Mrs Young’s only possible challenge to the will hinged on claims that her father was not of sound mind. But the evidence did not suggest this, the judge found, saying the changes Mr Cole made to his ious wills “are explained by him falling out with his daughter and then with his partner”. The judge ruled in favour of the  will and the RNLI.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailTucked away deep in Chinaaposs wilderness, a cave full of wild bats could hold answers for scientists desperate to crack the coronavirus enigma. Its exact location is a secret, but several years ago the group of scientists who studied the cave somewhere in the Yunnan province made a curious discovery in the blood of people living nearby. They found the cave was full of bats carrying SARS-related coronaviruses - and blood tests on residents living nearby revealed they appeared to have immunity. As a novel outbreak sweeps the world and the death toll soars above , in China, the virologistsapos find is being viewed with fresh curiosity - and alarm. Reports say the researchers had noted with concern in the years before the current coronavirus outbreak that SARS-like viruses could jump from bats to humans - with chilling consequences. The mysterious bat cave and its human neighboursapos immunity could hold key for scientists racing to find solutions to combat the outbreak, now officially known as COVID-. The new virus has already overtaken SARS, with the death toll in China eclipsing the previous outbreak and thousands more cases confirmed there, as the sickness spreads around the world. But the researchers who made the discovery have found themselves emerging in the spotlight for all the wrong reasons in China as their studies attract renewed international interest. Lead researcher Zheng-Li Shi, of the Wuhan Institute of Virology has been widely searched on Chinaaposs social media and even labelled the aposmother of the devilapos as theories alleged the new coronavirus escaped from her lab in the city where the virus originated.  Ms Shi had produced a  draft paper that suggested that the virus responsible for SARS was a member of the coronavirus group seen in the bats. The scientist was forced to respond and reject the theories this week, saying I swear with my le, [the virus] had nothing to do with the lab, the South China Morning Post reports. Writing in recent weeks in the New York Times, David Quammen, the author of aposSpillover: Animal Infections and the Next Human Pandemicapos made the link between the virologistsapos discovery and todayaposs outbreak in an opinion piece.  He pointed to the virologistsapos  draft paper, and Ms Shiaposs teamaposs second study in  that involved taking samples from the bats and investigating blood samples from people living nearby.  The earlier study had noted the bats in the cave hosted a iety of coronaviruses similar to the SARS outbreak at the time, which killed  people and infected more than , worldwide. The draft paper has not yet been peer-reviewed - an important gold standard to test the merit of all new scientic studies. However in , the virologists set out their second set of findings following five years of research focused on the Yunnan cave, this time investigating fecal samples collected from its bat population. They found coronaviruses in four dferent species of bats, including one virus with a genome % identical to the virus first discovered emerging in humans in Wuhan in December. The virus found in the bats that shares genetic similarities to the killer COVID- sweeping the globe is distinct from the SARS virus, according to the study. Peter Daszak, the president of EcoHealth Alliance, a private research organisation that had worked with Ms Shi and a co-author on both of the Yunnan studies, told the New York Times the researchers had been aposraising the flagapos on these types of viruses for years. Mr Daszak told how the researchers had also taken blood samples from a couple of thousand of Yunnanese people living nearby for the  research, including about  who lived directly near the bat cave.  The study found that roughly % of them carried antibodies against SARS-related coronaviruses. The researcher said the results told scientists that the likes of the current coronavirus outbreak in humans is no new phenomenon. “We don’t knowthey got sick. We don’t knowthey were exposed as children or adults,” Mr. Daszak told the Times. “But what it tells you is that these viruses are making the jump, repeatedly, from bats to humans.” Early reports on the novel coronavirus which originated at a food market in the Chinese city of Wuhan, suggested the new virus could be linked to bats. However its exact origin is not yet clear and scientists are investigating whether it sprung from any number of animals sold for human consumption at the market, including snakes and pangolins.  The World Health Organisation yesterday warned the novel coronavirus poses a aposvery grave threat to the rest of the worldapos. WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus made the appeal for rapid solutions to combat the outbreak as Chinaaposs death toll surged, and the virus spreads around the world, including the UK. The WHO also yesterday gave the novel coronavirus its official name: COVID-, referring to the group of viruses it belongs to rather than the current outbreakaposs strain. The organisation named it with no direct reference to its origin, as the WHO on principle avoids stigmatising any group of people or country when it names viruses. As Mr Tedros told reporters yesterday, there were already “some concerning instances of onward transmission from people with no travel history to China. He referred to concerning cases in France and Britain, including the discovery of a so-called apossuper spreaderapos, a British businessman who had travelled from Singapore back to the UK. Businessman and scout-leader Steve Walsh, , yesterday revealed his identity and spoke out from quarantine at Guyaposs Hospital in London, where he revealed he had no symptoms until he re-entered the UK. But authorities fear Mr Walsh may have come into contact with hundreds of people - and unknowingly infected at least  between contracting the virus and his isolation. China has now temporarily outlawed the trade in wildle for food.

Chitetsu Watanabe from Niigata was today officially confirmed by the Guinness Book of Records as the longest living male at  years and  days old. He was born on  March,  in the town where he currently lives as the first of eight children of his father Haruzo and mother Miya. Chitetsu moved to Taiwan for  years to grow sugar cane, before serving in the military towards the end of the Pacic War in . He ed to Niigata with his we Mitsue and four young children during a dficult period in Japanese history. Both Chitetsu and Tetsuo told me that getting to places and sourcing food was a struggle, Yoko Watanaba, the we of Chitetsuaposs son Testsuo said. Having to live under that circumstance with four young children must have been tough.  Despite his ample years Chitetsu has barely slowed down. Following his retirement, in  he and Tetsuo set up a one hectare farm next to his family home. For the next  years - until Chitetsu was  - they grew potatoes, tomatoes, strawberries and plums on the land together.He also kept more than  bonsai trees, which he presented at a local exhibition in . Chitetsu has always loved sweet things and counted brown sugar as his favourite treat. Since losing his teeth however, he has had to stick to custard pudding, the cream inside chou à la crème and other deserts which require little chewing.  As for the secret to his longevity, he told a local paper last year it is not to get angry and keep a smile on your face. Chitetsu now lives in a care home and is not as active as he once was. Until last summer his daily activities including exercising, origami, calligraphy and maths.

Masana Izawa decided long ago to forgo conventional, indoor toilets in favour of secluded areas outside his home in the Ibaraki Prefecture, north of Tokyo. The -year-old has been relieving himself in the open air since , after becoming embroiled in a fight to stop a waste treatment plant being built. As he looked at the “dead river” of feces that ran through his neighbourhood, and heard the arguments of those fighting against an industrialised solution, Mr Izawa realised no one was willing to take ownership of their waste. So he decided he would. Mr Izawa still remembers the first time he left the comfort of his bathroom and dropped his trousers outdoors. “Even though it was very dferent from the previous defecation in the toilet, it was not physically and mentally uncomfortable,” he told MirrorOnline. In fact, Mr Izawa experienced “great joy” at feeling fully responsible for his excretions for the first time. While some people may have filed the trip outdoors in the ‘one-off’ cabinet of human experiences, he became fully committed to the cause and, almost five decades on, remains an enthusiastic advocate for open defecation. Combining the act with his day job as a published and well-respected photographer of mushrooms and mosses, Mr Izawa has perfected the act of outdoor defecation to a point of near totality.  In the past  years, he has used a toilet just  times and made more than , open air bowel movements. Underpinning his commitment to the act is a well-considered philosophy based on the circularity of nature.

We used to be jealous of what other clubs were doing before but we’re now probably one of the frontrunners.“We’re doing a lot of things other teams are aspiring to do. Because of the money and finance put in, it certainly makes your job a lot easier and helps a long way.“When you’re attracting young players to join the club, you want the kids to come into an elite environment rather than what it was before.“We weren’t bad before but there was no finance to do it properly. Andy Goldie is driving it on and we’ve managed to get to Elite status which is brilliant.“Restructuring the whole thing has meant new faces have come in with new ideas.“It’s about evolving all the time, you can’t just sit and accept it because that’s what was happening  or  years ago.”That said, Bow still believes attitude is what will help players get to where they want to be, citing former United man and Liverpool star Andy Robertson as an example.“That’s one of the biggest things I see with kids that are talented,” he added.“It’s how you install it into them to give that extra %. When you come out the other end of an academy, that’s the bit that will help you.“You need to be disciplined. Even since I played, and it’s changed a lot since then, football’s been like that.“You can’t go out every night, you’ve got to practice things and get the basics right first before you work on your game.“We’re wanting to give them the whole package by putting all the fragments together and glue them so we get better players at the end of the day. vw, px\"  “I’m a great believer in always getting to where you want to go.“You could stay here, play in the first team and,you’re good enough, you could always move.“We’ve had one recently with Banksy .“Andy Robertson is a fine example, to have came from Queen’s Park then come up here.“From us he probably could’ve gone straight to a Liverpool or a higher team but he went to Hull and earned his stripes.“Sometimes they want to accelerate it and get from down at E right up to A straight away, rather than working their way up.“That’s the way it goes sometimes and I’ve seen others like wee Gauldy .“I’d have put my mortgage on wee Gauldy being a success at Sporting eventually but, unfortunately for him, things turn out dferent ways.“He’s still playing in Portugal, of course, but he was the one I thought would’ve kicked on.“If I’d looked at Andy and Gauldy back then I’d have probably said Gauldy was the better player. It says a lot about Andy’s character as well and his real drive and determination.”Not everyone can be Andy Robertson, though, Bowman concedes.“I always think the Dutch are a brilliant example because even when players leave the likes of PSV and Ajax, they’ll go where.#Whereas, sometimes in Scotland they’ll drop out of academies and then football altogether.“We’d like to see those boys progress and keep playing as well. That’s a big part of my job, too.“I hope that when they come in full-time with us, they’ll aspire to be players at one level or another.“They’ve just got to show what they’re about. If you want to give that extra , , % to get there it will help you in the end.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/01/5e1d87ad189e41.81565320-536x564.jpg ","title":"current dundee crop must find their voices says former hero rae","story":"A squad packed with huge characters roared Dundee to their last Championship title.Now the skipper of that side has challenged the Dark Blues’ beleaguered current crop to find their voices.Gavin Rae capped a glittering -year playing career by leading Dundee to the Premiership six years ago.It was a team full of influential figures.And Rae wants the top boys in today’s side – two of whom he knows well – to instil some pride ahead of a crucial play-off run-in.“I came up against Christophe Berra on a number of occasions,” said Rae.“He was always a tough opponent – and he’s got loads of experience to draw on.“Graham Dorrans, I roomed with him on Scotland duty. It was very late in my international career and very early in his to be fair!“But you just have to look at his career to see the quality he’s got. You don’t play in the Premier League for as many years as he did without being a very, very good footballer.“These are the guys that can turn it round for Dundee – the big characters.“The season I captained the team to the Championship title, we had loads of characters in that dressing-room, and it kept us going through what was a rollercoaster season.“It was touch and go at times but guys like Peter McDonald, Ian Davidson, myself, Kyle Benedictus and Christian Nade kept it ticking over.“You need leaders in any successful team, and with Christophe and Graham in the current side, they should be the ones setting the standards.”Standards of late have not been high enough at Dens Park.A run of four Championship games without a win since the festive season has seen the Dens men drop out of the play-off places.For a side who started the season with designs on a title charge, that is a cause for concern.But Rae believes the talent peppering the Dee squad ought to be enough to turn the tide – and ensure at least a shot at a quickfireto the Premiership.“If you look at the Dundee side, there are guys with plenty of Premiership experience there,” he said.“You’ve got Jack Hamilton at the back, Christophe in front of him, Dorrans in the middle, Kane Hemmings up top . . . the list goes on.“These are the guys James McPake will be asking to drive the team on in the second half of the season. vw, px\"  “They’ve been there and done it – some of them at a very high level.“So you have to think thatthey turn it on, they’ve got enough about them to get Dundee firing again.“Things have been tough in recent weeks and being out of the play-off places is not good.“The players have to fight to turn that round because another season in the Championship isn’t ideal – and it could easily happen.“But, for me, there should be enough experience and quality there to turn the tide.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/02/19831881-940x552.jpg ","title":"dundee 2 0 partick hemmings double earns dark blues first win of 2020 with dominant display","story":"Dundee finally picked up their first victory of  with a dominant - victory over bottom club Partick Thistle at Dens Park.Two first-half Kane Hemming goals did the damage for the Dark Blues as they moved back into the play-off places with a first three points since beating the Jags at Firhill on December .Dens boss James McPake made three changes after Cammy Kerr and Jordan McGhee underwent surgery during the week.That saw Josh Meekings come in to join Christophe Berra and Jordon Forster in a back three while Paul McGowan ed to partner Kane Hemmings up front and Christie Elliott made his first start.Andrew Nelson was on the bench after recovering from surgery himself alongside new signing Tom Field.The home side made a positive start and got the all-important breakthrough on  minutes.It stemmed from Meekings launching a throw into the Partick box and earning a corner. Declan McDaid lofted the kick into the box for Forster to steam in and head goalwards, only to see striker Hemmings knock it in on the line.Minutes later Dario Zanatta flashed a low shot wide of Conor Hazard#s post before Hemmings got his second of the afternoon on  minutes.Shaun Byrne#s long punt up top was miscontrolled and McGowan was all over the mistake. He played in his strike partner, who brushed off the Partick defence to fire past Scott Fox.Partick came out with more le about them in the second half with Zanatta a threat but Dundee were still creating chances and went close six minutes after the restart.First, McDaid saw a low cross kicked away by goalkeeper Fox before Ross Callachan was played in but could only hit the keeper with his effort from inside the area.On the hour, Christie broke forward but took the wrong option in choosing to shoot rather than pass before Fox again beat out a dangerous McDaid cross on  minutes.On  minutes, Dundee lost Callachan as he was stretchered off injured with Nelson replacing him.With six minutes to go, Brian Graham looked to have the chance to give the Jags a leline but he handled when controlling and the chance was gone.In the closing stages the Dark Blues were happy to see the game out as they moved back to fourth spot, three points behind second-placed Inverness.Dundee: Hazard, Forster, Meekings , Berra, McDaid, Christie, Byrne , McGowan, Dorrans, Callachan , Hemmings .Subs not used: Hamilton, Field, Cameron, Strachan.Partick: Fox, Penrice, O#Ware , Brownlie, Cardle , Bannigan, Graham, Cole, Zanatta, Barjonas , O#Connor .Subs not used: Sneddon, Robson, Austin.Attendance: ,"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/01/5e184ad61963d8.69056156.jpg ","title":"forster happy to swap goal for clean sheet","story":"Jordon Forster admits he hasn’t dealt well with being out of the Dundee team but is delighted to have made a positive impact on his– evenhe’s had to begrudgingly give up claims for a first goal of the season.The big centre-back was taken out of the firing line back in December after a costly error against Queen of the South and a dficult day at the back in the following home match against Dunfermline.But he has responded with two strong performances that have helped the Dark Blues pick up four points from their last two matches with a draw at Morton followed up by Saturday’s - win over Partick Thistle.Speaking to the Tele, Forster admits his time out of the team hasn’t been the easiest.He said: “I was on the bench for a few games.“It was dficult to deal with and, being honest, I don’t deal with that very well!“It’s the manager’s decision at the end of the day.“I hope I’ve shown enough to remain in the team for the next game.“It’s part and parcel of football, the boys who came in have done well.“It is a team game, at the end of the day, we have a squad for the whole season and every single one in the squad is important.“As long as the team is doing well, it’s all good.”With the score at -, Forster thought he’d opened his scoring account for the Dark Blues as he powered a header goalwards only to see striker Kane Hemmings knock the ball over the line.“First goal of the season, yeah!” said Forster.“To be fair, Kane got the last touch on it. It was going in but Kane is a good striker and good strikers make sure –he wants the goal, he can have it!“The main thing was to get the win and a clean sheet as well – I would trade the goal for a clean sheet, to be honest.”Saturday’s shutout was Dundee’s first since they last met the Jags on December  and their first at Dens since October .“We got a lot of clean sheets at the start of the season and I think we came away from basing our game on that,” added Forster.“It’s nice to be back in the team, not quite scoring, but helping us get three points.“It was a blustery day and conditions on the pitch weren’t brilliant.“I think we made the best of it and got the best possible outcome.“The boys played well, we were really dficult to beat and we made a big thing of getting to second balls and closing people down.“We worked harder than we have been – that can be a hard thing to say to players but I think it has showed in the last couple of games where we have really got after teams and put them under pressure. Other teams do that to us and it’s dficult to deal with.”The victory puts Dundee back in the play-off spots as they retook fourth place.“The league is very tight. There have been a lot of tough games recently and I’m sure everyone was looking at the league table and saying ‘ we win this, we go there,we lose, we’re here’, that’s human nature.“We were fully aware of how big and important Saturday’s game was.“Come pm, we’ve won - and getting the three points is good news.

She would be so proud.“Even more importantly for us as a family is that Academy Street Dance Studio will continue to run and that’s a legacy it its own.“She always called the studio her extended family and that’s how it still is.”Offshore safety expert Mr Rae said: “When I was informed that I was chosen I was in disbelief.“As an Aberdonian born and bred it fills me with pride to be recognised as one of its everyday heroes.”Clan fundraiser Mr Taylor said: “I am shocked and also honoured to have been chosen for this award and I would like to thank my family and friends that nominated me.”Mr Brown said: “I’m delighted and humbled to be honoured by my city of birth and raising awareness of Clare’s Law is invaluable.”And Mr Ritchie added: “It feels amazing to be recognised in this way – thanks so much to everyone that nominated me.”Aberdeen Inspired community and environmental co-ordinator Angela Joss said: “While working on this project it became obvious to us that the everyday heroes had changed Aberdeen and the community around them.“We have six examples of amazing Aberdonians and it makes me really proud to be one.”Lord Provost of Aberdeen Barney Crockett praised the scheme and said each of those honoured was a “fabulous ambassador” for the city.And Mike Melvin, ACVO co-ordinator who was on the judging , said: “All nominations were outstanding and very inspiring.”"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column december 27 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLooking back over the last  months, no single story has dominated the headlines in these pages, but there have been important themes.There are the negative trends, of course.

All have end-stage organ failure, be it kidney, liver, lung or heart, and require a le-saving transplant.Organs for transplant usually come from bodies of people who agreed to donate before death. But as this does not produce enough organs, both Scotland and England plan to bring in an #opt out# system, meaning that on death a person#s agreement to organ donation is assumed unless they had actively opted out.Live donation is an alternative to awaiting a cadaveric organ. As people can live happily with one kidney or half a liver, family members or altruistic iniduals sometimes offer to donate these organs. Since matching donor and recipient tissue-type, however, is generally required these donations are not always acceptable.Now groups of tissue-type incompatible donor recipient pairs are getting together to mix and match, producing duos who are tissue-type-compatible. So let#s say Annie is rejected as a kidney donor for her sister Jean for incompatibility reasons, and similarly, Arthur is rejected as kidney donor for Jim. But pairing donor Annie with recipient Jim and Arthur with Jean could lead to two successful transplants. A recent report from the US describes the first ever bi-organ exchange involving a liver-kidney swap * .In this specic case a daughter wished to donate a kidney to her mother with renal failure but was rejected because she might later develop the same kidney problem. So she offered half of her liver in exchange for a kidney for her mother. Another donor was eventually identied who wanted to donate half her liver to her sister with liver failure but was rejected because her liver was too small. But she was cleared for kidney donation. So on the day of the swap four operations took place and two needy people received le-giving new organs.Although not presently being considered in the UK, with the ethical issues sorted, this multi-swap procedure opens the way for extended chains of donors and many more lives saved.*Torres et al Am J transplant. :-."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column january 10 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsCouncillors wil be put in an unenviable position when they finally decidewhere the axe will fall on council services.But exactly how much Argyll and Bute will have to spend will not be known until the daffodils are beginning to pop through the ground.

Their health suffers and the prospect of developing economically remains out of reach. For women and young girls, the consequences can be even worse, with many being attacked and raped when they use outdoor spaces.

Nearly three years later I fear the dream is still a long way from that reality.Mid Argyll Youth Development Servicescertainly seems to have ambitious plans for an indoor skate park and this is to be lauded, however a quick look online will show an apparent apathy with regard to moving forward with the project. A young man created the #Lochgilphead Skate Park Association# on Facebook in , yet a final post in  indicated how little the proposal had moved forward. If the project needs more money to actually get it built we need to know how much, so that appropriate funding can be sought.What is causing the project to take years to come to fruition The potential for help by the £ million Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund in  was dashed when councillors instead decided that improvements to road junctions, streets, a cycle track and indoor bowling were more important, and allocated a staggering £, to feasibility studies for these projects alone, this is before any work is actually done, you understand.That is a great deal of money for feasibility studies and design works.Let us be realistic # in nine long years the community has gone from the initial excited buzz about a skate park to finally managing to purchase a plot of land upon which to build it in early . From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets. Even into the s local authorities ran youth clubs and had excellent people called #youth leaders#. No more. #We cannot afford them# is the call of the day. Without them the honourable behaviour of society will continue to deteriorate.So my plea to politicians is simple # stop making us all criminals by passing more and more laws and start supporting and encouraging agencies, groups and people who indirectly and directly instil in iniduals behaviour of which all can be proud.Finlay CraigCoveSir,There is all the hoo-ha at the moment over the lesser royals deciding its going to be a better le that beckons from opting out from royal duties # perhaps wanting a less stressful, more normal, le for themselves and their family as ordinary people away from the media hype and national newspapers.It was lovely, however, to see in the same week front page on the local paper a real regional award for a less well-known commoner.An MBE given for services to the local youth community, making this two great awards for Lochgilphead in recent years and showing that local strong ladies in Mid Argyll do have what it takes.Hard work and true Scottish grit and determination in their hearts for the area and community. More of the same meritorious awards for the ordinary people of Scotland please.Credit to all editors and staff for their outstanding journalism given over the years in all of Scotlands progressive, thriving local papers.Stephen Jones, Oban"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures january 3 2020 2","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThis week#s photograph whas been submitted by Tom Cullen of Ardfern.The serene scene was taken overlooking the Crinan estuary at about .am on Friday January ."},{"url":null,"title":"lochgilphead bowls into 2020","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLochgilphead Bowling Club launched into the new year with the first of its indoor singles competitions.Some  members played for the Argyll Arms Ardrishaig trophy on Saturday January  and after some great matches throughout the afternoon it was Alan Guy and Neil Ward that progressed to the final.In a closely fought final, Neil Ward edged the victory in the last end, winning -."},{"url":null,"title":"tarberts senior citizens party the night away","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowWet and windy weather failed to dampen the spirits of Tarbert’s seniors as they gathered in the village hall for the senior citizens# Christmas dinner.A large number of willing volunteers had organised a sumptuous meal and decked the hall with multi-coloured fairy lights and balloons to provide a warm welcome for their guests.The familiar venue quickly came alive with smiles, hugs and the happy chatter of friends gathering for this much-loved annual event which has been going for more than  years.Elma McGougan and Jean Johnston, who had served on the original organising committee, reminisced about their experiences, explaining they ran fund-raising events and that many in the village donated money and goods so the dinner could be provided free of charge.The event, held this year on Friday January , is still organised by a committee and continues to be generously supported by businesses and iniduals in the village and surrounding area.Elma said: #In the s, the women on the committee made soup and brought it along.

Back then, we had ice-cream and jelly for dessert.#Jean added: #It was all good fun and we had loads of laughs.#Elma continued: #We used to have sales to raise money for the dinner. Santa was on the stage and Jean’s children were his elves. They were only little then.#We modelled the clothes and the older women loved the bargains. We thought they were old, but they were probably the age we are now,# Elma said laughing. #We would shout #Roll up, roll up# to get them to come and see what we had on offer.#After a warm welcome from compère Martin Jefferies and a prayer of thanks for the food, the five-course meal was expertly served by members of the organising committee and their youthful helpers.A raffle, again free of charge, saw a large number of guests receive prizes and no-one was left disappointed as the remainder of the guests received selection boxes.Tarbert’s seniors showed they know how to party as dancers left their seats and enthusiastically took to the floor as soon as the musical entertainment began.A stunned Margaret Henderson was named #Citizen of the Year#, confessing she never expected to win the award.For more than  years, Margaret has collected money to support the Tarbert Sea Food Festival and Music Festival.

A wee van and a motorbike were behind them at the time and they let them pass and they disappeared down the twisty road at an incrediblespeed.They reached Tighnabruaich at about  o#clock and saw Fulmar in the water, but when they stopped to speak to Johnny Malcolm and Donald Turner they were told she was not in the water more than # an hour and still not fully rigged. They were quite right but George Smith said they were busy getting Psyche ready for launchingbut they would be out first thing in the morning to bend on the sails and finish off the rigging.They got their storesin the yard and with these and their luggage went aboard in two trips. Things were soon put sufficiently enough in order to allow them to get to bed and after watching Psyche go down the slip they were soon in their bunks. It was a beautully clear evening but distinctly cold.Next morning they were up at sevenand about eight the yard men came out and finished up their jobs. Jimmy Smith fixed up the slipping clutch and suggested we do away with the present gear lever fancy arrangement which was not strong enough for its work. This the Skipper agreed to though it meant a less handy working but it did away with the pin and shield that broke up the dog-house seat, they being replaced by a removable hatch cover. It certainly made sitting in the dog-house more comfortable.The Skipper went ashore to the village for meat and some curtain hooks while Archie watered ship and the other two continued cleaning and clearing up aboard.At quarter to twelve they were away under full sail and in brilliant sunshine but with a cold north-westerly they ran to Ardlamont then beat up to Tarbert, being passed just outside Tarbert as an aeroplane flew close overhead, by Blink. They noticed a huge oil tanker doing trials just off Arran.They were anchored off the herring pier before  o#clock and they had supper-cum-lunch then went ashore. The Pilot to visit a friend, the others to get milk in the village then to walk to the end of the road on Loch Fyne. On their way they spoke to an enthusiastic English pair, working in their garden, who wanted to know off which yacht they had come.During the evening Arcturus and Tunnag came in and one or two motor boats. Zaidie was in when they arrived and Leonora was anchored across Loch Fyne in Buck Bay.All aboard, Margaret and Archie went off to the islet in the harbour to get some roots for their new garden then soon afterwards all turned in, for though it was a glorious looking evening it was perishingly cold and the stove, lit as soon as they anchored, had been very welcome.On Sunday they were again up early and found a dull overcast day. The Pilot, ashore for water, heard a poor weather forecastfrom a fishing board. On the strength of this they hurried breakfast and by  o’clock were away with a south-westerly breeze.The Skipper gave the first beacon a rap with the boom-end as they ran out of the harbour. The beat down to Ardlamontand thee ran the engine for five minutes to get out of a nasty lop. The sun came out for about five minutes but by the time they had reached the Carry Buoythe rain had started and it got heavier and heavier.The wind strengthened with the rain and they moved up very fast into Tighnabruaich Bay then up to Loch Riddon to anchor off the pier at Ormidale. As they passed Tighnabruaich they saw Torridon was on Fulmar’s mooring and they watched her crew panicking to get off before Fulmar arrived. They wondered what the Torridons said when they saw Fulmar pass on through and realised that they could have stayed where they were. As they passed Glen Caladh the new Jansi of Kames passed under a not very healthy-sounding engine.They had lunch and the stove was lit then Margaret and Archie went ashore to visit friends and when they came back they brought with them a big sack of coal . The late afternoon and evening were spent below talking and listening to the rain hammering on the deck.Monday morning it was dry but blowing hard. They got the anchor early and motored to the moorings. The sails were hoisted to dry them and St Roma came close by to make their number and at one time a big school of thrasher whales went through the Kyles heading east and at a great speed.About noon they went ashore for a visit to the hotel and for a run round the Ardlamont road . Back aboard they had lunch and soon after packed up and came home."},{"url":null,"title":"the cinema on wheels returns","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe screen machine will be rolling back into Mid Argyll at the end of the month.Bringing with it a host of movies for film fans the Screen Machine will be in Campbeltown Road car park in Tarbert from Wednesday January  to Thursday January  and Lochgilphead Resource Centre car park from Friday January  to Sunday February .Musical fantasy film Cats, based on the Andrew Lloyd Webber stage musical, features an ensemble cast including James Corden, Judi Dench, Jason Derulo, Idris Elba, Jenner Hudson, Ian McKellen, Taylor Swt, Rebel Wilson, and Francesca Hayward.Also known as Star Wars: Episode IX, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is an epic space-opera film.

So how did Britain look before human interventions  Dense forest  or open woodland Research now favours the latter.Plants and animals evolved in equilibrium for thousands of years before humans impacted the landscape. Essential to this balance were ‘keynote species’ including aurochs , bison and tarpan . By grazing, these animals trampled and eroded soils, dispersed seeds and redistributed nutrients, thereby keeping the forest open. This in turn encouraged growth of large trees while also creating numerous habitats and microenvironments for a wonderful ersity of plants and smaller animals.Now this bioersity is severely threatened by modern monocultures , and massive quantities of pesticides, fungicides, fertilisers and #weed# killers. It is no wonder that insect numbers have plummeted, many bird species are endangered and wild-flower meadows have virtually vanished. So could we recreate this natural order on unproductive land and save our wildle For Isabella Tree and her husband Charlie Burrell the answer is a resounding #yes#. In her book #Wilding#, Tree describes #wilding# their , acre farm at Knepp, West Sussex, that had been unproductive for years.They introduced longhorn cattle, Exmore ponies, deer and pigs but otherwise left well alone. Within months they saw a dference # most scrub was cleared, producing an explosion of plant and animal species. And where grazers were deterred by spiny or unpalatable plants, oaks emerged that will eventually form an open woodland.But Knepp is isolated. More rewilding sites are needed with wildle corridors between them to support the populations and genetic ersity essential for long-term survival.Surely parts of Argyll are ideal for rewilding. We already have beavers creating new waterways to support aquatic species – now how about some large grazers to open up the landscape and perhaps one day recreate the ancient Celtic rainforest "},{"url":null,"title":"hair raising happenings at the co op","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLochgilphead Co-op staff are on a fundraising mission which they hope will raise awareness and help overcome stigma around mental illness.Trusting her hairdresser Nicky MacDougall, from Casa in Ardrishaig, Tina Holloway will have her hair shaved off to raise funds for the Scottish Association for Mental Health .Explaining why she decided to take on the challenge, Tina said: #I didn#t really think before I opened my mouth.

Fulmar got off equal first with half a dozen others and the Bosun, at the tiller, is reported to have had a look of near terror on his face. If he had known that one of the yachts, Sinbad, had lost its rudder during the melee and was virtually out of control he would probably have been more frightened. Two boats, Islay and Saionara, were in trouble with burst and torn mainsails. Fulmar held her position well and was among the first half dozen boats up to Colintraive but thereafter the wind fell light and they got stuck in the south narrows and nearly all the boats passed them – those taking the north channel scoring very decisively.Down the Kerry Kyle they recovered some of the lost ground but when they rounded Ardlamont they were still well down in the tail. They passed through the Skate and this paid handsomely as they got a tremendous lt up the east shore and passed boat after boat – those out in the middle of the loch got stuck and never got going again. Seewolf was lying rd or th at the Skate but she crossed the line a very bad last of the whole fleet. A spell of very calm weather followed while Fulmar was away over at Kilfinnan but, a light air coming away, they managed to cross over to the west shore and there got quite a nice little breeze which brought them along splendidly till they reached the buoys south of the breakwater then it died – absolutely. And it took them half an hour to do the distance.Next day, in a strong easterly, they had a slow and strenuous trip through the canal to Crinan then, borrowing Davie Weston’s dinghy to save launching their own, they went straight out and anchored off the canal entrance.There was a straggling start at .am on Monday owing to there being no gun and no one quite knew when to go but followed Arcturus when she gave a lead. Fulmar was moderately well placed about the middle of the ruck. A quite steady easterly gave them a quick passage to Fladda but, off Sheep, it fell light and all were becalmed. This, of course, suited Fulmarfine as no one was moving and, as long as this was the case, she was piling up a fine credit balance of handicap minutes. She tried to keep as well up to the eastward as possible but did not quite succeed in passing east of Sheep island as Arcturus did .A puffer coming south with her smoke trailing away to the west gave them a hint which few,any, of the others took and they held more and more to the east and, as a consequence, got the first of a fresh easterly breeze and swept past boat after boat, most of which had held down to Mull. By the time they got to Duart and were able to bring the breeze dead astern they were well up in the first half and well ahead of their time allowance. Thereafter it was just a question of #Would the wind hold # Provided it did so they felt they had an excellent chance as, with the hold-up at Sheep, they had accumulated more than half an hour of handicap from the leading boats and had lots in hand for those but a little ahead of them.The wind did hold and Fulmar won the Tobermory Cup and the st prize for the second section of the race which with Saturday’s second prize made a very good showing for the weekend.The Mate, Tar and Skipper, were following the race as best they could from the shore. When they came down Loch Fyne side it was a dead calm and they were very surprised when they got to Tarbert to see the boats, half hidden in the rain, coming round Ardlamont – they had no inkling of the breezy start. In Loch Fyne they watched the very slow progress, then the rain cleared off and they were glad to see the big lt Fulmar got up the east shore after going through Skate. For the last two or three hours things went desperately slowly till late-ish in the evening a little breeze brought in the leading boards but it died and left Fulmar no further from the finishing line than the buoys south of the breakwater – she was well up and ahead of several in the big class and most of the small class. She had only about  yards to do when she stopped and, after hurriedly working out the elapsed time handicaps, the Skipper found she had  minutes in which to do them but she failed by a little over two minutes to do it. The Skipper thought she had won as he thought Vanda had been the leader up till then and it was a disappointment when, checking up, he discovered Sally of Kames was ahead of Vanda and had saved her time by two minutes on Fulmar.The start from Crinan was at .am and the Skipper, Tar and Mate got up at .and went across to see them go. The start was a bit of a fiasco as the officials slept in but all the boatsgot off more or less together. As it happens it was perhaps a good thing as, with all the boats starting together on a short line and with the strong easterly breeze that was then blowing there might, too easily, have been some nasty accidents.The Tar, Skipper and Mate went back to their beds then after breakfast went to Oban with little expectation of seeing anything more of the boats. Again they were surprised when, on going to the summit of the Pulpit Hill in Oban, they saw the leading boats just coming up to Duart – they did not know anything of the hold-up at Sheep.Anxiously they watched a number of boats come into view round a hill on Kerrera and were more than pleased when, well up amongst the leaders and passing boat after boat as they watched, they saw the red gaff sails of Fulmar reaching up the Firth of Lorn then running up the Sound of Mull. They watched until most of the boats were well out of recognition distance up the Sound then went home confident thatconditions remained as they were Fulmar had more than a good chance of winning that leg of the race and, with luck, the whole thing.Extract from The Glasgow Herald of Tuesday, July : #Clyde Cruising ClubIn the early hours of yesterday morning the yachts of the Clyde Cruising Club set off from Crinan on the nd leg of their face from Port Bannatyne to Tobermory.

The  ton cutter Fulmar, which distinguished herself many years ago as one of the few finishers in a stormy Fastnet race, won the Tobermory Cup for the large class, and the  ton sloop Trefoil captured the Torridon Cup for the small class.Driven hard from Port Bannatyne by a fresh easterly, the yachts found a calm patch off Ardrishaig, but they were blown through the canal to Crinan, where the second leg of the race was sailed in a good easterly breeze, resulting in fast passages. The -metre yacht Cerigo arrived first at Tobermory from Crinan in  secs short of  hours.Results:-Class  Fulmar– h m s Sally of Kames– h m s Arcturus– h m sVandah m s. Helenh m s. Torridonh m s.

attempted to defend their track record despite being rated amongst the worst performing in Scotland.Figures released by the Local Government Benchmarking Framework last week puts the Newtown St Boswells authority towards the bottom of the heap in most categories.With housing stock transferred over to Scottish Borders Housing Association and all cultural and leisure facilities in the hands of Live Borders, the local authoritys portfolio of responsibility has diminished over the past decade or so.But much of what remains under Scottish Borders Council control is lagging behind other authorities.As well as having the second worst roads in the country, according to the   findings, bosses at Newtown spent less than half the national average on repairs, pound, per kilometre against the Scotland-wide pound,.Although an argument can be made regarding the additional amount of carriageway in the rural Borders, similar authorities, such as Highland, Aberdeenshire, Moray and both North and East Ayrshire, all spent considerably more.Only Dumfries and Galloway, and Eilean Siar authorities spent less during  .Scottish Borders Council also spent below the national average on every aspect of education.Across Scotland the average spend per pupil in secondary education was pound,, while in the Borders it was only pound,.Primary pupil spend in Scotland was pound,, while in the Borders during   it was pound,.And pre-school spend per pupil in the Borders was only pound, against a national average of pound,.The number of sick days taken by teachers in the Borders was also worse than the national average.While spending on frontline education is well below Scottish averages, the amount spent on office-based administration and support across the whole authority during  , at seven percent of budget, was almost double the national level of four percent.Local MSP Christine Grahame believes Scottish Borders Council should re-prioritise its spending.She told us: \"I am sure Borderers will be angry at the information coming to light from this given how clearly it demonstrates the councilrsquos deeply skewed priorities for its spending.ldquoTime and time again constituents have contacted me to complain about the frankly dangerous state of some roads in the Borders and I have repeatedly raised it with SBC.\"To now find out it has the third lowest spend per kilometre on roads in the country, and that the area has the second worst A roads and B roads is an unsuprising but damning indictment of the councilrsquos priorities.ldquoWhy is this Tory-led administration spending poundm on vanity projects like the purchase of the Lowood Estate for speculative development, whilst it underspends on our schools, tourism and helping people back to work  Why does it spends so little on economic development to bring down the  percent of shops that lie empty in our town centres ldquoThere are serious questions for SBC to answer here and I for one will certainly look to see them held to account.Investment in helping people back to work was the second lowest, at . percent, of all the  authorities in Scotland.Scottish Borders Council also spent less than half the national average when it came to economic development and tourism.Across Scotland authorities averaged pound, per , population on attracting tourists and improving the local economy, in the Borders the spend was just pound,.And the figures also show that there was a higher proportion of empty town centre propertiesin the Borders than the Scottish average .Elderly care was also ranked poorly with only  percent of council services rated as good or above - the fourth worst in all Scotland - compared to a national average of  percent.Ron Sutherland, who had a successful career in corporate governance, finance and management, has been a strong critic of spending at Newtown St Boswells in recent years.The retired consultant from Innerleithen told us: \"As those who have attempted in recent times to get to the heart of topical issues, transactions and dealings will already be aware, it is often dficult to ascertain what goes on at SBC, through the barrier of smoke and mirrors around the councils Newtown St Boswells nerve centre.\"It might be thought that senior officials - of which we evidently have many - and elected members prefer to inhabit those parts of Council HQ located away from the spotlight of public scrutiny and accountability!\"However, the Local Government Benchmarking Framework provides an excellent opportunity for outsiders to gain an insight into our local authoritys performance in comparison with other councils across the country, and indeed against those with similar characteristics to SBC.\"Revelations of shortcomings in expenditure, or investment of council taxpayers money last year in several key local authority areas of responsibility such as roads, schools and education, tourism, economic and social development, etc. are unsurprising.\"There are fewany bright spots - especially worrying when SBC allocates almost twice the national average funding to administration support, doing little to dispel impressions of a top-heavy, inefficient organisation.\"This resonates with the recent eye-wateringly costly and confused SB Cares debacle - indicative of poor planning and organisational management allied to woefully inept financial control and monitoring by those senior people charged with doing just that, and paid handsomely into the bargain.For the record in the year to March , its last full year of operation, provisional accounts for SB Cares LLP disclosed a net loss of over pound. million, with net current liabilities - effectively, accumulated insolvency - in excess of pound. million - plus an audit report casting material uncertainty and signicant doubt on the organisations viability as a going concern.,params: .push\"In most peoples book, that would read like mismanagement, which would be little short of a scandal.\"Moreover, in the four years of so of employment, the CEO of SB Cares took home more than half a million pounds for his efforts and he was also employed as an executive director of SBC, in clear contravention of relevant guidelines relating to conflict of interest.\"Will anyone be held accountable \"In a statement from Scottish Borders Council, bosses attempted to highlight the amount of money spent with local suppliers and contractors was signicantly higher than the national average.But it didnt mention that only  percent of invoices were paid on time - against a national average of  percent, making it the fth worst for paying bills in the country.Rather than being disappointed SBC Chief Executive Tracey Logan prefers to look at more locally sourced surveys.She said: ldquoThese statistics are just one element of how we regularly monitor and report the performance of the council.\"Many of these figures are not new, and in some areas we believe that some of the local data we collect, for example the Scottish Borders Household Survey and those undertaken with Live Borders customers, are more representative due to the volume of responses received.\"These show much higher levels of satisfaction with services.ldquoHowever, every piece of information on our service delivery is useful, and we will use the statistics and comparison data to look at how we can continue to change, improve and invest to provide the best possible services to the residents of the Scottish Borders.Scottish Borders Council did fare well in council tax collections and support offered for looked-after children.And it has the second highest spend of any authority, at pound, per , population, on parks and outdoor spaces, with the national average being pound,.The signicant spend is down to the investment in new parks and the additional cost of staff from other departments.Council leader Shona Haslam said: \"It is abundantly clear when you look at the full range of data released that council services are under pressure across the country, with average performance falling across many areas.ldquoIn some measures this follows long periods of improvement, suggesting that we may be reaching a tipping point in how council services are being affected by the need for us all to make savings due to the gap between the funding required to maintain and improve services and that actually available.ldquoScottish Borders Council continues to make and maintain progress in some key areas, but we have to be realistic and acknowledge that services, particularly non-statutory ones, are impacted by reductions in spending.\""},{"url":null,"title":"borders-holiday-inspires-authors-debut-novel","story":"A NEW author has set his debut novel

After the session, as the children were heading for lunch, a girl from the class came up and said: ldquoI think the moral in that tale is that we should be kind, but that itrsquos often not easy to do.It was a traditional tale in which the tables are turned on a selfish rich man who had shown no compassion, but then hoped for kindness when he was the one in need. In the brief discussion with this young person, we agreed that itrsquos easier to show kindness to someone who we believe truly deserves it.She told me: ldquoI think the woman in the story did the right thing butIrsquom being honest,it had been me I donrsquot knowIrsquod have been able to be kind like her, because Irsquod have wanted revenge. Thatrsquos the problem, I think, we always think about revenge first. It can make us feel better for a short while but really makes things worse, well at least not better anyway. I try to be kind, sometimes it isnrsquot easy, but I try. Kindness is like a seed we have to plant.I shouldnrsquot have been bowled over by this, for I know a -year-old can have wisdom that many so called grown-ups have forgotten. But I was deeply impressed by her reflection on the storyrsquos message, and her honesty and integrity.This conversation also revealed the power of stories to raise moral dilemmas and human issues without finger pointing or being preachy.And she is right, it can often be very dficult to be kind. The world seems so full of stress, selfishness, anger and intolerance that there seems little space for kindness, except towards those we love and care about. On top of that, it seems increasingly dficult to survive, keep a roof above our heads and pay the bills. Kindness begins at home and often there is little energy, emotion or resources left to think or care about others we arenrsquot responsible for.There can even be a real fear thatwe show lsquotoo muchrsquo kindness we risk becoming a doormat, being used or treated unfairly. We can sometimes watch a child being kind to another and it not being reciprocated, and the temptation then is to suggest kindness isnrsquot shown next time.ldquoWe need to teach people a lesson, is often the mantra which derails our instinct to be kind another way of saying we want revenge. And letrsquos be honest: cruel, uncaring and selfish people can take advantage of someonersquos kindness and revenge does often make us feel better, in the short term anyway.But is the answer to allow unkind behaviour to frame the way we want to live and be treated  Do we respond to unkindness with more unkindness in   So consequently, cruelty with more cruelty, intolerance with more intolerance, selfishness with yet more selfishness  Doesnrsquot this mean that we allow lsquothe lessonrsquo to be that kindness doesnrsquot pay  As Gandhi is famously reported to have said: ldquoAn eye for an eye only ends up making the whole world blind.The truth is, kindness is not weakness but strength. It often isnrsquot easy and takes great courage. It doesnrsquot mean that people should not face consequences for their actions, or that people should be asked to forgive the unforgivable. But it does mean not allowing the unkindness of others to define how we are. We should not allow such acts to clip our butterfly wings.What do I mean by this  There is a theory called the lsquobutterfly effectrsquo. In this theory, it is said that the flapping of a butterflyrsquos wings could cause a chain reaction in which a hurricane could be caused on the other side of the planet. It is not meant to be taken literally, but to show that a very small act, although seemingly insignicant in itself, can have huge, unforeseen repercussions.In this way, kindness is a butterfly. Small acts of kindness may have a huge effect that touches people beyond the knowledge of the person who displayed the kindness. Acts of cruelty and hate also have the same power but all the more reason to flutter the wings of kindness so the wind more likely blows in the right direction.In this way, our behaviour is a butterfly. The way we flap its wings can have huge unforeseeable consequences, either for good or bad, both for ourselves and others. When we are kind, we actually makes ourselves happier too.So to make a real dference, we need only do tiny acts that are easily within our power, and as often as we can. A smile, a moment you truly listen to someone, a helping hand, holding the door open, trying to understand how someone feels, making a cup of tea, not meeting anger with anger, trying not to gain revenge but a change of heart and so on.This is what will truly make up the index of a healthy and happy society. And all of us can be players in this, and beneficiaries of our own kindness.David W Orr, a professor of environmental studies and politics, has said: ldquoThe plain fact is that the planet does not need more successful people. But it does desperately need more peacemakers, healers, restorers, storytellers and lovers of every kind.Great words, but that -year-old school girl already got this.

But no. This was the first in a new series, Ben Fogle: Make a New Le in the Country, and the first stop was ldquoglorious Scotland as the presenter described it.ldquoThis is one of my favourite places on Earth, said Fogle. ldquoIrsquove often imagined what it would be like to bring my own family here and open a boutique hotel.

Not to be confused with the Scottish play, of course.Fogle has a strong connection with Scotland, having taken part in Castaway , the reality show in which a group of strangers tried to start a new community on Taransay. From this he launched what has turned out to be a successful television career. From Countryfile to Crufts,there is a gig involving Barbour jackets and stout boots, Fogle has probably bagged it.Jade and Alice had a starter flat in Croydon, good jobs, two dogs, family and friends nearby, but London le felt like being on a treadmill. Alice, Scottish on her motherrsquos side, had spent many a holiday in Scotland with her grandparents, so north they came to Loch Tummel, ten miles from Pitlochry.With no experience running a hotel it was a bold move to buy a six-bedroom inn that had been empty for two years. The price was pound,, paid for by selling the Croydon flat for pound,. Although they had builders to do the big tasks, everything  was down to them.The story that played out was familiar reality show fare, with the couple going from initial excitement to exhaustion as reality set in. The first nightrsquos restaurant takings were pound.. ldquoOn balance it is a ****load of work for what on the surface looks like not a lot of gain, said Alice.There were the obligatory fraught moments, particularly when Jade tried to give his team of two, Alice and Callum their friend from London, a pep talk which consisted of clichesand portents of doom. ldquoThe worst pep talk in pep talk history, concluded Alice.Daughter of an Army officer, Alice was a practical, get-stuck-in sort. The production had sneaky ways of hinting her family were not short of a bob, as when they filmed her putting up paintings that she had borrowed from her parentsrsquo home, as one does.There was a major flaw in the format in that the programme began in , with Foglersquos visit, then looped back to  when the couple first bought the place.Since we knew from the off that they were still in business there was no sense of jeopardy. Moreover, since one assumes the film crew were not with them for every minute of the three years, there would have been moments that were missed. As Alicersquos mum said, there had been ldquolots of tears.Their biggest problem was attracting staff due to the remoteness of the location. Eight chefs came and went in three years before Alice decided to do the catering herself. You had to hand it to the pair they stuck at it. It had been tough but worth it, and they would not be going back to London.Fogle almost put his finger on it when he said that a beautul landscape and spectacular views were probably not enough on their own to make a success of a hotel.

These include anemometers to measure wind, barometers, rainfall gauges, air temperature and humidity sensors.Details of the \"innovative\" system which uses \"highly advanced\" software also refers to having structure temperature sensors for the steel, concrete, asphalt and stay cables and accelerometers to monitor any movement or vibration.But Transport Scotland has confirmed that the system is not expected to be fully operational until later this year.While the bridge was under construction in , then transport secretary Derek Mackay assured the Scottish parliament that \"the decision to build in structural health monitoring as part of the new Queensferry crossing - a first for a UK bridge - is an example of the efforts that will safeguard that essential crossing for the future\".Transport Scotland said it had considered the possibility of ice accumulation at an early stage of the bridges design but due to the \"rarity\" of falling ice incidents it was considered that the risk was best addressed through what it only describes as \"operational management\" which included visual inspections.It has been working from March to October to define a specication for the weather and ice accumulation sensor system and from early November on procurement recommendations.Transport Scotland said that came after a recommendation for additional ice sensors was made following \"extensive research and expert recommendations\" in the Autumn of last year.The agency said that the plans to install ice and wind sensors will be as an add-on to the current structural health management system.Engineers have been inspecting the bridge which connects Edinburgh and Fe in the wake of the latest falling ice incident on Monday night which led to motorists having to take a -mile ersion via the Kincardine bridge. Journey times were said to have been taking around  minutes longer than normal.Mark Arndt, of Forth Bridges Unit with Amey, said the closure was caused by a \"unique set of weather conditions\" - a combination of strong westerly winds along with snow and sleet.In October, transport secretary Michael Matheson, when answering a question from an MSP about resolving the ice issue pledged that sensors \"which detect ice accumulation\" would be fitted to the bridge and incorporated within the current monitoring system.\"The conditions that can lead to a build-up of ice of this kind are very rare in the Forth estuary.\"Nine months ago, he said that contractors had been appointed to \"monitor the issue\" saying the issue was \"not anticipated for this bridge\".\"Clearly,there is an issue with ice gathering at particular points on the bridge frame, it may be that they have to take measures to address that,\" he told rural economy and connectivity committee convenor Edward Mountain.After saying he could not give a specic timeline for when the matter will be resolved, Mr Mountain said it would be of \"serious concernwe had to wait for more ice to form before they could identy where the problem is.\"The Scottish Government has come under fire for not doing enough to sort out the ice issues.Neil Greig, director of policy and research at the leading road safety charity, IAM Roadsmart said: \"The ice problem has to be sorted urgently to avoid Scotlandrsquos showpiece bridge being constantly devalued.\"I canrsquot believe that freezing rain and ice accumulation can be a surprise to anyone building the Queensferry crossing. The problem should have been anticipated and a solution put in place.\"The problem has appeared on other bridges I believe including the Severn crossing so the engineering solutions are available. Further delay is unacceptable as the bridges unique value is supposed to be itrsquos all weather capability.\"The Scottish Conservatives also criticised ministers for failing to address the issue earlier saying that \"one of Scotlandrsquos most critical transport routes exposes an SNP government in the throes of capitulation\".They said it was the latest transport crisis for the Scottish Government, with \"new ferries being delayed and running well over budget, trains in chaos, and roads needing hundreds of millions of pounds worth of repairs\".Scottish Conservative shadow transport minister Jamie Greene said: ldquoThis is beyond political incompetence - itrsquos now borderline negligence and the general public are sick and tired of it.\"Bridge expert Alan Simpson, a past chairman of the Institution of Civil Engineers said an \"in depth\" study was needed resolve the issues on the Queensferry Crossing.It is understood traffic was stopped just once in  years on the adjacent Forth Road Bridge to clear ice from cables.The Foreign Office was ridiculed in for Tweeting the wrong bridge in a Queensferry Crossing postAnd Mr Simpson said that any Forth Road Bridge ice accumulations would tend to fall into the sea, rather than onto the carriageway because of the angle of the cables.He said cable heating was a way to resolve any issues, but that would be \"ridiculously expensive\".\"There are an awful lot of sensors already on the bridge, so it may be that you could detect the vibration on the cables [now].\"A lot of the sensors are there to deal with problems with the structure that you cannot see with your eye. I think you will be able to see the problem with your eyes in this case.\"The sensors would alert you to the dangers, but then you have the maintenance staff on the bridge, andthey know there is a problem, they can keep their eyes open for it.\"Mr Matheson defended the lack of action saying that ice sensors would be installed but no contract for the work had yet been awarded. A report on the move is expected at the end of the month.ldquoClearly this ice build-up issue needs to be further investigated.ldquoThere was an incident... which was being investigated and looked at by the engineers and designers of the bridge to try to identy where the build up of ice had been taking place ndash whether it was on the cables or on the tower.ldquoAs a result of that work, theyrsquove been taking forward a proposal to introduce ice sensors on to some parts of the structure.ldquoThat work is now at a fairly advanced stage of the procurement exercise and they are due to look at the installation of the ice sensors in the coming months.ldquoThatrsquos to assist them in recognising that when there is a build-up of ice on any key parts of the structure that could present a safety risk, they can take action at an earlier stage in order to prevent any potential risk to bridge users.He also argued that the crossing had \"given us much greater resilience than the old Forth Road Bridge. Transport Scotland said the new sensors would \"complement the existing processes we have in place\" to monitor ice and snow accumulation.It comes as Scotland was bombarded by strong winds and snow in some places, with weather warnings covering the whole of the country over snow and ice extending to noon today .The M was closed southbound for a time between junction  and  at Abington due to a road accident.The A was among the roads that suffered disruption as Dornoch Bridge was closed to high sided vehicles due to high winds on Tuesday.Rail passengers in the south of the country were facing disruption after a landslip closed the line between Kilmarnock and Dumfries.In the Highland Council area, Kingussie High School, nine primary schools and six nurseries have been closed, affecting more than , children."},{"url":null,"title":"uk-govts-rejection-devolving-immigration-policy-fuelling-independence-cause-snp-mp-claims","story":"During an SNP-led debate on migration, Tommy Sheppard, the Nationalist MP for Edinburgh East, warned the governing Conservative administration that setting its face against ldquosensible proposals was feeding the appetite for change in Scotland.\"In many ways, the Government so far since the election has been doing this partys job for it, he declared.ldquoThe opinion polls are rising more and more people in Scotland are demanding and getting behind the cause of independence and we havent even started the campaign.

The way things are going itrsquoll likely be a bridge between two independent countries.There is Sinn Fein winning the popular vote in Ireland and demanding a referendum on reunication. And Scotland is to have one next year, according to Nicola Sturgeon.Well, in your dreams.Therersquos unlikely to be a Scottish referendum any time soon. Sinn Fein is in no position to demand a border poll, while it remains a minority in the Irish parliament, the Dail.It wasnrsquot only or even mainly Sinn Feinrsquos policy on a United Ireland that drove leader May Lou McDonaldrsquos success. The campaign focused on housing, health and pensions.Moreover, not everyone in the Republic is enthusiastic about reuniting with the North. Even some nationalists worry about taking responsibility for the pound billion or so the UK pumps annually into The Six Counties, as Sinn Feincalls the province.Then therersquos all the sectarianism and the legacy of the Troubles. Unionist paramilitaries havenrsquot gone away either. This makes it all the more remarkable that what used to be the political wing of the Irish Republican Army has become a major player in Irish politics. SF was regarded as de facto terrorist itself until recently. The idea it could ever get near forming a governing coalition was regarded as ridiculous.But after this election, Sinn Fein can no longer be dismissed as a relic of sectarianism. It came top with  per cent of the popular vote against  per cent for Fianna Dail and  per cent for Leo Varadkarrsquos Fine Gael. Had Mary Lou McDonald fielded more candidates, SF might have won more than its  seats in the Dail, one fewer than Fianna Faacuteil. It was a rare case of a political party actually under-estimating its electoral support.Seismic is an overused term in politics,but this election really is earthshaking, not least for the future of the UK. Leo Varadkar, the Fine Gael Taoiseach, has been looking suitably shaken.He insists he will not contemplate any alliance with ldquoextremist Sinn Feiners, one of whose TDs launched into a rendition of the Irish rebel song ldquoCome out ye Black and Tans at a Dublin count. Michael Martin of Fianna Faacuteil isnrsquot ruling out a coalition but is instinctively hostile.The establishment parties will do all in their power to lock Sinn Fein out of office during the coming weeks of coalition horse trading. But it seems unlikely they can keep the charismatic Mary Lou in her box.This is because nationalism is back in a big way in Ireland as in the UK. Yes, the grievances of young people without housing and older folk worried about pensions arenrsquot intrinsically nationalist.

The way things are going itrsquoll likely be a bridge between two independent countries.There is Sinn Fein winning the popular vote in Ireland and demanding a referendum on reunication. And Scotland is to have one next year, according to Nicola Sturgeon.Well, in your dreams.Therersquos unlikely to be a Scottish referendum any time soon. Sinn Fein is in no position to demand a border poll, while it remains a minority in the Irish parliament, the Dail.It wasnrsquot only or even mainly Sinn Feinrsquos policy on a United Ireland that drove leader May Lou McDonaldrsquos success. The campaign focused on housing, health and pensions.Moreover, not everyone in the Republic is enthusiastic about reuniting with the North. Even some nationalists worry about taking responsibility for the pound billion or so the UK pumps annually into The Six Counties, as Sinn Feincalls the province.Then therersquos all the sectarianism and the legacy of the Troubles. Unionist paramilitaries havenrsquot gone away either. This makes it all the more remarkable that what used to be the political wing of the Irish Republican Army has become a major player in Irish politics. SF was regarded as de facto terrorist itself until recently. The idea it could ever get near forming a governing coalition was regarded as ridiculous.But after this election, Sinn Fein can no longer be dismissed as a relic of sectarianism. It came top with  per cent of the popular vote against  per cent for Fianna Dail and  per cent for Leo Varadkarrsquos Fine Gael. Had Mary Lou McDonald fielded more candidates, SF might have won more than its  seats in the Dail, one fewer than Fianna Faacuteil. It was a rare case of a political party actually under-estimating its electoral support.Seismic is an overused term in politics,but this election really is earthshaking, not least for the future of the UK. Leo Varadkar, the Fine Gael Taoiseach, has been looking suitably shaken.He insists he will not contemplate any alliance with ldquoextremist Sinn Feiners, one of whose TDs launched into a rendition of the Irish rebel song ldquoCome out ye Black and Tans at a Dublin count. Michael Martin of Fianna Faacuteil isnrsquot ruling out a coalition but is instinctively hostile.The establishment parties will do all in their power to lock Sinn Fein out of office during the coming weeks of coalition horse trading. But it seems unlikely they can keep the charismatic Mary Lou in her box.This is because nationalism is back in a big way in Ireland as in the UK.

As Mayor of London, he was responsible for wasting pound million on the London Garden Bridge project but, as ever, he denied culpability and arrogantly refused to be held accountable or show any concern for a massive waste of public funds.Like President Trumps much-vaunted proposed wall with Mexico, the Prime Minister realises that appearances are everything and it is prudent to feed the media with headlines that sidetrack them and the public from more sinister or negative developments in government. There will never be an HS link to Scotland nor a tunnel or bridge between Scotland and Ireland.

Little  needs to be said. Sorry, Catriona Stewart, your article came second . The Johnston Cummings ersionary tactic to ensure that the Jocks have something to argue about when the big boys announce that they will be spending pound billion-plus on the HS project to make the London to Manchester route a bit faster. Far from geographically re-balancing the economy, HS encourages yet again the centrality of London. As for it reaching Scotland, forget it. Our financial contribution will, of course, not be forgotten. The big boys in Number  will have calculated that they can spin the fantasy Irish bridge story for a few years to counter any complaints.At a time when we desperately need massive investment in engineering projects to achieve our climate emergency targets, money and resources are going into a scheme whose net environmental benefits will range from marginal to negative. The resources need to go into the transformation of public transport, renewable energy generation, thousands of district heating facilities, housing re-fitting, extensive hydroponic horticulture. Instead of promoting this work, the best our Westminster rulers will offer Scotland are cynical gimmicks.Isobel Lindsay, Biggar.It is  miles to access the M at Gretna along the single-carriageway A, one of the worst and most frequently blocked roads in Scotland. The alternative approach is  miles from the end of the M A at Ayr, a route I suffered to make a crossing to Larne in June in my  Sunbeam. The even dafter alternative seemingly proposed is a tunnel from Kintyre to be linked to Glasgow by a new -mile railway. I venture to suggest that upgrading the A and A to provide usable links to the current ferries would be a more beneficial way to spend the pound billion which seems to be sloshing about the Treasury. It must be remembered that the Channel Tunnel enjoyed virtually ideal geological conditions on its route.While I am on the subject of linking Scotland to places other than England, could an EU enthusiast SNP member suggest a reason for the failure to re-instate the Rosyth-Zeebrugge ferry, other than reluctance to engage in a third ferry building fiasco  I used that ferry three times when it was operating and had conversations with the truck drivers using it to take Scottish seafood to Paris restaurants.

How  can the Chinese steel be delivered to the building site John Dunlop, Ayr.I NOTE more closures to the Queensferry Crossing, a bridge the SNP claimed would never close due to its advanced design and its wind shielding. Unfortunately it forgot that the existing Forth Road Bridge had to close from a build-up of ice on the cables numerous times. Here again it seems to have reinvented the square wheel.This crossing sits in one of the most exposed areas in Scotland and is wide open to the extreme weather with virtual open sea conditions. Add to this its towers are m into the sky, thus suffering more of the extremes of weather. It would not have taken a genius to work out that a higher longer bridge would suffer more from ice build-up than the Forth Road Bridge.This is another waste of taxpayers money, an ego project by the SNP that is totally unsuitable for its location and has already reached its capacity two years after opening, just like the hospitals in Edinburgh and Glasgow we are paying for and cannot use and the ferries the SNP nationalised when it claimed it could run them better, that will never sail.\"John R T Carson, South Queensferry.WHEN is a bridge not a bridge  When it is built by an SNP Government that seemed to forget we get not only high winds but also snow, sleet, rain and ice.

The Queen Mother herself oversaw the transformation of the gardens and grounds and painstakingly cultivated her favourite rose, the Albertine, which now flowers in abundance there.It is said that the castle on the very edge of northern Scotland near John O Groats was where the Queen Mother was at her happiest. It was the only home she ever owned, bought just months after she was widowed, and she spent at least five weeks there every year until , when she was  years old. She died the following year.: Volunteers on mission to save butterflies by tending peat bogsKeen gardener Prince Charles now spends a week at the castle every year and works closely with trustees to extend the castles growing season for the benefit of early visitors, as well as being president of the castle and gardens trust.Gardener and broadcaster Alan Titchmarsh, an honorary patron of the castles friends organisation, knew the Queen Mother well and donated a large collection of roses to the Shell Garden, where the royal matriarch would sit with her corgis in the afternoons.In , Mr Titchmarsh launched the Friends of the Castle of Mey with the first ever Scottish garden at the RHS Cha Flower Show, inspired by his friend and her love of her Caithness home.The castle advertised their voluntary positions for garden lovers to help head gardener Chris Parkinson all year round \"to get their boots muddy\".Applicants with a \"a passion for all things horticulture\" are invited to send their information including \"a brief background on your gardening knowledge\".Potential new gardeners must have their own transport and be \"comfortable with being physically active\".The garden is full of marigolds, pansies, dahlias, primulas and nasturtiums, while old-fashioned shrub roses and climbers form the highlights of the Shell Garden.The Walled Garden is separated into sections by mixed hedges both to work as windbreaks and to create surprises around each corner.Last year Prince Charles paid a touching tribute to his \"beloved grandmother\" and the \"magical\" home she created in the Highlands. Some described her purchase of the most northerly inhabited castle on the British mainland a \"widows folly\"but Charles disagrees.Writing in a foreword to the Friends of the Castle of Meyrsquos annual newsletter, he said: ldquoHow wrong they were. A great deal has changed at the castle since I first visited my grandmotherrsquos home .ldquoI well recall disembarking at Dwarwick Pier at Dunnet on a lovely August day and being driven to the castle. My first impression was that it seemed a magical place, as well as being a wonderfully happy home.ldquoOver the next half-century the castle, with its spectacular views and wind blowing from all points of the compass, provided a wonderful haven for my grandmother from the often stling heat of the Thames Valley in August, and a place where she could entertain younger relations and friends.ldquoIt remained out of the public eye. Queen Elizabeth loved it and was deeply grateful to the local people, who discreetly accepted her into their midst whilst making her feel very welcome.: Money, time and transport ... the barriers Scots face to enjoy cultureHe praised his grandmother for her \"great foresight\" in setting up the castles charitable trust in . \" She wanted to make sure that those who worked at Mey should continue to have a job, whilst being happy for the castle and grounds to be shared with a wider audience for the benefit of the local community\".The Duke of Rothesay apparently put the castles head gardener Mr Parkinson \"further to the test\" with \"some tremendous designs\" for the Walled and East Gardens last year.The castle has benefited from the busy NC route, recording almost , visitors last year alone.The Queen Mothers enduring love for the castle was recorded by Godfrey Talbot, the official royal correspondent in .He wrote: \"Even when she is in London she keeps regularly in touch with the factor of Mey about the progress of the sheep she has the health and herd of Aberdeen Angus cattle and the sale of the flowers and fruit from the fine old walled garden.\""},{"url":null,"title":"snp-mp-accuses-scottish-government-dithering-independence","story":"Angus MacNeil said the Scottish Government must be \"decisive and not dither\" when it comes to holding a consultative referendum -

Unless that changes, Orkney will be left with the oldest fleet and the highest fares in the country — and that can only be described as blatant discrimination.”In a response to Councillor Stockan, the minister for energy, connectivity and the islands, Paul Wheelhouse, says Orkney Islands Council is “wholly responsible for the inter-island ferry services which they provide.”He says minsters understand the “signicant financial challenges that can fall on inidual local authorities with responsibility for ferries” and that the Government has “made clear our commitment to Orkney’s internal ferry services” with additional funding of £. million in total over the past two years.Councillor Stockan said: “I am extremely disappointed that the First Minister has chosen not to respond to our considerable concerns directly, or to meet with me to discuss an issue of fundamental importance to our community.“I can only describe the Government’s current position as irrefutable discrimination against the people of Orkney. The additional funding we received over the last two years was welcome, but fell far short of what is needed to fully fund our internal ferry service.“I call on the Government to address this when the budget is published this week — and I have asked the other parties at Holyrood to offer us their full support in securing full and fair funding for Orkney.“The running and replacement costs of Western Isles ferries are fully subsidised by the Government. It is only right and proper that we in Orkney should be treated in the same way.”In the letter, Councillor Stockan also criticises the Government for its continued failure to introduce Road Equivalent Tarf on routes linking Orkney to the Scottish Mainland.“The roll-out of RET began on West of Scotland ferry routes more than a decade ago, reducing fares for local people and visitors alike,” he added.“It is our firm belief that there is no impediment preventing RET being introduced on Orkney routes, and that any further delay is unfair and will result in signicant prejudice against local ferry users.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

He played in bands in London, rubbing shoulders with the Rolling Stones, Eric Clapton and his jamming buddy, Ritchie Blackmore, who went on to form the legendary rock bands Deep Purple and Rainbow.He even jammed at a party with Cream bassist and vocalist, Jack Bruce.A visit from Screaming Lord Sutch, who wanted him to go to Germany with him as a bass playermade Jim think again about a career in rock music.His first passion was always art, and comic book art was his favourite genre.He declined Lord Sutch’s offer and after a few years ed to his beloved Orkney. Here he continued drawing for TV comics before working for AD. He was then head-hunted by the American giants, DC Comics and Marvel Comics.Sadly, Jim suffered with Parkinson’s Disease for over  years and passed away on December , .Despite the diagnosis he continued drawing, painting and writing original sci-fi stories for many years.This celebration of his le and art is dferent from other recent exhibitions, as it contains his le story, original artwork and artefacts relating to him.It also features many Orkney related pieces, rather than just sci-fi heroes like Judge Dredd and Batman.Local characters from the th century hang alongside paintings showing the story of St Magnus, wartime Hoy and illustrations from books, like The Bard of Ballarat and Willick o’ Pirliebraes.Jim’s we, Wendy, said: “I am delighted that the Orkney Museum is having an exhibition of my late husband Jim’s work.“The fact that a young boy from the small Orkney island of Hoy should become world famous in his chosen field of comic book illustration is an achievement in itself, but there were many other aspects to Jim’s le.“This exhibition gives an insight into his early le in Hoy, as well, as his time in the RAF and the excitement of being in the London music scene during the ‘swinging sixties’.“I think it is a true reflection of the times he lived in and I hope it will interest the folk who see it.”The Orkney Museum is open Monday to Saturday, .am-.pm, .pm-pm.

Since then, using successive budgets, ministers have singled out HIE for deep cuts while increasing support for economic development where in Scotland. On the face of it, this is just centralisation by another name.“The consequences of this ill-judged decision should not be underestimated. With Brexit already posing a real threat to economic development across the region, including here in Orkney, it makes no sense for this SNP government to compound those dficulties by further slashing HIE’s funding.”Shetland MSP Beatrice Wishart added: “HIE have shown that locally-based support can make all the dference for rural enterprises. There can be no good reason to backtrack on that principle through cuts to their funding.“The solution to local challenges can’t always be found in the central belt. HIE must be properly supported to continue their role in providing an alternative.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

He has urged the Scottish Government to take the issue of fly-tipping more seriously, highlighting the environmental and social impacts of the incidents.Speaking later, Mr Halcro Johnston said: “Rural communities, like many across the Highlands and Islands, are particularly vulnerable to the utterly irresponsible and, of course, criminal activity of fly-tipping.“Incidents can cause real distress, as well as serious environmental concerns, for those communities blighted by fly-tipping. And the problem is often compounded when the waste which is dumped is not removed and then attracts even more incidents.“While fly-tipping is often carried out by a small number of offenders, too few of those responsible are being brought to justice. With both Police Scotland and local council budgets squeezed, that undoubtedly impacts on efforts to identy and prosecute offenders, as well as hampering efforts to clean up blighted areas.“The importance of a clean and attractive environment to the health and well-being of local residents is often overlooked. Many are rightly proud of their local communities and are left angry at those who fly-tip, as well as frustrated at efforts to combat it.“The Scottish Government needs to ensure there is a greater emphasis on tacking the scourge of fly-tipping, bringing to book those responsible for it, and making sure Police Scotland and local councils are properly resourced to do so”.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

In , Tavish Scott and I voted to support the budget.“Since then, however, the SNP has sought to backslide on this commitment and short change the communities in Orkney and Shetland. This year, that amounts to a shortfall of £m.“It is not good enough for SNP Ministers to claim they are open to negotiationthey so brazenly fail to honour the commitments they have made in previous negotiations. What trust can anyone have in the promises they make “Derek Mackay may have had to fall on his sword but the commitments he made to fair ferry funding for the Northern Isles was one made on behalf of the government as a whole. It is one that must now be delivered: no s and no buts.”Ms Wishart added: “The principle of fair ferry funding was not only accepted by this SNP government, it also reflected the will of the parliament.“Any responsible Government budgets for basic leline services needed across the country. Ferries in Orkney and Shetland are a leline service, not a luxury to be bargained year after year.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

These are always labelled as such, it added.At football matches, Spurs fans can often be heard chanting ldquoYid army, ldquoyiddo and ldquothe thing I love most is being a Yid.But the word Yid is controversial, even among the clubrsquos fanbase, and high-profile Jewish people have raised concerns about its usage.Comedian and writer David Baddiel has challenged the acceptability of the chanting of the word at football matches.In , he and his brother Ivor made a short film, ldquoThe Y-word, that featured footballers saying use of the word was racist and offensive.In December, Tottenham Hotspur released the results of a poll on ldquothe Y-word that received more than , responses.It revealed that % of respondents use the Y-word ldquoregularly in a footballing context, while only % would use it outside of this context.Some % acknowledged the word can be considered a racist term against a Jewish person and nearly a half of respondents wanted supporters to abandon or use it less in chants.In a commentary on the wordrsquos historic links, the club said ldquothe Y-word was historically adopted by Spurs fans as a defence mechanism in order to lsquoownrsquo the term and thereby deflect anti-Semitic abuse at that time in the s.But it added that the poll responses indicated that few believed use of the word was effective in deflecting such abuse.A club spokesman said on Wednesday: ldquoAs a club we have never accommodated the use of the Y word on any club channels or in club stores and have always been clear that our fanshave never used the term with any intent to cause offence.ldquoWe find the Oxford English Dictionaryrsquos definition of the word misleading given it fails to distinguish context and welcome their clarication.A spokesman for the Community Security Trust, a charity working to protect British Jews from anti-Semitism, said: ldquoThe OED have introduced several Jewish-related terms, so it is important that those which are anti-Semitic or otherwise offensive are clearly marked as such.ldquoUltimately, it is some Spurs fans, not the OED, that have brought this racist term to wider public attention and potential use.copy -.

The SNP must realise it#s time for radical change, writes Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard.This Scottish Budget is one of the most signicant in years. This year, the Scottish Parliament has the chance to vote for a budget that will deliver the investment Scotland badly needs and bring about real change in our county.In the last few weeks, we have seen the cost of years of mismanagement and timidity. December’s AE waiting times were the worst on record. The number of homelessness deaths in Scotland is rising sharply and the rate is the highest in the UK. Scotland’s schools are slipping down the international rankings and there is to be a full and extensive review of the SNP’s botched implementation of Curriculum for Excellence conducted by the OECD .Unfortunately, while there is so much at stake determining the future of our country, the Derek Mackay scandal has overshadowed much of Thursday’s important debate on the Budget statement. Derek Mackay’s actions are nothing short of predatory and everyone at Scottish Labour sends their support to the schoolboy involved, his family, and the family of Derek Mackay.:Derek Mackay scandal will not bring down SNP - Brian Monteith: SNP urged to ‘remove independence roadblock’ to get budget through HolyroodSuch heinous acts by a man in a position of power and privilege are entirely intolerable. It is right that Derek Mackay has resigned from the Cabinet and it is right that the SNP have removed the whip, but the nature of his actions mean he is not fit to hold public office – he should go and go now.The long-awaited Budget statement, as presented by Kate Forbes on Thursday afternoon, was deeply disappointing. Though not without some positives such as the Scottish Child Payment which I have called for many times, the statement clearly showed the SNP has no intention of breaking with the timidity of the last  years and delivering the investment Scotland badly needs.Yawning financial black holeThat the SNP intends to use its resource-borrowing powers to borrow £ million in order to plug the £ billion financial blackhole is deeply troubling. This is money that must be paid back and the SNP need to come clean with the parliament and the people of Scotland and explain exactly where they intend to make the cuts that would be needed to pay this money back. Throwing good money after bad in order to try to plug the yawning fiscal black hole is not only unworkable, but irresponsible. Scottish Labour is willing to work with the Government, but onlythey commit to free bus travel for under-s that will promote public transport usage and break down barriers to opportunity provide a fair deal for our hard-pressed local authorities and take decisive action in response to the climate crisis.So far, the indication is that the SNP will not commit to free bus travel for under-s nor provide further and higher education with the resources they need after years of under-investment.The Government’s proposals for local authority funding have received deservedly short shrt from councillors and Cosla, whose president, Alison Evison, has said that in reality this Budget means local government faces “a cut to services, a cut to local jobs, a cut to the work councils do to tackle child poverty and respond to climate change”.The Budget as proposed also makes for dire reading on the subject of higher education. After a decade of cuts and neglect, it offers nothing of any substance to Scotland’s universities. Students too, who are now burdened with record levels of debt, have little reason to celebrate this Budget. As the president of the National Union of Students Scotland, Liam McCabe, has said, “Despite the rising cost-of-living, the support on offer to Scotland’s students remains largely unchanged, leaving them increasingly out of pocket and many struggling to get by, especially the most disadvantaged.” Nicola Sturgeon once said “judge me on education”. Well, the NUS have judged her and her Government, and it’s failing marks for the SNP.Tories offer to back SNPThe alternatives to a Scottish Labour-backed budget are either unpalatable or unthinkable. The Scottish Green Party, who have dutully helped pass the last four Scottish Budgets, have rediscovered their environmental zeal and have decided that they cannot back a Budget that has failed to provide a coherent or strong response to the climate crisis and has been described as “… more timid tinkering at the edges” by Friends of the Earth Scotland.The Scottish Tories, who helped pass the SNP’s Budgets between  and , have offered to lend the SNP their support this time around, but on condition that the SNP legislate for lower taxes. The SNP have made it clear that they will not lower taxesand so this scenario, quite apart from the constitutional animus, looks unlikely. The Liberal Democrats have said they will under no circumstances support any Budget proposed by the SNP.The option the SNP has is this: will they join with the Tories in passing a harmful and damaging budget or will they work constructively with Scottish Labour  It doesn’t have to be like this. Over the coming weeks, Scottish Labour will be fighting for the change we want to see and making the case for our transformative policies to the Government. We have a chance to turn the page on years of under-investment and SNP smoke and mirrors. Scottish Labour will fight for our proposals with the courage of our convictions.Our NHS is in crisis, with social care on the brink. Our education system is failing school pupils and leaving students burdened with eye-watering levels of debt. Our planet is on the verge of ecological disaster. This Budget has so far entirely failed to meet the needs and demands of the day. It is high time the SNP had a long, hard look at the contrast between timidity of their proposals and the need for radical change that exists in our society. After  years of SNP mismanagement and timidity, it is time for investment and time for real change.Richard Leonard is the leader of Scottish Labour and an MSP for Central Scotland©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"cop26 uk government found alternative london venue for glasgow summit","story":"The ExCeL centre in East London was sounded out as a possible fallback option to host COP amid a row between the UK and Scottish governments over the organisation of the conference, particularly the cost of policing and the availability of venue space.News of the rt broke into the open this month with the sacking of summit president Claire Perry, who then wrote an extraordinary letter attacking both governments over their conduct.Ms Perry revealed that Boris Johnson had threatened to move the event away from Glasgow over the row, and claimed he had rejected a suggestion that Nicola Sturgeon be given a formal role by calling her ldquothat bloody Wee Jimmy Krankie woman - something Downing Street denies.At a conference in London yesterday to mark the build-up to COP, Nicola Sturgeon called for a ldquoreset in relations and said it was ldquovital that ldquosquabbles between the two governments do not get in the way of the event being a success.ldquoItrsquos normal for an event of this magnitude to have contingency measures, a source told the Financial Times. ldquoWe are pretty committed to Scotland.Scottish Green leader Patrick Harvie said: ldquoGlasgow has the infrastructure and venue to host the COP international summit.

Here’s how those names were selected - and who chooses them.Read More: Storm Dennis: Here’s when heavy rain and strong winds will hit Scotland Why do storms have names While the US has been naming its storms since the s, the UK only adopted the practice in .Not all storms are given names – only those big enough to cause signicant damage. This means that only those prompting amber warningsor red warningsare given names.The aim of naming storms is to raise awareness of them and draw attention to the potential dangers they pose.Giving a storm a name also holds the added benefit of making it easier for people to follow the storm’s progress via news updates and social media.It’s hoped this will make people more likely to take cautionary action to keep themselves safe during periods of severe weather.Who is responsible for naming storms In the UK, the Met Office is responsible for selecting each storm’s name, although they have asked members of the public to make suggestions as well.The  campaign called #NameOurStorms prompted more than , suggestions in its very first year, providing a erse list of potential names.Suggestions are also taken from the Met Office’s Irish counterpart, Met Eireann. This year, they have also teamed up with the Dutch weather organisation, Royal Netherlands Meteorological Instituteto provide the most eclectic list yet.How are the names chosen Once names have been submitted by the public, the Met Office takes the most popular entries to form a list, with one name beginning with each letter of the alphabet.They then move though the list in alphabetical order, alternating between male and female names as they go – that’s why Ciara was followed by Dennis this year.Storms with typically female names have been found to cause more deaths than those with male ones, a  study of American hurricanes found. The study’s co-author, University of Illinois professor Sharon Shavitt said that the behaviour associated with each gender makes “a female-named hurricane, especially one with a very feminine name such as Belle or Cindy, seem gentler and less violent” to many people. However when a storm hits the US before crossing the Atlantic to arrive on UK shores, the Met Office will simply continue to use the name assigned to it by America’s National Weather Service, so as to avoid the confusion of having storms with multiple names.The Met Office also skips over the letters Q, U, X, Y and Z simply because finding names beginning with them is too dficult. Soyou are aZoe or a Quinn then sadly you may never get to share your name with a storm.Finally, they reject any names which have been retired following especially destructive storms in the Atlantic, North Pacic, Australian, South-West Indian, such as Maria - the Puerto Rican storm which killed over , people in . The Met Office also rejects names which are not “proper names” and these ones have been disregarded on that basis: Apocalypse, Baldrick, Big Boss, Bluetooth, Forkbeard, Gnasher, Hot Brew, Megatron, Noddy, root ripper, Stormageddon, Ssswetcaroline, Vader, Voldermort and branch wobbler.Although many Scots may fondly recall ’s“Hurricane Bawbag”, that storm was officially designated Cyclone Friedhelm by the Free University of Berlin - although the Scottish alternative did become of the top-trending Twitter hashtags in the world at the time.

I already knew that the library held old copies of newspapers from previous research but I was unaware of the sheer volume of information available, and the fact that the library holds documents dating back to the early s.The open day allowed members of the public to come in, ask questions, get to know the department and find out how to use the resources to discover their family history and also the story of Ballymena‘ was like years ago’s growth as a town.The Heritage Collection will mean dferent things to dferent people. Some will have a purpose for their search, such as finding a long lost relative or tracing a map of their home area from years gone by. Others will simply visit and get lost in the vast records, pictures and resources on offer.As a bit of a history buff, I was transported back to my university and school days as Daniel Brown, the senior library assistant for the Heritage Department spoke of some of the hidden treasures within the library.He said past records of the old workhouse are available, giving an extraordinary insight into who was actually in the dreaded facility down through the years, and also into the meetings held by some of the officers.We have artefacts dating back hundreds of years. Some are very valuable to us today, such as a complete map of the original Adair estate from  as much can be learned from this. We also have lots of interesting memorabilia including war rationing books and images of the Queens visit to Ballymena after her coronation.Daniel, who has a personal interest in history, really enjoys showing people around the department, whether they be locals or from further afield.He told me: Weve had many tourists come in, especially Americans who are keen to learn more about their ancestry and research old family names. Its interesting looking back and helping people discover where they come from!You can also trace old church history through births, deaths and marriages, communion and membership rolls and even church offerings.It was down this path that I met Mary Carson and Anne McCaughey as they browsed through the pew rental records of Buckna Presbyterian Church dating back to .Both ladies are members of the Broughshane History Society and were looking through the old records searching for ious recognisable names, however their inidual interest in local and family history was not hard to see.Mary spoke about tracing her family tree and how her curiosity was fuelled by seeing two old pictures of her grandparents at her aunt’s house.She followed rthe trail to a local heritage collection where she was able to find out through old newspapers that her grandfather’s death had made front page news many years before.Her search also revealed that a family member she always believed to be her uncle actually turned out to be her cousin!Researching and delving into the past is so interesting in my opinion, and can also be rewarding, Mary told me. I have found out that Im related to, so many people I didnt know about.Anne agreed, and was full of praise for the resources available in the library. She recalled happy times of listening to older family members talk about the past but said it is often not like that today.Today the younger generation dont seem to be as interested. They are busy working on phones or listening to their earphones that they dont seem to care whats going on around them or what has went before, so they are going to have to depend on information and places like this library to trace their past.As I left them to their church history search, my eyes were drawn to the vast arrays of cases containing maps along a wall.Here there are ordnance survey maps from the s right up to the s. There are also Grfith valuation maps for Co. Antrim and Co. Londonderry as well as th century town plans and local government maps - it really is a local history lovers dream!There are far too many resources to list, but some that need a mention include the vast photograph collection from around Co. Antrim as well as multiple information packs on local schools, people and places all arranged by location and subject.Two of the special collections housed in Ballymena library is the Langford Lodge Collection and the  census for parishes in Co. Antrim.The Collection Officer for the library is Maria Diamond, who is always on hand to direct the public to what they are looking for.She was keen to point out the many online resources made available by the library, so as your search doesnt have to end when you go home!Family history and researching your ancestry has really taken off in the last few years, Maria told me.Therefore we have listed many online resources that can help people trace their history in their own time, or when the library may be closed.Maria enjoys her job, and said she has noticed an increase in the number of people using the department.We are generally a busy department, and we try to always be on hand to help guide people to their desired field of study.“We also enjoy welcoming groups and school classes to the Heritage Collection and tailor the activities to their age or field of study. We have lots of resources for children, and a wealth of information on the local area and how it was affected during major events in history, such as the two world wars or the famine. Teachers or groups just need to get in touch to arrange a visit.I was thoroughly impressed by my visit to the local studies department.Yes, I knew alot of information was available, however I was overwhelmed by the sheer volume of resources, how far back it dated and the way in which it was displayed.No matter what period you are interested in, or what local area there is sure to be some information that will aid your study.My visit to the Cultural heritage open day may have been for business, but my next visit to discover Ballymena of old will more than likely be for pleasure!

He attended St Mary’s Primary School in Portglenone and St Louis Grammar School in Ballymena.Speaking about his early involvement in music, he said: My parents didn’t play but they sent all of us to music and dancing for years and drove us to lessons and events every night of the week, I owe them a lot for that. They had a keen interest and were very supportive.I was sent to the local Comhaltas Ceoltoacuteiriacute Eacuteireannbranch in Portglenone when I was around .I started tin whistle classes with the late John Kennedy first, then progressed onto the button accordion with Tommy Doherty.My parents then started taking us to The Crosskey’s Inn every week for sessions and I also joined the Comahltas branch there too.That place had a huge effect on me, there were great musicians there of all ages and they really helped cultivate my interest growing up. I still go there when I can.As part of the Crosskeys Comhaltas we won many All-Irelands. We had a great gang at the time along with dedicated parents that were also passionate about the music.Going to the Fleadhs was as much about socialising with other kids in music as it was competing. We got up to all sorts of ilment that I won’t get into here!I started on the tin whistle, moved to button accordion then started to teach myself guitar when I was . I quickly became obsessed with the guitar.Its such a versatile instrument and one that you can literally play or learn any style of music on.From playing the guitar I was able to give a few other stringed instruments a go - bouzouki, tenor guitar, bass, electric guitar.Its not a big stretch to adapt the same skills on guitar over to other instruments, and its nice to have dferent colours available, especially when writing.Sometimes I write on the piano - because I’m not great at playing piano, you’re forced to think dferently and that can work in your favour.In terms of my influences, for the accordion it would be Mairtin OConnor or Dermot Byrne. For the guitar, its harder to narrow it down, but three that stand out are Arty Mc Glynn, Steve Cooney and John Doyle. My own style is probably some hybrid mix of those three.I have worked with Grammy nominated fiddler Liz Carroll, folk singer Karan Casey, Duke Special, Liam O’Maonlaiand Bela Fleck.I am involved with ‘Ulaid’ with John Mc Sherry and Donal O’Connor, and Scottish group ‘Fiddlers Bid’. As a guitar player I regularly work with a lot of other traditional bands including Lunasa, Flook, Buille, and the Mairtin O’Connor Band.BEOGABeoga was formed while Seaacuten was a pupil at St Louis Grammar School.He continued: At St Louis, I was involved with the Traditional Group the whole time I was there.Frank Cassidy directed it and was always very encouraging. We competed in ‘Slogadh’ competitionsand had great craic travelling around to the dferent competitions.Beoga was formed around this time and the teachers were very understanding about me missing days here and there to play gigs.I used to go to the States for these long weekends and be catching up on school work on the plane home.Whilst at St Louis I never actually studied music as an option. I didn’t have a classical background and for some reason never thought it would be a viable career option!Whilst studying for my A levels, I started to become really obsessed with music and decided that was it - I couldn’t even think about doing anything .Up until that point I was looking at careers in IT. I heard about a new course in University of Limerick offering a degree in Irish music, that didn’t require A level music, you just had to go for an interview and perform.I got in anyway and I met Niamh there. We were in the same class and became big pals and she ended up joining the band.She’s an amazing fiddle player and singer and I’m lucky to have found her!ED SHEERANBeoga have been together for around  years and they have been afforded the opportunity to travel the world doing what they love.Seaacuten said: We’ve toured a lot around Europe and North America but have also been lucky to tour in more exotic places like Japan, Australia and Russia. We’re travelling a bit less now, thankfully, but at one stage I was definitely seeing more of the band than my own family.One of the biggest audiences the band have performed to was a , strong crowd at the Glastonbury festival in  alongside Ed Sheeran.Sheeran, whose grandparents hail from the Emerald Isle, is well-known for his love of Irish traditional and folk music, even recording a version of The Parting Glass.He has said that one of his earliest musical memories is listening to the Irish Heartbeat album by Van Morrison and The Chieftains and he is also a fan of The Bothy Band and Planxty. Close friend of the band, Foy Vance, shares the same record label as Sheeran and had been supporting him on tour. They had listened to a few of Beogas tunes on the road, and Ed reached out to the band to help with his album.Seaacuten explained: We went to over to his house in Suffolk for a couple of days. It was all very relaxed, he made everyone feel completely at ease.The weather was amazing so we were outside in the garden a lot. We played on four tracks and two made it to the album so we’re delighted.One of them, ‘Galway Girl’, came about just jamming in the garden outside the studio. He was completely sound, we stayed in his house and had a few beers and even played a game of football at one stage.Working with Ed has presented a lot of new opportunities to play and write with other artists.Our friend Foy Vance was the guy responsible for introducing us to Ed. We’ve written a good few songs with Foy now and will hopefully keep creating more with him, he’s an amazing singer and an even more amazing songwriter and is finally being recognised as such.We’ve also worked with Johnny McDaid on the songwriting and production side of things, although he’s been crazy busy since Snow Patrol started touring again.Just recently we’ve been writing a bit with Cormac Neeson from ‘The Answer’. The collaborations are really exciting to me, you just don’t know whats going to come out of a writing session but that buzz of finishing the day with a song is a real high.Seaacuten believes there is a great local traditional music scene stating: I think traditional music is stronger than ever.He encourages all age groups to get involved and give it a try, commenting: If I had any advice, it would be to not to get too worked up about competitions and instead focus more on the social side of the music.While competitions can be good to focus on something, it can put a lot of unnecessary pressure on kids.In his rare free time, Seaacuten has a purpose built recording studio in Portglenone called Bannview Studios.He has been recording for about  years and recently moved into his current space about five years ago.He said:I regularly engineer and produce other artists here, so that keeps me busy outside of the bands schedule.Beoga will be releasing a new album in the Spring. It will include singles released over the last few months along with some new songs and instrumentals that the group have been working on over the last year.Beogas latest release is called ‘Make a Mark’ and features Co. Down singer Ryan Mc Mullan.

I’ve written about music and been to a lot of concerts over the years. The list below is typical of the tracks that stand out in my memory. I haven’t mentioned the Small Faces or Bruce Springsteen, SLF or other old favourites. I like to hear a lot of contemporary music too. Starchild and the New Romantic for example - a NY soulster I came across last week. Locally, Brand New Friend from Castlerock, are an outstanding punk pop sound. Anyway, here goes…!. Town Called Malice - The Jam. Laser eyed social poetry from Weller, tight Tamla baseline from Foxton and finger clicking rhythm from Buckler. Classic mod. . The Highest Apple - Runrig. Spiritual Scots Gaelic song. Our wedding dance, along with Van the Man of course,  years ago. . This Beautul Day - Levi Jackson. I used to be a Northern Soul DJ and had quite a collection of original vinyl singles. I love the genre still. This track has it all: dance, clear gospel uplt, a black civil rights cry for hope. It’s worth hundreds. I once tried to buy it on eBay behind my we’s back. Thankfully the bid didn’t make it. Confession is good for the soul. . Kennedy - The Wedding Present. Indie student guitar based noise. Great band live from the late s. Still going. Much the same as Copper Blue by Sugar - another favorite indie band.. Live Forever - Oasis. Slightly later and closer to the football culture of which I was a part in my youth. I interviewed them twice for music fanzines before they were famous. Influenced greatly by the Stone Roses - another favourite band. . At Least That’s What You Said - Wilco. Existential American alternative musings. Another great band live. Profound sentiments from Jeff Tweedy.. So Danco Samba - Stan Getz. Much into jazz as I’ve aged. I love Mile Davis up to the late s. This track is gentle samba. Relaxing.. Prelude to Cello Solo No.  in G Major- Pierre Fournier. One of the most moving pieces of music I’ve ever heard. I feel unworthy when I hear it. It touches the eternal. . In the Hours - Emily Deloach, Incredible Grace. I listen to Christian praise a lot, it comes with the calling. This track oozes gratitude for the Gospel. Always make me thankful. I love City Alight songs and a Presbyterian praise group called Red Mountain.. Dig a Little Deeper - The Watson Twins. Smoky, sultry, southern Americana. Played this song driving through mid State Tennessee last year. Right song in the right place. Something like Lucinda Williams or Gillian Welch.

Please state clearly when the vehicle test is due and have your booking reference to hand. This line will continue to be open to all relevant customers within the priority groups who need an urgent appointment within two weeks from the time of the call. “DVA can only bring an appointment forward after a booking has been made on the system, so it is essential that customers continue to make a booking when they get a reminder letter.”DVA continues to do everything possible to resume normal operations and two new vehicle lts are now in operation in Belfast and Newbuildings, increasing capacity at these sites. Three existing lts in Belfast and Lisburn have been independently inspected and are back in operational use. Two independent reviews announced by the Minister for Infrastructure have also now begun and an initial report in relation to the status of existing vehicle lts and any repair work necessary is due shortly. DVA would like to remind owners of cars of five years and older whose tests have been cancelled by the DVA, that they will automatically receive a Temporary Exemption Certicate , thereby enabling them to continue to drive and tax their vehicle.TECs are also being automatically issued to owners of three year old light goods vehicles. Testing of heavy goods vehicles, buses, motorcycles and re-tests remains unaffected by the current disruption and those customers should continue to attend appointments.Customers should continue to book an MOT when they get their reminder letter.

The announcement was made by the Prime Minister today .In a statement to Parliament, the PM will announce poundbillion of new funding to overhaul bus and cycle links for every region outside London.He set out a new vision to level up local transport connections throughout the country, making every day journeys easier, greener and more convenient.The package of investment will boost bus services by focusing on a range of priorities, set to include: Higher frequency services, including evenings and weekends, to make it easier and less restrictive for people to get around at any time of day More ‘turn up and go’ routes where thanks to higher frequency, people won’t have to rely on timetables to plan journeys New priority schemes will make routes more efficient, so that buses avoid congested routes and can speed passengers through traffic More affordable, simpler fares At least , new Zero Emission Buses to make greener travel the convenient option, driving forward the UK’s progress on its net zero ambitions.Responding to the Government’s announcement today which is designed to boost local bus services, Wrightbus Executive Chairman, Jo Bamford commented: “Wrightbus hails today’s announcement which is further evidence of the Government’s commitment to build a modern bus network.“Wrightbus is committed to delivering the next generation of zero emissions buses for the UK and for markets around the world. “Whilst there is a role for both battery electric and hydrogen electric bus solutions, other countries have already captured the industrial and economic benefits of developing battery electric technology.“If the Government acts now by prioritising funding for thousands of hydrogen electric buses, the UK will be able to steal a march on other nations by building a thriving hydrogen economy with zero emissions technology ripe for export.”  "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_2741091.jpg--.jpg?1581502849000\n","title":"toll bar dancing club steps out for burns night","story":"A  strong crowd put their best foot forward to attend the Toll Bar Dancing Club at the end of January to celebrate Burns Night. The evening commenced with a lovely supper and continued with the piping in and address to the Haggis. The piper then gave a foot tapping rendition of traditional Scottish tunes. Two young Scottish dancers displayed their talents on the dance floor which included the Sword Dance and The Sailors Hornpipe. The evening concluded with everyone tasting the Haggis and sequence and Scottish themed dances.In September  people enjoyed a tour of the murals on the peace wall in Belfast before travelling to Hillsborough for a guided tour of the Castle. It was a lovely afternoon and those present enjoyed the beautul gardens before heading to Greyabbey for a meal.  The coach was particularly quiet on the way home and it was obvious that everyone had really enjoyed the day out.The Toll Bar Dancing Club wishes to extend its thanks to Mid and East Antrim Borough Council Grants Department for supporting these two events.The Toll Bar Dancing Club is organising a Charity Dance on Monday, April ,  in Carnlea Orange Hall.

However, a letter’s been sent to the family home asking her to “contact a monumental sculptor” to “make this memorial safe”.A family member – who prefers not to be identied – told us about her upset when she opened the letter.“It was a bit of shock, to be honest,” she said. “Everyone can make mistakes, but this is one that could so easily have been avoided with a bit of sensitivity and professionalism. City Hall keeps records of deaths, so obviously nobody bothered to do any cross-checking. And it would be a very simple matter for the workers inspecting the headstones to take a note of who’s in the plot as an extra precaution. Manynot most of the graves in the cemetery are family plots and somebody should have taken that into consideration before this process started. It’s just a lack of thought and care, in my opinion, and it was totally avoidable.“I would ask them now just to do what they can to make sure their process is tightened up to make sure this sort of thing doesn’t happen to any more families. I’m sure it’s happened before and it will certainly happen again unless the system is improved.”Like many local authorities across the north and in Britain, Belfast City Council is in the midst of a memorial inspection programme launched in  after an eight-year-old boy was killed by a falling headstone in Scotland the previous year.In the letter to the local family, the City Hall Director of City Service said while the Council does “not wish to cause any further upset” to bereaved families, it must “make sure” its cemeteries are “safe places” for workers and visitors.In a statement to the Andersonstown News, A Belfast City Council spokeswoman said: “We are sincerely sorry for the upset and hurt caused to the family. As part of our memorial safety inspection started in , we have written to around , deed holders. Some of the information we hold may not have been updated by relatives or family members, hence this administrative error has occurred. We recognise this will have been very upsetting for those receiving the letter and apologise for the error.”But the family member rejected any suggestion that families should be required to update information about their loved ones for the Council. All deaths in the city are legally required to be registered with Belfast City Council, which also holds burial records for the City Cemetery.“The death was registered with City Hall,” she said. “They have the information at their fingertips and that is enough. The simple fact of the matter is that they made no effort to access that information and are just sending out letters willy-nilly to deed-holders, most of whom are going to be older people. It’s very unfair of the Council to try and turn this around like that. This is too sensitive a matter to be treated in such a slipshod manner.”Askedupdating the Council’s records after the statutory death registration process was the responsibility of the deceased’s family, a Council spokeswoman said: “While we make every effort to ensure the information we have is accurate and up to date, which can be challenging given the passage of time, on this occasion details were missed. We will review the process of writing to deed holders to ensure further checks are in place to try to prevent any similar errors or upset for another family.We sincerely apologise for the error.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"familys fitting tribute to danielle","story":"THE family of a Glengormley woman who died just weeks before she was due to begin a new le-extending cystic fibrosis drug have raised over £, in her memory.Danielle McFalldied at Antrim Area Hospital in October after a week in intensive care.She was diagnosed with the disease aged just six weeks and after being diagnosed with epilepsy at the age of  she developed cirrhosis of the liver.Danielle was due to start the new drug, Orkambi, which can improve lung , after a deal was struck with US drug manufacturer Vertex.However, Danielle became ill on October , soon after the announcement was made, and died on October .In her memory, her family decided they wanted to do something and recently held a fundraiser for the Cystic Fibrosis Trust in Cltonville Golf Club.Speaking to the North Belfast News, Danielle’s mother Angela explained: “She fought long and hard all her le and we all really miss her.“We wanted to do something in her memory but had never done anything like this before.“It was a daunting task to organise something from nothing but we sat down and got sponsors who donated vouchers and prizes for a ballot.“As we got closer to the event, we worried more and more about whether it would be a success.“It was a freezing night in January and we were worried that people wouldn’t come out but thanks to a combination of hard work and incredible generosity, we raised far more money than we ever expected to.“We put on a buffet, had great music from DJ Gerry and a ballot draw.“We had vouchers for make-up salons and barbers, loads of drinks hampers, tickets to the Belfast Giants and the Game of Thrones Giant’s Causeway tour and the main prize, which was a gigantic perfume and make-up hamper from Medicare in Northcott.”Danielle’s family managed to raise an amazing £. for the Cystic Fibrosis Trust and Belfast International Airport have pledged an additional £ to the total raised.“It was a really fun-filled night and as a family, we would like to thank all who helped make it possible.“We’re overwhelmed by the result and are glad that out efforts paid off as fantastically as they did.

Last week police exposed a plot where a bomb was to be placed in a lorry intending to travel from Belfast to Scotland on a ferry on the day the UK left the EU.The bomb was eventually discovered on February  inside a lorry on the Silverwood Industrial Estate in Lurgan.Mrs Robinson said that officials at all levels were involved in a series of cross-departmental talks including the Department of Justice, PSNI and Border Force, but that she could not go into details.In relation to car insurance, DfI’s Donald Starritt said officials were working on the basis that green cards would be needed for UK drivers on the roads within the EU, including the Republic of Ireland.However he said that the UK has applied for membership of the ‘green card free-circulation zone’ which would be “business as usual”.Sinn Fein MLA Cathal Boylan said that while he “appreciated it’s early days” the Assembly only had nine months to get its Brexit preparations right.He said that constituents were pushing their representatives for answers.Mrs Robinson said that civil servants had been working for the last three years in “very dficult circumstances”, while Mr Sutherland said he felt the establishment of the Assembly’s Brexit Committee would be an effective way to “centralise conversations” around the dferent aspects of leaving the EU.Alliance MLA Andrew Muir expressed concern around “the lack of clarity” and warned “the clock is ticking down”.Mrs Robinson said the DfI were very conscious of that, saying “negotiations are due to start very soon and we hope the fog will start to lt”, however she admitted that the “outworkings may take some time”.Belfast Related Content\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland bf .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_bfea-bfa---bfbb_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland bf .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_bfea-bfa---bfbb_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland bf .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_bfea-bfa---bfbb_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland bf .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_bfea-bfa---bfbb_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland bf .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_bfea-bfa---bfbb_ w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Northern IrelandBrexit deal could see Northern Ireland in dferent time zone, peers warnBoris Johnson’s Brexit deal could force Northern Ireland to operate in a dferent time zone to the rest of the UK for half the year, peers have warned.\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming ca .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_bfdc--c-aece-fadde_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming ca .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_bfdc--c-aece-fadde_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming ca .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_bfdc--c-aece-fadde_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming ca .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_bfdc--c-aece-fadde_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming ca .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_bfdc--c-aece-fadde_ w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Northern IrelandSDLP#s Eastwood blasts Gove#s Brexit border plan as #damaging to Northern Ireland economy#SDLP leader Colum Eastwood has hit out at Michael Gove after his announcement customs checks on goods travelling between Great Britainand the EU would be inevitable from next year.

FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappThe Health Minister Robin Swann said the sector would require extra funding of £m next year.Adrian RutherfordFebruary   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailMore than £m has been paid to private healthcare operators to tackle shortfalls in Northern Ireland#s health service.The expenditure, over a five-year period, was used to address pressures and waiting lists, for example outsourcing procedures to private health providers. The figure emerged as the Health Minister said the sector would require extra funding of £m next year.Robin Swann said there were deep-seated problems across the health and social care system that will take years to put right.Northern Ireland#s health minister Robin Swann has pledged to improve staffing levels in the health service.Official figures revealed how the Department of Health has turned to the private sector.Such firms are used so patients can be seen sooner and to help health trusts meet targets.In the five years to April last year, the cost topped £,, - equivalent to £, a day on average.The figures were disclosed by Mr Swann after an Assembly question from Jim Allister.Mr Swann said: The HSC utilises the private healthcare sector where in-house capacity is unable to meet demand.However, TUV leader Mr Allister said the spending should be properly scrutinised. Taken in totality, the level of expenditure is very considerable, he said.That is money that should be spent in the public sector, not the private sector. The fact it is going to the private sector shows that there has been too little focus and attention on building up a public health system.A breakdown of spending showed £.m was paid to private companies in  , with a further £.m in  . Expenditure fell to £.m in   and £.m in  . However, in the last year , spending started to rise again and reached £.m.Official figures show Northern Ireland#s waiting lists are continuing to grow. The latest statistics showed the number of people waiting more than  hours in emergency departments had more than doubled in a year - up from , in December  to , in December .Last week this newspaper revealed a patient waited  hours in the casualty unit at Antrim Area Hospital in December.Dr Tom Black, chair of the British Medical Association#s Northern Ireland Council, said expenditure on the private health sector was further evidence of the need to transform the health service. These figures are no surprise and are a side effect of years of poor workforce planning and chronic under-investment in the health and social care service, he added.Poor workforce planning leads to over-use of locums, decline in service delivery, stress on existing workforce and long waiting lists - waiting list times that are currently the worst in the UK and growing. The use of private providers to tackle waiting lists is a costly fix to a problem that can only be properly addressed through full-scale transformation, as outlined by Professor Bengoa. That includes implementing the workforce planning strategy and ensuring it is resourced effectively and takes in primary, secondary, community and social care.The Department of Health said: Where health service capacity is insufficient to meet demand for elective services, trusts have been funded non-recurrently to undertake additional activity to further increase the number of patients receiving assessment or treatment. Trusts are expected to maximise in-house capacity in the first instance. However, a proportion of patients will be transferred to private healthcare providers when insufficient capacity is available within the HSC.The HSC has arrangements in place to ensure that the sourcing and procurement of additional capacity is managed efficiently and effectively.On Tuesday Mr Swann said an extra £m would be required compared with this year#s budget just to maintain existing service levels. Meeting commitments on restoring pay parity and improving staffing levels will require another £m.He said the   budget his department receives next month would be crucial.Mr Swann accepted he was requesting a signicant amount of additional money.I very much welcome the priority attached to health by Executive colleagues both in public and in private. We are all facing up to the scale of the challenges in our departments, he said.I certainly owe it to patients and their families to be frank with them.Please log in or register with belfasttelegraph for free access to this article.RegisterAlready have an account Log in Belfast   Related Content\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland aac .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_bdddc-fab-f--fdcf_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland aac .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_bdddc-fab-f--fdcf_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland aac .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_bdddc-fab-f--fdcf_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland aac .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_bdddc-fab-f--fdcf_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland aac .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_bdddc-fab-f--fdcf_ w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Northern IrelandHealth service in Northern Ireland needs £m extra, minister saysThe health and social care service in Northern Ireland will require extra funding of £ million next year, the minister has said.Northern IrelandNorthern Ireland GP reveals children as young as nine being referred to mental health services A Northern Ireland GP has revealed he is referring children as young as nine to mental health services.,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":Most ReadLegal firm Carson McDowell recruits th solicitor in Northern IrelandWatch: Duchess of Cambridge on Northern Ireland visit to Co Down farm#Miserable# week of weather ahead for Northern Ireland with more snowNorthern Ireland traffic and travel alerts: Latest updatesAngry residents in Belfast#s Holyland demand action after , complaints about students in four years,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleTravelSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Mid Ulster activists were down to help with canvassing and leaflets over the course of the three-week campaign, and we saw these topics arise on the door time and again.“As Sinn Feacutein’s assembly spokesperson on Equalities and Social Justice, I work closely with our Daacuteil counterparts, and John as the Social Protection spokesperson is involved heavily in this co-ordinating our strategies so as to deliver across the board. I’m delighted to see him re elected to continue the work he’s been doing.“We want to see change north and south, and ultimately the reunication of our country, which I believe is the only realistic means of sorting out many of the problems that we face in Ireland today. Sinn Feacutein have made a promise to the people and we intend to deliver change.”John Brady received , first preference votes in the Wicklow constituency as a surge in the Sinn Feacutein vote saw them .% of all first preference votes, almost double their share from the  general election. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

As natural roosting sites have become scarce due to land use changes, some species now use buildings.“When undertaking any building or development work carefully considering whether bats may be present from the onset can help reduce any unexpected delays or costs.“The first step in any development or building works should be to gain an ecological assessment of the site from a suitably qualied ecological consultant.”The community association say they will be unable to move forward with plans until a survey is completed to confirm the presence of bats in the roof space and this cannot take place until the end of the bat hibernation season at the end of March.In a statement posted on Drumsurn Community Associations Facebook page, the group said: “While this is frustrating, we have to work within the law  guidelines.“In the meantime, we are working hard to make our own building safe to be able to use for the next few months. We will keep you all updated.“Youth-club as well as other community activities will re-start in the next couple of weeks. We will let you all know in advance of the start date.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Creator, Tony McCourt, , said a similar Facebook page exists for the Brandywell area so he felt it was only right to set one up for Creggan.  Within a day it had , members and less than a week later it has amassed over ,. Built in the s, Creggan is one of Derry’s best-known estates. It has been home to an abundance of artistic and sporting talent, including Olympic athletes, a Eurovision winner, a Top Ten rock band and international footballers. googletag.cmd.push In the late s and early s, Creggan became a byword for political resistance all over the world. On the Memories of Creggan Facebook page, people have been sharing cherished photos of relatives, historically signicant portraits of the Troubles, images of friends playing on the street, tales of famed characters from the estate, all sorts of myths and legends true and untrue, and everything in between. Former Creggan residents who have emigrated all over the world, including those from America and Australia, have joined the page to reminisce and share old tales from their childhood. “Everybody is enjoying it,” Tony explained, “they’re all sharing old memories.” googletag.cmd.push Friends contacted Tony to tell him that they can’t get their mothers off the page, one of the ladies is -years-old and is “loving all the old photos so much”. He added: “They’ve said they’re getting no housework done and no wains are being watched because they’re all too busy on the page. People are talking about their schooldays and friends who haven’t been in touch for many years are reconnecting.”  Memories Tony spent most of his childhood in Creggan and lived there until he got married at the age of . His brother, Peggy, still lives in Creggan and Tony has happy memories of “great neighbours and friends”. “The page brings back good memories. Nobody had anything but everybody shared what they had with each other.” The Troubles were never far from peoples’ minds, and people had their own troubles, but Tony prefers to recall the joyful times. “There was a lot of heartbreak at that time. But I like to remember all the positive experiences I had growing up. Playing football in the street all day when there were barely any cars around. “I remember the first TV on the street, it was the Kennedy’s and we used to go in to watch the FA Cup final. I also remember watching Popeye and the Lone Ranger. “I had a bad leg at one time and I remember a friend of mines carrying me to Grianan Fort and back again.” Moving forward, Tony would simply like to see people use the page in a positive way. “There are no real rules, we’re just asking people to keep it clean and to refrain from any insults. “Everyone is finding it funny going through all the old photos and that’s what it’s all about.” With that said Tony was off to the attic to unearth a few more boxes of photographic treasures from his boyhood.  ‘Heroes’ Peggy McCourt has lived in Creggan Heights for sixty-two years, asked what the estate means to him, he proclaimed: “Creggan means community.” He explained: “It was tight-knit no one had very much but what they had they shared be it a cup of milk to a drop of sugar, or can you lend me ma three slices of bread. “We all grew up in the Creggan, most of the families came from the Springtown Camp so hardship was a way of le but they made sure their wains were fed and watered, even going without themselves. “Then came the civil rights movement, then a full-blown war on the streets but again the Creggan community rallied around those who were affected by the conflict. “So many young people were first interned just because they were Catholic, many were arrested, put though interrogation centres and ended up in prison.” Peggy continued: “The hunger strikes took their toll on many families but no matter what went on Creggan grew into the best estate in Derry – in the world. “Growing up was hard at the time we lost so many friends and family members but it was a fun place to grow up, friendships formed that still last to this day. The friends I had sixty odd years ago are as strong as when we first met.  “No video games, all street games, football, rounders, even cricket, hopscotch, all these plus many more sitting out till  or  telling ghost stories, then you ran home the living day lights scared out of you. “Creggan is more than a council estate, its a way of le, its in your blood, we don’t even have to look anywhere for heroes, Creggan is full of them they are called ma’s and da’s.”   If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

In the second half we werent clinical enough. We should have been finishing that game with -, - at our ease. googletag.cmd.push “We played much better last week than we did this week. Its old school tradition but I felt we didnt get enough blocks on last week, we didnt put enough pressure on the ball going in and today we did that much better and thats probably resulted in Tipp being held scoreless from play.”Gallagher admitted that the uncertainty in the build up to the game was not at all helpful, with the Derry boss expecting the game to be postponed after witnessing the rain at Celtic Park on Saturday night.“In the morning we probably felt that it wasnt going to be on,” he said. “It was a bit of a lottery and you could see the way it cut up there. To be brutally honest I stayed up last night and witnessed the rain. “We were up at the Brunswick and the kids were coming out and it was absolutely baltic and the rain was coming in.“In fairness the pitch improved and to be fair thats part of the challenge of being a sportsman or athlete because you have got to be mentally strong and to be fair the lads started the game strong and that didnt seem to impact them.”Yesterdays game was certainly not the most entertaining nor memorable of games, but for Gallagher and his players it was all about the result.“When it was -, - you would like to have seen us push on but to be honest I thought there were one or two soft frees again,” he continued. “We didnt push on but we overplayed the ball and dropped a couple short and maybe Alex had a couple of shots we missed and we had Sammysgoal chance and we had Dannyschance.“Those things, maybe instead of stretching the game out to -, or  or  points maybe leaves it a wee bit more nervy than it should but I suppose the boys are saying that we havent beaten a team ranked like Tipperary in a couple of years so it probably leads to a wee bit of fear.” googletag.cmd.push Important After disappointments of ious natures against Leitrim and Down, yesterdays win was important for Derry in the short term as well as in the bigger picture.“We need to have an open mind,” Gallagher continued. “We want to be better at the end of the league than we were at the start. Thats the approach we have taken because we are with a new group and we are trying to build a consistency here.“Im not from Derry but looking in from the outside the turnover in players, the in and out of the squad, the lack of consistency in selection, the lack of togetherness probably, were really trying to build on that.“We think the age of the squad is really, really good there and we know theres good talent thats come through in Derry but its a matter now of sticking together. Its a test of character and generally the people who are mentally toughest and the strongest characters win out.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Born and raised in Derry until the age of , I always had a calling for adventure and opportunity, and it was at this stage in my le I took a huge leap of faith and went in chase of the American Dream. A little Irish girl lost in the big city of New York awaiting my immigration papers is where I learned so many le lessons and character building. At the age of  I stumbled upon a movie The Secret which would eventually change my le and my direction. googletag.cmd.push This movie for me was a beginning, an awakeningyou will. I had opened my eyes to a whole new world of self-belief, ambitions and possibilities. At the age of  I opened my first business which was a Health Care Call Centre. Alongside this I worked for a healthcare administration business which was family run and set up by my mother in New York. Whilst I found great business acumen and skillset in my work, it took its toll on me. The corporate pace and stress fuelled environment was not my fit so I sold my shares in the family business and sold my own business. googletag.cmd.push This was an important and pivotal moment for me in my le where I would embark on a journey of self-discovery and promise. From the beginning of le as I know it until now, I have never known fulfilment like being a mom. Being we to my husband, Dr Frank Dos Santos, and mother to our gorgeous and amazing children and brought me happiness like no other and for this I am eternally blessed and grateful. The le we share together is precious and I value this every day. There came a point for me personally, where I had reached that feeling of fulfilment and happiness and these feelings are what I embrace and evoke everyday in le. Drawing on my previous experiences and knowledge of The Secret as well as the process of le which had led me to this point, spurred me on to find my true passion in le. Helping others. I thought, whatI can pass on these feelings that I’m feeling  WhatI can help others to feel joy, hope and happiness whatever their environment or circumstance  So, in , alongside my business partner Chiara I set up a company Joy In The Workplace whose sole aim was to bring and implement productivity and joy into the workplace. This was my fit. The gratication and sense of fulfilment in helping others became a part of me. I knew I could do this, loved doing it and I did not want to stop here. I knew that feeling of being in a corporate environment and feeling stressed, overworked and unfulfilled and being able to approach and work with iniduals and groups who were in the same position and offer them a road to productivity and happiness in their role was le changing. I wanted to do more. In the Secret Bob Proctor was the clear definitive practitioner for me. I got in touch with the Proctor Gallagher Institute and trained in becoming a PGI Consultant The programmes set by Bob Proctor and Sandy Gallagher are some of the most effective and efficient I have ever seen and I was thrilled to become a part of it and be able to offer coaching to clients in both the U.S and Ireland. I recently was promoted within this company to Senior Coach and Account Executive which now enables me to offer some of the most elite personal development programmes PGI has to offer. Working alongside these esteemed colleagues has been a huge ambition of mine and I have learned so many invaluable skills and ideologies that I cannot wait to share with more and more clients whether personal or in a group setting. As my journey to date describes, I have achieved some great things and I am still achieving and believing every day. But there has been for quite some time, a feeling of wanting to offer something back home. I often would hear stories in the news, and reports from my hometown Derry in Ireland of the suicide epidemic which has been playing on my mind for quite some time. It is with such sadness and despair that I have felt the strong urge to help in some way. Derry is such a beautul town steeped in wonderful facts of history and monument but there is a huge cry for help and I simply cannot and will not ignore this. In understanding these facts, I have purchased a building in the city and will be hosting mindset workshops for both adults and children in the near future. It is never too early to implement positivity and to teach the importance of le and its value. In addition to this my foundation for suicide prevention is well underway as I have been working constructively with a team of like minded professionals from the city in order to structure and further develop and implement this project which I know in my heart will instil a new light of positivity and hope for those going through tough times and needing some guidance. My connection to Derry has been growing as of lately and I have found myself travelling back and forward trying to help in ious ways. Myself alongside Catrina Crillyhave set up “Bee Me LTD” which is the first children’s personal development company of its kind. We will be launching a child friendly app and host Bee Me Camps which will have a fun and friendly environment where children will learn about self-image, empowerment, positivity and how thoughts create things. We’re excited about this project and cannot wait to see it develop. My journey has come with its teachings, its blessings and its le changing moments and I for one would not change any of it. I am at this point in my le where I am seeing my dreams come to reality. I am helping others to see THEIR dreams and make them a reality. My work is not work for me anymore, it is my passion and I feel incredibly lucky to wake up everyday to the le I have and to be able to share my teachings that will help my clients achieve the le they too want. It is my pleasure and my honour. The world is ours and we can think it into whatever we want it to be. And together, we are making it happen.

Leo Doherty, an Upper-Sixth pupil at Lumen Christi College, has won first prize in the Intermediate Category of the British Council’s Mandarin Speaking Competition, which was held at the Victory Service Club last Wednesday. His win follows on from that of Thornhill Colleges Eve Flood, who took the beginners’ title last year. The competition aims to build interest in Chinese language and culture and saw Leo joined by students from  Secondary Schools from across the Britain – including fellow pupilsAnitta Sibin, who competed in the Beginners’ Category, andMatthew Rodgers, Niamh Fleming, Grace Martin, Vibhav Nthanankalva and Owen McFadden, who performed in the Group category. googletag.cmd.push The Lumen Christi pupils made it through to the final after competing in the Northern Ireland heat last November which was supported by the Confucius Institute at Ulster University. Leo, who has only been learning Mandarin for two years, said it was surreal to have won. “I’ve always loved linguistics and with Mandarin, it changes the way you think about languages – it’s almost like a problem to be solved. I also like that you can watch dferent TV, listen to Chinese music and communicate with people across the world. “I was shocked when I won. There were so many good competitors and I didn’t expect to come away with anything. I was just there for the experience, and it wasn’t really about the winning so to speak –it still feels very surreal. googletag.cmd.push “My teacher XU Honge helped me prepare - giving me lots of tips and tricks ahead of the competition as well as showing me how to manipulate the language. It was definitely a lot more work than I originally thought, but well worth it!” He now plans to study Maths at either Cambridge University or St Andrew’s. “At university I plan to study Maths as it’s just something I enjoy and hopefully it will take me into some job I like. I aim to keep learning Mandarin as I think it will be useful – you see jobs in London, Dublin and even Derry where they need people that can speak Mandarin and communicate with people in China.” Dr Marie Ferris, Vice Principal at Lumen Christi Collegesaid: “We’re just so tremendously proud of Leo, as well as the rest of our finalists. It’s a great achievement for all of them – they were very professional and performed at such a high level, especially considering the competition they had to face. “I must pay tribute to their Mandarin teachers from the Confucius Institute, who have worked so hard with them. As a school, we have been part of the Confucius project since  and it’s created so many opportunities for our pupils, helping them learn more about Chinese language and culture.” As the most spoken language in the world, Mandarin is recognised as a valuable skill for young people in the UK to acquire.  per cent of British business leaders surveyed in  said that speaking Mandarin will give school leavers a career advantage. Research by the British Council has found that Mandarin is the second most important foreign language for the UK’s influence on the global stage.Jonathan Stewart, Director, British Council Northern Ireland commended Leos achievement. He said: “Congratulations to Leo on such a fantastic achievement, which is testament to the hard work he and his teachers have put in throughout the past year. We hope that Leo is an inspiration to other students to think about learning Mandarin or finding out more about Chinese language and culture. “Language learning is an essential part of understanding and collaborating with other countries and cultures. With more than one billion Mandarin speakers in the world, it’s important that more young people in the UK learn the language – those that do will find it opens up exciting study and work opportunities in our increasingly interconnected world. “In the British Council we have a wide range of opportunities and resources available to support schools who are keen to get more involved in international work and would encourage other schools to get in touch with us to see how we can support their international ambitions.”   If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The bypass is the single biggest road scheme ever proposed for the district.Roads officials have previously insisted that the planned scheme will greatly benefit both strategic and local road users by reducing journey times and improving road safety. In addition, officials are confident that the schemersquos economic assessment demonstrates that the bypass would provide a good economic .Designed to alleviate chronic town centre congestion in Ballynahinch and along the main approach roads to the town, major new roundabouts are proposed at the Belfast Road junction with the Saintfield Road and at the Newcastle Road junction with the Downpatrick Road.Overtaking lanes stretching almost  metres are proposed at either end of the bypass where major new roundabouts are to be constructed, with the scheme also including a shared footpath and cycle lane.Cllr Walker argued that the Newry, Mourne and Down area has missed out on signicant roads funding for decades, with many major schemes constructed in other parts of the Province.ldquoI believe the time has come for this council to demand its fair share of infrastructure funding, he declared. ldquoI have been a councillor for over  years and the bypass issue has been raised during every one of them.ldquoThe government department has now moved to a position with all its ducks in this particular scheme now in a row. The public enquiry has been completed and the only thing delaying the scheme is funding.Cllr Walker said he believed that with the Assembly restored and a local minister at the helm of the Department for Infrastructure, the council needs to seek an urgent meeting with Ms Mallon to seek the immediate release of bypass funding to not only alleviate town centre congestion in Ballynahinch, but provide a major boost for the wider South Down area, in particular, tourism.Slieve Croob councillor, Cathy Mason, described the market town as the ldquogateway to the wider South Down area through which all traffic must pass, including HGVs.ldquoThis not only frustrates drivers who are part of the through traffic, but increases tension and danger for those living, shopping and working in the town. The proposed bypass will run round the eastern periphery of the town with a grade-separated junction at the Crossgar Road, she continued.ldquoHousing is also being permitted up to the line of the planned new road and includes the potential for a park and ride site. The bypass has been proposed since the s and for decades local community and political representatives from all parties have demanded this new road.Cllr Mason said the new infrastructure minister must signal the start of work on the multi-million pound road scheme as soon as possible.She said that in , the then Infrastructure Minister Chris Hazzard announced his decision to proceed with the bypass proposal and instructed officials to continue to prioritise this scheme until completion unless instructed otherwise by a new minister. Cllr Mason continued: ldquoWith the infrastructure minister now in place following the restoration of Stormont, funding should now be signed off and construction allowed to commence as soon as possible.She said the tender process for construction should begin as soon as possible, suggesting there is no reason why construction cannot commence this time next year, with the scheme complete and open to vehicles by .Rowallane councillor Robert Burgess is also keen to see work on the bypass get underway and hopes that the new infrastructure minister will also formally sign off the scheme to upgrade the final section of the A between Doranrsquos Rock and Rowallane Garden in Saintfield.ldquoThe bypass is critically important to the social and economic regeneration of not only Ballynahinch but the wider South Down area, he said.Cllr Burgess added: ldquoIn addition, the A is the main link between Downpatrick and Belfast and while there have been ious upgrades, the section between Doranrsquos Rock and Rowallane Garden is simply not suitable for the huge volume of traffic which uses this busy road. Itrsquos upgrade is also a priority..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5th February 2020 Caroline.jpg","title":"Caroline’s love of Newcastle beach inspires St Patrick Centre exhibition  ","story":"A NEWCASTLE artistrsquos fascination with the townrsquos famous beach has inspired her latest exhibition.Caroline Williamson is showing over  pieces of her work throughout February at the St Patrickrsquos Centre in Downpatrick.Just opened this week, Caroline said that the exhibition is called lsquoShell Sounds from the Shorersquo.She said: ldquoOne of my fondest memories is walking down the Newcastle beach, collecting shells with my grandmother. She told me each shell could make a dferent sound. I would collect them and bring them home to listen to before I went to sleep that night.ldquoMy exhibition is a visual collection and interpretation of that particular and peculiar memory of my grandmother.

The pick of those four has now been decided after years of exploratory talks and detailed investigations. Ironically, the final choice is of a route which dfers only slightly from one suggested by the  Downpatrick Area Plan.The new road will begin, effectively, from the entrance to the Meadowlands housing estate in Church Street and will run behind existing Church Street premises on a widening parallel, into the town centre.It will emerge onto the lower part of Scotch Street, across the rear of the Town Hall building and into Irish Street. Use of the present entrance to the new Irish Street car park will probably be made to swing the road through the rear of Market Street into St Patrickrsquos Avenue and on into the Ballydugan Road.KILLYLEAGH mdash A row is brewing in Killyleagh over proposals to open a pool hall in the townrsquos High Street.Angry residents in the area have drawn up a petition objecting to it being opened because they say that area has already suffered severely at the hands of vandals.Local councillor, Mr Sam Osborne, explained that  objectors had signed the petition because they were concerned that the pool hall would bring with it a sinister element.He said people in the immediate vicinity of the empty premises to be turned into a pool room were afraid to go to bed at the weekends and they fear this could escalate.Mr Osborne stressed he did not object to the idea of the pool room, he hoped it would take young people off the street, but he felt it was being sited in the wrong area of town.BALLYHORNAN mdash Plannersrsquo refusal to allow a new caravan site at Ballyhornan will have a major effect on Down Councilrsquos development programmes for the area, it was claimed this week.The claim was made by Downpatrick councillor, Mr Eddie McGrady, who said planners were wrong to issue such a decision until a general development policy had been worked out.Mr McGrady also said he could not understand why there should not be potential for a new holiday location on the Lecale coast, where a number of such locations already existed.He stressed that in the absence of an Area Plan the council should have a policy on this.A planning spokesman confirmed there would be a policy on locations for caravan development when the area plan was published.BALLYNAHINCH mdash Mrs Margaret Atkins, we of the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Mr Humphrey Atkins, made a surprise visit to the Plessey Telecommunications factory in Ballynahinch on Tuesday morning.While her husband was at Stormont trying to thrash out the provincersquos problems in the round table talks, Mrs Atkins was having an extensive two-hour tour of the factory, under the guidance of senior Plessey officials.Mrs Atkins arrived shortly after .am and after a y talk with senior management, including Mr Harold Davies, regional director, and Mr Gerry OrsquoNeill, manager at Ballynahinch, she was shown around the factory.She met and spoke to many of the factoryrsquos -plus employees, sharing jokes and listening and enquiring about what kind of work was done.CROSSGAR mdash Sgt Matthew Cuffey, of st Crossgar Boysrsquo Brigade, has won the Northern Ireland Squad Commanderrsquos Shield at the annual squad drill finals in Omagh on Saturday.Matthew and the st Crossgar Company were representing Down Battalion at the finals, and although the squad finished third mdash three points behind hat-trick winners st Castlederg mdash there was some consolation in the squad commanderrsquos success.This very high honour for Down Battalion and indeed, has been won four times previously by Crossgar boys since the competitionrsquos inception in .Down Battalion officers were delighted at the results, and congratulations are extended to the companyrsquos captain, Mr R Dickson, and drill officers, Mr D Nesbitt, and to the boys themselves.DUNDRUM mdash The controversy over whether a section of lane way in Dundrum would remain open is almost over mdash and itrsquos now virtually certain that it will not be closed.Members of the Dundrum and District Community Committee were told of this at their monthly meeting in the Bay Inn on Tuesday night by the secretary, who read letters received from the estate agents and solicitors of the Lord Downshire Estate, who previously owned the lane.The controversy, highlighted by the Recorder last week, had flared up when local residents sensed Mr Albert Donnelly, the owner of the caravan sites on either side of the lane, which runs from Castle Hill to the junction with the Dromara Road, was preparing to close the lane.Pillars had been erected on the lane and residents were adamant gates would not be put up to block their right of way. The lane had been sold by Lord Downshirersquos estate to Mr Donnelly, but there had been some doubt whether a right of way clause had been ed.This has now been cleared up by the letters from Lord Downshirersquos estate agents and solicitors, who pointed out that the lane way had been sold but that the right of way was reserved.

Across the resort,  street lights are not working.Other district hot-spots include Ballynahinch where  street lights are currently out of order, with faults reported in Killyleagh and  brought to the government departmentrsquos attention in Castlewellan and Crossgar. In Saintfield,  faults have been reported.Elsewhere,  street lights are currently out of order in Ballygowan, with  and  faults reported in Ardglass and Killough respectively.Sixteen street lights are out of order in Dundrum with  faults reported in Drumaness. The figures for the Spa and Clough are  and nine respectively.Downpatrick area councillor, Dermot Curran, who hopes to meet with Ms Mallon to discuss the issue, said investment must be found to address the street lighting debacle.He said that repairs are generally limited to those that can be carried out by the government departmentrsquos internal street lighting workforce which only consists of five full and three part time electricians.Cllr Curran described the number of street lights not working across East Down and Lecale as ldquoalarming and hopes that the money to expedite much-needed repairs will be earmarked by the new Stormont Executive.ldquoFaulty street lights represent a health and safety issue for drivers and pedestrians and there is not one area in the district which is not affected, he continued.ldquoWhile the new infrastructure minister will be inundated with requests for meetings and investment in key projects, repairing faulty street lights has to be a priority. The fact that in the local area there are  broken lights beggars belief. I have no doubt that the number will increase before the government department can begin to get to grips with this issue.Cllr Curran said street lights which are not working in areas where elderly people and indeed young families live poses a major problem.He said a fully working street lighting system provides residents with a sense of security and helps deter would-be criminals.ldquoI recognise that the new minister will have an overflowing intray and will have to work with her officials to determine the priorities in the months ahead. It is my contention that repairing faulty street lights must be one of those priorities, said Cllr Curran.ldquoThe new ministerrsquos department faces budgetary challenges, but the resources required to deliver a full street lighting repair service must be made available..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5th February 2020 Men.jpg","title":"Men form football team to help with grief of losing baby  ","story":"THE love of football is helping men deal with the grief of losing a baby before, during or after birth.Downpatrick man Pat Moore has teamed up with personal trainer John Fegan from Rostrevor to formthe first Sands United County Down team.The team plays its first match against County Down Masters at the end of the month.Sands is a Northern Ireland charity which provides support to bereaved parents who have lost a baby either through miscarriage, stillbirth or within days or weeks of birth.Both men were helped by Sands when they lost babies before birth and admit they have struggled to deal with their own loss while supporting their partners.By coming together to play the sport they love, Pat, whorsquos better known locally as chairman of Celtic Bhoys FC, hopes that it will help him and other men find support and understanding with other menwho are going dealing with the same thing.The  year-old father of two said that he and his partner lost a much wanted baby during pregnancy nearly two years ago.ldquoOnce we knew we were going to have our first baby together, we were so happy about it and immediately began to plan for its arrival, said Pat.ldquoI expect a lot of men are the same but at the time it happened I had to step up and do all the organising while supporting my partner who was just devastated. When your partner is lying in hospital like that, all you want to do is to take the pain away but, at the same time, you have to put on a brave face for everyone involved.While the team is about football, Pat hopes that the members will be able to socialise after matches and share their experiences.Pat and seven of his friends are also fundraising for Sands by running in the Carlingford half marathon in March and the Belfast Marathon in May.He connected with John Fegan, whose family used to live in Downpatrick, on Facebook after John announced his intention to create the football team.John and his fiancee Kathryn Cole lost their first baby, Faith, at around  weeks into the pregnancy three years ago, although they are now parents to two children, Jude and Matilda.Like Pat, the  year-old knows the importance of physical activity and sport to help with mensrsquo mental health and being able to cope with the loss of baby in this way.He said: ldquoI was encouraged to do this when I realised there were other Sands football teams in Northern Ireland but none for County Down.ldquoThis is for fathers, uncles, brothers, grandfathers, cousins, whatever men who have been affected by the loss of a child.

But credit due to both Paddy and Alec for their performances against regular league players.Group four, headed up by Colin McKinty, always a dangerous competitor in competitions, but he had to contend with an equally talented player in Sean Poland, who has been in great form recently.John Campbell, another player who is in sight of a regular place in the Strangford C team and the affable Katy Rice, improving with every game she plays, completed the group.The first spot in this group was always going to be tight, but McKintyrsquos steady defence was the key factor in finishing top of this group with Poland second.Group four with Michael Carey having steered Strangford B to their third consecutive isional title, was the clear favourite to finish in first place, but would have to contend with the Drumaness No  Pat Mulholland, who has been in excellent form throughout the league campaign.Also in this five-man group were Michael Deery, team-mate Niall Houghan and Drumaness man Seamus McGivern, more at home on the snooker table, but still no stranger to the plastic ball.The games in this group were hotly contested, but in the final game of the group Mulholland and Carey would battle it out for the top place.The first game could have gone either way with Pat just edging home -.The next was equally close but, in the end, it was the Drumaness man who finished in top place with just five points the dference.The first quarter-final match was an all-Strangford clash between McKinty and McCusker.The first two games were shared, but the steady place of McCusker, mixed with well-judged attack, saw him take the next two games to progress to the semi-finals.The second match featured the Drumanessrsquo Pat Mulholland and Charlie Murray. This was easily the match of the round.Mulholland won the first two games, the next two went to Murray with a nip and tuck decider before Mulholland just edged it -. The third match of the round involved second seed Donald Campbell taking on his skipper Michael Carey.The games were all close, but the blistering attack of Campbell saw him progress in straight games. Vincey Poland had perhaps the easiest match of the round against new comer John Campbell.As expected, Poland had too much iation for his opponent and ran out a comfortable - winner.McCusker stated this competition a dark horse to a least reach the final.His opponent in the semi-finals was Donald Campbell and he started as favourite.This semi-final turned out to be the closest match of the competition. John won the first two games and looked confident to reach the final.Back came Campbell to even the score, but McCusker won the first four points of the game and held on win -, leaving Donald to reflect on a match he should have won when he held a game point in the first encounter of the match.The next match was a close affair, but Poland was always in control with Pat Mulholland delighted to have reached this stage of the competition.It was a gallant effort from the Drumaness man but, in the end, Poland booked his final place with a straight game victoryThe home crowd was pleased to see a local man in the final of the competition, but knew he needed to produce something special to beat a player of Polandrsquos stature.The games were close and John, encouraged by his supporters, did everything he could to stem the flow of winners from one of the leaguersquos best backhand exponent, but to no avail and lost in straight games.League secretary, Jim Ritchie, thanked the Strangford club for staging this event and providing refreshment throughout the evening and the competitors for their generous contribution to the charity fund.Competition referee, Peter Deeny, also acknowledged the friendly, competitive spirit in which this event was enjoyed by all participants..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/18184540.thousands-children-missed-school-last-year-due-three-elections/resources/images/11019987.jpg","title":"bandstand paddy mulligan","story":"What genre genres do you consider your music to be How long have you been performing Where do you perform What is your favourite song to play and why What has been your biggest gig to date Any funny gig rehearsal stories Who are your major influences Do you write your own songs  What inspires your songwriting What would be your dream gig Best moment as a musician so far What is the most unusual venue you have played What is your lsquogo-torsquo encore song Whats the best thing about performing Do you always perform solo or do you also play with a band What does  hold for you Any last words This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Photo credit should read: Niall Carson PA WireConsidering the -year-old is one of an exclusive group about to take part in his th London Marathon, he can easily be forgiven for not having his sights set on beating his personal best.Ken, who has been living in Strabane since , ran his first marathon in  from Windsor to Chiswick: “In  I did it again in a time of two hours and  minutes, that was my best ever time. “I’ve done  marathons under three hours but now as I’ve got older I’m getting slower and slower and slower.”Ken finishes the  London Marathon \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...Born in London, Ken now considers himself at home in NI, listing the Walled City Marathon in Londonderry as the pick of the races he has run over the years.Ken, who will be three weeks short of  when he is running the London Marathon, said: “It’ll take me about six and three quarter hours, but at least I can still do it at that age. I do it to keep me fit and healthy. That’s it.”When I spoke with Ken last week he had just finished his training for the day: “No running for me today, I went swimming instead. Only for  minutes, but it’s enough to get all the joints working.“I try to keep active almost every day, but the weather around here is often horrible, so I can’t always be outdoors.”Ken’s London Marathon medal haul. The bottom left medal is from the first marathon in .Ken said he has been living an active lestyle for nearly  years: “I joined the Army in , since then I’ve been running, exercising. “I just can’t run these days. I’m too old. Most of my training is five or six miles, walking. “I don’t do long distances now. I’ll do the marathon, yes, but I’ll be walking.”Ken lives with his we Nora, , and will be accompanied on the marathon route by their daughter Heather.He said: “My daughter will be there at my side taking care of me. What happens when you’re old, you fall over, you do all sorts of things, so the marathon people have agreed to let her be there with me. I’m going to be lucky this year to finish, but I’ll give it my best.”Londoner Ken said he considered himself to be an honorary Irishman: “I feel absolutely at home in Northern Ireland. I would never go back to England. My we brought me over here in  to meet her parents. “My grandparents were Irish and my mother, with the name of Catherine Winred O’Rourke – that couldn’t be more Irish, could it “I married an Irish girl – Nora Kelly, she comes from a village called Convoy in Donegal – so I’m % Irish now.”Explaining how he met his we, Ken said: “We first met in an Irish dance hall in London. I liked doing the Siege of Ennis – it’s a dance where you twirl around in a circle.“In  we got married. We’ve been married over  years. We still get on alright.“We’d be over to see Nora’s parents in Donegal at least every six months and they would come over to us in London. “My sister-in-law talked me into moving here in . I kept coming over and I really liked the place – the people are lovely, it’s nice and quiet, there’s cows in the fields in summer and in winter there’s sheep in the fields. My next neighbour is half a mile down the road.”His neighbour, Eugene Devine, is also his training partner: “I train mainly with myself and with my neighbour Eugene. We go off walking five or six miles together, chatting. “We get on ever so well, he’s a young guy, he must be about . Any problems I’ve got he seems to solve them for me. He never has any problems.“I’ve got another neighbour down the road who helps too, with things in the garden and the like.”Ken, who has been a member of the the London-based Orion Harriers club for  years, was involved in some marathon pre-publicity last week along with the other remaining nine members of the Ever Presents club who have run all the London Marathons since .He said: “They had us up at Marathon House in London. There were so many cameras snapping and filming, I think every television company was there. We gave loads of interviews, all the guys.“In the evening they took us up to Tower Bridge where we were interviewed by the BBC. Last of all they called me up and said, ‘now we’ve got the famous Ken Jones’. They asked me lots of questions and I answered them.”The Ever Presents have participated in every single London Marathon since the race was launched in  and the milestone th race on Sunday, April  will be special for all of them.More than , people applied to run in the first London Marathon on March   and , crossed the finish line out of , who were accepted for a place.A record , people finished last year while , people applied for a ballot place for this year.The Ever Presents group was set up in  to recognise those who had run every race and to give them guaranteed entry. It originally consisted of  runners but has dwindled every year and just  runners remain.“It’s perhaps the only club you can only leave, you can’t join,” said retired headteacher Mike Peace, , from Lustleigh, near Exeter.Ken is the oldest Ever Present and was the oldest competitor in the  event.The youngest is Chris Finill, , from Cranleigh, Surrey, who finished in two hours,  minutes and  seconds in .In  he fell and broke his arm but still completed the remainder of the race with his right arm in a sling.Ken said this April’s London Marathon is to be his final farewell: “I’ve done marathons all over England, a few in Northern Ireland. I’ve done about  so far.“My favourite is the Derry Marathon, it’s near where I live. It’s a fabulous race, the course is so interesting. They take great care of you – they ride on bicycles to bring you water, askyou’re alright.“After this London Marathon I’m not going to do any more. I’ve been giving up for the last  years, but I always get talked back into it. All my running mates say, ‘you’ve got to do it’, but I’m saying that this is the last time.  is a good number to stop at.”In terms of fundraising for the marathon Ken has taken a unique approach in recent years: “I used to raise money for Foyle Hospice, but I found I couldn’t keep going back to the same people every year asking for money. So what I do is I set aside a couple of hundred pounds and give it to the other runners. I’ve about £ to encourage runners to go and get an entry form because you do have to raise a lot of money to run these marathons.”\"\" for the newsletterKeep up with the latest news and views from Belfast News LetterSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bMVAic sc-bAeIUo dEhRfb\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherEducationBusinessPoliticsHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

The UKrsquos withdrawal from the EU will begin later this month and we have a Conservative Government in Westminster until at least .Regardless of the numbers in the Commons, the Labour Party still has to stand up for those we represent. I am confident that my colleague, Stephen Doughty MP will continue to do that.The Labour Party will now move to elect a new Leader and Deputy Leader, a chance to reunite the Party and hold the Prime Minister to account for his actions.I am truly glad to see that several MPs from across the Party have put their names forward to stand for both positions. This offers the membership and the country a broader choice.I am yet to decide who I will back in the forthcoming election but I know that I want to see a vision from each of the candidates. For me, that vision needs to be a realistic reflection of our last decade out of government in Westminster, but also a strategy for reconnecting with our voters and securing a Labour government which can deliver for those who need us most.Finally, I want to thank the staff across the NHS and wider public services for their hard work under increasing pressures, particularly during the winter period.Our public services work hard all year round and many take the sacrice of working over the Christmas and New Year period for which I, and many others, are extremely grateful.As everyou would like to speak with me, you can call my office on    or write to me at Vaughan.Gething@assembly.wales or Office of Vaughan Gething AM, Room C, National Assembly for Wales, CF NA. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Who they are will have a real influence on Welsh Labourrsquos prospects in  and beyond. We are the most successful part of the UK Labour family over the last decade in terms of winning elections and running a national government. However, that cannot be taken for granted. An unpopular UK leader could make our task much harder next May.The first and most important attribute the next UK leader must have is the ability to fulfil the mission of our party - to become a party of government again across the UK, not just a party of protest. I want someone who can implement our labour values in government, not just talk about them.That requires some honesty about why we took such a beating at the general election, together with the willingness and strength to do something about it. Offering more of the same would be a betrayal of people who need a UK Labour government and will condemn the UK [or what is left of it] to a further decade of the Tories.We didnrsquot get hammered in  for one reason alone - there were a number of them. Agreeing to the election in the first place when we plainly were not prepared. Agreeing to an election certain to be dominated by Brexit. Our vacillation on Brexit when people wanted certainty and leadership. The factional infighting. The demonisation of the last UK Labour government, asthat would encourage people to vote for us. I grew up with  Tory years in power and I know that things really did get better following Labourrsquos victory in .An overloaded manesto with some popular policies but without a key central message. A costed manesto that then had a huge extra spending pledge added to it, meaning that people didnrsquot believe that we were serious or credible one even the policies they liked. A staggeringly inept UK campaign that wasted the amazing dedication of our volunteers, prepared to go out in the cold and rain to campaign. Our abject failure on anti-Semitism. This and much more.Many people recognised that Boris Johnson is a dishonest man who is completely out of touch with most peoplersquos lives. Lots of people still voted for him or refused to vote Labour because they could not trust and support us. Our own people - long term Labour voters - struggled to support us. Our leader was undeniably part of the reason why. Blaming our defeat solely on the mainstream media or whichever side of the Brexit ide we favour isnt honest and will not help us to win in the future.I donrsquot much care whether someone claims they are from the left, soft left, centre or old right of the Labour Party. We all have a stake in our party and the countries of the UK. These are serious times and we need a serious figure who can nail the Tories and the clown in number ten.Irsquove been interested in what Lisa Nandy has to say and believe that Lisa and many other figures have a key role to play in rebuilding our party ndash first as a credible opposition, then as a credible alternative government at the next UK General Election.However, I think the person best placed to win the argument, and even more importantly to help us win an election, is Keir Starmer. Itrsquos not the protesting, or the taking part that counts. Itrsquos the winning and the decisions you get to make in government that can change peoplesrsquo lives and change the country for the better. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

There are things being said by many that we need to listen to.But, after speaking to many of the candidates personally, and asking them all tough questions - I am backing Keir Starmer for Leader. I think hersquos got what it takes to hold this government immediately and robustly to account to build a team of all the talents and crucially that he has the vision, ideas and credibility to win again.Keir joined me on the streets of Penarth speaking to voters and local businesses during the election campaign ndash and it was clear by the warmth of the reception he received that he is someone who has the immediate credibility and credentials to be our future prime minister, and would work in partnership with Welsh Labour.He has crucial experience of public service and confronting powerful vested interests for the good of the country. He acted to prosecute MPs who had abused expenses and Murdoch journalists in the phone-hacking scandal when he was Director of Public Prosecutions.We need to win back these voters that we lost in the last general election. It was heart-breaking on election night, to see Labour lose places like Wrexham and Bridgend.The UK Labour Party must get back to being a party that votersrsquo can trust. That means we cannot just have a ldquoone more heave approach. We need someone who can speak to the whole of our country, not just one region or subset of voters, with the values and vision to win.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It was our assessment that our proposal was fair and balanced and we will continue to fight for low rates to ensure we stick to our manesto pledges whilst providing a quality service.“Rate striking is one of the key elements of our role as a Councillor and we as a political party have taken it very seriously indeed. We have worked throughout the year and indeed right to the wire with regards to the striking process and while it’s our belief that we could have done more as a council we are content that the increase is well below what was first anticipated when the process started.“We have recognised of late the blight of litter within our borough and the rise in dog fouling on our pavements and parks and have identied a number of areas were council can cut waste and reduce inefficiencies so as we can work to ensure ratepayers money is used where its needed most and  channelled into these problem areas we highlight on a daily basis.“Our commitment as a party to our business community I believe is starting to emerge stronger as we continue to promote and champion our business base. We have and will continue to put businesses right at the very heart of our decision making given the signicant contribution they make to the rates base, job creation, tackling unemployment and indeed making our Borough a great place to work, and do business.“We want facilities in this borough that are world class, fit for purpose but affordable and to that end every decision we take as a DUP party whether it be popular or unpopular we have the rate payers right at our very heart.“We look forward to seeing the Council continue on its journey in creating an area that is an economic driver in Northern Ireland. The key capital projects that we will be investing in will include the creation of a single leisure centre in Craigavon which is due for completion in the near future , the Armagh Gaol project is a renewed priority and the Dromore Leisure Centre upgrade is finally under construction , these are just an example of projects that we have promoted and lobbied for . I have no doubt that these capital spends will further improve our services as a Council and will be welcomed by our communities.”\"\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Follow us onExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleMore from Portadown TimesAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bMVAic sc-bAeIUo dEhRfb\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherEducationBusinessPoliticsHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessFollow us    "},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/258/172/true/1581250884846.jpg--.jpg?1581250885000\\","title":"no one located after multi agency search of strule river ","story":"Police received a report of a concern for safety in the Drumragh Avenue area of Omagh in the early hours of this morning .

In the last few years Pulse PR has worked with clients include Applegreen, during the roll-out of its first stores in Northern Ireland, jewellery retailer Argento that has over  high street stores in Ireland and one of Ireland’s most iconic gt wear brands, Belleek. And with a business spirit which has helped take root due to her father’s own entrepreneurial background, Grainne’s developed her own firm over the last  years – growing with the changing media landscape, creating communications and marketing strategies, working with tech start-ups from the ground up and building on strong media relationships. “For seven years I had worked with PR agencies and businesses such as Barclays, Tayto and Tesco. I was approaching  and I decided it was now or never,” she told Ulster Business. Networking at Down Royal Racecourse with a pocket full of business cards saw her leave with three clients, and from that, the business was born. Although Pulse PR was initially centred around work with public relations and press, Grainne now works with a lot of start-ups, particularly those within tech – her business is also based at Catalyst, formerly the Northern Ireland Science Park, which is the largest technology park here. One of those she’s now working closely with is IRP Commerce – a £m turnover software development company which made it on to Deloitte’s Technology Fast  list of high growth technology companies seven times. “That relationship started eight years ago with a press release, and now I work with them to target retailers, manufacturers and distributors across the UK, promoting its e-commerce  at national conferences and building strategic relationships with key players in the e-commerce industry. When I started it was very traditional PR, and dealing with newspapers and magazines. Now, it’s also grown further into the digital sphere with online PR, blogging and video testimonials. “I’ve seen a big sht in how my time is spent from when I started  years ago. Although clients still value print coverage, there is definitely a demand to create engaging campaigns for social media. “Because of how the world is changing, I have had to ersy as well. It’s about being flexible and realising the developing trends, and trying to adapt. I’ve always been comfortable in front of the camera or with a microphone in my hand so turned this into a business opportunity to host events, commentate on radio or host  at tech conferences – there is an under-representation of women in this sector so it’s a gap I believe I fill.” As a self-employed businesswoman, Grainne extends her reach with clients by collaborating with freelance photographers, designers and videographers. “You have to get results for your clients. I purposely keep my client list manageable so I’m not competing against myself and I can broaden the scope of activity I do for them,” she says. Grainne also works with Catalyst on its Springboard programme as a marketing domain expert, giving start-up companies assistance when they are bringing their product to market. She says most of her clients come through referrals from other companies she’s been involved with. “Referrals are great as it means I’ve done a good job for the person referring me. I also find a lot of work comes from people I have previously worked with or went to school with. Northern Ireland is known for having two degrees of separation – this also applies in the business world.” She’s also been working with the Ulster Farmers’ Union this year to help promote the organisation’s Open Farm Weekend. It’s an initiative, sponsored by Bank of Ireland UK, to allow members of the public to pay a visit to a farm for the first time. “This is a new sector for me, but the principles are the same – find out the end user and then apply the right marketing tools to engage with them. “It’s about fitting in with a company and how that business thinks – being adaptable and working out what they want, and trying to help them grow. It’s about presenting a strong and clear message, developing strong media contacts and also working across digital and print media to boost reach.” In  years, the media and PR landscape has evolved, including how information is consumed. “But I’m still a firm believer in knowing the basics,” she says. “It’s about having the experience and the education to be able to do it. After my degree and Master’s, I studied to gain additional post-graduate qualications from the Chartered Institute of Marketing. I’m a firm believer in le-long learning. Too many people starting in the industry think all the need is a smartphone and an Instagram account. “It’s competitive, but there’s always enough business for everyone out there. You really just need a few clients and then you turn your focus to them, as well as working with others as and when they come. A few projects naturally ended last year so I’ll be expanding my client list in the coming months. It’s always exciting to start with a new company or entrepreneur. “It’s about being flexible and being aware of what is going on with your clients, and being proactive. Being a sole-trader means you are flexible and can work closely with companies, either in their office or remotely as an extended member of their marketing team. I have often thought about employing more staff, but I believe clients want to see me working on their account, rather than meeting me at the pitch and then being passed over to a junior member of staff. “There’s a great satisfaction in helping an innovative small business, which is set for bigger things, and working alongside them in getting their message out there, building, growing and creating jobs. You really want to work with them and help build their business. “It’s about building the relationships and contacts, and that’s something you can’t teach. People buy from people and I believe one of the reasons I have kept many of the same clients for  years is because I always go the extra mile and am true to my word.” Grainne’s desire  years ago to go it alone with Pulse PR is something she says is very much part of the family story. “My father Malachy is an entrepreneur, a mechanic by trade, but he’s always been able to turn his hand to everything,” she says. My sister Orla was also self-employed as a pharmacist. I’ve been brought up in that environment and we’ve always had support and a ‘can do’ attitude from our mother Geraldine. I had a baby, Gabriel, four months ago but didn’t get the option to take maternity leave. This is the downside of being self-employed, but the flipside means I can work from home when I need to.” As for the next  years, Grainne says it’s about trying to give something back, using her skills to help those who have little or no experience in knowing how to bring their message and products to the fore. “I’m still as passionate about business as I was  years ago. I’m excited to see how I can continue to use my skills to add value to clients to ensure their message and their voice is heard.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail_MM-Photo-1.jpg","title":"manufacturing month ni to showcase strength of sector","story":"Posted on Tuesday  January  by Ulster Business Economy Minister Diane Doods with Manufacturing NIs Stephen Kelly Northern Ireland’s burgeoning manufacturing sector will be showcased as part of a major initiative to highlight the strength and excellence of the industry here. Manufacturing Month NI, led by Manufacturing NI, will run for the entire month of March. It will include a series of events, business breakfasts, seminars, workplace tours, and the flagship annual Anchor High leadership summit will be held across Northern Ireland to highlight local manufacturing success stories, address major challenges as we enter the new decade, and inspire the next generation of manufacturers and engineers. The event, sponsored by KPMG, Siemens, Willis Towers Watson, Barclays, and Invest NI, Manufacturing Month NI will bring together industry leaders, politicians and policy experts, young people and schools, and other business leaders to celebrate manufacturers and engineers, and explore and discuss the challenges which face the industry in Northern Ireland. “We are very pleased to be launching the inaugural Manufacturing Month NI, taking place this March,” Stephen Kelly, chief executive, Manufacturing NI, said. “The manufacturing sector in Northern Ireland is the foundation of our regional economy. Manufacturing Month is a celebration of the great people, in great local companies, making great products used at home and around the world. From food processing and pharmaceuticals to aeronautical technology and new, emerging tech like AI and machine learning, Northern Ireland punches well above its weight when it comes to producing world-class products and services.” “This new initiative not only celebrates the people who make our manufacturing sector the world leader that it is but will create a legacy and a pathway for the next generation of sector leaders. A key feature of Manufacturing Month NI will be a major outreach and engagement programme with schools and regional colleges, focused on promoting the sector to young people, developing the crucial skills they need as they enter the industry.” “We hope to see as many companies as possible across theand breadth of Northern Ireland get involved with Manufacturing Month NI.

The revamp is part of the Department of Finance’s Reval – which is a reassessment of the rates system which businesses pay. While still a draft schedule of values, each council will also have to apply its own regional rate, based on the new proposed figures.“The Cathedral Quarter isn’t just about eating and drinking,” Gareth Neill, BID manager, Destination CQ told Ulster Business.“We have a vibrant ecosystem of arts and culture and fantastic built heritage that makes this area stand out, hospitality plays an integral part to the quality of le in this part of Belfast – for a city to be striving to attract new residents, increase our tourism offer these are crucial to the city’s success. “We are concerned about that the potential knock-on effects to the affected business owners and there’s a very real possibility it will have an impact on the price of a pint to the people who come to socialise in Cathedral Quarter. The knock-on effect of outdated methodology for calculation of rates on licensed premiseshas a potentially crippling effect on jobs and character of this area.”A spokesman for Land  Property Services said: “In Northern Ireland, nearly % of pubs will have no change or a decrease in their Net Annual Value .“Any business rate payer who thinks their new valuation may be incorrect, can contact LPS to arrange an informal review and supply any relevant information before the new valuation list comes into force on  April .”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/mip1.jpg","title":"mipim taking belfast to the world","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by Ulster Business Joe ONeill and Suzanne Wylie Belfast Harbour boss Joe O’Neill will help lead a private and public sector delegation to MIPIM – the world’s biggest commercial property event – as chairman of the taskforce. He chats to John Mulgrew about the big announcements, fighting off the competition and attracting a global giant to Northern Ireland For Joe O’Neill and the wider delegation heading to potentially warmer climates, the proposition of selling the city and wider region to major investors has gotten easier.In the five years since Belfast ed to MIPIM – an event which sees tens of thousands descend on Cannes in France for four days of real estate and development – the private and public team, and taskforce, have developed a “strong ” in which to sell the city and Northern Ireland, with hopes of attracting a big name insurance or tech firm on the list.“MIPIM is a great  for the promotion of city-wide initiatives, and demonstrating to investors and to occupiers the growth potential in the city, and the opportunities for them and that the key stakeholders are all aligned behind an appropriate growth agenda,” Joe says.“You see dferent sizes and scales of stands out there – you see some really ambitious stands and proposed developments, so Belfast has to see it’s entry point into that. Belfast first and foremost will be competing against peer group cities within the UK… but then it is a worldwide show, so you will be competing against other cities.”Belfast is leading a major delegation this year, and will also be joined by representatives from other Northern Ireland councils, including those that are part of the Belfast Region City Deal, such as Mid  East Antrim. That deal is also going to be a focus for announcements and development, during the event.This year’s delegation will be led by a host of top private sector developers in Northern Ireland, alongside Belfast City Council and organisations such as Belfast Harbour. That includes Bywater, Wirefox, Titanic Quarter, Tribeca, McAleer  Rushe and Graham Group, along with the two universities and others working within related fields from law, professional services and the supply chain.For Joe and the delegation, MIPIM represents an opportunity to announce some of Belfast and Northern Ireland’s wider major new infrastructure and commercial plans. Previous visits have included the announcement of major offices schemes, hotels and apartment developments.“We will have a series of announcements – some of those announcements will be new, and some will be progress, and demonstrating to investors or occupiers that progress has been madeit’s a multi-year scheme, to show we are delivering.“… we have new projects coming through the pipeline in ious sectors. This year we are looking at launching schemes around digital innovation. That aligns with one of the themes in the Belfast Region City Deal, for the city and councils in the deal. We have a particular focus on cyber-security as an investment and operating location – particular those from the US.”Joe says that would be in addition to the already well-established cyber-security development at Catalyst in the Titanic Quarter, and that new names are coming in to the marketplace creating a “cluster” around the sector, and setting up Belfast and beyond as a new global hub.“We are looking at announcing some details around the Belfast-Dublin-London corridor,” Joe says.“As an economic corridor, or triangle. Post-Brexit, there are clear synergies in developing a proposition where companies can avail of the three locationsthey are looking at a global footprint, and see advantages to locations in three cities.”The issue of increasing connectivity between Belfast and Dublin also remains high on the list – improving the speed and frequency, and making developers aware of the new Belfast Transport Hub, which will transform the city’s rail and bus connectivity when complete.For Belfast Harbour, it’s also bringing the expansion of its already successful film studios to MIPIM, amid further plans to grow and develop the hub to attract big names and become the largest of its kind outside London.“We will be revealing more of our expansion plans, which is being supported by NI Screen,” Joe said. Some of those delivering their own presentations to potential investors will include the Harbour, Belfast City Council, Catalyst and the universities. “We are out looking around, when we are there, at what dferent cities are doing – seeing whether something works well, and looking at our competitive advantage in that area.”As for the strengths and attraction for potential investors, Joe says: “Skills, talent and technology are very much at the fore. Agility as a small region and to be able to respond, and seeing that team Belfast is there and that we are aligned with a particular project. It doesn’t have to be taken back home and introduced to someone .“There is the emergence of Belfast as an attractive city – investment opening up, and people are always looking at new markets. “Part of the initial roll-out when I took on the chair of MIPIM, the role was to go around to ask those who were on board previously to ask about it,it had changed. Everyone noticed and recognised considerablechange over the last four years. “We were pioneering and establishing ourselves four years ago, now they felt we were very much a concerted and effective operating team… the collective was a powerful message, and having  or lunches involving all of the stakeholders at one time. It’s a really strong  to take on the next chapter.”So, for Joe and the rest of the MIPIM delegation, what would be considered a major goal or success on the back of the visit to the commercial property show in March  “A particular focus this year is to attract key institutional investors – the big insurance companies for example. That’s a chicken and egg situation… you need to have product, to have product you have to show that you have occupiers and a steady revenue stream. “What we have been able to say to the investment market is ‘we have product and we now have sustainable occupation coming through… now it feels like the right time for you as an investor, to come in, and to support further investment’.”Asked whether replicating the successes of our neighbours in Dublin in attracting tech giants such as Apple, Facebook and Google is also on the cards, Joe says: “Something like that, or a major investor. For them to do that – a technology or an investment company – they need to see that the public, private and third-tier sectors are all collaborating together to make an effective market, and I think we are good at doing that now.”And the timing couldn’t be better for the delegation – now able to go in with a clear mandate and message with the restoration of the Executive and ato day-to-day power-sharing politics.“The positive thing for us is with the government and secondly, somearound Brexit… it takes those two challenging issues off the table.” πView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/johnm1.jpg","title":"companies must act quickly on new ir legislation reforms","story":"Posted on Monday February  by Ulster Business At the start of this year the government launched a review into the changes to IR legislation which will affect medium and large private sector organisations and have far-reaching impacts on the way they engage with non-permanent workers, writes John Moore, managing director, Hays NI.The timeframe between the review and the reforms coming into effect in April is shorter than many would have liked but with the reforms now on the horizon, companies need to act, particularly those in sectors such as technology, construction and finance where use of contractors operating as personal services companiesis common. At a basic level, the reforms to IR legislation sht the responsibility of determining the tax status of personal services company workers to the company that engages them where previously they could self-certy. The original rules required the freelance contractor to determine their tax status, but HMRC believed non-compliance was common.Now,a person’s assignment falls outside of IR legislation, they are deemed to be self-employed, so gross payment will be made to the PSC. Butthe assignment falls inside of IR, the professional should be treated as an employee, applying PAYE and NIC deductions from their payment. In simple terms, the tax arrangements for contractors are changing so that they won’t get such a good dealthey can’t demonstrate their work is out of scope and employers will have to pay more for using and keeping what were previously non-payroll workers.This will have a big effect on how people choose to work and who they choose to work for, not to mention how organisations plan and budget. An organisation’s policy towards contractors will affect how attractive they are to freelancers. But on the other side we’ve already seen some risk averse companies adopt a blanket ban on freelancers just to be safe – meaning they are missing out on skilled professionals they need to deliver projects.In Northern Ireland, as where, it’s likely the IR reforms will hit technology hardest, but the effects could be wide ranging across roles in construction, project management and finance.We’ve heard anecdotal evidence of IT contractors leaving the big banks and starting to view early stage tech companies with less than  employees more favourably because they fall outside the scope of the legislation. When similar legislation was introduced in the public sector in , hundreds of highly skilled contractors left roles to join organisations who were prepared, often leading to projects being scrapped. Now the private sector is catching up, preparation is key and anyone who hasn’t done a review of what it means for their capacity should do so urgently. A Hays survey showed % of private sector firms expect cost increases when IR reforms come into effect, % expect to lose key talent and % think it will be harder to bring in non-permanent workers. A third of organisations surveyed were completely unaware of the reforms – a big concern given how tight the labour market is.So, first you need to determine whether assignments are inside or outside of IR. You need to have full visibility of all workers your organisation engages who are paid via agencies and consultancies as well as knowledge of how they are paid. You will also need to have the expertise to determine the tax status of each assignment.

It’s a regulated utility business, and commercially, everything is regulated by the Utility Regulator.”Paul’s been in the energy industry for his entire working le. The Limerick man joined ESB in  where he held a number of senior management positions, before taking up his current role in May .He’s taken over NIE Networks as it’s hitting record performance targets, with those likely to improve further still this year.“The network is in as good as condition as it ever was, and we are giving a good service in terms of continuity of supply. “In , we achieved a ‘customer minutes lost’ average of  minutes, which is the lowest in our history. But we will continue to look at improving further. Where faults do occur, % are fixed within three hours and % within less than  hours. “We operate in business cycles around regulatory price controls. We are now just over two years into a six year price control. “There has been some downsizing, cost-reduction and efficiencies, while we are gearing up to deliver a signicant capital investment programme. We are investing more than £m a year in upgrading, refurbishing and maintaining the network.“The focus in present terms is about delivering for today and looking to enhance our services to customers.”But it’s the future of NIE Networks, power generation, and a new Strategic Energy Framework, which will become the focus for Paul and his team in the coming years.“A lot of my focus is about planning for the future, as well as the day-to-day,” he says. “The longer term horizon is now looking out to ,” he says. “The UK Government has enshrined in legislation the target that the economy will be entirely carbon neutral.”For Northern Ireland, it’s already broken recent records in terms of the move towards green energy. “There is a huge amount to be done and it’s a very challenging target,” he says.“It’s a huge change and transition. But I think all the scientic evidence regarding climate change suggests it has to be done, and maybe has to be done sooner.“The headline target was that we would hit % from renewable sources by . We actually achieved that target and are now at %. That is very signicant progress. It puts us ahead of GB and the Republic of Ireland.”NIE Networks has invested around £m in the network to facilitate this generation. In the last few years the number of power generators connecting to the network has grown to ,, whereas two decades ago it was reliant on the three main power stations here.“The bigger challenge is how do we use that green energy to displace carbon  That brings in transport and heat, and that’s something where the electricity sector will play an important role.“As we all start adopting electric vehicles, as I think we all will in the next decade, we have to make sure people have the ability to charge them, at home and in public spaces. It’s our role to connect the chargers and to make sure we have a network which has the capability to meet the demands.”But Paul says there’s signicant positivity out there, with a younger generation in Northern Ireland and throughout the world embracing the small everyday changes that have to be made in order to tackle an international problem.“We are in the policy framing stage and  is going to be key. There is a call for evidence now from the Department for the Economy to inform the development of a new Energy Strategy for Northern Ireland and I would encourage anyone who has any interest in energy or climate change to contribute into that.“Hopefully that will lead to the development of clear policy initiatives, targets and measures for Northern Ireland and that will set the context for the market to respond.“I think there is economic opportunity for Northern Ireland, but there will be some downsides. We need to minimise the downsides and maximise the opportunities.”NIE Networks is currently examining its role in the future energy market in Northern Ireland. That includes looking at how it can make the distribution network more open and accessible in order to allow burgeoning technologies, such as battery storage, heat pumps and electric vehicles, to be introduced and operate in a sustainable way.“We see our role as evolving. Historically, we were somewhat passive – we provided an infrastructure which shipped electricity from A to B. Now, we need to be much more proactive and we are part of an overall system.”That includes a role in balancing when green energy is available and when it is required and in high demand on the distribution system. “All of that needs a more connected and dynamic distribution system – rather than just being seen as a physical infrastructure,” Paul says.“We need private investment and developers who are willing to invest in new solutions, whether it’s wind, solar, electric vehicle charging or heat delivery. All of those need policy directions, but they also need a network to connect to, so we have a major role to enable all of that.”Paul says most businesses and iniduals now know that they “have to get on this journey” in order to play their part in tackling climate change, reducing their carbon emissions and improving energy efficiency.With Brexit, there have been concerns over the future of the all-island energy market. But Paul is confident that it will be secured, despite the UK’s exit from the EU. “That continuing is really important for businesses in Northern Ireland. Currently, all sides in the Brexit debate seem comfortable that the Single Electricity Marketwill continue, so we don’t see any specic threat around that.”As part of NIE Networks’ Northern Ireland-wide investment in infrastructure – of around £m a year – it has recently completed a £, investment in the Cathedral Quarter area of Belfast – where our interview took place – which is home to many of its best known pubs and restaurants. “That gives us a more resilient and reliable supply, as well as capacity for the future,” Paul says. Some of the other latest investments include projects in Enniskillen in advance of a new public realm scheme, along with another in Newry.“Right across Northern Ireland we are continuing to invest,” Paul says. “There is a lot going on. There’s a lot to do today, challenges, to keep efficient supply for the economy, but equally we need to plan for the future.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
