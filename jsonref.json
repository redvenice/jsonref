MailOnline understands the captain put a breathing mask on himself and the first officer as they came into land on January 2. Within two minutes the A320 aircraft was on the ground and then grounded for 48 hours while BA investigated          Almost 300 \u0027fume events\u0027 were reported on BA flights last year and almost 100 cases of alleged \u0027aerotoxicity\u0027 are currently being brought against the airline. Aviation experts said the most probable cause of a fume event is a broken seal or maintenance issue oil leakBA said it was standard practice for pilots to put on oxygen masks if they fear their breathing has been compromised by potentially dangerous odours that affect their ability to fly the plane.A BA spokesman said: \u0027The Captain landed the aircraft safely, and customers disembarked as normal. \u0027As the First Officer was feeling unwell, he was seen by an airport paramedic as a precaution, before going home.\u0027An AAIB spokesman said: \u0027An incident was reported to the AAIB and we are investigating. When our investigation has concluded we will publish a report.\u0027 The airline is being sued by almost 100 staff who claim their health has been affected by the fumes from the engines that are said to smell like old socks. Aviation experts say the most probable cause of a fume event is a broken seal or maintenance issue oil leak.Oil for aircraft engines contains an additive called tricresyl phosphate, or TCP, that helps reduce wear on the engines. It is a toxin that can smell like old socks and causes nausea a vomiting to anyone who inhales it.         BA is currently fighting a class action against former staff who claim their health has been affected by continued exposure to toxic fumes or aerotoxicity. The case is being spearheaded by the family of BA pilot Richard Westgate, 43, who took his own life in 2012         His family say his ill health caused by toxic fumes led him to self medicate and contribute to his death. BA have denied any liability in Mr Westgate\u0027s death and the High Court case is ongoing         In April 2017, a coroner overseeing an inquest into Mr Westgate\u0027s (left) death ruled his overdose was accidental, but heard evidence that a post-mortem revealed damage to his heart and nervous system, which his family say were signs of his exposure to aerotoxicityIn its legal action Unite - which represents cabin crew - claims pilots and crew are exposed to frequent \u0027fume events\u0027 that can lead to chronic ill-health and life-threatening conditions.Howard Beckett, from Unite, said: \u0027The airline industry cannot continue to hide from the issue of toxic cabin air whilst placing the health and safety of aircrew at risk.\u0027The case is being spearheaded by the family of BA pilot Richard Westgate, 43, who took his own life in 2012 from an overdose of sleeping pills.His family say his ill health caused by toxic fumes led him to self medicate and contribute to his death.In April 2017, a coroner overseeing an inquest into his death ruled his overdose was accidental, but heard evidence that a post-mortem revealed damage to his heart and nervous system, which his family say were signs of his exposure to aerotoxicity.BA have denied any liability in Mr Westgate\u0027s death and the High Court case is ongoing.The BA spokesman said: \u0027We would never operate an aircraft if we believed it posed any health or safety risk to our customers or crew.          In its legal action Unite - which represents cabin crew - claims pilots and crew are exposed to frequent \u0027fume events\u0027 that can lead to chronic ill-health and life-threatening conditions         BA said: \u0027We would never operate an aircraft if we believed it posed any health or safety risk to our customers or crew. Research by the European Aviation Safety Agency concluded that the air quality on board aircraft was similar or better than that observed in normal indoor environments\u0027\u0027Research commissioned by the European Aviation Safety Agency in 2017 concluded that the air quality on board aircraft was similar or better than that observed in normal indoor environments.\u0027Safety is our first priority and every report is thoroughly investigated, with typically 151 engineering checks before an aircraft is cleared to continue flying.\u0027Fume or odour events have been found to be caused by a wide range of issues, including burnt food in the oven, aerosols and e-cigarettes, strongly-smelling food in cabin bags, and de-icing fluid.\u0027  "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/01/14/22/23403230-7887773-image-a-57_1579040930675.jpg","title":"Meghan Markle visits womens shelter Vancouver","story":"Pick a parka coat by Barbour like MeghanNow sold out - shop similar at John Lewis \u0026amp PartnersIt\u0026#39s chilly over there in Vancouver but Meghan Markle found a way to stay toasty in style thanks to her Barbour parka coat.The classic brand is also favoured by  the likes of the Duchess of Cambridge, and is the ultimate go-to when it comes to nailing an outdoor-chic vibe.A parka coat is a stalwart outerwear choice, offering practical appeal with a nod to nineties cool too.

She has been hugging Penny and is so overjoyed. \u0027You wouldn\u0027t believe how happy my daughter is – I am as well. \u0027We were so heartbroken she was taken but now so she has come home.\u0027 In the extraordinary row between the neighbours, Cookson was filmed climbing over Mr James\u0027 five-foot high fence and jumping into his back garden.         Mr Daniel said Penny\u0027s return was a \u0027happy ending\u0027 for the family and said his eight-year-old daughter is over the moon to have her beloved cocker iel home again       Mr Daniel had no idea what his neighbour had done with Penny (pictured) for four months until last week when police phoned him to say that she had been found in the south of ManchesterShe then grabbed the portable kennel Penny was kept in and jumped back into her parents\u0027 garden. Another cocker iel he owns called Molly watched the theft but was not targeted and was found running around the garden. Mr Daniel discovered the theft when he arrived home from a trip to the supermarket. Despite being caught red-handed, the teenager refused to tell police where the elusive cocker iel was being held.She ignored desperate appeals to return the dog from Mr James, leaving his daughter \u0027extremely upset\u0027. The college student was quizzed by police and said she had given Penny away to a friend as she believed the dog wasn\u0027t being looked after properly. Cookson admitted theft before magistrates and was ordered to pay £600 compensation after refusing to disclose Penny\u0027s whereabouts. She was also ordered to complete a 12 month community order and 150 hours unpaid work and was told to pay costs of £85.               The dog-napping led to a bitter fall out between father-of-two Mr Daniel and teenager Cookson as she ignored his pleas to hand back the dog, leaving his daughter incredibly upset, he says          Cookson, 19, was fined £600 at Manchester Magistrates\u0027 Court in November for taking Penny. The court was shown footage of her scaling Mr Daniel\u0027s fence and stealing the beloved puppy Penny had initially not been found despite Mr Daniel making repeated appeals to Cookson\u0027s mother and father who live next door to him. Defending Stephen Connor told the court: \u0027In interview she accepted she had taken this dog and indeed she attended the interview on a voluntary basis. \u0027Throughout the course of her interview she raised real concerns about the health of the dog that she took and the health of other puppies that she says were in the back garden. \u0027She has been open with me because she was that alarmed about the health of those dogs - the CCTV actually shows her on her phone trying to get through to the RSPCA but was being kept waiting. \u0027In hindsight she accepts she took a foolish decision and she regrets that. \u0027The dog was given to a friend the defendant is adamant that she hasn\u0027t received any financial gain - you are dealing with a 19-year-old lady who had never even troubled the courts.\u0027 Her mother Elaine told Mailonline after her conviction: \u0027She\u0027s sorry for what happened – she made a mistake. She told me she\u0027s given the dog to someone else to look after.\u0027          The family\u0027s other cocker iel Molly (pictured) was left behind by Cookson despite being in the garden with Penny at the time she was spirited awayMr Daniel said his ordeal came to a \u0027happy ending\u0027 on Friday with a call from police to say the missing dog had been located. \u0027We don\u0027t really know the circumstances of how she was found,\u0027 he said. \u0027The police just rang up and said she\u0027s been found in south Manchester.

But the last one closed its doors for the final time on Wednesday when Debenhams pulled down the shutters.The store is one of 19 being closed across the country by the beleaguered chain this month, and it’s a big blow to Stockton, where New Look is also due to shut down on Saturday and many shoppers still mourn the loss of the Marks \u0026amp Spencer in 2018.Geoff Russell, 65, has lived in Stockton all his life and has seen several businesses shut up shop over the years, but Debenhams’ closure is particularly painful. “It’s a shame. It’s an institution, it’s part of Stockton. There will be no turning back from this now.“I definitely won’t be going to Middlesbrough instead – this is my local. I’ve been going in there a lot of years and I know a lot of staff. We have a good craic with them. It’s a lot of job losses, and what’s out there for people?”His wife, Janet Russell, said she had been shopping here for 60 years: “We’ve probably got half of Debenhams in our bedroom.”She remembers when the site was home to Robinsons, the first of a small chain of department stores across the north opened by Matthias Robinson. Opening in 1896, the family went on to run similar stores in Hartlepool, Leeds and Darlington, before the chain was sold to Debenhams in 1962.On Wednesday, the sprawling shop is mostly empty. Large areas are cordoned off with red and white tape, and clothes racks stand in a sea of empty shop floor. But there are queues at the tills, and people are rummaging through the last of the stock for bargains. Puma trainers that had retailed at £98.50 are going for £15 a £45 duvet has been reduced to £18.Samantha Pye and her mother, Sue Maston, have been coming to the store for the past couple of weeks to pick up bargains. Pye leaves with a coat stand, which was previously part of the shop fittings, for the sum of £10.Large sheets of paper have been left out for people to write messages. One reads, “End of an era for us, sorry to see it go”, while another says, “Would make a fab Primark to keep Stockton alive.” One simply reads: “Bloody online.”Sue and Peter Mathieson live in Hartlepool and have been coming to Stockton to shop at Debenhams for around 15 years. “I just think it’s a shame. We basically won’t come to Stockton any more,” says Sue. “We know all the staff. We just wanted to say bye to the girls who we’ve known over the years. I feel so sorry for them all.”The Debenhams closures this month, expected to result in 660 job losses, are part of a three-year strategy that will see 50 stores shut in total. The company entered administration last year, after struggling to compete with online shopping trends and keep up with rent on its large stores. Similarly, New Look expects to lose 85 stores as part of restructuring plans announced in 2018.Rachel Anderson, assistant director of policy at the North East Chamber of Commerce, says: “While it is disappointing that we’re losing some big national retailers who have had a very traditional anchor in Stockton, I think what we have to see it as is an opportunity to really reshape the town centre. I don’t think it’s a death knell for the town.”She points toward the Globe, an art-deco entertainment venue a few doors down from Debenhams, which is undergoing a £4.5m restoration and is due to open in November, as evidence that the town centre is far from dying.She also praised the proactive approach of the council, which in the past year has bought the town’s two main shopping centres, Wellington Square and Castlegate, to take control of the centre and re-create the town in a way that works best for its residents.Nigel Cooke, cabinet member for regeneration and housing for Stockton Borough Council, said: “Lots of people in Stockton, including my own family, shopped in Debenhams most weeks, so it’s a sad day and I’m thinking of the people who lost their jobs.“But this model of large, chain-store retail is on its knees. In Stockton we’ve got far too much retail space, so we need to go back to what the high street was 50-60 years ago, where it wasn’t just a place to shop, but a place where people live and work and come for experiences.”"},{"url":null,"title":"uk electric van maker arrival secures 85m from kia and hyundai","story":"Investment from Korean giants means startup is valued at £3bn, giving it ‘unicorn’ statusThe UK-based electric van maker Arrival has secured an £85m investment from South Korean car firms Hyundai and Kia – a cash injection which values the business at £3bn, defying the struggles of the British automotive industry.The money will be used by Arrival to fund the next stage of its development as it prepares to scale up production of an electric van it hopes will rival those from more established manufacturers. The Korean companies will work with Arrival to develop new commercial vehicles with zero exhaust emissions.The £3bn valuation means Arrival has achieved “unicorn” status, a new company valued at more than $1bn (£770m). This is a rare feat with British manufacturing.The company was founded in 2015 by Denis Sverdlov, a Russian entrepreneur who sold Yota, a telecoms firm and smartphone manufacturer, in 2013. Arrival has since grown rapidly, expanding its UK and global workforce from 600 people in September to 800.It has a factory in Banbury, but it has plans to build “microfactories” near major markets such as Los Angeles and New York. The company says those plants would be profitable producing only a few thousands vans a year.Arrival’s first product is a battery-powered electric van, priced at the same level as comparable petrol or diesel vehicles. The van is targeted at urban delivery, which does not have long range requirements that would be limited by today’s battery technology. Prototype vans have already been trialled by delivery companies including Royal Mail, DHL and DPD, as well as BT.Arrival’s rapid expansion is being watched with interest by other carmakers. Rather than emulate traditional assembly line processes, the company says its modular design means robots can assemble the vans in a single location. While designing and building a new vehicle platform is thought to cost traditional carmakers about £1bn, Arrival says it could do so for £100m.Arrival has developed most of the vehicle itself, including software, components, materials and a modular “skateboard” platform. The company also has a longer-term ambition to enter the more competitive market for passenger cars.The investment will also give Kia and Hyundai access to Arrival’s manufacturing technology, underlining the pressure more established automotive players are experiencing as the industry begins to move away from fossil fuels.Youngcho Chi, Hyundai’s head of innovation, said: “This investment is part of an open innovation strategy pursued by Hyundai and Kia. We will accelerate investment and cooperation with companies with advanced technology such as Arrival, to respond to the rapidly changing eco-friendly vehicle market.”Sverdlov described Arrival’s offering as “generation two electric vehicles” and said the £85m investment would allow global expansion.The cash injection is a welcome piece of news at a time when the British automotive industry is earmarking factories for closure and investment has for the most part stalled. Ford’s Bridgend engine plant will shut by September, while Honda’s Swindon factory will close in 2021."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f6a55c6bae9e5275e6c2daa296cda4bf6dcf0a63/207_0_5553_3333/master/5553.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6ead1f210a1f7cf5abeb3c60cdff4c5f","title":"the case for truly taking back control by reversing the privatisation of our cities","story":"From sparkling water fountains to better waste services and lower drug prices, cities are showing the benefits of remunicipalisation Cities is concluding with ‘The case for ...”, a series of opinion pieces exploring options for radical urban change. Read our editor’s farewell hereIn 2015, a strident editorial appeared in Global Water Intelligence, a trade magazine for the water industry, under the title: Exorcising the “R” word. “It would be a travesty,” the writer declared, to let “the ill-informed propaganda of a few NGOs” interfere with private sector involvement in the water business.The unspeakable “R” word that had provoked such a defensive stance? Remunicipalisation: the taking back of privatised assets and services into public ownership at a local level.This dangerous idea, the Global Water Intelligence piece said, would be “unlikely to be taken seriously by intelligent decision-makers in the industry”, because of all the “valid and rational arguments behind private sector participation” in providing water.The agency, Eau de Paris, even installed free fountains providing sparkling water – a comically French idea, perhaps, but cheap, and good for the environment, preventing thousands of plastic bottles from heading to landfill sites. It also illustrated an important point: when our urban infrastructure is owned by the public rather than profit-making corporations,  everyone – not just shareholders – can have nice things.The word remunicipalisation does not lend itself to catchy slogans. It is, perhaps, somewhat alienatingly wonkish: in-sourcing civic infrastructure is not generally thought of as sexy politics. But its popularity is on the rise worldwide. The Transnational Institute (TNI), a thinktank in Amsterdam, has been banging the drum for years. Its latest report, The Future Is Public, identifies more than 1,400 cases of remunicipalisation since the turn of the millennium, in more than 2,400 cities across 58 countries.The benefits of remunicipalisation fall into two broad categories: first, correcting what has gone wrong in our cities after decades of privatisation, profit-extraction and waste and second, forging a new sense of the public good.“The privatisation and outsourcing of the last 30-40 years has failed,” says Cat Hobbs of the Oxford-based campaigning organisation We Own It. . “It tends to cost us more, it means that we get worse services, we have less control over them, and there is less democratic accountability to us, the public.“But it’s also a moral question. We’re often talking about natural monopolies like water, where competition doesn’t make sense, and the market doesn’t really belong. When we talk about ‘people not profit’, everyone understands that.”The alternative, she argues, is one in which public ownership at the local level can ensure there are better, more stable jobs for communities, prioritising sustainability rather than idends for shareholders. From social care to libraries to refuse collection, privatisation has cut these services to the bone.Remunicipalisation could resonate particularly well in the UK, because it speaks to some of the same political shifts that led to Brexit. “We know that part of Brexit is about people wanting decisions to be taken near to where they live,” Hobbs says. “It’s about a sense of accountability and economic sovereignty, and taking back control.”Why not help people actually take back control, in a way that transcends not just the 2016 referendum vote, but also how people voted in the recent UK election? Perhaps some of the questions being asked about Labour’s “lost heartlands” – about how you rebuild a civic sphere, and a sense of local community and participation in post-industrial cities – could be answered through remunicipalisation.“Simply parcelling off public services to whichever multinational company can do it the cheapest is not a way of showing we value our communities,” says Hobbs. “This is core to a decent society.”But if remunicipalisation is a local movement, it is a global phenomenon, with the sharing of radical ideas and best practice among progressive city halls across the world. This sharing is the policy arm of the Fearless Cities organisation, and the book of the same name, which unites the growing municipalist movement.Fearless Cities is best seen as a revanchist programme, trying to claw back some of the territory taken over the by the privatisation orthodoxy that began spreading globally during the Reagan and Thatcher era. Institutions such as the IMF, WTO and the World Bank pushed outsourcing of government services, and tough conditions on loans that had the effect of encouraging privatisation and fire-sales of public assets.The 2008 global financial crisis, however, shook the assumption that the private sector would produce the best results in cities. It is telling that the first political response to the crash began in 2011 with the Occupy movement – in the public spaces of world cities such as Athens, Madrid, London and New York. These “movements of the squares” soon found political expression at a national level, via new parties like Podemos and Syriza, and in Bernie Sanders’ and Jeremy Corbyn’s political successes.“It is the best way to concretise demands to defend public services,” says TNI’s remunicipalisation guru Sol Trumbo, reflecting on the power of this kind of local action. There are a number of strategic advantages to focusing on city-level change, he says, especially for the left.“If you are confronting neoliberal thinking and dogmas, it’s much harder to find a clear position on something as complex as, say the EU, or Nato membership. But if your political debate is around questions like: ‘Are there enough parks? Is public transport working or not? Are there too many cars on the streets?’ The questions are really tangible, and close to people’s lives, and it’s easier for progressive politics to provide an answer.”They ought to become still closer. Part of the remunicipalisation ideal is that it is not simply an obscure asset transfer from private to public ownership – a change in the paperwork that will pass ordinary citizens by. Rather, it aims to increase participation in decision-making, boost local democracy and civic energy, and make services fairer and more accessible.“In these moments of political uncertainty and distrust, locality and proximity is really useful,” Trumbo says. What better way to rebuild local community, local connections, local pride? I’ll raise my free sparkling water to that."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9f738068bf507c9821c3c5f2ddd547f734ece5ac/0_205_4096_2458/master/4096.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d027cde4d6449fa874c5d1f43699f1ae","title":"adrian chiles must we settle for fanny","story":"I am friends with a Croatian couple who translate erotic fiction. This is eye-opening – not least my realisation that the UK doesn’t have nearly enough female-friendly euphemismsSome time at the end of the last century, I made a mistake. Friends of mine, a Croatian couple, asked me to find them a book called the The Art of Selling, and take it to them in Zagreb when I was next there. This was pre-internet and Amazon and all that caper, so it took some finding. Upon slapping it triumphantly on my friends’ kitchen table, I was told this wasn’t the book they were after far from it. They had asked me for The Art of Sailing. Imagine their disappointment.However, in a lifetime of unforced errors, this one was more or less alone in that it actually turned out for the best. My friends read The Art of Selling, liked it, saw a market for it, translated it into Croatian, sold lots of copies, and their publishing business was born. I saw them last week these days they are engaged in the translation of erotic fiction into Croatian. This, as you can imagine, has its challenges. The word “manhood” is one. “What’s that all about?” my friend Zrinka asked me.“No idea,” I shrugged. There is a Croatian word for manhood but in this context it sounds absurd. Also, she tells me there is no translation for having sex that is neither lewd nor technical-sounding, like the word “copulation”, which she is often forced to use. It’s nicely neutral, she says. I took this as a compliment to our language, but it probably says something less complimentary about our attitude to sex.The words for orgasm are similar to ours, although they do have a charming archaic one in occasional use: sladostrašće, which is literally “sweet passion”. Nice. “It’s kind of like la petite mort,” said Zrinka. “You use that in English, don’t you?”Do we? I’ve heard of tell of it, but can’t say I’ve ever uttered it.“Any trouble with other words for cock?” I asked, eager to be of assistance.“No, we’re good for those. We have plenty.”But this led us on to nice words for our reproductive organs. Willy, she reminded me, is pipek (pronounced pip-ek). Sweet. But ever since I begat daughters I have bemoaned the lack of a sweet word for girls’ bits. Willy is a lovely word: sweet, affectionate, harmless and a bit funny. It’s so bad, and telling, that we don’t have such a thing for girls? What’s our nice little word for vagina? There isn’t one really, is there? The one I hated most when my girls were little was “front bottom”, which is plainly awful. Who thought that one up? “Fanny” was eventually plumped for, in my girls’ case. It kind of did the job, although their grandparents winced. Asked for a better suggestion, they just shrugged helplessly and changed the subject.My mum said to me that when she was a little girl in the 1940s in Zagreb, she called it her šljiva, which means “plum”. Hmm, more confusion if you ask me. Now they have a better word in Croatian. It is related to the boys’ pipek: “pipica” (pronounced pip-i-tsa). Trust me, it’s an enchanting, affectionate diminutive.We ought to have something similar. Honestly, I think it is rather sad and even unhealthy that we don’t have something similar. Or can we all just settle on fanny and be done with it?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f8771c6b838a46c2953cc907228fbd0f40dfc245/947_924_5410_3246/master/5410.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1e42da7c4680c2be1bcc77139d427d9c","title":"playing the race card racism black experience","story":"In Britain we seem to be living in a kind of educational apartheid, in which most of us remain profoundly ignorant about racism and its history. This leaves a minority who have either a lived experience of it or have made an effort to self-educate with the gargantuan task of communicating how racism works, and the language in which it manifests.But campus racism is a small part of the whole picture, and is mostly ignored by society. When experiences migrate to the royal family, however, and the ensuing debate plays out in our media, the world is watching. The Harry and Meghan saga has brought a global audience to the newly popular British sport of demanding that people of colour share their knowledge of racism on live TV while media heavyweights attempt to silence, shame or undermine them.Take, for example, “playing the race card” – one of their favoured phrases. I didn’t know I had any such cards until I began to educate myself about racism in Britain. But it seems that when I thought I was offering either a structural or personal analysis of how racism has affected black people’s lives, what I was actually doing was merely playing cards. Yet these magical cards don’t actually work. When we use them, the argument then turns from a sensible discussion into a shouting match. If this is supposed to be winning, it doesn’t feel much like victory.The real point about race cards is that claiming their existence is itself deeply racist. The idea first seems to have entered the lexicon in the 1960s, when “the race card” was used to describe the ways in which rightwing politicians weaponised fears about black people to gain votes – such as the 1964 Conservative parliamentary candidate for Smethwick reportedly warning his prospective constituents: “If you want a nigger for a neighbour, vote Labour.” These days, it is more frequently deployed to delegitimise the voices of people on the receiving end of those narratives. Either way, the one consistent thing seems to be that it always involves setting up people of colour to lose.As the author Nels Abbey pointed out this week, accusing a black person of “playing the race card” when they speak about racism is intended to silence, threaten or “shame someone into not mentioning the obvious racism they’re being subjected to”. A significant number of British people would like to silence us. But the real tragedy here lies with a far greater number who seek to challenge racism but are unsure how to achieve it. Last week, for example, a teacher contacted me about how she could decolonise the key stage 2 curriculum for her class of eight-year-olds. She was anxious to avoid narratives that exoticise people of African heritage, or feed into imperial ideas about “primitives”.While I’m familiar with the problem, it was far harder than I expected to help in any practical way, since the vast majority of resources exist for university students. Those struggling to do the right thing for younger learners rely on the unpaid work of black teachers who have developed their own tools for the classroom.The lack of value attached to antiracism work is an old problem, but its costs are becoming ever clearer. This week a senior Commonwealth figure told me that the tabloid treatment of Meghan – so clearly racist to observers in other parts of the world, while large parts of the British public remain in denial – is having a knock-on effect in making it harder for him to promote Britain abroad.No doubt future generations will teach the racism of our media in this moment just as we now talk about Smethwick. Our comprehension is so slow to catch up that we seem only to understand racism in hindsight. Those of us who see it in real time continue to do the work, no matter what the tabloids call us."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/023540b163b6d87960ba72297e1569324310d0b0/0_225_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e91bde2457463d7a86256af9ace0caff","title":"record numbers of state school pupils given oxford places","story":"But since 2015, the university has overhauled its application system and pressed inidual colleges to improve their recruitment and outreach.

The world’s scientists have warned that global heating beyond 1.5C will significantly worsen extreme weather and suffering for hundreds of millions of people.The World Economic Forum’s global risk assessment for the next decade, also published on Wednesday, found the top five dangers were all environmental, including extreme weather, failure to prepare for climate change and the destruction of the natural world.“The last decade was easily the warmest decade in the record and is the first decade more than 1C above late 19th-century temperatures,” said Gavin Schmidt, of Nasa’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies, which produced one of the temperature records.“What is important is the totality of evidence from multiple independent data sets that the Earth is warming, that human activity is driving it and the impacts are clearly being felt,” he said. “These announcements might sound like a broken record, but what is being heard is the drumbeat of the Anthropocene.”“It’s now official that we have just completed the warmest decade on record, a reminder that the planet continues to warm as we continue to burn fossil fuels,” said Prof Michael Mann at Penn State University in the US.While instrumental temperature records stretch back to 1850, data from ice cores indicate that today’s temperatures were last seen at least 100,000 years ago. Furthermore, the level of carbon dioxide is the highest it has been for several million years, when the sea level was 15-20 metres higher.The four temperature datasets are compiled from many millions of surface temperature measurements taken across the globe, from all continents and all oceans. They are produced by the UK Met Office with the University of East Anglia (UEA), both Nasa and Noaa in the US, and Europe’s Copernicus Climate Change Service. Small differences between the analyses arise from how data-sparse polar regions are treated, but all agree that the past five years are the warmest five years since each global record began.The Met Office’s forecast for global average temperature for 2020 suggests this year could well set another record and is very likely to be among the top three hottest. The UK government will host a critical UN climate summit in Glasgow in November. The UN secretary general, António Guterres, and many others are urging nations to increase dramatically their pledges to cut carbon emissions, which would  lead to global temperatures rising by a disastrous 3-4C.“It is obvious we are not succeeding in preventing dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system, which was the main goal of the original 1992 UN climate change convention,” said Bob Ward, of the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change at the London School of Economics.“Even if we succeed in limiting warming to 1.5C, this would not be a ‘safe’ level of warming for the world,” he said. “Therefore we must focus on cutting global emissions to net zero as soon as possible. We know the transition to a net zero economy is the growth story of the 21st century.”Rosie Rogers, of Greenpeace UK, said: “We’re breaking more records than Usain Bolt, but there are no gold medals for dangerous temperature rises, or the floods and fires that come with it. We cannot run away from the climate emergency.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/784681cbc9abaa291f70cb6d641034c353a3e2c6/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=88b1d9044c2370292ee3f0a77c69b1b5","title":"what the five hottest years on earth look like in pictures","story":"The past five years – and the past decade – are the hottest in 150 years, the latest research has shown.

Weathering With You, full of overcharged teenage emotion, was Japan’s highest-grossing film of 2019. Like Your Name, it’s thrillingly beautiful: Tokyo is animated in hyperreal intricacy, every dazzling detail dialled up to 11, but it’s less of a heartbreaker.During the wettest rainy season on record in Tokyo, 16-year-old runaway Hodaka, homeless and hungry, arrives from the sticks. In a fast-food restaurant, teenage waitress Hina gives him a free burger, and two patches of red flush across his cheeks adorably. (The animation of first love, its highs and humiliations, is gorgeous.)Hina, it turns out, is a “sun girl”. Like weather maidens from mythology, she can bring a halt to the rain with a prayer. The pair start a business: weddings, school sports days, flea markets – if you need a dry spell, call.Japanese, apparently, has at least 50 words for rain. The film gives us the cinematic equivalent. It’s everywhere: raindrops bouncing off umbrellas, ploshing into puddles on grey streets, or shining like diamonds on electricity cables. Each instance is a miracle of loveliness. And, as the rainy season drags on, it dawns on Hodaka and Hina that the fate of the world depends on her powers, but at a personal cost.I’m not sure how far environmental catastrophes in Shinkai’s films reveal an anxiety about the planet. They may be there simply to ramp up the emotional intensity. Is that the end of the world coming? Or a teenager’s heart breaking? Same thing. Still, I remember watching Your Name with a heart-squeezing feeling. This movie didn’t leave the same impression maybe second time around it doesn’t have quite the same impact.• Weathering With You is released in the UK and in the US on 17 January."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/84ac92a83ff94398ba278c9fcc9343f4c3457247/0_21_3008_1805/master/3008.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a49bdc2e7b8a34b004c91e62985c4a76","title":"learned worst kitchen accidents broken glass boiling water","story":"‘Unlike regular knives,” runs the press release for Viners’ new cutlery, “the pointed end has been removed, helping to tackle knife-related injuries.” And there’s a picture. They look quite silly without a pointy end, but they also call into question why this has never been done before – indeed, why kitchen knives evolved to be the shape they are. Because you never use the point, or maybe you do once every couple of years for a particularly slidey tomato. All regular chopping is done with the blade edge.I shall not be buying a pointless knife but I thought I would take the opportunity to run through the top kitchen injuries of myself and everyone I know, so that younger readers can avoid them. Note: almost all of these start with being drunk. If you’re never drunk, you could probably keep a leopard in your kitchen and get away with it.Making something as innocuous as coffee, I once spilled a kettle of boiling water on to my hand, and woke up the next day with a giant blister that ran from my wrist to the tip of each finger. I had to get it re-dressed every day by the nurse at work. It was someone different each day, and they all said: “Have you always had a mole on that finger? Because, if not, a brown or black mark beneath a blister indicates gangrene.” And I’d say, “Hang on, let me check my mole inventory … no, wait I DON’T HAVE ONE OF THOSE, BECAUSE NOBODY DOES.” And they would always look at me, like “I don’t know why you’re shouting at me, love, you’re the one who spilled boiling water on herself.” And then they would say: “You’re lucky it wasn’t oil, or you’d have definitely lost this hand.” And the moral of this story is there is nothing more dangerous in the kitchen than boiling water, except boiling oil. After that, I didn’t deep-fry for about a decade.All other burning incidents pale into insignificance besides this one indeed, your classic chef’s burn – a straight line across the forearm from the oven shelf – is a badge of honour and I feel quite chuffed when I get one of those.In the sharp sphere, the thing that’s a thousand times more dangerous than knives is glass. I once gashed myself with a broken tumbler (I’m trying to avoid saying where, because it makes me sound chaotic OK, it was my hip), and left it overnight before I went to hospital, by which time it had begun to heal, but very inelegantly, like …well, not “like” – this was exactly what it was – a gaping wound. So they had to – doctor’s own words – “rough it up” before they could stitch it, which was exactly as it sounds, very painful and also a bit surreal. A friend severed a tendon on a broken jar of pickled onions, and couldn’t work for six months. It is so incredibly perilous that my honest advice is: whatever state of clumsiness you were in when you broke the glass, you are too clumsy to clear it up, and you should go immediately to bed and do it eight hours later.There is a lot of hidden danger to be had from a mandoline, especially when you’ve just bought it. I shaved the tops off four fingers in one go, straight into a dish of potatoes, which I then had to throw away. The waste bugged me as much as the copious loss of blood, although that could have been a displacement emotion. A friend got hospitalised filleting a sea bass, whose spines are incredibly sharp. Oh, and my dad licked a knife to get chocolate mousse off it, blade edge first, and then was so surprised by the entirely predictable event of cutting his mouth open that he kind of knocked into a kitchen cabinet and broke a rib. But he was incredibly clumsy: he made me look like I’d been to finishing school.Never forget the danger of food itself, which can get all kinds of hot, and also be poisonous. I find it karmically satisfying that chickens, which alive pose the threat level of a dirty look, can nearly kill you once they’re dead, by something as simple as a cooked one being placed on a chopping board recently inhabited by a raw one. Just by being no respecter of sell-by dates or basic hygiene, I’ve got ill via sausages, bacon, oysters, rice, mince and, one time, an unknown thing I put in my mouth because I found it in my pocket.I just asked my Mr for his worst kitchen accident, and he said: “My mother’s cooking”, but he was definitely making a hilarious joke because his -reading mother is an excellent cook."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/40262b6225405d17233975c79309c2ff637d2f2f/85_0_3790_2274/master/3790.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=024f65cbcba2bb984e4c68f162c42289","title":"marcus rashford manchester united injury liverpool doubt","story":"• Forward injures back in FA Cup replay win over Wolves • Ole Gunnar Solskjær admits substitution ‘backfired’Marcus Rashford is a doubt for Manchester United’s visit to Liverpool on Sunday after Ole Gunnar Solskjær admitted the striker’s introduction as a substitute in the FA Cup replay win over Wolves “backfired”.The manager brought United’s top scorer on midway through the second half at Old Trafford but he had to be taken off after only 15 minutes. Matt Doherty appeared to knock Rashford, who will have tests to determine his availability for the match against the league leaders at Anfield.“He has struggled a little bit with his back before and got another knock and I think he got a knock to his knee too.

The club’s £30m record signing from Rennes last summer was beset by injury problems after his arrival in England and had just spurned a golden opportunity to record his second Premier League goal against Liverpool, embarrassingly missing the ball when it fell to him unmarked in front of the Kop with the score level.A month on, however, Mané’s advice to Deeney seems to have paid off. Sarr has been an integral reason behind Watford’s rapid rise up the table, having scored crucial goals in the wins over Manchester United and Aston Villa before setting up Abdoulaye Doucouré for the opening goal in the crucial victory against Bournemouth on Sunday. But the 21-year-old’s performances have come as no surprise to Mady Touré, who first met Sarr at his Génération Foot academy in Dakar when the player was 14.“He’s doing well at the moment because I think he is starting to adapt to English football,” Touré says. “At the start when he was transferred for €35m there was a sort of handbrake on but I think he has taken that off now. That’s no surprise, he has always been like that, ever since we first took him. Ismaïla is a gazelle, so he needs time. Now he has got his bearings and he is starting to play well. It’s not surprising because he is a very good player.Génération Foot, established in 2000 by Touré with the support of the singer Youssou N’Dour, a childhood friend, is also Mané’s alma mater and has produced more than 10 full internationals as well winning Senegal’s league twice in the past three years with a side made up largely of teenagers. Sarr, who was born in Saint-Louis on Senegal’s north-west coast, moved to the academy after being spotted by one of Touré’s army of scouts in the west African country before, like Mané and the former Newcastle striker Papiss Cissé, joining the French club Metz.Touré’s prediction to the  in 2014 that Mané could one day emulate Lionel Messi or Neymar has almost come true after an outstanding year for the Liverpool forward in which he was crowned as Africa’s best player for the first time but he has a different forecast for Sarr.“Ismaïla and Sadio don’t have the same style,” Touré says. “What I can say is that Ismaïla is a little like Cristiano Ronaldo. And Ronaldo is his idol. They have quite a similar way of playing. I said Sadio would blow up in England and I can tell you that Ismaïla will do the same. He will even win a Ballon d’Or too. He is fast, powerful and now that he has his bearings … and it’s only his first season, you will see how he gets better and progresses. I think he is well set to become one of the best players in England and the world.”As for Mané’s advice for Deeney, Touré admits he watched the video of their encounter at Anfield filled with pride. “It was great,” he says. “Sadio is his big brother. He is one of the icons of world football, so it’s natural he recommends his younger brother.”Footage of N’Dour performing his tribute song to Mané at the Grand Bal à Mbour music festival at the start of December has gone viral, with the singer most famous in the UK for his single 7 Seconds with Neneh Cherry paying tribute to the Liverpool forward after he finished fourth behind Messi in last year’s Ballon d’Or. “Sadio, of course you did not win this time but you win a place in GOLD in the heart of any African,” N’Dour wrote on Twitter.But while Touré is justifiably honoured by the success of a player he frequently refers to as “my son”, he insists this is just the start for Mané and believes it may be time for the 27-year-old to leave Anfield at the end of the season.“The fact Sadio has won the African Ballon d’Or will spur him on to win the European one too,” he says. “That’s his objective. Sadio always told me he would become one of the best players in the world. He said that to me and now he is among them but he has to leave Liverpool now. It’s his last year and he has to leave Liverpool when it’s up to go to Barcelona or Real Madrid.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/995418d750a569081f5d374ae0d61b1f53521c59/0_149_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cc7c12b5d3765d78c6bb2f4d27b68321","title":"share your experiences of heading footballs","story":"We would like to hear from parents, current and former football players of their experiences of heading the ball playing sportA proposed ban on children under 12 heading the ball in training is expected to be announced by the Scottish Football Association.The report by University of Glasgow researchers, released last October, found that ‘among former players, mortality with neurodegenerative disease listed as the primary or a contributory cause on the death certificate’.A similar ban has been in place in the US since 2015 but would become the first European country to impose such a restriction.Whether you are a parent of a child who plays football, play football yourself or are a former player, we would like to hear from you.

But a host of artists have recently focused their attention on the experiences of women in midlife, from Darcey Steinke’s Flash Count Diary to Susan P Matterns’ The Slow Moon Climbs.This new wave of attention is joined by photographer Elinor Carucci’s Midlife. In her introduction to the book, Kristen Roupenian writes that Carucci’s photographs invoke the “intense, exhausting self-monitoring that can feel like an inescapable part of owning a female body”.I met with Carucci in the kitchen of her lower Manhattan home, where so many of her photographs have been taken. We talked for more than two hours while her twin teenagers visited with friends in a room down the hall.Ann Neumann: What became very clear to me in menopause is how much of a woman’s value to society is determined by her appearance. Whatever currency my appearance once gave me, it was quickly changing, making room for other interests and concerns. There’s a kind of bravery to showing your true ageing body. Elinor Carucci: I don’t really see it as me being brave. I mean, I was the class clown because I wasn’t a good-looking teenager my nickname was Wall because I didn’t develop. I became really funny and I was always making fun of my body. People say the work is brave and I take the compliment but I feel it’s more like an attempt at connection.AN: But there’s also a lot of beauty in the photographs: you’re beautiful.EC: Thank you, Ann, thank you.AN: And I know that helps your career.EC: It does.AN: How do you think of your own beauty?EC: I am a feminist, but I still want to look beautiful. I still want to look younger. It’s not like you’re either a feminist who doesn’t care about the way you look, or you’re a stupid, shallow woman who does.AN: When I turned 50 last year, I realized that I was relieved of the effort to participate in all the behavior that surrounds reproduction, looking a particular kind of attractive. I was afraid of becoming invisible, but also relieved that it was approaching.EC: You really look so much younger than 50.AN: Thank you! But also think about that!EC: As a compliment that we give each other … I know. I’m thinking about it a lot, but still I had to say it.AN: Ha! And then I say: “Thank you!”EC: We all want to look beautiful and there’s a reason for it. What has to change really is the opportunities we’re given as women – professional, economic. But I will probably want to be beautiful for the rest of my life.AN: So the way we define beauty is culturally constructed.EC: Very much so.AN: Even the types of attention that women’s work and men’s work receive can be different. We receive publicity and recognition through different routes. Routes that don’t confer the same respect.EC: And don’t translate into the same amount of money. I’m sorry to talk about money.AN: No, money’s important! We’ve already talked about the attention we receive, the attention that our work is given … But what about the attention that we women give to things and how this changes?EC: I’m just speaking my mind more. I approach and talk to people more. I say to my kids: “I’m not crazy guys, I’m just reaching out to the world.” I have fewer years as I grow older. Just let me enjoy the world.AN: In the afterword to Midlife, you write that red is the color of an “angry loss” that you feel. “My blood looked the same,” despite all of the other losses: being reproductive, being needed as a mother, being attractive, being visible, being relevant. “I am unnecessary, I am a woman without a uterus.” I felt this loss too. What recourse do we have as ageing women? Is the only corrective to thinking that our lives are less valuable now to say: “No they’re not.” I’m vital, I’m doing important work?AN: I loved that about your book because it’s about these eras within our lives and how we move through them and we embody these different roles. And embodiment means so much to me as someone who writes about death and dying, to see people at the end of their lives doing this measure of who they are, and what they are, and what it all means.EC: What does it all mean, then?AN: What do I think is the meaning of life?EC: What do you feel from them at the end of their lives?AN: Oh, everything! Every emotion, so much regret, so much anger, so much love and concern and fear. Often great calmness. I think about this a lot. It’s changed me to do hospice work, to write about the dying. First of all, I think I make better decisions.EC: Because you know that you can’t afford to lose time?AN: Because the unimportant things are very much clearer now. When you see someone on their deathbed and they wish they hadn’t worked so much, they wish they hadn’t let those bad relationships fester, they wish they’d made peace with their estranged siblings, they wish they hadn’t cared so much about what people thought of them, they wish they had just tried the crazy things.EC: The hysterectomy did some of that to me. It did have some of those effects on me.AN: Whenever we’re talking about life and the beginning of life and the making of life – motherhood, essentially – we’re talking about death. We’re talking about mortality, and that has very much been brought home to me in my work. The conversations that we have about elder care and death care parallel ideas about conception or the origin of life. The two always come together.I saw my sister give birth to my nephew and I suddenly thought about my own life and time differently. It shocked me, the birth. It’s brutal and beautiful and emotionally profound: the shit, the pain, the blood, the gorgeous new life.EC: The smell. The smell!AN: Very primal. Like a death."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/612650666facab7182722f84dc82f8f4aa58003d/0_194_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=16dfa16e20635af3ef17e4a7f3a02684","title":"why did former nissan boss carlos ghosn choose a life on the run podcast","story":"The former CEO of Nissan, Carlos Ghosn, was once one of Japan’s most respected business people.

With a sizeable Conservative majority, they know that victories in parliament will be sparse and instead are turning their attention to who should succeed Jeremy Corbyn as leader.  ’s political editor, Heather Stewart, has been following the race in which five candidates have made it over the first procedural hurdle: Keir Starmer, Rebecca Long-Bailey, Lisa Nandy, Jess Phillips and Emily Thornberry. With a general election not due until 2024, the eventual winner will have time to formulate an opposition policy platform, but can they improve on the consecutive failures suffered by Gordon Brown, Ed Miliband and Jeremy Corbyn? Also today: Prof John Abraham on the historic warming of the oceans and the dangers it presents to global ecosystems.

We always discover somewhere new, because if there’s anything Londoners can bank on in this mighty city, it’s plenty of wonderful places and trails to run – all offering an assortment of terrain, from knobbly hills to the smoothest footpaths.Ready? Get set, go ...Richmond ParkThe chance to watch deer roaming free is the usual draw of Richmond Park – a certified national nature reserve. Covering almost 1,000 hectares (2,500 acres), it is the largest royal park in London and feels like you’re stepping into a whole new world, especially if you hit the Tamsin Trail. At just over 7 miles (11 km), this well-trodden, gravelly path offers the kind of adventurous landscape that’ll convert even the most committed urban runner to the trail life. You get to enter the wild through woods and fields, and up a few moderate ascents.There are cafes and water fountains along the way if you’re using this as a long run and need a breather – or ert into the park’s woodland garden Isabella Plantation so you can stop and smell the flowers.South Bank and Victoria Embankment loopThis swift jaunt around the Thames reminds me why I call London home. I like to time a run early enough to avoid the tourists, who love the South Bank in particular. For a 5K loop, start at Blackfriars station, run south over the bridge, take a right on Upper Ground, then take another a quick right on to Marigold Alley. You’ll hit the riverside, so turn left to follow the Thames and you’ll get to tread along a flat path as you fly past Oxo Tower, the National Theatre and the surprisingly sandy beaches you can spot at low tide near the Royal Festival Hall. You’ll also catch the bright lights of the London Eye, before climbing the steps on to Westminster Bridge. Turn right under Big Ben so you are now going eastwards on the north bank of the Thames along Victoria Embankment. Stay on the riverside pavement, so you don’t have to stop to cross roads and you can enjoy the great views of the Thames and the City beyond. Check out Cleopatra’s Needle and – on the left – Somerset House, before crossing over the road at Temple station. Continue along the Embankment before finishing up at the peaceful Middle Temple Gardens.Hampstead HeathSimilar to Richmond Park, Hampstead Heath is a leafy, countryside-esque destination that offers escapism from the bustle of the city – but it’s especially my go-to when I’m in the mood to tackle some ruthless hills or to get a bit muddy on the heath’s countless trails. For an obstacle-filled adventure, I like to start from Hampstead Heath overground station, and venture into the heath from South End Road. Follow the path and you’ll soon spot Hampstead No 1 and No 2 ponds – in the summer, you might even be tempted to have a dip. Keep going until you see the path that runs between the No 2 pond and the mixed bathing pond the terrain will become wilder as you start to make the taxing ascent to Parliament Hill. Catch your breath as you take in an impressive view of the capital – you should be able to make out the Gherkin, the Shard and St Pauls Cathedral in the distance. I might do a few hill reps here, then seek out the stunning Hill Garden and Pergola, a hidden gem on the west side of the heath.Victoria ParkLike many runners in east London, I’m a massive fan of Victoria Park. From its vast fields and leafy avenues to the top-notch cafes and restored bandstand, Bonner Bridge, the Burdett Coutts fountain and new play areas, London’s oldest park is still going strong. The terrain’s also nice and flat, which makes knocking out a speedy run such a pleasure. Made up of two parts split by Grove Road, a full lap of the park covers just over 4km (2.7 miles) – but if you have more in your legs, slip on to the Hertford Union canal for eclectic scenes of street art and houseboats as you make your way towards the Lee Navigation. For another change of scenery, you can peel off towards the Olympic Park en route for a calisthenics gym and art installations commemorating the legacy of the 2012 Olympics.Tower Bridge to Islands Gardens via the Thames PathThe London leg of the Thames Path, a pleasant national trail that follows the river, is 79.5 miles (128km) that’s usually tackled in four sections either north or south of the water. Though the entire route is a beaut, the 5-mile (8km) passage from Tower Bridge to Island Gardens is particularly fascinating. The first time I ran along it, I was riveted by how it unveiled the capital’s Victorian past. You’ll head through St Katherine’s Dock and Wapping along cobbled lanes, fly past Execution Dock where pirates were once hung, and be tempted to swing by the Prospect of Whitby pub, once frequented by Charles Dickens. From here, you’ll soon notice how the capital has evolved as you make your way through Limehouse, the glass and steel of Canary Wharf and eventually Island Gardens, where the multi-surface path officially ends.Crystal Palace ParkThe ladies from the Fly Girl Collective ran their first ever race here, so it’ll always be remembered as “very, very hard” – but in a good way. The mixed, hilly terrain of this south-east London park is one of the reasons why it’s a big hit with trail-loving runners. It’s got everything – cheeky hills, grassy and stony paths, and muddy puddles after the rain. Another draw, of course, is the Grade I-listed Dinosaur Court – a quirky collection of more than 30 dinosaur sculptures that have resided in the park since 1854. To see them in all their glory, enter the park from Thicket Road entrance on the south side and do a half a mile (0.8km) loop around Lower Lake. Then, explore the rest of the park by taking the 2.5-mile (4km) circuit around its periphery, taking on some challenging hills, or seek out the infamous Crystal Palace Park maze for a fun ersion before heading back south past the athletic stadium, to swing by the park’s charming urban farm – the goats are particularly curious about passing runners.The Fresh Foam X Hierro v5 is designed to go the distance.

According to Nutt, the optimal dose is 5gm a day, which is about a third of a glass of wine or half a pint of light beer.Pubs do not serve 40ml measures of wine, he said, but he had a solution. “Order a pint or glass of wine and three straws and share it with two friends,” he said.Nutt argued that prohibition of drugs has frequently led to more dangerous substances arriving on the black market that kill more people, as far back as a ban on smoking opium, which led to addicts injecting heroin.“There’s never been a death in prison from cannabis, but last year there were over 60 deaths from spice,” he said. According to the former scientist, every prison now needs a team of paramedics on hand to deal with violence, seizures and heart attacks among those taking the drug.The government banned the first generation of synthetic cannabinoids, which had been developed for use in medicine and then the second generation, tested on animals. The third generation has never been tested, leading to a human experiment now taking place in prisons. The government wants to ban all chemicals that might look like synthetic cannabinoids, said Nutt, but it has been warned by pharmaceutical companies such as GlaxoSmithKline, which said it has an estimated 80,000 chemicals in its database that would become illegal.Nutt said the deadly rise of the opioid drug fentanyl was the result of an attempt by the United States to clamp down on street heroin by placing restrictions on the production of pharmaceutical heroin, believing if they capped production it would stop ersion.“So what did the black market do? It looked for alternatives,” he said. Fentanyl had been around for 30 years, but until then the black market had not worked out that it was 50 times as powerful as heroin and a third of the price to make. “So now the black market has moved into fentanyl,” he said. “Trying to stop people using heroin has led to this terrible monster of the fentanyls.”A newer form is carfentanil, which is even more deadly. Fentanyl is 50 times as potent as heroin, but carfentanil is 1,000 times as potent.Nutt also argues that the policy of banning psychoactive drugs like LSD and ecstasy has also put a block on research into their potential benefits as medicines in mental health conditions. “The only psychoactive substances allowed are alcohol, tobacco and caffeine – on the grounds of precedent, not harm,” he said.He also hit out at the “hysteria” over nitrous oxide, or laughing gas, which has an effect lasting just seconds and is much used to relieve childbirth pain. Yet the tabloids dubbed it “hippy crack”, with the result that the government has brought in a ban."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a421a061872e0f2d87ca66390ab6de72b4fdd39/342_427_4538_2723/master/4538.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=969cc3134715fe73c642ac620a2f03c2","title":"stephanie davis targets olympic marathon","story":"Stephanie Davis started taking running seriously only two years ago, raced in her first marathon in September 2018 and fits in training with a full‑time job. But the 29-year-old is now targeting an unlikely Olympic spot after being confirmed in the women’s elite field for the London Marathon.And who would dare bet against her? After all, in December Davis ran the ninth fastest marathon by a British woman – her time of 2hr 27min 40sec not only improving her personal best by five minutes but making her one of only four GB athletes with the Olympic qualifying standard of 2:29. The final step before booking the sporting trip of a lifetime is to finish among the top two Britons in London.“It has still not sunk in because it has all come so quickly,” Davis said. “My coach tends to give me mini‑motivational pep talks before and after training sessions. I haven’t had an international vest yet but with the Olympics just a few months away I can’t avoid the target.”Davis ran for the University of Edinburgh and continued to stay fit when she moved to London but it was only when she joined her local club, Clapham Chasers, that she started training more seriously.Her coach, Philip Krissi, encouraged her to run her first marathon in 2018, which she finished in 2:41, despite racing conservatively because she feared she would “get to six miles to go, hit a wall and die”. When she followed it up by running the London Marathon last year in 2:32, despite a hip injury in the buildup, she knew she was capable of more.Even so, this April will mark the first time she has started in an elite field rather than with the masses. “It will be a whole new learning curve but I am a very competitive person, which is what brought me that 2:27 in Valencia.“I thought beforehand that going under 2:30 was possible, so I got into a group where the pacer was meant to be doing 2:29-2:30. However, he went too fast and we were 50 seconds quicker at halfway but I was just really determined not to be dropped.”Unlike many of her rivals, Davis will not be heading away for altitude training – and says she runs only 60-70 miles a week, around half that of many elite athletes, to avoid injury. “But I also do a lot of cross-training, including swimming and going on the elliptical, and cycle to work every day.”Davis also credits her employer, Lazard Asset Management, with allowing her to work flexibly so she can train in the morning and evening.Her friends are also coming round to having a potential Olympic athlete in their midst, too. “For a while they were like: ‘Oh, she’s got so boring, she doesn’t want to come out any more and goes to bed early every night.’ But now they totally get it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b9ccfeff0fa38848f44aab8e6a38d948ba95bf50/0_111_2300_1380/master/2300.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b66f20b1cb32940253b44467e6a4d315","title":"f1 drivers without wealthy parents no chance lewis hamilton","story":"Increasing costs mean Britain may never produce a driver from an underprivileged background such as Lewis Hamilton againTalent now, more than ever, will take you only so far in motor racing. The ability to combine split-second decision making with almost ethereal reactions and sensitivity to an enormously complex piece of machinery has long set racers apart. But where once skill would be major the differentiator within their ranks, now it is money that seems to talk the loudest.This week the former driver Derek Warwick, the vice-president of the British Racing Drivers’ Club, warned that the increasing costs of racing meant that Britain may never produce a driver from an underprivileged background such as Lewis Hamilton again. Warwick fears many exceptional drivers will simply not progress unless they have a wealthy family.As young drivers in the UK cast around for seats in championships for the 2020 season, his concern seems valid. The numbers are stark. In 2016 the Mercedes team principal, Toto Wolff, gave his estimates of the costings. He said karting to international level could cost £1m, a season in F4 £350,000 and £650,000 for a season in F3. For GP2 (now F2) a further £1.5m.More than one season in any one series multiplies these figures and there was more to come. “You are on the verge of getting into Formula One but you are not there,” he said. “You need another £2m to £3m to get the drive.” He concluded by estimating a total of £8m. Four years later those numbers will have increased even further.Wolff’s calculations assume a driver has the backing to make it that far. The reality is few do, their careers curtailed long before the heady heights of F3.Johnathan Hoggard, who is 19, won the Aston Martin Autosport young driver of the year award at the end of last season. He finished the runner-up in the British F3 championship and Warwick describes him as a special talent. The award came with a £200,000 prize but while Hoggard acknowledges what an enormous help it has been, it is not nearly enough. Thus far he has been supported by his mum and dad, who have given all they can to meet the costs of British F3 – around £300,000. Hoggard wants to move to the F3 championship, two steps below F1. A drive which will cost at least £1m.“It’s not possible for mum and dad to fund it,” he said. “It was hard enough to fund British F3. They have brought me as far as they can but it is such a steep incline in budget. Before, the goal was F1 but I am having to think a bit more realistically about where we are and what we have available.”He is working hard to try to find sponsorship but that too is thin on the ground. Billy Monger, the double amputee driver with a high public and media profile, has still to secure sponsorship or a seat for this season.Further down the ladder the issues remain the same. Emily Linscott is a talented 17-year-old, who had wins in Britcar GT4 last year as well as podium finishes in the US Lucas Oil series. Thus far she too has been backed by her parents and wants to move to British F3 but the family can far from afford the step up.She, too, is trying to find sponsorship, knowing that victory on track is dependent on winning this numbers game. “Definitely finance is the biggest constraint,” she said. “I believe I have the skill to race but what’s holding me back is we don’t have anywhere near the money needed. My family have given their all but unless you have the money there is only so far you can go.”Popular conception has it that exceptional drivers will be picked up by development programmes. In some cases this is true but there are caveats. The first being that to be noticed you have to be racing and some cannot get that far. While equally, as the Jaguar Formula E driver Mitch Evans noted, even then it is not a free ride.“I had offers from a number of top teams, including Red Bull and Ferrari, to go on their junior schemes but I still had to provide some money,” he revealed in 2015. “A lot of driver development schemes are smoke and mirrors in terms of the drivers paying to be there. A lot of it is just about getting a foot in an F1 team in a roundabout way.”His words were given no little weight on Wednesday when Williams announced their test driver for the 2020 F1 season. Their choice, the Israeli Roy Nissany, has an underwhelming record, finishing 22nd in F2 in 2018. He is perhaps best known as being the son of Chanoch Nissany, who was the first Israeli to take part in an F1 weekend, testing for Minardi at the Hungaroring in 2005 where he almost 13 seconds off the pace and reportedly complained that his car had too much grip. His son is backed by the Canadian-Israeli billionaire Sylvan Adams and now has a place at the Williams team. What Hoggard and Linscott would give for such largesse.Hamilton has said he wants part of his post-racing legacy to include finding ways to encourage and support young drivers without wealthy parents into racing and in their careers. He also wants racing, including the FIA and F1, to consider the structures of the sport to make it more accessible.As things stand a mountainous task lies ahead and sadly for young talent across the globe, their chances may have long since slipped away."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/663d41b64b23f6536edcaba608a2dd2d083a78c6/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=56049e2e5e20a0cd084825912bc3de72","title":"south africa v england third test day one live","story":"41st over: England 89-1 (Crawley 32, Denly 10) There’s no need for England to hurry. Plenty of people think this pitch will crumble, subcontinental-style, so first-innings runs will be worth their weight in scoreboard pressure.“Morning Rob,” says J Wood. “That footage in the Australian dressing room is phenomenal. Is there a film coming out, do you know? I was, however, entirely depressed to hear the booing when Smith returned to carry on batting. I was there that day, and in my section of the ground, he got a standing ovation, so I didn’t hear any of that. Honestly, some people need to take a long hard look at themselves.” I assume it’ll be another of those Amazon sport documentary series. This one’s an exclusive – it’ll be worth watching!40th over: England 84-1 (Crawley 31, Denly 6) “Talking of David Steele, he was well-known to be careful with his money,” says Steve Hudson, “and had one of the better nicknames – ‘Crime’, because he never pays.”39th over: England 84-1 (Crawley 31, Denly 6) Paterson nips one back a fraction to Denly, who gets a thick inside-edge onto the pad. I think that was seam movement rather than reverse swing. I’m obsessed with reverse swing today. This is what happens when you read too many broadsheets. Paterson then tries the old one-two, a bouncer followed by a half-volley. Denly has seen it all before and drives sweetly between short extra and mid-off for four. He plays some gorgeous strokes.“I’m really confused by this morning’s events,” says David Bowden. “I’ve spent five years watching positive, front-foot cricket and yet weirdly I’m feeling more positive about our match prospects at lunch on the first day than at any point in the last decade (apart from maybe Trent Bridge 2015). Can you offer any explanation for this?”It’s the life-changing magic of the dot ball. 38th over: England 80-1 (Crawley 31, Denly 2) A reprieve for Denly, who drives Maharaj a fraction short - if that - of Elgar at short extra cover. Elgar swooped forward in an attempt to take the catch, but it reached him on the half-volley and he couldn’t get his fingers under the ball. It was an extremely difficult chance.37th over: England 78-1 (Crawley 30, Denly 1) The debutant Dane Paterson returns to the attack. He’s a reverse-swing expert, so keep your eyes on the shiny side. Nothing to report in that over, from which one run accrues. England are scoring at 2.1 per over, and it’s great. “I had a novel come out a while ago and had an Amazon reviewer give it one star and say it was awful,” says Pete Salmon. “I checked him out only to find that his only other review was of an electric toothbrush recharger. Four stars! In terms of utility the chap had a point, but it did take three years of my life.” Are you sure he didn’t get the reviews mixed up? I’ve never heard of an arresting, lyrical toothbrush recharger before.36th over: England 77-1 (Crawley 29, Denly 1) A maiden from Maharaj to Denly, who is off to his usual slow start. No that was a compliment.35th over: England 77-1 (Crawley 29, Denly 1) South Africa, control freaks that they are in the field, will be happy that England haven’t got away from them. England might lose two quick wickets now, but I would still prefer 903 in the 40th to 903 in the 25th. It’s a hot day, and if all goes well they will have the opportunity to punish South Africa in the final session. “Morning Rob, morning everyone,” says Robert Ellson. “I always enjoyed that remark of Peter Roebuck’s, that as Somerset’s no.4, his main job was to stay in long enough to prevent Richards (no.3) and Botham (no.5) batting together, lest counterproductive member-measuring should occur. In a not-really-similar way, I think Joe Denly’s role in this England side is simply to bat well enough to stop any talk of Root moving up from no.4. If Denly only averages 30, but Root goes back up towards 50, he’ll have performed a valuable service to England.”Yes, I agree. History will be very kind to him, I think. He’s the David Steele de nos jours, hashtagtheprettyboywhowenttowar. 34th over: Kent 75-1 (Crawley 28, Denly 0) Nobody knows whether he’ll make it or not, but there is a lot to like about Crawley’s game. He plays with a breezy confidence, and his bat seems to have an appreciable middle. He’s also light on his feet against the spinners, as he shows by dancing down to to drive Maharaj for a single. “Hi Rob,” says Neil Harris. “What was Brendon McCullum’s strike rate as an opener?”It was 61 in Tests, though most of those innings were played pre-epiphany. His last innings as an opener was 202 from 188 balls against Pakistan.33rd over: England 74-1 (Crawley 27, Denly 0) “I did look at those customer reviews of The Judge,” says Matt Dony. “My favourite was the one that said ‘I bought it as a present, so I haven’t read it.’ And then awarded the book 4 stars.”Which, SINCE YOU ASKED, brought the blOODY AVERAGE DOWN. 32nd over: England 74-1 (Crawley 27, Denly 0) Crawley survives an LBW appeal from Maharaj - it was missing leg - and then puts him away to the midwicket boundary. Another good over from Maharaj, who looks like his old self today.31st over: England 70-1 (Crawley 23, Denly 0) That was such a good over from Rabada, who created something out of nothing. Sibley had already survived two false strokes - one landed just short of midwicket, the other flew past gully at catchable height - and was sufficiently unsettled that he got out to the last delivery. Brilliant bowling from Kagiso Rabada! He troubled Sibley throughout the over before dismissing him with the final delivery. Sibley flicked a shortish ball towards short backward square leg, where Elgar ed forward to take a nice catch.30th over: England 64-0 (Crawley 23, Sibley 30) Crawley edges Maharaj wide of slip for a couple. I don’t think it would have carried anyway, but it was nicely bowled. South Africa will back him to at least hold an end - and maybe pick up a couple of wickets - while they wait for the ball to reverse.“This may be the first time in nine years that England have batted through the first session,” says Felix Wood, “but in more recent memory they were no wickets down at lunch on the first day...”It took me a while to get that.29th over: England 62-0 (Crawley 21, Sibley 30) Rabada, the pick of the bowlers before lunch, returns to the attack. Crawley continues to play with discipline and restraint. In the second innings of the last Test he made a skittish 25 from 35 balls today he has 21 from 86.“Some other nerd has probably got here first but...” begins John Horsley.“As a baseline: Boycott’s strike rate in Tests: 39.8.Slater’s strike rate in Tests: 53.3Gordon Greenidge strike rate in Tests 60.3Virender Sehwag strike rate in Tests: 80.”  For me, Clive, it’s about influence, timing and symbolic moments. Sehwag was completely absurd, and I doubt there will ever be another Test opener like him. And some of Greenidge’s shots are scary on YouTube, so goodness knows what it was like to bowl to him. But I’m not sure either had the same influence on their peers as Slater. That said, it might just be that a) I’m an England fan, and he routinely battered them and b) I was an impressionable age during his golden years. 28th over: England 61-0 (Crawley 20, Sibley 30) The left-arm spinner Maharaj starts after the interval. There was a snifter of turn before lunch, more than you’d expect in the first session of a Test, and a couple of deliveries straighten promisingly to Sibley. A maiden.“Roy Fredericks was no slouch,” says Andrew Harrison. “Would love to have seen his 71-ball ton against Lillee and Thomson at the WACA.”This is a lovely piece, from Andy Bull, on that innings. It’s such a shame that almost all of the footage of that series, including the Fredericks innings, was lost in a flood in the 1980s.“I reckon Warner’s true antecedent was Keith Stackpole, a burly Australian who gave the ball a hell of a thwack,” says Mike Jakeman. “Also gave plenty of chances to the fielders, too.”And he had one of those clever nicknames: Stacky.“Regarding fast-scoring openers…” says Steve Hudson. “Wot, no Sehwag? No Jayasuriya? As for early examples of this style, how about Bob Barber in Aus in 196566?”Sehwag and Jayasuriya came after Slater, though obviously before Warner. Bob Barber is an excellent suggestion, although he didn’t do it for long enough to have a wider influence. I think Slater had the biggest global impact.27th over: England 61-0 (Crawley 20, Sibley 30) That’s lunch. I’m not certain, because I’m not, but I think this is the first time since the Oval Test against India in 2011 that England have batted through the first session of a Test without losing a wicket. Nine years, man!Zak Crawley and Dom Sibley played with patience and commonsense on a very slow pitch, and their partnership has given England a great chance to take control of this match in the first innings. South Africa need reverse swing, and fast.26th over: England 61-0 (Crawley 20, Sibley 30) “Morning Rob - I thought we’d agreed never to mention Michael Slater again?” says David Horn. “(We didn’t actually, but it’s an unspoken pact I have with OBO’ers) He did more than break opening. He broke an entire cricket following nation in one over (one ball, really) in 1994, and he broke me. I was 21, had just started working in Big City, thought anything was possible, and then Michael Slater broke everything. To cap it all, Simon Burnton’s piece reminds me every time I’m feeling particularly masochistic.”I was unemployed at the time so planned to stay up all night. I honestly almost went to bed after one ball, and I did go to bed after Martin McCague’s first spell disappeared all round Brisbane.25th over: England 59-0 (Crawley 20, Sibley 28) Crawley, a naturally attacking batsman, has played with impressive restraint. In fact his strike rate today (26) is less than half his career strike rate in first-class cricket (58). He knows this is a rare opportunity to bat long - and maybe even do that - in a Test match.“The English idea of ‘nicknames’ is not really a nickname at all,” says Andrew Webber, aka Lloyd. “Nicknames should have some thought, humour or association given to them as we Aussies do. Jason Gillespie was named Dizzy in association with the trumpeter. Steve Waugh was called Tugga for a while. Mark Waugh named Junior as the younger Waugh twin. Beefy Botham passes the test as a big man of ox like stature and heart...”If that’s not an opportunity to brazenly plug The Judge by Robin Smith (look at those customer reviews!), then I don’t know what is.24th over: England 56-0 (Crawley 19, Sibley 26) Crawley survives an LBW appeal after missing an absent-minded paddle sweep. It brushed the glove and hit him outside the line anyway. Hamza, at slip, ran across towards leg slip in an attempt to intercept the sweep. Had he stayed in position at first slip, he would have had a good chance of catching Crawley.Sibley is beaten by some sharp turn later in the over, which will encourage both Maharaj and Dom Bess.“That 1938 Oval scorecard is some scorecard,” says Sam Collier. “I was, however, momentarily left wondering who Hardstaffjnr was and whether he was the only Icelandic volcano ever to bat for England... It’s still early.”23rd over: England 54-0 (Crawley 18, Sibley 25) Nortje jags one back to hit Sibley in the stomach. A few deliveries have taken the openers by the surprise, but generally it’s been a lovely morning on which to bat. Sibley gets his fourth boundary later in the over, deliberately uppercutting Nortje over the slips.“The BBC cricket social is wondering if England openers are too boring…” says Thomas Whiteley. “I blame David Warner. He broke opening the way Gilchrist broke wicketkeeping.”I’d argue it was Michael Slater, though you could go further back and make a case for Gordon Greenidge and Kris Srikkanth. 22nd over: England 50-0 (Crawley 18, Sibley 21) The left-arm spinner Keshav Maharaj comes into the attack. There’s some encouraging early turn to Crawley, who plays out another maiden. That’s the seventh of the morning.Thanks, meanwhile, to Gary Naylor for this link, about which I am officially excited.21st over: England 50-0 (Crawley 18, Sibley 21) Nortje, who has changed ends to replace Rabada, starts with a maiden to Sibley. It’s been a dull morning, but that suits England just fine.20th over: England 50-0 (Crawley 18, Sibley 21) Crawley thick-edges a back-foot drive for four, which brings up a serene fifty partnership. But then Philander reminds us all of his threat with a beauty that seams past Crawley’s outside edge. At least I think it was seam movement, though it may have been reverse swing.19th over: England 46-0 (Crawley 14, Sibley 21) South Africa’ fielders are throwing the ball into the pitch, trying to rough it up so that it will reverse swing. It does usually reverse here. South Africa desperately need it to do so, because Crawley and Sibley are in complete control.“Is it too soon,” says Kim Thonger, “to mention the highest ever England opening partnership of 359 by Len Hutton and Cyril Washbrook in South Africa in December 1948?”I’ve already bookmarked the Oval Test of 1938.18th over: England 43-0 (Crawley 12, Sibley 20) Philander replaces Nortje, which means a change of ends from his new-ball spell. His first ball beats Sibley outside off stump the rest is harmless. England are progressing with disconcerting comfort.“Morning, Rob,” says Smylers. “England’s top three must be causing havoc with their long-standing nickname policy of just adding -y to players’ surnames. Have you heard on the stump mic how they’re coping? Has anyone attempted ‘Sibbleyey’, ‘Crawleyey’, or ‘Denlyey’?”Isn’t the rule that if the name ends in Y, you change it to -ers. Like, erm, Smylers?17th over: England 43-0 (Crawley 12, Sibley 20) Rabada strays onto the pads of Crawley, with the ball zipping away for four leg-byes. Nothing much is happening for South Africa, and I wouldn’t be surprised if Faf du Plessis turned to spin before lunch.16th over: England 39-0 (Crawley 12, Sibley 20) Too straight from Nortje, and Sibley drives imperiously wide of mid-on for four. Shot! “It’s a really slow deck,” says Mike Atherton on Sky. “As an opener, when you’ve got past the new ball, you’re saying, ‘This is the day. This is my day.’”“After reading your comments about the Basil D’Oliveira trophy (5th over) I had a close look at a picture of it,” says Kevin Holloway. “I was surprised by how little the bust, to my eye, looks like the great man. Even the hair is parted on the wrong side - I think? It occurred to me that the sculptor might have googled D’Oliveira and mistaken a photo of Dolly’s son, Damian, for a photo of Dolly …”Oh my, you’re right about the parting. I still think it looks like him, mind.15th over: England 33-0 (Crawley 12, Sibley 14) This looks like an excellent opportunity for England to bore South Africa’s bowlers into submission. Sibley, in particular, has the perfect temperament to bat in conditions like this. If the ball doesn’t reverse swing, it could be a long day for South Africa.“Hi Rob,” says Billy Mills. “A bit cheeky, I know, but any chance of a shout-out for Ireland’s win over the Windies in the T20 last night, and especially for Josh Little’s nerve-shredding last over? I know it’s not really cricket, but as an Irishman, we’ll take what we get!”Not cheeky at all – that was a seriously impressive win against a very strong West Indies side.14th over: England 30-0 (Crawley 11, Sibley 13) Sibley repeats his stroke in the previous Nortje over, waving a cut through backward point for four. He has started superbly. Right here, right now, Sibley has a Test average of 41.16. Some people wanted him dropped, never to be seen again, after the New Zealand tour. That’s drinks.“Have England ever had two openers with three-letter forenames?” says Daniel Harris. “Yes, Dom is Dominic, but Cricinfo have him down as Dom. I don’t think it’s a proclivity.”How about a two and a three, Mo Ali and Jos Buttler in that runchase in Pakistan in 2015-16? Alright, alright, how about Len Hutton and Reg Simpson? I think they opened together in that Brisbane fiasco in 1954-55. 13th over: England 26-0 (Crawley 11, Sibley 9) That errant pull stroke aside, Crawley has looked fine against Rabada so far. Rabada’s line has been immaculate, but so has Crawley’s judgement of off stump.12th over: England 26-0 (Crawley 11, Sibley 9) Anrich Nortje replaces the debutant Dane Paterson, who bowled a reasonable first spell of 5-0-10-0. His second ball is steered crisply through backward point for four by Sibley. With no pace in the pitch and little movement, this looks like a beautiful day for batting. But we’ve said that before with England, is it not.“Former Essex and Notts batsman Will Jefferson - now there was a tall opener,” says Ian Forth. “He played on an England A tour but never quite fulfilled his potential, partly perhaps because he was 6 foot 10 inches tall. I seem to remember Tom Graveney was pretty tall too - certainly by the diminished stature of Englishmen in a country on 1950s rations.”Jefferson used to bat with James Taylor, which must have played havoc with the bowlers’ lengths.11th over: England 22-0 (Crawley 11, Sibley 5) Rabada has started excellently, with a challenging line just outside off stump. Sibley steals a single into the off side to move to five from 28 balls. As ever, he has crawled out of the blocks. No, that was a compliment. “England have now gone 35 Tests without naming an unchanged side (including the batting line-up),” says Chris Parker. “Funnily enough the last time we did it was the 4th Test vs SA, but that was the home series back in August 2017.”While I will fight any man who rejects the life-changing magic of a good stat, I would say that if they pick the same XI it’s an unchanged side, regardless of any tweaks to the batting order.10th over: England 21-0 (Crawley 11, Sibley 4) The pitch looks pretty slow, as promised, and Crawley mistimes another pull stroke. This one, off Paterson, fell just short of mid-on. 9th over: England 19-0 (Crawley 9, Sibley 4) Rabada comes on to replace Philander, not Paterson. He won that compelling contest with Crawley in the second innings of the second Test, and almost picks him up again here. Crawley mistimed a front-foot pull that teased Nortje, running back from mid-on, before dropping just in front of him. Careful now.“Hello Rob,” says Matt Doherty. “From memory the only other tall openers were Chris Broad and Tim Robinson.” Oh yes, good one, although strangely they hardly ever opened together in Tests.8th over: England 17-0 (Crawley 8, Sibley 4) The Paterson decision hasn’t really worked for South Africa. He hasn’t bowled badly he just hasn’t found much movement off the pitch or in the air.7th over: England 14-0 (Crawley 7, Sibley 3) Quinton de Kock has moved up to the stumps for Philander to stop Crawley batting outside his crease. The result is a maiden. England’s young openers - Crawley 21, Sibley 24 - have started calmly, although South Africa’s decision to hold Kagiso Rabada back has helped.6th over: England 14-0 (Crawley 7, Sibley 3) “With Crawley and Sibley both looking like at least 6ft4, is this England’s tallest ever opening partnership?” says Oliver Haill. “And is there any significance in that?”Climate change. Actually, it might be the tallest. Tony Greig never opened for England, and I can’t think of any particularly tall openers. Cook and KP at Headingley in 2012 maybe.5th over: England 12-0 (Crawley 7, Sibley 1) A rare piece of filth from Philander, short and wide, is larruped to the cover boundary by Crawley. Whether in attack or defence, the ball makes a lovely sound off Crawley’s bat.“Morning Rob,” says Richard Vale. “Am I alone in thinking that the Basil D’Oliveira Trophy being a bust of the man himself is just weird?”Hmm, I don’t know. At least it actually looks like him, which is a rarity these days.4th over: England 8-0 (Crawley 3, Sibley 1) Not a great over from Paterson. He was too straight, which allowed a couple of singles into the leg side and then four leg byes when the ball flew to the boundary off Sibley’s pad. 3rd over: England 2-0 (Crawley 2, Sibley 0) It looks like a clammy day in Port Elizabeth, though it’s not always easy to discern conditions in South Africa when you’re in an office approximately 9.371.6 miles away. There’s a bit of grass on the pitch, as is usually the case in South Africa on the first morning, and Crawley is beaten by a glorious delivery from Philander that nips away off the seam. Only Steve Smith would have nicked that. The rest of the over is defended confidently.Good stuff from the Sky Sports team, who use the popular split-screen medium to demonstrate that Crawley has made a technical change, with his bat coming down much straighter.2nd over: England 2-0 (Crawley 2, Sibley 0) Well I’ll be damned. Dane Paterson, rather than Kagiso Rabada, will share the new ball. That’s an eccentric decision, though I’m sure South Africa have a plan. His fourth ball is a beauty, shaping away to beat Sibley’s defensive poke. We have seen Paterson before, by the way - he gave a death-bowling masterclass in a T20 at Cardiff three years ago.1st over: England 1-0 (Crawley 1, Sibley 0) Philander’s second ball nips back sharply to hit Crawley on the thigh pad, and the third takes a thickish edge before falling short of third slip. Immaculate stuff from Philander, as always. Crawley then works a single into the leg side to put England 1-0 up.“Looking at Joe Root’s England blazer alongside the natty South African equivalent, I was immediately struck by how plainly classical it looks,” says Tom van der Gucht, If you ask me, although judging by my own sartorial crimes against humanity you probably shouldn’t, the ECB need to invest some of the money being blown on The Hundred in some extra trimming on their jackets. Nothing too garish: perhaps just a couple of gold rings around the cuffs and something along the lapels. Who knows, maybe it would empower Root’s leadership if he resembled a young Captain Birdseye.”Insert your own can-he-grow-a-beard-yet joke here.Here we go. Vernon Philander has the new ball, Zak Crawley is in the interrogation room. This will be a challenging morning for England.Now this is how to start a Test match“Morning Rob,” says Tom Bowtell. “There is a tantalising chance of an era-defining statgasm this morning. If Philander concedes 24 runs without taking a wicket, his career figures will read 222 wickets @ 22.22. It rather tarnishes Big Vern’s career that he lacked the foresight and basic human decency to have scored 171 fewer Test runs which would have given him a current batting average of 22.22.”“Where do you think Chris Woakes is at the moment?” says Kevin Wilson. “He’s the least talked up of any of England’s quicks. He’s been in and out of the side and bowled well in Hamilton and was reasonably decent in the Ashes. But even when he’s played, it feels like Root underbowls him. He’s the natural replacement for Anderson with the new ball. I’m fine with Wood coming in as I think some extra pace will be needed, but the decision you need to make is around the new ball. Would Woakes be more effective with the new ball than Sam Curran?”His illness has made this tour a bit of a write-off. He’ll always be a good option, especially at home, and I thought he was poorly managed during the Ashes. But I’d say England are right to use Curran for now. Woakes is 31 in March and has a chronic knee injury it wouldn’t shock me if Anderson outlasted him as a Test player.Both teams make one change, with each bringing in a skiddy fast bowler. South Africa give a debut to Dane Paterson, who replaces the allrounder Dwaine Pretorius. England bring in Mark Wood for the injured Jimmy Anderson.“It looks a good surface, dry underneath, and it could deteriorate,” says Joe Root.Faf du Plessis, who has now lost six tosses in a row, says he would also have batted, though it was a 6040 call.Hello and welcome to live, over-by-over coverage of the third Test between South Africa and England at Port Elizabeth. Let’s start with something thrilling, a list of scores: 1-1, 1-0, 2-1, 2-1, 2-2, 1-2, 1-2, 1-1, 0-2, 1-2, 3-1. Those are the series results between these sides since South Africa were readmitted in 1991. No whitewashes, not even a rout, and only three dead rubbers in 11 series.South Africa and England have been the most well-matched sides in world cricket in the last 30 years. Some might say that’s because they’re essentially the same team, but that’s one for the  Sport SuperBrains to consider. What we can say with confidence is that contests between the two usually come with a guarantee of tense, hard-nosed, occasionally brilliant cricket.This series, which has been no different, will end with back-to-back games at Port Elizabeth and Johannesburg. If you believe in the M word, then England have it after their stirring victory in the second Test at Cape Town. But they will be without one of the stars of that match: Jimmy Anderson, who had frankly absurd match figures of 37-15-63-7, has flown home with the latest manifestation of professional old age.His like-for-unlike replacement will be Mark Wood, who has been bowling like the wind – or even the Typhoon – in the nets. Port Elizabeth has a reputation for being the slowest pitch in South Africa, so England want what we are now obliged to refer to as an X-factor bowler. There has been plenty of talk of reverse swing, too. Slow pitch or not, I doubt the next few days will be dull. After all, it’s England v South Africa.The match starts at 8am in England, 10am in Port Elizabeth."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/675bb2ca0333ee42d91f6e99c34131bf14be197c/0_53_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=416d8e8096a0adb5df6c453277b0d51d","title":"cirque du soleil luzia review royal albert hall london","story":"Royal Albert Hall, LondonThe Canadian company’s colourful Mexican-flavoured show is full of heart-stopping skill, dreamy lyricism and visual whimsyMany contemporary circus groups sell themselves as the anti-Cirque du Soleil, the international entertainment juggernaut standing as a symbol of slick, some would say soulless, spectacle. And the Canadian company certainly trades in spectacle. Who else has the capacity to create a vast waterfall the height of the Albert Hall, on which giant images and symbols magically appear? And yes it is slick, although it masks the machine-like workings with visual whimsy and a dressing-up box aesthetic. Luzia’s theme is, broadly, Mexico, with no plot as such but a palette of saturated colours and inspirations from Aztec gods to magical realism to football (in the form of a mighty impressive display of keepy-uppy).On such a grand scale, there’s inevitably a level of generic anonymity, here backed by Mexican-flavoured world muzak and a bit too much clown filler. But Luzia is one of the company’s stronger shows and also brings surprises and engaging, tongue-in-cheek characters: a scene of old-school movie glamour with handstander Ugo Laffolay playing a lifeguard in a retro swimming pool, and a man dressed in a lucha libre wrestling mask on a giant swing looping the full 360. There’s inidual artistry, too. Two graceful women on cyr wheels (like doing cartwheels inside a giant hula hoop) have a dreamy lyricism that makes their act like an extension of emotion rather than a demonstration of skill.Most joyfully awesome to witness is the swing-to-swing: two huge swinging platforms that acrobats launch themselves between, twirling, twisting or just seemingly floating, suspended high in the sky. This is the effortless, heart-stopping skill you go to see Cirque for – the times when bigger really is better."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2ff0a1cc151d0406901b855e58d68de365603bcf/470_475_3968_2381/master/3968.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=81cced589714d6d03adac026a2c6ec45","title":"google nest mini review bass sound smart speaker","story":"Upgrade keeps what is good and improves sound for Google’s smallest, cheapest smart speakerThe second generation of Google’s smallest smart speaker gets a new name, more eco-friendly, a little smarter and more bass.The £49 Nest Mini replaces the Google Home Mini as part of a revamped and renamed line of Google smart home products under the Nest brand, pushing its predecessor to a clearance price of only £19.From the outside you would be hard pushed to see what has changed. The Nest Mini sticks with the same pincushion design with a fabric top and nonslip rubber pad on the bottom.The top contains three far-field microphones and is touch sensitive. If music is playing, approaching the top with a hand lights up the LEDs to show you the volume and where to tap using ultrasound presence sensing.Tapping on the left or right edge adjusts the volume, while tapping on the four central LEDs pauses or plays the music.There is a mic mute switch on the bottom as well as a new hole for mounting the Nest Mini on a wall.The Nest Mini also has a new faster machine learning chip built into it, which is part of Google’s push to do more natural language processing locally for better speed and privacy. It also has a new wake word engine, which is designed to prevent accidental activation of Google Assistant while still enabling it to hear you from across the room.I certainly noticed a reduction of accidental activations in a similar to that of the recently launched Google Nest Hub Max smart display. The less smart speakers are activated the less chance that they inadvertently capture speech you’d rather they didn’t.Google has also upgraded the speaker, which it says produces twice as powerful bass. It certainly has a bit more punch in the low end and a more rounded sound than the Home Mini.Vocals are clear, Google Assistant sounds great and details only start to get lost a little bit at maximum volume.It is still a small speaker and cannot quite produce real, room-filling sound but it is pretty good for what it is – I enjoyed listening to it more than I anticipated.Google Assistant natively supports music playback from Spotify, YouTube Music, Google Play Music, Deezer, BBC and other radio stations in the UK. You can also either Chromecast to the Nest Mini or use it as a Bluetooth speaker, both of which worked well from Android devices and iPhones.Google’s voice assistant continues to lead the pack in terms of natural language understanding and capability.Teach it your voice and it can distinguish between users, giving personalised results pulling from information in your Google account such as your calendar.It will answer most questions, set timers and everything else you would expect from a voice assistant in 2020, including controlling most common smart home devices such as lights.Google recently rolled out a male voice for Assistant in the UK, allowing users to switch it over from the default female voice on a per-account basis. The UK still lags behind the US, however, in its choice of voices.The Google Nest Mini costs £49 and is available in four colours: chalk, charcoal, coral and sky. It is also frequently discounted to £34 or less.The Google Nest Mini is a future-proofing update rather than a radical change. Sure, it sounds a little better, the controls are improved and the wall-mount is nice.But it is the improved machine learning chip within it that is the real upgrade – and one that is likely to be of larger benefit as we shift more and more of processing of our voices to local devices rather than Google’s servers. It is faster and better for privacy.So the Nest Mini continues to be an excellent little smart speaker that gives the dominant Amazon Echo Dot a very good run for its money.Just do not buy it at full price, given it is likely to be frequently and heavily discounted as with its predecessor.Pros: good sound for the money, wall mount, made of recycled plastic, Google Assistant, Bluetooth 5.0, native BBC radio playbackCons: No 3.5mm input, privacy concerns of a smart speaker, not quite room-filling sound This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

I’m in a relatively good situation and I’m not going to seize up my spending.’”So what have we been spending money on in 2019? This year, the Office for National Statistics added smart speakers, baking trays, dog treats and electric toothbrushes to the virtual shopping basket it uses to calculate the country’s annual inflation rate, making our changing shopping norms clear as day. And there are more consumer trends that refect our changing world …Vegan sausage rollsWhen vegan sausage rolls hit the high street in January, they caused something of a stir, with bakeries struggling to keep up with demand. Their success influenced supermarkets, many of whom expanded their vegan ranges. Shoppers say they’ve adopted this lifestyle in the past five years, primarily because of animal welfare concerns, health reasons and because they want to be more mindful about the environment.Hannah Elderfield, senior behavioural analyst at the consumer behavioural specialist Canvas8, says it’s part of an evolution of beauty as a sector that combines notions of self-care, wellness and health into one. “People are now looking for beauty products that boost their emotional state, rather than just buff out so-called imperfections – it’s about feeling happier, empowered and more confident,” she says. “Part of this shift is due to a rising desire for products that align more closely with people’s values. In 2019, environmental concerns and sustainability issues grew even higher on the agenda.”It’s part of a broader trend of shoppers who are investing more in their “off time” at home. Research from American Express found this extends to hobbies – 11 million adults having taken up a new one this year, with artistic interests such as painting, drawing and creative writing topping the list. The most common reason people gave for spending money on a new hobby (an average of £23.50 per month) was to find a better work-life balance. Experiences as a whole have remained a strong category in 2019 when it comes to consumer spending, whether that’s at home or elsewhere, says Duckett.“We’ve got so much stuff and no place to put it,” he says. “This has filtered down to us thinking: what else can I spend my money on that I can get more value out of. People will look for experiences in leisure, entertainment and holidays.”American Express Services Europe Limited has its registered office at Belgrave House, 76 Buckingham Palace Road, London, SW1W 9AX, UK.

I care because it’s my future.”Many young millennials and Generation Z are passionate about tackling the climate crisis, research shows. They also want to work at organisations that have a strong commitment to sustainability.Across the UK, young people like Dharni are working to create a healthier planet. For example, Sadie DeCoste, 23, is an analyst at E Co, a London-based consultancy, which works on low-carbon, climate-resilient projects. DeCoste says she’s always been interested in sustainability. “I’ve been really passionate about it since high school,” she says. “I find it meaningful and interesting.”Dharni and DeCoste both point out that young people have grown up in the internet age, seeing the impact of the climate crisis around them. “People our age care because we’re more educated on the subject,” DeCoste says. A recent report warned that 100 million more people could be driven into poverty by climate change impacts on natural disasters and agriculture by 2030 unless precautions are taken now.For this reason, many young people want to make a difference through their work. “If you’re going to spend such a big part of your life working, why wouldn’t you try to maximise your impact?” DeCoste says.McConnochie believes there’s only so much he can do as an inidual and wants to achieve more than that. “I’m a realist, I believe that as an inidual there’s only so much of an effect you can have. So taking up this role has allowed me to have the most influence outside of my personal actions. I’m able to work with some of the biggest housing associations and to start seeing some real significant change within them.”Other young people are founding their own companies or working at startups that offer alternative ways of doing things. Anna Lopez-Fujimaki, 22, works at Olio, a startup that connects neighbours with each other and with local businesses so surplus food can be shared, rather than thrown away. “I started at Olio in April and it’s been a wild ride,” she says. “I’m having my mind stretched by all these problems and solutions. I’ve been so busy – it keeps you on your toes.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6d9f8768153bc7ddb3c0ec7d6553bf7154eb5dc7/256_294_5297_3178/master/5297.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=221a7068887f4e9f8d9758e65a29266a","title":"bittersweet berlin goodbye clarchens ballhaus faces uncertain future lease","story":"The legendary club and ballroom joins a growing list of iconic city venues under threat due to lease renewal issuesBy the time the brass band came out blaring Bella, Ciao, the wooden floor was heaving under the weight of hundreds of revellers. Last Friday night, the rowdiest party in Berlin was at a century-old ballroom in the gentrified Mitte neighbourhood. Unlike at the city’s techno clubs, the guests queuing for Clärchens Ballhaus ran the gamut from grade-schoolers to retirees.“I’ve been coming here since 1983 and it looked pretty much the same then,” said Matthias Kühne. “There’s always been a mix of young and old, rich and poor on the dancefloor.”In a city that has undergone seismic cultural shifts in recent decades, Clärchens Ballhaus has remained a rare and anachronistic constant. The Spiegelsaal, its grand mirrored ballroom, survived the Third Reich, the GDR and illegal sword duels. During the second world war, the Nazis closed the Ballhaus, Russian troops used it as a horse stable, and an allied bombing raid obliterated part of the building.But after all it has endured, this raucous ball will be its last for some time. Last year, the landlord refused to renew the lease – a common tale that has shuttered or put numerous notable Berlin nightlife venues at risk, including the notorious KitKatClub. When news broke of Clärchens’ possible closure, the public outcry was immediate.“We’re leaving this place at a high-point. The last year has been so crazy – it’s been packed every night,” said Lisa Regehr, a dancer who has run the ballroom along with her husband, David and his business partner Christian Schulz. When the couple arrived in 2004, many of the windows were boarded up and debris littered the floor of the Spiegelsaal. Bringing it back from the brink of dereliction wasn’t easy, but they maintain it was worth it.“There may be people who are more financially successful than us but we never did this for the money. We’ve always viewed this place as a living work of art,” says David. “Under the GDR, everyone came here because this was one of the only places where you could dance.”There will be dancing in Clärchens’ future, although no one is sure what that will look like. Last year, Yoram Roth, the Berliner who is the majority shareholder and chairman of the Fotografiska (a centre for contemporary photography), announced he would be stepping in to save it.Roth says he is committed to preserving the institution’s historic character: “I’m deeply in love with the place. I want the building to look as though no one has touched it. You could restore it so that it looks flawlessly new, which I’d find soulless. To restore it so that it looks untouched will cost a lot more but it’s worth it because that’s what makes this place magical.” While some worried that the new owner may want to build condominiums on the valuable real estate out front, which currently houses a beer garden, Roth says that is out of the question. “If you put apartments everywhere, by right the owners can demand a certain quietude after 10pm, which runs into conflict with club culture. People come to Berlin to consume culture, whether that’s history, nightclubs or the opera. We have to support and maintain our club culture and Clärchens is part of that.”A petition attached to an open letter asking Roth to allow the Regehrs to continue overseeing operations has so far gathered 7,049 signatures. However, Roth says that he plans to work with a new, unnamed partner. Although he plans to host events and partially reopen Clärchens for the summer season, there is no fixed date for the venue fully reopening. More than 100 staff members will be let go with no guarantee of return.While the final festivities were bittersweet, David and Lisa insisted on a party rather than a funeral. As the night wore on, the two could be seen hugging regulars and greeting them by name.“These last two evenings are a celebration of this time and this place,” Lisa says. “So many guests have taken our hands and said, ‘Thank you so much for all the good times all these years.’”Looking for a holiday with a difference?

First stop: the world’s biggest car factory‘I’m Richard Hammond and I’m on a mission to explore the really big,” says our host at the start of this new series on Discovery. “And yes I know everyone seems big to me.” Hammond is 1.68 metres tall, and has spent most of his career looking up to Jeremy Clarkson (1.96m) and James May (1.82m), which is no way to live.I am not saying that Hammond has a Napoleon complex, still less that this series is a sublimation of his weekly humiliations on Top Gear and The Grand Tour, but it probably wouldn’t have been made were he taller. Indeed, it probably wouldn’t have existed if Clarkson and May had been cut down to his size in a car crusher like an obsolete pair of Morris Marinas, which would have been my preferred solution.In later episodes, Hammond will go up big buildings, pilot big ships and other examples of overcompensations for male inadequacy. But for this first instalment, he visits the world’s largest car factory in Wolfsburg, Germany, to make a puff piece so glowing that Volkswagen’s PRs must have been high-fiving each other when they saw it.For the rest of us, Richard Hammond’s BIG seems grotesquely misplaced. These, after all, are the end times. Clarkson’s Baldrick just doesn’t know it yet. “When you create enough cars each year to create a tailback from New York to Las Vegas,” Hammond says, “they have to be shifted off site as quickly as they are made.”That is why, he explains, each day 10 trainloads carrying 1,800 cars made by 4,000 robots with the assistance of 63,000 humans leave Volkswagen’s 6.5 sq km site. Each vehicle has passed through the world’s biggest paint shop where a crack cadre of robots wearing overalls spraypaints each car. Each one contains 10,000 parts from 600 suppliers as far away as Malaysia and Turkey. Top stats, Hammond. But hold on. What’s that noise coming from Sweden? It’s Greta Thunberg wailing over the madness Hammond celebrates. She collects those salty tears in a bowl and pours them into the Baltic. Why? To hasten the rise of sea levels and thereby the extermination of humanity. Hammond has that effect on people.We do not know whether any of VW’s robots get paid leave, but one has clearly been moonlighting. The script is devoid of human input. “You spend most of your time hanging out with robots?” Hammond asks Stefan Braun, the head of VW’s body shop. “Yes, that’s my life,” says Braun. “So you’re the lord of robots?” pursues Hammond. “Kind of,” says Braun with a fixed grin.Why are robots on the manufacturing frontline? “You get more out of a robot than you get out of humans,” Braun explains. Automation is happening in every sector. Hammond himself was replaced years ago by a robot, a rudimentary model programmed to giggle at white middle-aged male bants. Braun may be a cyborg, too, but a more sophisticated one. If VW is serious about productivity, he really ought to be.At least the robot scriptwriter has a sense of humour. “Next,” says Hammond before an ad break, “I get to work with the biggest tool in the factory.” Oh goody, I thought: Clarkson’s going to make a guest appearance. Fingers crossed the pair would turn Laurel and Hardy as they bungled fitting a rear spoiler to a VW Golf. Disappointingly, Hammond meant a different kind of tool.The Wolfsburg factory is so big it has its own sausage factory producing more sausages than Volkswagen makes cars. But unless robots like currywurst, the writing is on the wall for the head chef, Dietmar. To be fair, Dietmar has been making sausages for VW staff since 1973, so could probably do with a career change.Hammond never clinches the point that what goes on here shows our species is finished. We are not needed to make cars nor to drive them. We are on the hard shoulder of the highway to trans-humanism, sucking on the exhaust pipe of history. Viewed thus, this documentary is not a celebration of mass manufacturing but an update of Invasion of the Bodysnatchers.Did Volkswagen pay for what amounts to a 60-minute advertisement? Probably not, but it really should reward Hammond for helping us forget the VW emissions scandal. Instead of finding out how its R\u0026ampD geniuses cheated pollution tests, he plays the clown in a wind tunnel, standing in a harness as an eight-metre diameter fan blasts 32.11 megawatts of air at 160mph into his undulating face. “I can barely stand! I’m really glad I ate all that sausage earlier a bit of ballast to hold me down!”Top telly. They will be repeating this on Dave until the last viewer is terminated by a robot tasked with turning off the last TV. Just see if they don’t. It can only be a matter of time before BP sponsors an award for Tireless Dedication to Sanitising a Toxic Brand. It will be an outrage if Hammond doesn’t win it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a05566f48a9b0e7f95e3ef0830caeba1a2e9c230/8_0_3375_2025/master/3375.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=79d2cd14982d2a5f80f5657dbb5b71d6","title":"cheer netflix breathtaking bone crunching nerve racking magic","story":"Netflix’s cheerleading documentary is cracking TV. If you haven’t already front-flipped your way through the whole perfect series, do so nowIf you’re yet to watch Cheer, Netflix’s new cheerleading documentary, chances are it’s down to the subject matter. You might not understand cheerleading, or it might seem too positive for your curdled British mindset, or you might simply think you have no interest in it whatsoever. But let me tell you you are making a mistake. Cheer was created by Greg Whiteley, and that alone should be enough to make you watch.I understand your position perfectly. Whiteley’s last series was Last Chance U, which I had no intention of watching until I was forced to. “It’s about American football,” my editor told me. “You’ll love it.” I disagreed sight unseen, on the basis that I had never watched American football and didn’t follow or even understand American football.And yet Last Chance U is a flat-out masterpiece. It’s about American football, but it isn’t about American football. It’s about young people from troubled backgrounds trying to put their pasts behind them to achieve something incredible. When it works, it’s thrilling. When it doesn’t work – and it often doesn’t – it’s like watching a Shakespearean tragedy. All four seasons have been tremendous.But what’s becoming apparent now is that it was no fluke. Cheer replicates – even improves upon – the thrill of Last Chance U. It’s perfect. We’re 16 days into January, and it’s impossible to imagine that anyone else will make a documentary series as good this year.Rather than rah-rahing at the side of football matches, the subjects of Cheer take part in competitive cheerleading, which is arguably the most nerve-racking thing a person could ever watch. It’s a cross between high-level gymnastics and circus performing, with cheerleaders being flung metres into the air like rag dolls. Every time – every single time – they fell earthwards during the series, my sphincter clenched with fear. With good reason, because sometimes they land with a sickening crunch and end up horribly injured, but nevertheless that’s a lot of clenching.In time-honoured Last Chance U tradition, Cheer follows one high-ranking team – that of Navarro college in Texas – as they prepare for a nationwide competition. We see the agony of not being picked, the gruel of training, we learn the tragic backstories of some of the subjects and we become fully invested in the team as an entity.What Cheer lacks, arguably to its advantage, is the dark heart of Last Chance U. That show was underpinned by its two toxic head coaches, Buddy Stephens and Jason Brown. They were screaming, furious, too-masculine figures who tore about like a pair of sentient heart attacks destroying as much as they created. But Cheer’s head coach is Monica Aldama, who is a much more reassuring presence. Make no mistake, Aldama has a cruel streak – in one episode, she deliberately pushes a cheerleader to the brink of injury for defying her – but she proves time and time again that she isn’t like Stephens or Brown. She truly seems to care about the squad as people.This essential positivity bleeds through Cheer. Unlike many of the Last Chance U subjects, who have long since buried themselves under layers of machismo, the Cheer subjects are open and eloquent about their feelings. They pull together in times of trouble, and they’re ready to talk it out when things start to go south.Inevitably, they go south a lot. My pet theory about Whiteley documentaries is that, deep down, they’re all about parents. Last Chance U was about the moment you realise that a parental figure is mistreating you. Cheer is even more explicit. It seems like nobody at Navarro had a decent upbringing. Some have parents who are disinterested or out of their depth. Some are overbearing. Some are outright absent. All these people have broken families, and we watch as they discover that the cheer team represents an opportunity for them to build one of their own. It is an incredibly touching thing to witness.And, of course, it’s deliberate. Whiteley has an uncanny gift for knowing exactly when to drop a backstory into an episode to recalibrate our assumptions or explain a behavioural tic. He’s also able to structure the raw material of his footage into something that feels like a movie. When a catcher slips and a cheerleader smashes her head into the ground, we know objectively that it’s just a random accident. Whiteley’s gift is that he makes it seem inevitable, like it was always going to be a major plot point from the very beginning. I have no idea how he does it. It’s like a magic trick.So Last Chance U was no fluke. Cheer has proved that this is just the level Whiteley works at. If you haven’t seen Cheer, fix that immediately. If you have, you should wait with bated breath to see what Whiteley does next. I know that’s what I’ll be doing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a3acca226f1f7a5de2bc1e2e166ec53b498b61a2/0_16_1880_1128/master/1880.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b56bc0391b5e48d290cfb4ff1e98ebd0","title":"putins plans are all about keeping his hands on levers of power","story":"The looming question is not whether Putin will stay in control after 2024, but how he plans to do soVladimir Putin made two things clear as he embarked on a sweeping reshuffle of Russia’s government on Wednesday: first, that Russia will probably bid farewell to him as president after 2024. And second, that when he leaves the presidency, he will definitely not be leaving power.No one really expected Putin to retire in 2024, when term limits dictate he cannot run for re-election. But pride and an interest in self-preservation dictate that he keep his hands on the levers of power.“He is the founder of this system – he wants to keep control,” said Alexey Makarkin of the Center for Political Technologies.But remaking the presidency, which under Putin has enjoyed a singular and unchecked power, will take years.Boris Yeltsin sacks his cabinet and appoints Putin, a political neophyte who headed the main successor to the KGB, as his acting prime minister and heir apparent.Yeltsin stuns Russia and the world by using his traditional new year message to announce his resignation and hand his sweeping powers, including the nuclear suitcase, to Putin.Putin is prevented by the constitution from running for a third term as president. The First deputy prime minister Dmitry Medvedev is elected in his stead. One of his earliest moves is to appoint Putin as prime minister, leaving little doubt that the two men plan, at the very least, to run Russia in tandem.The blistering pace of developments on Wednesday – Putin announced plans to amend the constitution to weaken Russia’s next president, and then an hour later his prime minister and government announced plans to resign – showed that the groundwork for the transition is being laid years before Putin must leave the Kremlin under term limits.It is likely to end with him as prime minister or as the head of a newly empowered State Council, observers said, or in another role insulated from the power of his potential successor.That successor is not likely to be Mikhail Mishustin, the tax official whom Putin named as his choice for Russia’s new prime minister, and who is seen as an able caretaker of the government while Putin sets out his succession plans.Vladimir Putin’s selection for Russia’s next prime minister is a loyal technocrat seen as a capable placeholder while the Russian president plans for his political succession.Mikhail Mishustin, 53, is the head of Russia’s tax service, credited with bringing digital tools to revolutionise the agency and help it crack down on tax evasion.His nomination came on Wednesday as Putin embarked on a sweeping reshuffle of the country’s leadership. Mishustin met Putin in the Kremlin where the Russian president “suggested to him that he take the post of the head of government” which he accepted, the Kremlin said.He will face a vote of approval in the Russian parliament within a week, which is almost certain to pass.Mishustin, a graduate of the Stankin Moscow State Technological University, has headed the tax service since being appointed by Putin in 2010, and also worked for the agency in the 1990s.He has also worked as the president of an investment company and as the head of a laboratory for a Moscow-based computer company.A recent profile of Mishustin in the Financial Times called him the “taxman of the future” and credited him with developing a real-time system “directed more at shopkeepers than oligarchs.”Mishustin is not thought to be among the likely candidates to be Putin’s eventual replacement, who have largely included powerful officials known to be longtime allies of the president, including city heads, members of his presidential administration, and even former bodyguards.Meanwhile, a cast of loyal confidants, including old colleagues, aides, regional heads and former bodyguards, have all been tipped as potential heirs. Putin has left his options open with Mishustin’s selection, and sought to minimise infighting among the political elite by keeping his cards close to his chest.Putin has good reason to plan ahead for this transition, likely the most meaningful and fraught of his career. The 2011-12 protests, still the largest of Putin’s time in power, were sparked by botched parliamentary elections. But they came after Putin had announced his plans to return to the presidency, sparking concern among opponents that the Putin decade could become the Putin generation (it did), or potentially a lifetime of rule under Putin.That is also a possibility. Putin has already become the longest-serving Kremlin leader since Joseph Stalin, and by 2024, will be just six years shy of the Soviet leader’s three decades in power.Opposition leaders such as Alexei Navalny commented that Putin was interested in being “leader for life”. Mikhail Kasyanov, a former prime minister and Putin critic, said he wanted to retain power “for ever”.In Russia, the most pressing question is not whether Putin will stay in power after 2024, but simply how he plans to accomplish it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1094ffcc4666f5f0b7d787fe85e0cb6bbffca297/572_419_2727_1636/master/2727.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a2b07fc61753333b7dc5dfdd853ac941","title":"amsterdam green mayor reform red light district","story":"As an MP, Femke Halsema helped make prostitution legal in the Netherlands. So why does she now want to overhaul an area where sex workers famously ply their trade? The local football team, Ajax, had just won the championship, and as is traditional, the mayor of Amsterdam expected some abuse at the victory parade. “It is a Dutch tradition – it is usually just screaming and throwing cans of beer,”said Femke Halsema, the first woman to take the highest office in the Dutch capital.Halsema, 53, a former leader of the national Green party, though, faced a difference grade of barracking: shouts of “bitch” and “whore”, and a wall of middle fingers. “It was a moment when I was confronted by being a woman,” she said, laughing. “I think the last mayor wasn’t called a bitch.”If Halsema’s appointment by the left-led city council 18 months ago has discomfited some, it has not stood in the way of her quietly radical agenda, based on a philosophy that the longstanding Dutch tradition of tolerance could not mean turning a blind eye to the more pernicious consequences of letting the market rip.A central target of her reforms is Amsterdam’s infamous red-light district, the narrow streets that run around the city’s docks, where Dutch tolerance now risks looking more like indifference. “As Janis Joplin said, ‘Freedom is just another word for nothing left to lose’,” Halsema said. “Well, that’s not the way we are going.”In recent months the mayor has asked the city’s inhabitants to at least allow themselves to consider the red-light district’s closure as the most radical option of a bundle of possible reforms. At the same time, she has defended her “edgy city” and the window brothels, insisting she will not make a “taboo of sexuality … or of a woman’s body”.It is part of a wider agenda seeking to distinguish between a laissez-faire approach and the notion of tolerating difference that includes plans to work with companies in the hope of opening the eyes of the Dutch middle classes to the consequences of their cocaine use, having admitted herself to once giving it a try.“They should know or realise that the young boy who comes and brings their pizza and their cocaine is in danger of getting into a drug environment that is very dangerous to him, that could get him killed,” she said. “I used it once – I grew up in the east of Holland and there was not much to do except smoke cannabis.”Halsema is also casting around for lessons from other cities to help solve some of Amsterdam’s most pressing problems: Barcelona on dealing with the potentially fracturing impact of tourism on neighbourhoods New York’s Brooklyn on gentrification and, after a tip from London’s mayor, Sadiq Khan, during a visit to the UK, she has introduced a programme that has achieved success in Glasgow and Chicago in discouraging young men and women from being drawn into the grip of drug traffickers.But perhaps her initiative for the red-light district in Amsterdam best encapsulates her approach to dealing with the vastly changing nature of her city, where the population and economy is booming, in part due to Brexit relocations, but where seediness and criminality have also taken an unhealthy hold.Speaking in her City Hall office, Halsema said: “I am a progressive, a liberal. When I was a member of parliament ages ago, I was partly responsible for acknowledging prostitution as a legal profession in Holland.“And I am still in favour of accepting prostitution as a legal profession because I think the only way we can go to emancipate sex workers is to acknowledge that it is a market, there is supply and demand. But the red-light district has a sentimental flavour around it from the past – the idea of a sailor coming in and strong Dutch women telling him what he wants and doesn’t want.“But if you look at the actual situation in the red-light district, most women working there are foreign, in a very vulnerable legal status. And we do not know much about their backgrounds,” said Halsema.“The other big change is tourism. It is no longer an intimate district. If you walk through the very narrow streets, you see huge crowds of tourists standing in front of the windows photographing foreign women who are vulnerable and laughing at them.“As a woman, I cannot accept this kind of humiliation of women. I cannot accept it. It is against all women’s rights and against the idea that we want to empower sex workers.”The options include increasing the size of the district to deal with the overcrowding, to relocate some of the sex workers to a sex hotel, or to bring in turnstiles to force payment from those who want to walk on certain streets. As for closing the area down, she said: “I don’t think it is very realistic as it is also a very profitable district, so it would be very expensive to do that.”What she says is “non-negotiable” is that the women’s situation must be bettered, that those who live around the area are disturbed less and that criminality is not given an easy ride.“We call it brancheren – interfering with the economic branches of the city,” said Halsema. “In the last five or six years, the inner city has become an economic zone, while it is also cultural heritage. We need to rethink the main cultural significance of our inner city and what it means for the people who live in Amsterdam and Holland. We need to have the guts to interfere in the economic structures of the city. I think we are in time.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3ca9c1f0c95b656e462eb2b918847bdcb9ed3cd5/0_88_3249_1949/master/3249.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5ede059b19b2c56a0a96fc612abf6c8c","title":"brazil rio de janeiro tap water pollution","story":"The city’s water company insists the murky water is safe to drink and was caused by an organic compound found in soilJust weeks before hosting its world famous carnival – and with Summer temperatures soaring past 40C (104F) – Rio de Janeiro is on edge as residents across the city complain of murky and foul-smelling tap water.Scores of neighbourhoods in the city of 6.7 million people, as well as six nearby towns, have been affected by the crisis, which has dragged on for nearly two weeks.Social media feeds have been flooded with photos and videos of clay-coloured water, while supplies of bottled water have run low.The city’s publicly-owned water company has said the strange taste was caused by an organic compound called geosmin which is found naturally in soil, and insisted the water was safe to drink.But residents have complained of falling sick after drinking the water, and environmentalists blamed the crisis on polluted rivers, a lack of basic sanitation and decades of mismanagement.Emily dos Santos, 20, who works for an arts NGO, fell sick after drinking filtered tap water. “I had a fever and diarrhoea I vomited a lot for three days,” she said. “The doctor said it was bacteria in the water – and that lots of other people had come in with the same symptoms.”Cleaning up the city’s water and sewage was supposed to be part of its legacy for hosting the 2016 Olympics, but never happened.Cellphone technician Kamilla dos Santos, 28, who lives in Rio’s north zone, was sick for five days. “You can’t drink the water it tastes awful – like clay – and it has a terrible smell,” she said.Rio state’s governor Wilson Witzel tweeted that the situation was “inadmissible” and said he has ordered demanded a “rigorous investigation” into water quality and water company management. The water company CEDAE has sacked the manager of its Guandu treatment station which treats most of Rio’s water and said supplies will start returning to normal by next week.“Our results show the presence of geosmin, in sufficient quantity to change the taste,” its quality control manager Sérgio Marques told reporters on Wednesday.José Godoy, a professor of chemistry and water specialist at Rio’s Pontifical Catholic University said summer rains could have washed soil into rivers, causing an increase of geosmin. But the compound is also produced by the algae that thrive in polluted waters, said Mario Moscatelli, a biologist and environmental campaigner who has studied the city’s filthy waterways for decades. And the three rivers that supply the Guandu treatment centre, he said, are essentially “sewage gullies”.The crisis was “the sum of all the mistakes made in the last 50 years,” he said, noting that favelas lacking basic sanitation have grown up on rivers and blaming “uncontrolled urban expansion and lack of investment in basic sanitation”.Last July, Rio prosecutors signed an agreement with CEDAE to finish Olympic sanitation works which were frozen when the state declared a “financial emergency” weeks before the games began. Some projects have been completed but major works are expected to take four more years."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/76378882f266db5697a162767eabcfd90981909a/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=385878d405a2f1edd6263df36ccf1ae9","title":"hong kong could keep semi autonomy for longer says lam","story":"Leader says ‘one country, two systems’ deal could continue if city shows loyalty to ChinaHong Kong’s leader, Carrie Lam, has said the “one country, two systems” framework under which the city is meant to enjoy autonomy from China could be extended beyond 2047 if loyalty to Beijing is upheld.In her first appearance at the Legislative Council since October, Lam answered a question from a lawmaker about what might happen in 2047, the year the semi-autonomous territory is meant to return to Chinese rule.“As long as we uphold the principle of one country, two systems … we will have sufficient reasons to believe that it will not change after 2047, and it will continue to develop steadily for long in the future,” Lam said.Under the terms of the former British colony’s 1997 handover to China, Hong Kong is supposed to keep its freedoms and separate political system for 50 years. Critics say those terms have already been broken as Beijing’s influence over the city has grown under a local government backed by China.Lam said the recent months of protests would encourage Beijing to abandon the experiment, and said young Hongkongers should “treasure” the framework rather than “bring damage to this important system”.“Otherwise, they will be creating the situation that they are in fact worried about today,” she said, according to the South China Morning Post.Lam’s comments are unlikely to appease the protesters. During the question and answer session, several pro-democracy opposition lawmakers were ejected from the legislature after they shouted slogans and held up signs, including one that portrayed Lam as a vampire with bat wings.The protests have lessened in intensity over the last few weeks but residents continue to rally against the government, calling for an independent investigation into police behaviour and free elections, among other demands.Lam has repeatedly rejected the demands and on Thursday continued to support the police force. “I would not accept anyone accusing the police of brutality,” she said.

China pledged to buy more US products while the US called off additional tariffs on Chinese goods, among other measures agreed between the two sides.While the US president hailed the pact as “the biggest deal anybody has ever seen,” Chinese officials and state media described it in much more cautious terms.President Xi Jinping described the new agreement as a sign that the US and China can resolve their differences with dialogue, stating in a message delivered by Liu that the two countries had “made progress” and should “properly address each others’ concerns” to push bilateral ties on the “right track”.The comments are in sharp contrast with Beijing’s previous determination to “fight to the end” to defend its interests in the trade war.The often nationalistic state-run tabloid Global Times, whose stance on the trade stand-off have often been the most aggressive, said in an editorial: “The first phase of the agreement … certainly leaves both sides with regret and unhappiness, which is exactly the response that a fair agreement will elicit. Arguing who lost and who won is superficial.”On Thursday, Chinese media ran state reports that echoed Xi’s comments, with state broadcaster CCTV characterising the deal as “boosting people’s confidence” that issues between China and the US can finally be settled.“On the whole, the United States won a small victory,” said economist Shen Hong of the independent thinktank Beijing Tianze Economic Research Institute. “If the trade war continued it would definitely be more unfavourable for China.“This is better for China. It means the Chinese government finally realises that such compromises are good for China.”As part of the deal Beijing has promised to increase purchases of US products and services by an additional $200bn over the next two years. While the pact halts new tariffs, it leaves in place the bulk of levies on $360bn worth of Chinese products. Retaliatory Chinese tariffs on over $100bn in US goods also remain unchanged.Observers say that China’s muted response does not mean Beijing sees itself as having capitulated. Emphasising the idea of “mutual benefit” and “win-win” cooperation is a common trope in Chinese diplomatic language, often employed when talking about the Belt and Road Initiative.“The biggest things is to not appear to be capitulating to the US. This is a possibility because the government has spent a lot of effort to drum up nationalistic sentiments.”Observers have pointed out that the deal left out several of the thornier issues that have formed the basis of US-China trade frictions, from industrial subsidies for Chinese companies, forced technology transfers and stricter enforcement mechanisms.China’s pledge to buy more US goods also came with a key caveat. Liu said Chinese purchases of $40bn worth of US farm goods a year over the next two years would be “based on market conditions”.The US appeared optimistic about further talks, with the vice-president, Mike Pence, telling Fox Business Network that talks for a second-phase deal had begun.Chinese state media cautioned that these negotiations could prove even more difficult. The broadcaster CCTV said: “The more problems are resolved, the more intense the game becomes.”Additional reporting by Lillian Yang"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6300d104aa9a1a56c6da3d693f1cb2d555c3c3a9/557_22_5443_3266/master/5443.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a1f07c2ff93c904e3431712de3f0d29e","title":"conga and carnival havanas jazz festival in pictures","story":"New Orleans and Cuban musicians join in Havana’s annual jazz festival, defying Trump’s efforts to weaken US-Cuba relations"},{"url":null,"title":"college","story":"Can you put the facts about yourself together to see what picture may emerge?College application process can seem intimidating and complex \u0026ndash here\u0026rsquos how to do itA reduction in the artificially inflated range of choices would lead to lower drop-out ratesEmployers will be interested in your range of problem-solving and lateral thinking skillsParents\u0026rsquo perception of the education options for their children are often outdatedAs numbers of students choosing to study abroad increase, we look at the optionsThe costs of college are particularly high for students living in rented or student accommodationPrimary and secondary school may be expensive, but costs climb sharply at third levelWhat do Ireland\u0026rsquos universities offer students by way of sports and health facilities?Download PDFs of our comprehensive list of level 8 and level 67 courses"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Victim Keane Mulready-Woods had been missing from his home since SundayFour yellow wind warnings in place for Thursday with risk of floodingTraffic disruption expected as demonstration over price of beef to continueTent containing homeless man was \u0026lsquochecked verbally\u0026rsquo before being liftedGarda\u0026iacute suspect Keane Mulready-Woods (17) murdered as part of drug gang feudGermain became first woman to win Grand Prize in Mathematics of the Paris Academy of Sciences in 1816Sesame is likely one of the most successful examples of science diplomacy in operationMeasures used in exceptional situations where errors occur outside students\u0026rsquo controlMake sure to do your financial calculations before choosing a courseOne Leaving Cert student given estimated grade after complaining of ants on deskEuropean Commission chief says Ireland\u0026rsquos sovereignty magnified by EU in Brexit debateThe Khan family has been living in direct provision in Cork since leaving Saudi ArabiaJuvenile charged with seven offences including theft and dangerous drivingBritsh government had announced \u0026pound2bn to put Stormont on \u0026lsquosustainable footing\u0026rsquoAdmissions legislation comes into force from September 2021EU funds expected to help retrain workers at power plants like MoneypointUtility vehicle was removing tents pitched along the Grand Canal in DublinCounsel said the club was shocked by its suspension"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4141677.1579167179!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"temperatures set to plunge to 4 degrees over weekend","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tHighest temperatures of 4 to 7 degrees are expected on Friday.

The funeral was held at the Holy Trinity church in Whitestone, New York. Photograph: Lauren CrothersMcSorley’s Old Ale House, opened by Irish immigrant John McSorley in 1854, is the oldest Irish pub in New York, where sawdust on the floor provides a comforting crunch underfoot and walls are decked with mementos of yesteryear.The chair Abraham Lincoln is alleged to have sat on looks down over the bar, along with dusty fire helmets and the turkey wishbones eaten by men who never returned from war.This week, however, the mood in the popular East Village haunt in Manhattan is sombre, following the passing of its beloved long-time owner, Kilkenny-born Matty Maher, who was buried on Wednesday.His funeral on a bright, crisp morning on Wednesday was attended by hundreds of family and friends. His casket was escorted by two pipers from the New York fire department, and carried under an arch of hurleys.Mr Maher’s daughter, Andrea spoke of a man who loved “laughter, stories and song”.“Nothing ever held him down. He saw good in any situation,” she said.Paying tribute, Fr Tom Brosnan said tombstones usually have a hyphen between the deceased’s dates of birth and death: “Matty’s hyphen should be very long not because of the years he lived, but because of the things he accomplished in those years.”Mr Maher’s move to New York and eventual ownership of the bar was serendipitous, following a chance meeting in 1964 when he was just 25 with its then-owner, Harry Kirwan after Kirwan’s car broke down during a holiday in Ireland.The young Maher came to his aid, and the older publican promised the young Kilkenny man a job should he ever find himself in New York. Mr Kirwan was true to his word.Stepping into those shoes years later, one of Mr Maher’s greatest gifts was in knowing “all the regulars”, who included second World War veterans, but also in remembering people he’d only met once.Recalling his employer, the pub’s longest-serving barman, Jeff Bartholomew, hired by Mr Maher in 1972 when the latter was the manager, said: “He ran the taps. He was the nexus for the whole place.“He was one of those guys you’d really want to be in a foxhole with. He could see what was going on and he knew what was going on,” Mr Bartholomew, said on Tuesday before leaving for his old boss’s wake.‘Traditional Irish publican’Remembering one of Mr Maher’s final visits to the pub, fellow bartender and family relative, Shane Buggy said he had been “a true, traditional Irish publican” right to the end.Encountering a group he had not seen for 15 years, the elderly landlord “walked over to the bar, got a fistful of ale and just dropped it down and said, ‘Welcome back, lads.’ He was always like that. His generosity knew no bounds.”His passing shocked family and friends, said Buggy, remembering his last meeting with him a week ago, where his boss left him parting advice.“Ah you’re doing a great job down there, lads, keep it going,” Mr Maher had said. “Keep those doors open and keep the fire lit and you’ll have a crowd there this afternoon.”In its own message on Facebook, McSorley’s said: “When he started working at the bar, McSorley’s was still a men-only establishment with dozens of flophouses within blocks from 15 East 7th Street. When they had to let women in by court order on August 11th, 1970, the bar’s future was uncertain.“And when Matty purchased the place in 1977, the city was near bankrupt and the neighbourhood’s future uncertain. Landlords were just walking away from their buildings, heroin was rampant, cars had to wait in lines that extended for blocks just to get gas, crime, and grime everywhere.“But Matty left poverty back in Ireland and he was determined to leave it behind for good. He saw an opportunity and believed in the American Dream. And he loved history and all things Irish and knew McSorley’s and the city could survive when so many others told him he was absolutely nuts.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4141649.1579161116!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"election 2020 varadkar in spot of bother as campaign enters second day","story":"\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHarry McGee, Political Correspondent readies himself for another day on The  Election 2020 live blog"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4141149.1579126997!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"miriam lord leo is all over the gaffe as he launches campaign","story":"And they are off...  as the election for the 33rd Dáil begins,  Political Editor Pat Leahy predicts what the big issues will be. Video: Bryan O\u0027BrienReutersFianna FáilFine Gael\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Leo Varadkar, Tánaiste Simon Coveney,  Paschal Donohoe and Heather Humphreys at the headquarters of Combilift Ireland on Wednesday. Photograph: Paul FaithAFPGetty ImagesAt Fine Gael’s campaign launch in Monaghan, the Taoiseach joined fellow Brexit superstars Simon Coveney and Helen McEntee on the platform and modestly invited the world to luxuriate in the light of their combined presence. With a light garnish of Paschal the Paragon to gild the experience even more, it was quite the show. The event was held in a forklift factory – high-vis heaven for electioneering politicians. Local TD Heather Humphreys was also on hand to show the anxious Taoiseach how to sit into the cab of a Combilift without falling out or, worse still, looking like a culchie. The Presentables are an elite squad of Ministers the boss feels he can take anywhere in the course of the campaign to make Fine Gael look good. They are also unlikely to make a show of him or say the wrong thing – which is more than can be said for the Taoiseach, who made an ill-judged remark to journalists about a serious accident involving a homeless man in Dublin. It came across as political, like he was trying to tie Dublin’s Fianna Fáil lord mayor to the incident. To make matters worse, a photograph of the scene of the incident showed a poster for beleaguered Minister for Housing Eoghan Murphy on a nearby lamppost.The comments shifted focus from the message in Monaghan and knocked the carefully upbeat optics out of kilter. This is what happens during campaigns. “We do the best we can to manage the launch, but once it slips into open water anything can happen, no matter how well we prepare,” commented a Fine Gael handler before the gaffe, as he watched a relaxed Taoiseach and his shiny Presentables make their way down for their short press conference. It didn’t take long before his point was proved.Back to Leo’s A-team, although in fact they are really his B-team (much-lauded and well-connected fellow Brexit specialists). They represent the party’s not-so-secret weapon. Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe is an honorary member because he ticks all the cuteness boxes, from dimples through to sugar-coated street smarts.Heather, a safe pair of hands, was co-opted for the day. One after the other, they took to the microphone in the very impressive global headquarters of Combilift and enthusiastically extolled each others’ virtues. “Helen, Leo and I have criss-crossed Europe for the last two years,” quivered Coveney. Pause for thoughtBut it is only “half-time” in the Brexit long game. “Half-time” is the sporting metaphor with which Fine Gael is going to beat the electorate senseless over the coming weeks. And Brexit, they insist, is most definitely a game of two halves. So who should Ireland choose to play on? The Taoiseach turned at the lectern and his gaze fell on the great Presentables. “This team,” he said solemnly. He looked along the platform, but he didn’t look back. Remember the slogan? “A future to look forward to, hi”, as the Monaghan version might go. Or #LookForward, as plastered all over the backdrop. Expect ripping yarns of continental derring-do until polling day and, if the launch is anything to go by, shameless EU name-dropping of your Junckers, Barniers, Tusks and Von der Leyens, with whom they are very well got. Meanwhile, Leo reminded everyone he’s getting along very well with the UK prime minister, which is very important in the long run. Helen McEntee got in on the act, mentioning “of course, our very own commissioner, Phil Hogan”. Leo, Simon and Helen “are togged out and ready to go”, gurgled Heather, unlike the other crowd’s “junior B-team”.Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil are in a fight to the death, so the Presentables and their leader wasted no chance to take a cut at their main rivals. There was a spirited outbreak of Billy-bashing, with swipes at Fianna Fáil’s “only MEP” and his comments about the EU-UK withdrawal agreement. “Of course, thankfully, Fianna Fáil doesn’t have that much influence in Europe, and as a result the withdrawal agreement will pass through the European Parliament before the end of the month,” dripped Leo, scathingly.Imagine if Micheál Martin, Seán Haughey and Lisa Chambers had been handling the negotiations, he asked. “Would they have done a better job? I don’t think so.” Mission statementHeather Humphreys was surrounded by fancy forklifts and she couldn’t have been happier. In between spouting the obligatory sporting metaphors, she spoke of attending international trade missions with the company. “Of course, one of the highlights was sitting on a Combilift in Park Avenue as the whole town of New York looked on,” she cooed, misty-eyed, as we wrestled with the image of her perched atop a piece of industrial machinery and rolling through the streets of Manhattan. At the first opportunity she climbed into a Combilift cab. “Oh, Heather is a hoor for the hydraulics,” chuckled a local. “She’s the only one who knows how to drive the thing,” said a handler. “How will we get her down from it?” fretted another. No bother. And before long, Leo was climbing up into the cab of “a low material handler that goes in all four directions”, which sounded like a job description for a party press officer.“It’s quite spacious!” he marvelled, hitting the wheel like a five-year-old at the Ploughing with his daddy. Don’t tell Eoghan Murphy, we thought, or he’ll have it let out as a boutique apartment in no time.On so to Virginia in Cavan for the Taoiseach’s first walkabout among the ordinary people. He was there to open the constituency office of candidate TP O’Reilly – “TP for TD”. He made a speech on the steps of the building, promising the town a new bypass, something Fianna Fáil wouldn’t do. He is trying hard to improve his canvassing technique, and has definitely improved. But he will never be a natural flesh presser. He is trying very hard though. He even ate half a rich tea biscuit when a plate of them was offered. There was a scrum inside the office, which had big scented candles burning for the occasion. The crowd was very male and not exactly in the first flush of youth (apart from a large contingent of excited schoolkids). Pay outFine Gael is trying hard to win a second seat in the constituency. As the Taoiseach met a group of women who wanted to highlight the pay and conditions of childcare workers, a local party worker pleaded with the candidate to “push in there! Push in there! Get in there onto his shoulder!”In the local pharmacy, the Taoiseach met the owner, Brian O’Donoghue, but then asked: “Can I meet the staff?” Perhaps it was noticed that he didn’t talk to any workers at Combilift during his tour – unlike his predecessors who would have been shaking the arms off them.Loyola Arnold in T Arnold and Sons hardware and shooting supplies was amused by all the activity. Normally the area only gets media attention when ATMs are robbed, she remarked with a smile. Over in Brady’s drapers, Leo ran in to say hello to the lady behind the counter. What did she think of the visit? “I couldn’t care less.”Then it was into Micheál McEneaney’s butchers. He didn’t stay long. “Craft butcher!” boomed TP O’Reilly, as Leo looked a bit lost among the trays of red meat. There was an awkward silence as he looked at the sirloin steaks and gigot chops. “Oh, chicken goujons,” muttered the Taoiseach at the freezer cabinet as he left. “He’ll not be doing me much good, not eating the meat,” shrugged Micheál.Finally, the Taoiseach bade Cavan farewell at the steps of the constituency office. He waved and went to his car. It was a bit quiet. Suddenly, TP’s handler took command. “Big clap there lads. Big clap!” Day one done. One fiasco down. And despite all that effort, nobody wanted to talk to him about Brexit.

Photograph: Sergey PonomarevThe New York TimesThe US military resumed joint operations with Iraq on Wednesday, military officials said, ending a 10-day pause that began after a US air strike killed a top Iranian military commander in Baghdad. The decision to restart military operations came less than two weeks after Iraq’s parliament voted to expel all US forces from the country.The government accused the United States of violating Iraqi sovereignty by carrying out air strikes in Iraq, including one January 3rd that killed Iranian commander Qassem Suleimani, a leader of Iraqi militia forces and eight other people.Two US military officials, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to speak about the missions to reporters, confirmed that the joint operations had restarted. They said the military wanted to resume operations against the Islamic State as soon as possible to blunt any momentum the group might have and to stifle any propaganda victory it might claim because the United States had suspended the operation.It was unclear on Wednesday whether anyone in the Iraqi government approved the resumption of joint missions – it was the Americans who stopped them, not the Iraqis – and Iraqi officials could not be reached for comment. Iraq’s acting prime minister, Adil Abdul-Mahdi, who has said that his government would comply with parliament’s order to expel American forces, seemed to soften his position Wednesday.In a speech to his cabinet, he suggested that parliament’s decision might not be the final word, saying “If we reach the decision to get the forces out of Iraq, then this would be the decision of the Iraqi government.”‘Appropriate timeline’He also noted that if the government expelled the Americans, it would follow “an appropriate timeline”, suggesting that any departure might not be immediate. He also reminded the ministers that “Isis has begun to reorganise and plan invasions and attacks”.Mr Abdul-Mahdi had asked secretary of state Mike Pompeo over the weekend to send delegates to Iraq to work out the details of a troop withdrawal, according to a statement released by his office. Mr Pompeo refused, saying the US mission in Iraq was to train Iraqi forces to fight Islamic State, and “we’re going to continue that mission”.The state department said that the United States would only be willing to discuss “appropriate force posture in the Middle East”. Despite the Iraqi government’s moves toward expelling the Americans, some Iraqi security officials have opposed the idea, saying they were needed to help fight the remnants of Islamic State and prevent its resurgence, as well as to support coalition troops from other countries.If the Americans and most other coalition militaries left, the Iraqis could continue to fight the extremists on their own but would likely be hampered by a lack of drone-based intelligence and air cover, according to senior coalition military officials.Islamic State, which a few years ago controlled a large part of Iraq, no longer controls territory there but remains active in some pockets and claims a few Iraqi lives almost every week.

As for the question of the actual succession, it is as murky as ever.One possibility is that Mr Putin may be trying to carve out an unelected role as a kind of supreme leader above or to the side of the presidency, comparable with the role of Ayatollah Khamenei in Iran or Xi Jinping in China.Some had thought Mr Putin would trial potential future presidents in the role of Prime Minister.In the last two years of his presidency Boris Yeltsin got through no fewer than four prime ministers before he settled on Mr Putin in what became known as “operation successor.”But Mikhail Mishustin, the former tax service chief Mr Putin has nominated as acting prime minister, is an until now obscure civil servant.   Back in 1999, so was Mr Putin, so Mr Mishustin should not be ruled out.  Vladimir Putin and Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev But bookies\u0027 favourites Sergei Sobyanin, the competent but not especially charismatic Mayor of Moscow, and Sergei Shoigu, the popular defence minister who has overseen successful wars in Ukraine and Syria, remain very much in the running for the Kremlin.Even Alexei Kudrin, a former finance minister who has been considered a prime minister in waiting ever since he quit the cabinet after a public row with then-president Mr Medvedev in 2011, might yet make a come back.  “This is an exercise in keeping options open,” said Dr Sam Greene, the head of the Russia Institute at King’s College London. “It doesn\u0027t matter who is president because maybe the presidency won\u0027t matter.Robert Buckland defends cameras in court, saying we will not end up with \u0026#39OJ Simpson-style scenario\u0026#39Labour leadership latest: Corbyn allies urge Northern working class voters to join party in apparent bid to stop Sir Keir Starmer Sandi Toksvig quits Bake Off in latest blow to the show once adored by the nationChinese criminal convicted of murdering reclusive author  following secret trial loses appeal at European CourtChinese New Year 2020: Rats, luck and why you should avoid medicine, laundry and crying childrenKnife offences hit ten-year high with 60 recorded every day in the past yearIran says enriching more uranium than before 2015 nuclear accord as it rejects \u0026#39Trump deal\u0026#39\u0026#39Heartbreaking\u0026#39 moment family left 80-year-old uncle in the path of Philippines volcano threatWhat does Boris Johnson\u0026#39s Brexit deal mean for Northern Ireland and trade with the EU?South Korean \u0026#39Bad Fathers\u0026#39 site can out parents who skip child support, court rulesBrexit is a \u0026#39wake-up call\u0026#39 for the EU, says Angela MerkelPrince Harry makes first public appearance since he and Meghan Markle split from Royal Family - watch liveRain in Australian dampens bushfires but long-term relief unlikely until March, forecasters warnThe Briefing: Sign up for two-minute audio news updates on WhatsApp, Apple, Spotify and Alexa twice a dayComment: Are cracks already beginning to appear in Harry and Meghan\u0026#39s North American dream?20 years of Putin: How Russia\u0026#39s leader could hold on to powerThursday morning news briefing: Are there cracks in royal dream? Comment: The English churchyard is all the greater forDuke of Edinburgh Award says teenagers should try veganism and go on a digital detoxWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"russian government resigns putin carves new power base","story":"The entire Russian government abruptly resigned on Wednesday after President Vladimir Putin proposed constitutional changes in the clearest to date indication that he intends to stay in power beyond 2024 in a different role.The resignation of the government of the unpopular Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev shocked observers who were gearing up for a slow public campaign to implement the sweeping amendments that Mr Putin proposed just hours earlier.In a surprise development, Mr Putin said he wanted Mikhail Mishustin, head of the tax service, to be the next prime minister. Mr Mishustin, whose candidacy will be examined by parliament on Thursday, has a relatively low profile and had not been spoken of as a possible candidate.Mr Mishustin, 53, has played ice hockey with Putin and will inevitably be viewed as a possible presidential successor, as will members of the new government, many of whom are expected to be new.A screen shows Mr Putin\u0026#39s address to the Federal Assembly in MoscowMr Putin has been at the helm since 2000,and he is constitutionally barred from seeking re-election in 2024.The Russian leader is widely believed to be planning to hold on to power, and speculation has been rife that he was looking to amend the Russian constitution to stay in another capacity, possibly as a prime minister or as chairman of parliament or of the State Council, an important advisory body.Capping his annual state of the nation address to lawmakers, governors, top officials and judges, Mr Putin on Wednesday voiced proposals to amend the Constitution that would cut the president’s power in favour of parliament.He did not say if that affected his personal plans but insisted that those changes would serve all Russians. Several hours later, Russian state TV televised a meeting of the Russian government, attended by Mr Putin, when Prime Minister Medvedev said that the entire cabinet was stepping down.Twenty years of Putin“The resignation of the government is necessary to let the president of our country to make all the necessary decisions” to see through the proposed amendments, Mr Medvedev, who has served as prime minister for eight years, said.The decision apparently came as a surprise even for some cabinet ministers.Most of them looked sombre if not shocked as they listened to Mr Medvedev’s announcement compared to the light mood that many were in when they talked to reporters after Mr Putin’s address.The respected website The Bell later quoted two unnamed ministers saying that no one in the cabinet knew about the impending resignation.“It’s all very unclear and unexpected,” Moscow-based political analyst Masha Lipman told The .“It’s definitely part of the (succession) plan but we don’t know right now what this plan is.”Russian President Vladimir Putin meets with Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev in Moscow on WednesdayTatyana Stanovaya, nonresident scholar at the Moscow Carnegie Centre and head of the R.Politik political analysis firm, wrote on Wednesday that the resignation of the government likely aims for Mr Putin to groom a new successor, whoever that might be: “It looks very much like Putin is preparing to leave the presidency… and is currently trying to create a safety mechanism for his successor in case of conflict.”Mr Medvedev and his government have been tainted by allegations of large-scale corruption, and his unpopularity was reportedly dragging down Mr Putin’s approval ratings.Mr Medvedev has been Mr Putin’s loyal ally since he willingly assumed Russian presidency in 2008 and then put aside his own political ambitions and supported Mr Putin’s decision to run again in 2012.On Wednesday, President Putin offered Mr Medvedev to work as his deputy at Russia’s Security Council, an important advisory body.It was not unclear, however, if Mr Putin had any other senior positions for the outgoing prime minister in mind.Earlier on Wednesday, Mr Putin suggested vesting the State Duma, lower chamber of Russian parliament, with powers to nominate and endorse the country’s prime minister and the cabinet after that.The president, according to Mr Putin, will not be able to veto those nominations.  Succession to Mr Putin has been “a serious problem for the regime that has one uncontested leader who has to step down in 2024 because his term expires, and it’s been obvious for some time now that solving the problem of 2024 would reshuffling the system of power,” according to Ms Lipman, the analyst.Mr Putin announced changes to the constitution in his annual state of the nation address on WednesdayThe announcement of the constitutional amendments came as the clearest indication yet of where Mr Putin sees himself after 2024 but it did not offer clarity about a specific position that he is supposed to take next.“We can say now with more certainly that Putin does intend to step down as president in 2024,” Ms Lipman said, adding that the president chose not to reveal his future role at this point.Alexei Kudrin, Mr Putin’s long-time ally and head of Russia’s Audit Chamber, in comments on Russian state TV said on Wednesday that it was “too early to say” if the president would move to a new senior post after 2024. Mr Putin’s proposals left enough room for speculation which top job he would be aiming for.Along with advocating more powers for the lower chamber of power, he also offered to leave it up to the upper chamber to name top law enforcement officials, and he spoke for elevating the role of the Constitutional Court to review all legislation before it goes to the president for final approval.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told the state-owned news agency Tass on Wednesday that the amendments will not be coming up at a referendum but some kind of vote that he would not immediately specify.Robert Buckland defends cameras in court, saying we will not end up with \u0026#39OJ Simpson-style scenario\u0026#39Labour leadership latest: Corbyn allies urge Northern working class voters to join party in apparent bid to stop Sir Keir Starmer Sandi Toksvig quits Bake Off in latest blow to the show once adored by the nationChinese criminal convicted of murdering reclusive author  following secret trial loses appeal at European CourtChinese New Year 2020: Rats, luck and why you should avoid medicine, laundry and crying childrenKnife offences hit ten-year high with 60 recorded every day in the past yearIran says enriching more uranium than before 2015 nuclear accord as it rejects \u0026#39Trump deal\u0026#39\u0026#39Heartbreaking\u0026#39 moment family left 80-year-old uncle in the path of Philippines volcano threatWhat does Boris Johnson\u0026#39s Brexit deal mean for Northern Ireland and trade with the EU?South Korean \u0026#39Bad Fathers\u0026#39 site can out parents who skip child support, court rulesBrexit is a \u0026#39wake-up call\u0026#39 for the EU, says Angela MerkelPrince Harry makes first public appearance since he and Meghan Markle split from Royal Family - watch liveRain in Australian dampens bushfires but long-term relief unlikely until March, forecasters warnThe Briefing: Sign up for two-minute audio news updates on WhatsApp, Apple, Spotify and Alexa twice a dayComment: Are cracks already beginning to appear in Harry and Meghan\u0026#39s North American dream?20 years of Putin: How Russia\u0026#39s leader could hold on to powerThursday morning news briefing: Are there cracks in royal dream? Comment: The English churchyard is all the greater forDuke of Edinburgh Award says teenagers should try veganism and go on a digital detoxWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/12/31/TELEMMGLPICT000220110844_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqcM9aBJczjGu2JtrWg8AaNebpMG9uWgcnc3MvHmUFhjA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"20 years putin russias leader could hold power","story":"Russian president Vladimir Putin should - in theory - retire in 2024This was first published in December 2019 and is republished in light of the Russian government resigning.The constitution of the Russian Federation is clear: no president may remain in office for more than two consecutive terms. So come 2024 Vladimir Putin should - in theory - retire. But few believe that the man who has ruled Russia for 20 years will find it easy to let go of the reins of power, even if he wants to. There are three basic scenarios that are chewed over in the salons, bars, and think tanks of Moscow. Which one could be in favour in the black box that is the Kremlin is anyone’s guess - but that’s half the fun of Kremlinology.  The first is known in as “Castling”, and it has the benefit of precedent. In 2008, when Mr Putin was coming to the end of his (first) second term, the world watched with bated breath to see whether he would gracefully retire or give into the despotic temptation to re-write the constitution to his own benefit. Instead, he confounded everybody by stepping down in favour of Dmitry Medvedev, a loyal place-man who promptly appointed Mr Putin as prime minister - thus respecting the constitution while remaining very much in control of Russia. And sure enough, when Mr Medvedev’s first term ended in 2012, he declined to run for a second term and instead endorsed Mr Putin as his successor - who promptly returned to the Kremlin. 20 years of Putin: Inside the brutal Chechen war that dealt a death blow to Russian democracy20 years of Putin: How Russia\u0027s younger generation have lost the capacity to imagine another futureThe first Castling was a bit of constitutional chicanery that took almost everyone by surprise and was therefore considered deviously brilliant. But will he risk stepping away from the Kremlin again? Last time nearly ended in disaster, with Mr Medvedev reportedly gathering supporters to make his own grab for a second term, and massive protests on the streets of Moscow when the public realised they had been fooled. Vladimir Putin watches the men\u0026#39s 4x10 K cross-country relay with Dmitry Medvedev at the 2014 Winter Olympics in 2014That’s why some think that this time, the Kremlin will take the second option and simply re-write the constitution. Approval shouldn’t be a problem: the Kremlin could easily muster the two thirds of the lower house, three quarters of the upper house, and approval of two thirds of Russia’s 83 federal regions needed to pass such amendments.And the idea has already been gently introduced to public discourse over the past year. In summer, Vychaslav Volodin, the speaker of the State Duma, Russia’s lower house, suggested a tweak that would allow parliament more say in choosing ministers.  Dmitry Peskov, Mr Putin’s spokesman, said it was a matter for discussion. The vague nature of debate at the moment leaves the door open to changes that could allow Mr Putin to remain as president, or shift more powers to the prime minister in the event of another “castling.”Then again, if the current president of the Russian Federation can stay more than two terms, maybe what you need isn’t a new constitution, but a new country. This brings us to scenario number three - easily the most dramatic, and for that reason the most beloved of op-ed writers, think-tankers, and, well, anyone who loves a good rumour really.Back in 1996, Russia and neighbouring Belarus signed a “union state” agreement that theoretically commits both to an ever-closer and more perfect union. At the moment it mostly amounts to free movement on the Russia-Belarus border and right of abode for one another’s citizens. But over the past year there have been calls from Moscow to get the process of integration on the move again. That, say some, means the Kremlin wants to force a merger, uniting both countries into a new sovereign state would require an entirely new constitution and a new presidency. Naturally, this “new” country would need an experienced leader to midwife its birth and guide its first years or decades on the international stage. Someone with a strong record in running former Soviet states with nine time zones - someone like, er, Vladimir Putin. There are one or two stumbling blocks to this Anschluss, however. Alexander Lukashenko, the dictator of Belarus, is not a fan. Nor, opinion polls suggest, are the Belarusian public. It would also alarm just about all of Russia’s neighbours, with good reason. It would give Russia a second border with Poland and Nato, outflank Ukraine from the north, and scare the bejesus out of other former Soviet republics who already half-suspect Mr Putin harbours ambitions to harness them back into a Soviet Union 2.0. These are not the only options on the table. Perhaps the biggest surprise Mr Putin could pull would be to retire, Diocletian like, to fish and ride horses in some Siberian idyll. But whatever choice Mr Putin makes in the next four years, it will leave Russia and the world fundamentally changed. Robert Buckland defends cameras in court, saying we will not end up with \u0026#39OJ Simpson-style scenario\u0026#39Labour leadership latest: Corbyn allies urge Northern working class voters to join party in apparent bid to stop Sir Keir Starmer Sandi Toksvig quits Bake Off in latest blow to the show once adored by the nationChinese criminal convicted of murdering reclusive author  following secret trial loses appeal at European CourtChinese New Year 2020: Rats, luck and why you should avoid medicine, laundry and crying childrenKnife offences hit ten-year high with 60 recorded every day in the past yearIran says enriching more uranium than before 2015 nuclear accord as it rejects \u0026#39Trump deal\u0026#39\u0026#39Heartbreaking\u0026#39 moment family left 80-year-old uncle in the path of Philippines volcano threatWhat does Boris Johnson\u0026#39s Brexit deal mean for Northern Ireland and trade with the EU?South Korean \u0026#39Bad Fathers\u0026#39 site can out parents who skip child support, court rulesBrexit is a \u0026#39wake-up call\u0026#39 for the EU, says Angela MerkelPrince Harry makes first public appearance since he and Meghan Markle split from Royal Family - watch liveRain in Australian dampens bushfires but long-term relief unlikely until March, forecasters warnThe Briefing: Sign up for two-minute audio news updates on WhatsApp, Apple, Spotify and Alexa twice a dayComment: Are cracks already beginning to appear in Harry and Meghan\u0026#39s North American dream?Thursday morning news briefing: Are there cracks in royal dream? Comment: The English churchyard is all the greater forComment: It is time to call out the intolerant woke\u0026#39s racist double standardsDuke of Edinburgh Award says teenagers should try veganism and go on a digital detoxWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/12/10/TELEMMGLPICT000218738818_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqeK8ehqBZJSTiVTgumtathbH8AD1LYTdJsoz8pklmEgw.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"english churchyard greater forits gatekeepers","story":"Crazy epitaphs are out of place in what is a communal spaceIt’s rough luck on John Chadfield, a widower from Alton, who not only lost his wife but was not allowed to have the epitaph he wanted on her gravestone. Stephen Eyre QC, Chancellor of the Diocese of Lichfield, barred him putting a brass plaque with the following words on the rough-hewn, wedge-shaped stone in the churchyard:“My much loved wife … and mother of our two boys, died at home aged seventy-one. She met her death with courage and is now at peace. So we’ll go no more a’roving. For the sword outwears its sheath. And the soul wears out the breast, And the heart must pause to breathe. And love itself have rest. RIP.’”For Mr Eyre, the words (an abbreviation of a lovely poem by Byron) were not in keeping with the purpose of a churchyard – being from “a secular poem which conveys no suggestion of Christian hope”. He didn’t care for “our” boys and “my” wife as being overtly personal. He pointed out that gravestones weren’t only read by the family but by everyone who passes through the graveyard.While it must have been disappointing for the widower, anyone who cares about these things will cheer Mr Eyre. We may pay – quite a lot – for the plots in which our relations’ mortal remains go, but those lucky enough to get one in a churchyard need to remember that it’s not, therefore, private property. You’re in a public, communal space – the most egalitarian communal space there is. That imposes constraints on your epitaphs, and your monuments.Despite – or because of – that, there is a formidable tradition of epitaph writing it’s a literary form in itself, which especially exercised people in the eighteenth and nineteenth century, who were perfectly aware that the epitaph would long survive them and the people they commemorated. There were many published collections of them: witty, unintentionally funny, poignant.The rise of the do-it-yourself funeral: how to cut the cost of dyingNot all church epitaphsare about Christian hope but lots are. Many were done to a simple formula: “Sacred to the memory of X, widow of Y, who died in 1822” or whenever, but for others it was an unsurpassed way of reminding onlookers about their own mortality, about the vanity of earthly pomp and the abiding character of virtue, which got you to heaven. It’s fair to say that these preoccupations aren’t much in evidence in contemporary monuments.In epitaphs about spouses, most commemorate their virtues a few don’t. One, from Cumberland, records a Mary Bond, who was “Temperate, Chaste and Charitable, But She was Proud, Peevish and Passionate...” and so it goes on. It was written by her brother-in-law to “the surviving wives of the parish” as a warning.But all epitaphs bring us together, because they record our common, inescapable fate. As Joseph Addison wrote on Epitaphs, “When I look upon the tombs of the great, every emotion of envy died in me… when I meet with the grief of parents, upon a tombstone, my heart melts with compassion… when I read the several dates of tombs, of some that died yesterday, and some 600 years ago, I consider that great day, when we shall all of us be contemporaries, and make our appearance together.”The widower from Alton can take comfort that the best epitaph is already in his wife’s inscription: RIP – Requiescat in Pace – May She Rest in Peace.

How did things get so bad in my kitchen?’ asks food writer Julia Platt LeonardI avoid cleaning my refrigerator like other people put off doing their taxes. I wait until it’s a sea of plastic containers, cling-film-wrapped onion halves, teetering jars – until I can’t find the mayonnaise or remember where the parmesan cheese is. Only then, when I can’t fit another thing inside, do I take it all out.\u0026nbspI throw out the piece of salmon skin I was going to give to the dogs. I toss out something spore-covered (carrots? meatballs?) and another item I think used to be a solid but is now liquid. Judging by the amount of mould, you’d think I was starting up a penicillin laboratory.And each time I chuck out an uneaten leftover or a floppy cucumber I feel ashamed – ashamed at the waste. As a food writer, I know better.\u0026nbspSharing the full story, not just the headlinesAccording to the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations, about one third of the food produced in the world – a whopping 1.3 billion tonnes – is wasted or lost. In richer countries we waste as much food as sub-Saharan Africa produces. I’ve interviewed farmers, written about food policy and yet I’m part of the problem.I see myself standing before a food waste deity (picture Greta Thunberg with a white beard) and am forced to look at the piles of food I’ve wasted. It’s not a pretty picture. How did things get so bad in my kitchen?Why I’ve decided to start cycling to workI went to cooking school and worked in professional kitchens so FIFO – “first-in, first-out” – was my mantra. Food came in and we prepared and served it to ensure that waste was kept to a minimum. We labelled containers and made prep lists so nothing was missed. The walk-in fridge was kept clean, for hygiene reasons of course, but also so we knew what we had and ordered accordingly. My fridge? A disaster zone.I wasn’t raised to waste. My maternal grandparents came from western Kentucky, got married during the depression, and would no sooner have wasted a morsel of food than they would have walked down the street naked. When things were really tight, my grandmother reused coffee grounds and gave cucina povera a decidedly southern twist. My mother was the same, serving a meal one night, leftovers the next, and if necessary ‘must-go’ servings on the third.Food that’s not eaten either goes down the drain, is incinerated or ends up on a landfill where greenhouse gases are generated. That’s waste. But it’s also a waste because land, water, labour and energy were spent to create the food I binned. It’s also food that could have fed other people.My food waste, whether it’s the mystery container wedged in the back of the fridge or the past-sell-by date beans on my cupboard shelves, must stop. That’s why I’ve committed to reducing my food waste in 2020.Why I\u0027m making my home more eco-friendlyThat means getting a handle on what comes in my kitchen and what goes back out. It also means taking a critical look at the food choices I’m making. If I want my kitchen to be more sustainable then it’s time to ask some tough questions. Where do the foods I eat come from? What impact do they make on the earth? Can I justify eating avocados or pouring almond milk on my cereal? And the elephant – scratch that, cow – in the room, can I be an ethical omnivore?I’m going to learn more about food labelling to find out what it tells us, and what it doesn’t. I’ll figure out how to cut down on plastic in my kitchen and waste in my cooking. I’ll embrace my leftovers and think before I buy.I’ll make my kitchen and my cooking more sustainable in 2020, one meal at a time.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The headline rate of inflation fell to 1.3 per cent in December, so it might look like that.\u0026nbspThat is,\u0026nbspuntil you take into account that the already high chances of an interest rate cut just increased.

The closely watched London market has, for example, been torpid of late and that hasn’t changed.

It held numerous government construction and maintenance contracts, for many of which the future is still uncertain“This highlights the critical importance of the government addressing the challenge around housing supply particularly with the gradual phasing out of the Help to Buy incentive,” he said.The RICS survey, which is based on opinions of surveyors up and down the country, found that 17 per cent more respondents saw a rise rather than a fall in enquiries from new buyers in December, up from minus 5 per cent in the previous month.Most regions saw interest from new buyers increase with respondents in Wales and the North East reporting solid growth while enquiries rose in London and the South East after negative results in November.The housing get-rich-quick scheme is dead. And not a moment too soonThe number of transactions also increased with 9 per cent more respondents seeing a rise than a fall. While a net balance of 9 per cent also reported an increase in new instructions offering some relief from the price pressure, this was concentrated in London and the South while the rest of the country was flat.A net balance of 61 per cent said they expected prices to increase over the coming 12 months, almost double the 33 per cent balance a month earlier.The upbeat tone will add to the dilemma that the Bank of England faces at the end of the month when it decides on interest rates.Earlier this week Halifax said house prices rose sharply in December, increasing by 1.7 per cent from the previous month to push the annual increase to 4 per cent. Official figures on Wednesday showed prices rose by 2.2 per cent in the year to November up from 1.3 per cent in October 2019.However this has been offset by a slew of downbeat data including a drop in the annual inflation rate in December to 1.3 per cent from 1.5 per cent taking it further below the bank’s 2 per cent target, while the economy contracted by 0.3 per cent in November to leave annual growth at zero.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The remaining $5 trillion of its funds are passive, meaning it\u0026nbspsimply allocates clients’\u0026nbspmoney\u0026nbspto a basket of stocks and bonds weighted in such a way as to track indexes such as the FTSE 100, for example.Investment giant threatens to pull funds from gunmakersBecause oil and gas companies account for a significant slice of major stock markets, BlackRock will remain heavily invested in them unless it makes further policy changes.Jeanne Martin, campaign manager at ShareAction said: “Larry Fink talks a lot about companies’ purpose, but there are questions left unanswered about what BlackRock’s own purpose is, and how its stewardship delivers the social, environmental, and financial performance that its clients are looking for.“While we welcome its commitment to improve transparency of its stewardship activities, for far too long the asset manager has kept everyone in the dark about the companies it was meeting with, the topics discussed, and most importantly the outcome of those engagements.\u0026nbsp“But we might not like what we see when we open the door on these activities: BlackRock’s current voting disclosures on climate issues give little comfort that it will vote in a manner fitting of the climate crisis.”Ms Martin added: “BlackRock’s coal estment decision is yet another significant blow to the already dying market.”The ShareAction\u0026nbspcharity is calling on the fund manager to go further by using its voting rights to pressure banks to stop financing coal.BlackRock’s announcement comes a day after almost all of Britain’s top universities committed to selling their shares in fossil fuel companies after pressure from eco-conscious students who have occupied buildings and carried out hunger strikes.\u0026nbspCharlie Kronick, climate finance campaigner for Greenpeace UK, said:\u0026nbsp“BlackRock’s announcement this morning is an acknowledgement of the culpability of the financial sector for the climate emergency, their responsibility to fix it, and the impossibility of carrying on business as usual now that the world is awake to the crisis we have created.\u0026nbsp“Barclays Bank and other UK institutions financing fossil fuel expansion need to step up and do the same, and do it quickly, if they want to avoid becoming the target of unprecedented pressure from activists and investors to end their ongoing funding of the climate emergency.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Borrowing excluding mortgages was 15 per cent of total income last year, compared to 19 per cent in 2008.But the average hides varying experiences with debt for different income groups over the past 12 years.For instance, comparing the 2006-2008 period to 2016-2019, there was a 13 percentage point rise in the share of lower-income households (defined as the bottom fifth of earners) using a credit card. Among those in the middle there was a 4-point rise\u0026nbspand in the top fifth only a 2-point increase.There was also a 4 percentage point rise in the share of households in the bottom income quintile using overdrafts as compared to a 2 point rise among those in the middle and a 1 point fall among those at the top.\u0026nbspThe rise has coincided with an unprecedented period of stagnant wages, alongside dwindling savings, suggesting that low-income households have topped up their income with expensive debt.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailFewer than half of low-to-middle income families reported having any savings in 2016-17, representing a rise of 15 percentage points since the financial crisis and leaving them exposed to a period of hard times.Kathleen Henehan, policy analyst at the Resolution Foundation, said: “Access to new credit can be hugely beneficial for low-income families, but with many also reporting that they have no savings to fall back on, these high debt repayment pressures are a sign of stretched living standards.\u0026nbspBritain’s borrowing binge slowing but consumer debt still too high“The risk is that this leaves them far too exposed to future financial shocks, reinforcing the need for policymakers to focus on the living standards of those on low and middle incomes.”While lower-income households have taken out increasing amounts of expensive, unsecured credit, wealthier households have benefited disproportionately from record-low mortgage interest rates.\u0026nbspThose in the top household income quintile are more than three times as likely to access mortgages as those in the bottom fifth.Recent research from the Bank of England concluded that low interest rates were the primary driver\u0026nbspof rising house prices over the past four decades, not shortage of supply, as has been suggested.\u0026nbsp“Nearly all of the rise in average house prices relative to incomes can be seen as a result of a sustained, dramatic, and consistently unexpected, decline in real interest rates,” the researchers wrote.A jump in average house prices of 52 per cent from a low point in 2009 has generated trillions of pounds of property wealth, with older, wealthier households enjoying the lion’s share of gains.Estate agents\u0026nbspSavills\u0026nbspfound that the total value of the UK’s housing stock hit a record £7.4tn last year having jumped £2.7tn in the past decade alone. An “unprecedented” 46 per cent of homeowner wealth is now in the hands of the over 65s, Savills said.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Borrowing excluding mortgages was 15 per cent of total income last year, compared to 19 per cent in 2008.But the average hides varying experiences with debt for different income groups over the past 12 years.For instance, comparing the 2006-2008 period to 2016-2019, there was a 13 percentage point rise in the share of lower-income households (defined as the bottom fifth of earners) using a credit card. Among those in the middle there was a 4-point rise\u0026nbspand in the top fifth only a 2-point increase.There was also a 4 percentage point rise in the share of households in the bottom income quintile using overdrafts as compared to a 2 point rise among those in the middle and a 1 point fall among those at the top.\u0026nbspThe rise has coincided with an unprecedented period of stagnant wages, alongside dwindling savings, suggesting that low-income households have topped up their income with expensive debt.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

An “unprecedented” 46 per cent of homeowner wealth is now in the hands of the over 65s, Savills said.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

November\u0027s dismal weather will finally change, with drier and colder conditions coming for the start of December, forecasters have saidThe moment a swan flew over a flock of 60,000 starlings as dusk fell on Whixall Moss Nature Reserve in Shropshire Ms Fox, who has been a headteacher for 17 years, was left “devastated” by the autumn ruling — which she said prompted hundreds of parents to write to the chief inspector\u0026nbspto complain.“This school is the strongest it has ever been,” she told The Independent. “This has not done anything to help our school and actually now it is going into a period of turbulence because the head is leaving.”In the resignation letter to governors, Ms Fox wrote: “I am powerless to change things. I do put my heart and soul into all I do and this desire has now been completely extinguished by this Ofsted experience.”Ms Fox won a silver award at the Pearson Teaching Awards last year for turning Bramhall High School around and securing “outstanding” results. \u0026nbspSpeaking to The Independent about\u0026nbspOfsted, Ms Fox said: “For the first time in my life, I have struggled to come to work. I have dealt with mergers and redundancies as a head and I have got through everything. Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It is a lottery who comes in and what they decide,” she added.\u0026nbspFrom September last year, Ofsted moved its focus away from pupils’ exam results and grades and adopted a new, broader assessment of “quality of education” as part of changes to inspections.Leaders of academy chains have recently accused Ofsted of favouring middle-class children with its new inspection regime, which values a broad curriculum.\u0026nbspThey object to schools being marked down for giving pupils three years to study for the exams rather than two as they say starting GCSE preparation earlier can help pupils on free school meals.\u0026nbspGeoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: “We are concerned that the new inspection framework is placing too much emphasis on the operation of key stage 3 programmes in schools, and we are talking to Ofsted about these concerns.”Backlash from teachers as Tories pledge no-notice school inspectionsParents ‘making knee-jerk decision’ to home-school their childrenLabour vows to scrap and replace OfstedHe added: “The inspection system often has a demoralising effect on school leaders and their staff and it needs to be reformed. This is caused largely by the use of blunt descriptors such as ‘requires improvement’, which are unduly harsh and allow for no nuance.”Nick Brook, deputy general secretary of school leaders’ union NAHT, said: “Inspectors are being asked to do too much, in too short a time, and with too great a degree of subjectivity. All of which is leading to rushed and ill thought-out judgements\u0026nbsp— with sadly career defining consequences for headteachers.”“Education standards in this country have transformed in the last 25 years, with 86 per cent of schools now good or better.

Pre-orders begin soon!”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesInstead of receiving an excited response from fans, though, people are furious that he has delayed work on The Winds of Winter once again.“Happy to announce? At this point you’re trolling,” one frustrated fan wrote, with another adding: “Wow, an update no one was waiting for! You won’t get a cent from me until Winds of Winter is published.”Created with Sketch.Game of Thrones - every episode ranked Show all 73Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.There has to be a loser. ‘Eastwatch’ throws away one of the most important pieces of information in the whole show, Jon’s true parentage, as well as lots of good reunions. It’s the clearest example of how rushed the show has become in recent years, as its unpredictability gives way to conventional plot. 273 72. Season four, episode three: Breaker of ChainsJaime appears to rape Cersei next to Joffrey’s corpse. The scene is confused, unpleasant and different from the books in confusing and unhelpful ways. The Sand Snakes are just unbearably naff and this is one of their worst.At Craster’s Keep, much rape and murder of children. Unpleasant. The opposite of the rushed plot of the later seasons, this is basically a leisurely chat up the M1. 673 68. Season eight, episode four: The Last of the StarksGiven a chance to return to real intrigue after the Battle of Winterfell, Benioff and Weiss showed they had lost their grip, with an incoherent episode that betrayed several key characters for the sake of obvious plot grinding. A Starbucks cup left on a feasting table told us everything we needed to know about a series that has given up.773 67. Season two, episode eight: Prince of WinterfellThere is some good stuff with Arya and Jaqen H’ghar, but it’s mainly placeholder as they set up the Battle of Blackwater. Jon Snow and Ygritte’s goodbye at the climax of season three ought to have been much sadder. 973 65. Season five, episode two: The House of Black and WhiteLots of setting up. Jaime and Bronn plan to go to Dorne, Arya arrives in Braavos. 1073 64. Season seven, episode six: Beyond the WallThis ought to have been one of the great battles: ice zombies plus dragons plus Jon Snow’s expedition. It looked spectacular, but everyone worried about teleporting ravens and speed of sound dragons. Some absolutely horrible banter between Grey Worm and Missandei.Pyat Pree kills the 13 in Qarth. Tywin talks to Arya about legacy.Melisandre is a very, very old woman. Lots of Tyrion talking in King’s Landing but not much else. The Hound meets Ian McShane. That’s about it in an episode full of preparations.A classic season opener that flits from place to place. 1773 57. Season two, episode four: Garden of BonesLots of grimness. Rat and bucket torture at Harrenhal. Robb Stark meets Talisa. Joffrey is cruel to Ros and Daisy. 1873 56. Season five, episode one: The Wars to ComeMance Rayder refuses to bend the knee, is burned at the stake by Stannis before Jon shoots him with an arrow. A pretty good death actually. 1973 55. Season five, episode five: Kill the BoySeason five is perhaps the weakest, and this is one of the weakest episodes in it, despite some good Bolton action and the Stone Men’s fateful attack on Tyrion and Jorah Mormont as they sailed through Valyria. In the season two opener we meet Stannis at Dragonstone, and then Joffrey orders a tremendous infanticide. It was vaguely controversial at the time. Feels like a lifetime ago. ‘Power is power,’ Cersei tells Littlefinger, which was good.Jon Snow coming back to life really shouldn’t have felt flat. Yet it did. Understandable given that it had to build an entire medieval universe, but 12 major characters are introduced here. That’s too many major characters. 2373 51. Season six, epsidoe four: Book of the StrangerJon and Sansa reunite, which is cool, Daenerys burns some more enemies, which is hot, good High Sparrow monologue to Margaery. Theme of climbing. Thormund makes his way up the Wall Littlefinger gives his most famous monologue, as he explains to Varys that chaos is ‘a ladder’. 2573 49. Season five, episode two: Sons of the HarpyMid-season doldrums, particularly acute in five, as Jaime and Bronn arrive in Dorne.The same, basically, except for Tyrion meeting Daenerys. Everyone gives each other presents. Sluggish early-season number, although we meet Olenna and Margaery shows how skilful she will be at manipulating court. Until the later series, eight episodes are a bit hamstrung by setting up denouements to follow. This is true in season one, as the machinery creaks to set up the beheading they didn’t think could happen. 2973 45. Season three, episode seven: The Bear and the Maiden FairEven re-looking at what happened in this episode I still can’t really remember it, except for the fight with the bear. Oh yes, Mackenzie Crook! Forgot he was in this programme. 3073 44. Season two, episode five: The Ghost of HarrenhalTwo good moments: Renly is killed by the shadow, and Arya meets Jaqen H’ghar. 3173 43. Season eight, episode two: \u0027A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms\u0027Another slow scene setter for the epic Battle of Winterfell, full of night-before antics including the knighting of Brienne by Jamie, and the slightly disturbing sight of Arya and Gendry preparing to go at it hammer and tongs.The demise of top lad Roose Bolton, as well as Balon Greyjoy, both sent to their ends by their families. Melisandre finally works her anti-death magic on Jon Snow. 3373 41. Season four, episode five: First of His NameOne of the good things about season four was that it was the only moment where, even briefly, it looked as though a kind of temporary stability had been achieved. Tommen is king, Sansa has escaped King’s Landing, Jon Snow and co get revenge on the mutineers at Craster’s Keep. The White Walkers attacking the Night’s Watch at the Fist of the First Men is a good laugh, but other than that there is a lot to get through, after the events of Blackwater in the previous episode, and the season two finale anticipates some of the rushed feeling that will occur later on. 3573 39. Season one, episode seven: You Win or You DieOur first real glimpse of what Cersei will become, as she outmanoeuvres Ned Stark after Robert Baratheon’s death in a hunting accident. A superb Arya moment, as she wipes out the rest of House Frey, but mainly this is set-up for a season that packs a lot in.3773 37. Season one, episode four: Cripples, Bastards and Broken ThingsNed working as policeman in Kings Landing to find out what happened to Jon Arryn. 3873 36. Season five, episode nine: Dance of DragonsOne of the most upsetting deaths in Game of Thrones, as Stannis Baratheon burns his friendly daughter Shireen alive to appease Melisandre. Theon jumping off the boat after Euron overruns the Greyjoy fleet. Nice reunion between Arya and Hot Pie. Tyrion talks Daenerys down from incinerating King’s Landing.A slower than expected opener for the final season, albeit with some touching reunions at Winterfell, especially Bran and Jamie seeing each other again.  4173 33. Season six, episode six: Blood of My BloodMidseasoner. Cersei sends Jaime to retake Riverrun, while Arya is finally trained as an assassin. Can’t really remember it, to be honest. 4273 32. Season one, episode five: The Wolf and the LionJaime and Ned have a brawl in the streets of King’s Landing in an episode that focuses on skulduggery rather than magic. If you ask me skulduggery always trumps magic. 4373 31. Season three, episode three: Walk of PunishmentThe first moment where a character’s trajectory was really reversed. We’d disliked Jaime since the start, but when his hand was chopped off he began to win us back. The Blackfish schooling Edmure at shooting fire arrows was another highlight. The opening of the fourth series introduced the charismatic, enigmatic Viper of Dorne, one of the few good things other than wine to come out of Dorne. Also notable for an excellent scene with Arya and the Hound clearing out an Inn.Introduces Margaery Tyrell and Brienne of Tarth, two of the best characters, and also sees Theon decide to betray Robb Stark. What is family? Who can you trust? Built around Sansa and Tyrion’s unwelcome wedding, while in the north there is a display of how important Sam will be as he draws on reserves of bravery to dragonglass a white walker. Littlefinger dumping Lysa out of the Eyrie is probably the most dramatic moment here, one of his decisive power-stealing moments as he saves Sansa. Can you remember a time before Game of Thrones? Re-watch ‘Winter is Coming’, marvel at the baby Starks, think on how many characters have died, reflect on your own mortality. You are much, much older than when Game of Thrones began. Your life is running between your fingers. Another dramatic death which is hard to remember now, as the miserable Viserys was put out of his grump with molten gold. Well, that was that. The grand finale provoked much gnashing of teeth and hot air, not all of it from Drogon. In truth, things were tied up as best they could, given the way the the different pieces had been arranged, although some of the criticism was valid. The king-choosing and first council scenes were amazingly lame. A number of questions were skirted over. Still, what a spectacle. 5173 23. Season two, episode six: Old Gods and the NewTheon takes Winterfell. Theon, you utter bastard. I hope you are punished for this.A key Littlefinger episode, as he continues to manipulate Sansa, while Jon Snow executes Janos and, in King’s Landing, Cersei’s machinations are matched by Margaery’s. 5373 21. Season four, episode two: The Lion and the RoseJoffrey, scratching at his throat, going purple, dying. Top stuff. 5473 20. Season four, episode six: The Laws of Gods and MenAn excellent mid-season episode, built around Tyrion’s trial but with lots of other things to admire that hint at the underlying economies in the Game of Thrones universe. Drogon barbecues some livestock, while the Iron Bank of Braavos refuses to bail out Davos and Stannis. The full depravity of Ramsay Bolton is laid bare as he taunts Theon with a fake escape, while Commander Mormont is murdered at Craster’s Keep. But really it’s all about Daenerys, as she and her pets flame Astapor to the ground.5673 18. Season seven, episode seven: The Dragon and the WolfIt turns out Jon Snow is actually the true heir to the Seven Kingdoms, the remaining Stark children finally team up to kill Littlefinger, admittedly in overwrought style, and the White Walkers use their new lizard hairdryer to destroy the wall. There is far too much going on, especially the odd scene where Jon shows Cersei the wight, but nevertheless it sends you reaching for the popcorn and cheering along, which is more or less where we are at with the whole series by now. 5773 17. Season three, episode five: Kissed by FireMost notable for Ygritte and Jon’s much-parodied love grotto scene, but also for the Hound’s duel with Bendric Dondarrion, which revealed his terror of fire. Nursing his stump in the baths, Jaime tells Brienne the truth about his assassination of the Mad King. Mid-seasoner. The denouement of the fifth series is the most sympathetic we ever see Cersei, as she completes her walk of atonement through the streets of King’s Landing, her hair cut and her clothes stripped. Strategically, humiliating Cersei proves not to be the masterstroke the High Sparrow thought it would be. 5973 15. Season seven, episode four: The Spoils of WarSpoils aplenty. Arya returns to Winterfell and sees Sansa, then fights a brief duel with Brienne that shows just how much she’s learnt. It’s nothing on one of the great shots of the whole series, however: Daenerys riding Drogon above a Dothraki horde in full charge before incinerating the Lannister lines. 6073 14. Season one, episode 10: Fire and BloodWe were promised dragons, and here they are, mewing atop the naked Daenerys. And one thing we know about baby dragons is they must grow up. This is Game of Thrones’ version of Chekhov’s rule about guns. You’ll keep watching until they torch something. As the big battles go, the showdown between the Night’s Watch and wildlings and the wights at Hardhome doesn’t quite match some of the others, but it is still dead cool, especially when Jon realises his sword works against the snowmen. If that wasn’t enough, Sansa also learnt that her family might be alive. 6273 12. Season four, episode nine: The Watchers on the WallThe big set-piece between the Night’s Watch and the wildlings. Not quite up to Blackwater’s standards, despite its battle specialist Neil Marshall being summonsed back to direct.  There is too much crammed into this episode, which could have been spread over several hours, but it’s wonderful stuff all the same. Jon meets Daenerys for the first time, Sam cures Jorah of greyscale, Cersei obliterates the Tyrells. Best of all is Diana Rigg, at a table in her tower, bowing out from what is perhaps Thrones’ best overall performance. One of the most isive episodes, as Dany’s frustrations spilled over into a holocaust in King’s Landing. Whatever you thought of the pacing, or the plot’s fidelity to the characters, it was quite a spectacle, and killed off several key figures in dramatic style. Poor old Hodor. The death nobody wanted, as a wonderful character, played so sympathetically by Kristian Nairn, is finally given his due. 6673 8. Season four, episode eight: The Mountain and the ViperOther things happen: Littlefinger takes over the Vale, and the Boltons move into Winterfell, but the episode is mainly memorable for the central duel, as Oberyn seeks justice from the man who murdered so many of his relatives, and for one image above all, of the Mountain’s armoured fingers crushing Oberyn’s skull like a grapefruit. Poor old Ned Stark. The death they said could never happen! Clearly they had not watched enough Sean Bean films. After two scene-setting episodes, The Long Night finally delivers on the promise of season eight, with 90 minutes of marvellous blood and fire at Winterfell. The Night King’s hordes meet the assembled ranks of Westeros, wildlings, Dothraki and Unsullied. The defenders lose and lose and lose until they finally win, although not before a few spectacular deaths. If it lacks some of the strategic nuance of other battles, it compensates with stunning action sequences and CGI, especially on the dragons, who dogfight high above the plain.6973 5. Season six, episode 10: The Winds of WinterWinter has come. It opens with peak Cersei, as she eliminates all her remaining enemies in one enormous blaze. Arya kills Walder Frey. The Jon Theory is confirmed. Tommen walks out of the window. 7073 4. Season three, episode nine: Rains of CastemereThe Lannisters send their regards. Some would have this number one, and one could easily make the case. The Red Wedding was the scene that broke Game of Thrones out of its fandom and into broader popular culture, the point where it was no longer avoidable. Fury, anguish, love, surprise, pity, hate: it’s all here. The look Roose Bolton gives Catelyn Stark when she reveals the chainmail he is wearing to dinner might be my single favourite moment of the whole programme. 7173 3. Season six, episode nine: Battle of the BastardsAnyone who has seen Mel Gibson’s Mayan drama Apocalypto knows that running in a straight line away from arrows rarely works. So it proved for Rickon, setting up one of the great battles not only on TV but on any kind of film. Where in previous seasons battles had occasionally felt hampered by budget, most egregiously when Tyrion was knocked out and missed the whole thing, this was the full belt and braces. It was brilliantly directed, with aerial shots, as well as face-in-the-mud close-ups to convey the full grinding horror of the battle, and the grim relief of victory. The fourth season is the best all-round, I think, the high-point of character development before it started to be forced by the machinations of the plot in the later series. Brienne’s bloody brawl with the Hound leaves him bleeding and broken, as Arya heads off to Braavos. Tywin finally gets his comeuppance, a crossbow bolt on the loo, administered by his son, Tyrion, who then flees. And Stannis’s cavalry arrives to save Jon and defeat Mance Rayder and the wildlings in a pincer movement, having been persuaded by Davos. This is purely a personal view, but if Ned Stark’s death was the moment you sat up and paid attention, Blackwater was the where you started cheering at the TV. The scale, the splendour, the depth of character brought to bear on grand events: they all felt new, somehow. This might have been the last moment where we were equally rooting for both sides, except for one side to be consumed in an eerie green glow. Wildfire doesn’t care who your favourite character is. There has to be a loser. ‘Eastwatch’ throws away one of the most important pieces of information in the whole show, Jon’s true parentage, as well as lots of good reunions. It’s the clearest example of how rushed the show has become in recent years, as its unpredictability gives way to conventional plot. 273 72. Season four, episode three: Breaker of ChainsJaime appears to rape Cersei next to Joffrey’s corpse. The scene is confused, unpleasant and different from the books in confusing and unhelpful ways.

If that wasn’t enough, Sansa also learnt that her family might be alive. 6273 12. Season four, episode nine: The Watchers on the WallThe big set-piece between the Night’s Watch and the wildlings. Not quite up to Blackwater’s standards, despite its battle specialist Neil Marshall being summonsed back to direct.  There is too much crammed into this episode, which could have been spread over several hours, but it’s wonderful stuff all the same. Jon meets Daenerys for the first time, Sam cures Jorah of greyscale, Cersei obliterates the Tyrells. Best of all is Diana Rigg, at a table in her tower, bowing out from what is perhaps Thrones’ best overall performance. One of the most isive episodes, as Dany’s frustrations spilled over into a holocaust in King’s Landing. Whatever you thought of the pacing, or the plot’s fidelity to the characters, it was quite a spectacle, and killed off several key figures in dramatic style. Poor old Hodor. The death nobody wanted, as a wonderful character, played so sympathetically by Kristian Nairn, is finally given his due. 6673 8. Season four, episode eight: The Mountain and the ViperOther things happen: Littlefinger takes over the Vale, and the Boltons move into Winterfell, but the episode is mainly memorable for the central duel, as Oberyn seeks justice from the man who murdered so many of his relatives, and for one image above all, of the Mountain’s armoured fingers crushing Oberyn’s skull like a grapefruit. Poor old Ned Stark. The death they said could never happen! Clearly they had not watched enough Sean Bean films. After two scene-setting episodes, The Long Night finally delivers on the promise of season eight, with 90 minutes of marvellous blood and fire at Winterfell. The Night King’s hordes meet the assembled ranks of Westeros, wildlings, Dothraki and Unsullied. The defenders lose and lose and lose until they finally win, although not before a few spectacular deaths. If it lacks some of the strategic nuance of other battles, it compensates with stunning action sequences and CGI, especially on the dragons, who dogfight high above the plain.6973 5. Season six, episode 10: The Winds of WinterWinter has come. It opens with peak Cersei, as she eliminates all her remaining enemies in one enormous blaze. Arya kills Walder Frey. The Jon Theory is confirmed. Tommen walks out of the window. 7073 4. Season three, episode nine: Rains of CastemereThe Lannisters send their regards. Some would have this number one, and one could easily make the case. The Red Wedding was the scene that broke Game of Thrones out of its fandom and into broader popular culture, the point where it was no longer avoidable. Fury, anguish, love, surprise, pity, hate: it’s all here. The look Roose Bolton gives Catelyn Stark when she reveals the chainmail he is wearing to dinner might be my single favourite moment of the whole programme. 7173 3. Season six, episode nine: Battle of the BastardsAnyone who has seen Mel Gibson’s Mayan drama Apocalypto knows that running in a straight line away from arrows rarely works. So it proved for Rickon, setting up one of the great battles not only on TV but on any kind of film. Where in previous seasons battles had occasionally felt hampered by budget, most egregiously when Tyrion was knocked out and missed the whole thing, this was the full belt and braces. It was brilliantly directed, with aerial shots, as well as face-in-the-mud close-ups to convey the full grinding horror of the battle, and the grim relief of victory. The fourth season is the best all-round, I think, the high-point of character development before it started to be forced by the machinations of the plot in the later series. Brienne’s bloody brawl with the Hound leaves him bleeding and broken, as Arya heads off to Braavos. Tywin finally gets his comeuppance, a crossbow bolt on the loo, administered by his son, Tyrion, who then flees. And Stannis’s cavalry arrives to save Jon and defeat Mance Rayder and the wildlings in a pincer movement, having been persuaded by Davos. This is purely a personal view, but if Ned Stark’s death was the moment you sat up and paid attention, Blackwater was the where you started cheering at the TV. The scale, the splendour, the depth of character brought to bear on grand events: they all felt new, somehow. This might have been the last moment where we were equally rooting for both sides, except for one side to be consumed in an eerie green glow. Wildfire doesn’t care who your favourite character is. Despite the concern, Martin recently told readers of his blog that he won’t be involved in any writing on the brand new HBO show.Game of Thrones\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Its mass would be higher than our own planet, but not as large as the ice giants Uranus and Neptune that inhabit our own solar system.If the possible planet is confirmed, it could show us how lower mass planets are formed around small stars, the scientists write in a new paper published in the journal Science Advances.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas flom fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telelscope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

Scientists believe that they largely come about in the snowline, where they are at the right distance from their star as to have water turn into solid ice, but the planet would dwell much further away than that zone.Newly discovered planet \u0027likely\u0027 to support life, say scientistsThe other known planet that inhabits the same solar system, which is known as Proxima\u0026nbspb, already thrilled astronomers when it was discovered. It is described as perhaps one of the best places anywhere for humanity to potentially find life, with all the right conditions, and is close enough that it could one day be visited by robots from Earth.Scientists have long wondered whether Proxima Centauri could have another planet orbiting around it.That became even more of a possibility when the\u0026nbspAtacama Large\u0026nbspMillimetersubmillimeter\u0026nbspArray observatory in Chile spotted an unknown source of light spectrum signals coming from the solar system. At the time, scientists wondered whether the mysterious light was coming from another planet, leaking out from a nearby galaxy – or if it might be something else entirely.In the newly published study, scientists analysed further data about the signal. They found that changes in the light indicated that a planet could be there – but that further examination would be needed to confirm it.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And it is currently under review by the Migration Advisory Committee (MAC), due to report to Boris Johnson’s government by the end of this month.If lower-paid EU workers miss the deadline to apply for the new status, they may never be allowed to work in the UK again, as they would be treated as new migrants below the salary threshold, said Mr Evans.Created with Sketch. Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.His warning came as a senior cancer researcher said scientific support staff from EU nations were already being put off applying for jobs in the UK because they fear they will be caught by the salary requirement.“One of the first questions they ask me is ‘Is the UK still open to immigration?’” said Cancer Research chief clinician Prof Charles Swanton, describing the loss of skilled EU workers as “potentially catastrophic” to scientific work.EU Parliament has ‘grave concerns’ about Home Office settlement schemeCurbs on legal challenges to be fast-tracked ‘in revenge for Brexit’EU confirms there will be border checks inside UK under Brexit dealPM condemned by peers over plans to let courts overrule EU lawHe told BBC Radio 4’s Today: “I see no justification for a salary threshold for highly skilled workers. We have some incredibly skilled workers who are paid a lot less than £30,000 a year.”Speaking on the eve of Thursday’s publication of new Home Office statistics on the processing of applications for settled status, Mr Evans called on businesses to ensure that staff are helped to obtain settled status, which will allow people with more than five years’ residence in the UK to continue to live and work in the country after June 2021.He warned of a “forgotten Brexit” for EU nationals who fail to register for the new status and are forced to leave the country or fall into a precarious life of undocumented work in the black economy.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive updates on politics every morning by email“Businesses have an obligation to support their workforces and reach out through their supply chains to ensure that any EU staff and their dependants are helped through the scheme,” Mr Evans told a seminar in London. “The damage to British industry and the risks of thousands being forced into unemployment, or undocumented work and possibly modern slavery must not become the forgotten Brexit.”And he added: “Brexit must not become this generation’s Windrush. History has shown us that promises made now are not always upheld later and we must act now to ensure EU nationals continue to be protected by their fundamental rights.”The most recent Home Office statistics, released last month, showed nearly 2.6 million EU, EEA and Swiss citizens had applied for settled status by the end of November.More than 2.2 million of the claims have been completed, with 59 per cent receiving settled status and 41 per cent “pre-settled status”, which allows them to remain in the UK until they have totted up a full five years’ residence before applying to switch to full settlement.Despite a success rate of almost 100 per cent for those whose applications have been processed, Mr Evans said many EU nationals were believed to be putting off filling in their forms or to be unaware of what they need to do, with the vast majority thought to be in employment in the UK.“The future salary threshold for EU nationals coming to work in post-Brexit Britain has been well publicised at a possible £30,000,” he said.“For many, their income will fall below this level and understandably, they are worried about completing their applications for fear of being rejected. It is vital we debunk this myth, and employers take action to ensure their workers are guided through the settled status process to secure the status and rights that they are eligible for and to prevent disruption to business operations.”With the future supply of EU workers at risk, the Aire Centre said it was even more vital for\u0026nbspbusinesses to hold on to their current workforce, particularly as iniduals from EU nations are likely to be over-qualified for the roles they have in the UK.According to figures from Oxford University’s Migration Observatory, EU nationals make up 7 per cent of the UK labour market, with the figure rising to 21 per cent among low-skilled jobs in the factory and construction sectors. Retail and manufacturing are also particularly dependent on European staff, with 50 per cent of all EU nationals in the UK working in these industries.Susan Banister of the Slave-Free Alliance warned that many people from mainland Europe are working in conditions of modern slavery in the UK, trying to pay off debts to organised crime groups, and risk missing out on settled status because they are unaware of their rights.“It is in the gangs’ interests to not tell these people about their rights, especially the need to apply for EU settled status,” she told the meeting. “If they lost their legal status this makes them more vulnerable and more reliant on the traffickers. They are truly trapped in modern slavery.”The Migration Observatory’s director Madeleine Sumption, said: “EU workers are employed right across the UK labour market, from science and research positions to low-wage factory jobs.“More than half of highly-educated workers born in new EU member states were in low and medium low-skilled jobs in 2018. This means they are more likely to work in jobs for which they are over-qualified, one of the reasons EU citizens have been so attractive to UK employers. A range of industries have become quite dependent on this workforce. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp“The government faces a big challenge getting all EU citizens through the settlement scheme.“Regardless of how easy it is to apply and how well the scheme is communicated, there will inevitably be people who simply don’t realise that they have to do it.“This challenge is compounded by the fact that there are no accurate figures on how many people are eligible to apply: the most commonly used estimate of 3.4 million is almost certainly too low. So it’s possible that hundreds of thousands of EU citizens could fail to apply without this being clear from the data.“One of the big questions for the next couple of years will therefore be whether the deadline is extended or, as some have suggested, removed entirely.”Mr Evans said: “The contribution EU workers make to the UK economy and to business is unquestioned, but many are put off by the red tape and complicated process. Businesses need to take action now, and failing to do this is tantamount to ignoring a ticking time bomb on a boardroom table.”A Downing Street spokesperson said that\u0026nbspMAC had been asked to review the salary threshold for future migrants, adding: “The prime minister has made clear we want to be welcoming to immigrants and want to attract the brightest and best to the UK.”A Home Office spokesperson said: “These comments, made by an organisation we fund to support EU citizens, are quite simply wrong.“The government has made it repeatedly clear that we want EU citizens to stay, and 2.5 million people have been granted status already.“There is plenty of support available, and EU citizens still have well over a year left to make an application.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The survey of 3,835 members between 8 and 13 January, consisted of LabourList readers, which the website said was weighted by Survation to reflect the membership.\u0026nbspBut given those polled\u0026nbspare drawn from LabourList’s database of readers, who identify as members and are likely to be more engaged than the average party member, it may not be representative of the party’s entire membership.\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

She askedthey wanted to join her in the “mile-high club”, then attacked cabin crew who refused her more alcohol.Demi Burton tried to headbutt and kick six crew members and passengers who tried to restrain her before she was arrested when the plane landed.In court, the -year-old claimed she had been drinking because she has a fear of flying and said this behaviour is out of character, which may be true.Her defence lawyer Martin Callery said: “She is thoroughly ashamed of herself . . .  and utterly embarrassed at the way she behaved.”But that is certainly not the impression she conveyed outside court, where she gleefully flicked obscene hand gestures at photographers.No doubt she stopped smiling when she heard she had been sentenced to six months in prison. Personally, I’m not sure how effective prison is. But the problem with reckless behaviour is that you have to face the consequences.And I really hope for Demi, this is the moment she gets her le back on track. We all make mistakes. It’s what we do afterwards that defines us.It would be easy to assume that Demi is a hopeless case. But she is young enough to turn her le around, to work hard, do better and see this rock-bottom moment as a catalyst for change.And then something good will come from what is a very low moment in her le. We don’t have to look far for examples of people who have overcome lapses or mistakes before going on to succeed.Take Robert Downey Jr, who went from drug addict to one of Hollywood’s highest-paid actors. Or Elton John and Robbie Williams, both of whom have overcome major drug issues before enjoying renewed stardom, fatherhood and, more importantly, a good le.While it is not the same as a drunken mistake, anyone who has made it in business will have a good few failures under their belt — whether it is a dodgy commercial decision, plain bad luck or a company that has gone bust.It is not what happens to us in le but what we do next that counts. So I am guessing that, from her cell, Demi might be reflecting on what she might do dferently when she gets out. Andshe isn’t, she should be.Because it is the getting back on the horse that counts, evenit means resisting the urge to go back to bed to hide. No one is perfect. No one gets through le without messing up or things going wrong.Before success, you will get temporary defeat or total failure. The key to getting through it is resilience. And one of the best gts you can give a child is to encourage them not to give up.By the way, I speak here from experience. Like any businesswoman, I’ve made some mistakes and had my fair share of knocks.There are some that I have managed to turn to my advantage and others that I have had to chalk up to experience.The key thing is that I have learned from what went wrong, then moved on. That experience has allowed me to create a mini-manesto on how to fail how to respond to setbacks and failure, which I’ll share here now:Give yourself time to recover and reflect. Force yourself to take small steps to get back on the horse. Do not accept failure. See it as a step on the journey towards success.Remember that challenging and dficult moments are what help you grow bigger or better. Without them, you would stay the same.The only people who haven’t experienced setbacks are people who are too scared to try. So “failure” is often a sign of bravery. Hold your head up high at all times.Try your best and be proud to do so, eventhings don’t always work out the way you want them to. Remind yourself: “Where there is a will, there’s a way.” And as they say, the best thing about the future is it comes one day at a time.ANOTHER new year, another month of looking at photos of scantily clad people on beaches in sunnier climes and asking myselfI am the only person who is not on the beach.This is the time of year for massive bikini-body and holiday FOMO.But let us all take heart that it is also, oh joy, the time of year for elasticated waists hidden under chunky knitwear.Personally, I am more than happy to swap the beach for nothing to shave and no stomach to suck in. Bliss.I’M sure parents everywhere were shocked to read the story of the son who bullied his mother and stepfather so viciously he has been jailed for three years for his controlling and coercive behaviour.When Nicholas Hazell, , of County Durham, went back to live with Judith Ridley, , and her reverend husband Stephen, , after losing his job, he made their lives hell.Hazell, above, created a “horrendous atmosphere” at the family home and flew into a petulant ragehe didn’t get his own way, Durham Crown Court heard.Among his worst outbursts were when Hazell threw his mother into a chair and spat at her while holding a screwdriver to his stepfather’s throat. He also told them: “I am a master of bullying.”It sounds horric.I feel so sorry for his mum, who must be devastated that her little boy turned into a cruel bully as an adult.I dont do needles when it comes to my face.  Lasers, facials, peels . . .  sure. But needles are another story entirely.If you are willing to take the chance of injecting poison into your face, at the very least you want a predictable result. And in my experience, you don’t get it.Who wants eyebrows at the top of their head, lips that come into the room before you do, or a forehead that doesn’t move  Not me, that’s for sure. However . . .This week I read that not only is the gorgeous Abbey Clancy having micro-Botox injections, hyaluronic acid fillers and vitamins, she is doing it with TWENTY needles at once.Abbey, , is having something called an aquagold facial, so called because each needle is covered in -carat gold. The marketing blurb claims this treatment will reduce pores, blur out fine lines and leave your skin with a vibrant glow.Some might say this is a slippery slope to the stronger stuff but Abbey looks amazing.  So it has to be worth a try, don’t you think I HAD to laugh at the photos of the BBC newsreader whose dress, which had burst open minutes before going on air, was cobbled together from behind by quick-thinking colleagues.  Liz Beacon’s outfit was patched up with gaffer tape and bulldog clips.I used to believe what I saw on TV. But since filming The Apprentice, I know all too well that all is not necessarily what it seems.Two examples spring to mind. First, the countless times I have been filmed in the boardroom with a smart jacket on top and leggings or even pyjama bottoms and slippers under the boardroom table.Second, and worse, the time I somehow forgot to bring a bra on a day I was wearing a white blouse.Luckily, a kind crew member who is roughly the same size as me lent me hers.  And the show, as it always seems to do, went on.I WAS appalled to read about the private Islamic secondary school that has been “unlawfully segregating” boys and girls for all activities except weekly assemblies, according to a stinging Ofsted report.One of the teachers theretold pupils “university is not for females”, according to the report. Which begs the question of where, then, is the best place for females  The kitchen Inspectors who visited Birmingham’s Redstone Educational Academy in November last year also found male students were given privileges and treated more favourably than their female counterparts when it came to sports, school trips and work experience.That was something disputed by the headteacher.That’s not good enough. There can be no place for a school like this and it should be closed down.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Perhaps this explains why his Wikipedia entry has just been doctored to delete his status as a “millionaire”. Not me, guv, protests Starmer.He is also weirdly reluctant to declare where he stands on the political spectrum. Is he a Corbynite or a Blairite or a bit of both  “I don’t have the names of former leaders tattooed on my head,” snfs the man named at birth after the first leader of the Labour Party.This knight of the realm, who played violin at fee-paying Reigate Grammar School alongside Fatboy Slim, claims a humble background as the son of a toolmaker.“I know what it’s like,” he insists, asraised in a cardboard box.Well, I went to the same school when it was a “bog-standard” state grammar. My father was a journeyman upholsterer. It didn’t give me any special insights.Starmer boasts in his new campaign video about picket-line stints alongside down- trodden Wapping printworkers — against my boss, Rupert Murdoch, a hate figure on the Left.This chameleon politician was dubbed a “Sir” on the recommendation of Gordon Brown, a title he discourteously declines to use because it invites contempt among those with a vote.His citation was for “services to law and criminal justice”, after a five-year term as DPP.At about the same time he was parachuted into Parliament as MP for rock-solid Labour Holborn and St Pancras, in London.It is here that self-respecting Labour voters should pause and reflect.Many believe these political plums were reward for the longest, costliest and perhaps most spiteful criminal persecution in history — ordered by Sir Keir Starmer.His new leadership video slyly refers to this time, apparently to boost his scourge-of-capitalism image among the “comrades” — even though politics should play no part in a DPP’s decision-making. In a travesty of justice, he rammed two dozen innocent journalists through Old Bailey trials on trumped-up conspiracy charges — a medieval catch-all which even the Crown Prosecution Service admitted was “an extremely dficult and rarely visited area of the law”.The prosecuting counsel was given a flea in his ear for “chopping and changing”, the charges against the journalists.The trials ended with acquittals all round, an admission that “no crime may have been committed” and this rebuke from the Lord Chief Justice:“What concerns me is the freedom of the Press and the desire of officials to contain information.“We must ensure the Press is protected — we can’t use criminal sanctions to undermine their position.”The defendants were all journalists on The Sun or the News of the World — then seen by the Left as fair game.The trials followed The Sun’s decision to switch its support from Gordon Brown’s floundering regime to David Cameron’s Tories.Some believe the two were linked — but surely that’s just a conspiracy theory.What is absolutely clear to those who care about the issue is Starmer’s readiness to use his power to curb Press freedom.As citizens of totalitarian regimes rapidly learn to their cost, without a free Press there is no such thing as free speech.IT’S win-win for the Sussexes and losses all round for the House of Windsor.Meghan’s first kiss-and-tell will be a bestseller, with all the gossip on Randy Andy and those secret royal scandals.Harry’s right-on charities will be milked for millions.Once our revered Queen has departed, the monarchy will dwindle to a sideshow on the US celebrity circuit.Charles is too old to compete and William is too dull, despite Kate’s best efforts.Hero Harry will emerge as victor in this grotesque civil war. I predict he will live to regret it. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are rich beyond the wildest dreams of almost everyone in the UK.They are more than capable of paying for a few bodyguards. Andthey find themselves struggling, they could always cut down on the private jets.The Queen, Charles and Wills must be firm: the Sussexes have made their bed. Now they’ve got to lie in it.A CIVILISED nation treats its veterans with respect.Which is why we were delighted when Boris Johnson won the election on a manesto promising to end witch hunt prosecutions against ageing former soldiers who served in Northern Ireland.But to get Stormont up and running, the Prime Minister has brokered a deal with Sinn Fein which risks opening up new probes into thousands of Troubles veterans. This would be morally indefensible and politically mad.Yes, a working government in Northern Ireland would be a good thing. But the safety and wellbeing of our elderly veterans is too big a price tag.And given Boris won the election by being a proud patriot, it makes political sense for him to stand by the armed forces through thick and thin.If the PM is to hold the hard-earned trust of new Conservative voters, he must never give way to those who would put our old soldiers in the dock.IT would be fair to assume that anyone injecting plastic into someone’s face should have some qualications to do so.But a strange loophole in the law means that though Botox is classied as a medicine in Britain, dermal fillers aren’t covered by any regulation.A staggering  per cent of facial fillers are performed by people with no medical training, often in unsanitary conditions — with devastating results.Which is why The Sun’s Fabulous brand is launching the Had Our Fill campaign, urging for a crackdown on unregulated cosmetic fillers, and raising awareness to help women make safer, more informed choices.We’ve had our fill of dodgy fillers.

Letting them keep their titles to amass a Kardashian-sized fortune cashing in on their royal status will be a grotesque abuse of the monarchy and taxpayers who fund it.What will the public get in   Nothing.Meanwhile this revered ,-year-old institution will be reduced to an Instagram marketing tool for one jaw- droppingly self-centred young couple.We never really thought this scandal could threaten the monarchy.But its image looks in mortal danger and its finances may have to be rapidly reviewedHarry and Meghan still receive seven-figure sums from Charles despite having £million in the bank.We appreciate the Queen’s plight, at  and wanting only the best for the grandson she loves.But this was a moment not for a fudge but for ruthlessness to secure the monarchy’s future: No money, no titles, no using the royal name.Do your duty, in full, or go it alone, in full, as private citizens.At least we heard one dose of sound sense — when Home Secretary Priti Patel angrily rubbished leftie claims that the Press, and Britain, is “racist” towards Meghan.It is fact-free drivel.And this is just about the LEAST prejudiced nation on Earth.This couple have simply raised the bar for self-obsessed, arrogant entitlement.WE sympathise with Labour members ­having to feign enthusiasm for the remaining contenders for Jeremy Corbyn’s job.Mind you, the five finalists could barely do worse than Jezza, possibly except his naive disciple Rebecca Long-Bailey, the Tories’ dream candidate.The rest include sneering Islington lawyer Emily Thornberry, whose loathing of working-class Britain is mutual. And gobby Jess Phillips, who thinks insulting Boris alone will win her power.There’s Lisa Nandy, almost certainly too sensible. And then there’s millionaire QC Sir Keir Starmer, the favourite and the only bloke left, which means Labour is almost sure to pick him since its “ersity” is a pose.But let’s shatter one Labour delusion.None of these scares the Tories. The election’s over. The Government has an -seat majority and five years in power.So we have three suggestions for Labour: bin Twitter, which has been disastrously discombobulating for the party.Forget your juvenile morality war against Boris. It has already failed.Then work out how to persuade voters in  you won’t turn Britain into Venezuela. px,px, px\" data-img\"https:linkangood metric  midwidsidtidridLOADEDcustomwww.thesuncustom%Fwp-admin%Fpost.phpcustomlinkangoodt\" data-srcSet\"https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox   %E%C svg%E\"  px,px, px\" data-img\"https:linkangood metric  midwidsidtidridBEFORE_OPTOUT_REQt\" data-srcSet\"https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox   %E%C svg%E\"  px,px, px\" data-img\"https:linkangood metric  midwidsidtidridFINISHEDcustomwww.thesunt\" data-srcSet\"https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox   %E%C svg%E\"  px,px, px\" data-img\"https:linkangood metric  midwidsidtidridOPTOUT_RESPONSE_OKt\" data-srcSet\"https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox   %E%C svg%E\" Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Why let reality spoil the narrative These claims made about the “racist” treatment of Meghan at the hands of the British Press are incredibly thin.The same non-examples are recycled over and over again. You have probably seen them quoteda thousand times.There is that Mail Online piece from , when Harry and Meghan were first dating, that said she was “ straight outta Compton”.At the time, Meghan’s mother Doria Ragland lived in nearby Crenshaw, LA.Hirsch says this was an attempt to link Meghan with “racialised forms of crime”, meaning gangs.That is one hell of a reach. The piece was clearly just playing on the dference in Harry and Meghan’s social backgrounds.If Harry had been dating a white, working-class woman from Manchester’s Moss Side, I dare say the Mail would have done something similarly silly.Another favourite is that weird throwaway line Boris Johnson’s sister Rachel wrote, in a laudatory piece on Meghan, about the mixed-race American actress bringing some “rich and exotic DNA” to the pale Windsor bloodline. That is more cringey than racist.Several pieces have cited a single phrase in a Sarah Vine column for the Mail — she said she had a “niggling worry” about the royal couple’s engagement photo — as a bigoted dog whistle. That is, quite frankly, mental.Such is the lack of actual examples of the Press being racist about Meghan.The only leg this argument has left to stand on is that the sheer volume of criticism sent Meghan’s way was disproportionate.Racism is the only explanation for it. It’s an argument based purely on unveriable speculation and imputing motives. It is also b*****ks.When the couple first got together, the coverage was gushing across the board.It was only when Meghan and Harry started on their ious virtue-signalling cru-sades — such as jetting around to lecture on climate change — that people’s backs went up.That the couple had already been beefing with the Press probably didn’t help either.In , way before Meghan became a figure in our culture wars, Harry issued a remarkable statement rebuking journalists for the “racial undertones” of their pieces.That these privileged royals, kept in the lap of luxury at taxpayers’ expense, began to develop a deep-seated victim complex only heightened the resentment towards them.Last year, Meghan told ITV public le was a “struggle” and she was shocked that “not many people have askedI’m OK”. Poor princess.This picture of privilege is who the liberal Left has spent the best part of three years defending.Even supposed republicans have — after a bit of anti-royal throat-clearing — defended Harry and Meghan to the hilt and helped con- struct this absurd narrative that they are the victims of establishment racism.This says far more about the prejudices of liberal-Left commentators than it does about the tabloid Press. They routinely suggest Meghan’s supposed mistreatment in Brexit Britain is no coincidence.They think Britain is a foul place full of foul people, brainwashed by foul news- papers to hate the wonderful Duchess of Sussex and the brilliant European Union.What the liberal elite’s Meghanmania shows us is that, for all their posturing against right-wingers, monarchy and the old aristocracy, they are comfortable with the plebs being led, instructed and hectored by our betters.They would just rather it was woke people doing it, like Harry and Meghan. px,px, px\" data-img\"https:linkangood metric  midwidsidtidridLOADEDcustomwww.thesuncustom%Fwp-admin%Fpost.phpcustomlinkangoodt\" data-srcSet\"https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox   %E%C svg%E\"  px,px, px\" data-img\"https:linkangood metric  midwidsidtidridBEFORE_OPTOUT_REQt\" data-srcSet\"https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox   %E%C svg%E\"  px,px, px\" data-img\"https:linkangood metric  midwidsidtidridFINISHEDcustomwww.thesunt\" data-srcSet\"https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox   %E%C svg%E\"  px,px, px\" data-img\"https:linkangood metric  midwidsidtidridOPTOUT_RESPONSE_OKt\" data-srcSet\"https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox   %E%C svg%E\" Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

For how much did they really know about each other before walking down the aisle Prince William apparently advised his more impetuous brother to wait so he could really get to know his American bride first, but Harry took umbrage and didn’t listen.Perhapshe had, he might have worked out in advance that an independent spirit joining such a restrictive institution wasn’t going to end well.Instead, they leapt before they looked and, with the “-month bride” having packed her bags already, have saddled the -year-old Queen with yet another constitutional crisis.Back in , I wrote a piece defending Meghan after she was criticised by old school friend Ninaki Priddy for being “calculated in the way she handled people and relationships” and a “curator of a beautul le”.But following the lavish baby shower, the jet-setting with A-listers and the swt jettisoning of inconveniently outspoken family members, the latter sentiment now rings true.And, of course, becoming a member of the most famous royal family in the world was the cherry on the top of that beautul le.But Meghan soon discovered it was nothing like the membership of her beloved Soho House.The rooms are draughty, the decor chintzy and, instead of reading the morning papers in your cashmere loungewear, you have to rise early, put on a frock and make your way to some rain-lashed outpost to open the new wing of a community centre where “live your best le” sentiments, however well-meaning, aren’t required.Here’s what is required as a member of the British Royal Family: Turn up on time, shake hands, smile, say little more than “have you come far ” Repeat.Not because the royals don’t have anything to say. They do, and air their views in private.But in public, their job is to shine a light on whatever project they’re visiting, not themselves. To show — via action, not virtue-signalling statements — a strong sense of duty.And inthey get to keep their ious mansions, hundreds of staff, personal bodyguards etc without any whf of civil unrest.That’s the deal.But those still in Meghan’s social circle glowingly describe her as organised, focused, and opinionated — very much an independent woman used to having her voice heard.As Prince Harry told courtiers just before their wedding: “What Meghan wants, Meghan gets.”An admirable quality when it comes to breaking through the glass ceiling of corporate le or securing the best table in the best restaurant, perhaps.But the monarchy is an institution steeped in hundreds of years of tradition, and Meghan — who claimed she “didn’t know much” about Harry when they first met — clearly thought she’d mould it to her way of thinking . . . then rapidly discovered that it ain’t for turning.Not that The Queen didn’t try very hard to accommodate the wants and needs of the newly anointed Duke and Duchess of Sussex.Contrary to royal tradition, they were permitted to keep the christening of baby Archie as a private affair and, despite there being a perfectly nice home at Kensington Palace they could have used, a publicly funded, £.million renovation of Frogmore Cottage was authorised.A “cottage” I might add, that used to be five homes but has now been knocked in to one because they managed to dodge the usual ban that prevents such moves because of the UK’s housing crisis.Shortly after, Prince Charles launched his blueprint to try to solve the dilemma faced by millions of young people struggling to find a home of their own. Oh the irony. And after all that, they now want to use it part-time as they flit back and forth across the Atlantic.Meghan is feeling disillusioned and homesick. We get it, and sympathise.But let’s not pretend, as some claim, that she’s been practically pitchforked off this island by racist bigots.This is not a racist country and, besides, the British public initially greeted her engagement and later marriage to Harry with unbridled joy.We love Harry. He’s a thoroughly decent person and deserves particular praise for the work he’s done with the Armed Forces, both while serving and afterwards.No, the disconnect has come from the fact that Meghan is still a Hollywood celebrity at heart and, consequently, never truly settled in her often boring and restrictive new role.She misses the relative freedom of her old le, not to mention her family and friends.Again, we get it. But was it really necessary to flee these shores asescaping for her le Clearly besotted with her, Harry faces the stark decision of giving her what she wants or losing her for ever. Or perhaps he’s genuinely sick of royal le and wants out too.If so, let’s wave goodbye and wish them luck.But. The have-cake-and-eat-it plan to stop being a “senior royal” and just dip in and out of duties that suit them simply isn’t going to work.SussexRoyal — which Harry and Meghan have registered as an official trademark for everything from “emotional support services” to clothing and magazines — is a title and privilege that comes with duties and conditions attached, not a brand, be it charitable or otherwise.The future of the monarchy depends on the goodwill, support and interest level of the public, and a recent survey showed that, while the majority have no issue with their decision to go, they were strongly against any continued taxpayer funding of their lavish lestyle.So— as early indicators go — The Queen allows Harry and Meghan to call the shots while keeping their royal titles, their taxpayer-funded security and an allowance from the Duchy of Cornwall, then one suspects this will be discussed by students for centuries to come as the turning point at which the British monarchy began its steady decline to irrelevance and, ultimately, abolition.MOVIE mega-star Will Smith popped in to the retirement party of a woman he last met  years ago.Anita Scipio was the receptionist at a US radio station when Will arrived for one of his first interviews as a young actor and he’s never forgotten how nice she was to him.“My favorite moments on the road are the ones where I can connect with people like @anitascipio,” -year-old Will told his Instagram followers before he walked in to the station to give her a hug.In the days before social media, someone who worked at his record company Sony told me that whenever he was in town, Will would tour the building, from post room to boardroom, giving time to everyone.He’s that rare creature, a star on screen and off.Some of today’s petulant slebs should watch and learn.FORMER psychiatric nurse Susan Evans is launching a landmark legal case to challenge consent issues around the provision of puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones for under-s.She argues that children should be protected from “experimental” and “invasive medical treatment”, not least because “some children are referred despite having autism, being homosexual or suffering some form of trauma or sexual abuse”.Speaking on Radio , she added that children as young as nine were being asked to consent “to a completely experimental treatment for which long-term consequences are not known”.But gender ersity advocates warn that “a loss to trans youth is a loss to all”.Time will tell the outcome of her case but, meanwhile, in unrelated comments, I note that the actor Rupert Everett says he spent most of his early childhood wanting “to be a girl”.He adored his mother, aunt and grandmother, didn’t like men, and adds: “I loved necklaces and bras and all those kinds of things.”Then, when he reached , he “didn’t want to be a girl any more. I really enjoyed being a homosexual”.The case in point, perhaps, for treading very carefully indeed with pre-teens.POLICE officers will be required to have degrees from this year – a move that could remove , recruits from the front line while they complete their studies.Sigh.

While I have bought several mobile phones, I have never gone shopping for an entire telecoms network.But surely there must be other potential contractors. Don’t we have a telecoms industry of our own It doesn’t say much for the Government’s privatisation of BTit is not in the running for this sort of work.What about our own Vodafone, which I thought was one of the world leaders in mobile phone technology Evendepriving Huawei of the work meant we had to wait a little longer or pay a little extra to download a movie to our phones, that would surely be a reasonable price to pay for protecting national security.And national security policy really is at stake.Yesterday the US reaffirmed that allowing Huawei to build our G network — even parts of it which are deemed to be low- risk — would be “madness” and could compromise the willingness of the US to share vital intelligence with Britain in future.This didn’t come in one of Donald Trump’s notorious am tweets but from officials working for Matt Pottinger, the US deputy national security adviser, and Robert Blair, special representative for international telecommunications policy.That they took the trouble to visit London to warn of the dangers we could be getting ourselves into ought to be seen as a red flag on Huawei’s involvement in our G network.Surely, the importance of being able to share intelligence with our most important ally should rank above pure considerations of cost.Australia has already blocked the Chinese firm from its G network.Yet here, the head of MI Sir Andrew Parker said he had “no reason” to think Britain’s intelligence partnership with the US would sufferinvolvement from the Chinese firm was given the green light.But Defence Secretary Ben Wallace underlined at the weekend that the US administration has threatened to cut off some intelligenceBritain approves Huawei’s involvement in G.He said: “Those things will be taken into account when the Government collectively decides to make a decision on it.”Our own Government — as it has been doing since Theresa May’s day — insists that only parts of the G contract would be awarded to Huawei.It would not be allowed to work on security-critical areas.But that isn’t good enough. Such is the complexity of modern telecommunications networks that it would be impossible to be sure that systems installed in one part of the network were not enabling data to be obtained from another.Whoever designs and builds a telecommunications system gains the power to interfere with it, or even switch it off, should it feel inclined.Of course, with modern communications a huge amount of damage can be done from afar.Evenwe are confident our broadband network is secure now, we can’t be certain that would remain the case.A company which installs a telecommunications network will necessarily continue to be involved in maintaining and upgrading the network it had designed and installed.We have to be absolutely sure the network is not being used for some underhand purpose.Huawei denies that it is controlled by the Chinese state, and has threatened to sue commentators in France whom it alleges have made that claim.But the precise relationship between Huawei and the Chinese state is hardly the point.What is certain is that China is not a democracy and there is always going to be a security issue when it comes to involving its industrial giants in sensitive work here.We would not allow a Chinese company, say, to build fighter jets for the RAF or to construct our radar defence system.This kind of work is rightly the preserve of contractors on whom we can rely totally, even in times of international conflict.Such is the importance of telecommunications in military and civil defence that we now have to think of mobile networks in the same light.The Government has been warning for years that cyber warfare is the big coming threat.In  it published a Strategic Defence Review which defined cyber attack as a “Tier One” threat alongside terrorism.Last November, the US and Taiwanese held a joint exercise in fending off a major cyber attack on Taiwan.At the time the Taiwanese Cyber Security Agency said it was the subject of an astonishing million cyber attacks every month, half of which came from the Chinese mainland.So why, then, is our own Government even considering commissioning a Chinese company to install a telecommunications network Of course, Boris Johnson is right to make it clear he is not Donald Trump’s poodle.We don’t have to take notice of everything the Americans say, on defence, trade or anything .But when it comes to our closest ally warning us that it might not want to share intelligence with us in futurewe let a Chinese company build our G network, we very much do need to take notice.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Harry and Meghan have said they wish to be “independent”. A lot of time has been spent working out how that independence can be achieved.Well, here’s the thing. I have a cunning plan for the Sussexes as to how they might be “independent”.What you need to do is get something called a “job”.If you get one of those they give you money which you can use to buy things — a house, some Pot Noodles, a Hot Wheels car racing set — anything, really, within reason.  Remarkable, isn’t it It probably wouldn’t pay for the £million Canadian mansion Meghan is holed up in right now — but they can always ponce a few freebies off their mega-rich friends.It might not quite cover the legal costs Meghan may incur from her upcoming court case. She’s suing a newspaper and her dad is set to testy AGAINST her.You have to say she has a knack, this lass, of getting on the wrong side of quite a few people.I think it’s fair to guess that the Royal Family are not entirely happy with her right now. So she’s hacked off her new family much as she’s hacked off her own one.It’s no huge surprise they’re both heading off to “Canada” .Meghan seems not to like the UK very much. She doesn’t spend much time in it and my suspicion is that the local people haven’t entirely taken to her.We had a bit of time for Harry, once. He seemed an amiably thick rugger-bugger with a mischievous sense of humour. Not any more, sadly.He seems to spend half of his time crying. And he also seems to have swallowed whole the air-headed, ultra-woke, touchy-feely drivel his we has imported from the United States.Still, we were happy to spend an extortionate sum doing up their “cottage” with the most expensive materials money could buy. And we were delighted to see photographs of young Archie — once we were allowed to by madam.For someone who dislikes the starchy formality of the Royal Family, Meghan displays quite a few airs and graces, doesn’t she Hates being photographed and gets her bullying minders to stop people taking snaps. Loves being photographed when she’s promoting herself or her vacuous ideas.But hey, they love each other and that’s the important thing.Let them move to Canada or LA, where they can jabber to each other about climate change and how everyone who doesn’t like her is racist, until the cows come home.But let them do it entirely independently. No money from the Duchy of Cornwall Estate. No royal stipend. No security staff paid for by the taxpayers, either here or there.Let them be truly independent, which is what they seem to wish for.Maybe they’ll find it liberating. Or maybe in a year or two Prince Harry will wake up and think: Crikey, what have I done.DO you remember when you first had a McDonald’s  I remember very well. I was  and had just come down to London from Middlesbrough.My girlfriend told me about these wonderful things called Big Macs. I tried one – couldn’t believe how delicious it was. So I bought another, and then another.Stood there, stuffing my fat face, eyes wide with delight.As the years go by, the pleasure diminishes a little – there’s nothing better than tasting something delicious for the first time.So lucky, lucky people of Rutland. The UK’s smallest county is to have its first ever McDonald’s.A lot of poncey residents opposed this happening because they said it would “lower the tone” of the county.Now the snobs can find out what they’ve been missing all these years.RIVETED with excitement by the Labour leadership contest  It’s a real humdinger, isn’t it I had rather hoped David Lammy would stand, just to give us all a laugh. Sadly, he’s not going to.Ultra Trot Clive Lewis has pulled out. But Emily Thornberry, above – Lady Nugee to you, you lowly serf – is through to the next round.If she wins it will be the final nail in the coffin of this once-great party.SO, Manchester City’s underperforming stars hired a whole bunch of Instagram “models” to attend a party at some posh place in Cheshire.Flew them over from Italy, shoved them in a hotel, Bob’s yer uncle.The wives and girlfriends of the players were not invited to this party. Lovely bunch, footballers, aren’t they And was all of this sanctioned by the supposedly progressive and right-on manager, Pep Guardiola “That was not what I meant, Senor Aguero, when I said you had to get in the box more often.” HERE is yet another Re-moaner head case for you. Liberal Democrat peer Lord Greaves.He has said he fears Britain will be reminiscent of Nazi Germany when we finally leave the European Union. Yup, that’s a sane and rational judgment, you bearded loon.He added: “People are crying when they go to sleep at night and when they wake up in the morning, and all they get from the unfeeling, hard-headed Tories is moans.“They are feeling a sense of loss which is akin to bereavement, and a grieving process has only just begun.“In these circumstances, triumphalistic behaviour, festivals of Brexit and all the rest will simply make things worse.”Who is crying  What bereavement process  What kind of drugs is Lord Greaves taking Let’s all go round to his gaff on January  with a few cans of Stella and try to cheer him up.A BRITISH mum is leading a fightback against the drive to make our children cretins.The unnamed woman went on Mumsnet to explain that she turns the house wi off at .pm every night.And tells her three kids – the oldest is  – to read a book instead. Good for her. Children seem to use the internet for just three things.Bitching about thots in their school. And sending snap-shots of their genitals to -year-old men who are pretending to be teenagers.THERE was a rather cheering plan to ring out the church bells across the land to mark our escape from the European Union at the end of the month.But a bunch of bishops have said we shouldn’t do that because the bells should only be used to summon the faithful to worship.With the greatest of respect, your reverend, b*****ks. You can tell it’s nothing to do with that by their comments.One said: “Two thirds of the population never voted for Brexit in the first place. It’s deeply isive to ring church bells for something like this.”Yeah, Bish – we have a habit in this country of only counting the votes of people who voted, you mimsy frock-wearing halfwit.Another said: “I think we should be ringing bells on February , not to celebrate Brexit but to call people together to pray for our nation at this critical time.”Ah, go shove your bells up your cassock, you miserable Remoaner God-bothering bores.A UKRAINIAN bloke woke up one morning to discover a large metal nut around his old fella.His we had placed it there during the night to stop him shagging other women. And presumably her.It seems to have worked. He couldn’t get the thing off. So he went to hospital where they removed it with a circular saw which spat out sparks as it tore through the metal.I don’t think his todger will be doing very much at all for the foreseeable future.He should have kept the thing on.

The distinctive peal from its massive, .-ton bell is a part of the soundtrack of our public le.But sadly, it now seems likely that the advent of Brexit will be met by silence from Big Ben.If the parliamentary authorities have their way, no sound will echo from the clock tower on that momentous night.Since , the building has been undergoing a major renovation programme, including the installation of a lt, resurfacing of the dials, and restoration of the clock mechanism.According to the House of Commons Commission, which oversees the Westminster estate, the cost of interrupting this work to enable Big Ben to chime for Brexit would be more than £,.We are told this huge bill arises because of the need to install a temporary floor in the belfry to support the chiming equipment — as well as the impact of delays, for up to four weeks, in the renovation project.In the view of pessimistic officialdom, the whole idea of the Brexit chimes is just too expensive.As Sir Lindsay Hoyle, the new Speaker of the Commons, put it this week, “You are talking about £, a bong.”The arch-Remainers have, predictably, seized on the problem with glee.For them, the entire business is just like Brexit itself — a pointless, costly distraction.That negativity is shared by large parts of the civil service and Westminster establishment.Viewing Brexit with horror, they seek to prevent any inspirational commemoration of the event.So the supposed heavy costs give them the perfect excuse to do nothing, just as they used bureaucratic stalemate to thwart Brexit for years.Indeed, the Big Ben dficulty can be seen as ato Project Fear, once more, where dire financial warnings are deployed to frighten the public into inaction.But the British people did not give in to Project Fear , and they should not be cowered by more alarmism this time.The shrill negative voice of Remainers had dominated for too long.After the decisive General Election last month, that is the noise that should be hushed, not the chimes of Big Ben.Expressions of national pride are a force for benevolence and unity, as we witnessed in the recent cricket World Cup triumph.Despite all the Remainer gloom, there is a tremendous yearning to celebrate British-ness.That spirit can also be seen in the broad popular support for the idea of a new Festival of Britain, in , to extol the values of our nation.Once again, just as with their negativity over Big Ben, the pro-EU brigade sneered at the concept as nothing more than a Festival of Brexit, which could only enshrine entrenched isions.But in reality, just like the successful post-war Festival of Britain in , the  Festival could achieve the very opposite, by enabling us to reconnect with our identity, heritage and future.The same can be true of the Brexit chimes on January . It can be an occasion for joy and openness, not misery and fearfulness.Boris Johnson’s suggestion that the £, bill could be met by an appeal to the public is being scuppered by senior officials.In his usual inimitable style, Boris had asked for crowd-funding citizens to “bung a bob for a Big Ben bong”. There were signs the campaign could be taking off.The passionate Euro-sceptic MP Mark Francois pledged £,, while there was also speculation that millionaires such as Lord Ashcroft and Wetherspoon pub chain boss Tim Martin could make large donations.Officials yesterday said there was “no legal basis” for using public donations. So why shouldn’t the Government chip in  After all, the state is used to bankrolling exceptional national events, often at a far bigger cost.A reported £million went on Meghan and Harry’s wedding in .Most of that was swallowed up by security, but £, alone went on her bridal dress — which is not far off the cost of the Big Ben bongs.Similarly, the bill for the chimes is barely a quarter of the more than £million estimated to be spent on the official London fireworks display on New Year’s Eve.But before any money is handed over by the public or Treasury, the huge potential bill — £, to get the bell to chime, plus the £, cost of delays to the tower’s repair — must be challenged.In all kinds of major projects, because of weak management, contractors and consultants often expand the budgets for their own interests.We have seen that process with the HS rail link, now on course to cost over £billion, while even with the renovation of Big Ben the project’s bill has risen from an original £million to £million.On Tuesday night, one former project manager in Parliament said the estimate for the chimes had been absurdly inflated.“I cannot believe the costs you’re talking about,” he told LBC radio.The can-do, anti-establishment outlook ensured the victory of Brexit. With the same imagination and drive, the campaign for the Big Ben chimes can succeed.In fact, it could be the cue for a string of other celeb-rations across our land on January , like bonfires, fire-work displays or big screen-ings in city squares.But at the centre of it all has to be the Westminster clock tower. As Nigel Farage put it, “If Big Ben doesn’t sound, our country looks like a joke.”The miserabilists and pessimists must not get their way.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

You will have your throats ripped out, Ive seen your faces. I will be speaking to your mummys and daddys [sic].Lyons narrowly avoided a prison sentence after pleading guilty to grievous bodily harm, dangerous driving, assault and failing to stop and report an accident.Judge Simon Berkson told the mum-of-two who had a previous conviction for drink driving, the boys were innocent victims of you using the vehicle as a weapon.He added: They were playing a teenage game that has been played in this country for decades.This was a very dangerous piece of deliberate bad driving and you are fortunate the injuries are not worse than they were.The group of boys had been playing the prank, also known as knock down ginger, in the days leading up to the attack on January  last year.Myles Wilson, prosecuting, said the kids ran away after targeting Lyonss home.But  minutes later she borrowed her partners BMW  Series to go to the shop.On her way back she saw the kids at the entrance of the housing estate where she lived and she accelerated at them.All four wheels of the car mounted the pavement and she claimed the teenagers had been swearing at her and that she had driven slowly at them.However photos from the scene revealed tyre marks on the pavement contradicted that account.In a victim statement, the injured child said he still suffered from anxiety after the attack.Another said that he wasnt able to get Lyonss angry face and noise of the engine out of his head.Lyons, who apologised to the boys as she left the dock, was given  months in jail, suspended for  months and a two-year driving ban.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

If  grammar school boys,  besuited City workers,  MPs or  police officers were stalked for years by a gang of sex abusers, it would cause legal and social upheaval.  But  poor girls from south Manchester  Girls who were poor, born to parents who could not look after them, in care, with no hope, no way out, and no prospects, girls who seem pre-destined for a le of abuse, crime, and addiction  Well, letaposs not be too hasty, lads. We donapost want to make Rusholme look bad. We donapost want to put too much pressure on the police. We have enough problems with race. These girls arenapost angels. And there might be political concerns. Letaposs just agree itaposs all very sad and shut down the investigation because we know all about it, now.The report into the Manchester grooming scandal which was published yesterday quotes one detective who helped arrest and charge a rapist who was not Asian. He said: It was a prosperous middle-class area, and they were well-to-do kids. They werenapost from the original tranche of children that were in childrenaposs homes... we were told to try and get other ethnicities.If you raped a rich kid, you got nicked. And coppers werenapost told to catch rapists. They were told to tick boxes. In Rusholme, Rotherham, Peterborough, Oxford, Rochdale, Bristol, Telford, Newcastle, Aylesbury, Huddersfield, and Keighley, the children who should be most protected by the state were hung out to dry by servants of that state. The authorities ignored, covered up, and swept under the carpet hundreds,not thousands, of horrying crimes.Many tried, and failed, to get their managers to act when girls were injected with drugs, groomed, raped, beaten, made pregnant, given abortions, and had their children taken away. But all too often, the authorities were wilfully-blind partners in the abuse. This is what happens, when you politicise the police with locally-elected crime commissioners. When chief constables get too pally with council leaders. When social workers are blamed for not doing the things politicians stop them doing. Well-funded childrenaposs services look after children. Police officers who donapost care for politics chase criminals of all races. And an NHS with the time and staff to track, counsel and help the most dficult people it has to deal with can link up with other services to see the full picture, not just the black eye. Butyouaposre one of the unlucky ones, youaposre on your own. Five years ago, Professor Alexis Jayaposs report into child sex abuse in Rotherham found that white and Asian girls were victims of men who were of Pakistani, Kosovan and Kurdish heritage. They were mostly Muslim, but included other races and faiths too. White victims were more likely to come forward, but were not treated fairly because of officials contemptuous about race, class and gender.The rapists told their victims - which included Sikh, Hindu and Muslim girls - they were targeted because they were the wrong sort of girl. And everyone seems to have taken the rapists at their word. The bigger truth is they were targeted because they didnapost matter. Black or white, they were poor. They were girls. And they didnapost matter to their rapists, the police, or the politicians.  When Victoria Agoglia died of an overdose aged , the coroner recorded a narrative verdict saying she was known to grant sexual favours to men infor drugs.Two months before her death, Victoria had reported that she was being raped and injected with heroin by an older man. No effort - none - was made to help her. And even so, a coroner said her rape was a favour she had granted. Every rapist picks someone they can control. Someone who wonapost be believed. And what better victim than a kid in care, with track marks on her arms. Britain has created a new underclass. People who, more than a century ago, were called the undeserving poor, people who made their own problems and did not observe the rules of dress, work and manners that the God-fearing, hard-working poor did.  The Victorians changed their minds about the poor, eventually. Journalists exposed the scandal of children sold into prostitution, laws were changed, slums were cleared, living standards improved. When the boom of the s was replaced by the Great Depression and everyone feared the breadline, moves began for the welfare state that was introduced only after two world wars had destroyed our class barriers.A century on, weaposve built those barriers again.There are places only some sorts of people live, eat, and work. They get less money spent on them. The streets are not swept as often. The landlords go unchecked. The schools are expected to be bad.It is those places who bred the rapists, and their victims. They created ignorance, otherness, and a world with dferent rules. Racism of all sorts festered, to the point that men of all faiths believed poor girls were easy meat, and the rest believed it was just what men like them did.The same places have bred county lines drug dealers, kne gangs, and other socially-expensive forms of misery. This underclass consists of hundreds of thousands of people, victims and criminals, and untold thousands of children who are still being raped.  Lessons were learned after the Rotherham scandal was first exposed in . They were learned again when a gang was jailed in , in  in Rochdale and the House of Commons, in  after the Jay report and again in  and , after  men and  women were convicted. But their crimes dated back to the s. The council knew of them in the s. Predominantly-male local officials, whose own families were unlikely to be victims, ignored it all and decided it was more important they got re-elected.The lessons learned are usually that victims must have their crimes prosecuted. Itaposs all but useless for most vulnerable children, who distrust the authorities, who are kept apart, addicted, or who see no way out. A prosecution makes bugger all dference to the basic problem which is that we now asks ourselves who deserves justice, and who does not.  To the short-sighted, Islam is to blame, or takeaway owners, or those of Pakistani origin. To others, itaposs the state, the namby-pamby social workers, or Labour councillors who didnapost want to upset their voting base.Very few think this is down to all of us. Since the s when this pattern of abuse began, we have ided our nation into people who deserve to do well, and those who donapost. People who work hard, and those on benefits. Those we want to live next door to, and those we donapost.We have not noticed it, but all the evidence shows we have also ided ourselves into people who deserve to be victims, and those who deserve a police investigation. Those who deserve hope, and those doomed to hopelessness. This wound on our soft underbelly will kill us, unless it is disinfected. The people most in need of help, of good schools, of education, and the full attention of all the authorities, must get it - and at the expense of those who can manage without it. The lessons have not been learned. Tough sentences will not stop further offences. Someone like Victoria is being raped, today, not because of race or religion but because more than one person has decided that child deserves to be raped. The only way to stop it is to admit that weaposd all be in that underclass, with a little bad luck. And tell our leaders that no-one deserves to be stuck in it.

They placed the seven-and-a-half centimetre long arachnid amongst a few leaves and a house spider in case it got hungry. The Chinese Swimming Scorpion, or Lychas mucronatus, is not deadly but its sting can be painful and the venom injected can cause a burning sensation in the skin.

While Prime Minister Justin Trudeau tweeted over Christmas the pair were always welcome as they spent the festive period in Vancouver, the newspaper has said the governmentaposs response should be a simple and succinct: No. The Globe and Mail went on to describe the Sussexesapos plans to move as vague and evolving and not something that Canada can allow. But this countryaposs unique monarchy, and its delicate yet essential place in our constitutional system, means that a royal resident – the prince is sixth in the line of succession – is not something that Canada can allow. It breaks an unspoken constitutional taboo, the article said.  And while the piece admitted Canadians like their own monarchy, with visits tending to produce outpourings of public enthusiasm no royals should set up a home on the premises. Instead, they prefer members of the Canadian firm to kept at armsand reign from a distance, adding: Close to our hearts, far from our hearths. Princes are not shipped over here when no useful duties can be found for them on the other side of the Atlantic, it continued. Canada welcomes people of all faiths, nationalities and races, butyouaposre a senior member of our Royal Family, this country cannot become your home.  There has been much debate about how the Sussexesapos plan to become financially independent will work, particularly when it comes to personal security. The editorial was adamant Canadaaposs issue with the move was not about the feds having to find a few million extra bucks to accommodate the couple. Instead it suggests Canadians are ided on the royal issue itself, but reports the government has offered to pay for Meghan and Harryaposs security at a cost of millions a year have angered many citizens. The Duke and Duchess removed a line from their new website claiming they are internationally protected people entitled to personal security wherever they go. One of the key points of discussion at Mondayaposs crisis summit at Sandringham was the Sussexesapos annual security bill, which is understood to be paid for by the taxpayer. Launched last Wednesday, the rebellious Duke and Duchessapos new official website Sussexroyal initially included the controversial phrasing about their security entitlement. But this was deleted in a matter of hours of it going live, reports the Mail Online .  The new website also states that  per cent of their annual funding comes from the Duchy of Cornwall, the Prince of Wales’s private estate, estimated at around £billion. And with their intention to relinquish the Sovereign Grant, it is understood Prince Charles made it clear he does not have unlimited funds. Harry and Meghanaposs wedding, as well as fitting out Frogmore cottage, all cost millions and it is unclear how far the Prince of Wales is willing to bankroll the pair. Any future funding is likely to impose firm rules on their commercial ventures, with the couple expected to look to make millions abroad. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said thereaposs still much to discuss over the Sussexesapos proposed move to Canada. The Sussexesapos desire to move has raised questions over the costs of the coupleaposs security during their time in North America and who would foot the bill.  Asked during an interview with Global News on Monday whether Canadian taxpayers would have to pay, Mr Trudeau said: That is part of the reflection that needs to be had and there are discussions going on. Weaposre not entirely sure what the final decisions will be, what the dispositions are and those are decisions for them. I think most Canadians are very supportive of having royals be here, but how that looks and what kind of costs are involved, there are still lots of discussions to have. He said the federal Canadian government had not been involved up until this point about what the coupleaposs move to the country will involve.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailA mum says she managed to save her babyaposs le because of a piece of advice she heard on the This Morning TV show. Danielle Sampson, , from Gilfach Goch, Wales, said she recalled Dr Ranj speaking about aposrescue breathsapos when her newbornaposs airways became blocked.She has told Wales Online of how she desperately performed the manoeuvre on her sonaposs leless body while taking him to hospital.Ms Sampson had been home with her newborn for just  minutes before she took him back to the doctors on a motheraposs instinct. Fletcher Jack Williams had been born the day before in the early hours of October  at lb  oz after Danielle went through a long  hours of labour. There were no signs at the hospital that Fletcheraposs airways were blocked, but Danielle now knows one nostril was blocked with mucus and Fletcher was exhausting himself trying to breathe through the other nostril, as babies mostly breathe through their nose. Hyper aware to respiratory issues due to her eldest son, Ewan David Thomas having cystic fibrosis, Danielle soon noticed something was not right. She said: He wasnapost in any distress because of it but I noticed he dipped in his breath and I just thought something was not right. My partner kept telling me to go to sleep because I had a hard labour and was tired but I just couldnapost. I donapost know what would have happenedI had gone to sleep. He was really lethargic and I tried to breast feed him but he would not latch because he couldnapost feed and breath at the same time, he wasnapost getting enough oxygen, said Danielle. She noticed Fletcheraposs breathing was rapid, and one side of his nostril looked sunken. Like a lot of new born babies, Fletcher was repeatedly sneezing and at one point managed to dislodge whatever it was that was blocking his airways. Danielle said she tried to pull the mucus, which is common in the first  hours after a babyaposs birth, from his nose, however Fletcher did a deep inhale to compensate for the lack of oxygen previously, which caused the blockage to become stuck again. She and her partner Fraser Williams quickly decided to rush newborn Fletcher to nearby Princess of Wales Hospital. Sat in the back of the car holding Fletcher for the  minute drive, Danielle said he soon started to detiorate. She added: I was just thinking I have got to keep him with me, I was saying to him aposCome on Fletcherapos but we were about ten minutes away from the hospital and that is when he went completely limp.  He was leless, his eyes were rolling at the back of his head. I was tapping his bottom, and flipped him over on his belly just to get him to gasp but that is when I remembered they donapost breathe through their mouth. And it just came to me instantly to do the rescue breaths. Danielle explained she has previous training in doing adult CPR but has never been taught what to do on babies and children. She added: I saw the rescue breaths with Dr Ranj on This Morning and it must have been about two years ago now. I always have This Morning on in the background but it was one of those things that caught my attention. I wasnapost even pregnant at the time but my middle child was two at the time. I remembered it well because with baby CPR you are supposed to breathe over their mouth and nose. I remember thinking I have to do something but I was worried as he was so tiny I didnapost want to breath too hard and I have only ever done CPR on plastic dummies before. Danielle remembers seeing her partner look back at her in complete worry but after doing three breaths over Fletcheraposs mouth and nose, to his parentapos relief, Fletcher let out an exhale. She said: He wasnapost doing deep breaths but it was enough, I had obviously moved the mucus enough to clear his airwaves to breathe.

The Prince will be the face of a new mental health awareness campaign which will run during the tournament. Everyone involved in the event will be taught how to look after their mental health. Rugby League isnapost just a sport, itaposs a community, Harry said in a recorded video message released ahead of the launch. And one that takes care of its own. For many years, it has been at the forefront of promoting and supporting good mental fitness, working hard to build a positive mindset for everyone involved in the sport. So, I am proud to support the Rugby League World Cup  Mental Fitness Charter.  This Charter will build on the brilliant work already happening in rugby league by committing to training and educating all those involved in the tournament and the wider rugby league family, not only in how they can look after their own mental fitness but also support others to do the same. Last week the -year-old and his -year-old we announced their plans to reduce their royal duties and spend more time in North America, while also working towards becoming financially independent. The public announcement caught the rest of the royal family by surprise and left the Queen and other senior Windsors hurt and disappointed, royal sources have said.  A friend of Harry and Meghan said the couple felt they had been driven out. Following a family summit at Sandringham on Monday which was attended by the Queen, Harry, Prince William and Prince Charles, it was agreed that the couple would split their time between Britain and Canada. Although we would have preferred them to remain full-time working members of the Royal Family, we respect and understand their wish to live a more independent le as a family while remaining a valued part of my family, the -year-old monarch said in a rare, highly personal statement. Currently Harry and Meghan are not allowed to seek private income. Instead, most of their money comes from the private estate of Charles.

She paid tribute to her daughter Toni who didnapost sleep as she lead the hunt for Tommy: She was like a machine, Sandie said. She was amazing. There were so many little things that had to happen and he lead her to him. Itaposs amazing how many people picked up CCTV footage going up the roads to Babbacombe.  Toni began her search long before the emergency services listed Tommy as an official missing person. She said: He lead me to him. I just felt like he left his phone so that he could be found. Thataposs why he didnapost take it with him. It was found by the police at Walls Hill. But it was Toni who pointed police and coastguard rescue teams to Walls Hill. She described how she spent three sleepless days and nights collecting information until she was able to tell police where to look: I got them to the point  yards from where he was, up the lane. Toni found CCTV showing Tommy in his distinctive white puffer jacket as he walked from the Maha Bharat Indian restaurant toward Babbacombe Road in Torquay. He could also be seen passing Torwood Gardens on Sunday morning. After that Toni began knocking on doors where people had CCTV and she gradually built up a picture. The final piece of the puzzle showed him walking near The Range - but a bus passed him and he disappears from sight. Tommyaposs family realised he must have turned off a path leading to Walls Hill. Toni, , was very, very close to Tommy, who would have turned  next Tuesday. She said: I found him by just following the CCTV and knocking on doors. I followed him to his last point. I didnapost sleep - I just kept getting the CCTV and we just had to keep following it.Tommyaposs phone was found just as Storm Brendan brought dangerous weather conditions and police appealed to the public who were out looking for Tommy to stop.Toni said: We had to stop the search because the weather was so bad. They had found his phone - I know he left it for me to know where he was. I just wish I could have saved him. Tommy also leaves a younger brother, Louis, . Toni said: Louis always says there is only one way to describe Tommy - he is unique.

A second low-pressure front brought further strong gales to much of the country on Tuesday, causing the roof of an apartment block to crash into Slough High Street in Berkshire. While in west London, part of a roof collapsed on tube line tracks at Ravenscourt Park during the high winds. As a result there were severe delays on the Piccadilly and District lines.  And just as Britain was picking itself up, it appears every day until Monday could be a wash out. Lighter spells of rain are set to be mixed with heavy bursts meaning traffic is likely to be hit hard, particularly for those looking to take a short weekend break. The MeteoGroupUK is predicting near gale force north-westerly winds in parts of the country for Thursday, with the miserable weather continuing in the foreseeable future.  Its forecasts say there will likely be cloud tonight with rain in eastern parts of Scotland and England, while western areas will be partly cloudy with a few light showers and rain will linger in south-east England. And this is likely to be followed by scattered showers tomorrow, as well as patches of cloud and the odd sunny spell. Forecaster Ms Verasamy said: Into Friday brighter skiesonce more, a touch calmer, but lumpy downpours across the north and the west. While on Sunday things could take a turn again with wintry showers across the north-west of Scotland, as well as westerly winds. However, temperatures are set to remain fairly mild, reaching highs of C over the weekend.  UK  day weather forecast Today: Dry start for many, but another dose of wet and windy weather spreads eastwards later this morning and afternoon with heavy bursts of rain for some. Clearer skies and showers follow into the west later. Windy, especially in the west. Tonight: Daytime cloud and rain clearing eastwards, finally clearing far southeastern England during the early hours. Clearer skies and showers, some heavy, follow, mainly into the south and west.

The forecast suggested a polar freeze is on its way, with snow hitting the north-east, Ireland and Wales in late January before making its way to eastern parts of Britain and Scotland. But Met Office meteorologist Bonnie Diamond that the reports are based on a  weather forecast for two weeks ahead, which is too far away to make an accurate predictions. Ms Diamond told the Daily Star thereaposs no sign of oncoming snow in the Met Officeaposs forecasting system.  And while thereaposs always a chance of snow showers in winter, it will likely only affect high ground in the northern parts of the country, which is pretty normal for January. While the winter has been relatively mild for much of the UK, a high pressure system will see temperatures drop this weekend, unlikely to rise above °C. She added that there could also be icy conditions in some parts of the country. Snow charts by WXCharts, which they say look at the probability of snowfall, show the entire country covered in the white stuff on Tuesday, January  and Wednesday, January . Netweather also predicts a likely chance of snow hitting the entire country on Tuesday, January . It appears to hit in a southeasterly direction, before engulfing all of the UK.  The Met Office forecast for the end of January and start of February reads: “Through the end of January into February, we are likely to have higher pressure across the UK than during previous weeks. “The northwest will probably see the wettest and windiest weather whilst further south and southeast it should be drier and brighter with an increased risk of frost and fog.

Emily wrote: Mat threw it away weeks ago and then we found it inside on a wooden bench. Okay…so we were weirded out and tightly wrapped it in its own garbage bag and put that garbage bag INSIDE another garbage bag filled with other garbage and put it in the bottom of our garbage can underneath a bunch of other bags of garbage and wheeled it to the curb and it was collected on garbage day. The family then went on holiday, thinking the whole thing was behind them, but when they ed home, the doll was back. We were out of town, forgot about it. Today Aurelia says, aposMom I saw the Elsa doll again in the backyardapos, she continued. WHAT !  After throwing it out didnapost work, Emily decided the only way to be rid of the thing for good was to send it far, far away. So she posted it to her friend Chris, who lives over , miles away and had been entertained by the tale of the aposhauntedapos doll. She confirmed Chris has since received Elsa and has taped the creepy toy to the bonnet of his car to stop it from going anywhere . Fingers crossed it stays there!

Last year, he was given a suspended four-month jail sentence for a terrying campaign of intimidation and harassment against a local family . He was also known to gardaí for minor drugs and road traffic offences. Confirming the human remains were those of Keane, Droghedaaposs Garda Chief Christy Mangan said: This is a brutal and savage attack on a child - it is completely unacceptable in any normal democratic society.It is important to remember that Keane was a child, a young boy trying to find his way of le. He has now lost his le and his family have lost their loving son. Weaposre there to protect and serve the public, but there are a number of groups who are interested in controlling certain parts of society and their own lestyles through drugs and intimidation. Weaposre not going to allow that to happen. Weaposre there to protect the people of Drogheda and will certainly do that in a very robust fashion. The last known contact Keane had with family is a call to a woman at pm on Sunday.

As they flee for their lives, one man falls at the feet of the enraged elephant and nearly gets stamped under the animalaposs giant foot. Luckily he manages to get up and escapes an almost certainly lethal trampling. The elephant hits him with his trunk before turning around around and walking back into the forest as the tourists scarper. Locals said a group of  elephants had left the forests to find food but one of them had followed by a large crowd of villagers. The incident happened at Hosur, in Tamil Badu, India, earlier this month. It came just days after -year-old Vengita Lakshmiyamma was trampled to death at Kudisaganapalli village on  January. The two incidents took pace in the same forest range. Dozens of people die in India every year in elephant attacks with a signicant but unquantied number of those attacks down to people trying to grab photos with the wild beasts.

I like watching them when they go forward but we need to find a way to hurt them with our style of play as well.“It should be a good game for people to watch.”Saturday’s visitors Motherwell have enjoyed an impressive season in the top flight, sitting in the best-of-the-rest position in third behind the runaway top two of Rangers and Celtic.Stephen Robinson has been in charge at Fir Park for almost three years now and has overseen an upwards trajectory of the club.Dens boss James, though, isn’t shocked to see the Steelmen flying high this term, however.He added: “No, it hasn’t surprised me.“You can see why the manager has been successful with his recruitment and the way they play.“They can beat any team in that league from what I’ve seen of them this season.”This season is Motherwell’s th in the top-flight after last playing in the second tier in .And that sort of longevity at the top table of Scottish football is something Dundee should be enjoying, according to their manager. vw, px\"  James added: “They have been in that league for as long as I can remember.“I said this at the start of the season – five years isn’t long enough for a club like ours to be in the Premiership .“People were saying we had a good run at it but no we didn’t.“We should be in it every year – as should our neighbours.“When you look at Scottish football, you want the derbies.“It was horrible when Hearts and Hibs weren’t in the same league so you didn’t have the Edinburgh derbies and it was the same when Rangers and Celtic weren’t in the same league.“The Dundee one is all right just now because we are both in the Championship.“But, for me, you want the better games in your top league.“But going back to that question, yes, we want to be a club that can sustain a position in the top league for  years or beyond.“Looking back at Motherwell, to be there from  is a long time staying in a league.“We did five – it is not enough.“We need to get back up and stay there.“The problem is, there are loads of teams saying that.“Not many can do it so credit to Motherwell.”Kick off on Saturday is .pm at Dens Park with the match shown live on BBC Scotland."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/01/5e1ee386761c51.80867316-e1579104702563-940x564.jpg ","title":"dens gaffer we wont be bullied","story":"James McPake admits there has been “loads of interest” in attacking midfielder Josh Todd.However, the Dundee boss won’t be allowing any player to leave unless he gets players in the door first.And he insists the club won’t “be bullied” into paying over the odds for players.The Tele revealed this week Greenock Morton and Falkirk had expressed interest in the -year-old former Queen of the South man.James said: “There is loads of interest in Josh.“I have had a few phone calls about him.“But nothing will happen until I sit down and have a proper conversation with him.“He did great in a bounce game on Tuesday and attitude-wise he has been great.“He doesn’t look like a player who wants to leave.“Maybe he has been saying that he has not been getting the game time but he needs to ask himself why that’s the case.“Can he get himself into the team or is he looking to go where  I don’t know. Anyway, nobody will be going anywhere unless I get someone in.”The Dens gaffer admits that hasn’t been easy to do, however.The Dark Blues have been heavily linked with a move to bring Craig Wighton back to the club as well as St Johnstone midfielder Ross Callachan, with a deal for the latter apparently rubber stamped.“We are trying to get people in but it is proving to be dficult,” added James.“I can see now why, when the question is asked about this transfer window, people say it’s more dficult to deal in.“It is a lot harder and teams are digging their heels in a lot more.Teams are trying to bully us because it’s Dundee. They are trying to bully us into paying extra money, which isn’t going to happen. There is a structure here that we are not going to go away from.“If that means we are priced out of a player then so be it.“We certainly won’t be bullied.”On the Wighton deal, he said: “I am not naming names but I have had conversations – certainly not with Ann Budge, who has been great to deal with – where it has been said that we can pay more than other teams.“It seems a player can go to one club for the money they are offering but not to us for the same amount of money.

“immediately”.He added: “That might include internal works first which people won’t be able to see.”As well as the removal of the old main arena building, the covered walkway that connects to the

January   and all work must be completed by then.It is understood that the remaining conference centre will be retained as well as the nearby park-and-ride facility.Talks regarding the future use of the site are still ongoing.Plans were previously submitted to the local authority by developers Henry Boot in May  for the land, which hoped to create a mixed use development including approximately  residential units, properties for commercial and business use, a recycling centre and park-and-ride facility.The application is still pending and there was a number of documents uploaded on to the

Its dog-eared pages contain neatly-typed records, precise drawings and fascinating photographs.The log#s mystery is deepened by the fact no names are given other than the nicknames #Tanky#, #Bosun#, #Skipper# and #Pilot#. The only crew member named is pet dachshund #Major#.The log does record the Fulmar#s home port was Tighnabruaich and the owner was RG Mowat, but few details on Mr Mowat could be found.Lord Weir of Lochhead, Achahoish, contacted the newspaper to pass on information on Commander Ralph G Mowat.During the Second World War, Commander Mowat was a Royal Navy Captain, latterly in command of a cruiser. At the end of the war, he and his ship entered Copenhagen, where he took the surrender of the German troops.Clive Brown from Ardfern added some post-war detail. He revealed: #Commander Ralph G Mowat, RN , was a distinguished member of Clyde Cruising Clubbest known as being, for  years, the honorary editor of the CCC Sailing Directions . These were # and indeed remain # a #must have# for everyone who navigates their way among the many lochs and islands of Scotland#s west coast. They were colloquially known as the #Blue Book# and published at that time as a hardback. He also served as CCC Rear Commodore -.#Mr Brown also provided an extract from the book #Clyde Cruising Club, The First One Hundred Years -# which states Ralph Mowat received an RYA Award for services to yachting in  but refused to accept honorary membership of the club. In recompense, his widow Mary was elected an honorary member in , after his death.Tighnabruaich man Alan Wilson contacted Clyde sailing legend Ian Nicolson, who was fairly sure he recalled racing against the #Fulmar# in the s.Mr Nicolson said:#Old Man Mowat, as I remember him, was a typical ex Royal Navy officer. He treated me as a young upstart, which I was, but we got on well because I wrote a bit for Clyde Cruising Club publications. He lived in Clarkston on the edge of Glasgow.#Clyde Cruising Club itself cannot help with information on the Fulmar. Club secretary Jenner Rollands contacted the Advertiser and confirmed CCC sadly lost all its records when the Carrick, moored on the River Clyde, sank in . At the time, the club#s office was aboard her.Closer to home, Ardrishaig man Billy Paterson called into the Advertiser offices to say his father, Ardrishaig Primary School headmaster Gilbert Paterson, had crewed the yacht Fulmar.Mr Paterson still has mementoes from his father#s trips in the form of gts from Commander Mowat, including a paperweight from , a copper and brass barrel ashtray dated  and a brass model yacht with #Fulmar # engraved on it.Thanks to everyone who contacted the Advertiser with their memories.We now know a little more about Commander Ralph G Mowat, RN , owner of the Fulmar.Details about the crew of #Tanky#, #Bosun# and #Pilot# remain, however, sketchy, soanyone out there knows any more#"},{"url":null,"title":"my new year resolution is","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards"},{"url":null,"title":"plenty of christmas room at the inn","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowInveraray Senior Citizens committee hosted its annual Christmas lunch in the Inveraray Inn.The event, on Sunday December  for senior citizens of Inveraray, was well attended with everyone enjoying a delicious meal and musical entertainment provided by Lochgilphead#s Easy Club.During the festivities, the committee presented flowers to Diane MacDonald, who is retiring from the committee after nine years."},{"url":null,"title":"a mid argyll rugby blast from the past","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowTayvallich reader Donald Carmichael handed in this black and white photograph of a Mid Argyll Rugby Club team of many decades ago.But can our readers name the players  And what background can you give us about this photograph and Mid Argyll Rugby club at the time Contact the Argyllshire Advertiser by email: editor@argyllshireadvertiser with any information."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column december 27 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLooking back over the last  months, no single story has dominated the headlines in these pages, but there have been important themes.There are the negative trends, of course.

Three events all within a stones throw of Mid Argyll.Jamie Miller was the only local to enter this event, starting his Scottish Tarmac Rally Championshipcampaign for the year in the rapid  Citroen CR. Paul Hunter, swapping his pacenotes for spanners, was on hand to assist Jamie throughout the season. Conditions were said to have been tricky as Knockhill has its own micro-climate, which consists purely of rain, wind, snow, ice, wind and wind. Sadly it wasn#t to be at Knockhill for the team with mechanical failure ending their day after stage two.The first closed road event to take place in England, after the approval of closed road rallying for the UK, was the first event for the famousGTi. Unfortunately for Kirsty Mochrie her licence can only be upgraded to stage events from single venue use when she turns , so it was theof the pairing of Innes Mochrie and Paul Hunter to represent Mid Argyll south of the border. The pair, finding the conditions tricky in the narrow lanes after the top seed cars had been pulling mud from verges and ditches, managed to bounce the wee metro over the first loop of four stages until the gearbox had enough on the fth test.Following the cancelling of Inverness# Snowman Rally earlier in the year, this was now first round of the Scottish Rally Championshipfor Dougie Watt and Ian Parker, and it was interesting to say the least. A glance outside in the morning to see about four inches of snow lying on the roof of the MK Escort was a surprise for a start. A very wet and muddy day saw the pair make it to the finish in one piece which is more than can be said for the clutch cable that snapped about one mile into the final stage, however clinching their first class win of the season was the best start to the championship.With Kirsty #Wee Mo# Mochrie in the co-drivers seat in the rapid Corsa of Steven Hay , a fair pace was set by the pair throughout the day sitting as high as th until they unfortunately had to take a split early to save damaging the car. Back out the next stage and still setting a blistering top  pace in the Corsa, including some hang time on both the jumps.Jamie, back out in the fit C, had bad luck once again. This time an overshoot on a square right and a struggle to get the car started again after a stall sadly earned him a stage max on stage two. Still setting top  times on the day he ended nd which was a fair effort when you include a stage maximum time.Ian was out this time with Fraser #Flat oot Fraz# Smithafter winning an entry to the rally at the STRC Awards in January. Flying out the gates and onto their second lap on the first stage then pop, driveshaft burst. Towed in and sorted, both covered in CV Grease, they made it back out for a skid around and on a mission to tear up some old tarmac tyres.The Granite Stages, now held at RAF Leuchars would see Eoghan Anderson make ato the passenger seat for a hurl in the immaculate MK Escort of Martin Murray. Smiling ear to ear all day, with Bill eagerly awaiting histo the service area for the stage report, they finished th overall.Ian was out with Greg Inglisin his fluorescent Orange Lotus Exige and it was eyes on the prize for STRC points for Greg. A clean day saw Greg really getting to grips with the car on some surprisingly fast stages including a tickle of the limiter in fth saw the pair finish third overall.Back together and with the small repairs from the Speyside done it was time for the Furnace MK toto the woods. A steady run over the opening two stages, Dougie and Ian found their feet after the #off# at the Speyside sent them into service lying th. From seeing their overall position they knew they had to get back into it on the next stage, however on the road section to start stage three there was issues selecting gear and the pair decided to call it a day # damage limitation was the right call, as the input shaft was on its last legs.Jamie was back on the pace for this one, setting a th fastest stage time on the opening test. Sitting th overall heading into stage five was impressive given the competition on the day. Bad luck unfortunately, however, was to .Eoghan was again out with Martin in the MK for a blast. Sadly it was an early bath, retired after stage two but again, as always, enjoying every minute while it lasted.The Argyll rally had been known to have rough and challenging stages the previous two years. Not this time. Ian and Dougie couldn#t believe how good the stages were in comparison to previous years, an absolute joy of an event with the Escort not missing a beat all day on its #shakedown# for the big one. Valuable class points added to the scorecard too, with them ending the event nd overall. The rally had struggled with entries this year and will now run in  as a closed road rally, run by Mull Car Club.Team Mochrie were back together for this one in the Mightyagain and Innes was cutting some questionable shapes in the garage, performing his annual Mach rain dance. Taking chunks of time from his first passes of the stages would see them ring the #s neck and clinch th.Jamie#s luck had finally turned, the C singing all weekend and netting him a topper of th overall and th fastest over the final stage too.Duncan Maclean was back in the driving seat with Ian alongside, giving himself and the car a shakedown before Mull. The freshly rebuilt #blue bullet# was looking superb and managed to finish looking just as sweet. A couple of small teething problems were sorted on the day and the new main focus was to have power steering fitted before Mull # poor Dochy lost about a stone over two days with the effort needed to swing the wee pug around the #s and chicanes.In August Dougie and Ian competed on the Vetomies Rally. A national grade event run alongside the WRC Rally Finland event. Three other crews from Scotland also headed over to sample #the fastest rally in the world#. The stages were unbelievable. Fast, cresty, wide, flowing with a brilliantly smooth surface. The whole event was just surreal. The duo finished the event th overall and more importantly the fastest Scottish crew.Once the car had ed from Finland it was quickly jacked up, checked and loaded onto the trailer the same day for the journey north. Due to two DNFson the Speyside and Scottish, Dougie and Ian had to make the trip to be in with any chance of regaining their class lead in the SRC. Ending the day first in the class meant they were heading into the final round with the lead.Jamie was back out for another counting round of the STRC. Enjoying his day and pushing the wee C on in the blistering heat netted Jamie and co-driver Ian Mccullochrd overall. He must have been relaxed in the heat as in between stages he was off with the overalls and on with the baby lotion, topping up the tan.Ian was back out with Greg in the Lotus. Another fantastic drive from Greg, finishing ninth with the championship title race firmly the primary goal.The final round for the MK and an important one # a DNF here could see Dougie and Ian losing the class lead in the championship. A battle with their rival who they had been chasing all season, Paddy Munro, would come down to the last stage, as the pair were six seconds down on Paddy heading into the final test. Probably one of the duo#s best stages all year, the final push to claim the class honours came down to the finish of the last stage on the last rally of the year. One second! They had taken the class win and the championship.The first event this year for Craig Callander and son Ross would see them prepare Craig#s gravel spec Subaru Impreza at the last minute to take on their favourite event. The #Japanese Tractor# was a fair handful, a light steering alignment issue and a boost problem gave the pair some trouble although finishing th overall made up for the hassle. A fair result given Craig#s absence from tarmac for four years.Returning from the shed with his freshly painted Sunbeam was Alister Macarthur, this time with Claire Tilleyalongside. The freshly fettled #beam was looking and sounding good # crossing the finish th overall after two years out of the seat.Dochy and Ian were back out in the #blue bullet.# All was going well until they had a spin coming over a crest into a square left, losing the bumper and damaging the gear linkage. They managed to get the car back to the end of the Saturday afternoon leg to repair the gear linkage and almost stole the yellow bumper from the recce car until some legends appeared with the duo#s bumper in the back of their Land Rover. Back out onto the  mile #long one# on Saturday night and they had an issue # after a heavy landing over a crest the rear shocker bolt broke, making the car a handful to keep in a straight line. They had to finish another two stages before they could make it back to service, so a finish was all they wanted at this point # th overall and Dochys fourth finish in a row on Mull.Without doubt the driver to watch was Innes and his newly acquired co-driver Lewis Grfiths . The Mightywas spotted airborne at any chance, with the hydro can suspension screaming for a break at each service halt. It was almost all over as the nearside cv joint sheared and the car took a wild turn to the left # both Innes and Lewis thought they would end up IN the Belachroy pub. They managed to make it over the Lochs to the end of the final stage, claiming st overall.Eoghan was back out with Martin to settle the score from the DNF at the summer stages. Sadly a stage maximum time on stage two scuppered their chances of the overall result they were hoping for, however they did set some impressive times, clocking a th fastest time on the final stage.Jamie, back out for the final round of the STRC, was looking to continue his good run from the Pendragon and set a seventh fastest time on stage three in the extremely wet and tricky conditions. Trying to get his money#s worth from his entry fee Jamie, however, decided to take an extra couple of miles on the penultimate stage. Still, the C ran well all day and the conditions suited the car perfectly.Ian was back out with Greg and this time he was aiming to become the Scottish Tarmac Rally Champion for . They set off with five cars in the same class and they had to win the class to get Greg the honours. Setting the pace early they were leading throughout the event. Finishing the event first in their class and third overall meant the job was done # Greg claimed the championship win.The last event of the year saw Kirsty back in the co-drivers seat, gaining even more experience on her path to upgrading her licence. Some typical Knockhill weather was in store as Kirsty had her first taste of RWD rallying in the Mazda MX of Paul Sheard. Kirsty guided Paul around the very wet stages to claim th overall and some valuable points on the board for Paul#s Motorsport News Championship campaign.Special thanks to Alasdair MacConnell who has travelled many miles to don an orange bib and stand in the rain, wind and heat, all to show his support and play a vital part in any event.

All have end-stage organ failure, be it kidney, liver, lung or heart, and require a le-saving transplant.Organs for transplant usually come from bodies of people who agreed to donate before death. But as this does not produce enough organs, both Scotland and England plan to bring in an #opt out# system, meaning that on death a person#s agreement to organ donation is assumed unless they had actively opted out.Live donation is an alternative to awaiting a cadaveric organ. As people can live happily with one kidney or half a liver, family members or altruistic iniduals sometimes offer to donate these organs. Since matching donor and recipient tissue-type, however, is generally required these donations are not always acceptable.Now groups of tissue-type incompatible donor recipient pairs are getting together to mix and match, producing duos who are tissue-type-compatible. So let#s say Annie is rejected as a kidney donor for her sister Jean for incompatibility reasons, and similarly, Arthur is rejected as kidney donor for Jim. But pairing donor Annie with recipient Jim and Arthur with Jean could lead to two successful transplants. A recent report from the US describes the first ever bi-organ exchange involving a liver-kidney swap * .In this specic case a daughter wished to donate a kidney to her mother with renal failure but was rejected because she might later develop the same kidney problem. So she offered half of her liver in exchange for a kidney for her mother. Another donor was eventually identied who wanted to donate half her liver to her sister with liver failure but was rejected because her liver was too small. But she was cleared for kidney donation. So on the day of the swap four operations took place and two needy people received le-giving new organs.Although not presently being considered in the UK, with the ethical issues sorted, this multi-swap procedure opens the way for extended chains of donors and many more lives saved.*Torres et al Am J transplant. :-."},{"url":null,"title":"tarbert club on target for 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe first competition of the new year at Tarbert Gun Club also served as the January leg of the club#s winter league.A full house of  teams turned out on Sunday January , and the early shooters had to put up eith windy conditions which made the clays dance.

The existing junction in front of QMU would also be modied from a give-way ghost island T-junction to a signalised junction with greater capacity to hold turning traffic.The proposed scheme would, through the provision of an underpass beneath the A and slip roads to the northbound carriageway of the A, enable traffic movement from QMU and the new development to access the A northbound directly.Street lighting is proposed to be installed extended to include the new section of Queen Margaret Drive which would be provided under the A to the proposed roundabout junction. Street lighting would also be provided on the new slip roads.The proposals also include foot and cycle paths, two SUDS ponds, mitigation planting of native woodland to the main junction, structure tree planting, marginal planting to the proposed SUDS areas, and more ornamental planting to the areas near the QMU campus.Colin Beattie, Musselburgh MSP, said: ldquoWhile I welcome improvements to the road system which will accommodate the exciting new business developments around QMU, I am less enthusiastic about the huge expansion of housing, albeit much-needed, adjacent to QMU.ldquoThey will substantially increase the traffic on that stretch of road. Hopefully the improvements will manage that well.ldquoI continue to have concerns about developments being put in place with inadequate attention to overall infrastructure needs and the impact on surrounding residents.Barry Turner, spokesman for Musselburgh Conservation Society, added: ldquoThough we do not want this amount of housing in this location, we hope that the improved junction will channel much of the traffic generated onto the A and away from Musselburgh.ldquoThere are already serious traffic problems at the bottom end of Monktonhall Road and at the Tesco roundabout. Evenjust some of the traffic from the development around QMU comes this way to access facilities in Musselburgh, we fear the road system will clog up totally.ldquoWe have no problem with the junction improvements. Our issue is with the amount of housing proposed, which is totally inappropriate.Councillor John Williamson added: ldquoThe planned developments will technically be part of Musselburgh, although the vast majority of the new housing will be on the western side of the A with the only direct access to Musselburgh itself, as far as Irsquom aware, restricted to public transport and cycle pedestrian access.ldquoThe only full vehicle access will be via Newcraighall or Old Craighall Roundabout, which means that it will be dficult for the new communities to feel an integral part of Musselburgh.A spokesperson for QMU said: ldquoWe welcome news of the approval of planning permission for the A QMU road junction which will help unlock the full potential of the site for the development of the Innovation Park.ldquoQMU chose to move to East Lothian partly because of the opportunities to work with employers to develop the land immediately adjacent to the new campus.ldquoThe decision is the latest in a series of important milestones that have brought us a step closer to progressing plans for sustainable economic development."},{"url":null,"title":"bid-test-rocket-engines-former-cockenzie-power-station-site-rejected","story":"Skyrorarsquos bid to set up a base on where the sitersquos former coal handling plant stood had caused a ision between neighbouring community councils and saw nearly  objections lodged with East Lothian Council.And at a meeting of the local authorityrsquos planning committee last Wednesday, the proposal was rejected against the advice of council officials after planning convenor Councillor Norman Hampshire branded the development a ldquobad neighbour.Mr Hampshire told fellow committee members that he was concerned that allowing Skyrora to test rocket engines on the land, which is central to the councilrsquos future economic plans, could put other investors off.He said: ldquoThis is not a good neighbour ndash it is a bad neighbour development and my concern is this may deter potential investors from taking on development at the Cockenzie site.Skyrora had lodged an application to create a rocket engine testing site on the land, which is owned by the local authority, with plans to carry out five -second tests each month.But while it applied for temporary use of the site for five years, Skyrora told the planning committee that it envisaged the possibility of not just expanding its presence in the community but potentially bringing a manufacturing facility, described as the size of an Ikea store, to the area.And while Prestonpans Community Council supported the move as offering potential for jobs and the economy, neighbouring Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council objected.At the planning committee meeting last week, Bryan Hickman, chairman of Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council, recalled a public meeting in the summer which attracted several hundred people.He said: ldquoVirtually everyone who was there was against it ndash ranging from our youngest residents to pensioners.ldquoThe feeling, rightly or wrongly, in the community is that they do not want it.During the council meeting, residents raised concerns about the storage of key elements of fuel on the site for days prior to testing, as well as the impact of burning kerosene into the atmosphere.While Skyrora insisted that the engine tests would be a ldquoclean burn producing mainly water, resident and biochemist Dr Brian Hall told the committee that he estimated about , litres of carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide could be released during each -second test.Calum Miller, on behalf of Prestonpans Community Council, urged councillors to approve the plans, pointing out that the power station site had lain empty now for six years.He told them: ldquoThe council has the opportunity with this Skyrora application to dispel the myth that we are too remote from Edinburgh to attract business.Ward councillors Fiona OrsquoDonnell, Lachlan Bruce and Neil Gilbert did not support the application.Ms OrsquoDonnell said that the impact on local amenity would be unacceptable and spoke of the ldquohigh level of public concern from constituents about the proximity of the test site to housing ndash the nearest of which was estimated at  metres away.Councillors rejected the planning application by six votes to two.The decision was welcomed by Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council chairman Mr Hickman, who said: ldquoThe community is very pleased about the decision as expressed on social media and meeting residents as I go about.ldquoI felt that we presented a strong case against the application.ldquoThe councillors present gave a fair and balanced summary before coming to their decision. The community thanks the ward councillors who called in the application.ldquoIf this did not go before the committee, it would have been approved by East Lothian Council planning department.Brian Weddell, chairman of Prestonpans Community Council, said that he hoped the council would now turn attention to calls for a cruise port at the former power station site, which has been supported by his members. He said: ldquoI am disappointed that local ward councillors went against the advice of their council officers on this planning application.ldquoHopefully this will focus East Lothian Council councillors and officials on pushing forward the cruise port initiative to secure much-needed jobs in East Lothian.And his community council colleague Mr Miller criticised councillors for failing to listen to their officials.He said: ldquoIt was patently obvious that councillors on the planning committee couldnrsquot get their heads around the nuances of decibels and emissions.ldquoThey should have fallen back on advice from their own experienced officials. Instead, they repeated the junk science coming from cranks in Cockenzie.ldquoEach test would have generated the same emissions as a family car running for a year. The councillors who referenced a climate emergency in defence of their decision were only too happy to drive home from Haddington.ldquoAn ecosystem of space technology companies could have emerged in East Lothian based around the testbed.ldquoThe wilful ignorance of a few has pulled opportunity for the hands of young people in East Lothian.Derek Harris, from Skyrora, said he was disappointed by the decision of the planning committee.It is understood the company will take time to consider whether to appeal the decision.Mr Harris said: ldquoI would like to thank all the staff at East Lothian Council who helped with our application.

I was alone and deep in thought. I cannot remember now exactly what the issue was, but something had happened that seemed to be unfair, and it had made me angry.It was a windy and cold day. The tide was in and the waves rolling and crashing created a kind of meditative sound. I donrsquot know how long I sat there, as time seemed to dissolve as I listened to the sea, and smelt the salt air.Later I walked by the shore, again alone, and I remember how my mood had changed.My memory of that day fades at this point: I cannot recall what happened as I ed home. But clearly the sea had done its job in calming my emotional state.Memories are not like books on a shelf which we can take out and look at, and then . Our memories are really about emotions rather than happenings. We connect to the emotions first, our brain then does a search for the events associated with the emotion. Songs, smell, sounds and places can trigger emotion which then leads to associations with actual events.So itrsquos the emotion attached to events which will mark it as signicant. Thatrsquos why we remember the unusual moments more than the everyday ones. We remember the events when our emotions were aroused, either positively or negatively.That day I was angry. The sea was pretty much on our doorstep, so it was probably an obvious place to go to be alone, away from my siblings, to rage at the injustice I felt. But it was a good choice, because the sea has a powerful ability to heal.There seems to be a sense by some that the sea is a place to go only when itrsquos sunny and warm. In fact, the gts of the sea are given all year round, and it is winter time, or a time of storm and wind, that the sea becomes a powerful place to find naturersquos healing.How lucky we are to live in a county where we have  miles of coastline, much of it close to communities and accessible. Those with a sense of adventure and physical ability to do so can find parts of the coast to themselves, even in busy times.But as I learnt all those years ago, the sea can speak to us directly. Simply sitting by it, or walking along the shore while sharing our thoughts, can be a powerful form of mental as well as physical healing.Some take this a step further by bathing in the sea on a regular basis ndash yes, even in the winter. There are real benefits to swimming in a cold sea, both in terms of mental and physical health. But I think it helpsothers do it with you, as an encouragement! The Loony Dooks which take place at North Berwick, Dunbar and where around the coast should be a weekly event, not a yearly one!But we donrsquot need to be in the sea to feel its benefits, just by it and connected to it mentally, and yes, spiritually. This is a serious point. We have an epidemic of mental health issues, and while there is no one simple explanation or solution, we need to understand the signicance of our disconnection from nature and its impact on our mental health. Spending time by the sea is a tonic for body and mind.I think we felt this last week when we headed for the rocks at North Berwick on Boxing Day. It was here that Robert Louis Stevenson played as a boy and discovered a small cave in which he imagined tales of pirates and smugglers. The island of Fidra, said to be his inspiration for Treasure Island, can be seen further along the coast.The tide was in, so it wasnrsquot possible to see the cave. But in scrambling over the rocks, discovering other things and sitting by the waves, the sea did its magic for our family and myself. The waves were crashing andyou studied how they hit the rocks you could see how the hand of the sea had carved them in certain ways.We sat and explored there ndash not noticing the nippy wind ndash for a good hour. It was an overcast afternoon and darkness fell soon. But the walk along the beach to the town for a hot chocolate was the final part of the therapy!Our coastline is a gt for us and we need to use it, and respect it, more. The beaches, coves and clfs of our county are a true treasure. Try spending more time with them, listening and experiencing the sea, walking or sitting with it.I promise you, you will feel better, and have a story to tell.Happy New Year."},{"url":null,"title":"new-mcbrave-games-event-held-musselburgh","story":"The action-packed event, called McBrave Games, promises participants a uniquely Scottish experience with events such as tug orsquo war, tossing the caber, putting the shot, the hill race, weechinrsquo the welly and a Highland fling.There will also be a Scottish twist on challenges along the km obstacle course to test participants.The event takes place on Saturday, May , at Newhailes House.Participants can take on the challenge as a solo entrant or enter as a clan of four with colleagues or friends to battle it out to become the laddie or lassie of McBrave Games.Co-founders Jo Dytch and Andrew Hastings are confident the creativity and innovation behind the event will encourage entrants to try something new in .Jo and Andrew bring with them more than  yearsrsquo combined experience in the mass participation space on large-scale events such as Race for Le, Tough Mudder and the -mile Cateran Yomp.Commenting on the inspiration behind the event, Jo said: ldquoScotland is an inspiring and magical place.

This is a fascinating and picturesque structure from the th century, which lies semi-hidden amongst the trees that cling onto the steep sides of the slope.Dunglass is such a beautul area, and the ancient Dunglass Collegiate Church, dating from the th century, is one of its architectural jewels. Itrsquos open to the elements now, but well preserved and a popular place for weddings.The castle that once stood nearby is long gone. A more modern house sits on the spot where a mansion once stood, and before that the castle. Being on the main route south, the castle inevitably saw action during the ious times of war with England, being burned and damaged on a number of occasions in the s.But in August , the castle was effectively blown up in a huge explosion, and a version of events emerged which placed the blame on a vengeful servant called Edward Paris.It was a time of war and religious rage. Thomas the nd Earl of Haddington was leading a Covenanting force charged with defending this important route from the south, as the Covenanting army had entered England a few days earlier. He had established his force at Dunglass Castle, an obvious strategic location, to defend the armyrsquos rear.On that fateful day, August , , he was said to be in conversation with some fellow nobles when a huge explosion erupted from the vaults, instantly demolishing the central part of the castle which became little more than a pile of debris.Thomas and many others were killed, their bodies pulled from the rubble. They had been crushed by the collapse of the walls in the explosion.History has repeatedly recorded the names of the nobles killed on that day, but there were many others, as the castle was busy and full of people. Fty-four unnamed lsquocommon servantsrsquo were killed, and more than  other people badly injured, some later dying of their injuries.Edward Paris was Thomasrsquos servant and he has been blamed for this tragedy. The th-century writer Andrew Stevenson claimed Edward had the keys to the vault in which huge amounts of gunpowder had been stored, and he had been ldquoseduced by the enemies of the covenant to commit this act. He was an Englishman and another account says he was incensed at derogatory remarks made by Thomas about his countrymen.Irsquove always thought this explanation never really had the ring of truth. It was initially deemed an accident, and the story of Edwardrsquos role emerged later, instigated by a writer called William Lithgow, a man who had certain axes to grind. In one account, Edward is said to have thrust a hot poker into the gunpowder or set fire to it. The detail of this is suspect in itself, for who survived as a witness to this act  I suspect that a dreadful accident, possibly caused by incompetence and carelessness, was turned into a deliberate act of vengeance as it made a more useful explanation.Of course, it is very possible that Edward was offended or annoyed at things said by his master, and perhaps he mentioned this at some stage, later to be used as evidence of his guilt. But in truth, most servants will have seen or heard things which will have offended them, it was a part of their job.Imagineservants had been able to write and publish the things they had overheard and seen, what dferent historical narratives we would have!Motives for wanting to interpret the cause of the explosion in this way can be guessed at. It was a time of atrocity and massacre, with religious, political and national hatreds. Who was responsible for the dangerous stockpiling of the gunpowder in such a manner  It seems just too easy to blame a disgruntled servant. Even later, when writing up this period, religious and political loyalties influenced interpretation.If Edward Paris really did venture down to the vaults of Dunglass Castle on that fateful day, with the intention of committing suicide in order to kill his master, along with dozens of others, then he must have been infected with a deep hatred, as well as a total disregard for the lives of his fellow servants and his own.The truth is we will never know what really happened. But Edward Paris is a servant whose name we know. Countless numbers of so-called lsquocommon servantsrsquo whose lives and fates are deemed unimportant by history remain unrecorded just as the things they witnessed remain absent from our history books.Irsquove often thought it would be fascinating to meet Edwardrsquos ghost and ask him what really happened on that day.Silly idea, of course, but you never know."},{"url":null,"title":"public-exhibition-held-plans-revive-dunbars-east-beach","story":"Dunbarrsquos East Beach, which hosts the townrsquos annual Loony Dook, was once a magnet for tourists but the disappearance of its golden sands over the years due to coastal erosion has led to fewer visitors.East Lothian Council has already been given permission for the first phase of work on the beach, which it is hoped will help sandwhile also protecting the shore.A public exhibition detailing plans for a second phase of work ndash and the project overall ndash takes place in Dunbarrsquos Bleachingfield Centre on Monday afternoon.Pippa Swan, chairwoman of the townrsquos community council, explained the desire to see the beach restored to how it was previously.She said: ldquoIt has been a long-held ambition.ldquoPeople reminisce about how wonderful the beach was and there has been a lot of disappointment that it has been so rocky for so long.Dave Northcott, East Lothian Council structural engineer and project leader, visited the community council shortly before Christmas to outline the plans.Consent is already in place for the construction of a breakwater at the southern end of East Beach.Refurbishment of the existing groyne at the same end of the beach has also been approved, alongside the placement of rock armour at the toe of the seawall.

He was said to have been martyred at sea with an anchor round his neck and was therefore regarded as the patron saint of sailors. The cult of Clement spread to Scandinavia in about the th century and then to Britain.ldquoSt Clements Wells were probably named by Scandinavians living in the Tranent area.ldquoWe know they were here because of the presence of a powerful landholder of likely Scandinavian descent, Thor of Tranent, son of Swain, who is mentioned in many th-century charters. He held extensive lands in the area and granted the church of Tranent to Holyrood Abbey.Mr Hadden said: ldquoI am sure the new stone sculptures will add another piece of culture to our area when in place to the east and west sides of Wallyford alongside those we have already.ldquoThese include the mining memorial stone and coal hutches located at St Clements Housing estate just off Salters Road, the  mining stones at the Wallyford Bing, a community woodland depicting dferent mining scenes, and also the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh memorial at the west side of Wallyford.The shapes and patterns proposed relate to the themes of the wells, water, ripples, distilling, agriculture and the sense of space and open skies of the site as it is now.

I have, full disclosure, seen Cats on the stage and it was tolerable because the characters sang and danced and barely talked so it wasnt a musical of the traditional, \"Im inappropriately bursting in to song instead of finishing this sentence,\" iety.The only thing that drew me to Cats the movie was the promise of two hours of atrocious film making.Im a member of a Bad Movie Club and we thrive on this stuff.

Even the dancing cockroaches had a certain charm. Yes, at points seeing Judi Dench with a lionesque ring of long fur framing her face felt a little fever-dreamish but she pulled it off with a certain twinkling gravitas.What are the complaints  Viewers twisted their knickers over scale - in some parts the cats are as big as cutlery in other parts they fill window frames.Two women in my screening couldnt move past the fact that Jennyanydots unzips her own skin to reveal a new outfit underneath. Others have been upset that Old Deuteronomy wears a fur coat... on top of her own coat of fur.Yet more whiny babies emphasised distress that the cats had fingers.

Labour is all for multiculturalism, but finds it hard in practice, even with racial identity. As the Labour leadership candidates lined up in all their glory yesterday, I was tempted to say, as Jon Snow of Channel  News said of that Brexit march last year: ldquoIrsquove never seen so many white faces.Only Lisa Nandy can legitimately claim ethnic descent from her father. Such a visual contrast to all those United Colours of Corbyn photo ops during the election.A party which has made a religion of ersity seems set to hand the leadership to Sir Keir Starmer, a wealthy North London barrister, who looks the very image of ldquowhite male privilege that Labour supporters on Twitter love to loathe.For a party that lectures the media, business and academia on gender, the leadership is turning into an intersectional embarrassment. Labour has never had a woman leader, and doesnrsquot seem likely to get one this time. Four out of the five candidates to replace Jeremy Corbyn are female, but the straight white guy is ahead by a mile.Mind you, Mr Starmer, as he would like us to call him, has been given a free pass by some feminists on the grounds that he is the ldquohot ticket. According to commentators like Zoe Williams in the , Sir Keir bears a striking resemblance to Marc Drsquoarcy, the austere-but-sexy human rights lawyer played by Colin Firth in the Bridget Jonesrsquos Diary film franchise.In the salons of North London, this apparently makes the Labour MP less pale, male and stale, and more pale, male and phooar. Mind you, I donrsquot think his looks will set many hearts a-throbbing in the pubs and clubs of Workington and Bolsover.As Shadow Brexit Secretary, Sir Keir was largely responsible for turning Labour into the Remain Party before the General Election. He made clear he would never support even a Labour Brexit. That convinced tens of thousands of le-long Labour voters to turn to Mr Johnson on the grounds that only the Tories were listening to them.But thatrsquos all water under the bridge now. Itrsquos time to ldquomove on. Forget Brexit. After all, Labour won the argument, didnrsquot they Aware of the Islington millionaire tag, Sir Keir has been trying to burnish his working class image.

Labour should be choosing the candidate best able to lead the party to victory, on merit, rather than someone who fits a hackneyed image of proletarian virtue. Race should be irrelevant in a party that believes in equality.But of course in the Labour Party of today it so obviously does matter. Labour has been hypnotised by identity politics and sees everything through racial and gender eyeglasses. It requires of other organisations that ious minority and gender boxes are ticked. But when it comes to their own leader, well, itrsquos complicated. And when it comes to Scotland, itrsquos more complicated still.Ms Phillips is essentially standing as the only leadership candidate who speaks the language of the working class. ldquoI love the people I grew up among, she says, ldquoand I think that they can tell.

The bull is by Baillieston Lord and out of Ballieston Lydia.The Shorthorn section saw a winner from Laga farms Ltd, Evie — a December -born bull named Lagas Logan, sired by Alvie Gaius and out of Lagas Jessica.The Limousin section#s winner — the only Limousin shown on the day — was shown by J.

The bull was by the bull Bailea Caviare and out of Emslies Gondola.The judge said: #Some of the classes just had the one bull in them, so those were no problem. But the Charolais had three in the class and the winner stood out, he was exceptional. The other two were decent bulls, but just not to the same standard as the champion.

But despite the growing impact of this crisis, there has been little meaningful action from the Scottish Government.“One strand of attracting talented doctors to the region will be ensuring that our medical schools are better linked to our communities.

Orkney has the highest incidence of MS anywhere in Scotland and indeed worldwide.Commenting on the announcement, Mr McArthur said: “MS is a devastating condition that can cause serious pain and discomfort to those affected, seriously impacting upon their lives and those around them.“This decision by the Scottish Medicines Consortium to allow Ocrelizumab to be used in the treatment of early primary progressive MS is therefore excellent news. It is something I know that many constituents, as well as the MS Society, have been calling for over many month. Hopefully, it will help improve treatment and provide a signicant step forward in the fight against this debilitating condition.“Scotland is currently home to world class research that is looking into more ways that people can manage the symptoms of MS, with a view to eventually finding a cure. By sanctioning the use of Ocrelizumab, the SMC is helping encourage further breakthroughs in this research.“Meantime, organisations such as MS Society Orkney do extraordinary work to support those with MS and their families. I would encourage anyone affected by MS to contact them and find out how they can benefit from their invaluable services and support.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This arrests a long-term trend, with signicant year-on-year increases having been seen since .ldquoPrevious analysis from the OfS found evidence of unexplained increases in the rates of first class degrees at % of universities.Ms Dandridge said the watchdog is analysing the data, looking at the proportion of firsts that cannot be explained by factors such as university entry grades, or the make-up of a student body. ldquoGrade inflation risks undermining public confidence in higher education for students, graduates and employers alike.ldquoWe will continue to seek action to address these issues, both across the higher education sector as a whole and, should it be necessary, at inidual universities. This will help ensure that everyone can be confident in the value of degrees which students work so hard to achieve.Nick Hillman, director of the Higher Education Policy Institute , a university think tank, said he believes a slowing down in the rate of increase may be the result of pressure on universities from iniduals such as former universities minister Jo Johnson.ldquoAs universities award their own degrees, and despite external examination arrangements, decisions on how many top grades to award are made at an institutional level ndash but institutions cannot ignore outside interests.ldquoSo, they will control the number of firsts to some extent, he said.ldquoThere may be other reasons too, such as the removal of student number caps a few years ago meaning that more marginal students, who are less likely to get firsts, could find a place.ldquoThe higher education sector is, in effect, going through the same cycle that A-levels went through, with lots of inflation followed by a period of reflection.ldquoThat is probably good because too big an increase in top grades devalues qualications, which is not in the interests of students, universities or employers. The figures also show that almost halfof students graduated with a . last year .More female students achieved a first or . than male students.Full-time students scored a larger proportion of first and upper second class honours than those studying part-time.A spokesman for vice-chancellorsrsquo group Universities UK said: ldquoUK universities are committed to ensuring transparency, fairness and reliability in the way they award degrees, as shown by their overwhelming support for collective action to ensure that students ndash past, present and future ndash get the qualications they deserve and can take pride in their achievements.A statement of intent published last year set out the steps institutions would be taking to ensure systems for awarding degrees are transparent and fair. UUK will be reviewing progress on this, the spokesman said.ldquoIn this debate we should not overlook the evidence that students are working harder and improvements in teaching and investment in academic support and widening participation initiatives are also leading to legitimate grade improvement.copy -.

The US has since imposed ldquomaximum sanctions on Iranrsquos economy.Iran continued to abide by the agreement until last summer, when it began openly breaching some of its limits, saying it would not be bound by the dealit saw none of its promised economic benefits. General Soleimani fought heroically against ISIS, Al Nusrah, Al Qaeda et al. If it werenrsquot for his war on terror, European capitals would be in great danger now.Our final answer to his assassination will be to kick all US forces out of the region.mdash Hassan RouhaniJanuary , After the January  air strike that killed General Qassem Soleimani, the architect of Iranrsquos regional military operations, it said it would abandon all restrictions in the nuclear deal.Thus far, however, it has only modestly increased its nuclear activity. In recent months it has boosted its enrichment of uranium to .% mdash higher than the .% limit set by the agreement but far from the % enrichment it was engaged in before the deal. Uranium must be enriched to % to be used in a nuclear weapon.Britain, France and Germany have spent months trying to salvage the deal, but have not found a way to continue trading with Iran amid the tightened US sanctions. Earlier this week, they triggered a dispute mechanism in the nuclear deal to try to bring Iran back into compliance. That process could lead to the halting of international sanctions.In his speech before the bankers, Mr Rouhani acknowledged that the sanctions had caused economic pain, but said such considerations could not be separated from foreign policy and national security.He also acknowledged the steadily rising tensions with the United States.ldquoA single bullet can cause a war, and not shooting a single bullet can lead to peace, he said, adding that his administration is seeking greater security.copy -.

Let nationalists make the case for nationalism, we should make the make the argument for solidarity and internationalism.”So make that argument – where is it  This kind of comment sounds tired to anyone who has taken the scantest interest in Scottish politics at any point in the past decade. Not only does it prop up a topsy-turvy Brexiteer conception of the UK as some beguiling beacon of internationalism while in real time we can see the country floundering for a foothold post-Brexit, but it’s particularly grating in light of Scotland’s voting preference to remain within the EU, demonstrated not only at the time of the EU referendum but in subsequently voting in tranches of strongly pro-EU parliamentarians. : Labour leadership: Jess Philips says Scottish independence is ‘threat’ to working people: Why Labour MP Jess Phillips is obvious choice for next leader – Susan DalgetyAlso stale is the reductive framing of any and all support for Scottish independence as “nationalism”, while pretending “passionate” unionism is anything but an emotive appeal to patriotism and a refusal to grasp and discuss why so many Scots, including Labour members past and present, are drawn to self-governance. And yet, this is surely exactly the area where a savvier candidate might make headway, and demonstrate their understanding of the terrain. If Phillips wants to talk about other issues that matter, there’s nothing stopping her.Echo of Better TogetherWhile Philips was in Glasgow on Tuesday, reiterating her unyielding belief Scotland should remain in the UK, Johnson had just denied another Scottish independence referendum in a letter to Nicola Sturgeon. The parallel was likely unintended by the Phillips camp, but in an echo of ’s ill-advised Better Together partnership, such singing from the same song sheet only reiterates for cynical Scottish voters how close Labour’s position on independence is to that of the Tories. The tack Phillips took is less surprising with the realisation Blair McDougall is one of her advisors, as reported this week in the National, having already left Scottish Labour’s historic and staggering loss of  seats in his wake as well as Jim Murphy’s political career in tatters.With Labour trailing in the polls, and having done so for some time, Phillips is ultimately, in her advocacy for the United Kingdom, telling Scots we should endure a Tory Government until Labour can get into power – but the problem is, Scotland didn’t vote for Labour to represent them at Westminster either. The Johnson letter bluntly underscores the democratic indignity in the constitutional status quo. With support for unionism flying full mast on the same day and at the same time, Philips might as well have plugged Boris’ Big Ben bung for him too while she was here.Speaking to EnglandSo why take a hardline stance on unionism at all, when a signicant chunk of Scottish Labour voters are open to independence  It might be a signature McDougall manoeuvre, but it appears Phillips’ words aren’t really about or even for Scotland but setting herself apart from fellow candidates, Rebecca Long-Bailey and others who’ve expressed openness to the idea of another Scottish independence referendum. By comparison, they appear reasonable and supportive of democratic principles, while also having a little more insight into why Labour has fared so badly in Scotland in recent years. They personally might not desire independence, but have a base-line level of political depth in their ability to discuss it, rather than blurting discussion-blocking soundbites about ision, and it’s in that mould a more convincing candidate might build on ideas Corbyn stirred membership interest in, but sketched out too weakly in federal terms, and ultimately couldn’t deliver.Philips’ comments the week prior were that she “couldn’t understand” independence support “up there”. Clearly. We can learn something from how each candidate deals with the Scotland question – or, really, problem. There is the sense that when Phillips speaks about Scotland, she is really speaking to England, and specically to voters likely to be won over by patriotic displays. Labour’s unequivocable unionism has not been a vote winner in Scotland in recent years. Going so heavy handed on it at all while doing the Scottish press circuit seems both unnecessary and foolish.Solidarity in suffering Tory ruleBy the time she appeared on Scotland Tonight on Tuesday evening, at what would be ten-and-a-half Big Ben bongs, even Phillips seemed tired by her own argument, as reductivist as the campaign leaflets nobody has glanced twice at for years. But what even is her argument Does she have plans for how to bridge the electoral schism, and deal with the Scottish voters who’ve abandoned Labour in droves, other than by simply panning them outright when she states that she cares about kids in Birmingham and Glasgow, as through they’d leave them to starve  Does she have any more detail on this declaration of “solidarity” and what that means other than suffering the Tories together  What does she propose for Scottish industries particularly at risk of Brexit instability  Perhaps those parts haven’t been strategised yet. At the moment, it’s just put up and shut up, while Johnson bongs on.In the grit of the Brexit Bill, Scotland’s devolved powers are vulnerable to overrule by Westminster. Where’s that solidarity then, Jess  Given the history of the place, it’s saddening that the Labour Party in general have recently been reticent in standing up for Holyrood’s mandate.Scotland deserves better than to be kicked around like a political football by candidates signalling their devotion to British identity. Indeed, Scottish representatives might one day not be sent to Westminster to hear Big Ben strike the hour.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"snp msp alex neil urges holyrood to hold indyref2 without uk government approval","story":"A veteran SNP MSP has called on Holyrood to hold a second Scottish independence vote evenits fails to win approval of Westminster.Former health secretary Alex Neil insisted MSPs could press on with a consultative ballot on the issuethe Lord Advocate gave consent to such a move.But Unionist campaigners branded such a plan as “irresponsible” and claimed Scots deserved better than politicians playing “constitutional games”.:PM formally rejects indyref demand from Nicola SturgeonThe Prime Minister wrote to Nicola Sturgeon on Tuesday stating that she and her predecessor Alex Salmond had pledged the  referendum would be \"once in a generation\" event.But the SNP leader branded the Tories \"terried of Scotlands right to choose\" as she warned their opposition will not stand.Mr Neil told the Daily Record he believes the Scottish Government should seek a legal opinion on whether Holyrood could organise its own consultative referendum without the consent of Westminster.He said the SNP should consider establishing a Constitutional Convention on the specic issue of Scotland’s “right to choose”.His remarks come after Constitutional Relations Secretary Mike Russell accused the Prime Minister of ignoring the wishes of Scots voters, who in last months general election ed an increased number of SNP MPs.Speaking yesterday Mr Russell said: \"I think you can either have democracy or you can have dictatorship, you cant have both.\"If Boris Johnson wants to be a dictator that simply says other peoples votes dont matter, Scotlands doesnt matter, Scotland isnt a nation, that is a decision which cannot hold in my view, because it goes so much against the views of the people of Scotland.\"Even those who are not in favour of independence, we know are in favour of saying it is right thatthe people of Scotland vote for something they get their chance to choose.

While it is widely accepted that modernisation of air traffic control infrastructure is needed across the region, Ms Wishart says Hial’s own consultants have acknowledged that the ‘remote tower’ model was the most ‘costly’ and ‘risky’ of the options available.The Liberal Democrat MSP has now lodged a motion in parliament that will see a debate on the issue take place later this month.“It now appears clear that Hial’s management is intent on pressing ahead with their plans to centralise air traffic control services.#This is deeply worrying given the serious questions that still hang over these proposals and the level of concern amongst ATC staff.“Hial has been intent on pursuing this option from the outset, despite its own consultants identying the ‘remote tower’ model as the most costly and risky option. Since then, there has been a desperate attempt to get the evidence to fit the desired outcome.“That is simply not acceptable, particularly given the leline nature of these air services. No-one disputes the need to modernise and invest in the current infrastructure. However, this must be balanced with the safety of passengers, reliability of services and the benefits of sustaining high-skilled jobs in our island communities.“To date, the Scottish government has been happy to wave through Hial’s proposals with little evidence of robust scrutiny. I hope this debate will force the Transport Minister to think again and begin asking serious questions about these latest centralisation plans.”Highlands and Islands MSP Jamie Halcro Johnston has added his voice to calls for a debate in Parliament on HIAL’s plans to centralise air traffic control in the region.Mr Halcro Johnston, an Orkney resident and regular user of Hial services, said: “I share the concern of many people over Hial’s plans to centralise air traffic control services in Inverness.“There is real concern amongst Hial employees that they don’t feel that they have been properly consulted, particularly amongst those living in the islands. Hial should reflect on the feedback they are receiving and review their options before they commit to the approach they are advocating.“I am yet to be convinced that these proposals from Hial aren’t more about saving money than providing a better service. Given how important our vital leline air-links are, that would focusing on the wrong priority from Hial. “I would welcome the opportunity to see the issue debated at Holyrood and, with Hial entirely owned by the Scottish government, to hear the Minister’s justication for Hial’s plans.# It is understood that Hial is planning to update staff and stakeholders on the air traffic controllers issue later this week. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"energy saving campaign focuses on electric heating ","story":"This year the campaign will attempt to reach two groups of people: those who use electric heating and those who have homes that are hard to heat.As part of a national campaign the bureau will hold two community events.

Those taking part are teamed with fellow Slimmers in a bid to be crowned overall Saints  Slimmers Champions, .With health and well-being at its heart, Saints  Slimmers provides opportunities for regular team exercise, promotion of positive mental health, development of teamwork skills, dance and many social activities. Participants have been assigned to a team and are following a six week programme of activity. Those involved will be spin cycling in the early morning before winding down with a brisk walk that evening.Circuit training, aerobic workouts and the all important team challenges will keep everyone entertained, while the finale dance-off in the splendour of the Tullyglass House Hotel will provide a fitting celebration of the participants efforts.But don’t let the “Slimmers” reference mislead you. This programme is about far more than that as Club Chairman Jim Brady elaborates: “Our annual programme places its emphasis clearly on the achievement of personal goals for all involved. “For some that might be simply getting out of the house for an activity at a time of the year when the long nights and inclement weather may put you off leaving home. “For others it may be an opportunity to meet new people, to try something new or indeed … to lose some weight.“Whatever the goal, the programme seems to have captured the imagination of local people in great numbers since it started four years ago with some  people in total taking part. “As well as providing the participants with a range of activities to undertake we offer mental wellness sessions, a range of social events to attend and many opportunities to step outside of their comfort zone. “All of our fitness tutors are locally based and that means that as well as channelling funding towards them during the programme they also get a chance to show off their product and attract spin-off business as a result throughout the remainder of the year”.In  the programme was recognised at the Irish News Club  Volunteer Awards when it was awarded the prestigious award for best Club Health  Well Being initiative. This years programme sees participants range in age from  to  years of age and activities are tailored to inidual need and fitness.Charity features as an integral part of the programme and last year the organisers at All Saints designated the McMillan Unit at Antrim Area Hospital as the beneficiaries of their efforts. A sum of over poundk was raised principally through the team “Spinathon” at the Harmony Hub in the centre of Ballymena in February. This year a similar event on Saturday, February  will raise funds to benefit the Children’s Hospice.The club would like to thank those local sponsors who have supported inidual teams and events. They include Ballymena Running  Athletic Club, McKillop’s Spar Frys Road, Connolly’s Spar Dunclug, Tullyglass House Hotel and the overall programme sponsor Galgorm Resort and Spa. The theme for the teams this year are flowers and they are appropriately named as: The Teamkit Tulips, The Do-Jo Daffodils, The Doherty Meats Marigolds, The Fitzsimons Opticians Foxgloves, The Pizza Parlour Pansies, The Knockdene Healthcare Heathers, The Flamingo Forget Me Nots, The Sitting Room Snowdrops, the Studio  Sunflowers, The Steele Physio Primroses, the Prime Fitness Ponsettias and the Rafferty Property Roses.So over the next few weeksyou happen to see a group of Roses or Pansies jogging past you on the street give them a shout of encouragement and help them to bloom!

I am still weak but you can imagine what it is going to do for me when I fully recover.“I want to thank so many people, including my amazing CF team at Belfast City Hospital who pushed behind the scenes without me knowing, and the amazing staff on Level  South Transplant Ward who have become my second family. I have spent more time with them this year than my own family.“Then there is the team in ICU. What these guys do is amazing. The extra care they give to the very sick people is out of this world.“I want to thank Vertex pharmaceuticals for finally giving in, eventhey were slow on the mark and I was too close to death for them to make the bloody decision but nevertheless.“I also want to thank my amazing family and friends for being there from day one and everyone who has followed my story. I am just a normal girl from Newtownabbey who wanted to help myself and others with cystic fibrosis speak out and get the drugs we deserve.“It is proof that three little tablets saved my le.

As British citizens living in the United Kingdom, we have a complex and multi-layered identity which in many areas is wider than simply Ulster-Scots. We remain unconvinced that the cultural traditions and identity of the Orange family will be meaningfully promoted or safeguarded by these proposal.#Earlier Conradh na Gaeilge had branded the proposals an #historic advancement# for the Irish language but ones which fell #far short# of previous government commitments by the Irish and British governments.The deal includes a number of provisions for the language including the appointment of a Irish Language Commissioner.Dr Niall Comer, President of Conradh na Gaeilge, said that deal was #undoubtedly historic#, however, the organisation highlighted the absence of an Irish Language Act as promised in the  St Andrew#s Agreement. #This legislation is undoubtedly an historic advancement for our community, and for those who wish to use the language, by providing historic official status, legal protection and an Irish language Commissioner for the first time in the history of the state,# Dr Comer said.#This has only come about as the result of a tireless, inspirational and bottom up campaign which has transformed how people here now view the language and ultimately how the state will interact with our community and shared language moving forward.#Ciarán Mac Giolla Bhéin of Conradh na Gaeilge added: #This protection comes in the form of an Irish language Bill being pasted into the GFA, independent from the other language legislation, as new, separate parts of that agreement. If passed, we will hold any new power-sharing executive fully to account on the full implementation of these proposals and will tirelessly test and expose the weaknesses and glaring omissions in the coming days, weeks and months. #There are some huge question marks here. These proposals fall far short of the commitments made in the  St Andrew’s Agreement, which promised an Irish language Act based on the Welsh legislation and does not contain provisions that are made for language in Wales or in the south, as was explicitly committed to by both Governments. #The complete omission of visibility and signage is hugely frustrating and will undoubtedly be a source of tension and will expose major fault-lines on contested cases of signage in the coming period. However, the possibility of the delivery of signage through language standards will be rigorously and immediately tested by our community. #The role and remit of the commissioner being left to the sign-off of OFMDFM leaves us at the whim of a veto being used against core components of the legislation and drafting and delivery of services. The use of any veto to limit, obstruct or frustrate delivery of services and rights would undoubtedly erode trust and could be potentially catastrophic for any incoming Executive.#We welcome the adoption of recommendations included in our consultation document for the centuries long overdue repeal of the final remaining  Penal Law, that will now facilitate the use of Irish in Courts the new central translations hub the right to use Irish in the Assembly, where it was previously sneered at and belittled, which includes a provision for simultaneous translation. Finally, the commitment to an Irish language Strategy has the potential to transform our community in the coming years. #We will now work diligently towards testing the glaring gaps in the legislation that prevent us from playing a fair and equal role in our society. Legal advice is being sought on several of the provisions, including the ‘official status’ provision. The devil is not only in the detail of the legislation, but in the implementation of that legislation.#"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"o theanga leipreachain go dti acht ghaeilge","story":"I , caitheadh amach as mo chéad chruinniú den Chomhairle i mBéal Feirste mé as Gaeilge a labhairt.Nó “teanga leipreacháin” mar bhaist Sammy Wilson uirthi.Mhuscail mé inniu agus Acht Ghaeilge ar an táirseach againn.Moill ró-fhada ach d’éirigh linn mar phobal Gaeilge ó Thuaidh tabhairt ar na húdaráis an tAcht a bhí geallta ó  a ghéillstin.Tá na heilimintí tábhachtacha atá de dhíth in aon Acht ansin:Stádas oigiúil.Coimisinéir Teanga.Caighdeáin seachas scéimeanna.Agus ar ndóighe tá ríméad ar leith orm go bhfuil aistriúchán comhuaineach le bheith curtha ar fáil sa Tionól féin agus comhaltaí ag caint Gaeilge.

Mr Murphy said public services will now face a shortfall of at least £ billion next year, making them \"extremely dficult\" to fund. Read MoreFinance Minister Murphy casts doubt over DUP confidence and supply cash payoutHe accused the Government of acting in bad faith, saying they undertook to provide the additional funding needed to deliver \"ambitious\" commitments in the New Decade, New Approach deal. Meanwhile, Secretary of State Julian Smith said politicians salaries had cost £m while Stormont was out of action - and said \"lets get on with it\". \"Let’s remember MLAs have been off work  years at a cost of £m+ in salaries.,\" he said on Twitter. \"There will be a new deal for NI as it leaves the EU. There is also a UK budget in spring. £bn is biggest ever NI talks settlement  it addresses a number of key issues.\"Finance minister Murphy said his officials were in the process of fully costing what was required but that the announcement had been made against the wishes of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister.Mr Murphy said: \"The financial package claims to provide £bn. £bn of this was already coming to the Executive.\"In a statement on Wednesday, the Government said they were providing the funding to end the nurses’ pay dispute, transform public services, turbocharge infrastructure investment and address NI’s unique circumstances. They said it included a \"rapid injection\" of £ million to Executive finances, including £ million to resolve the nurses pay dispute and deliver pay parity over the next two years, as well as £ million for a medical school in Londonderry and £ million for public transport. Mr Murphy said: \"For the legacy institutions, the proposed package adds £m to the £m previously committed. This falls at least £m short of the projected cost of £-£m.\"The parties are working together to deliver quality public services for our people. This act of bad faith makes our job much more dficult.\"As Finance Minister I cannot and will not accept this and will be taking this up with the British Government.\"Julian Smith, Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, said: \"New Decade, New Approach is about putting Northern Ireland’s Assembly on a sustainable footing.\"This funding provides certainty to the Executive and ensures much-needed reforms across health, education and justice can be delivered.\"Earlier on Wednesday, Conor Murphy visited the Casement Park sports ground in West Belfast which is awaiting a long-delayed overhaul. Parts of Northern Irelands infrastructure and wider public services have suffered during the three-year devolution hiatus. Final resolution of an unprecedented nurses strike which has paralysed parts of the health service was also earlier awaiting confirmation of new funding from the UK Government. The deal which sealed theof the Northern Ireland Executive includes an intention to complete planned stadia programmes. The construction of a new stadium at Casement Park was badly delayed by safety concerns and objections from residents. A renewed business case came into Stormonts Communities Department in November. It is intended to be a centrepiece for Gaelic Athletic Associationgames in Northern Ireland. The project has an overspend of £ million, a recent Audit Office report said. Building has still not started three years after the expected completion date.SDLP leader and MP Colum Eastwood said he will be raising the matter of the \"totally deficient\" financial package in Westminster. \"The gulf between the ambition of the deal and the money on the table is substantial and will cause serious public finance dficulties for the Executive. This is not, and cannot be, the end of the matter.\"I am, however, pleased to see earmarked and ring fenced allocations for the expansion of Magee and a new addiction centre for the North West. These were priorities that I raised with the Secretary of State on behalf of the people of Derry.

With the invaluable assistance of Martin McGuinness, he brought the Provisional IRA to not only lay down its arms, but to decommission them, without ending partition.As Leo Varadkar dissolved the Dail yesterday, an emotional Adams was telling a party meeting in Dundalk he would not be seeking re-election as the Louth TD. He can take pride in utterly transforming Sinn Fein, bringing it from the far-flung margins to the centre-stage of Irish politics. He made it into a formidable electoral machine - although as he bows out, the partys fortunes do not look as bright as they did not so long ago.Please log in or register with belfasttelegraph for free access to this article.Sign InNew to Belfasttelegraph  window.gigyaIntegration  window.gigyaIntegration  gigyaIntegrationmand  gigyaIntegrationmand  gigyaIntegrationmand.push gigyaIntegrationLoginScreenSet gigyaIntegrationRegisterScreenSetAdams has said he was never \"caught up in the notions of leadership\" but you dont remain at the top of the republican movement for four decades without ruthless ambition.He first saw the electoral potential for Sinn Fein during the  hunger strike when Bobby Sands was elected MP for Fermanagh and South Tyrone.It is sometimes presented as a case of John Hume and Dublin convincing him of the merits of constitutionalism or half-dragging him along. But former senior IRA colleagues insist that he had long been set on that destination.As a former Army Council member, he may have sanctioned some of the worst atrocities of the conflict - yet without him the current peace would not be in place.Yet while McGuinness won the grudging respect even of those who despised his paramilitary past, Adams is universally disliked outside the nationalist community.As he stepped down from frontline politics, he celebrated theof power-sharing here last week. In the corridors of Stormont, where he served as an MLA for  years, there is little warmth for him beyond the Sinn Fein team. He lacked McGuinness easy charm. He always came across as too aloof and calculating. It is Adams strategising that saw him not only survive so long, but prosper. He played the long game while those around him were caught up in the day-to-day realities of the conflict.His two closest comrades back in the s had very dferent experiences. Ivor Bell was cleared two months ago of soliciting the murder of mother-of- Jean McConville. It was the end of a five-year legal battle for the -year-old who is in ill health. Former Belfast Brigade commander, the late Brendan Hughes, knew Gerry Adams intimately. A photo on his living-room wall showed two tanned, smiling young men in Long Kesh with their arms wrapped around each other - Adams and Hughes.In , two years before he died, Hughes told me: \"Gerry wasnt trusted bygrassroots and I was. He used me to up his own status. I had % faith in him. I defended him so many times when I shouldnt have.\"I never saw his agenda. He was far too shrewd, which is why he is where he is today. He was charismatic like Mick Collins but at least Mick Collins didnt just give orders, he fired shots himself. Gerry never did, not even at training camps in the South.Hughes said: \"I thought the struggle was about improving le for the community, not about certain people climbing up the ladder. It was never about glory for me. There is no glory in war, there is no glory in killing people. But for Gerry it was about using people to get glory and power. I never met anybody more .\"The IRA ceasefire, which has saved so many lives, is the former Sinn Fein presidents greatest achievement.But it is heart-breaking that what we have now - a power-sharing Executive at Stormont - was on offer in the Sunningdale Agreement in , yet Adams and other IRA leaders rejected it.In the intervening years, , people died. Brendan Hughes would lie awake at night tormented by the thought that it was all for nothing.

Not only did that help us process our own experiences, but it put us in a place where we could start helping others.\"The family were so successful in showing that resilience that then Prime Minister Tony Blair invited them to Downing Street where they were presented with an award for their achievements in overcoming adversity. \"That was a real honour for us, something were all still proud of,\" Mandy said.\"Since then weve been all over the country, giving talks and holding workshops on mental health issues.\"Weve even been to Rome where we met with the Catholic Safeguarding Board, but we always had a desire to try to give something back to the community we grew up in. Thats why three of us decided to start Compass Counselling.\"The organisation grew organically. Now we have a professional team of , but none of them pick up a regular salary.\"We are constantly hearing heartbreaking stories of people taking their own lives and we have been passionate about what we have been trying to do, but while the small donations have been incredibly welcome, the service is just not sustainable.\"We have gone out of our way to introduce ourselves to the people with the power to support our work.\"The service is there, its professional and filled with people dedicated to making a dference, but without that foundation of support, services will disappear and more and more people will slip through the net. We dont want to be in a position where were saying  only we were there to help. We have been there to help, but in six weeks time, unless things change, thats going to end.\"She added: \"The longer we all sit back and talk around the mental health problem, the more people are going to suffer.

But, no, for some the Irish language is more important.”Measures enshrining the place of the Irish language in society were central to Sinn Fein’s decision to re-enter powersharing.They include provision for translation and a commissioner to help champion the language.Stormont has already pledged an extra £ million from within existing resources in a bid to end a nurses’ strike which has paralysed the health service.Backdated rises for teachers and steps to improve the country’s creaking infrastructure could make signicant dents in the British Government’s extra cash.SDLP Leader, @columeastwood MP has said the overall financial package announced by the British Government is \"deficient\", with a substantial gulf between ambition of the Deal and monies available.Read more here: https:t.co xKeMSNxu pic yxBxhqd— SDLPJanuary , Northern Ireland Secretary Julian Smith has urged the Northern Ireland parties to get on with the process of repairing public services and defended the funding allocation.It included “a rapid injection of £ million to put the Executive’s finances on a sustainable footing”, the Northern Ireland Officesaid.That included £ million to end the nurses’ pay dispute.The Government said the package will be accompanied by “stringent” conditions contained within the Stormont deal, around accountability for public spending and the development of sustainable public services.Mr Allister said: “When the Stormont parties bulldoze on with this language nonsense and squander money needed where, then let it not be said they were not called out on their folly.”"},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland traffic alerts belfast city centre street closed for building work","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

We have a very simple saying, Happy pupils, high expectation, high achievement and thats it in a nutshell.\"The school is well led by a supportive board of governors.\"Principal of Loreto Grammar, Omagh, Grainne OHanlon, said she was \"delighted\" at its joint top ranking, the first time it has topped the league table.\"It is the result of the professional relationship and trust which the teachers establish with the pupils,\" she said. \"Theres a strong, supportive pastoral Special Educational Needs and safe environment surrounding the pupils and thats fully endorsed by the parents.\"Its the overriding belief that our young girls are creative, talented and able, and with a lot of self belief and hard work they can achieve.\"Lumen Christi College principal Siobhan McCauley said her schools academic success is largely due to \"the excellent relationships that exist between students and staff\".She added: \"The strong support of parents coupled with the hard work and dedication of the staff enables our students, who are well-motivated and enthusiastic, to perform at the highest level and thus achieve outstanding exam results.\"Principal of Rainey Endowed Mark McCullough said the results were enabled by a \"three-way partnership between the school, parents and pupils\".\"Its a great accolade - we just work and do the best for them that we can,\" he said.\"Im absolutely delighted and would like to thank everybody for all their hard work.\"Principal of St Dominics in Belfast Carol McCann said that % of all GCSE grades achieved in her school were A* A.\"Our performance at GCSE is the highest it has ever been in the A* A grades,\" she said. \"We are very proud of the achievement, which is down to the hard work of the pupils, staff and parents, who have worked together.\"Our Lady and St Patricks College principal Deborah McLaughlin said her schools joint sixth position was \"testament to the positive attitude of our students, who are supported by our committed staff and our parent body\".\"Were very much a team,\" she said. \"It is a balance between academic and extracurricular activities for students.\"Principal of St Louis Grammar School in Ballymena Sean Rafferty paid tribute to the work of pupils, staff and teachers.\"I would like to congratulate the pupils, teachers and parents for their magnicent effort.

Last week they were stunned to receive a report of a dog matching Moses description at Wood Green Animal Sanctuary. The charity at Godmanchester in Cambridge recently featured in a Channel Four series called The Dog House.As Moses boarded the overnight boat back to Belfast yesterday - this time as a fully paid passenger - the family recalled the extraordinary tale of his misadventure.Carol made the -hour-journey to Cambridge with her daughters Julie and Joan Hill overnight on Tuesday. But being reunited with Moses was not all plain sailing. \"We were made aware that a very matted poodle was found in not great condition in Godmanchester, when the girl who found him put up a post on Facebook,\" said Carol.\"This was a week ago and when we first contacted the rescue shelter they wouldnt accept that it could be our dog because he had come from Northern Ireland.\"They initially refused to let us visit and it was only on Monday that they finally agreed and we booked the next boat to Liverpool which was Tuesday night.\"During his long journey from Belfast to the south of England Moses suffered terribly.\"When rescued his coat was completely matted, he had lost some teeth and he was riddled with fleas. The rescue centre shaved his matted hair and started to nurse him back to good health.Joan said: \"I knew straight away that it was Moses and I just fell to the floor and cried. He was always a very happy, bouncy dog but he is very timid and scared. He is going to need a lot of cuddles and love.\"She added: \"It would appear that Moses was on board a shipping container and was shipped to England. If he was on this shipping container before Christmas, and we think he was, then he may have been in England for several weeks surviving on what he could.\"It is a four-hour drive from Liverpool to Godmanchester and it doesnt bear thinking about that he made that journey on foot.\""},{"url":null,"title":"irish premier calls for level playing field over brexit negotiations","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

UUK will be reviewing progress on this, the spokesman said.“In this debate we should not overlook the evidence that students are working harder and improvements in teaching and investment in academic support and widening participation initiatives are also leading to legitimate grade improvement.”"},{"url":null,"title":"uk pub numbers up for first time in more than a decade","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The US has since imposed “maximum” sanctions on Iran’s economy.Iran continued to abide by the agreement until last summer, when it began openly breaching some of its limits, saying it would not be bound by the dealit saw none of its promised economic benefits. General Soleimani fought heroically against ISIS, Al Nusrah, Al Qaeda et al. If it weren’t for his war on terror, European capitals would be in great danger now.Our final answer to his assassination will be to kick all US forces out of the region.— Hassan RouhaniJanuary , After the January  air strike that killed General Qassem Soleimani, the architect of Iran’s regional military operations, it said it would abandon all restrictions in the nuclear deal.Thus far, however, it has only modestly increased its nuclear activity. In recent months it has boosted its enrichment of uranium to .% — higher than the .% limit set by the agreement but far from the % enrichment it was engaged in before the deal. Uranium must be enriched to % to be used in a nuclear weapon.Britain, France and Germany have spent months trying to salvage the deal, but have not found a way to continue trading with Iran amid the tightened US sanctions. Earlier this week, they triggered a dispute mechanism in the nuclear deal to try to bring Iran back into compliance. That process could lead to the halting of international sanctions.In his speech before the bankers, Mr Rouhani acknowledged that the sanctions had caused economic pain, but said such considerations could not be separated from foreign policy and national security.He also acknowledged the steadily rising tensions with the United States.“A single bullet can cause a war, and not shooting a single bullet can lead to peace,” he said, adding that his administration is seeking greater security."},{"url":null,"title":"volcanos quakes and cracks send more people fleeing in philippines","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The -page document was published by Secretary of State for NI Julian Smith and Taacutenaiste Simon Coveney late on January , exactly three years on from the collapse of Stormont. All parties agreed to re-enter the Assembly the following day. It details how the Executive will benefit from increased funding for capital infrastructure investment as a result of the UK Government’s “infrastructure revolution”. Derry and the North West receives special mention throughout the document although the exact funding package has not been revealed. googletag.cmd.push Infrastructure funding will enable the Executive to invest in a range of potential capital projects, the document outlines, such as the A A roads Capital and resource funding for the Medical School in Derry, subject to the Northern Ireland Executive’s approval of the project. Commenting on the news, Ulster University said: “We welcome the commitments within the deal to the development and expansion of our Magee campus and the establishment of the graduate entry medical school. “These commitments will bring enhancements for student opportunity, health  patient care.” Foundation Dean of the proposed Medical School, Louise Dubras added: “Campaigning stops setting up starts. googletag.cmd.push “I’m so looking forward to establishing the team to deliver Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgeryand selecting the first cohort of students. Advance notice to all my medical education colleagues out there, Derry is great place to live and work, and Ulster University will be recruiting.” The Government will make funding available for a range of projects aimed at supporting community and reconciliation initiatives to remove barriers, bring the people of Northern Ireland together and build a safer, more secure society in Northern Ireland. This “could include” areas such as additional funding to support mental health over three years, funding for tackling paramilitarism, to support a new Executive in tackling deprivation and improving opportunity. Once again Derry was explicitly mentioned in terms of funding to support the “Derry addiction centre”. It’s understood that is in reference to greater investment for Northland’s Addiction Centre. Infrastructure  Concurrently, the Irish government has pledged to work with the Northern Ireland Executive and the UK Government to achieve greater connectivity on this island – by road, rail and air. “We believe this is an immediate opportunity to move forward quickly together to deliver on plans to complete key infrastructure projects including the A and the Ulster Canal connection from Clones to Upper Lough Erne. “The Government will deliver on its funding commitments to those projects, including a total of pound million up to  for the A. “The Irish Government also intends to take forward a review of the potential for Government support to renewed viable air routes from Cork to Belfast and Dublin to Derry, working with the UK Government and Northern Ireland Executive to deliver improved connections as a priority.” The Government has also recognised that the North West region is in particular need of strategic investment, and that there is a clear argument for further enhancing cross-border cooperation and connections, to the benefit of all. The Irish Government welcomed the UK Government’s announcement to invest up to poundm in Derry and the North West through the Derry and Strabane City Deal and the Inclusive Future Fund. It is committed to exploring opportunities for investment that will further support opportunities to bring greater economic prosperity and social benefits to the wider region. “In this context, the Irish Government welcomes the development of plans for ambitious new higher education provision in Derry,” the document reads. “This investment can support more access to third-level education for young people on a cross-border basis, enable further cooperation between third-level institutions in the North West including in research and innovation, and underpin broader economic development and opportunities in the region. “The Government is willing in principle to contribute to capital investment to support expanded provision at Ulster University Magee Campus, alongside the commitment made as part of this agreement by the UK Government. “We look forward to early discussion at the North South Ministerial Council on taking forward this coordinated investment in order to deliver this vital project for the North West region,” it adds.  Foyle River Gardens As part of the North West Strategic Growth Partnership the Irish government is “ready to continue discussions” on key projects for employment and sustainable development in the region, including the Foyle River Gardens – described as Northern Ireland’s Eden project, after the popular visitor attraction in Cornwall, England. The Government will also maintain the enhanced level of funding for the Reconciliation Fund at €. million per year in support of projects in Northern Ireland and border areas, with a focus on the most hard-to-reach and marginalised communities in terms of economic and social deprivation. “Ireland has consistently prioritised the continuation of EU PEACE funding including through ongoing engagement at EU level. We will continue work with our EU partners and the UK Government and Northern Ireland Executive to ensure that the PEACE PLUS programme, building on and continuing the work of both PEACE and INTERREG, will be delivered through the Special EU Programmes Body in support of reconciliation and harnessing the opportunities of our peace for all,” it concludes.

Scott was a past pupil of this weeks opponents St Louis and went on to have a stellar career with Antrim, winning an All-Ireland junior title in . In the same year, she won an Ulster Club title with Loughgiel, after transferring from her native Glenravel and as a student at UUJ, she played on all three Ashbourne winning teams. Alongside her on the sideline this weekend is current Antrim player Niacuteamh Donnelly, who worked in the PE Department at St Louis and is now in her second year teaching in Maghera. googletag.cmd.push In another sub plot Niamhs best friend Chloe Draine is one of the St Louis coaches and Niamh will be the bridesmaid at her wedding on Easter Monday. “Niamh is a great role model for the girls,” endorsed Scott, who coached  of Magheras  Senior winning teams. Scott, while jokingly not identying who is who, points to the good cop, bad cop management setup in Maghera. “I have been there since  and in the first year, we won all five titles . We are the only school ever to have done that.” In contrast St Louis hold five titles, all won in the first eight years of the competition – including a three-in-row at the turn of the s. googletag.cmd.push While there is a gulf on the roll of honour, there was precious little between the teams in the group stages. After playing second fiddle for much of the game, Maghera upped the ante to grab a - to - win, recalls Scott. “It was a very tight match and itcould go any way on Friday.” In the semi-finals, Maghera saw off St Marys Magherafelt in a monsoon at Loup before Christmas, thanks to a player of the match performance from Bronagh McCullagh, as well as goals from Aimee Lennon and Clare Gunning. On the other side of the draw, St Louis took out three in a row Ulster champions Cross and Passion Ballycastle, - to -, with their goal coming from Caoimhe Molloy, a game that Scott saw the second-half of. Maura Downey was accurate from frees but the Ballymena girls needed to dig deep. Trailing by a goal early in the second-half, they upped their game and outscored Ballycastle - to - in the final quarter to set-up Fridays showdown. Maghera continued their preparations over Christmas and had a successful training weekend in Dublin recently. An overnight stay, funded by the girls themselves, came between challenge games with Kilkenny Us and Dublins intermediate side in Abbottstown. “I have been at Maghera  years and up until recently, the last four years, I never saw a Halloween break, a Christmas break or a February break...ever,” Scott said, referencing the extra training sessions with the schools teams. “I love it and I love the girls and I wouldnt hesitate to go infor them.” There are four sets of sisters on the Maghera squad including the Niacute Lochlainnand Lennontwins. The others are Doireann and Eacuteadaoin Donnelly, Katie and Eimear Doherty. “Eimear is only a third year but she helped outwe needed extra players to play a match,” Scott pointed out. “She was that keen, we let her stay. She is going to be the new Ceaacutet McEldowney – she is excellent for all the age of her.” Scott and Donnelly, barring a long-term knee injury to goalkeeper Mairead Comer, have a full hand to pick from. They are relieved Ceaacutet and Carla McEldowney came through unscathed from Slaughtneils training camp in Kilkenny at the weekend. “Sheis a big, big miss but Eimearis doing excellent in goals. She has been doing well all year and she was superb down in the Dublin game.” The hallmark of Magheras semi-final win over Magherafelt was their midfield power. Ceaacutet McEldowney and Bronagh McCullagh are a formidable pairing, with Blathnaid McLaughlin weighing in with scores from the wing. The loss of McEldowney was felt following her switch to full-back after Aisling Porters hand injury. They will need a huge effort against St Louis pairing of Bronagh Laverty and Aoibhinn McCluskey. This is where the game will be decided. If Maghera can come out on top here, they have the attack to ask questions of St Louis. In the league game, all seven of St Louis points came from placed balls andthey cant improve on this ahead of Friday night, the Corn Uan Uladh could be Maghera bound.

John Dallats introduction to politics came quite by chance.An invitation to join a new branch of the SDLP was sent to his brother, but John went instead and almost got selected to run for council.He declined, pleading that he was living and teaching in Donegal.Four years later, after ing to Kilrea to take up a teaching post at St Paul’s College, he was chosen to run and so began a letime of council work which culminated in John becoming the first ever nationalist mayor in Coleraine.This period also represented his involvement in rejuvenating the local Credit Union which was in danger of closingA new Conference of Saint Vincent de Paulwas also being set up in Kilrea which would do amazing things for people.Around the same time, the man who was about to become one of Ulsters most hated sectarian killers, was placed by the Probation Service in the very town John lived, and worked in.Just before committing the Castlerock and Greysteel atrocities, UFF murdererTorrens Knight was placed on a local community employment scheme in Kilrea.He left without completing the year of work he was ordered to do by the courts.“The rest is, of course history,” said John. “He and his cronies murdered my friend Gerry Dalrymple, who was in my house the night before the Castlerock murder of four workmen.“His last advice to me was to pull my curtains.“The following morning, he was dead and so too were three of his workmates.“These were dark and dangerous times with armed cops sitting outside the council chamber.“In the beginning I thought they were protecting unionists but when I complained that they could be better used other places I was told by the Divisional Commander it was me they were looking after because I had no control over my mouth!“Yes, Ulster Resistance had brought in guns which were ided among the UDA and UVF and in the future innocent people would die at Castlerock, Greysteel and where.“Among those in the security forces to die was Bertie Gilmore who lived in the same lane as me.“We played together, grew up together and Bertie joined the UDR and I the SDLP. googletag.cmd.push  John Dallat ready for the road in his beloved Morris Minor car. Photo: Mary K Burke “He had retired three years and was recovering from a severe heart attack when he and his we were riddled with gunfire beside the retirement site he was going to build.“Today his daughter is among those who have helped me in challenging times.”Johnwas born and bred in Rasharkin, Co Antrim.“On reflectionI was asked to be born into a dferent house in a dferent place I would turn it down.“I was happy growing up by a Tilley Lamp, carrying water from the well and waking up in the morning with ice on the inside of the windows.“Later on I loved the ‘put-put’ of our ‘Start-o-matic’ generator and Peeke my pet pigeon was never from my side.“She had fallen out of the nest and my mother nursed her back to le while she grew the most beautul brown and white feathers.“An amazing creature of God. I knew why we couldn’t get a council house and I know it was more than just because we were Catholics. “Poor Protestants didn’t get council houses either because they might also be unable to pay the council rent.“Anyway, we kept a goat for the milk which was good for my wee brother Gerard who was special needs both physically and mentally.“He died when he was  and part of my mother and father died too.”John said that being the “underdog” was second nature to him growing up.And it was something he carried with him into his politics career.“It just seemed right and at times didn’t go down well, especially when I sided with the travellers when they came to town but the travellers were good people and attitudes changed,” he said.“When a young girl from a dferent part of the world suffered horric le-changing injuries after losing her job and was left homeless, it seemed right to have her for Christmas in our home and it was one of our best and happiest times ever.“Today she and her family are our best friends and we love them to bits.“When an African student was going to be deported because her visa ran out and her sponsor died suddenly it seemed only right to bring her home and set about stopping her going back to a country where she had only a blind grandmother and no one .“Luck had it I met the head of the Border Agency in Stormont on the corridor and he extended her stay for two years.“In the meantime, she met an amazing husband, married and is among our best friends.“Brian Kennedy played at the wedding and we dressed up in African traditional dress!There is one battle, not yet won, which has had the most impact on John in his role as a public representative.He said: “Perhaps the one story which doesn’t have a good ending just yet is the dreadful murder of Inga-Maria Hauser whose mutilated body was found in Ballypatrick Forest  days after her neck was broken in an attempted rape.“Early next year I will meet her only sister Frederika at a special conference in Queen’s University.“That will be an amazing occasion and hopefully the prelude to her murderer being brought before the courts for one of the most brutal killings I have ever read about.”At the heart of it all has been one thing, John’s family.“Politics had its mixed blessings. I got to see places in the world that I could never have been but it also brought its problems – searching under the car for booby traps, bullet-proof windows and doors and a gun that I know I would never have used.“But politics also gave me the most incredible family.“My poor we Anne was parachuted into the north at the height of the Troubles to a small town which was bombed from one end to the other.“Our daughter, Helena, now a councillor, became the youngest detainee when we were arrested by the British army in Derry shortly after crossing the border.“She was ten days old and our mission was simply showing her off to her Donegal grandparents.“Sixteen years later as a member of the Foyle Harp School she played for President Bill Clinton when he first made that history-making appearance in Mackey’s Foundry.“Later, she would entertain other leaders including President Robinson and McAleese as well as John Major and member of the Royal Family.“I felt honoured when she was invited to play in the Russian Embassy in Washington on Saint Patrick’s Day.“Today the same harp is never out of sight but not played in public anymore.”John added: “Our two sons, Ronan and Diarmuid have been amazing and in one dficult and dangerous year we were on the Aran Islands three times for our safety.“For  years Inishmore, the largest of the three Aran Islands has been our refuge, our safety valve and our friend.“Two weeks ago when I was in hospital after breaking my arm while canvassing, Vincent Mc Carron, one of our friends, left the island during a storm, drove to Kilrea to collect Anne, go to Derry to collect me from hospital and bring me home. He stayed for several days helping with my recovery.”In , one week after his mother sadly passed away, John became Deputy Speaker, a post he held for ten years.“I found it a strange place and certainly not reflecting my background where the term ’Mister’ was hardly order of the day.“In time I persuaded the doorkeepers and others to call me by my first name and I felt comfortable about that.“I felt I was dismantling a bit of the old Stormont that was in danger of being rejuvenated!“All these people were my friends by simply showing them a bit of respect, nothing more and I have missed them dearly over the last three years when I see little of them anymore.”Reflecting on challenges and achievements in his political career, Mr Dallat spoke about stopping the closure or the Belfast-Derry railway north of Ballymena.”The twenty-year project nearly went off the rails several times,” he said.“The Civil Service had a plan to save money by closing the railway north of Ballymena and use the savings to make a start on the A roadway though Toome.“Today the Belfast-Derry railway carries many more passengers than the Belfast-Dublin Enterprise service, but still needs connected to the Irish Rail network and that is a priority for me.John added: “Stopping the closure of the Irish Coastguard Radio Station at Malin Head, announced by Leo Varadkar when he was Minister for Transport.“I gave evidence to a Dail committee with two of my councillors and told the TD’s this was one of the best examples of cross-border bodies, seamless, transcending partition and two world wars, costing very little and actually working! Varadkar had to back down.”As vice-chair of the Public Accounts Committee I exposed wanton waste of public money and brought about important changes which the civil service didn’t like.“Effort to cover up who was responsible for bad mistakes and neglect were strenuously resisted.“Later I was invited to Georgia and Armenia to share my experiences and I felt so honoured and privileged.“I just couldn’t believe that a boy that grew up in a house with no electricity, no running water could be involved in helping democracy grow in two of Russia’s former territories.”With the Assembly back up and running, John says he has great hope for the future.“I have been through the best and the worst of times and see an amazing future for this part of Ireland.“I see wonderful people all around me in both communities and I want to be part of that community for the sake of future generations that will create a new Ireland and one we can all celebrate.“I would encourage every young person to do likewise.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

John Dallats introduction to politics came quite by chance.An invitation to join a new branch of the SDLP was sent to his brother, but John went instead and almost got selected to run for council.He declined, pleading that he was living and teaching in Donegal.Four years later, after ing to Kilrea to take up a teaching post at St Paul’s College, he was chosen to run and so began a letime of council work which culminated in John becoming the first ever nationalist mayor in Coleraine.This period also represented his involvement in rejuvenating the local Credit Union which was in danger of closingA new Conference of Saint Vincent de Paulwas also being set up in Kilrea which would do amazing things for people.Around the same time, the man who was about to become one of Ulsters most hated sectarian killers, was placed by the Probation Service in the very town John lived, and worked in.Just before committing the Castlerock and Greysteel atrocities, UFF murdererTorrens Knight was placed on a local community employment scheme in Kilrea.He left without completing the year of work he was ordered to do by the courts.“The rest is, of course history,” said John. “He and his cronies murdered my friend Gerry Dalrymple, who was in my house the night before the Castlerock murder of four workmen.“His last advice to me was to pull my curtains.“The following morning, he was dead and so too were three of his workmates.“These were dark and dangerous times with armed cops sitting outside the council chamber.“In the beginning I thought they were protecting unionists but when I complained that they could be better used other places I was told by the Divisional Commander it was me they were looking after because I had no control over my mouth!“Yes, Ulster Resistance had brought in guns which were ided among the UDA and UVF and in the future innocent people would die at Castlerock, Greysteel and where.“Among those in the security forces to die was Bertie Gilmore who lived in the same lane as me.“We played together, grew up together and Bertie joined the UDR and I the SDLP. googletag.cmd.push  John Dallat ready for the road in his beloved Morris Minor car. Photo: Mary K Burke “He had retired three years and was recovering from a severe heart attack when he and his we were riddled with gunfire beside the retirement site he was going to build.“Today his daughter is among those who have helped me in challenging times.”Johnwas born and bred in Rasharkin, Co Antrim.“On reflectionI was asked to be born into a dferent house in a dferent place I would turn it down.“I was happy growing up by a Tilley Lamp, carrying water from the well and waking up in the morning with ice on the inside of the windows.“Later on I loved the ‘put-put’ of our ‘Start-o-matic’ generator and Peeke my pet pigeon was never from my side.“She had fallen out of the nest and my mother nursed her back to le while she grew the most beautul brown and white feathers.“An amazing creature of God. I knew why we couldn’t get a council house and I know it was more than just because we were Catholics. “Poor Protestants didn’t get council houses either because they might also be unable to pay the council rent.“Anyway, we kept a goat for the milk which was good for my wee brother Gerard who was special needs both physically and mentally.“He died when he was  and part of my mother and father died too.”John said that being the “underdog” was second nature to him growing up.And it was something he carried with him into his politics career.“It just seemed right and at times didn’t go down well, especially when I sided with the travellers when they came to town but the travellers were good people and attitudes changed,” he said.“When a young girl from a dferent part of the world suffered horric le-changing injuries after losing her job and was left homeless, it seemed right to have her for Christmas in our home and it was one of our best and happiest times ever.“Today she and her family are our best friends and we love them to bits.“When an African student was going to be deported because her visa ran out and her sponsor died suddenly it seemed only right to bring her home and set about stopping her going back to a country where she had only a blind grandmother and no one .“Luck had it I met the head of the Border Agency in Stormont on the corridor and he extended her stay for two years.“In the meantime, she met an amazing husband, married and is among our best friends.“Brian Kennedy played at the wedding and we dressed up in African traditional dress!There is one battle, not yet won, which has had the most impact on John in his role as a public representative.He said: “Perhaps the one story which doesn’t have a good ending just yet is the dreadful murder of Inga-Maria Hauser whose mutilated body was found in Ballypatrick Forest  days after her neck was broken in an attempted rape.“Early next year I will meet her only sister Frederika at a special conference in Queen’s University.“That will be an amazing occasion and hopefully the prelude to her murderer being brought before the courts for one of the most brutal killings I have ever read about.”At the heart of it all has been one thing, John’s family.“Politics had its mixed blessings. I got to see places in the world that I could never have been but it also brought its problems – searching under the car for booby traps, bullet-proof windows and doors and a gun that I know I would never have used.“But politics also gave me the most incredible family.“My poor we Anne was parachuted into the north at the height of the Troubles to a small town which was bombed from one end to the other.“Our daughter, Helena, now a councillor, became the youngest detainee when we were arrested by the British army in Derry shortly after crossing the border.“She was ten days old and our mission was simply showing her off to her Donegal grandparents.“Sixteen years later as a member of the Foyle Harp School she played for President Bill Clinton when he first made that history-making appearance in Mackey’s Foundry.“Later, she would entertain other leaders including President Robinson and McAleese as well as John Major and member of the Royal Family.“I felt honoured when she was invited to play in the Russian Embassy in Washington on Saint Patrick’s Day.“Today the same harp is never out of sight but not played in public anymore.”John added: “Our two sons, Ronan and Diarmuid have been amazing and in one dficult and dangerous year we were on the Aran Islands three times for our safety.“For  years Inishmore, the largest of the three Aran Islands has been our refuge, our safety valve and our friend.“Two weeks ago when I was in hospital after breaking my arm while canvassing, Vincent Mc Carron, one of our friends, left the island during a storm, drove to Kilrea to collect Anne, go to Derry to collect me from hospital and bring me home. He stayed for several days helping with my recovery.”In , one week after his mother sadly passed away, John became Deputy Speaker, a post he held for ten years.“I found it a strange place and certainly not reflecting my background where the term ’Mister’ was hardly order of the day.“In time I persuaded the doorkeepers and others to call me by my first name and I felt comfortable about that.“I felt I was dismantling a bit of the old Stormont that was in danger of being rejuvenated!“All these people were my friends by simply showing them a bit of respect, nothing more and I have missed them dearly over the last three years when I see little of them anymore.”Reflecting on challenges and achievements in his political career, Mr Dallat spoke about stopping the closure or the Belfast-Derry railway north of Ballymena.”The twenty-year project nearly went off the rails several times,” he said.“The Civil Service had a plan to save money by closing the railway north of Ballymena and use the savings to make a start on the A roadway though Toome.“Today the Belfast-Derry railway carries many more passengers than the Belfast-Dublin Enterprise service, but still needs connected to the Irish Rail network and that is a priority for me.John added: “Stopping the closure of the Irish Coastguard Radio Station at Malin Head, announced by Leo Varadkar when he was Minister for Transport.“I gave evidence to a Dail committee with two of my councillors and told the TD’s this was one of the best examples of cross-border bodies, seamless, transcending partition and two world wars, costing very little and actually working! Varadkar had to back down.”As vice-chair of the Public Accounts Committee I exposed wanton waste of public money and brought about important changes which the civil service didn’t like.“Effort to cover up who was responsible for bad mistakes and neglect were strenuously resisted.“Later I was invited to Georgia and Armenia to share my experiences and I felt so honoured and privileged.“I just couldn’t believe that a boy that grew up in a house with no electricity, no running water could be involved in helping democracy grow in two of Russia’s former territories.”With the Assembly back up and running, John says he has great hope for the future.“I have been through the best and the worst of times and see an amazing future for this part of Ireland.“I see wonderful people all around me in both communities and I want to be part of that community for the sake of future generations that will create a new Ireland and one we can all celebrate.“I would encourage every young person to do likewise.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Nurses and health care workers have been stagingindustrial action in protest against pay and staffing levels which they say are unsafe.On Tuesday, Mr Swann announced a plan in the Northern Ireland Assembly chamber to add an extra pound million to previous available funding to bring wages for health care workers here up to the same level as England, Scotland and Wales.On the issue of staffing, he said safe staffing would not be achievable immediately but that he would work with his staff to draw up a workable plan.Healthcare unions, the RCN Sinn Feacutein health spokesperson on Derry City and Strabane District Council, Councillor Sandra Duffy, has welcomed Mr Swanns plans.“I am delighted that health and social care workers in the North will achieve pay parity.Health workers are the backbone of our health and social care system.“People working at all levels of the health service consistently deliver high-quality and compas- sionate care in extremely dficult situations.Councillor Duffy said she supported the health workers strike action.“It is unfortunate that over recent months our health workers have been left with no option but to strike and I commend the work of trade unions who have stood up for pay justice for HSC workers and safe staffing levels.“I also welcome the commitment from the Health Minister to produce a costed implementation plan for safe staffing levels in the near future.This must be done in close co-operation with the health trade unions.“There is an onus on the British Government to deliver upon their commitment to provide the necessary finances.”She concluded: “Sinn Feacutein will continue to support our health staff in the time ahead and hold the Minister and the Department of Health to account to ensure these commitments are lived up to.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Candystripes travel to Drogheda United tomorrow for their first pre-season friendly game, before hosting Finn Harps at the Brandywell, next Wednesday, January . Declan Devines team then host Institute on Tuesday, January  before facing Portadown at the Brandywell on Friday, January , just two weeks before the new season opener at Dundalk. Given what hes experienced in the past fortnight, Clford has no doubt that he and the players will be ready when the time comes.“Every pre-season is tough,” he admitted. “Ive done a right few in my career but this one has been right up there with the toughest Ive done. I was training hard in the off-season and preparing myself but its been really tough. “We have been in nearly two weeks now and every day theres been double and treble sessions and weve been flat out doing dferent things. We did something there in the swimming pool the other day and Ive never done anything like it. You feel great after its over and done with but its really tough.”The games are now set to come thick and fast as City prepare to visit the champions on the opening day of the  League of Ireland season, and Clford agrees that hard work now could pay idends at Oriel Park on February . “Doing all the running is one thing but the best part is when the matches come because thats what you want to be doing,” he stated. “You cant wait to get out and play so were all looking forward to the games coming now. “Its going to come quickly now. “Theres only six or seven weeks of hard pre-season training then the games come thick and fast. We start the season at Dundalk and its going to be a great occasion.” googletag.cmd.push Eager to impressClford is eager to impress at his new club, and having left St. Patricks Athletic after  months at Inchicore, the former Cha youngster is hoping to establish himself at the Brandywell. “I felt that last year was a good season for me because I played in every game and scored four or five goals and played and scored in Europe,” he explained. “The change of manager and the finances was out of my control but then I came here. “Derry showed an interest and they are a massive club in Ireland and I think we can really do well this year. Europe is something to look forward to as well. Im hoping that I can have a good season, Im in good nick at the minute and theres a few weeks to go and Im raring to go and I cant wait to get started.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Now, she says she is a dferent person.ldquoI did not set out to go on this journey or write this book, but simply started to follow an artistic thread like many artists over the centuries before me, she remarked. ldquoThe thread became so compelling and extraordinary that I eventually felt destined to write it down.Born in Newtownards in  to Frances and Paddy Lawson, who had ed to Belfast to oversee the design and building of the Ulster Museum, Bronagh spent her first two years on the Upper Newtownards Road in Belfast with her three older sisters, before moving to Portaferry in  and later to Strangford.Educated at Down High School, in  she attended art college in Bristol and then gained a first class degree in textiles fashion at Winchester School of Art, Hampshire. Moving to London on graduation, she won a Fulbright scholarship and attended Parsons School of Design in New York.Bronagh sometimes visited Northern Ireland and despaired. Prior to the end of the Troubles she spent time as a participant on ious cross-community development programmes before deciding to use her creativity in a dferent way.For  years she set up and ran cross-border, cross-community development programmes mostly within the enterprise sector in interfaceareas of Belfast.

Walking into work one day she collapsed. She had become incapable of processing the traumas that people living in some of most deprived areas of Europe were enduring on a daily basis.She found herself coming back to her original training as an artist and started a journey towards her own healing by going to church.Bronagh says she asked herself a lot of questions as she attended Protestant and Catholic services in Belfast and beyond.She says: ldquoWhatinstead of listening to the continuous repeated stories of Protestant vs Catholic in Belfast, an inidual had first-hand experience of visiting every church in the city for a service, simply looking and listening when going to each one ldquoWhat would they see and hear  As a non-church goer starting out on this journey, how would you feel ten years later  What is going on in churches in contemporary Belfast  How might this open-minded curiosity inform the continuous shting conversation about the city that I call home Belfast: City of Light costs pound and is available online at lulu.

While pay parity and safe services are key issues for us, the key thing is that there are enough recurrent resources in place to deliver this now and in the future.Irene said the RCN is about putting patients first, describing the scale of the hospital waiting list issue as ldquounacceptable.She added: ldquoEmploying more nurses can help bring waiting lists down. This is not a new phenomena. It is tough to work as a nurse and it is not an easy job. But we currently have a situation where some nurses are taking on extra shts to earn more money, but that is just an unacceptable way to live.Alison Megarry said patients are nursesrsquo primary concern and at the heart of what they do, highlighting the need to keep staff working in Northern Ireland to ensure they donrsquot go across the water and donrsquot come back.She revealed that she was talking to a nursing sister last week who was working on international recruitment for nurses in Mumbai to work in Northern Ireland.ldquoThe nurses in India said why would they come here when the pay is less than it is in England, Scotland and Wales. I believe thatwe can keep our nurses here, it will help to tackle the waiting list issue, she said. ldquoThe big issue we have is that the population is ageing and people are living longer which therefore impacts on waiting lists.Nurse Sonia McCoubrey said that while pay parity is one issue, additional nurses are also required. She said many newly qualied nurses are choosing to go to England, Scotland or Wales because the money is better.She also said she worries about the safety of newly qualied nurses managing dficult situations and the patients they are caring for.ldquoYou have trolley waits and people lying in corridors. There is no privacy, no dignity and the situation is appalling. You go home at night after a sht burnt out and worried about what you have seen, the nurse added.Nurse Donna Boyd also expressed concern about waiting lists and said she fears that the situation is going to get worse, forcing many people to go private.ldquoIf more money is put into the system nurses are quite happy to do even more to help reduce waiting lists. All nurses go and above what is required of them when they are working, often staying after their scheduled quitting time which is unpaid work, she said.ldquoWith more people going private because of y waiting lists, a lot of the doctors and consultants are taking on private lists which then impacts on the NHS list. I have friends who were nurses who have left the profession to work in supermarkets because they have burnt themselves out. They canrsquot cope with the demands being made on them, she added..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/15th January 2020 Now.jpg","title":"Now is the time for delivery – McGrath  ","story":"THE restoration of the Assembly and Northern Ireland Executive should herald delivery for people at the start of a new decade, according to South Down SDLP MLA Colin McGrath.Mr McGrath was able to take his seat in the Assembly chamber for the first time in three years last Saturday, an occasion which he described as a ldquomomentous day for Northern Ireland and its future.He said that with so many issues staring people in the face including Brexit, y hospital waiting times, workersrsquo rights and wages, welfare issues and an education system in crisis, Northern Ireland needed a restored and fully ing Assembly and Executive to deal with these mammoth issues.The Assemblyman described his partyrsquos decision to re-enter the Executive as an act of ldquotrust and goodwill.He continued: ldquoWe all know the reasons why the last Executive failed and these have been well covered.

Across the resort,  street lights are not working.The figures are available on the NI Direct website under the reporting fault problems menu with other districthot-spots including Ballynahinch where  street lights are currently out of order.Elsewhere,  faults have been reported in Killyleagh, with  brought to the government departmentrsquos attention in Castlewellan and Crossgar. In Saintfield,  faults have been reported.In Ballygowan,  street lights are currently out of order with  and  faults reported in Ardglass and Killough respectively.Sixteen street lights are out of order in Dundrum with  faults reported in Drumaness. The figures for the Spa and Clough are  and nine respectively.Last month, the Department for Infrastructure confirmed that its current budget for street lighting repairs was approximately poundm, explaining that the figure was much lower than the pound.m needed to provide a full street lighting repair service.It also revealed that repairs are now generally limited to those that can be carried out by the departmentrsquos internal street lighting workforce which only consists of five full and three part time electricians.Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran described the number of reported street light faults across large parts of East Down as ldquoalarming and hopes that the money to expedite much-needed repairs will be earmarked by the new Stormont Executive.He said broken street lights in many areas represent a health and safety issue, explaining that an examination of every town and village across the district will reveal a signicant number of faults.Cllr Curran described faulty street lights as a ldquohot topic with politicians being contacted about the issue on all almost daily basis. He said the legacy of underfunding the roads department has experienced is now clear for all to see.The politician said many will be concerned that the Department for Infrastructure does not have the money it requires to carry out much-needed repairs.ldquoWhile I understand the decision to prioritise emergency repairs, there is no doubt that the alarming figure of almost  faulty street lights across East Down is simply going to increase. Clearly the issue is going to get a lot worse before it gets better, he said.ldquoStreet lights which are not working in areas where elderly people and indeed young families live poses a major problem. A fully working street lighting system provides residents with a sense of security and helps deter would-be criminals.Cllr Curran said that while the new Stormont Executive will inevitably face calls for investment in many key areas including health and education, the Department of Infrastructure also required an injection of funding.He added: ldquoWhile the focus for some will be on major new roads schemes which is understandable, it is clear that the creaking infrastructure the government department is responsible for, including street lighting, requires major cash injection.ldquoThe street lighting issues requires immediate attention.

The sides were still locked after extra-time and at the end of five penalties apiece when James McClean drilled Olympic - ahead.It was then left to Walsh to break the deadlock when he kept out Ruairi Fitzpatrickrsquos well-struck spot kick to seal victory before he was mobbed by his delighted team-mates.Rathfriland certainly looked the part early doors as they sprayed the ball to both flanks where Fitzpatrick and Thomas Lockhart took full advantage.Fitzpatrick, in particular, ran at Dalton Tate at every opportunity, but Rathfriland failed to take advantage of his wing trickery.The first real shot in anger came in the th minute when Olympicrsquos Anton McGrattan tested Parr, but the big custodian saved with ease.Five minutes later at the other end Dalton Tate produced a telling tackle on the edge of the six yard box to deny Fitzpatrick a certain goal.However, from the resulting corner, Stephen Hughes bundled the ball over the line when Lockhartrsquos delivery caused mayhem.Rathfriland continued to play the ball methodically through the middle where Andy Kilmartin and Hughes were dominant and with  minutes gone they teamed up with Fitzpatrick to carve out another opening for Harry Campbell, but he shot straight at Walsh.Ruairi Cunningham then created an opening for Fitzpatrick, but he was way off target as was Lockhart in the th minute. A minute later at the opposite end Jason Noade got on the end of a McGrattan corner, but headed over.It looked asRathfriland were going to take their - lead into the break as the game entered the th minute and good value they were for their lead.However, with  minutes gone Stefan Mason exploded into le. The rangy striker took on two Rathfriland defenders after picking up a long ball out of defence.He headed down the left flank and looked destined for the by-line, but stopped in his tracks, checked back, turned his markers and curled a lsquoworldyrsquo into the top corner of the net, giving Parr no chance.Two minutes later it was - Olympic and again Mason was involved. When his attempted cross was blocked, McGrattan headed the ball into Nathan Jonesrsquo path.Nothing looked on when Jones got the ball centrally, just inside the box, but he managed to get the ball from under his feet and beat Parr all ends up with a stunning finish and turn the game on its head.The second half was every bit as competitive, but Olympic seemed to have the measure of Rathfriland and were playing well within themselves until Peter Telford was given the freedom of the box and allowed to head in a Lockhart free kick to make it - in the rd minute.Jason Noade then headed a Jones free kick at lsquokeeper Parr and with  minutes played the busy McGrattan fired over after a nice build-up.Another searing run and cross from Fitzpatrick begged to be put away, but Rathfriland lacked a fox in the box and the chance was gone.Chances continued to be created at either end and with the respective lsquokeepers earning their corn with brilliant saves.However, the game was in the nd minute when Walsh came to Olympicrsquos rescue when he somehow kept out an effort from Marty Havern when the former Glenavon striker seemed certain to win the game for Rathfriland. Two periods of extra-time came and went before the dreaded penalty shoot-out took centre stage.Jones, Stevie and Jason Noade, McGrattan, Tate and James McClean netted for Olympic with Kilmartin, Johnny Roy, Nigel Prentice, Ruari Cunningham and Daryll Evans replying for Rathfriland before Walsh saved the day when he beat away Fitzpatrickrsquos penalty.Ballynahinch Olympic: Ryan Walsh, Dalton Tate, Paul Dickson, Jason Noade, Anton McGrattan, Nathan Jones, Stevie Noade, Chris McNamara, Stefan Mason, Conor Reid, Ryan Molloy.

It is intended to roll out this replacement column by replacing the previously installed steel columns along Cwrt y Vil Road before the end of this calendar year.\"Penarth Civic Society alleged the posts were safe in a letter sent last week to the Vale councilrsquos head of visible services and council leader Neil Moore.David Noble of the Penarth Civic Society said: ldquoWe would like to ask that the programme of removal and replacement of Victorian lampposts in Penarth is suspended with immediate effect.ldquoWe are completely in favour of the councilrsquos policy to replace old inefficient street lighting with modern more energy efficient LED lighting units. However, we are firmly of the opinion that not enough effort has gone into the decision.ldquoIt seems that the council is spending over pound, on replacing each lamppost. When two posts in Kymin Terrace and Beach Lane were converted, the contractor expressed concern that the spigot on the column was not strong enough to support the new unit. We believe this remains the sole justication for the claim the units are unsound.ldquoWe have been in contact with several street lighting contractors. They have all confirmed as long as the posts are structurally sound at their base there is no reason they cannot be upgraded.ldquoWe feel the decision to scrap the old columns was taken prematurely, without proper consideration and is motivated by a desire for expedience rather than sensibility and care.A Vale council spokesman said: ldquoThe council has a duty to ensure that the street lighting is in a safe condition and does not pose a hazard to the general public. As a result, a number of the older Victorian lampposts in Penarth were recently replaced because they were considered electrically and structurally unsafe with holes evident in some columns. Given the many safety concerns with these old columns it was not practical or cost-effective to attempt repairs and maintain appropriate level of public safety.ldquoThe council is confident the new replacement columns will address many of the concerns previously raised and enable the remaining unsafe Victorian cast iron columns throughout Penarth to be sympathetically replaced in , preserving the character and nature of the roads and streets which currently benefit from the visual appearance of the old Victorina cast iron columns.ldquoWhile the new replacement columns with embellishments and swan neck are more expensive than standard columns the cost will be offset by conversion to LED lanterns with signicant environment benefits as they produce less Co and will be more economical to operate over the letime of the new units. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This year, she will celebrate her ninety second birthday and she discusses a letime of activism across Europe.Veganuary is an annual event which encourages people to go vegan for a month. In last yearrsquos campaign, a quarter of a million people pledged to try a vegan diet.More NewsVale school pals brave the shave for animal charityPenarth father of four is recognised in New Year Honour list for services to cricketHouse prices increased in the Vale of Glamorgan, latest figures showOnce a fringe movement, veganism is quickly gaining a vast appeal, especially amongst the young, as the environmental benefits of a plant-based diet become clearer.According to a study by the Vegan Society, , people in the UK were vegan in  ndash  and a half times higher than in . Almost half of these were people aged below .Veganism has brought with it a lucrative trade in plant-based produce as businesses move to accommodate the concerns of their customers and promote ethical alternatives to meat.Long before veganism became a dietary and commercial trendsetter, however, June Holder, a -year-old woman from Penarth, had her eyes opened to the costly effects of meat consumption. After eating a vegan breakfast at a local cafeacute, she settled down to tell me her story.ldquoIrsquove been vegan for  years, she said. ldquoMy daughter had a stall at Camden Market, and she used to collect masses of money for animal rights there. It was her who first introduced me to the cause.ldquoLater on, I organized a charity coffee morning and sent the money I raised to Compassion in World Farming. In , they sent me a magazine which showed what happened to the animals. Well, I sat down that morning and read what theyrsquod sent me ndash and I was vegan!Whilst the public has become more receptive to veganism, June still encounters hostility: ldquoPeoplersquos reactions y when I tell them Irsquom vegan. They become hostile because theyrsquore guilty, I suppose.ldquoI remember that a vegan group had a stall in the market a few years ago. They were advertising parts of Alsatians to eat. People were horried. So, when they were angry, I had a chance to talk to them. lsquoYou accept that any animal can be treated like this except when it comes to your dogsrsquo, I told them. Well, they had to accept it. How could they not Originally from Penarth, June moved to Dinas Powys from Barry after her husband, Derrick, passed away  years ago.Derrick was the owner of Holders Menswear, a menrsquos fashion store which was once renowned throughout the Vale of Glamorgan and beyond.Junersquos decision to become vegan sparked  years of dedication to activism. She joined the Animal Welfare Party, and, in her sixties and seventies, she travelled across the UK and Europe to campaign for animal rights.ldquoI demonstrated in many places. I went to Brussels twice to protest against the exportation of live animals. The International Fund for Animal Welfare took us in a coach.ldquoI was in the front row of the crowd, up against these spikes and razor wire. If they had started to push from the back, I dread to think what would have happened.ldquoThe night before the protest I had this thought: lsquoThe danger is not to protestrsquo. I wrote it on a little board.ldquoPeople kept tapping me on the shoulder and passing the board around the crowd and eventually it made its way back to me.What does the message mean ldquoIt means that it is more dangerous not to protest against these injustices that are happening.June still has a copy of the placard. Later, at her home, she retrieved it from a trove of scattered paraphernalia accumulated after years of protest.She has written prolically throughout her le about events which have provoked and enthused her. One poem describes the day of protest in Brussels. It reflects Junersquos unceasing dedication to animal welfare but also her frustration at the pace of change:ldquoThe writer of these verses was, quite some time ago, in Brussels with a poster which now rings yet more true. lsquoThe danger is not to protestrsquo is what the message said.ldquoThen round it went to young and old for everyone to read. From countries all round Europe, but the farmers paid no heed. Live transport, a huge issue then, continues just the same.Another poem read:ldquoChristmas is a time to spend, but why not save instead  In sheds around the country to sate the publicrsquos lust for something huge to set their feast. The turkeys just exist.ldquoTen million in this country at Christmas time alone. Is this the way to talk of peace and teach our children love Veganuary runs throughout January.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were.

But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This arrests a long-term trend, with signicant year-on-year increases having been seen since .ldquoPrevious analysis from the OfS found evidence of unexplained increases in the rates of first class degrees at % of universities.Ms Dandridge said the watchdog is analysing the data, looking at the proportion of firsts that cannot be explained by factors such as university entry grades, or the make-up of a student body. ldquoGrade inflation risks undermining public confidence in higher education for students, graduates and employers alike.ldquoWe will continue to seek action to address these issues, both across the higher education sector as a whole and, should it be necessary, at inidual universities. This will help ensure that everyone can be confident in the value of degrees which students work so hard to achieve.Nick Hillman, director of the Higher Education Policy Institute , a university think tank, said he believes a slowing down in the rate of increase may be the result of pressure on universities from iniduals such as former universities minister Jo Johnson.ldquoAs universities award their own degrees, and despite external examination arrangements, decisions on how many top grades to award are made at an institutional level ndash but institutions cannot ignore outside interests.ldquoSo, they will control the number of firsts to some extent, he said.ldquoThere may be other reasons too, such as the removal of student number caps a few years ago meaning that more marginal students, who are less likely to get firsts, could find a place.ldquoThe higher education sector is, in effect, going through the same cycle that A-levels went through, with lots of inflation followed by a period of reflection.ldquoThat is probably good because too big an increase in top grades devalues qualications, which is not in the interests of students, universities or employers. The figures also show that almost halfof students graduated with a . last year .More female students achieved a first or . than male students.Full-time students scored a larger proportion of first and upper second class honours than those studying part-time.A spokesman for vice-chancellorsrsquo group Universities UK said: ldquoUK universities are committed to ensuring transparency, fairness and reliability in the way they award degrees, as shown by their overwhelming support for collective action to ensure that students ndash past, present and future ndash get the qualications they deserve and can take pride in their achievements.A statement of intent published last year set out the steps institutions would be taking to ensure systems for awarding degrees are transparent and fair.

The US has since imposed ldquomaximum sanctions on Iranrsquos economy.Iran continued to abide by the agreement until last summer, when it began openly breaching some of its limits, saying it would not be bound by the dealit saw none of its promised economic benefits.

Earlier this week, they triggered a dispute mechanism in the nuclear deal to try to bring Iran back into compliance. That process could lead to the halting of international sanctions.In his speech before the bankers, Mr Rouhani acknowledged that the sanctions had caused economic pain, but said such considerations could not be separated from foreign policy and national security.He also acknowledged the steadily rising tensions with the United States.ldquoA single bullet can cause a war, and not shooting a single bullet can lead to peace, he said, adding that his administration is seeking greater security..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Iranian president says  uno limit u to nuclear enrichment article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Even local churches will see a hike in rates with some payments rising by almost %.Meanwhile at least one bank will have their rates reduced by more than % and will pay £k per year less.Many shops in Market Street have had their rates slashed substantially, some by as much as %. A kiosk in High Street Mall will have its annual rates reduced by half.There doesn’t appear to be any change to the rates at the Meadows Shopping Centre while Rushmere Shopping Centre will see a rise of almost %.At least one outlet in Magowan Buildings will have a rates rise of almost % though others will see no change. ASDA will benefit from a drop in rates from £,, to £, - a drop of £k. Tesco Extra in Craigavon will see a % drop in its bill from £,, to £,, - a decrease of £kBucking the trend in the hospitality sector is the Seagoe Hotel which sees no change to its rateable value.The Omniplex Cinema in Craigavon will see the rates rise by almost % from £k to £k.Portadown Fire Station will also see a rates hike of almost % but Cascades Leisure Centre next door, which is due to close, will see a % drop in rates.Portadown Health Centre will see a drop of almost % in rates in April down from £, to £, - a drop of £,.Mr Farrell said: “I think this is a step in the right direction but I have concerns about the rise in rates in the hospitality sector.”He added that there needed to be a ‘radical reform’ of the ‘flawed rates system’ and called for online retailers to contribute to the rates system.In total draft valuations for all , businesses in the Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council area have been published online.Known as Reval – this process will result in a new non-domestic Valuation List being used to calculate business rate bills from April . The Department of Finance said: “This process is about restoring fairness in the rating system by redistributing basically the same rating burden using more up-to-date values. A revaluation is not about collecting more money from businesses, but it is about ensuring that everyone pays their fair share.” Business rates are charged on most non-domestic premises including shops, offices, warehouses, factories, hotels and pubs as well as utilities such as gas, water, electricity and wind farms.The results show a modest growth in the total value in the Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council area of .% compared to the current Valuation List which is based on  values. Sue Gray, Permanent Secretary at Department of Finance said: “The revaluation means that from April, ratepayers will contribute to the funding of essential public services such as health, education and infrastructure as well as a wide range of council services relative to their  rental value, instead of  values as at present.“The growth in the total value of the Valuation List does not translate into a corresponding overall increase in rate bills. I will be seeking to ensure that the regional business rate poundage that we set is lowered to reflect the overall growth in the Valuation List. I will also be encouraging councils to do the same in respect of district rate poundages reflecting the fact that revaluation is not about raising more revenue overall from rates.”If rate poundages are adjusted downwards by both central government and district councilsthis would mean up to % of business ratepayers would either see a reduction or little or no change in their rate bill.Encouraging business ratepayers to view the draft schedule of values, Sue added: “I’m delighted that for the first time we are making the draft valuation list available on our Spatial NI . This will provide ratepayers with greater detail including a breakdown of how their value has been calculated as well as seeing the same information for similar properties in their local area and indeed for all similar properties across Northern Ireland. This approach makes the rating system much more transparent – which is absolutely the right thing to do.“I would encourage business ratepayers to go online and view the new draft values for their properties ahead of rate bills issuing in April.”Preliminary outcomes of the revaluation include:a modest growth in the total value in Northern Ireland of .% many high street shops and some shopping centres will see a decrease in rateable value, with some as much as %many of the edge of town retail parks will remain constant some of the largest food stores show a decrease in rateable value of between % and %the office sector shows an overall increase in rateable value of % andthe pub trade will see considerable iation in values with notable decreases in some pubs and signicant increases in some pubs in busy urban areas.As well as being able to view their new valuation online at a time that suits them, business owners can come along and talk to the Reval team at events across Northern Ireland to find out more about what their new valuation means for them.

Diverging substantiallywill bring in the requirement for inspections at the border for customs. “That hasn’t been agreed formally. That is quite a lot for UK and NI operators to deal with – haulage and freight movers, to get to grips with that. There are major operational challenges.“Northern Ireland also leave the customs union with GB, but there will be a customs border will between GB and NI to continue to essentially allow freight and good to travel.”Since Boris Johnson’s deal was floated, it’s understood the shipping industry is now drawing up plans for EU border checks in Britain for trade bound for Northern Ireland.According to the BBC, freight could be erted through ports with space for inspections at areas such as Liverpool and Stranraer.Richard says checks are likely to be carried out at the ports. The issue  He says backlogs, queues and congestion. “ to queueing back on to ferries and ships, which may miss or mess up timetables,” he says. He says while “many wouldn’t welcome new formalities”, a lot of cargo – such as dry bulk, fuel, aggregates and containerised products –  will find it reasonably easy to deal with. The main concern is around ‘roll on, roll off’, where the containers or lorries are driven on board a ship.“Those modes are where it could be the most problematic, as it’s based on a fluid process,” he says.“I think there is a definite concern from ports and shipping industries that businesses may be impacted negatively, and may reassess business operations.“I wouldn’t say it’s a doomsday scenario but it’s a real challenge for the sector to overcome. Politicians will have to make sure that with any kind of arrangements, there will be a good solution. This is a new proposal, so we are unsure what the details will be.”Brexit aside, Richard says the industry as a whole is that while the largely commercial and independent ports aren’t in need of ‘hand outs’ from the public sector, areas such as connectivity, roads and planning are key to their success.“It’s about making sure the planning system works, and is swt, and responsive,” he said. “They can be agile, for example, building a new shed, terminal or quay, or new developments in the water.“Where there are environmental sensitivities it can sometimes slow down the planning regimes so we are keen to see them not slow down. We welcome environmental policies but we want a scheme that will work and doesn’t have unintended consequences.“Shipping, although not perfect, is one of the most clean and efficient methods of transport. It’s a balance between environmental protection, but enabling ports and regions to grow.“If there are schemes, ports can find there are investors willing to come in, but they do rely on government – local or national – to finance road and rail connectivity.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/year1.jpg","title":"yearbook a look back at ","story":"Posted on Thursday January  by Ulster Business It was another year shaped by political turmoil and the loss of some giants of industry, but it was also a period which saw great opportunity and growth.

In the last few years Pulse PR has worked with clients include Applegreen, during the roll-out of its first stores in Northern Ireland, jewellery retailer Argento that has over  high street stores in Ireland and one of Ireland’s most iconic gt wear brands, Belleek. And with a business spirit which has helped take root due to her father’s own entrepreneurial background, Grainne’s developed her own firm over the last  years – growing with the changing media landscape, creating communications and marketing strategies, working with tech start-ups from the ground up and building on strong media relationships. “For seven years I had worked with PR agencies and businesses such as Barclays, Tayto and Tesco. I was approaching  and I decided it was now or never,” she told Ulster Business. Networking at Down Royal Racecourse with a pocket full of business cards saw her leave with three clients, and from that, the business was born. Although Pulse PR was initially centred around work with public relations and press, Grainne now works with a lot of start-ups, particularly those within tech – her business is also based at Catalyst, formerly the Northern Ireland Science Park, which is the largest technology park here. One of those she’s now working closely with is IRP Commerce – a £m turnover software development company which made it on to Deloitte’s Technology Fast  list of high growth technology companies seven times. “That relationship started eight years ago with a press release, and now I work with them to target retailers, manufacturers and distributors across the UK, promoting its e-commerce  at national conferences and building strategic relationships with key players in the e-commerce industry. When I started it was very traditional PR, and dealing with newspapers and magazines. Now, it’s also grown further into the digital sphere with online PR, blogging and video testimonials. “I’ve seen a big sht in how my time is spent from when I started  years ago. Although clients still value print coverage, there is definitely a demand to create engaging campaigns for social media. “Because of how the world is changing, I have had to ersy as well. It’s about being flexible and realising the developing trends, and trying to adapt. I’ve always been comfortable in front of the camera or with a microphone in my hand so turned this into a business opportunity to host events, commentate on radio or host  at tech conferences – there is an under-representation of women in this sector so it’s a gap I believe I fill.” As a self-employed businesswoman, Grainne extends her reach with clients by collaborating with freelance photographers, designers and videographers. “You have to get results for your clients. I purposely keep my client list manageable so I’m not competing against myself and I can broaden the scope of activity I do for them,” she says. Grainne also works with Catalyst on its Springboard programme as a marketing domain expert, giving start-up companies assistance when they are bringing their product to market. She says most of her clients come through referrals from other companies she’s been involved with. “Referrals are great as it means I’ve done a good job for the person referring me. I also find a lot of work comes from people I have previously worked with or went to school with. Northern Ireland is known for having two degrees of separation – this also applies in the business world.” She’s also been working with the Ulster Farmers’ Union this year to help promote the organisation’s Open Farm Weekend. It’s an initiative, sponsored by Bank of Ireland UK, to allow members of the public to pay a visit to a farm for the first time. “This is a new sector for me, but the principles are the same – find out the end user and then apply the right marketing tools to engage with them. “It’s about fitting in with a company and how that business thinks – being adaptable and working out what they want, and trying to help them grow. It’s about presenting a strong and clear message, developing strong media contacts and also working across digital and print media to boost reach.” In  years, the media and PR landscape has evolved, including how information is consumed. “But I’m still a firm believer in knowing the basics,” she says. “It’s about having the experience and the education to be able to do it. After my degree and Master’s, I studied to gain additional post-graduate qualications from the Chartered Institute of Marketing. I’m a firm believer in le-long learning. Too many people starting in the industry think all the need is a smartphone and an Instagram account. “It’s competitive, but there’s always enough business for everyone out there. You really just need a few clients and then you turn your focus to them, as well as working with others as and when they come. A few projects naturally ended last year so I’ll be expanding my client list in the coming months. It’s always exciting to start with a new company or entrepreneur. “It’s about being flexible and being aware of what is going on with your clients, and being proactive. Being a sole-trader means you are flexible and can work closely with companies, either in their office or remotely as an extended member of their marketing team. I have often thought about employing more staff, but I believe clients want to see me working on their account, rather than meeting me at the pitch and then being passed over to a junior member of staff. “There’s a great satisfaction in helping an innovative small business, which is set for bigger things, and working alongside them in getting their message out there, building, growing and creating jobs. You really want to work with them and help build their business. “It’s about building the relationships and contacts, and that’s something you can’t teach. People buy from people and I believe one of the reasons I have kept many of the same clients for  years is because I always go the extra mile and am true to my word.” Grainne’s desire  years ago to go it alone with Pulse PR is something she says is very much part of the family story. “My father Malachy is an entrepreneur, a mechanic by trade, but he’s always been able to turn his hand to everything,” she says. My sister Orla was also self-employed as a pharmacist. I’ve been brought up in that environment and we’ve always had support and a ‘can do’ attitude from our mother Geraldine. I had a baby, Gabriel, four months ago but didn’t get the option to take maternity leave. This is the downside of being self-employed, but the flipside means I can work from home when I need to.” As for the next  years, Grainne says it’s about trying to give something back, using her skills to help those who have little or no experience in knowing how to bring their message and products to the fore. “I’m still as passionate about business as I was  years ago. I’m excited to see how I can continue to use my skills to add value to clients to ensure their message and their voice is heard.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/234234343334.jpg","title":"stormont deal business back new assembly","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by John Mulgrew Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Julian Smith and Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney.

The Northern Ireland Assembly couldon Fridaypolitical parties back a deal tabled by the UK and Irish Governments. DUP leader Arlene Foster has indicated that her party will back the deal, while Sinn Fein said its leadership will meet to discuss it on Friday. The UUP has said they will consider the deal, but are willing to attend the Assemblyit sits. In a joint statement urging politicians to accept the ‘New Decade, New Approach’ deal, NI Chamber president John Healy, vice president Ian Henry, and chief executive Ann McGregor, said: “After three years of paralysis, we now have a workable deal that will allow an Executive to start addressing the problems within our health service and education system. They will also be able to take action to grow our economy and support the community and voluntary sector. “We therefore encourage the five main political parties to progress it urgently. Business, health and education cannot wait any longer - failure is not an option. “Now is the time for our politicians to show mature leadership and help navigate a path to the future by accepting this deal.” Secretary of State Julian Smith and Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney published the New Decade, New Approach deal on Thursday evening and urged parties to back it andto Stormont on Friday. Reacting to the news, Trade NI – the alliance of Retail NI, Manufacturing NI and Hospitality Ulster – said: “We welcome the draft deal published by the British and Irish Governments in the final round of talks to restore devolution. We strongly encourage all the main parties of Northern Ireland to sign the deal today and get the Assembly back up and running.” “As our three organisations represent the majority of the businesses that make up private sector jobs in Northern Ireland, we are cautiously hopeful that the deal and aof the Assembly will see the development of policies and legislation at devolved level and the kick start that our economy desperately needs. The clear prioritisation of the Northern Ireland economy highlights the many challenges that businesses have faced over the past three years and our message to the parties is that we support you in your endeavours to secure this deal.” “While this is a good start, improvements are still needed to drive the economy forward and support the growth of business across Northern Ireland. As stated in our Vision  document, Northern Ireland’s potential is signicant but reform and growth is needed to create the modern economy we are capable of and deserve.” FSB NI policy chair, Tina McKenzie, said: “Businesses will welcome the agreement published last night as a step forward towards restoring devolved government, something for which FSB has been calling since the collapse of the institutions three years ago. “The draft agreement contains some positive commitments to bolster the local economy, on issues like skills, infrastructure and Brexit. However, theof devolution is by no means a panacea it just means that at long last we have elected representatives in place to tackle a very dficult task. “The next Executive must move quickly to deliver on the myriad issues which have been left unaddressed for far too long. While the health service will be high on the agenda, we must not lose sight of the need to bolster our SME economy, which is the absolute bedrock on which the first-class public services to which we all aspire are built. “Ministers must move swtly to support our economy at one of the most turbulent times for many decades, starting by lowering the rates burden on small businesses, whilst also moving forward rapidly with key infrastructure projects which have stalled and ensuring that our schools, colleges, and universities are providing students with the skills they need for the jobs of the future. “In order to begin to address these issues, the parties must put pragmatism first and get back round the Executive table.” Colin Neill, chief executive, Hospitality Ulster, said: “We encourage all parties to seize this opportunity and sign up to the deal published late last night to get the Assembly and Executive back as quickly as possible.” “This is the best chance to bring the devolved government back to le. Our message to the party leaders is clear, we support you in your endeavours and encourage you to get the New Decade, New Approach agreement over the line today. Redmond McFadden, president of the Londonderry Chamber of Commerce said: “The Londonderry Chamber as well as other representatives of business, education, health, trade unions and civic organisations, held a meeting with the five main political parties at Stormont last night. “At that meeting we pressed the urgent need for the parties to agree the draft deal which was published by the British and Irish Governments. Three years without Ministers making local decisions has had an enormous impact on our economy and wider society. A lack of effective and meaningful representation here is curtailing investment in our region, stling job creation and driving our young people away. Simon Hamilton, chief executive of Belfast Chamber, said: “Belfast Chamber welcomes progress towards the restoration of the Northern Ireland Executive and encourages the local political parties to reach agreement. For the last three years, our members have seen how an absence of decision making has stunted growth and stled investment. The proposed priorities for the Executive contain some issues which Belfast Chamber has been supportive of for some time. “Other policies which could boost our economy are noticeably missing but we look forward to joining with our colleagues across the business community to ensure that the new Executive pursues an agenda that grows jobs and boosts our economy.” Northern Ireland Local Government Association chief executive, Derek McCallan said: “I am very pleased that the British and Irish governments have tabled a draft deal on restoring the NI Executive. I hope that an agreement can be reached quickly to get the Stormont institutions back up and running immediately. For three years, our eleven local councils have been the only ing form of democratically elected government in Northern Ireland. Local government has been a vital democratic anchor during this period and ensured the provision of crucial public services for local citizens. “It’s time to bridge the democratic deficit and unlock the potential of local government in Northern Ireland by investing in our local councils. An Executive commitment to a devolution bill and greater financial powers and resources will drive a transformation in Northern Ireland’s democratic governance and help create a more sustainable democracy, environment and economy for Northern Ireland.” Kirsty McManus, national director, IoD NI, said: “The ‘New Decade, New Approach’ deal is to be welcomed, filled with ambition that,fulfilled, can deliver real improvements for the people and businesses of Northern Ireland. “We would therefore urge all parties to get behind the deal to enable the speedy restoration of the Executive. “Commitments from the British and Irish governments for some crucial pieces of infrastructure such as the York Street Interchange, upgrades to the A and A road and Northern Ireland’s wastewater network are particularly pleasing. “The expansion of university provision at the Magee campus in Derry meanwhile will go some way to rebalancing the regional economy. “Plans for multi-year budgets and increased civic engagement will also improve overall governance. “From a business perspective however, we would have liked to have seen more around a new skills agenda, which urgently require focus alongside a renewed look at the Apprenticeship Levy which is not included in this deal. “On behalf of our members, we will also monitor closely commitments to bring forward legislation that will allow unfettered access to the Great Britain market for local business following Brexit.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail_Abacus-Grand-Central-1--1-.jpg","title":"belfastforlife expo bringing together ni diaspora","story":"Posted on Monday  January  by Ulster Business A new event will bring together the Northern Ireland diaspora and business community in a bid to promote and develop the region.
