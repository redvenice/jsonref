[{"url":null,"title":"The story picture Andrew Virginia Giuffre Maxwell journalist scooped world","story":"Share this article She was headhunted for the job by Maxwell, who spotted her at Donald Trump\u0027s Mar a Lago club in Palm Beach, where she was a $9-an-hour changing-room assistant and her father was a maintenance manager.The club employed scores of workers in similar positions over the years, but gradually I accumulated clues: a source recalled that her maiden name was Virginia Roberts.And I learned that she continued to date her high-school sweetheart, Tony Figueroa, after Maxwell trained her to give Epstein \u0027erotic massages\u0027.His family\u0027s address was in old property records. They\u0027d moved from Palm Beach, a neighbour told me when I knocked on her door, but she remembered Virginia.\u0027She was a sad, anorexic-looking girl,\u0027 she said.I located Tony in the small town of Flowery Branch, Georgia – an eight-hour drive north of Palm Beach – and he confirmed what had seemed a totally incredible tale.Epstein had approved of him continuing his romance with Virginia, he told me when we met at a coffee shop.\u0027I moved into her apartment in Royal Palm Beach. She was working for Jeffrey. I assume the cash she got from him paid for it.\u0027I would give her rides to his house. I would hang out there – sit by the pool, talk to the chef. Jeffrey treated me like a friend. I never got any weird vibes until she told me what was going on.\u0027And then the bombshell. When Tony picked up Virginia from a trip to London on Epstein\u0027s jet, she showed him a photo of herself with Prince Andrew.\u0027She told me Jeffrey was hanging out with Andrew and she had hung out with him,\u0027 he said. \u0027It was supposedly just massages.\u0027He was sickened because he had come to understand that in Epstein\u0027s warped circles, massage was a euphemism for sex.\u0027I tried to get her to stop the trips with Jeffrey but she didn\u0027t. I think she was scared.\u0027Tony gave me the next lead to Virginia\u0027s whereabouts. Her father\u0027s name, he confided, was Sky Roberts. I left a message at his number, saying I was investigating Epstein.On February 4, 2011, an email landed that would change the course of history for Andrew.\u0027Hi Sharon,\u0027 Virginia wrote. \u0027My Father, Sky Roberts, informed me of your call and I thought I\u0027d send you my contact details so we can get in touch.\u0027When I called her Australian number, her voice was shaky but determined and the first word from her lips was \u0027Andrew\u0027.He was the Royal in her lawsuit, she told me, and, while initially reluctant to talk publicly, she eventually decided she wanted to waive her anonymity and tell her story because she was furious that he was still hanging out with Epstein after the financier\u0027s conviction for offences related to child prostitution.Just a few days before, she had seen a photo – published by the now defunct News of the World – that revealed the Prince had taken a stroll in Manhattan\u0027s Central Park with Epstein after the wealthy pervert had completed a slap- on-the-wrist jail sentence for abusing underage girls.She had also read about a dinner party that Epstein threw for Andrew during the New York visit, which was attended by celebrities including Woody Allen.Little could Andrew have known that that image of him casually chatting to his old friend in the park would end up so enraging Virginia she would agree to talk to me.\u0027I am appalled,\u0027 she told me when I arrived at her modest ranch home 60 miles north of Sydney. \u0027To me, it\u0027s saying, We are above the law.\u0027I was exhausted after 24 hours of travel from my home in New York via San Francisco to Sydney and then a 90-minute drive in a rental car on unfamiliar roads. But from the moment I set eyes on that picture, my jet-lag evaporated.For the entire journey I hadn\u0027t slept because Virginia had warned me she might not be able to find the picture.Now she had found it and, of course, I knew it was a huge scoop. But I had mixed emotions. This was a woman who was a victim of the most evil child sex ring I have heard about during my 40-year career.I was worried for Virginia and the fallout going public would have on her. I knew her life would never be the same again.She was clearly still absolutely terrified of Epstein. She told me she had seen shady characters hanging around her house who she was convinced had been sent by the billionaire to bully and intimidate her into silence.Yet here she was, bravely telling a story which would set off a cataclysmic chain of events that would change her life – and Andrew\u0027s – for ever.By the time I met Virginia, she was happily married to Robert Giuffre, an Australian martial arts expert whom she met by chance when Epstein flew her to Thailand for a massage course. They had two sons and a daughter.But she couldn\u0027t put the memories of her years in Epstein\u0027s cult-like household behind her. She wanted both him and Andrew to be brought to justice.We sat in her garden and I remember the terror in her eyes as she told her story to a journalist for the first time.She gave me a graphic description of the hours she claims to have spent with the Prince after Maxwell and Epstein left her on that London night. For reasons of taste, they can\u0027t be included here.\u0027It was disgusting,\u0027 she said, shaking her head.\u0027I\u0027ve gone from pain to hurt to anger. Coming from my background, I thought I was important, being with a big, famous man. But being a mother has changed my perspective on life.\u0027After my week-long first meetings with her, I received word that a US prosecutor, Ann Marie Villafana, was trying to reach me. She told me when I called that she had heard I was talking to Virginia.\u0027The FBI would like to fly to Sydney to interview her,\u0027 she said.Virginia wept when I passed on the message. She was still living in fear of Epstein. Would he hurt her, she wondered, if she co-operated with the FBI?And would it do any good? She had talked to some investigators just three years earlier, yet \u0027there\u0027s Jeffrey in Central Park with Andrew\u0027.She agreed to meet two FBI agents. Michael Thomas and I drove her and her husband to the US Consulate in Sydney.We weren\u0027t allowed to accompany Virginia inside, but she told us she confirmed the account she had given us and handed them her collection of snaps, including the print we had copied showing her with Maxwell and the Prince.They handed it back to her after making a scan.Since that day there has been much speculation about what happened to what has been dubbed the \u0027original\u0027 photograph.To the best of my knowledge, she still has it. I\u0027ve never heard anything about her destroying it.A redacted court document reportedly shows that she gave 20 photos to the FBI in 2011 and they were scanned front and back. But there are only 19 shown in a public record of the meeting.The FBI assigned sequential reference numbers to both the front and back of each photo. But two reference numbers – 03956 9431 and 03956 9432 – are missing from the publicly available document.Panorama was told those two numbers are for the front and back of the Andrew photo and that it was removed from the public document to protect his privacy.The lawmen refused to tell me their verdict on the picture. \u0027But if she faked it, they\u0027d have indicted her a long time ago for perjury,\u0027 I was told by a source familiar with the probe.A Californian digital photography expert, Hany Farid, told The Times he saw no \u0027obvious signs\u0027 that the photo was doctored.\u0027It can be difficult to get the body poses just right when splicing two people together,\u0027 he said.\u0027The fact that the two figures are so seamlessly and closely placed next to each other suggests that this is unlikely to be a full-body splice of Prince Andrew.\u0027The lighting and pose of the head seem consistent with the body and scene, suggesting that it is also unlikely that this is Prince Andrew\u0027s head spliced on to another person\u0027s body,\u0027 he said.Without that photograph, no one would have taken Virginia\u0027s word over that of the Queen\u0027s favourite son.If Andrew still believes it was cooked up by a \u0027gold-digger\u0027, I\u0027m happy to take his call."},{"url":null,"title":"Prince Harry renews Frogmore Cottage lease making eligible serve Queen Counsellor","story":"Share this articlePrince Harry will renew Frogmore Cottage lease to keep serving Queen"},{"url":null,"title":"Man City star Phil Foden mother involved scuffle","story":"Share this articlePhil Foden\u0027s mum Claire, 41, caught in alcohol-fuelled brawl which left a woman with black eyes and bite marks"},{"url":null,"title":"Queen 95 tested positive Covid mild cold like symptoms","story":" The monarch is expected to foot part of the bill for her son\u0027s settlement in a bid to draw a line under it before her much-anticipated Platinum Jubilee celebrations this summer.But there is anger at how the Queen has effectively been forced to bail out the \u0027disgraced\u0027 Duke of York, 61, whose modest pension from his time in the Royal Navy is now his only visible income - amid calls for the public to be told who is financing the deal.Andrew marked the quietest royal birthday in modern history yesterday as he looks to lay low after settling his sex abuse case.The muted celebration of his 62nd birthday came just hours after the death of Jeffrey Epstein\u0027s \u0027pimp\u0027, who was accused of trafficking hundreds of girls to the paedophile financier.French modelling agent Jean-Luc Brunel, 76, who allegedly procured more than a thousand women and girls for Epstein to sleep with, was found hanged in his prison cell in an alleged suicide on Saturday morning. And Charles could also be questioned by the Met Police as part of its criminal \u0027cash for honours\u0027 investigation into his aide and charity. The Royal, 73, nor anyone in his household have been spoken to as part of the force\u0027s assessment on whether to probe how a Saudi billionaire donor got a knighthood and UK citizenship after donations to the Prince\u0027s Foundation.Instead officers have liaised with staff at the charity, who have provided documents for the scoping exercise.But Charles and his former right-hand aide Michael Fawcett, 59, have been both explicitly named in the two letters to the Met that sparked the investigation. Fawcett stepped down in October amid claims he promised to help secure a CBE and British citizenship for Mahfouz Marei Mubarak bin Mahfouz - a donor to the Prince\u0027s Foundation.It was alleged that he paid thousands of pounds to \u0027fixers\u0027 with links to the prince who said they could secure him an honour in return for donations.Clarence House has denied Charles knew anything about the allegations being investigated. And Prince Harry the monarch has also been dealing with revelations that Prince Harry tried to keep details of his legal battle to reinstate his police protection secret from the public.High Court documents show he sought a far-reaching confidentiality order on documents and witness statements surrounding his case against the Government.But the Home Office argued for transparency, saying \u0027there must be a sufficiently good reason, in the wider public interest, to justify the departure from open justice that such an order involves\u0027. The Queen\u0027s positive test comes as Boris Johnson today urged people to be \u0027more confident and get back to work\u0027 as he heralded this coming Thursday as Covid Freedom Day. The PM gave an upbeat assessment ahead of unveiling his \u0027Living with Covid Plan\u0027 tomorrow, insisting vaccines and new treatments can be relied upon to keep the public safe.All curbs - including legal self-isolation - are set to end in England within days, and Mr Johnson made clear that the taxpayer cannot keep shelling out £2billion a month on mass testing.In a compromise between the Treasury and Department of Health, he will lay out a timetable for axing free tests - but they are still likely to be available for more vulnerable and older age groups.As cases continue to tumble - down 25 per cent week-on-week - Mr Johnson insisted he did not want people to \u0027throw caution to the winds\u0027 but he wanted to remove \u0027compulsion\u0027 and let iniduals take responsibility."},{"url":null,"title":"Capitol fence reinstalled ahead Bidens State Union trucker convoy heads DC","story":"Share this articleCapitol fence to be reinstalled ahead of Biden¿s State of the Union address | Fox NewsUSCP Plans for Extra Security Ahead of the Joint Session of Congress | United States Capitol PoliceAmerican Truckers\u0027 \u0027Freedom\u0027 Convoy to D.C. to Launch February 23, Organizers Say"},{"url":null,"title":"Queen plans honour appointments online phone following positive Covid test","story":"Share this articleBuckingham Palace to remain ‘cautious’ despite relaxing of Covid rules"},{"url":null,"title":"What does Freedom Day mean business","story":"Share this article   Meanwhile, education unions Unison, Unite and the GMB urged the Prime Minister to keep free testing and the requirement to self-isolate.They warned that failure to provide detailed guidance risks a \u0027super-spreader free-for-all\u0027 in schools and workplaces. A government source said vaccines would be available for the \u0027foreseeable future\u0027, saying avoiding the return of curbs would depend on the \u0027sustained population immunity\u0027 provided by the jabs.It came as the Government yesterday logged another 25,696 daily Covid cases and 74 deaths. "},{"url":null,"title":"Weymouth beach hut cartel strikes tenant evicted","story":"Share this article Elizabeth and Tony Fisher have been tenants since 1987 and visit their chalet daily between May and October each year because they are keen sea swimmers.But they received a letter from the trust saying they can no longer lease the chalet and there was no right of appeal.Ms Fisher, a 69-year-old retired modern languages teacher, said they were told they did not renew their lease in time, which they claim is untrue.She said: \u0027We have had a good innings in the chalet and I have been trying hard to think that it is time someone from the waiting list had a chance to enjoy what we have had for so many years.\u0027But the sour taste in the mouth from the suspicion that one has been unfairly dislodged remains.\u0027Mrs Bray was approached for comment but said: \u0027No, we do not talk about inidual people.

Photograph: Atef SafadiEPAChildren aged 12 to 15 are to be offered a booster dose of Covid-19 vaccine in a bid to reduce infection rates among this age group.The move follows a recommendation by the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac), which has been accepted by Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly. The go-ahead was given by Niac despite the lack of authorisation by the European Medicines Agency for boosters doses for this age group.The EMA is currently assessing an application by PfizerBioNTech for use of its booster vaccine in adolescents from 12 years.Because off-licence use is being allowed in Ireland, Mr Donnelly said special attention would be paid to the provision of support and guidance information as part of the informed consent process for children and young people and their parents. Seventy per cent of 12-15 year-olds are fully vaccinated.Niac has said a booster dose of the PfizerBioNTech vaccine should be given at an interval of six months or longer after completion of the primary vaccine series.Where a child in the age group has been infected, the booster dose should be deferred for at least six months following the onset of infection, according to Niac.Although the Omicron variant is less severe than previous variants, soaring cases since December has resulted in more people, including young people, being hospitalised.According to Niac, 260 12-15 year-olds were hospitalised between December 19th and February 9th, when Omicron was dominant. Six of these were admitted to ICU none died.The rate at which children in this age group was hospitalised has increased from 1.8 per 100,000 in the first wave of the pandemic to 38.54 in the most recent, fifth wave. The rate of ICU admission in the fifth wave was 0.38 per 100,000.Of the 20 admissions to ICU of young people aged under 18 between January 1st and February 16th, 17 were unvaccinated. Children and adolescents who contract Covid-19 are also at risk of a rare but serious conditions known as multisystem inflammatory syndrome. There have been 15 such admissions to ICU among 10-15 year-olds between January 2020 to February 2022. “In adults, a booster dose with an mRNA vaccine significantly improves protection against severe outcomes, symptomatic diseases and infection from the Omicron variant of Covid-19,” Mr Donnelly said. “Niac have indicated that vaccine efficacy against symptomatic infection and hospitalisation was restored to 60-75 per cent and 90 per cent, respectively, two to four weeks after administration of a booster in the adult population.”Mr Donnelly cited evidence from Israel’s booster programme showing a significant reduction in the confirmed rate of infection in those aged 12-15 following the booster dose compared with those of the same age who were vaccinated with the primary series five to six months earlier.“The benefits of vaccination – the prevention of serious illness and death – are clear. However, the reduction in rate of infection is important as Ireland removes some of the last public health restrictions in place.” The Minister said the Department of Health and the HSE will now work to operationalise the change. The provision of boosters to 12-15-year-olds is expected to begin soon, as vaccination centres are currently experiencing low levels of demand.Covid casesAnother 3,473 PCR-confirmed cases of Covid-19 have been recorded in the State, while a further 2,865 people have registered a positive antigen test through the HSE portal, the National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) reported in a statement on Monday afternoon.It also confirmed that as of 8am on Monday, 634 Covid-19 patients were hospitalised, of whom 53 were in ICU. As well as reporting these latest Covid figures, the Nphet statement also included new case figures for the weekend.On Sunday, another 3,351 PCR-confirmed cases of Covid-19 were reported, while a further 2,574 positive antigen tests were recorded through the HSE portal.Meanwhile, on Saturday, another 4,847 PCR-confirmed cases of Covid-19 were reported, while a further 3,076 positive antigen tests were recorded through the portal.In Northern Ireland, four more people who had previously recently tested positive for Covid-19 have died, the North’s Department of Health said on Monday. Another 2,235 confirmed cases of the virus were also notified in the North in its latest 24-hour reporting period. On Monday morning there were 443 Covid-19 patients in the North’s hospitals, 12 of whom were in intensive care.A further Covid-19 booster vaccine is to be offered to all of those aged 75 and over in Northern Ireland. The North’s Department of Health said the additional jab will also be offered to anyone over the age of 12 who is immunosuppressed. The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) has advised that those at a higher risk of infection receive the additional booster this spring.

Photograph: Steve ParsonsPAQueen Elizabeth is experiencing “mild cold like symptoms” after testing positive for Covid-19 but expects to be at her desk carrying out “light duties”, Buckingham Palace has said.Concerns for the queen (95) will be heightened given her age and recent health scare but it appears the head of state is determined to carry out what tasks she can despite contracting the virus.The diagnosis follows a string of Covid cases among Britain’s royal family and the queen’s Windsor Castle team, with the Prince of Wales meeting the monarch the week he tested positive, and the Duchess of Cornwall also isolating after contracting the virus.The announcement was made just a few weeks after Britain’s longest-reigning monarch reached her historic Platinum Jubilee of 70 years on the throne on February 6th.Buckingham Palace said in a statement: “Buckingham Palace confirm that The Queen has today tested positive for Covid.“Her Majesty is experiencing mild cold-like symptoms but expects to continue light duties at Windsor over the coming week.“She will continue to receive medical attention and will follow all the appropriate guidelines.The royal household has its own royal physicians and the queen’s doctors will be on hand to take care of and monitor the head of state, with Professor Sir Huw Thomas, head of the medical household and physician to the queen, expected to be in charge.It is understood the queen is following Covid guidelines on self-isolating after testing positive but prime minister Boris Johnson is expected to repeal all pandemic regulations that restrict public freedoms in England when he lays out his vision for the future on Monday.The queen is believed to be triple vaccinated but until recently had been on doctors’ orders to rest since mid October, after cancelling a run of engagements and spending a night in hospital undergoing preliminary tests.Just a few weeks ago, the monarch had begun to resume her normal duties, hosting at Sandringham her largest reception in months, on the eve of her Platinum Jubilee anniversary, and a few days later held her first in-person audience with the prime minister in many weeks.The queen is believed to have spent time with Charles, Prince of Wales, on February 8, when he hosted an investiture at her Windsor Castle home, and a few days later he tested positive for Covid but made a quick recovery to full health.Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, has also tested positive for Covid, with Clarence House confirming on February 14th that the duchess was self isolating. – PAEverything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"young africans","story":"About 2.4 million forced to leave their homes during 13-year-long war with Boko HaramTom Saater has a rags to riches story and a unique insight into Nigeria\u0026rsquos biggest cityIn one of the world\u0026rsquos most dangerous places to attend school, teachers lead lessons and the students comeAfrican country\u0026rsquos tech innovators call for international investment and domestic supportYoung Nigerians dance out onto world stage with pride, confidence and high ambitionWomen-led organisation aims to stop atrocities of dictatorship from reoccurringIn the Gambia, a flourishing comedy scene is used to convey serious messagesStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"estonia urges nato send troops eastern europe send strong message","story":"Nato must send thousands more troops to eastern Europe after Russia\u0027s de facto annexation of Belarus, the Estonian defence minister has said. Kalle Laanet warned that the threat to Ukraine had increased significantly after President Putin decided to indefinitely extend the stay of its troops in Belarus, where military exercises had been due to end at the weekend. Speaking to The  at the Estonian embassy in London, Mr Laanet said that by keeping Russian forces in Belarus it was effectively a vassal state of the Kremlin.“In my point of view it is two states, one leader, and they are together,” Mr Laanet said.He said it was “concerning” that 30,000 troops remained in Belarus and warned that being just “100 kilometres from Vilnius or from Warsaw”, meant Russian troops had shortened their “readiness time” to invade.  He cautioned that if Putin did not push for an invasion in the “short term”, it would take place in the “long term,” and that Russia would keep troops on the border, possibly for years to come. He claimed that “for Putin, it is not a problem to keep soldiers in tents” and predicted most of the troops currently in Belarus would stay put. “Nato has to strengthen the eastern flank,” Mr Laanet stressed, as he said that this could be done by sending thousands more troops and “extra capabilities” to neighbouring countries such as Latvia, Lithuania and Poland. He said the act of deploying more troops to these countries not only provided protection but acted as a deterrent to Moscow and would send a “strong message to Russia”. However, Mr Laanet said that as well as more troops, a combination of greater air defence, ground capabilities and cyber security were essential to protecting the eastern flank. Currently, the UK has sent 1,700 British troops to Estonia. Around 850 soldiers from First Battalion, The Royal Welsh left for Estonia last week, where they joined 900 British military personnel already based in the Baltic state. Britain also has a Light Cavalry Squadron of about 150 people deployed to Poland. Mr Laanet said those British troops who had deployed alongside their Estonian counterparts  “had a very good cooperation they understand each other”. He said soldiers from Nato countries training together was more important than ever because if they go to war with Russia, they will do so “side by side” and have finessed “how to act together”. Despite the fact that “Russia is threat number one”, Mr Laanet insisted that members of the alliance were unafraid. “I believe that the whole world is concerned, but we as members of NATO and also members of the European Union, are not afraid,” he said, adding that “Russia accepts only power”. Citing Estonia’s former belonging to the Soviet Union, Mr Laanet said his country was all too aware of “what kind of threat can come to Estonia”. However, he said that for thirty years the country had been preparing to take care of itself and now “mentally and physically we are ready to protect our country”. Ultimately, Mr Laanet conceded that the possibility of war with Ukraine coincided with Putin approaching his 70th birthday and his desire “to build up his legacy”. “When he started as a president, he said very clearly he would like to enlarge the influence of Russia, by territory, mentally, and all these things together. And he’s doing it: Georgia in 2008, Ukraine in 2014.”He stressed that in light of Putin’s desire to invade, the most important thing for Nato remained “the unity of the West”. “Putin would like to destroy this.”  More from NewsRussia-Ukraine crisis: UK to announce sanctions after Putin recognises breakaway regions‘Betamax’ police forces failing to recognise the digital ‘crime challenges of

Protocol broke up with a disagreement over olive oil shipments.The former Brexit minister criticised Brussels’ negotiators for being fixated over the “strategic risk” of everyday products being shipped to the province as Europe faces its biggest war since 1945.His intervention came after Foreign Secretary Liz Truss and her EU counterpart, Maros Sefcovic, once again failed to break the deadlock in the long-running negotiations over the implementation of the post-Brexit trade rules for Northern Ireland.“At one end of our continent, the EU is working with us on great matters of war and peace, life and death,” Lord Frost said.“At the other, it is worrying about the strategic risk from olive oil.“Isn’t it time for the EU to be sensible and find a sustainable solution on the

cutting the number of controls by up to 80 per cent in order to ease the burdens of the Brexit deal on Northern Ireland, but on Monday its negotiators raised concerns that unchecked bottles of olive oil could pose a threat to the EU Single Market. “The issue is, does the EU know what goods are coming into its Single Market,” an EU official said.But privately British negotiators said the bloc’s strategy would likely backfire, as it paints the EU as the intransigent party.A UK Government source told the : “While we’re focused on peace and stability in Northern Ireland, the EU are obsessing about types of olive oil and making themselves look unreasonable.“It misses the bigger picture and looks tone-deaf when we could be about to see a war in Eastern Europe.”Speaking after the talks, Ms Truss told Mr Sefcovic that the bloc needs to improve its offer to cut red tape, which unionists argue has driven a wedge between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.“We need to see things change on the ground, we need to see goods flow much more freely,” added the Foreign Secretary. Mr Sefcovic said it was important to rebuild UK-EU relations in order to face down the Russian threat of aggression towards Ukraine.He said: “Today’s current challenging times call, more than ever before, for a strong partnership between the EU and the UK.”More from NewsRussia-Ukraine crisis: UK to

vulnerable","story":"Millions of over-50s could be offered Covid boosters this autumn, as Boris Johnson hailed Britain\u0027s vaccine rollout as key to restoring our liberties in full.Fourth jabs will start being offered to those aged 75 and over from next month, with a further rollout of vaccines expected later this year, when the programme may be much more widely extended.Announcing the end of legal requirements to self-isolate from Thursday and a major scaling back of free testing from April, Mr Johnson praised the extraordinary success of the vaccine rollout.He told a Downing Street press conference: Today is not the day we can declare victory over Covid, because this virus is not going away. But it is the day when all the efforts of the last two years finally enable us to protect ourselves whilst restoring our liberties in full.After two of the darkest, grimmest years in our peacetime history, I do believe this is a moment of pride for our nation.The Government’s scientific advisers on Monday said an extra spring dose will be advised for around eight million elderly and vulnerable people, with the rollout starting within weeks.The groups are also likely to be offered further doses in the autumn, the Joint Committee on Vaccine and Immunisation (JCVI) said, in a programme which could be extended far more widely – potentially to cover all over-50s.Mr Johnson set out the strategy for living with Covid after his Cabinet meeting was delayed by rows between Sajid Javid, the Health Secretary, and Rishi Sunak, the Chancellor, over funding.Sajid Javid had been pushing for more than £5 billion to maintain more free testing – including regular tests for asymptomatic NHS staff – but lost the argument, with the Department of Health told funds for remaining tests would come out of its existing budget.At the Downing Street press conference, Sir Chris Whitty, the Chief Medical Officer, and Sir Patrick Vallance, the Chief Scientific Adviser, repeatedly expressed concern about who will be eligible for free tests.The Government has said the most vulnerable groups will still be able to access free tests, with suggestions that all over-80s would fall in this group.Sir Patrick said getting the definition right was critical, with Sir Chris saying a key decision was yet to be made to ensure that those who could benefit from antiviral medicine were able to get tests.But on Monday night Mr Johnson insisted people should not think there was a ision between gung-ho politicians and cautious, anxious scientists.He said Britain needed to face the fact that there could be, likely will be, another variant that will cause us trouble, adding that the sun is shining but we\u0027re keeping our umbrella in the fight against the virus, with surveillance to spot new variants and act on emerging trends.Sir Chris acknowledged that deaths were at slightly lower than average levels, pointing out that far higher numbers were now dying from causes other than Covid. He highlighted striking figures showing the impact of vaccines on hospitalisation rates.On Monday, the JCVI said it had advised ministers that a wider booster campaign in the autumn is very likely to be recommended. It may be run along the lines of the annual flu jab programme, which is aimed at around half the population, including everyone over 50.  Officials said no decision had yet been taken on the size of any autumn rollout.The vaccine programme will see fourth jabs offered to those aged 75 and over and to care home residents from next month – around six months after their booster – with GPs and pharmacists involved in the rollout.People over 12 who are immunosuppressed will also be offered an extra jab, which for many will be their fifth dose. Over-18s will be offered the Moderna or Pfizer vaccines, while those 12 to 18 will be offered Pfizer.The boosts are being offered as a precautionary measure amid concern that immunity wanes more quickly in older and vulnerable groups. Booster jabs began to be rolled out in September, meaning it is now around five months since the programme began.Officials said the committee has provided interim advice to ministers on the rollout of jabs this autumn. It says a further booster ... is likely to be advised for people who are at higher risk of severe Covid-19.Scientists said it was too early to set out precise details of what that programme may look like, but added that it was likely to cover a wider group.Prof Wei Shen Lim, the JCVI chairman of Covid vaccination, said: Last year\u0027s booster vaccination programme has so far provided excellent protection against severe Covid-19. To maintain high levels of protection for the most vulnerable iniduals in the population, an extra spring dose of vaccine is advised ahead of an expected autumn booster programme.The JCVI will continue its rolling review of the vaccination programme and the epidemiological situation, particularly in relation to the timing and value of doses for less vulnerable older adults and those in clinical risk groups ahead of autumn.Mr Javid said Britain\u0027s vaccine rollout had made it the freest country in Europe, adding that had asked the NHS to plan a further rollout of jabs in the spring following the new advice.The latest data on those aged 75 and over shows that booster jabs are 93 per cent effective against hospitalisation, and only fall to 88 per cent at 10 weeks.It follows much debate about how future rollouts of jabs should be targeted. Sir Andrew Pollard, the chairman of the JCVI, last month told The : We can\u0027t vaccinate the planet every four to six months. It\u0027s not sustainable or affordable. In the future, we need to target the vulnerable.More from NewsRussia-Ukraine crisis: UK to announce sanctions after Putin recognises breakaway regions‘Betamax’ police forces failing to recognise the digital ‘crime challenges of today’Vladimir Putin channels his inner King Lear in the Kremlin’s theatre of warVladimir Putin warns of ‘bloodshed’ as he orders Russian forces into UkraineSolicitor caused £500,000 worth of damage after injecting his blood into supermarket foodOligarchs lobby Foreign Office in bid to avoid sanctions if Russia invades UkraineMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"fully vaccinated britons allowed europe without pre departure","story":"All fully-jabbed British travellers will be allowed into the European Union without tests under a travel blueprint to be approved by the European Council on Tuesday.Children aged six to 18 who have not been fully jabbed will also be allowed to travel into EU countries provided that they have a negative pre-departure PCR test.The plans, which will cover visitors from all non-EU countries including the UK, are designed to end the patchwork of different regulations that EU countries have used, causing confusion for many British holidaymakers.Italy and the Netherlands currently require all travellers from the UK to have a negative lateral flow or PCR test before they can enter the countries. Italy also conducts random Covid testing on arrival and demands a rapid lateral flow test on entry.The European Commission is said to be “optimistic” most EU and EEA countries will implement the new EU Council recommendation, although they are not rules so member states can deviate from them if they choose.The regime will come into effect on Mar 1, well in advance of the Easter school holidays in the first two weeks of April, and is expected to apply to all those who have been double or triple jabbed within 270 days of their arrival within the country.The 20 per cent of adults in the UK who have not had a booster will be treated as unvaccinated if they have not been double jabbed within 270 days of arrival. In Italy, this currently means five days’ self-isolation and a ban from the Netherlands.The changes will mean travel protocols from outside the EU are aligned with those within the EU, with the rules based on travellers’ personal health status rather than the epidemiological situation of the countryarea of departure.Paul Charles, the chief executive of travel consultancy The PC Agency said: “A one-size-fits-all policy for those who have been fully jabbed makes absolute sense and would enable European economies to bounce back faster.“The one way to revive travel across Europe is to have a consistent policy for those coming from the UK, which is a such a huge market for the EU.”Most countries are expected to retain passenger locator forms (PLFs) for arrivals, although Grant Shapps, the Transport Secretary, is pressing to scrap the UK’s by the Easter holidays.As an interim measure the forms, in which people must provide contact and travel details, are to be significantly simplified in the coming weeks.The travel industry has been calling for the cumbersome documents to be scrapped, saying they are acting as a drag on British holiday firms.However, moves to get rid of the forms have been slowed down by objections from the Department of Health and Social Care, which has been in favour of tougher curbs.Tim Alderslade, the chief executive of trade body Airlines UK, said: “Ministers are absolutely right to remove the remaining restrictions but this needs to cut across all elements of the economy, including travel.“If there is no requirement to self-isolate for those with Covid in the UK, jabbed or otherwise, there can be no justification for continuing with travel restrictions for the unvaccinated, including the continued use of the PLF which, although not as bad as testing, remains a deterrent to travel.”The documents have already been simplified once, to shorten the time it takes to fill them in. By the end of the month, people will be given an extra day to fill them out. It is a criminal offence to provide false or deliberately misleading information when filling out the form.Unvaccinated travellers arriving in the UK will also continue to have to take pre-departure tests and PCR tests on or before day two of their entry to the UK.More from NewsRussia-Ukraine crisis: UK to announce sanctions after Putin recognises breakaway regions‘Betamax’ police forces failing to recognise the digital ‘crime challenges of today’Vladimir Putin channels his inner King Lear in the Kremlin’s theatre of warVladimir Putin warns of ‘bloodshed’ as he orders Russian forces into UkraineSolicitor caused £500,000 worth of damage after injecting his blood into supermarket foodOver-50s set to be offered Covid booster vaccines this autumnMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"lifting restrictions right thing do","story":"For a while yesterday, a delay to a Cabinet meeting called to agree an end to pandemic restrictions in England prompted speculation that Freedom Day had been put on hold. Fortunately, the concerns were misplaced. The cause was a disagreement between the Treasury and the Department of Health over funding free Covid tests after measures are lifted. Sajid Javid had reportedly requested some £5 billion to continue free testing but was rightly beaten back by the Chancellor, though help will continue for more than 1 million clinically vulnerable people and NHS staff obliged to test.One reason for seeking to “live with Covid” is to stop spending vast sums on testing mostly healthy people on a daily basis. This is money that could be spent elsewhere in the NHS without raising taxes. Ending the legal requirement to self-isolate in England from Thursday obviates the need for mass testing altogether and it is right to stop it, though why wait until April? Outside of the most vulnerable, if someone suspects they might have Covid, they can pay for a test kit to find out.In the Commons, Mr Johnson said that while Covid was now an endemic disease it should be dealt with without recourse to emergency powers, which are to be repealed early. Protection against Covid would henceforth rely on the exercise of personal responsibility, backed by vaccines and treatments. This is precisely the right, proportionate and balanced approach that we have urged on the Prime Minister for some time but one which (mostly masked) opposition MPs still could not bring themselves to support.The state cannot continue to impose restrictions on people other than in an emergency. Now that one no longer exists, Sir Keir Starmer is wrong to object when the rates of infection have fallen, hospitals are coping well and deaths are below average for the time of year. Labour seems wedded to legal compulsion for its own sake.But senseless red tape remains. For instance, restrictions on visitors to care homes are unduly onerous and should be modified. Moreover, if it is no longer mandatory to self-isolate, why do people arriving in the UK need to fill in passenger locator forms? These complicated documents act as a pointless barrier to travel which the hard-pressed tourism industry could do without.Mr Johnson hinted that they may be scrapped in time for the Easter holidays. Why wait? They should be dropped now for all the good they do.More from NewsRussia-Ukraine crisis: UK to announce sanctions after Putin recognises breakaway regions‘Betamax’ police forces failing to recognise the digital ‘crime challenges of today’Vladimir Putin channels his inner King Lear in the Kremlin’s theatre of warVladimir Putin warns of ‘bloodshed’ as he orders Russian forces into UkraineSolicitor caused £500,000 worth of damage after injecting his blood into supermarket foodOver-50s set to be offered Covid booster vaccines this autumnMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"living with covid plan strategy what when changes end","story":"Boris Johnson on Monday unveiled the Government\u0027s plans for how England will live with Covid in the future.The Prime Minister announced that all Covid regulations, including those that mandate lockdown and require people to self-isolate if they test positive, will be scrapped from Thursday, Feb 24.Here, we explore everything that is set to change in the days ahead. People who test positive and their close contacts will no longer be required by law to self-isolate. Anyone who receives a positive test result after Feb 24 will be advised to isolate for five days and avoid contact with vulnerable people, but will not be required to do.People who are unvaccinated and have come into close contact with a positive case will also no longer be required to isolate.The legal duty for workers to tell employers if they are required to self-isolate will also end, as will government financial support for people who are isolating.The Prime Minister said he would not wait for a total end to this war before lifting remaining measures, warning that to do so would involve restricting the liberties of the British people for a long time.From April 1, when the general public will no longer be able to access free tests, the guidance will change again to suggest that those with Covid symptoms should exercise caution to avoid spreading the virus. At a press conference, Mr Johnson suggested the UK could learn from Germany, where people are much more disciplined about not going to work if they are sick.From April 1, the Government will remove the Covid provisions on statutory sick pay, which allow employees to claim sick pay and Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) from the first day they are not at work.From March 24, the system will return to its pre-pandemic form, which allows people to claim sick pay after four days off work and ESA after seven days.Blanket lockdown regulations will also be replaced by a requirement on local authorities to manage outbreaks through planning and pre-existing public health powers, as they would with other diseases.Mr Johnson refused to rule out reintroducing restrictions in the face of a new variant in the future, saying: You\u0027ve got to be humble in the face of nature.From Feb 24, he said the Government would end routine contact tracing and no longer ask fully vaccinated close contacts to test daily for seven days.All temporary provisions of the Coronavirus Act, which enforces legal restrictions on the public, will end from March 24.The general public will no longer be able to access free lateral flow and PCR tests from the NHS from April 1.Tests are expected to be available for the over-80s and the clinically vulnerable, but the precise groups able to access them are to be decided by the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) before the April 1 deadline.Care home patients will continue to get regular free asymptomatic testing and staff will be entitled to them if symptomatic. Free diagnostic testing will continue for NHS patients, with stocks available for asymptomatic “surge” testing of staff if needed.Mr Johnson told MPs the testing, tracing and isolation budget had come at a “vast cost”, exceeding the entire budget of the Home Office in 2021, a further £15.7 billion in this financial year and £2 billion in January alone at the height of the omicron wave. He said: “We must now scale this back.”Twice weekly asymptomatic testing for staff and students in most education and childcare settings will also end from April 1. Mass testing in schools is also expected to end.The UKHSA is also working with private companies to ensure that lateral flow tests will be available in supermarkets and pharmacies when they can no longer be ordered from NHS Test and Trace for free.The Government is keen to avoid a repeat of the travel test rip-offs that saw private companies charging more than £100 for PCR tests. Ministers want to ensure there is a regulated market and see no reason why a pack of six lateral flow tests should cost more than £20.In an attempt to prevent panic buying of the kits before April 1, the Government has started rationing lateral flow tests to one pack of seven tests every three days instead of one every 24 hours.Tests for symptomatic people will be free for hospital patients, but there will not be regular asymptomatic testing on wards unless there is a local outbreak.The Government will also maintain a stockpile of tests that can be deployed if a new variant threatens to overwhelm the health service.Protection against laboratory leaks will be stepped up, said Mr Johnson as he set out a strategy to future-proof Britain against another pandemic.He said the UK Biosecurity Strategy would be refreshed to shield the country against both natural spillovers and accidental releases, as well as biological threats from other countries or terrorists. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) infection survey will also remain in place to monitor the virus, and laboratories will maintain the capability to ramp up testing to combat any new variant.But Mr Johnson made it clear that Covid would now be managed through routine public health and pharmaceutical interventions as the “first line of defence”.Vaccination will also continue into the future with the UK securing supplies of new bivalent vaccines currently in trials, which can combat multiple variants in one jab.Britain will host a global pandemic preparedness summit later this month, and is expected to sign an international treaty agreeing to ongoing surveillance.Travel tests and red tape will remain despite the relaxation of domestic restrictions.Unvaccinated travellers will still be required to take a pre-departure test and pay for a PCR test on or before day two of their arrival in the UK.All travellers – jabbed and unjabbed – will also have to continue to fill in the passenger locator form to enter the UK, to the anger of many in the travel industry and Tory MPs who have campaigned for “frictionless” travel.Grant Shapps, the Transport Secretary, is expected to announce long-term plans for travel in the next month, which could see the passenger locator form further streamlined, the scrapping of hotel quarantine for red list countries and measures to prevent a return to on-off border closures.Mr Shapps has been working with other countries to draw up a “playbook” of rules to deal with new Covid strains so action can be taken without shutting frontiers.He said this “will help us to ensure that, rather than having to shut down, we can put measures in place that are internationally agreed if required”.Following the abolition of the Covid regulations, face masks will no longer be legally compulsory anywhere.Instead, it will be left up to businesses and iniduals to decide the approach they adopt, which means companies, theatres and shops could still request that coverings are worn by employees and customers.On Monday, Sadiq Khan, the Mayor of London, said masks would no longer be compulsory on the Tube, even though officials have the power to impose them as a condition of carriage.“Following the Government dropping all legal Covid restrictions, and in light of falling infection levels in London, it is expected that wearing a face covering will no longer be a condition of carriage on the TfL network,” he said.A government source said it was “likely we won\u0027t be explicit” on the approach businesses should take to masks, adding: “We are now in a world where we’re moving away from Government diktat to personal judgement and responsibility.”Ministers will still suggest that people continue to wear face coverings in crowded and enclosed spaces where they may come into contact with people they do not normally meet in order to minimise the risk of infection.Dr Raghib Ali, a senior clinical research associate with the Medical Research Council at the University of Cambridge, urged vulnerable people to wear good quality surgical masks.Hospitals are still likely to limit visits, as living with Covid plans will leave it up to inidual trusts to decide their own policies.More than a quarter of NHS trusts have suspended routine hospital visits completely, and in some cases relatives are being prevented from seeing non-Covid patients for weeks at a time.NHS England encourages trusts to facilitate visits “wherever possible, and to do so in a risk-managed way”, but it is up to inidual trusts to set their own policies based on UK Health Security Agency guidelines.All 125 trusts have some form of visiting restriction in place. The most common policy is to have one named visitor per patient for the entirety of a patient’s stay, who can only visit for one hour once a dayMillions of over-50s could be offered Covid boosters this autumn, as Boris Johnson hailed Britain’s vaccine rollout as key to “restoring our liberties in full”.Fourth jabs will start being offered to those aged 75 and over and the clinically vulnerable from next month, with a further rollout of vaccines expected later this year, when the programme may be much more widely extended. The vaccine programme will see fourth jabs offered to those aged 75 and over from next month, around six months after their booster.  Those who are immunosuppressed will also be offered an extra jab, which for many will be their fifth dose.The Joint Committee on Vaccine and Immunisation said the extra “spring dose” would be advised for the most vulnerable ahead of the expected autumn booster programme. On Monday, the JCVI said people over 75, those living in care homes and anyone over 12 who is immunosuppressed will be offered a fourth jab. Those over 18 will be offered the Moderna or Pfizer vaccines, while those 12 to 18 will be offered Pfizer.Prof Wei Shen Lim, the JCVI chairman of Covid vaccination, said: “Last year’s booster vaccination programme has so far provided excellent protection against severe Covid-19. “To maintain high levels of protection for the most vulnerable iniduals in the population, an extra spring dose of vaccine is advised ahead of an expected autumn booster programme.“The JCVI will continue its rolling review of the vaccination programme and the epidemiological situation, particularly in relation to the timing and value of doses for less vulnerable older adults and those in clinical risk groups ahead of autumn.”Mr Johnson said that from April 1 the use of voluntarily Covid status certification would no longer be recommended but left open the possibility that they could still be used by businesses, theatres and other venues.But the Government said the pass within the NHS app for domestic purposes would only be available for a “limited period”.It will, however, continue within the NHS app for international travel to allow people to declare their vaccinated or Covid recovery status.The Prime Minister suggested companies should consider lifting work from home policies to restore public confidence after the pandemic.Full guidance for businesses is expected before April 1, when tests for the general public will no longer be free. That could include the advice that offices should consider lifting their work from home policies.The Government repealed its advice for employees to work remotely last month, but official figures from the ONS show that, by the end of January, more than a third of workers were still working from home.Virtual court hearings will become a permanent feature to clear the backlog of cases that has built up during the pandemic, despite emergency Covid laws being scrapped by the Government.More than 12,000 hearings per week have taken place across 3,200 virtual courtrooms, and the power to continue them will be transferred to a new police and crime act when remaining coronavirus laws expire in the next six months.Coroners will also be given the permanent power to carry out inquests without a jury where Covid is suspected as a cause of death.In all, 40 temporary non-devolved powers were made under coronavirus laws, of which half have already expired. Of the remaining 20, four cover the inquest and virtual court hearing provisions, and the other 16 will expire at midnight on 24 March.They include the emergency registration of nurses, healthcare workers and social workers the funding of employers’ liabilities for statutory sick pay powers in relations to the transportation, storage and disposal of dead bodies tenants’ protection from eviction and the relaxing of rules covering medical certificates for cremations.This article is being kept updated with the latest news and advice. More from NewsRussia-Ukraine crisis: UK to announce sanctions after Putin recognises breakaway regions‘Betamax’ police forces failing to recognise the digital ‘crime challenges of today’Vladimir Putin channels his inner King Lear in the Kremlin’s theatre of warVladimir Putin warns of ‘bloodshed’ as he orders Russian forces into UkraineSolicitor caused £500,000 worth of damage after injecting his blood into supermarket foodOver-50s set to be offered Covid booster vaccines this autumnMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"putins aim clear","story":"Vladimir Putin’s decision to recognise the eastern Ukrainian provinces of Donetsk and Luhansk as independent republics marks a significant heightening of tensions between Moscow and the West. The Russian leader had earlier staged an absurd propaganda stunt by chairing a televised meeting of his security council to endorse this demarche. It has removed all remaining doubt as to his intentions to further carve up Ukraine in breach of international law.The announcement has scuppered the latest flurry of diplomatic efforts spearheaded by Emmanuel Macron, who has failed to engineer the resolution to the crisis that he confidently predicted just a week or so. France currently holds the rotating EU presidency offering Mr Macron the chance to play the roles of statesman and peace-maker. He has been trying to bring the Russian leader together with US president Joe Biden in a last-ditch effort to prevent an invasion.But while Mr Biden had agreed in principle to a summit, the latest development has surely killed off any hopes of a rapprochement.While a diplomatic solution is preferable to war, it cannot be at any price, as Ben Wallace, the Defence Secretary, told MPs. The West must not support the dismantling of Ukraine in order to persuade Mr Putin to remove his troops.The provinces of Donetsk and Luhansk have been at the centre of a bloody stand-off between the two countries since 2014 that has already cost 10,000 lives. If Mr Putin can split them from Ukraine, as he did Crimea, he will consider his acts of intimidation and aggression to have been a success. But he will come back for more, with the Baltic states next on his list.More from NewsRussia-Ukraine crisis: UK to announce sanctions after Putin recognises breakaway regions‘Betamax’ police forces failing to recognise the digital ‘crime challenges of today’Vladimir Putin channels his inner King Lear in the Kremlin’s theatre of warVladimir Putin warns of ‘bloodshed’ as he orders Russian forces into UkraineSolicitor caused £500,000 worth of damage after injecting his blood into supermarket foodOver-50s set to be offered Covid booster vaccines this autumnMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"sadiq khans heads north sporting jolly london cleans storm eunice","story":"Sadiq Khan attended two sporting events with free tickets the day after London was devastated by Storm Eunice.The Mayor of London went to a football game and boxing match in the north of England just hours after the capital was battered by the storm which saw the Millennium Dome shredded by winds and one woman killed in the north of the city when a tree fell on her car.Mr Khan attended the Premier League match between Liverpool and Norwich at Anfield on Saturday afternoon before heading to Manchester to watch the fight between Kell Brook and Amir Khan at the AO Arena that night.It is understood that Mr Khan attended the match in Liverpool as a guest of the football club, while he went to the boxing as a guest of Amir Khan.It comes after it was revealed that Mr Khan had accepted over £17,000 worth of hospitality tickets over the last six months.Though the costs of Saturday’s tickets have not been made public yet, they will be declared in the Mayor’s gifts and hospitality register at a later date.Between June and November last year, Mr Khan accepted hospitality to go to events including five Euros matches, the James Bond premiere and four tickets to see Andrew Lloyd Webber’s Cinderella.On September 4, 2021, Mr Khan also accepted tickets to England’s Fourth Test against India at the Oval, three days after the launch of Operation Warm Welcome, which sought to help Afghan evacuees - thousands of which came to the capital.Dan Rosenfeld, the Prime Minister’s then-chief of staff was criticised for attending two cricket games on hospitality tickets during the evacuation of Afghanistan.Mr Rosenfeld was also criticised for going to the No Time to Die premiere during the national fuel crisis, which Mr Khan also attended and was revealed to have accepted £1,000 worth of tickets for.Mr Khan, who earns over £150,000 a year, was told that he should spend his time focusing on tackling crime in London, rather than enjoying freebies in other cities.Gareth Bacon, a London MP and former London Assembly member told the : “It seems Sadiq Khan will turn up to the opening of an envelope if there’s a photo op in it, but repeatedly refuses to take responsibility for record levels of knife crime under his watch and Transport for London in financial disarray.“Politicians are often invited to events and there is nothing wrong with accepting from time to time, but Londoners will rightly ask why the Mayor can’t put as much focus into doing his actual job as he does turning up to glitzy freebies.”London Assembly member Tony Devenish said: “Londoners wouldn\u0027t begrudge Sadiq Khan his freebies if he served the public by supporting our police to ensure crime was going down, not up, and ran Transport for London efficiently instead of causing congestion and strikes.”It comes after Mr Khan came under sustained pressure following a series of high profile interventions, including his role in the departure of Cressida Dick, the Commissioner of the politan Police.Mr Khan has threatened in recent months to shut the Tube for days on end and close bridges and tunnels across the capital following a black hole in TfL’s budget.A spokesman for the Mayor of London said: “It is the Mayor’s top priority to keep Londoners safe, which is why he has invested £1bn in policing - more than any other mayor - helping to put an extra 1,300 police officers on our streets.“As mayor of a host city for the Euros, Sadiq had an important role attending the tournament and welcoming key stakeholders from around the world to Wembley.“It is absolutely right that the Mayor is a champion of the capital’s creative and sporting sectors.“They have been devastated by the pandemic and it is a key part of the job of the Mayor to attend a range of events to support these vital sectors and the economic recovery of our city.”More from NewsRussia-Ukraine crisis: UK to announce sanctions after Putin recognises breakaway regions‘Betamax’ police forces failing to recognise the digital ‘crime challenges of today’Vladimir Putin channels his inner King Lear in the Kremlin’s theatre of warVladimir Putin warns of ‘bloodshed’ as he orders Russian forces into UkraineSolicitor caused £500,000 worth of damage after injecting his blood into supermarket foodOver-50s set to be offered Covid booster vaccines this autumnMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"sir paul mccartney set become glastonburys oldest headline act","story":"Sir Paul McCartney will become the oldest artist to headline Glastonbury when he plays the festival this summer, a week after turning 80.The singer is reportedly booked for the Pyramid stage on June 25, a week after celebrating his landmark birthday.He was due to headline the festival in 2020 but it was cancelled due to Covid. Before the cancellation Emily Eavis, the event organiser, described booking Sir Paul as “an absolute dream come true”.Sir Paul said at the time that the cancellation was the right thing to do. “One hundred thousand people closely packed together with flags and no masks - you know, talk about super-spreader,” he said.Glastonbury has not confirmed the line-up, but representatives for Sir Paul did not deny reports that he will be this year’s star name. The star recently announced a string of US dates for his Got Back tour, ending in New Jersey on June 16.Sir Paul has headlined Glastonbury once before, in 2004, when he played a 33-strong set which included a tribute to John Lennon.Although he will set a record for the oldest headline act, he is not the oldest performer to grace the festival in Pilton, Somerset.In 2015, Burt Bacharach played the Saturday afternoon Legends slot at the age of 87. BB King was 85 when he performed in 2011.The record for oldest Glastonbury headliner was last set by Charlie Watts, who was 73 when the Rolling Stones played the festival in 2013.Mr Watts was less enthusiastic about the event than Sir Paul, telling one interviewer: “I don’t want to do it. I don’t like playing outdoors and I certainly don’t like festivals.“Glastonbury, it’s old hat, really. I never liked the hippie thing to start with.”Ms Eavis, who runs the festival with her father, Michael, said last year that they planned to “throw everything at 2022” and make this year’s event one to remember.Cancelling the 2020 festival, which was the 50th anniversary year, cost the Eavises £5 million.

The Prime Minister is expected to scrap all self-isolation, even for people who have the virus, from around Thursday. He is also likely to confirm the date free lateral flow and PCR tests will be axed - although is not expected to actually happen this week. The £ self-isolation payment for low-income workers and legal powers for councils both face being scrapped. And the Mirror understands he was weighing up whether to axe sick pay from day one of Covid isolation, despite fury from unions and Labour. Scroll down for the full guide to the changes - or join the debate in the commentsFor holidaymakers, Passenger Locator Forms could be simplied further, or even scrapped completelyTransport Secretary Grant Shapps gets his way.Travel testing, however, is likely to stay for unvaccinated people entering the UK for the foreseeable future. Mr Johnson is likely to give a statement to Parliament at around .pm on Monday. He could also give a press conference. Facing pressure from Tory MPs over his leadership, the PM has decided Britain has had all the restrictions it can tolerate. Speaking before his announcement on Monday, the Prime Minister said: Today will mark a moment of pride after one of the most dficult periods in our countryaposs history as we begin to learn to live with Covid. It would not be possible without the efforts of so many - the NHS who delivered the le-saving vaccine rollout at phenomenal speed, our world-leading scientists and experts, and the general public for their commitment to protecting themselves and their loved ones. The pandemic is not over but thanks to the incredible vaccine rollout we are now one step closer towards ato normality and finally giving people back their freedoms while continuing to protect ourselves and others.It comes after ministers confirmed all children over five will be able to get the Covid vaccine from April. But charities worry millions of vulnerable or immunocompromised Brits will be thrown to the wolves with little support.And the governmentaposs own scientic advisors have warned ending testing and isolation could trigger a rapid rise in cases. Here’s everything we know about what is likely to be announced.Self-isolation laws scrappedLegal Covid self-isolation is due to be scrapped - evenyou currently have the virus - from as soon as Thursday  February. The decision will end almost exactly two years of legally-enforced isolation for people who test positive. But it raises ethical dilemmas about whether to go to work and put others at risk, especiallyyou can no longer claim a £ isolation payment or sick pay from day one . Despite scrapping legal isolation, No said: “We’re not saying isolation is pointless. We’d expect anyone with an infectious disease to take steps not to spread that disease further - a colleague at work with flu, for example. Currently people who test positive must go into self-isolation for at least five full days in England, a period that has been repeatedly cut from  days and seven days. Fears Statutory Sick Pay will be stripped back Boris Johnson has been weighing up whether to scrap sick pay from day one of Covid illness, the Mirror understands.£.-a-week Statutory Sick Payis usually only available from the fourth day of any illness, after three ‘waiting days’ are complete. This was cut to the first day in  for people isolating due to Covid. Ministers said the move was “vital” to ensure people get help and follow the rules.But the power is contained in the Coronavirus Act, which is currently due to expire on March .That means it could be removed, even though No has advised people who are sick with the virus to stay away from work. TUC General Secretary Frances O’Grady said: “It’s vital that sick pay remains a day one right and is made available to all. Workers who are laid low by Covid must be able to make ends meet – not pushed into financial hardship.”A date for scrapping free lateral flow testsBoris Johnson’s plan is expected to set a timetable for the end of free lateral flow tests, with people having to pay instead.The government warned last summer it would eventually stop paying for these rapid tests due to the huge cost of the NHS.Sources told the Mirror that claims the tests themselves will end this week are wide of the mark. However, the Living with Covid plan could set a date in the future for when they are cut off. It’s not known how much lateral flow tests will cost, but estimates have put it at £ for a pack of seven. A date for scrapping free PCR tests and Test and TraceIt’s thought the plan may contain a date for ending free ‘gold standard’ PCR tests as England’s Covid infrastructure is wound down. Whitehall sources told thethe Treasury is trying to cut the £bn-a-year cost, which will mean having to phase out free testing and all but ending the contact-tracing system. Scientists have raised the alarm about ending these free tests, with reports suggesting they could cost £ each privately. According to reports, only health and social care workers and .million vulnerable people will continue to get free PCRs. Prof Lawrence Young of Warwick University said: “Living with Covid doesn’t mean letting our guard down”. Covid travel Passenger Locator Form could be simplied or axed Fully-vaccinated people entering the UK do not need to take any Covid tests, under changes that happened on February . But they still need to fill in a Passenger Locator Form - albeit a ‘simplied’ one - and further changes to this are possible in this week’s Covid plan. It’s understood the Department for Transport was pressing to further simply the Passenger Locator Form - or get rid of it completely. It is thought there was only a slim chance of the form being axed altogether, as health officials were still worried about needing to track new iants coming in to the UK. Meanwhile, unvaccinated people still need to take one pre-departure test and one post-arrival test before entering the UK. It’s understood this rule will stay for the foreseeable future and no changes to it are due this week. £ self-isolation payment could be scrappedThe £ self-isolation payment for poor workers with Covid could end as the legal requirement to quarantine is scrapped. The Test and Trace Support Payment was introduced in September  to help low-wage workers afford to self-isolate for up to  days. No final decisions have been announced yet over the future of the £ payment, and its status was being considered by the government last week.  Legal powers for councils will goLegal changes will end remaining powers councils had under the  Coronavirus Act in England to close some venues. However, these powers were barely ever used, because powers for lockdowns flow from a separate law passed in . And the vast majority of Coronavirus Act powers - including on detention, events, gatherings, shops and restaurants and schools - already expired in September . Only a few of the more draconian powers - including the power to suspend port operations - remained in the Act. Vaccines for all children over five All children over five will be able to get vaccinated against Covid- from April. The “non-urgent offer” to the parents of nearly six million - year olds was confirmed by the Government moments after advice issued by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation . Two smaller doses of the Pfizer jab,  weeks apart, will be available to this age group to help control future Covid waves after Covid curbs have been lted. It is understood there are no plans for a major publicity drive to encourage this age group to be vaccinated and it will be left very much up to parents to decide. Itaposs understood a rollout for over-s will be less urgent than previous vaccine drives, due to the very low risk Covid poses to younger kids. The idea is that ordinary NHS care shouldn’t be interrupted to give kids the jab, like it was for adults. All children over  have been able to get the Pfizer Covid jab since September last year. Currently, only the most vulnerable kids aged  to  are eligible. They are offered two jabs but at a lower dose than for adults -  micrograms instead of .

The Electoral Commission urged the government to axe parts of the Elections Bill, which it says will allow governments to muzzle the independent regulator and influence its “operational s and decision-making” and. In a letter to the Levelling Up Secretary on Monday, commissioners warn the introduction of a new “strategy and policy statement” for the watchdog gives ministers power over “oversight and enforcement of the political finance regime” and the guidance to political parties and campaigners.It comes after an Electoral Commission investigation resulted in the Conservative Party being fined £, for failing to properly declare a Tory peer’s £, donation to cover lavish refurbishments to the Prime Minister’s Downing Street flat.“It would thereby provide a mechanism, driven by the then governing party, enabling that party’s ministers to shape how electoral law is applied to them and their political competitors,” the commissioners said of the new policy statement.  “While the stated position of the current government is that it would not intend to use these powers to impact on the commission’s independent oversight and regulation of the electoral system, no such assurances can be given about how the broad scope of these powers would be used over time. “Strong accountability is essential for this, but so too is demonstrable independence. The commission’s independent role in the electoral system must be clear for voters and campaigners to see, and preserved in electoral law.”Deputy Labour leader Angela Rayner, meanwhile, accused Boris Johnson of “rigging our democracy for himself”.The letter – signed by nine of  of the commissioners, less Tory-nominated Lord Gilbert due to his role in the Lords – urged ministers to “think again about these measures” and to “remove the provisions” under question. Ms Rayner said: “The Elections Bill is anti-democratic in so many ways. “Attacking institutions, allowing unchecked foreign money into British democracy, and disenfranchising so many people. “Boris Johnson is rigging our democracy for himself.” The legislation, which also includes controversial plans to introduce voter ID, has been backed by MPs and will this week be debated by the House of Lords. A Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities spokesperson said: “We completely disagree with the Electoral Commission’s claims about the Elections Bill - our reforms will not affect their operational independence.“The Pickles review on electoral fraud was clear that reforms were needed to improve accountability. Making the Electoral Commission more accountable will strengthen the integrity of the electoral process and help prevent fraud.”Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Electoral CommissionConservative PartyBoris JohnsonMichael GovePolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

It comes following a flurry of late-night calls between French President Emmanuel Macron and Mr Putin. Mr Macronaposs office and the White House said details of a possible summit could be hammered out during a meeting on Thursday between US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov. The development offers a glimmer of hope of a diplomatic solution but Western leaders still fear a Russian invasion of Ukraine could be imminent.More than , Russian troops are massed around Ukraineaposs borders, according to US estimates, with , along the countryaposs eastern flank and tens of thousands alongside Belarusian troops in the north.Fears have been mounting that Russia will stage  flag attacks to justy further aggression against Ukraine. A UK source told the Mirror that they believed an invasion was going to happen in the next  to  hours.  Boris Johnson warned at the weekend that Europe could be on the brink of the biggest war since  as he travelled to Munich for a crunch security conference.In a call with Mr Macron on Sunday night, the Prime Minister welcomed the prospect of a diplomatic solution and urged Mr Putin to step back from his current threats and withdraw troops from Ukraine’s border. A No spokesperson said: “The Prime Minister noted that President Putin’s commitments to President Macron were a welcome sign that he might still be willing to engage in finding a diplomatic solution. The Prime Minister stressed that Ukraine’s voice must be central in any discussions. Tory Minister Paul Scully said there were , more Russian troops on the Ukrainian border than there were a few days ago despite the Russians trying to signal the fact they were pulling away from the border.He told Sky News: There is a very, very credible threat and thataposs why weaposve got to continue to be vigilant, weaposve got to continue to work with Ukraine and Poland, as Liz Truss, the Foreign Secretary, was doing just this week.

Mandatory self-isolation will be axed from Thursday, £ isolation payments and Day One sick pay will go, and free tests will be axed from April  - with a -hour limit already in place to stop stockpiling. The Prime Minister said testing, tracing and isolation cost £bn in January alone adding: Those who would wait for a total end to this war... would be restricting the liberties of the British people for a long time to come.But the SNP said he was scrambling to save his own skin from Tory MPs angry about Partygate, while Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said: This is a half-baked announcement from a Government paralysed by chaos and incompetence.It is not a plan to live well with Covid.Phillip Anderson, Head of Policy at the MS Society, warned over , immunocompromised people do not know how they can live safely alongside the virus.Lobby Akinnola, spokesperson for Covid- Bereaved Families for Justice, said: People will die directly because of the decision to scrap free testing, and those deaths are avoidable. Just as the Government was late starting testing, costing thousands of lives, they are going to be too early finishing it, with the same consequence.The Scottish and Welsh governments are furious as No confirmed neither they, nor the NHS in England, will get new money for testing beyond April.The refusal to give any extra money prompted a last-minute delay to the plan after a row at the highest levels of government. Hereaposs what was announced today and what it means for you.February : Testing advice ends in schoolsEngland’s guidance for staff and students in schools to do regular lateral flow testing is being removed immediately. They may remain for some settings like special schools but details were not immediately available. Guidance previously said: Staff and secondary school pupils should continue to test twice weekly at home, with lateral flow devicetest kits, - days apart. Testing remains voluntary but is strongly encouraged. February : Limit on how many tests you can getAs of today you can no longer get more than one box of lateral flow tests in a -hour period. It was previously a  hour period. This is to stop a rush of people stockpiling them before April , when free tests end .February : Self-isolation laws scrappedMandatory Covid self-isolation in England will be scrapped - evenyou have the virus - from .am on Thursday  February. The decision will end almost exactly two years of legally-enforced isolation for people who test positive. The legal obligation to tell your employeryou have to self-isolate will also end.But adults and children will still beadvisedto stay at homethey test positive.Between Thursday and the end of March, youaposll be advised to isolate for five days as long as you test negative twice,  hours apart at the end of that period - as is the case now. New advicewill apply from April . That raises ethical dilemmas about whether to go to work and put others at risk, especially as you can no longer claim a £ isolation payment or sick pay from day one . Despite scrapping legal isolation, No earlier said: “We’re not saying isolation is pointless. We’d expect anyone with an infectious disease to take steps not to spread that disease further - a colleague at work with flu, for example. February : Close contacts no longer have to test or isolateThe government will no longer ask vaccinated or child contacts of Covid cases in England to test themselves for  days. It will also remove the legal requirement for unvaccinated close contacts to self isolate, all from .am on Thursday.February : £ self-isolation payment scrappedThe £ self-isolation payment for poor workers with Covid will end from .am on Thursday.The Test and Trace Support Payment was introduced in September  to help low-wage workers afford to self-isolate for up to  days. Unions and Labour are worried its removal will force people to go to work, putting their colleagues at risk of infection.The medicine delivery service will no longer be available. February : Routine contact-tracing and council powers endRoutine contact-tracing will end in England as the UKaposs infrastructure for dealing with Covid is wound down. So will a set of domestic laws - the Health Protectionregulations - which gave councils powers to enact closures in their area.March : Sick pay and ESA from day one will endPeople who fall ill with Covid will no longer be eligible for immediate aposDay Oneapos sick pay from March . The law willto how it was before Covid, where you donapost get SSP for the first three days youaposre ill and only get it from Day Four. The same will happen to Employment and Support Allowancewhich willfrom Day One to Day Eight. People will no longer be eligible for ESAisolating due to Covid. Itaposs despite widespread calls for the Government to boost statutory sick pay - which is currently £.-a-week - so those struggling financially are not tempted to go back to work. TUC General Secretary Frances O’Grady said: “The government is creating needless hardship and taking a sledgehammer to public health. The failure to provide decent sick pay to all – from the first day of illness - is reckless and self-defeating. Dan Shears of the GMB union said: “Today’s nonsensical announcement guarantees workers will attend the workplace with Covid. Restoring the three day limit is an act of national self-sabotage.April : Free lateral flow tests for the general public will endFrom April  the vast majority of people must paythey want a lateral flow test - eventhey have a cough and fever. No has said spending £bn a month on free tests is not an effective use of taxpayers’ money at this point. This has prompted a furious row with Labour, some medics and the Scottish and Welsh governments - which will get no new moneythey want to continue free tests. It’s not known how much lateral flow tests will cost, but No is seeking a regulated market where each test costs a low single-figure number of pounds. This suggests a box of seven could cost £-.Asymptomatic tests for NHS workers will be made available but not routinely, only as a surge effort where thereaposs an outbreak. But they will be available for care home residents. Exact lists of those eligible are being drawn up.UNISON general secretary Christina McAnea said: “The government has taken leave of its senses. Ditching every last Covid safety rule while thousands are still catching the virus every day is irresponsible. “Ending free tests for the public is a foolish move. Most people will simply stop testing because they can’t afford to check their Covid status. April : Free PCR tests will end for the vast majorityThe capacity to do hundreds of thousands of aposgold standardapos PCR tests a day will be wound down dramatically from April  in England. Youaposll no longer be able to order a free PCRyou have symptoms and go to a walk-in or drive-through centre, or get it in the post. There will be some exceptions to this, including the over-s, the immunosuppressed, and patients on NHS wards. Exact lists of those eligible are still being drawn up. Scientists have raised the alarm about ending these free tests, with reports suggesting they could cost £ each privately. Some of the UKaposs lab capacity for PCR tests will be maintained, but not all of it. UKHSA are determining precisely what right level is, to ensure there’s enough to scale upthere’s a new iant. The network of testing centres is already being scaled back and will continue to be reduced. April : New guidance for workplaces and Covid passes wound downThe legal need for firms to consider Covid- in risk assessments will be removed, except- for example - they are a lab that handles the virus. The Government will replace the existing set of ‘Working Safely’ guidance with new public health guidance. The plan says: Employers should continue to consider the needs of employees at greater risk from COVID-, including those whose immune system means they are at higher risk of serious illness from COVID-. The Government will consult with employers and businesses to ensure guidance continues to support them to manage the risk of COVID- in workplaces. The plan adds: From  April, the Government will remove the current guidance on domestic voluntary COVID-status certication and will no longer recommend that certain venues use the NHS COVID Pass. The NHS COVID Pass will remain available within the NHS App for a limited period. People will continue to be able to access their vaccination status for international travel.Date TBC: End of mandatory masks on Londonaposs public transport London Mayor Sadiq Khan said he expects rules on wearing face coverings on the Transport for London network will be lted following the Governmentaposs announcements.Following the Government dropping all legal Covid restrictions, and in light of falling infection levels in London, it is expected that wearing a face covering will no longer be a condition of carriage on the TfL network, he said. However, we know that face coverings remain a simple, effective measure that give Londoners confidence to travel, and following clear advice from public health advisers, TfL will likely continue to recommend their use on the network.Staying in place: Covid travel rules Fully-vaccinated people entering the UK do not need to take any Covid tests, under changes that happened on February . But they still need to fill in a Passenger Locator Form - albeit a ‘simplied’ one - and no further changes have been announced today. It’s understood the Department for Transport was pressing to further simply the Passenger Locator Form - or get rid of it completely. But this has not yet come to pass. Meanwhile, unvaccinated people still need to take one pre-departure test and one post-arrival test before entering the UK. It’s understood this rule will stay for the foreseeable future and no changes to it are due this week. There will be a review of these rules before Easter.  Staying in place: Surveillance and surge powersOfficials said the government will maintain strong domestic surveillance, including the ONS Covid infection survey to spot new iants, and the Siren and Vivaldi studies.There will also be measures to ramp up testing in the NHSneeded in future. SAGE experts have already warned a new iant could be more deadly than the original form of Covid - rather than less deadly, like Omicron. From Spring: A fourth dose of vaccine for over-s and the vulnerablePeople over  and the clinically vulnerable will be offered another Covid jab from the Spring. A second booster jab has been recommended for over-s by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation , which applies to around . million people. It will also be offered to around , immunosuppressed people, some of whom have already had a third dose and a booster. Anyone eligible can come forward to get another vaccine regardless of whether they have had three of four doses - as long as there has been a six month gap since their last jab. Vaccine experts are also planning for a wider booster programme for more of the population in the autumn. The JCVI said it will confirm which sections of the population would qualy for this nearer the time.Health Secretary Sajid Javid has accepted the recommendations for fourth doses, which is a “precautionary strategy to maintain high levels of immunity”.The extra spring dose is advised around six months after the last vaccine dose for over-s, those living in an elderly care home and anyone aged over  who is immunosuppressed.From April: Vaccines for all children over five All children over five will be able to get vaccinated against Covid- from April. The “non-urgent offer” to the parents of nearly six million - year olds was confirmed by the Government moments after advice issued by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation . Two smaller doses of the Pfizer jab,  weeks apart, will be available to this age group to help control future Covid waves after Covid curbs have been lted. It is understood there are no plans for a major publicity drive to encourage this age group to be vaccinated and it will be left very much up to parents to decide. Itaposs understood a rollout for over-s will be less urgent than previous vaccine drives, due to the very low risk Covid poses to younger kids. The idea is that ordinary NHS care shouldn’t be interrupted to give kids the jab, like it was for adults. All children over  have been able to get the Pfizer Covid jab since September last year. Currently, only the most vulnerable kids aged  to  are eligible. They are offered two jabs but at a lower dose than for adults -  micrograms instead of .

Its p spaghetti is, like the proleration of food banks in the UK, a treatment of the symptom of poverty.We need to address the cause. The responsibility for the welfare and wellbeing of our most vulnerable citizens should not rest on the shoulders of charities, nor supermarkets. It’s easy to paint the large ­corporations as the villains, but questions need to be asked as to why people need p spaghetti and p pasta to survive in one of the richest economies in the world.  And the answers lie squarely at the well-heeled feet of those who have held the purse strings and policies of the country for the last  long and dismal years. Those years of austerity cuts to social care and health services mean the safety net of a decent and supportive society is less than threadbare. The triple threat of rocketing food prices, unmanageable energy bills, and an underfunded National Health Service is going to cause long-term damage to families, communities, and ­iniduals in almost every ­neighbourhood in the country. Every area now has at least one foodbank we live in a society where people need the ad-hoc macro philanthropy of neighbours and strangers to not starve to death.  Over the last two years of the pandemic, the Chancellor has proven time and again that he can magic up a whole orchard of flourishing and evergreen money trees when it comes to propping up his pet projects. Writing off £.billion of furlough fraud, £.billion “lost” down the back of the Downing Street couch, supposedly spent on PPE nobody has any record of, not even the company that received the payment. That money alone could have paid for TWO YEARS of the continuation of the £ uplt to Universal Credit. Somehow there is always money for crony contracts, Parliamentary p*ss-ups, weaponry and warfare, and DWP cover-ups, because it comes at the expense of social care, school dinners, and starving pensioners. So while I welcome the ­reappearance of budget groceries on the supermarket shelves as an ­immediate-term relief for millions of people struggling to make ends meet, and while I will continue to write recipes for p a head and publish them for free on my website, I’m determined that we work towards building a world where neither of those things are essential any more. As the late, great Archbishop Desmond Tutu once said: “It isn’t enough to simply keep pulling people out of the river.

Truss confirmed the plan in a tweet today, writing: Tomorrow we will be announcing new sanctions on Russia in response to their breach of international law and attack on Ukraineaposs sovereignty and territorial integrity. The confirmation tomorrow comes after president Vladimir Putin delivered a stirring statement today, in which he said it was historical fact that Ukraine is in Russia.  During the speech, which was broadcast on Russia , he painted todayaposs Ukraine as a modern construct that is inextricably linked to Russia. He then went on to say Russia has every right to protect its security.Putin also signed a decree recognising the independence of two breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine, Donetsk and Luhansk, with the move widely seen as upping the ante in a crisis that could soon turn into war.Prime Minister Boris Johnson condemned the recognition as a breach of international law during a Downing Street press conference this evening.He said: I gather just as I came into this press conference that Vladimir Putin has effectively announced that Russia is recognising the breakaway republics of Donetsk and Lugansk.This is plainly in breach of international law. Itaposs a ... flagrant violation of the sovereignty and integrity of Ukraine.  It is a repudiation of the Minsk process and the Minsk agreements, and I think itaposs a very ill omen and a very dark sign. Truss also said the move violated the U.N. Charter and signalled an end to the Minsk process - a set of agreements designed to end a separatist war by Russian speakers in eastern Ukraine. She said in a statement: We will coordinate our response will allies. We will not allow Russiaaposs violation of its international commitments to go unpunished. Johnson is due to speak with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Monday.When asked earlierit was now time to impose sanctions on Russia, Johnson said he would have to wait and see what happened in eastern Ukraine.  He said: What I have said before about the package of sanctions is that they will be triggered with the first toecap of a Russian incursion or Russian invasion. But plainly what has happened is extremely bad news. It is becoming clear that weaposre going to need to start applying as much pressure as we possibly can because it is hard to see how this situation improves.

If today, you were constructing the best model for a European trade organisation, would it resemble the bloated, bureaucratic, monolith run by unelected, mediocre, pro-German civil servants called the EU  And more than half the country, predominantly older people staunchly proud of Britain’s history and its ­constitutional monarchy, thought not. Well, I’d like to ask them,they were constructing a model British state today, would they have a Windsor at the head of it  Park this year’s fairy-tale narrative about the past seven decades being one long, glorious reign, and focus on the past few days. The heir to the throne faces a police investigation over claims his advisers fixed a CBE for a Saudi tycoon who had given a fortune to one of his charities. Charles denies any knowledge of a deal but can’t deny secretly meeting the tycoon in Saudi Arabia, welcoming him to Clarence House, and giving him the CBE at Buckingham Palace.  The Queen’s second oldest son has just agreed a reported £million payoff to a woman who claimed he raped her when she was , as a minor under US law, which he denies. In fact he denies ever meeting her. So we’re expected to believe he’s just given £million to a complete stranger. And the royals won’t denysome of his hush money comes from the Queen’s Duchy of Lancaster tax-deductible fund. Which would effectively mean taxpayers crowdfunding the Duke of York’s escape route from a child sex scandal. He still retains that title, despite York MP Rachael Maskell demanding it be removed after a poll claimed % of York citizens don’t want him shaming their city. He will also remain a Queen’s ­Counsellor of State. I can’t wait to hear how he counsels her on legislation about sex trafficking. The views of York’s citizens are deemed irrelevantbecause in our monarchical system, subjects cannot question royals. I would love to hear MPs debate the issues around Charles and Andrew, and how much, and for how long, the Queen knew of her son’s connections to his convicted paedophile friend. And the morality behind Buckingham Palace finally ordering Andrew to settle the allegations against him to save the precious Platinum Jubilee. But our elected representatives cannot mention such issues in the Commons, just as we can’t see how much royals leave in their wills, because as Parliamentary bible Erskine May states: “No question can be put which brings the name of the Sovereign or the ­influence of the Crown directly before Parliament, or which casts reflections upon the ­Sovereign or the Royal Family.” Hence why MPs are forced to take an oath of allegiance to the monarch and all their heirs. What a ludicrous, humiliating stitch-up. All to keep these accidents of birth ruling over us. And to think, most Brits believe the EU is an anti-democratic gravy train which keeps charlatans in clover, while our “democracy” is the envy of the world. I’d love to think this week will convince royalists that this family they idolise is not only not better than theirs, some of its members are far worse. And we should bin the whole feudal farce once the Queen dies. But I’d be kidding myself.

At the time of writing, four people are known to have lost their lives. However, staying home isn’t an option for everyone. For some people, a car journey cannot be avoided -this is you, read on for top expert tips on how to stay safe on the roads during the storms. How to drive safely in a storm  Follow these top tips for navigating the roads in the storms. Watch out for fallen treesSpeaking to HullLive, CEO of MotorEasy Duncan McClure Fisher, said: “Storms pose a real threat to le for many reasons, but one of the main ones is felled trees blocking roads.“This is especially true in rural areas where suddenly encountering a fallen tree around a sharp corner on a country lane could lead to a serious accident and pose a major risk to le. “But there is something to watch out for that can act as a vital early warning system for any trouble ahead. “And that is seeing lots of twigs and leaves on the road as this could be an indication that the wind has caused signicant damage to trees and other foliage in the area.Claims firm The Compensation Experts, have provided some top tips for staying safe on the roads in stormy conditions.Check the forecast before you travel It might sound obvious, but knowing what is going to be ahead of you before you head out is winter driving . Make sure you check a forecast before setting off - with live updates and to the minute predictions knowing what to expect on your journey has never been easier. Maintain a safe distance Stormy conditions can come with added rain, snow or ice – all of which will massively increase the distance your car needs to stop. To mitigate this dangerous factor, ensure you leave plenty of space between you and the car in front so that in an emergency you can stop fully without hitting them. Approach junctions intending to stop before you get there, because, as per the Highway Code, stopping distances can be  times the distance in icy conditions. Keep your gears high  Driving in a high gear will help you maintain better control of your vehicle -you are finding it hard to get your motor moving, try shting up to second gear to pull away. Use your lights Before you head off, make sure your lights are working as well as possible. Your car might also have some automatic light settings that,fairly new, you might not know about. Learn about these and how to override themnecessary. Get your tyre pressures just right  With grip lowered in winter itaposs important your tyres are fighting fit.

Winter tyres may also be handy for people living in snowy parts of the country. Driving in a flood The RAC say that when navigating deep water it is important to size it up first.The rescue firm says it is worth getting out of your vehicle, evenit means you have to stop your car and get out . If the water is muddy you might not be able to see the bottom and gauge its depth. Try and find a stick or an object to find the lowest point. If the water is too deep or youaposre not sure about it then it is always best to try to go around. If you decide it is shallow enough to drive through make sure there are no objects in the water that could damage your vehicle. The RAC added: Once you’ve confirmed you can drive through the puddle and determined your route, keep your vehicle in a low gearand engine revs up. This will help you maintain momentum when you travel through the puddle, creating a bow wave so you don’t get bogged down. Creating a small bow wave can be good for helping you to move forward but donapost go too quickly, otherwise, the water can rush back into your caraposs engine. Once you exit the other side – and especiallythe puddle is on the deep side – pause for a momentyou can to let any excess water drain away and flow back to where it came from. Make sure you check your brakes after driving through deep water.

If you sell goods to the EU, or buy goods from the EU and bring them into the UK, you need to be able to prove that they meet the new rules of origin requirements to access preferential tarfs. It’s vital you understand the new rules to keep your business moving. To benefit from the preferential tarfs, you must have proof that any goods you import from the EU originate there, or any goods you export to the EU originate in the UK. Proof of origin can either be a statement of origin completed by the exporter, or evidence of the importer’s knowledge of where products originate. If you cannot prove the origin, you or your EU customer may be liable to pay the full rate of customs duty and could face penalties. Andrew Macleod, founder of London-based restaurant brand Emilia’s Crafted Pasta, explains that imports from the EU are vital to his brand: “We import ingredients directly from Italy, including special cured meats, cheeses, drinks and alcohol. Each of our suppliers is hand-picked.”  Has he had to make any changes to his business now that there are new import rules in place  “Yes – of course we already knew the origin of all the goods we import as we source everything carefully. But we’ve trained two of our managers on the rules around importing, so we know that we have staff in house who are well versed in the process.”  And having successfully navigated the changes, what advice would Andrew offer other businesses that import  “We found using a customs agent really helps the process run smoothly, but it’s equally important that you understand the rules yourself,” he says. “It’s not too late, and the gov.uk site has lots of valuable information.”  You must be able to prove the origin of any product you import You can choose to work with a freight forwarder or courier To benefit from preferential tarfs, you must be able to prove that any goods you import originated in the EU Note:you’re moving goods between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, rules of origin work dferently.

Here is the latest data: Infections Around one in  people in private households in England had Covid- in the week to February , or . million people, according to estimates from the Office for National Statistics . This is down from one in , or . million people, in the week to February . Infections are still higher than they were before Christmas, when the estimate stood at one in , or two million people. But levels have fallen since the peak of the Omicron wave at the start of the year, when a record one in  in England had Covid- - the equivalent of . million people.The ONS infection survey is the most reliable measure of the prevalence of coronavirus across the country. It is based on a representative sample of swab tests collected from tens of thousands of households, and is therefore able to estimate the percentage of people likely to test positive for Covid- at any one point in time - regardless of when they caught the virus, how many times they have had it and whether they have symptoms. By contrast, the number of cases of Covid- announced each day by the Government counts only those people who have reported themselves as testing positive for the virus, and as such is affected by how many people are coming forward for tests or who are taking a test because they know they have coronavirus symptoms. Hospital patients Although infections in England hit a record high during the recent Omicron surge, the number of people in hospital with Covid- never came close to matching levels seen in the second wave of the virus a year ago.Patient numbers reached , on January   - around a half the , recorded on January   at the peak of the second wave, according to NHS England figures.The total currently stands at ,, having fallen by  per cent in the past week and down  per cent from the Omicron peak. An estimated , Covid- hospital admissions among people aged  and over were prevented in England between December   and February   due to the direct effect of the booster vaccination campaign, according to the UK Health Security Agency.  Just over half of all Covid- patients in hospital trusts in England are now being treated primarily for something , up from a quarter in the autumn of last year. All patients who have tested positive for Covid- need to be treated separately from those who do not have the virus, regardless of whether they are in hospital primarily for Covid or not. But the growing proportion of patients who are in hospital with Covid- rather than for Covid- is another sign that the current wave of the virus has not led to the same sort of pressure on critical care as in previous waves. Antibodies An estimated . per cent of people aged  and over in England were likely to have Covid- antibodies in the week ending January  , according to the ONS. This is up from . per cent six months earlier and just  per cent in mid-January . The presence of Covid- antibodies suggests someone has had the infection in the past or has been vaccinated. It takes between two and three weeks after infection - or vaccination - for the human body to make enough antibodies to fight the virus.  Antibodies then remain in the blood at low levels, although these levels can decline over time to the point where tests can no longer detect them. The latest ONS figure of . per cent is the highest since estimates began in December  and is likely to reflect both the impact of the vaccination rollout and the high prevalence of Covid- in recent months. Some . per cent of children in England aged  to  are also estimated to have antibodies, along with . per cent of eight to -year-olds. Only a tiny number of children aged eight to  outside clinical trials had received any Covid- vaccine at the time the estimates were made, meaning almost everyone in this age group with antibodies will have them due to a coronavirus infection. By contrast, first doses of Covid- vaccine have been available for  to -year-olds in England since September last year, with jabs being offered in schools as well as local vaccination centres. Vaccinations Take-up of Covid- vaccines in England has always ied across dferent age groups and this remains the case in the latest available Government figures. Around nine in  adults aged  and over have received at least three doses of vaccine. The proportion then falls as the age groups get younger.  Take-up of boosters or third doses of vaccine has yet to reach  per cent among any group under , with the figure estimated to be just . per cent for  to -year-olds and  per cent for  to -year-olds. The very high prevalence of the virus at the start of the year will have meant many people were unable to get an extra jab, as vaccines cannot be given to anybody who has tested positive within the previous  days. But despite infection levels falling in recent weeks, as yet there is no sign that take-up of boosters among young adults is starting to accelerate. Deaths The number of deaths in England where Covid- was recorded on the death certicate averaged between  and  a day during January , according to the ONS. This is far below the equivalent figures for January , when deaths per day averaged between  to ,. While deaths in recent weeks have been higher than much of the second half of last year, the impact of the vaccine rollout is clear.  There has not been the kind of surge in deaths during the Omicron wave that occurred in the first and second waves of Covid-, despite Omicron being a highly transmissible iant of the virus. Vaccine effectiveness against mortality with the Omicron iant for people aged  and over is estimated to be  per cent at two or more weeks after a booster jab, compared with around  per cent at -plus weeks after a second dose, according to the UK Health Security Agency. As of January  , , deaths had occurred in England where Covid- was mentioned on the death certicate, either as the main cause or a contributory factor, the ONS said. The highest number on a single day was , on January  . During the first wave of the virus, the daily toll peaked at , on April  . Around nine in  deaths with Covid- on the death certicate since the start of the pandemic have coronavirus as the primary cause of death, with a minority listing the virus as a contributory factor.

Lisa Gillibrand, , and her hubby Kit Wong, , claim they first paid the self-employed trader to complete their garden extension last March, initially handing over £, for supplies. Kit claims he then began a three-month game of cat and mouse where he was forced to repeatedly chase the builder and only a small amount of work was completed. The couple had been told the work would take around a month to complete but they were forced to face a stressful time while Lisa underwent IVF. When the builder allegedly disappeared in May, the aposbetrayedapos couple claim they discovered half-built, unsafe walls with the cavities stuffed with fast food packaging. Have you been hit by rogue traders  Email webnews@mirror with your storyNow almost a year since they handed over the first chunk of cash, the clothing business owners are still out of pocket by more £, and have been forced to abandon their hopes of a purpose-built extension altogether. When asked about the event, the builder was defiant and said the couple would have to take him to court to get the cash back as he feels heaposs done enough work to warrant it. Kit, from Widnes in Cheshire, said: It was totally stressful. It was during lockdown so we couldnapost get away from it all. Because [the building] was for our growing business we were worried it was going to be heavily affected, which it was in the end as we had to fork out another £, to rent a storeroom around October on a build which was supposed to be finished in April. I felt betrayed and upset as we were giving him the benefit of the doubt and being very accommodating to him, [offering] cold drinks and food.When he was just giving us excuses after excuses and looking back now, knowing he was never going to give us the materials we had paid upfront for and never going to finish the build. Iaposm angry to have let that man onto our property. Almost a year ago, Kit and Lisa were enduring a stressful IVF journey and desperate to create more space in their home so reached out to a local builder, claiming aposnothing seemed strangeapos at first. Kit said: At first, he was really professional and said he could do everything we wanted. He gave us a quote on a letterhead - nothing seemed strange. He said heaposd require a deposit for the materials up front. It was £,. As soon as we paid, he was a totally dferent person.It was very ropey. He said aposIaposm going to start on this dateapos [in March] then it came to that date and I was like aposwhere are you apos. He was giving me loads of excuses. There was a couple of weeksapos delay initially and one of the reasons was a family emergency, then one of the team had Covid. We started to get quite nervous because weaposd handed over a lot of money and they werenapost turning up. Finally, there was one day where they actually did turn up. They turned up with a few lads and he literally came with a pile of bricks. Weaposd just paid £, so we wondered where the materials were. He said we couldnapost fit them in the garden, or put them anywhere. If he knew that from the start, why make us pay up front This was a three to four-week build and we were already two weeks in. Theyaposd just taken down the old outbuilding and there was no chance of them finishing it in the original time frame and we still had no materials. We were getting worried and saying all he was doing was bringing bricks. On  March, he asked for another payment for labour of £,. When he was requesting money, he was on it. I remember we were shopping and I said aposwhen Iaposm back home, Iaposll send you the paymentapos and he was calling me. In the background of this, I was like aposwhereaposs the nice doors we ordered apos  Eventually, the couple managed to get the builder on site and claim the walls were going up, but the work soon tapered off and the weather-conscious worker began claiming it was raining too much to work. Soon, Kit claims he went off the radar and they struggled to reach him.Kit said: We were chasing him. He was then making excuses about the weather.We sent calls, emails and texts. It got to the point where he actually said aposKit, I can see Widnes from the house. I can see itaposs raining so Iaposm not comingapos. It was actually sunny. It shocked us because we thought it was quite rude. I then started taking a weather log to prove it wasnapost raining. Admittedly, there were a couple of days it rained but out of the three to four weeks he said he couldnapost come, it didnapost rain all that time. There was no reason for him not to be there. The pair then called building regulations to investigate the work so far but claim they were told it was aposunsafeapos as the walls aposwerenapost even tied inapos. Kit said: Heaposs put up the walls. One side was the height itaposs meant to be on, the other sides arenapost. We hired building regs to come and check it out. They said the walls werenapost even tied in or anything so it was unsafe. You could push it down. He did a terrible job which meantwe were to fix it, those walls have to come down. On April , we sent a text to express our concerns as over £, was paid and weaposd only had four days of work. There was no skip or cement on site. We were to-ing and fro-ing until the end of the May [th]. He was pushed back the date repeatedly. This goes on from the first time we paid. After the very first payment of that £,, me and Lisa are chasing him. You chase him, he comes and does a bit, then you have to chase him again. He then asks for further payment. Heaposs turning up, itaposs just one day out of a week. Heaposs not getting a good run on it. Basically, from the end of May, that was it. Kit then wrote a letter to the builder in May and told him he had two weeks to complete the work until further action was taken. The worker than allegedly claimed his brother wouldto complete the work, but the parents-to-be have still not seen the extension completed. Kit said: Him and his brother agreed that for us not to pursue anything in court and sue him, heaposd finish the build. We said we wanted building regs to come out and check what youaposve done so far. We wanted it to be passed by them. Thataposs when we discovered the walls werenapost tied in and since negotiating with his brother to finish it, weaposve not heard from him since. It was a terrible web of lies. Lisa said: We were going through IVF at the time and it was one of those situations where everything had to go right to attend the hospital.I was having lots of hormonal treatments. When it comes to IVF and pregnancy, having that much high-level stress as well and losing out on a lot of money when youaposre hoping to start a family is very hard to deal with.The first treatment was not successful which we canapost blame on him, but I would just say that I definitely have doubts that I was in the best position, and the calmest, at that time. Me and Kit we run our business together. This is our sole income, our sole project, and this outhouse was supposed to be for our business so for months we had to have all our stock in our house. The builder, who is still believed to be working in the trade, claimed he did not believe the couple received a full refund as they had had some work done - but did not explain why he had still held on to the full amount for almost a year. The tradesman said: It wasnapost completed but there are two sides to any story. It may not have been completed but it doesnapost go to say Iaposve just p***ed £, up the walls. Obviously the building was knocked down, all the footings were dug out, all the insulation had been put in, the concrete slabs had been put in and the brickwork had all been near enough completed. I know obviously there is a couple of issues with the brickwork but it can be resolved. Building inspectors said we havenapost got enough wall size in it. We spoke to the structural engineer. At this point, Kit had given me a deadline. I couldnapost complete it to the deadline so he agreed for my brother to finish off the work. I waited nearly four and a half months for the building architectural design to be drawn up by them, at that point my brother took an extension job on and itaposs taken him up to Christmas. I got a letter just before Christmas asking for a full refund. I donapost owe [them] a full refund because Iaposve done near enough, Iaposd say at least,  per cent of the work. If I can get proof of [the building regs saying it isnapost safe and needs to come down], Iaposll give them their money back. Thataposs not what the builder inspector told my brother. I donapost need to speak to them. If they want their £, they can take me to court and get it. I donapost feel that I need to pay them the full £, back when theyaposve had  per cent of their work done. I knew there wasnapost enough wall size but itaposs news to me that it needs to be fully knocked down. A spokesperson for Halton Borough Council says: I can confirm the couple contacted Halton Trading Standards and were given some impartial advice. We are unable to comment further on inidual cases.

Leoaai Elghareeb, , has denied guilt by reason of insanity. Elghareeb is said to have walked down Fulham Palace Road in West London carrying a black bucket full of syringes, some of which had needles attached, throwing them at people outside and inside a Waitrose, Tesco and Sainsburyaposs. CCTV footage seen by the jury shows Elghareeb deliberately injecting apples, ready meals and packets of chicken tikka fillets in the three stores. He is also accused of throwing a syringe of blood at the chest of an NHS doctor in the street during the alleged rampage on the evening of  August last year. Prosecutors also said he pushed a security guard in the chest in Sainsburyaposs where he also threw eggs and swore at staff and customers, Isleworth Crown Court heard. Elghareed was detained and arrested outside a pub shortly after he picked up a plant pot outside the restaurant and threw it through the open door, jurors were told.  A total of  syringes were recovered. The stores were forced to take the precaution of throwing away and destroying all their produce, and restocking, before reopening days later. This led to costs of £, for Waitrose, £, for Sainsburyaposs and £, for Tesco. Elghareeb denied today three counts of contaminating food with the intent to cause the public alarm, anxiety or injury and two counts of assault by beating. Opening the case, prosecutor Philip Stott said: In the early evening of a late summeraposs day last year, Mr Elghareeb walked down the Fulham Palace Road in West London carrying a bucket. It was filled with syringes, some of which had hypodermic needles attached.  A number of those syringes were filled with blood - his own. Mr Elghareeb then entered, in turn, three supermarkets on the Fulham Palace Road - in order they were: Waitrose, Sainsburyaposs and Tesco - and proceeded to stick those syringes in food products inside those branches of those supermarkets. Along the way he also threw some of the syringes at people inside and outside the store including hitting a passerby on the street.  As he was confronted, because of his actions, by a succession of store personnel inside the supermarkets he assaulted one of them by pushing him, in addition to throwing verbal insults at those around him. An NHS doctor was walking along Crabtree Lane around .pm, the prosecutor said, and was uncomfortable as Elghareeb seemed aggressive. Mr Stott said: As the defendant passed her, he threw a syringe at her, hitting her in the chest. Fortunately, the syringe had no needle attached to it, and it just bounced off her without causing any injuries.  It appeared to her that this was not the first syringe that the defendant had thrown because she saw and spoke to other people in Crabtree Lane who were picking them up off the ground. The defendant continued up to Fulham Palace Road. He then went into a branch of Little Waitrose, located at - Fulham Palace Road. He began to throw syringes and also to stick them into the packets of food there.  Once staff realised what had happened, they told everyone to drop their shopping and leave, and then closed the store. A number of syringes filled with blood were recovered from the branch, some of which were found on the floor, and some of were sticking into packets of food, for example apples and a packet of chicken tikka fillets. After he left Waitrose, the defendant continued north along Fulham Palace Road and straight into a branch of Sainsburyaposs Local. He carried out the same action, throwing syringes and sticking them into produce inside the store.  At this point, as you can see on the CCTV, a member of staff confronted the defendant about his actions. As you saw there, the defendant pushed one of the security guards on his chest. The security guard will tell you that the defendant was shouting things like aposyou are all vile people and Sainsburyaposs is vileapos. He was also swearing at the staff and at customers and throwing eggs, before leaving. Again, staff closed the store and found syringes on the floor and into items like packets of meat and ready meals.  The prosecutor said Elghareeb carried out the same actions in the Tesco Express where a store manager closed as soon as they noticed what was happening. Mr Stott continued: Mr Elghareeb walked past a tapas bar called Avanti. He picked up a plant pot which was on a table outside the restaurant and threw it through the open restaurant door narrowly missing a waiter before walking off again. By this time, the police had been called and Mr Elghareeb was detained and arrested shortly afterwards further up the road outside a public house called The Distillers. As you would expect Waitrose, Sainsburyaposs and Tesco thoroughly searched their stores and then had them deep-cleaned before they were able to reopen. A total of  syringes were recovered from inside those stores and outside on the street. The stores, also inevitably, took the precaution of throwing away and destroying all their produce, before reopening some days later. All that cost, in respect of Waitrose, approximately £,, in respect of Sainsburyaposs, £,, and in respect of Tescoaposs approximately £,. So nearly half a million pounds worth of loss to those three businesses. Jurors were told while it is agreed Elghareeb carried out the actions on  August , and he is fit to stand trial now, the defence will say he was suffering from a disease of the mind so as not to know what he was doing was wrong.. Elghareeb, wearing a grey prison-issue tracksuit and glasses, only spoke during arraignment to confirm his name and to enter his five pleas of not guilty to contaminating food and assault. He repeatedly shook his leg during the hearing but did not show any other emotion. The trial continues.Follow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Waitrose Ltd.TescoNHSSainsburysCCTVFoodCCTV footageCourt caseCrown courtSupermarkets\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

However, sheaposs now tested positive for the virus and is isolating at Windsor Castle.In keeping with her normal business as usual approach, the -year-old intends to carry out light duties while she isolates in line with government guidelines. Fortunately, the Queen has been fully-vaccinated and Buckingham Palace said yesterday she was suffering only mild symptoms.But at the start of the pandemic in March  when little was known about the virus and no vaccines were available, a protective bubble was thrown around the Queen and the now late Prince Philip in a bid to stop them from contracting Covid.It saw around  royal staff sacricing their home lives to stay isolated at Windsor in order to assist the Queen during lockdown.The group was christened aposHMS Bubbleapos, a joke the Queen and Prince Philip were said to find very amusing, by Vice-Admiral Sir Tony Johnstone-Burt, master of the household. In an email to staff, the former naval officer likened their situation to being out at sea. He wrote: “There are  Royal Household staff inside the Bubble, and it struck me that our predicament is not dissimilar to my former le in the Royal Navy on a long overseas deployment. Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm. Click here to sign up .“Indeed, the challenges that we are facing, whether self-isolating alone at home, or with our close household and families, have parallels with being at sea, away from home for many months, and having to deal with a sense of dislocation, anxiety and uncertainty. In April last year, when Prince Philip died aged , HMS Bubble was still in place and the close aides who isolated at Windsor are said to have been a source of support to her. Among those closest to her, thereported, were her senior dresser Angela Kelly, head groom, Terry Pendry, private secretary Sir Edward Young and page of the backstairs, Paul Whybrew. However, with almost no Covid restrictions in place in England and members of the Royal Family, including the Queen, now conducting face-to-face duties, a source told the Daily Mail that HMS Bubble had been relaxed of late.The explained: Itaposs bubble-ish. If you are going to the castle or coming into direct contact with the Queen then you are required to test but, in general, restrictions are clearly not as rigorous as they were this time a year or  months ago.Meanwhile, royal expert Roya Nikkhah told the BBC Radio aposs Today programme that the Queen herself understood HMS wasnapost tenable for the future.She said: There has been a lot of talk about this HMS Bubble around the Queen for a couple of years which has been very successful, but I think long term the Queen understood more than anyone it wasnapost tenable to continue.  aposIt placed a huge demand on pressures on staff who had to isolate and be away from their families for a long time. aposSo I think she was very sanguine about that and probably inevitably accepted that she might be at risk at some point, but fingers crossed sheaposll be well – sheaposs triple-vaxxed – and carry on. Itaposs believed the Queenaposs Covid diagnosis came after a number of her team have also been hit by the virus. But Buckingham Palace has said the monarch expects to be at her desk continuing light duties over the coming days.The Queen holds an audience with Boris Johnson most Wednesdays, either in person or by telephone, and has recently been holding one or two diplomatic audiences a week with ambassadors by video-link, and is likely to do so this weekwell enough.She will also be given a digest of the day’s news from the early-morning radio and television bulletins, and a selection of papers, with her photo gracing most of the front pages after the announcement that she has Covid.Her diagnosis follows a string of cases among the royal family, with the Prince of Wales meeting his mother in the week he tested positive, and the Duchess of Cornwall also isolating after contracting the virus.The monarch, who for almost two years avoided contracting Covid, has served as a symbol of national stability during the pandemic, delivering two rare televised addresses to the nation weeks apart.

Angharad Williamson, , and partner John Cole, , allegedly killed little Logan Mwangi before throwing him in the body of water just  metres from the family home, the court was told.A teen boy, who canapost be named for legal reasons, is also accused of taking part in the murder - and all three are charged with allegedly reporting his disappearance to cover up the killing. Logan was reported missing to police by his mother - only for his body to be discovered in the river in a neighbouring park. In total, a pathologist found  external injuries to Loganaposs head, face, trunk, arms and legs which were caused by blunt force trauma, Prosecutor Caroline Rees QC told jurors at Cardf Crown Court today .It was apparent that Logan had died before his body was placed in the river, she added. The prosecution say that Logan died as a result of a brutal and sustained assault upon him which happened inside the home, she said. It is the use of forceful violence which caused the catastrophic injuries found at post mortem. Williamson, Cole, and the teenage boy are all accused of murder and perverting the course of justice. Describing Logan as a “polite, kind and caring” youngster, Ms Rees accused each of the defendants of playing their own part in his killing.Ms Rees said: Logan was described by those who knew and loved him in during his short le as a lovely little boy, Chatty, polite, kind and caring. He was five years old when his body was found by police in the River Ogmore in Pandy Park, Bridgend. Logan was murdered and each of the defendants played their part in killing him. Logan would not have stood a chance against any one of these defendants, let alone three of them acting together.  Having killed Logan behind closed doors in the family home they each played their part in covering up the circumstances of his death. Each were desperate to save themselves and each prioritised their self-preservation over everything , in particular over the needs of Logan. He would not have stood a chance against any one of the defendants, let alone three of them acting together. Ms Rees said mum Williamson phoned  at .am to ly report Logan missing, and was crying down the phone and sounding asshe were hyperventilating. The court heard she told police she had left the back gate open and then set to blame another woman for kidnapping Logan. Ms Rees said: She appeared to be distressed and asshe were hyperventilating. This was an elaborate charade. The court heard Logan suffered severe injuries compared to a fall from a great height or a high velocity road traffic collision.  Ms Rees said: Logan had suffered severe injuries to his internal organs and brain. His brain suffered suffered trauma and he had  external injuries including to the head, face, to the trunk, arms and legs. Logan was reported missing from his flat in Lower Llansantffraid, Sarn, Bridgend, in the morning of July  last year before his body was found a short while later. Ms Rees said: Logan was disposed of by the defendants asfly-tipping. Judge Mrs Justice Jefford told jurors: Cases that relate to a personaposs death are as serious as you as a jury can be entrusted to deal with. The death of anyone, particularly the death of a child, may give rise to serious feelings or emotions. In any part it is important you put your emotions to one side and judge this case on careful and thoughtful consideration of the evidence. Williamson and Cole appeared in the dock at Cardf Crown Court while the youngster appeared via videolink from another room inside the court building. Williamson and the teenage boy deny murder and perverting the course of justice.Cole denies murder but admits perverting the course of justice. Cardf Crown Court heard the three are accused of moving Loganaposs body from his home to an area near the River Ogmore at Pandy Park in Sarn, Bridgend. The charge states they moved Loganaposs clothing to the same area and allegedly washed his blood-stained bedsheets and phoned police to ly report him as missing saying his location was unknown. Logan - also known as Logan Williamson - had been reported missing by his mother before his body was discovered just  metres from his home in the Ogmore River in Bridgend, South Wales, on July . A court previously heard the youngster suffered “extreme pain” in an attack before he was found following a search. Cole is represented by David Elias QC, Williamson by Peter Rouch QC and the youth by John Hipkin QC. The trial, expected to last up to eight weeks, continues.Follow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON MurderCourt caseCrown courtMurder trialCrime\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Their relationship was still secret, so most of their early dates took place in private restaurants or at each otheraposs homes where they knew they were safe from prying eyes. But as they grew stronger, they started venturing out into the outside world. While in Meghanaposs Canadian hometown, Toronto, the pair wanted to celebrate Halloween, so they came up with a plan.Meghan revealed that she and Harry, along with Princess Eugenie and her now-husband Jack Brooksbank went on a night out at Soho House in Toronto - but to make sure nobody recognised them, they went in disguise.

And the four of us snuck out in Halloween costumes to just have one fun night on the town before it was out in the world that we were a couple. Ellen said: So you went with Harry to a Halloween party and they had no idea it was the two of you  Meghan confirmed this, saying: It was a post-apocalypse theme, so we had all this very bizarre costuming on, and we were able to just have one fun final night out. But it was this night that Prince Harry received a call that would change their relationship forever.In an unauthorized biography, Finding Freedom, authors Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand, the authors said the pair were having the perfect night out - until they received a call from one of Harryaposs aides at Kensington Palace. It wasnapost good news. The couple were told that the press had discovered they were dating. The next day, their relationship would be announced all over the world. So, the Halloween party was the last opportunity that Meghan and Harry would be able to celebrate their relationship privately.It appears Eugenie has remained close to Harry following his and Meghanaposs choice to stand down from the royal family, as they were seen together at the Super Bowl in the US last week. The royal pair were pictured together in the stands - although were without Meghan and Eugenieaposs husband Jack. According to royal expert and biographer Duncan Larcombe, Eugenie publicly supporting Harry at the Super Bowl shows she is breaking ranks from the rest of the royals. He told OK!: The royals have stayed quite consistent and firm when it comes to Harry and Meghan, as we’ve seen. Eugenie is breaking ranks from the rest of the royals by being seen so publicly to endorse Harry and Meghan in their new le. It endorses what they said about the royals. There are those that think that Eugenie is Harry’s only hope of him being brought back in should things not work out in paradise, so at least he is talking to someone in the Royal Family. By seeing Eugenie there, it looks like the only link he still has with his family.Have you got a story to share We want to hear all about it.

The charity shop volunteer from Speke, Liverpool finds herself ironing  dferent pieces of unorm each morning and making three dferent meals at dinner time for her brood of fussy eaters. Vicky, and her partner Craig Williams, , make sure to stock up on all of the essentials to cater for their blended family of  who go through  pints of milk and  loaves of bread per week. She is a proud mum to, Tom,  Ellie,  Libby,  Lexie,  Mikey,  Craig,  Riley, eight Annie, six twins Matilda and Teddy, four James,  weeks and Emma and Lottie who sadly passed.The stay at home mum, said: “It’s definitely a full-time job catering to such a large family, but it’s always been my dream to be a mum. “We have a five-bed house where seven of the kids live with us full time, and Craig’s two come and stay at the weekends. “Our days start pretty early, and the kitchen is one of the most hectic places to be.  “We only have two bathrooms as well, so trying to get all of the kids washed and dressed can be dficult, especially with the bathroom hogs! “Two of the older kids are in high school so they have hot lunches, the primary school kids have packed lunches which are super quick and easy to put together. “The twins are at nursery part time, so they come home for lunch, and we will usually have some quick like sandwiches.“Craig and I are in the kitchen from around .pm to pm for dinner each day as we usually have to cook three entirely dferent meals, as a few of the kids are pretty picky eaters. “We cook everything from chicken nuggets and chips to pasta bakes, spaghetti bolognese, and curries. “Sundays are quite relaxing when it comes to meal times though, as everyone loves a Sunday dinner, so I try and make a roast at least twice a week. She added: “Most of my day is spent in the kitchen, as when I get up, I have to iron the kids’ unorms, and put on the first of several loads of washing. “Most of the kids will wear their clothes for one day and then just put in the basket, so it’s something we are trying to cut down on, as it’s just non-stop cycles up until pm each night. “I try and get all of the cleaning done in the morning, but as soon as the twins come home, Teddy is like a tornado creating messes in my wake.  “Although Teddy does really enjoy cleaning sometimes and even has a little rag and spray bottle that he walks around the house with. “All of the kids are tasked with tidying their own bedrooms and will sometimes help out at meal times.” With such a big family, days out can be expensive, so Vicky and Craig make sure to be as budget as possible exploring parks and having picnics. She said: “The young one’s love going on walks and on days out. “Craig takes them all on muddy walks by the sea, and they just love getting messy and splashing around in puddles with their wellies. “We have lots of local parks around as well, so we also make sure to pack a big picnic on days out during the summer. “It’s always been my dream to have a big farmhouse where all of the wellies are lined up at the back door – so it’s great that we can get the kids enjoying nature in other ways for now.” After catering for their children  , Craig and Vicky very rarely get any personal time, so have had to be inventive with ways to get away every now and again. Vicky said: “I volunteer at a charity shop, and it’s so nice to just be me and be called Vicky, rather than being shouted at with ‘mum’ or ‘mummy’. “It’s nice to have a change of scenery every now and again. “Craig and I very rarely have a date night, but we will always go out together on our birthdays and anniversaries as a little treat.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON EducationPregnancySecondary schoolTwins\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

In a statement to the House of Commons this afternoon, Boris Johnson confirmed free universal testing would end in England at the start of April.But to stop members of the public buying more kits than needed in the month leading up to April , the government has limited sales to a single LFT box every three days. Previously, people could buy one kit per day to check for Covid infection.It comes as Johnson updated MPs on the ending of all coronavirus restrictions.He says the UK must now scale back testing but that the UK will have the ability to ramp up testing in the NHS should the need arise.He added that science advisors are certain there will be future new iants.Boris Johnson told MPs: Until April  we will still advise people who test positive to stay at home but after that we will encourage people with Covid- symptoms to exercise personal responsibility, just as we encourage people who may have flu to be considerate to others. Itaposs only because levels of immunity are so high and deaths are nowanything below where you would normally expect for this time of year that we can lt these restrictions, he added.Itaposs only because we know Omicron is less severe that testing for Omicron on the colossal scale weaposve been doing is much less important and much less valuable in preventing serious illness.The biggest testing programme per person of any large country in the world, he said, came at vast cost, adding: The test, trace and isolation budget in   exceeded the entire budget of the Home Office. It cost a further £. billion in this financial year and £ billion in January alone at the height of the Omicron wave.

Nicola Fawkes, from Ynyshir in Wales, said her children were left in tears by the absolutely disgusting accommodation at the Brean Sands resort. The family were shocked to find rubbish and dirt everywhere in their rooms, she added.The -year-old mum, her four children, parents and niece had originally planned to stay at the nearby Sandy Glade holiday park but when they arrived late on Friday they found it was closed because of Storm Eunice, Wales Online reports.The family spent £ on a seven-day holiday at Pontins as a replacement. They stayed at a hotel overnight and got to Brean Sands on Saturday afternoon. Pontins has its reputation, said Nicola. We had our cleaning essentials ready, expecting a bit of dust. With Covid, I naively thought theyaposd have stepped up their game but nothing could prepare us for what we walked into.Nicola and her family joined the check-in queue at pm. When we got to the queue there were already people complaining about issues with chalets not being clean, said Nicola. I thought, aposHere we go, itaposs starting.apos We got to where we were staying and I could see the windows were very dirty. I could see through the windows there was a wooden drawer on the sofa. I thought the cleaner must still be in there. On opening the door, there was a damp smell and it was a case of: aposWhere do you look first, what do you take a photo of first apos My daughters were going, aposOh my god mam, look at this, itaposs disgusting.aposThe fridge was in the middle of the kitchen unplugged. Where the fridge was supposed to be, there was dirt. There were burn marks on the splashback for the cooker. The wardrobe was in the middle of one bedroom. There was a big long screw on one of the beds. In the bathroom there was faeces down the toilet. There were dead spiders on the ceilings. There was rubbish absolutely everywhere, an ibuprofen packet, dust, a dirty kne on the kitchen floor. There was mould on the bottom of the curtains and the ceiling. It was just horrendous. It makes you feel physically sick that they expect people to stay there on holiday. Nicola went back to reception. She said there was a queue of  to  other people who also had complaints, from dead spiders in the bath to broken wardrobes.I told the manager I wouldnapost expect a dog to sleep in that place, she added. They said thereaposd been a backlog because of the storm. I said the storm was outside rather than inside our chalet. Although it looked like it had been inside. Nicola said the manager told her the accommodation had been missed on the cleaning list. She was offered a dferent chalet — but it did not impress the family much more. So we walked into the next one and I would say, out of , it was . better. The first one had not really been on the scale, it was way down in the minuses. This one had patio door windows you couldnapost see through because of the grime.Again the furniture was all in the middle of rooms. The fridge was again unplugged in the middle of the kitchen. There was urine down the toilet. There was a dead spider in the corner of the bathroom, cobwebs everywhere, black dirt all up the curtains. There were white splashes on the front of the fridge, I donapost knowit was milk. On one bed there was a see-through bag with pillows in. I was in shock. By this point my two younger ones were crying. Weaposd been travelling for hours. We went back up to reception and it was even more packed than the first time with people complaining. I got to the front of the queue and said, aposYouaposve got to be having a giraffe. This is my second property and itaposs disgusting.apos Again, they said itaposs been missed from the cleaning list. I said, aposAll the people here, have their properties been missed too aposThe manager said yes. He said, aposIf youaposre not happy you can leave.apos He was quite abrupt at this point. I said, aposOK I want my refund now.apos I was told I would have to wait until Monday for the woman who deals with refunds to be in the office. Nicola said the manager told her cleaners would go to the chalet urgently so she ed. But three hours passed and no one came, she claimed. So I drove back to reception, she added. Itaposs about .pm now. Once he got past the other people with complaints, the manager came to us. He was hostile, he recognised me straight away. I said it had been three hours and he said, aposTheyaposre on their way.apos  I said, aposEvery one of us is going to get out of the car and stand in reception, including my children, and weaposre going to do a standoff.apos He radioed through and then he told me the cleaners had been to the property. We went back to check and as we got there, two lads in their mid-s were leaving. There was still a dead spider but it looked good on the surface. They were very apologetic, I canapost fault those two boys. Then our electricity went off. My dad went to reception and it was  minutes before it came back on. We were there in the pitch black using torches on our phones. There was no bedding. We had to wait about an hour for duvets to arrive. Itaposs about .pm at this point and my younger children usually go to bed at .pm. The two lads whoaposd cleaned the property arrived with the duvets, and then they came back another  to  minutes later with the pillows.  When Nicola woke the next morning she felt like she had been dragged through a hedge backwards. She described the bed as like cardboard. She said: If it wasnapost for my children being upset because they thought they werenapost going to get a holiday, thereaposs no way I would have stayed in that property. Itaposs not fit for a dog. The holiday feeling has gone. If Sandy Glade reopens tonight, then weaposre gone. Pontins has been approached for comment.Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Pontins Ltd.\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

He says he wants to bring his children Archie and Lilibet to visit from the US where he now lives with we Meghan Markle, but his barrister told the High Court during a hearing on Friday that he “does not feel safe” when visiting under the current security arrangements. He is arguing that his private protection team in the US does not have adequate jurisdiction abroad or access to UK intelligence information which is needed to keep his family safe. And now this had led some to believe thatthis is the case, he will notto the UK next month when a memorial service for his late beloved grandfather Prince Philip takes place at Westminster Abbey on March .A source close to the Royal Family told the Mail On Sunday : They donapost think itaposs likely heaposll come back because it would undermine his position that itaposs too much of a threat.However, in a written submission to the court last week, Robert Palmer QC for the Home Office did point out that Harry had a form of exceptional status”. Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm. Click here to sign up .This means he is considered for personal protective security by the police “with the precise arrangements being dependent on the reason for his presence in Great Britain and by reference to the s he carries out when present”. During the hearing last Friday, Shaheed Fatima QC, for the duke, said: “This claim is about the fact that the claimant does not feel safe when he is in the UK given the security arrangements applied to him in June  and will continue to be applied to him.”  She continued: “It goes without saying that he does want to come back to see family and friends and to continue to support the charities that are so close to his heart. “Most of all, this is and always will be his home.” A legal representative for Harry previously said the duke wants to fund the security himself, rather than ask taxpayers to foot the bill. However, Mr Palmer QC for the Home Office told the court the duke’s offer of private funding was “irrelevant. In written submissions, he said: “Personal protective security by the police is not available on a privately financed basis, and Ravec does not make decisions on the provision of such security on the basis that any financial contribution could be sought or obtained to pay for it.” The hearing in front of Mr Justice Swt continues, with a written judgment due at a later date.

But the way the Queen likes it cooked is quite surprising, according to a former member of staff.Grant Harrold, who worked with the royal family for seven years as a butler to Prince Charles at Highgrove House, told MyLondon that Her Majesty likes her steak well-done and that it is apparently quite unusual for her to have it cooked like that.Grant said: The Queen likes beef well done, she has things well done, which is really interesting. I find in the world of aristocracy, things are always kind of medium or rare but she likes it well done.

Most people like it rare or still kind of walking. He went on to say the Royal Family all have a very healthy diet that is very traditional, just home-cooked food.Prince William and Prince Harry were brought up on the same sort of diet, he said, adding how much they loved cottage pie.The boys were the same, they were brought up on traditional things - so the things we all love, he said. It was revealed the Queen takes her steak well done when former royal chef Darren McGrady recreated one of her favourite meals, Gaelic steaks, on his YouTube channel.During the video, he said: It was really, really important that we got a really good sear on the steaks and cooked her steak well done. He served the steak with a thick mushroom sauce, which is made with lashes of cream because one thing the Queen doesnapost care about is calories, he says. “The Queen was never one for surprises in the kitchen, McGrady said, as he said some of the dishes on her regular menu date back to Queen Victoria’s era, including the kitchen’s classic chocolate cake. The Chocolate Biscuit Cake is the only cake that goes back again and again and again every day until itaposs all gone, he told baking website RecipePlus. Sheaposll take a small slice every day until eventually there is only one tiny piece, but you have to send that up, she wants to finish the whole of that cake.Have you got a story to share We want to hear all about it.

Rats are excellent swimmers with bendy bones and can squeeze into the smallest of spaces. “They can hold their breath for three minutes and tread water for three days, and they are coming up waste pipes.  “They’re cunning and getting bolder and bolder. Basically,they want to get into your home, they will.” The explosion in UK rat numbers is causing chaos. They are said to number  million – the most ever. Mr Helands continued: “This has increased by % each year over the Covid pandemic. “People are scared and they should be. There are more rats than ever and they are taking over. I have seen some the size of cats.”  He said that the increase in numbers of people working from home means rats don’t have as much food to eat in city centres – so they are coming into homes instead. Two weeks ago, it was reported how bin-men were being attacked by rats. In some areas binmen are banging bins before emptying amid fears of being scratched or bitten. Mr Helands, who runs Sussex pest control business Pests Be Gone continued: “There are ways of pest proofing your home. “You can get rat gates for water pipes – these used to be used in very rural areas, such as near canals, but now we are recommending them even in built-up housing areas.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Giant ratsInstagramOn Instagram\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Logan Mwangi was found dead after being dumped in the River Ogmore near his home village of Sarn in Bridgend County on July  . He was wearing mismatched pyjamas and had  catastrophic injuries to his head, face, torso, arms and legs, a jury of seven woman and five men were told on Monday. Prosecutor Caroline Rees QC said the little boyaposs injuries were from blunt force trauma, with experts saying they were more consistent with a fall from great height or high speed car crash. Loganaposs mother Angharad Williamson, , step-dad John Cole, , and a teenage boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, are charged with murdering the youngster between July  and August .All three are also accused of perverting the course of justice, including moving Loganaposs body to the river near Pandy Park, removing his clothing, washing bloodstained bed linen, and making a  missing person report to police. Williamson and the youth pleaded not guilty to both offences, while Cole denied murder. Williamson and Cole were also charged with causing or allowing the death of a child, which they both denied. Ms Rees said it is the prosecutionaposs case that Logan had been submitted to a brutal and sustained assault by John Cole and the teenage boy on July  while he was hidden from view, behind closed doors in Loganaposs home in Lower Llansantffraid. She told the court: The prosecutionaposs case is that Logan was murdered and each of these three defendants played their part... Ms Rees said Williamson had done nothing to prevent or report the attack on her young son, not even disclosing what had happened when a social worker visited the house on the same day.  The teenager, who had previously made repeated threats that he wanted to kill Logan and wanted him dead was described by Ms Rees as a complex, troubled and violent boy who had been trained in the martial art of Muay Thai, also known as Thai boxing, to green belt level, the court heard. The jury were shown CCTV footage of Cole and the teenager leaving Loganaposs home in the early hours of July . Cole was filmed carrying something in his arms, which he later admitted was Loganaposs leless body. The pair walked across the river and along a path to the spot where Loganaposs body was found, the court was told. Cole and the boy then ed to the property before heading out again, this time to dispose of Loganaposs bloodied and torn dinosaur pyjama top, the court heard.  During this time, a light can be seen switching on and off in Loganaposs bedroom, which the prosecution said proves Williamson was awake and knew what had happened to her son. Ms Rees told the court that evidence from Williamsonaposs mobile phone, which showed she was awake in the early hours of the morning - after the time she told police she had gone to sleep - also proves her involvement. Williamson is said to have struggled to raise Logan in the lead up to his death, with her motherly bond with her son signicantly fractured during his time in self-isolation, Ms Rees said. She added: Angharad Williamson must have been awake and up and about, fully aware Logan had died and that his body had been dumped in the river - disposed of like they were fly-tipping rubbish.  An apparently distraught Williamson reported Logan missing at .am on July , accusing a woman she did not like of kidnapping him, the court was told.Cole and the youth were then caught on CCTV again, this time walking around and calling for Logan, jurors heard.Williamsonaposs  call and the alleged faked search for Logan were described by Ms Rees as a callous and elaborate attempt to cover up the trioaposs role in his death.Williamson, dressed in a navy blue blazer and glasses with dark brown hair, appeared distressed as a summary of the evidence against her and the two other defendants was read out. She began to cry, becoming more upset as the jury was shown a picture of Logan and the circumstances of his death were described. She sobbed as she was led out of the dock at the end of the hearing. Cole appeared in the dock wearing glasses and a light grey V-neck jumper over a white T-shirt, while the teenager appeared in a black T-shirt via video link from another room in the court. Both adults have been remanded in custody since they were charged. The trial, expected to last around eight weeks, continues.Follow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON CCTVCourt caseCrown courtMurder trialSocial workersCrimeMissing persons\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Many of those services which weren’t preemptively cancelled have been by blocked or flooded tracks and roads.As well as the yellow weather warning which remains across the UK until midday today, more than  flood warnings and alerts were issued.This included two severe flood warnings where there was a risk to le on the River Mersey in East Didsbury and at West Didsbury and Northenden. Rain was so bad overnight, that some parts of Manchester began evacuating people, with over  homes at risk as the River Mersey burst its banks. Have you been hammered by Storm Franklin  Email webnews@mirror  Shortly after am this morning, Councillor Bev Craig, Leader of Manchester City Council said the “process of evacuation was already underway.“We’re working closely with the police, fire service and the Environment Agency to protect residents living in the areas where we have severe flood warnings.The process of evacuation is already under way in order to protect as many people as possible given the forecast of more heavy rain throughout the day.”  Manchester and Derbyshire were some of the areas worst affected by the flooding as local rivers burst their banks and streets were flooded. Matlock, Derbyshire, was described as having had its streets in the town centre turned into a river. Such was the chaos caused on our roads and rail lines that train providers took the drastic action over advising Brits against using them, with some going as far as telling Brits to simply not travel today.  CrossCounty Trains said: “We are strongly recommending not to travel today. “Storms over the past week will have tested the infrastructure and with Storm Franklin today, we will have severe disruption across our network.” Meanwhile, National Rail asked customers to “avoid travelpossible” on Monday and South Western Railway issued a do not travel message after “a series of further incidents caused by high winds on Sunday evening”.  National Rail said the first services on most routes were cancelled, while there is a reduced timetable for Monday, alternative travel is unavailable and further disruption is expected. Major flooding across parts of Yorkshire has blocked multiple lines and shuttered South Yorkshireaposs Rotherham Central railway station until Tuesday. Rail operator TransPennine Express told customers on Twitter : Due to a river flooding the railway at Mexborough, trains are currently unable to operate between Doncaster, Meadowhall and Sheffield. All lines are blocked. In the capital, where wind gusts are up to around mph, London Overground services are cancelled or reduced. Roads across the country have been shut thanks to the high winds and torrential rain, whether because of debris like trees knocked over, or flooding carriageways.An Amber Warning for wind on Northern Ireland expired at am this morning and winds will peak during rush hour according to to Greg Dewhurst, senior meteorologist at the Met Office. He added that conditions will noticeably ease around lunchtime. The heavy showers that lashed northern England and Northern Ireland are set to move south-east he added and around midday, the Met Office removed a number of flood warnings. Storm Franklinaposs highest gust of mph was recorded at the Needles on the Isle of Wight on Sunday evening, followed by current gusts of mph on a mountaintop in Wales.  Itaposs still pretty strong out there and it will continue to be strong over the next few hours, Mr Dewhurst told the PA news agency. Thousands of homes in the UK are still without power due to Storm Eunice, and Storm Franklin is complicating recovery efforts. This came after huge waves were seen crashing on to coastal areas, homes were destroyed by strong winds, and emergency services deployed flood defences along swelling riverbanks on Sunday.  Colossal waves have been captured engulfing Newhaven lighthouse in West Quay, East Sussex, and Porthcawl Lighthouse in Bridgend, Wales. The River Don burst its banks in the Sprotbrough area of Doncaster in South Yorkshire on Sunday night, and police have warned people to stay away from dangerous fast-flowing water. South Yorkshire Police said: We ask people to remain away from the area of Sprotbrough Falls and Sprotbrough Lock in Doncaster, after the River Don burst its banks in this location earlier this evening. Many of the footpaths in this area are presently under water. The water is fast-flowing and poses a risk to people attempting to wade through it. Members of the public are being asked to remain away from the area at this time for their own safety. Thank you. Central Sheffieldaposs flood defences appear to have held, despite fears as the River Don raged through the city on Sunday night.

A venomous Huntsman spider was found in Hull after surviving in a cargo shop for around a month during its trip. The spider, which can grow up to  inches in leg span, was shipped thousands of miles from China accidentally. It gave staff quite the scare when they unpacked it, and not unwisely, they decided to leg it.Whilst the arachnid’s bite is not deadly to humans, it can still cause heart palpitations, vomiting and headaches.On Friday, the RSPCA captured the spider safely. A spokesman for the animal welfare charity said: Insp Boyd collected this Huntsman spider.  He fancied a holiday so he hopped on a shipping container in China and ended up in Hull. He gave staff quite a fright. Heaposs now having some RR at a specialist rescue centre Worryingly for arachnophobes, this is far from the first time the terrying spider has made its way to the UK. Two years ago, as the country was emerging from its first lockdown, a warehouse in Southwold, Suffolk underwent a similar discovery. A container was discovered to contain the exotic arachnid, and staff quickly called the RSPCA in again. The Mirroraposs newsletter brings you the latest news, exciting showbiz and TV stories, sport updates and essential political information.The newsletter is emailed out first thing every morning, at noon and every evening. Never miss a moment by signing up to our newsletter here.  At the time, RSPCA inspector Jason Finch said: “Huntsman spiders can grow up to cmin leg span so are a large iety. “This spider was on the smaller side and was only around cmfrom leg to leg. “Heaposd obviously been in the container for some time, without access to food and water, but he was still active and seemed to be OK.” He went onto say that finding exotic spiders, insects or repitiles in shipping or removal containers actually “happens quite often”. He added: “These creatures are often picked up by mistake and end up being shut inside containers or boxes. “Huntsman spiders are venomous but are not dangerous to people although they can give a nasty bite so we would always advise caution around them.“We always advise treating any unidentied animal with caution until identied accurately and not to try to handle an accidentally imported animal that has been discovered.” Instead of building webs, huntsman spiders earn their names by tracking down and killing their prey. They originate from parts of Australia, Africa, Asia, the Mediterranean Basin and the Americas. The giant spider grows to around six inches in leg span on average and several huntsman species use a bizarre cartwheel like motion to travel around, by rolling on its legs. Because they are not UK natives, releasing these spiders into the wild, or allowing them to escape, would be an offence under the Wildle and Countryside Act .

For one Marvel-loving birthday boy, it had to be the Hulk, a fictional character who transforms from mild-mannered physicist to lime green, extraordinarily strong humanoid whenever he starts feeling angry.

Most importantly of all, they were all crafted with a high level of artistic and technical skill, the sort of impressive confection you probably couldnapost whip up in your own kitchen. Remarking, all I wanted was a Hulk cake, disheartened Brent - who goes by the username brenttelevision - then showed what he actually got, a creation that was monstrous in all the wrong ways.The cake in question was certainly green but didnapost bear any of the Hulkaposs other characteristics, looking more like a jelly baby than a powerful, pitiless beast capable of deadlting a bus. Instead of a snarl, the cake featured a thin black line that could be a half-hearted smile or a blank look of general boredom, while its , spongey limbs look more flippers than muscle-bound weapons. Brent couldnapost look more disappointed with his birthday apostreatapos, but at least his followers have been given a good laugh, comparing Honk or Mulk to everything from a Mincecraft zombie to Shrek, to the squidgy, friendly Pokemon Ditto.

A train loaded with Terminator tank support fighting vehicles is seen in a video evidently for the first time heading towards the border. The Terminator is seen as especially suited to urban warfare. The ominous manoeuvres have been taken part in the Belgorod region of Russia only days after Moscow was originally supposed to withdraw troops, before reneging on that promise. Russian forces are now closer than ever to the frontier in preparation for an invasion which officials in the west have repeatedly warned is coming. One of the videos shows a convoy on the move near Shebekino, close to the border.The short-range all-weather Tor air defence system was visible. A Russian mobile military hospital is also seen in Shebekino town, perhaps three miles from the frontier. The presence of such medical facilities and associated blood banks is seen in the West as evidence that Putin is serious about an invasion. In another video, tanks are visible in snow at Kamenka in Kursk region, less than four miles from the Ukrainian border. Other footage shows army moves underway, for example MSTA-S howitzers around  miles from the frontier.  Multiple videos posted on TikTok and other social media from Belgorod and Kursk regions show Russian firepower in positions within easy reach of Ukraine, supporting US and UK warnings that an invasion could be imminent. As well as that, Russia staged major naval war games in the eastern Mediterranean as Moscow closed much of the Azov Sea, close to Ukraine, for drills. The Mediterranean drills involve warships from Putin’s Pacic, Northern and Black Sea fleets. Putin’s decision to reverse his previously declared intention and keep his forces in autocratic Belarus further highlights the threat of invasion to Ukraine.

But one Western source said: “Whether or not Putin invades Ukraine, it looks like he has cemented his control of Belarus without anyone noticing.”. State TV channel Rossiya  anchorman Dmitry Kiselyov - described as Vladimir Putin’s “mouthpiece” or “propagandist-in-chief” - launched a scathing attack on the Queen and Johnson needed a war to deflect attention from scandals engulfing the royal family and Downing Street. It was the Americans and English that need war”, he said, alleging Britain was especially “thirsting” for a conflict due to problems engulfing the royal family and the lockdown parties held in Downing Street. Russia, in contrast, was forcing the West into dialogue and peace”, he claimed. “ Boris Johnson ’s office keenly awaits this war because it switches attention from his government’s crisis to the pre-programmed ‘Russian invasion’,” Kiselyov told viewers.“The Royal Family is in urgent need of distractions, too, as Scotland Yard digs into Prince Charles giving away high British awards - honourable titles and even citizenship to foreign businessman Mahfouz Marei Mubarak bin Mahfouz. “Yet they very much want to distract attention - eventhis distraction is war. “The Queen’s favourite son Prince Andrew has settled with the victim of his rape at Mummy’s expense -  million - in a US court. “The -year-old Queen will pay.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Vladimir PutinRoyal FamilyPoliticsUkraine crisisRussia\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Amongst these is Beinn Odhar # its southern slopes lying firmly in the county of Stirling, whilst its summit stands proudly in Argyll.If approached from the west, north or south you could keep your toes in Argyll all day. Unless on a round of Corbetts # there are five here that make a fine challenge # it is easier to approach the Corbett via its gentler slopes from Tyndrum. This also gives the opportunity to explore the adit # access tunnel # and old lead mine on its higher slopes where the mineral vein continuation from Sron nan Colan is exposed. The Beinn Odhar lead mining venture appears to have been a short one but the views once the summit is reached are tremendous.Leaving the car park, cross the A and head left passing the Tyndrum Inn, the Green Welly Stop and cross the bridge.Turn right immediately after crossing the bridge to join the West Highland Waynorthwards, passing the KeyStore.You will need to stay on the WHW for the next .km as it slowly climbs out of Tyndrum with the A on your left and the Crom Allton your right until you reach the bridges over the burn and railway.Cross the bridges and go through the gate at the north end. You will be heading up on to the open hillside to your right.You now have a choice. Either head straight up in a north easterly direction picking your own route on the grassy slopes or veer slightly right back to the Crom Allt to pick up a faint path. If you use the latter, ensure you head upwards at around NN. Either way you will tend to end up on sections of the old mining path as it zigs zags upwards by default due to the natural line of the slope.Once you reach m # after approximately .km depending on how direct your route was # the ground becomes stonier. The adit and mine are higher to your left, northwest, on the crest of the ridgeline, whereas the faint path runs just under this soyou want to explore them it is worth scrabbling up the rocks to have a look. The bottom of the adit starts at around ms.Heading up from the adit and mine # or path # the route flattens out, passing a lochan and the county boundary to your left. Ahead, the final ascent is best tackled by heading northeast then northwest to follow the hill’s natural line. There are no particular dficulties.The summit views are fabulous and an excellent panorama of Beinn Dorain can be had from the steep northern slopes above Coire Luaidh.It is easiest todown the southwestern slopes you ascended, but other possibilities could include some of the neighbouring Corbetts, especially the longer days in summer.Safety in the outdoorsThe described routes and accompanying information are there to be used as a guide and do not replace the use of map and compass and the skills required to use them.Whilst every effort is made to ensure the route is accurate at the time of going to print,  please be aware track and path closures can happen at any time.

In addition there may also be a possibility of linking into the generation of tidal energy being taken forward by the private sector.#Executive director Kirsty Flanagan said in the report: #[The] key issue for the buses will be meeting revenue implications and there will be a need to match fund this capital bid with  per cent of the capital costs.#It should be noted that Transport Scotland, through its infrastructure partner CMAL, is taking forward a series of transport connectivity projects on the island, most notably the expansion of Port Ellen Ferry Terminal. There is potential to work with this project to add impact to our proposal.#[A] replacement Jura ferry [is planned] to create an increased capacity and resilience. [We are] working with CMAL on small vessel replacement.#[We are] looking to have a common style of vessel, -m long, to provide resilience across the west coast network and reduce upfront costs with a single model.

Following a decision of council last Thursday I am pleased to say that the independent inquiry report will be published today in full, and it will be available online on the council’s website later at www.scotborders.gov.uk SBCinquiry.“It is important to read the report in its entirety as it provides a clear picture and timeline of what happened and when..remove“Andrew Webster QC spent time presenting the findings of his independent inquiry at a meeting of full council last Thursday, after which the council agreed unanimously to issue a written apology to the parents of the young people concerned. I can confirm that this has now been undertaken by the chief executive.“On behalf of the council, I am sorry that the matters were not referred to the Child Protection Unit at the earliest opportunity, as they should have been, and I am sorry that the council failed to communicate appropriately with those parents who had raised ious concerns. Most of all, the council apologises wholeheartedly that the incidents of abuse occurred in the first place.“We must now learn from these mistakes and ensure they are never repeated. At last Thursday’s meeting it was agreed that a further full council meeting be held, in public, at the earliest opportunity. This will allow further detailed consideration and discussion on the content of Mr Webster’s report and his recommendations, and of the next steps required by the council.“Mr Webster’s report will be published today as part of the papers for that council meeting, which will take place on Friday  February.”Carol Hamilton, SBC’s executive member for children and young people, added: “The report authored by Andrew Webster QC which will be published today is of acute interest to me and to many people across the Borders. Although the report addresses the response of the council as a whole, I will be considering the detail and paying particular attention to the recommendations as they apply to education.“For my part, I too am deeply saddened by contents of the report. It makes for very uncomfortable reading.“I am clearly sorry that the matters were not referred to the Child Protection Unit early on, and I am sorry that communication with the parents was so clearly wrong. It should never have happened and we should have done much better.“I will be working closely with my fellow Elected Members to fully consider the Independent Inquiry report, and to look at how we ensure the abuse experienced by these young people does not happen again. I offer my heartfelt apologies to these children for what they experienced.“Changes will inevitably follow such a major review, and we will provide further information on these as soon as we are able to do so.”"},{"url":null,"title":"hawick-teenager-appointed-royal-bank-rugbyforce-2021-young-ambassador","story":"A TEENAGE rugby player from Hawick has been appointed as a Royal Bank RugbyForce  Young Ambassador.Stephen Cook will promote the town as a fantastic community focused club for young players with a proud tradition of developing international stars.The programme will involve him utilising his role as a coach and referee of junior rugby across primary school, S, S and Under  levels by engaging with and inspiring the next generation of players.And now the Royal Bank in partnership with Scottish Rugby, are encouraging more ambitious --year-olds across the country to become ‘Young Ambassadors’, tackling the tough issues facing amateur clubs and their local communities.Following on from nationwide success last year, the programme is back for  and Royal Bank are looking to grow their support for the next generation of grassroots leaders with a squad of  ‘Young Ambassadors’, who will take on responsible committee positions at their clubs.Each winning candidate will also receive specialist training and mentoring to develop key skills for effective club management, including seminars and events lead by former Scotland Internationals Jim Hamilton and Rory Lawson.Stephen Cook in action Backing the campaign, Scotland international and Edinburgh Rugby player, Jamie Ritchie said: “Having had the chance to meet last year’s Young Ambassadors and to see first-hand the impact their projects are having, it’s great to see the programme back again for .“This is a really important time for the grassroots game as we recover and rebuild from the effects of the last  months.

It showed the important role amateur sport and local clubs play in supporting our communities, and, with the appetite so many young people showed in submitting their ideas and telling us what they did for their club or their towns, how passionate and committed they are to making a positive dference. It made choosing the final ten who were selected as Young Ambassadors a real challenge.

It’s essential that this continues.”And Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said “signicant dismantling” of the testing regime would be “inexcusable negligence given ongoing risks”.However it became clear on Monday that the devolved nations will need to cover the cost of universal free testing beyond April  themselves, should they think it necessary.Ms Sturgeon is expected to set out her new strategic framework for dealing with coronavirus on Tuesday.vw,vw,px, px\"Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon is expected to set out her new strategic framework for dealing with coronavirus on Tuesday She has said it would be “unacceptable” for public health decisions of the devolved administrations to be impacted by funding choices taken by the UK Government.There are currently no formal plans to end the self-isolation rules in Wales, which mean people with Covid have to remain at home for five full days anda negative lateral flow test on days five and six.However Welsh economy minister Vaughan Gething has said it is possible all Covid restrictions in the country could be lted by the end of March.Northern Ireland’s health minister Robin Swann said on Monday that his department would “carefully consider” the “living with Covid” plan unveiled in England.But he said no decisions had been taken on any changes to the country’s test and trace programme.People in Northern Ireland are still advised to self-isolatethey test positive for the virus, or they have been in contact with a positive case and are not vaccinated – although this is not legally-enforced.vw,vw,px, px\"Northern Ireland’s health minister Robin Swann – Does “living with Covid” mean it’s all over Sadly not.

opponents stood firm to claim three precious league points.A healthy crowd of almost  turned out in dreadful conditions, with gusts topping  miles per hour and intermittent sheets of freezing rain greeting those spectators who arrived to support the team.Refreshingly, though, a group of youngsters were amongst the entourage travelling with the north Glasgow visitors, and they soon felt at home, happily mixing with the Pupils# own young supporters and joining in song.First, an attempted Pupils clearance found its way to Finnart#s number , who kept his composure to slot home a close-range finish and make it two goals in two games against the Pupils.Then, a header from a swirling cross from Finnart#s left-hand side couldn#t be kept out, despite the efforts of Alasdair Ferguson in goal.The Pupils# Rhys Casci did go close with a one-on-one effort in the first half after being freed by a low pass from midfield, but the Tarbert-based player opted to shoot early and the keeper got his body in front of the effort and gathered at the second attempt.After the interval, the McFadyens-sponsored Pupils hoped to use the westerly tailwind to put pressure on the visitors# goal, but it was a quieter half than the hosts would have liked.Finnart battled to repel the Pupils, limiting them to two dangerous efforts from outside the box, first from Casci who forced a save from the away keeper to tip his low shot round the post for a corner, and then from Scott Souden whose deflected effort forced the keeper into a save.The Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils made some changes late on with youngster Andrew Renton and right-back Michael McKinlay making afrom injury, but it wasn’t enough to turn the tide of the game and the visitors took all three points, to leave themselves two points behind leaders Kilsyth Athletic with two games in hand.Conversely, the Pupils are three points adrt at the foot of the ision, but importantly have two games in hand themselves.In the aftermath of the game, the Pupils# management team stated they were satisfied with the effort and performance level of the squad, acknowledging that the dference between the sides on the day, despite the polar

He was protected well by right back Conner Brown, left back Burns and central defensive pairing Ross Souden and captain Keith Mitchell.With less than  minutes remaining, McCallum – who had shted into central midfield with the introduction of second sub and debutant Cameron Wylie at right midfield – intercepted a ball from a Glenvale player, his tackle putting Lang one on one with the hosts# keeper.Lang showed excellent composure for his tender years to slot the ball low into the net with his right foot, just inside the box, his teammates joining him in celebration.After seeing out the final five minutes of regulation time, four nervy minutes of added time were played as Glenvale pushed for an equaliser.In the st minute, Ferguson was called upon to make the save of the day, stopping a powerful Glenvale drive from  yards out, before a Pupils defender cleared the danger.The final whistle sounded soon after and the Pupils# squad and management could cheer a hard-earned, much-needed win, especially impressive considering the inexperience of much of the squad, who are still learning at this level, but judging by this showing, are certainly contributing.Tomorrow , the Pupils host high-flying Harmony Row from Govan, at Kintyre Park.Kick-off pm.

Avoid plantingthe ground is frozen or extremely waterlogged.Your planting hole should be no deeper than the roots, but at least three times the diameter of the root ball.It#s a good idea to soak bare-rooted trees for about  minutes before planting.Place the tree in the planting hole so the first flare of roots on the stem are level with the soil surface. If you plant the tree too deep, it can result in rot and disease.You may need to insert a stake for top heavy or larger trees. Refill the planting hole, firm gently and water in.Drought stress is common in newly-planted trees so make sure you keep watering throughout the growing season.

McCartney.The news came just as band members prepared to leave for Manchester to compete in the Boosey and Hawks National Youth Bass Band Championships.Paul McCartney, former member of the Beatles, was recently slated in the national press for refusing to sign the #Save Our Bands# petition.But this week he went a step further by writing stinging letters to both Dick Walsh, leader of Argyll and Bute Council, and Michael Forsyth MP, Secretary of State for Scotland.The future of the band is in jeopardy because Argyll and Bute Council has a shortfall of funding this year of more than £ million.As part of an enormous package of cuts aimed at saving money, the council plans to axe music tuition in all schools which would mean the end of the school band.In a support letter, Sir Paul describes the proposals to axe music tuition as #catastrophic# and urged the council to re-consider.He wrote: #I feel it would be disastrous for the area to lose this essential musical training, not only to the local people whose lives are enriched by music, but also for the tourism on which so much of the local economy depends.#Campbeltown and the surrounding district is famed throughout the world for its traditional music and it would be very unwise even to consider implementing measures which would effectively bring this reputation to an end.#He added: #I am lending my strongest support to the local people who are fighting to protect the teaching of music in their schools and I will urge the council to reconsider any plans they may have to implement these catastrophic and far reaching measures.#FIFTY YEARS AGOCampbeltown#s coal situation is worsening and now merchants have only one week#s supply left.The local firm of D McNair and Son announced earlier this week that it

has been using propane gas with the coal to stretch its supplies.#Unless more supplies are received after this period, all the gas will be off,# said a spokesman.As a result of the national strike, electricity cuts hit Campbeltown on Monday, bringing work at the Andrew Douglas clothing factory to a halt.The factory manager, Mr Harry Moffat, anticipating an early Monday morning power cut, called his employees to work on Saturday.#These cuts will definitely affect factory production, although I hope to get as many hours# work as possible between the cuts,# said Mr Moffat.A director of the local Golden Grain Bakery said that its production will also suffer because of the strike.#Every effort will be made to produce a full range of bakery products by switching daysht workers to night workcuts prevent day work,# he added.Campbeltown#s householders have also suffered great inconvenience due to the power cuts and this has resulted in a steady demand for candles in local shops.One of the most disappointing aspects of the power cut from the local teenagers# point of view was the cancellation of a dance on Monday evening.The dance was arranged specially for Valentine#s Day.SEVENTY

If you are sure you know something to be the case beyond contradiction, you don#t need faith.Doubt, on the other hand, is strongly linked with faith because, while you may have faith strong enough to move mountains, there is always the possibility your faith is misplaced.I would argue the existence of God is proven by large amounts of evidence, but in the end that is a matter of faith.The Bible recognises this right at the start where Adam and Eve leave the Garden of Eden and do not see God face-to-face anymore.From now on, they, and we who come after them, must live by faith.This is what it is to be human – and faith is always open to challenge.When suffering occurs, when disaster looms, people ask, #Where was God # and use what has happened to deny God exists.Yet the faithful keep believing. Why There have been many attempts by faithful people to explain unbearable tragedies with faith in a loving God. Few are convincing – at least at the time.For me, the love that people give to one another is God reflected in human goodness.Living by faith is not easy. Sometimes it means being assailed by doubts and I believe we must be honest about our questions.After all, did not Jesus say: #The truth will set you free.# When those most bitter and painful tragedies strike us down, faith can be a consolation – sometimes the only consolation – even as at the time it is tested to breaking point."},{"url":null,"title":"council considers cremation price rise","story":"Argyll and Bute already charges above the Scottish average for exclusive right of burial and coffin interment, but below the average for a cremation.

according to publishers, saw him “revelling in the liberating glories of surf, sand and their sensualities”.He said: “The funny thing is I have spent my le flying and people always ask me to write a book about flying and dferent places in my le.“There is a better story when I was leguarding.“It is more human and ied in some ways so I thought I would write about that, which I did.“Sometimes anecdotes come up when you have got a pint in your hand and somebody mentions something and it reminds you of something.“Often in the book, I draw on these anecdotes that I remember.“When you are younger, things stick in your memory for all your le.”Kenny grew up in Fairlie, in Ayrshire, before swapping Scotland’s west coast for the south-west of England.Water has played a key role in Kenny’s le, from surfing in Cornwall to becoming part of Dunbar Coastal Rowing Club.A director of Dunbar Harbour Trust, he penned All Summer Long during lockdown and described it as “a wonderful coming of age”.Whilst at university, he escaped westwards every summer to be a professional leguard on Sennen Beach in Whitesands Bay, West Cornwall.After graduating, he spent six months as a teacher in Barbados, and three more months hitchhiking through the USA, Canada and Alaska, then overland through Central America to ‘hidden’ Popayan in the Andes of Colombia.He would go on to learn to fly with British Airways and was later a flying instructor, working almost everywhere in the world, including China, Russia, France and India.He said: “When I was about , I said to my mother: ‘We always seem to live in beautul places.’“We have moved around several times and she said: ‘Any fool can live in a horrible place.’“Her attitude was ‘don’t try to get yourself the most wonderful house you can afford but the most beautul area you can afford, even in the most humble dwelling’.”All Summer Long is released at the end of the month, with the author pleased to say he had some positive reviews from family members.The Dunbar resident said: “I’m suffering from imposter syndrome at the moment where I think it is not me and should not be me but the people who have read it say don’t feel bad

If youre careful with your choices, you can see them move, emit scent when you brush your hands over them and even snap shutprey lands on their leaves.Houseplant lovers have captured the movement of many of the moving plants in timelapse videos, and not all of them are just moving towards the light.. Prayer plant The prayer plant, so called because it raises its leaves in the evening as though it is praying, is a great one to watch.\"Every night, the leaves roll up and you can hear them moving as well,\" says Claire Bishop, head of houseplants at Dobbies Garden Centres .\"They are great plants for kids, as theyre not toxic. And the fact you can see the plant alive and moving gets kids interested,\" she explains. \"Its one of the easiest plants to look after, but it actually looks stunning. It can double in size in a couple of months.\"Marantas prefer plenty of light, but not direct sunlight, along with well-drained soil and high humidity.. Mimosa pudicaAlso known as the sensitive plant, this one reacts to being tickled, as the leaflets close like dominoesyou run a finger down them or they are exposed to heat, while the whole stem collapsesyou touch it firmly. Its considered a weed in tropical countries, but give it plenty of sun and moderate watering, and you should keep it happy.. CalatheaClosely related to the maranta, these increasingly popular exotic-looking plants, often with colourful foliage and striking shape, are also known as peacock plants, and are similar to the prayer plant in that most of them move.\"Theres a particular type called the rattlesnake plant, whose leaves open and close every day, because their leaves need the sunlight. They will open up every day and then close back up again to conserve energy when it gets darker,\" Bishop says.Rattlesnake plants need bright indirect light. Water them when the top two inches of soil have dried out and dont use shine products on dusty leaves. Just wipe them occasionally with a damp cloth.. Venus fly trapThis carnivorous culprit is popular in homes, its leaves snapping shut when an unsuspecting insect climbs in to investigate and is promptly trapped in its vice-like grip and later digested. Its fussy about its food, preferring spiders, ants, beetles and grasshoppers, with a few flying insects thrown in.They need direct sunlight to remain healthy, otherwise their leaves will become weak and floppy. Plant them in a sandy, damp soil and water them with rain water, preferably sitting them in about cm of water, rather than watering them from the top.. AlocasiaIncreasingly popular among houseplant fans, because of their unusual shaped leaves and distinctive veins, these beauties spring visibly back to le after a good water.\"There are a lot of really unusual ones out there. Theres a beautul one called Pink Dragon with pink stems and unusual leaves,\" Bishop recommends.. PhilodendronYou may not see it move before your eyes, but play around with a time-lapse camera and you should enjoy the vast movement of the leathery leaves overnight.. Peperomia Clusiolia Red MarginFor those who prefer scent, houseplant specialist The Ginger Junglerecommends this moderately drought-tolerant candidate, whose leaves smell like sweet pepper. It prefers to be kept on the dry side, especially in lower light conditions so let the top of the soil dry out by a couple of inches before each watering.. MonsteraKnown as the Swiss cheese plant, this striking houseplant should make signicant growthyou put it in moderate brightness but out of direct sunlight. Winter brightness is essential, otherwise youll get spindly stalks and leggy growth.. Oxalis triangularisThis plant is particularly active because of its striking reactions to light changes. As it moves in response to light intensity, its look changes dramatically. Film them with a timelapse camera, and youll see how much they move towards the sunlight over a -hour period."},{"url":null,"title":"galleries-chance-see-audubons-extraordinary-birds-america","story":"Galleries: Your chance to see Audubon’s extraordinary Birds of AmericaAlice Wyllie of National Museums of Scotland admires a Carolina ParakeetYet captivating a British society enamoured of new worlds, and the New World in particular, Audubon’s lavishly illustrated series of imaginative ornithological mise-en-scene, from a flurry of mockingbirds attacking a rattlesnake in a tree to two peregrines feasting on a brace of duck, became hugely popular, and the extant  copies of The Birds of America are amongst some of the rarest books in the world.At a time when readers were used to stfly-posed natural history specimens – sometimes looking as leless as the taxidermy specimens they were based on – staring starkly out of the page, Audubon’s dramatic brilliance was thrilling.The enthusiastic reaction of the first engraver of the works, William Home Lizar, when he saw the peregrines on the easel at Audubon’s Edinburgh lodgings, “with bloody rags at their beaks’ ends and cruel delight in their daring eyes,” was representative. “I will publish this!”This, then, is the starting point for the touring exhibition from the National Museum of Scotland, a visually striking contextualisation of the hunger for knowledge that marked this particular point in history, painting a picture of a man whose myth was as vivid as his paintings.The heart of it is Audubon’s superb prints themselves –  large scale unbound prints taken from the museum’s larger collection, many of which have never been shown before.There’s a rare bound copy of The Birds of America itself, open on the page of a glorious snowy egret, on loan from the Mitchell Library, and taxidermy specimens from the museum’s collections. A series of small bird skins laid out as specimens to study shows the dichotomy of the methods of th century naturalists.There is the Ornithological Biography, a smaller scaled -page companion piece to Birds of America, with text written in conjunction with Audubon’s Scottish friend William McGillivray.Audubon had been fascinated with birds and drawing since he was a child, gradually honing his art and his observations of the ornithological world despite a series of failed business ventures after his father had sent him to America to avoid military conscription into Napoleon’s army.Audubon largely shot his specimens himself after close observation of their habits in the wild. Then using wire, he arranged them in an ingenious manner into naturalistic, occasionally outlandish poses, frequently,the size of bird allowed it on the page, using numerous smaller birds in imaginative poses to show dferent aspects of the wings or body for identication purposes.Elsewhere, larger birds, still le size, had to be crammed on to the cm tall pages in somewhat awkward yet inventive poses, showing a fine design eye that made the ornithological eye somewhat more subservient.For Audubon, too, it was about the myth-making, whether in the questionable attempts to pass off new birds – such as the infamous Bird of Washington, which wowed the British yet of which no specimen exists – or in his entertaining anecdotes and bird-watching memoirs, frequently embellished, but not entirely improbable.And yet his work brought to wider knowledge a number of species – more than  – which had previously been unknown to science. Others were misidentications, sometimes wilful or simply made up, so his peers believed, at others, the natural and unavoidable pitfalls that come from identying birds, with their wildly ying plumage at dferent times of year or le, in the wild, coupled with a certain arrogance and belief in his own myth.“No man living has studied [birds] as much as I have done!”, he claimed, smarting at the rejection of the “establishment” in his early career. Other naturalists bristled, but kings and the captivated continued to subscribe to his work – and on the walls here, you can very much see why.Audubon’s Birds of America, National Museum of Scotland, Chambers Street, Edinburgh,    www.nms.ac.uk Until  May, Daily am–pm, Adult £ Under  and Museum members, Free – concessions available.Critics ChoiceAn exhibition predicated on Dusk is Andrew Mackenzies second solo showing at Edinburghs gallery. Filled with the darkness of trees, this is silhouette and frame, the gloom of dimly-viewed landscape, the stark contrast of fluoro-bright framing within the frame, as familiar from his earlier work. There are trees here familiar from any woodland walk, the ash, Scots pine, elder and birch all in their distinctive, stark winter outline- reservoirs too, and the subtle changes of the darkening light.“Dusk is the darker stage of twilight,” says Mackenzie, who says that he often has a rough idea of what hes going to paint, inspired by his local woodland surroundings in the Borders, but that the piece evolves as he goes along. “The sense of dusk emerged from the paintings as I made them.”“Dusk is my favourite time of the day, partly because it is a transitional time, a threshold between day and night. I don’t associate it with melancholy, but instead love the way colours deepen shapes and forms simply as the light is limited. I like the way your eyes adjust to the light as it fades.” He associates it, too, with childhood, and his adult experience of walking in the woods when his then small children were in bed. “Being out at that time of day, and experiencing the world get dark, is an important part of growing up.” His paintings, he says, involve closer looking, both his own, and – hopefully – the viewers, an investigation of the state of being that is the “inbetween”.Andrew Mackenzie: Dusk, gallery,  Dundas Street, Edinburgh,   , www.andgallery Until  Mar, Tues – Fri, am – pm Sat am – pm and by appointmentDont MissVibrant, diaphanous, painted yet sculpted, constructed, scrunched and assembled, the paintings draped around the walls of the Modern Institute this week are the work of the American painter, Suzanne Jackson, here showing in her first solo exhibition at the gallery. “In Natures Way” is a play on words, as well as texture and form, as she writes it in her introduction to the show, “On my mind all year, in this work for Glasgow.

Nevertheless, the process also put data-driven decision-making front and centre of the public consciousness.Brian Hills, interim chief executive of The Data Lab, believes this is an important and often overlooked factor in the digital transformation taking place across the economy.“Every day we have been talking about data with governments giving out the latest statistics around Covid, so everybody starts to become familiar with ‘here’s the data, here’s the decisions being made’, and people have become accustomed to the use of data in helping organisations make decisions,” he explains. “It is a step-change that is going to continue.”Set up in  as part of Scotland’s network of innovation centres, The Data Lab is charged with driving growth of articial intelligenceand data science skills across the academic and business community.Mr Hills assumed the top role on an interim basis at the beginning of this year, and has his hat in the ring for the permanent appointment. He originally joined The Data Lab as head of product and data before advancing to deputy chief executive in June .: Ethics and values should be at forefront of decision-makingBorn in Glasgow and raised in the Highlands, Mr Hills began his career at what was then known as HP in South Queensferry in  after completing his master’s degree in computing at the University of Aberdeen. He later worked for nearly eight years at Sumerian, the Glasgow-based networked applications group founded by David Sibbald, and then joined travel search website Skyscanner in  where he created the Edinburgh-based firm’s business intelligence unit.From an initial team of , The Data Lab has grown to  people working across bases in Edinburgh, Glasgow, Aberdeen and Inverness. Its mission is to help Scotland “maximise value from data and lead the world to a data-powered future”.“For us fundamentally it’s about changing lives,” Mr Hills said.“How do we create the skills that enable people to have the careers they want to have in this area  How do we use data and collaboration across academia, industry and public sectors to innovate new products across ranges of dferent sectors ”Backed by government money provided through the Scottish Funding Council and Scottish Enterprise, The Data Lab also periodically receives one-off funding directly from the Scottish Government for specic projects. Examples include TORCH, which launched in  as a “matchmaking” service to help businesses with limited technical experience make better use of their data.: Data harvesting will reap climate rewardsOne of last year’s TORCH clients, Mercat Tours, decided to use the suspension of its Edinburgh walking tours during lockdown to consolidate its operations into a single IT system. The company also upskilled eight of its team members through the Data Skills for Work programme.“They saw that as a key competency that they need in their business going forward,” Mr Hills said. “Now they are a lot more operationally efficient and can scale up what they do as more visitors come back to Edinburgh.”As the acceleration of the digital transformation driven by the pandemic has pushed demand for data skills to unprecedented highs, the challenge for “’everybody in the ecosystem” is to not only train up the next generation but also unlock talent among existing workers.The Data Lab advises there are three key components to attracting new data employees: articulate a clear set of company values provide a straightforward explanation of the problems to be solved and outline the opportunities for professional growth and career advancement.“We also talk about the fourth alternative of upskilling people that are already in your company,” Mr Hills said. “It is quite expensive in time and money to go through a hiring process in a very competitive market, so can you take advantage of the ious upskilling schemes that are available to invest in your existing team ”There has been an increase in the number of firms taking up this fourth option, he said, but much more could still be done in this area. There has also been an uptick in the number of more mature workers retraining for data jobs in sectors such as healthcare because they believe it will have a materially positive effect on society.“We are seeing a trend that people want to pivot in their careers,” Mr Hills said. “I think people are taking a step back to see what they really want to do with their lives.“We are certainly seeing that in a lot of people who are mature in their careers – whatever you phrase mature as – who are really interested in making a change and doing something that they feel passionately about.”What countries have you most enjoyed travelling to, for business or leisure, and why It has to be Canada – my we is Canadian so I have to be specic and say Nova Scotia. Amazing country and people, we can’t wait to get on the first direct flight from Glasgow in the summer.When you were a child, what was your ideal job  Why did it appeal Growing up in the Highlands, I spent most of my youth playing golf at Tain Golf Club and would have loved to have been a professional golfer – I couldn’t quite get down to single figures though. After a break of many years I rediscovered golf during the pandemic and enjoy it even more now.What was your biggest break in business I wouldn’t say there was one specic break. I’ve been fortunate to work with some of the best tech leaders in Scotland, from the early days at HP through to Sumerian, Skyscanner and of course, most recently, with Gillian Docherty at The Data Lab.What was your worst moment in business During the financial crash in a small business when people I’d worked closely with for a long time were made redundant. Now as a leader I know there is no easy way to do this, but it felt brutal.Who do you most admire and why After the past two years it has to be those who work in our health service.

Her determination to crush the trade unions, especially the miners’ union, was another example of her extreme stubbornness.He tells us that the more women are involved in leading a society, the less militarily aggressive the society is. Mrs Thatcher said that “there is no such thing as society”. Mrs Thatcher ordered the sinking of the Belgrano, with massive loss of le, an act of military aggression for which she never displayed any remorse. She may not have been typical among female world leaders but the attitudes, opinions and actions of female British home secretaries in recent years have not displayed much sign of compassion.Following in Mrs Thatcher’s footsteps we’ve seen pictures of Ruth Davidson posing on a tank and now it’s over to Liz Truss to keep up the tradition. The image of a politician, whether man or woman, posing with a tank does not suggest “less militarily aggressive” to me.David Clark, Tarbolton.FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION AT RISKROSEMARY Goring’s article about the debate over slaverywas a helpful contribution to discussion of an issue that is threatening one of the fundamental values of our culture, freedom of expression.There are a number of issues where levels of vitriol and aggression are successfully closing down the ability to freely discuss issues, not by state censorship but by a kind of self-righteous and intolerant certainty that is redolent of the approach taken in the past by religious orthodoxy in its attacks upon blasphemy and heresy.Two other examples in addition to that mentioned by Ms Goring are the use of allegations of transphobia associated with discussion of transgender issues and the use of anti-Semitism allegations in connection with discussion of the politics of the state of Israel. In both these cases, people, including academics, offering articulate and well-reasoned positions that do not make any offensive comment or propose discriminatory or unjust treatment in relation to trans or Jewish people are successfully persecuted, losing jobs and suffering intolerable harassment.The case of Katherine Stock, who lost her position as a professor of philosophy at the University of Sussex for publishing a closely argued and thoughtful text that disagreed with the required orthodoxy on the trans issue is a scandalous example of the former.And the case of the Jewish members of the Labour Party who have been expelled for anti-Semitism or otherwise facing anti-Semitism chargesfor their comments on the policies of the state of Israel, is a preposterous example of the latter.The lobbies in both these caseshave realised that terrorising opposing points of view is a very effective form of censorship since most people will not wish to risk straying into such areas given the potential consequences.One of the cardinal values defining our culture, the freedom to express opinions in tolerant debate and discussion, is very sadly being lost.Stephen Smith, Glasgow.GET OUT OF MALLS, ON TO THE STREETSI CONFESS to a hearty dislike of aimless shopping generally and doing it in a mall in particular, so was interested in discussion on the future of Glasgow’s “Style Mile” . By all means repurpose the malls to something.Most of my pleasure in being in the city centre is doing necessary shopping in the relatively fresh air of the street with the endless entertainment afforded by the theatre of my fellow punters going about their business. The only blight is the rain, so why not examine the cost of canopies for the pedestrian areas of the three streets, with incentives for retailers to move out of the malls into the many vacant shops The Victorians who built the city centre also built many fine examples to copy. Then we would have the boons of fresh air, shelter from the wet, street entertainment, decent shops and a low virus-risk environment for a cost that must be less than construction costs of large unpleasant buildings.John Murdoch, Innellan.MY DISMAY OVER BURRELL CHANGESI NOTE Clare Henry’s article about the re-opening of the Burrell . I am sorry to read they have taken away the original doorway at the entrance. It is ridiculous to suggest it was off-putting.I do not like what I have seen of the huge stairway. It was sad to read they have removed a lot of the archways, which in my opinion made the Burrell such a brilliant place to visit.

Once when going to a social at the Methodist Youth Club,and only having one pair of Aristoc nylons left to wear, and those being seamless, I asked our next-door neighbourshe would draw seams up my legs with her eyebrow pencil, or whatever she used herself.Then there was school with which to cope ... the long-stockings we were allowed to wear in the sixth form were putty-coloured thick lisle ones definitely passion-killers but they were a distinct improvement on the three-quarter- grey socks which we hauled up to just above our knees, and held there with circulation-blocking elastic bands. It was good to leave all that teenage nonsense behind.Unbelievably,I was teenager now I would be wearing those thick, black things that look like leggings.

And the Scotland head coach refutes the notion that he has been the catalyst for the wave of optimism that has swept across the national team.“I’m not sure I changed the mentality of Scottish football: it was my team,” he told the High Performance podcast. “Out on the pitch the supporters engage with the players, not me. I’m very dficult to engage with!“I don’t look for credit, it doesn’t bother me. Everyone likes to be loved, everyone wants to be appreciated butthe credit doesn’t come then it doesn’t come. I can live with that. As long as I can go to my bed and know that I’m doing the right things, that I’m good at what I do and that I have the love and support of my family – that’s enough for me.“I definitely underestimated [the sht in mentality that was required] and it was something we had to shake. We ended up shaking it in the most Scottish way that you could.“I thought we were magnicent for  minutes in the play-off with Serbia and then they get one last corner. You think, ‘Come on lads, just defend it’. But no, we concede a goal. You think, ‘here we go again, Scotland and glorious failure’ because up until we conceded, I thought the performance was as good as anything I’d seen from a Scottish team going away to a dficult opponent.“You’re on the sidelines thinking ‘surely not again’ because I don’t think we would have recovered from thatwe hadn’t qualied. I certainly couldn’t have because I know how close we were and how well we had played.“The last thing I said to them [before kick-off] was that there were  of them in the room but only one person had been to a major final with his country, and unfortunately he’s not Scottish. It was [coach] Steven Reid, who went to the World Cup with Ireland as a player. I said, ‘this is your chance to go and do it, don’t burden yourself with what’s happened before because we can’t affect what’s happened before’.“The last thing I said to them was ‘don’t play with the fear of failure, try to play with the anticipation of success’. I think we did that up until that goal. After that we clung on and I was worried for them.“That’s when you start to hear [Andy] Robertson, [John] McGinn, Kenny McLean, Ryan Jack, Callum McGregor: ‘we’re still in the competition, we can still get through’. That desire was still there so as a coach, I’m thinking that we’re all right because I didn’t have to say too much. They did it.”Clarke is in no doubt that his squad is blessed with natural leaders, with many prominent players plying their trade in the English Premier League. Mixing it with some of the world’s best players on a weekly basis, Clarke says, brings a welcome swagger to the team.“McGinn and Robertson bring personality,” he added. “The boys that play in the Premier League bring an assuredness to the squad.“Robertson has won the Champions League and the Club World Cup, [Kieran] Tierney is down there playing now, Scott McTominay isn’t shy of confidence. They bring an assuredness to the squad that everyone  buys into.“You’ve got the captain of Celtic, you’ve got a future captain at Arsenal, captain Andy playing at Liverpool, McTominay could be a captain at United, McGinn could be a captain anywhere. You’ve got leaders like Grant Hanley, who is the captain of Norwich.“We’ve got so many good people in the squad and that has also been a process, getting people in and selling them on the idea we can be successful. You’ve got to get that over to them.”"},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/13498242.jpg?type=article-full","title":"glasgow-city-chambers-evacuated-due-suspicious-package","story":"The parcel was left in the east wing of the building, causing an evacuation of staff. One eyewitness said: “A man came into reception at the east side of the Chambers and sat down a red toolbox before walking out.”Police are currently on the scene and the main section of the building is currently in lockdown. Interesting city chambers police shut it off pic ZMNrYIuIA Glasgow City Council spokesperson said: “The building has been evacuated as a precaution.”An event to mark  days since the COP climate summit - including dozens of school children - was being held in the Banqueting Hall of the Chambers. It is understood the showcase finished just minutes before the bomb threat and the  guests at the climate change event had left the building just before the lockdown.One staff member said: “We didn’t know what was happening, we were just told we had to get out as fast as possible. “It was very calm and done quickly but quite worrying. “It’s not how I expected my day at work to end.”Glasgow City Chambers has been evacuated, reportedly as a precaution after a “suspicious package” was found.Police are on the scene and have taped off several sides of the building. pic ZvYvnPnly A Police Scotland spokesperson said: \"We received a report of a suspicious package at the City Chambers, George Square, Glasgow around .pm on Monday,  February, .\"Officers attended alongside other emergency services and a cordon has been put in place.\"Part of the building has been evacuated as a precaution.\"Enquiries to establish the full circumstances are ongoing.\""},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/13012776.jpg?type=article-full","title":"covid-scotland-second-covid-booster-jab-offered-groups","story":"The vaccines will be offered to all of those aged  and over and those at highest risk of complications from Covid- following the latest joint committee on vaccination and immunisation advice.To protect those groups a spring booster dose will be offered at least  weeks after the last vaccine dose to:The first appointments will be offered to these groups from March.Health Secretary Humza Yousaf said: “We know that these high priority groups are at higher risk of serious illness from COVID-, and I therefore welcome the further advice from the JCVI and confirm Scotland will offer a further dose to these people from next month.“Vaccination has been our most effective tool against coronavirus, and that will continue to be the case.

I said straight after the game to the players it was a good performance, well-deserved.“They got their reward with a good win, but it’s just one win. We need plenty more of them, but I think they should enjoy it because they deserved it.“It gets parked quickly in my thoughts and it gets parked quickly in the players’. Certainly this morning we’re ready to go again. That’s the way it is.”Dyche has shown no signs of panic throughout Burnley’s recent -game winless league run and stressed his players had always “been in a good place”.He said his side’s performance levels had improved signicantly since they bounced back from a disappointing defeat at Leeds with a goalless draw at Arsenal last month.He said: “We’ve been building on the back of that Arsenal performance I think by finding the basic structure of what we do, certainly the energy – outstanding.“I’ve said many times, in the second half of the season, statistically we’re very strong physically and how we go about our performance levels.“The last three games we’ve been kind of seven or eight kilometres in front of the opposition. That’s a big sht from these players.“They’re putting that in week in, week out all of a sudden. They weren’t a million miles away from that, but we weren’t on top of our stats like we normally are like we have been the last five games.“It doesn’t guarantee you a win, but it gives you a whole better chanceyou’re physically right.”Dyche said he expected January signing Wout Weghorst, who scored his first goal for the club at Brighton, and Maxwel Cornet to recover in time to face Tottenham after both were withdrawn on Saturday with minor injuries.He was still waiting to learn whether James Tarkowski and Ashley Westwood will be available. They have been isolating due to Covid- and hope to test negative on Tuesday.Charlie Taylor is hoping toto contention for next weekend’s game at Crystal Palace after recovering from a foot injury.We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Subject to Parliamentary approval, the Government is axing the legal obligation to isolate after a positive test from February .However, the official public health advice will remain that people testing positive for the virus should stay at home for five days. This includes both adults and children.Crucially, this guidance will not be enforced by law.The Government will also no longer ask vaccinated contacts, and those under , to test for seven days, and will remove the legal requirement for contacts who are not vaccinated to self-isolate.Meanwhile, there will be an end to routine contact tracing. vw,vw,px, px\"Free universal coronavirus testing will end for the general public in England from April  – Can I still get free Covid tests For now, yes. But this is changing at the beginning of April.Mr Johnson hinted on Sunday that provision for free tests could not continue at their current rate due to the cost of £ billion a month.We now know that free universal symptomatic and asymptomatic testing will end for the general public in England from April .Remaining symptomatic testing will be focused on the most vulnerable, with the UK Health Security Agencyset to determine the details.This is expected to include people over the age of  and the immunosuppressed.A degree of asymptomatic testing will also be maintained in the most risky settings, such as in social care.Mr Johnson’s administration has been warned by critics that the public could be left “flying blind” on Covidleft without free testing provision.The UKHSA will maintain an appropriate level of lab infrastructure to be able to dial back up PCR testing, should this be needed.It will also maintain a stockpile of LFTs for a surge in usagerequired.Covid- has not gone away, but because of the efforts we have made as a country over the past two years we can now move from government regulations to personal responsibility.Read our plan for living with Covid ⬇️— UK Prime MinisterFebruary , – So how much will I have to pay for tests The Government expects a market for lateral flow devices to develop once boxes are no longer available free on the NHS, with inidual tests expected to cost a few pounds.To prevent people stockpiling them before April , iniduals will only be able to order a box of tests on the NHS every three days instead of every  hours.– What is happening with support payments From February , the Government is planning to end self-isolation payments and some of the practical support that accompanies them.Currently, people in England on low incomes can claim £ in financial supportthey are forced to isolate after testing positive for Covid or coming into contact with someone who has. This provision will come to an end on Thursday.Next month, from March , the Government is intending to reverse changes to statutory sick payand employment support allowance designed to help people through the Covid crisis.– Will I be asked to get another vaccine A spring booster vaccine will be offered across the UK to those aged  and over, older care home residents, and those over  who are immunosuppressed.➡️ https:t.co GZbFAiKnN pic dVEOgsgh— UK Prime MinisterFebruary , People aged  and over, the immunosuppressed and those living in care homes will be offered another Covid- booster vaccine this spring.Health Secretary Sajid Javid said on Monday that the top-up jab will help those at the highest risk of serious illness maintain a high level of protection against the virus.The NHS in England will offer people the jab from around six months after their last dose, with further details due to be set out shortly.In interim guidance published for planning purposes, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisationsaid a further dose for older people and those at risk is likely to be needed this autumn.This is because, although vaccines offer strong protection, their effectiveness does wane over time and Covid surges are expected in winter.The autumn jab campaign is expected to cover a wider group of people than in the spring and could include any new Covid vaccines that are available.– What about the devolved nations If this is correct, it’s catastrophic for the UK’s ability to ensure adequate Covid surveillance, outbreak management etc in future. To allow signicant dismantling of the testing infrastructure built up in last  years would be inexcusable negligence given ongoing risks. https:t.co kuZOrYEQt— Nicola SturgeonFebruary , Mr Johnson’s plan applies only to England, but that does not mean it will not affect Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland in any way.One major development is the end to free universal testing in April, which will prove controversial with devolved leaders.Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford said prior to Monday’s announcement that it would be “premature and reckless” to wind back the programme, adding: “Testing has played a pivotal role in breaking chains of transmission and as a surveillance tool helping us detect and respond to emerging iants. It’s essential that this continues.”And Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said “signicant dismantling” of the testing regime would be “inexcusable negligence given ongoing risks”.However it became clear on Monday that the devolved nations will need to cover the cost of universal free testing beyond April  themselves, should they think it necessary.Ms Sturgeon is expected to set out her new strategic framework for dealing with coronavirus on Tuesday.She has said it would be “unacceptable” for public health decisions of the devolved administrations to be impacted by funding choices taken by the UK Government.There are currently no formal plans to end the self-isolation rules in Wales, which mean people with Covid have to remain at home for five full days anda negative lateral flow test on days five and six.However Welsh economy minister Vaughan Gething has said it is possible all Covid restrictions in the country could be lted by the end of March.Northern Ireland’s health minister Robin Swann said on Monday that his department would “carefully consider” the “living with Covid” plan unveiled in England.But he said no decisions had been taken on any changes to the country’s test and trace programme.People in Northern Ireland are still advised to self-isolatethey test positive for the virus, or they have been in contact with a positive case and are not vaccinated – although this is not legally-enforced. vw,vw,px, px\"Northern Ireland’s health minister Robin Swann – Does “living with Covid” mean it’s all over Sadly not. Mr Johnson said at a Downing Street press conference on Monday evening that “we should be clear that the pandemic is not over”, warning “there may be signicant resurgences”.Meanwhile, Sir Patrick Vallance, the Government’s chief scientic adviser, said Covid will continue to evolve over the next couple of years, and there is no guarantee that future iants will be less severe.He said it is essential to maintain a virus surveillance system, the capacity to “ramp up” measures again quickly and to protect the vulnerable.“This pandemic is not over. The virus is continuing to evolve. It will continue to do so quite fast probably for the next couple of years,” he said.“There is no guarantee that the next iant is as reduced severity as Omicron.“The change in severity is a random by-product. We expect there to be further iants and they could be more severe.”We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

This falls in with ‘Candlemas’ on nd February as a Christian festival and a traditional end of the Christmas season. Candlemas commemorates the presentation of the infant Jesus at the Temple in Jerusalem as described in St Luke’s Gospel and when some denominations bring candles to their church. Candlemas is also one of the so-called ‘Quarter-days’ marking the changing seasons of winter, spring, summer and autumn. It is followed by Whitsun, Lammas Day and Martinmas as the term-days with their administrative and legal implications for the payment of rents and flittings. Saint Bride or Saint Bridget has been one of the most popular of the saints of the celtic church. Of course, there were many ‘Bridgets’, but the one whose festival date is on st February was ‘Bridget of Kildare’ in Leinster whose death was dated to AD . Bridget was one of the patron saints of Ireland and is remembered in the tradition of plaiting rush crosses around st February to set over doors and windows to protect the home from fire and other danger.   or the endearing ‘Bride’s little fosterling’.’ . ‘Bride’s Day, the birthday of spring’. century, traditions of Saint Bride were collected by Alexander Carmichael among his prayers, hymns, blessings and charms from the Hebrides. He suggests that accounts of Saint Bride were not easily recovered and summarised the tradition: ‘The serpent is supposed to emerge from its hollow among the hills on St Bride’s Day, and a propitiatory hymn was sung to it. Only one verse of this hymn has been obtained, apparently the first. It dfers in dferent localities: [Early on Bride’s mornThe serpent shall come from the hole, I shall not molest the serpent, Nor will the serpent molest me.’ The snake is a powerful element in mythology and religion and a creature to be respected as the ‘hymn’ makes clear. Familiar in the snake coiled round the rod, it is a symbol of medicine and healing, and the appearance of the adder or snake on Saint Bride’s Day offers a feeling of hope and transformation, and of turning the corner with the ening of the days. . century. .!... !"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Donnie-Munro-picture-scaled.jpg","title":"special donnie munro concert to bring skye live back with a","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe island#s premier music festival is set toin style on Thursday th May # following a two-year break due to the pandemic # with an opening night extravaganza # ‘Coming Home: An Evening with Donnie Munro and friends’ and featuring special guests in the form of multi-award-winning Gaelic supergroup Mànran.The show will be Donnie’s first in his hometown since  and will see him perform with a full eight-piece band line-up on the spectacular Skye Live Festival site at Am Meall in Portree. The singer said: #This offers me a fantastic opportunity to bring this amazing line-up, featuring some of Scotland’s top musicians together, for an exclusive performance to open this year’s Skye Live Festival.He added: #It has been fantastic to watch the festival grow in strength, year on year, in what must be one of the most special and unique festival locations anywhere in the world, and to see it become internationally recognised as, ‘one of the best boutique festivals in the country’, is just fantastic for the island, and it is such a great honour for me to be invited to be a part of it all and to be bringing the music back home here to where it all began.#Joining Donnie Munro on the night will be Mànran, internationally recognised as one of the most iconic and respected Scottish bands on the road today.

Women are more likely to ditch their partner than their pet, found a poll for nationwide pet retailer Jollyes. Asked about their relationship with their partner and their pet and which one they would ditch first,  per cent said they would ditch their partner against  per cent who would ditch their pet. Men were more loyal to their partners, with  per cent saying they would ditch their pet and  per cent saying they would ditch their partner. Overall,  per cent would ditch their partner first and  per cent said the pet would go first. The study was carried out by Jollyes to gauge humans’ attitudes to romance and relationships as it launches the search on social media for a canine couple to take part in a romantic dinner for two at its doggy dates diner, “C’est Jollyes”, open for one day only on  February at its Runcorn store in Cheshire . Two dogs will get the chance to enjoy a three course dinner featuring a menu from Jollyes Artisan Lestage range including angus beef with sweet potato, venison and salmon, and duck with sweet potato. The survey showed some big dferences in attitudes to pets and partners around the UK. People in North East England were more likely to ditch their partnerover their pet, followed by London , Northern Ireland , South West . [See table in editor’s notes below for regional breakdown.] Owners were asked what they loved most about their pets, with loyalty, unconditional love, loving nature, affection and a warm heart among the qualities cited. No matter how much love an animal gives, most pet ownerswould prefer a romantic Valentine’s night with their partner than one spent with their pet. Of male respondents,  per cent chose a night with their partner, compared with  per cent of female respondents. The figures were broadly similar across the country. Among the other popular traits cited by pet owners were: “they are so loyal and loving. And cute!” “unconditional love and loyalty” “they comfort me when I’m feeling blue” “doesnt argue or answer back” “they always cheer me up” “waggy tail and warm heart” and “her loving nature, always there for me when I need her”. One said: “Sometimes playful, sometimes cuddly, intelligent, independent, sometimes dangerous. All rather like my partner really.” Not everyone was totally enamoured with their pet. One said: “Nothing, it hates me, only loves my we”. And not all pets’ traits would make for a romantic night out – one said: “hassle free”, another said “doesn’t answer back” and one said “it’s a tortoise and he’s as indferent to use as we are to him”. Phil Turner-Naylor, head of marketing at Jollyes, said: “We’re known as a nation of animal lovers and this goes to prove it. When it comes to relationships, a lot people would choose their pet over their partner. “The good news for romantics though is that a big majority choose people over pets. What it does show, especially for men, is that partners have to work hard to keep the romance going or they might find themselves in the dog house. Women are looking for a romantic night with their partner on Valentine’s, butthe men don’t get it right, they had better watch out.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1645089617694.jpg--1_700_people_apply_for_a_life_less_ordinary_with_stena_line.jpg?1645089617000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20220217news1 700 people apply for a life less ordinary with stena line","story":"Ferry company Stena Line has been overwhelmed with the positive response from the public to its recent recruitment campaign ‘A Le Less Ordinary’, which aims to fill  vacant positions onboard its Irish Sea ferries. , applications were received from people across the UK and Republic of Ireland.

And as we approached the house she gave me a wee nudge and said ‘do these people know we are visiting ’.”After a fall at home she was taken into hospital and was later diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease.Hannah had always said she wanted to be cared for at home and Mervyn was determined to honour her wishes. He juggled caring for her with his full-time job, assisted by a home help and carers who visited daily.It took an emotional toll on him, and he found himself getting exasperated by his mum losing or forgetting things, but after accepting she had a ‘disease of the mind’ things became easier.“People would say to me you’re doing a great thing looking after your mother, but to me it was duty that I was happy to do. But I did wish I had another sibling to share it with. I did have an older brother, Robert Samuel Strahan Currie, but he died in infancy.“At the start, caring for my mother was very, very hard. But I had to come to terms with the fact she had a disease of the mind.“It’s like a net curtain comes down and you see you loved one, but you can’t really talk to them.“People have said it’s like looking after the living dead because it can feel like they’re not getting any benefit of all the things you do for them.“But when she died it was still very dficult. I thought because she had Alzheimer’s that I wouldn’t miss her so much, but the loss was still very big as we had drawn so close.“If someone said to me ‘you can have her back but she’ll still have Alzheimer’s’ I’d still want her back.“Despite all the trials that a single carer experiences I count that particular role in my le as being the most rewarding of all. It was a privilege and honour and to have God’s blessing and strength.”Mervyn, who volunteered to help at two vaccination centres during the pandemic, decided to volunteer as a steward for this year’s Alzheimer’s Society Belfast GLOW Walk to help other people who are caring for a loved one with dementia.He will join people of all ages and walking abilities for a colourful around walk from The Titanic Quarter along the River Lagan and past many historical locations.Participants are encouraged to dress in neon, bring glow sticks and sport their brightest outfits to raise funds and awareness for the , people living with dementia in Northern Ireland.There’s never been a more important time for Belfast residents to glow the distance and come together to raise vital funds for le-changing dementia support. Alzheimer’s Society’s services, including the Dementia Connect support line, have been used over six million times since the start of the pandemic but too many people are still facing dementia alone.Bernadine McCrory, Alzheimer’s Society Northern Ireland Country Director said: “We would like to thank Mervyn and all of our amazing volunteers who helping us with the GLOW event this March.“Belfast GLOW is a fabulous opportunity to make memories with family and friends, all while raising money and awareness for the , living with dementia across Northern Ireland who continue to be disproportionally hit by the pandemic.“Nobody should have to face dementia alone without adequate support. That’s why we’re urging the people of Belfast to shine a light on dementia alongside your family and friends this March and help make a dference in the fight against dementia.“Every pound raised will help Alzheimer’s Society provide vital information and support, improve care, fund research and create lasting change for people affected by the condition.” Help create a brighter future for people affected by dementia alongside family and friends at Alzheimer’s Glow Belfast at the Titanic Quarter on  March.at alzheimers.org.uk glow "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1564499438658.jpg--agri_food_leaders_call_on_stormont_to_follow_the_science_on_climate_change_legislation.jpg?1564499438000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20220221newsagri food leaders call on stormont to follow the science on climate change legislation","story":"Industry leaders within the agri-food supply chain have said thatpassed unchanged, the Executive Climate Change Bill would have devastating consequences, including job losses, for the Northern Ireland economy. The damage done to local food production will require a reliance on food imports that would exacerbate global emissions and increase prices for the consumer. The impact would be particularly felt in rural towns and communities who depend on the sector for their livelihoods. They are calling on Assembly MLAs to recty the Bill by making meaningful amendments that are in line with the scientic evidence and that support their local communities who rely on the sector for their livelihoods. The organisations behind this warning are the Dairy Council for Northern Ireland the Northern Ireland Food  Drink AssociationNorthern Ireland Grain Trade Association , Northern Ireland Meat Exporters Association , the Livestock and Meat Commission , the Ulster Farmers Union . Speaking on behalf of this supply chain alliance, Conall Donnelly, Chief Executive of NIMEA said: “To be very clear, our collective members are in support of Climate Change legislation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. We want to play our part. We are already investing in and implementing carbon-reducing technologies right across our supply chain and will continue to do so. Because of our natural grass advantage, we already have a world-class reputation for sustainable food production. Our high-quality beef, lamb and dairy produce is reared with care on small family farms utilising natural grass and is the envy of many countries around the world. We believe Northern Ireland has the potential to be a shining light in sustainable food production. We want to work with policy makers to get this right for the environment and the local economy. That means having realistic and science-based climate change targets relevant to Northern Ireland so that we can continue to be part of the solution to climate change.” David Brown, Deputy President of the UFU said, “ passed without further amendments, this legislation would not follow the expert advice from scientists that make up the International Panel of Climate Change and the UK’s Climate Change Committee. It could unnecessarily obliterate tens of thousands of jobs as well as threaten consumer access to affordable, quality food. Perversely, food may need to be imported from where which would simply increase global emissions. “This Bill also has the potential to damage rural towns and communities who depend on our sector for their livelihoods. But it will affect us all as consumers when we are no longer able to access local fresh food that is produced to high environmental and animal welfare standards. We are asking politicians to work with us. We want to tackle climate change in a way that helps protect the environment and maintains the unique economic and social role that agriculture and food production has on this island.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1645454612923.jpg--covid_19___mon_21st_february_figures.jpg?1645454612000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20220221newscovid 19 mon 21st february figures","story":"The NI Department of Health dashboard shows four further coronavirus related death and , new positive test results.

She questioned how the virus will be tracked, how vulnerable people will be protected and whether a new, potentially more virulent, strain of Covid emerges.Read More ways to stay safe as we get to grips with living with CovidHealth Minister Robin Swann said: “My Department continues to keep all aspects of the Covid- test and trace programme in Northern Ireland under review to ensure it remains proportionate and effective.“Our key priorities for testing include ensuring that it is prioritised for those who need it most. It is also imperative that we have appropriate contingency planning in place, with flexible testing capability which can be rapidly deployed to respond to any future iants or seasonal surges.Robust surveillance systems must also be maintained, to ensure any new developments in the pandemic are swtly detected.“Keeping the public safe, in particular those at highest risk of severe illness, will continue to be at the centre of our considerations. Any policy changes will be informed by the latest clinical and scientic advice and consideration of the Covid situation in Northern Ireland.”The Minister also highlighted the importance of a cautious approach due to the continuing high numbers of daily infections and the continued pressure on hospitals.He said: “Covid- remains a serious health risk, particularly for those who are vulnerable. It is vital that we do not let our guard down. We can all help to keep the people close to us safe by continuing to make safer choices and following the latest guidance.”The current guidance to reduce the spread of COVID- includes getting vaccinated and boosted andwearing face coverings in health and social care settings, on public transport and in enclosed indoor settings.Read MoreLegal isolation for Covid to end from Thursday, Boris Johnson saysSDLP Leader Colum Eastwood has described an end to free Covid- testing for large numbers of people as an “unconscionable betrayal” of all those who have followed public health advice for the last two years.The Foyle MP said that dismantling the free testing programme would undermine efforts to bring transmission under control and would hurt low-income families most.Colum Eastwood MP added: “Any attempt to dismantle the Covid- testing infrastructure would be an unconscionable betrayal of everyone who has stuck with the public health guidance over the last two years to keep their friends, family and communities safe.“It shows just how out of touch this government is with the challenges facing ordinary people. Energy bills are through the roof, national insurance is about to go up and now people will no longer be able to rely on a free test to seethey have an extremely transmissible infection.

Party politics was set aside. Only one item was on the agenda. The House paid its respects and heard the fine words of tribute to Christopher Stalford.One by one his colleagues and rivals stood to deliver the words they did not wish to say. And it was, in a strange way, lovely to hear them say these words and know they meant every one of them.Gone were the tones of bitterness. Gone, too, the cutting cross-party interjections, those with which Christopher Stalford was so prolic during his time in the Assembly.Speaker Alex Maskey opened the Assembly and told of how their backgrounds came from dferent perspectives of le here, but how they had formed a very positive working relationship.But it will be among the ranks of the DUP that Christopher Stalford will be most missed by those who knew him best.As Mr Maskey gave way to DUP deputy leader, Paula Bradley, she stood, wearing black and clutching a handkerchief. You could tell tears were not far away as she began by saying she wished to “honour and give thanks for the le of our much-loved friend and esteemed colleague”.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseAn emotional DUP deputy leader Paula Bradley pays her respects FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueAn emotional DUP deputy leader Paula Bradley pays her respectsShe added: “Words cannot adequately explain the sense of pain and loss that is felt on these benches. Christopher’s joy came not in holding office but in how he could use that office to improve the everyday lives of those he was honoured to represent. It was a mark of the man that he had friends on all sides of this chamber.”Very quickly that became apparent. Across the chamber, Communities Minister Deirdre Hargey led the tributes from Sinn Fein due to the absence of Michelle O’Neill, who’s self-isolating at home due to Covid.She said: “Sadness has fallen upon this chamber. No words can describe the shock, anguish and pain his family is feeling.“I first met Mr Stalford at Belfast City Council and instantly thought he was older than me due to his mannerisms and the attire of his pinstriped suit, initially thinking this was the instructed unorm of all DUP councillors at that time.“He enjoyed the cut and thrust of debate in committees and the debating chamber. While our politics dfered, we shared similarities, growing up in working-class communities in south Belfast.”Mrs O’Neill later tweeted: “I’m struck by the shared sense of loss across the political spectrum. I am reminded that there is far more that unites us than ides us. Rest in peace Christopher.”For almost two-and-half hours, tributes came from all corners of the house, and MLAs also stood respectfully in a minute’s silence.From the SDLP, Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon said: “This is a very sombre day for our Assembly, but particularly for Christopher Stalford’s friends and colleagues in the DUP.“I got to know a man who was challenging, argumentative, ambitious, some may even say combative, during debates, but also a man who was kind, quick-witted, fiercely intelligent and very funny. Christopher Stalford was unique.”Ulster Unionist leader Doug Beattie echoed what many in the Assembly had felt when they heard the tragic news.“My heart sank,” he said.“I have no quick quip to truly outline the person that we all knew, that we all had interactions with. Christopher was unique, absolutely unique. He was a fierce debater. I didn’t just like Christopher Stalford, I was jealous of Christopher Stalford.”There was none of the usual passion from TUV leader Jim Allister, a man rarely lost for words. In fact, they struggled to come today.The tributes continued throughout the session, but perhaps most enlightening was the insight into the person behind the political mask worn in public.The anecdotes from committee rooms and back corridors of power, even the tales of casual conversations between rivals MLAs. Not agreeing about something doesn’t always mean the respect, even the friendship, of those from rival parties doesn’t exist.Alliance leader Naomi Long said: “I did not expect this morning, that I would be standing here paying tribute to him in these circumstances. But it doesn’t surprise me at all that my last conversation with him was about his children and his family, because they were at the heart of everything he did.”Those on the sharpest end of his tongue will miss his presence too.Sinn Fein’s Emma Sheerin added: “You knew that when you met him outside you’d be met with warmth, a bit of craic, good humour, and a genuine friendly comment.”Her party colleague, John O’Dowd, said: “Christopher Stalford was a formidable political opponent. There were times when I debated with Christopher that I tried not to like him afterwards, but I couldn’t. He was such an affable inidual.”The sharp suits, the sharp tongue – it will all be missed at Stormont.But Christopher Stalford, as all those who paid their respects noted, will be even more sorely missed by the family he has left behind.Most ReadSam McBrideOpinionSteeped in politics from his teens, just days ago Christopher Stalford had been given good news...Christopher Stalford’s death: A bright light has gone out in our party and in NI politics, says Sir JeffreyShow at Lyric Theatre cut short after cast complain about behaviour of audienceThe dissident funeral, a UVF gun, and the web of criminality that left four men deadPolitical rivals united in tribute as DUP MLA Christopher Stalforddies suddenlyTop VideosPlayDUP MLA Mervyn Storey leads his party’s Assembly team in a prayer and moment of silence for Christopher StalfordPlayStorm Franklin brings sea foam to Portstewart PlayVideo: Sea wall breached as Storm Franklin hits PortstewartLatest PoliticsVictims’ group criticises Tyrone GAA club over IRA memorialWarm tributes paid across political benches at Stormont to Christopher StalfordMany DUP politicians tear up as NI Assembly hears tributes to late Christopher StalfordPeter WeirOpinionGoodbye Christopher and thanks for everythingSuzanne BreenOpinionBlessed with insight and wit, talking with Christopher was never dullLatestPrime Minister to chair Cobra meeting to discuss Ukraine crisisCrowds of fans gather at London vigil to pay tribute to Jamal EdwardsColombia’s highest court rules to decriminalise abortionWatford boss Roy Hodgson unfazed by cash injection for Crystal Palace successorMajor clear-up as Met Office warns snow on way,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

When it was announced that the new curator would be serving both Newry and Downpatrick this caused great consternation.ldquoWe can understand that frustration and since our local councils were brought together seven years ago where parity should have existed between Newry, Mourne and Down, it has felt that the legacy Down area has been left behind somewhat.ldquoWe have to be straightforward about the facts and Downpatrick is the county town. This carries major signicance. The historical and ecclesiastical heritage of Downpatrick is equally signicant, as is our links to St Patrick. The museum in Downpatrick is the Down County Museum and must be treated as such.The SDLP politicians say while they appreciate the local authorityrsquos need for a curator that serves both Downpatrick and Newry, they are firmly on the view that the curator must be based in Downpatrick.Cllr Enright confirmed that he and Cllr Brown have also been meeting with the Friends of the Museum over the past few weeks and will be calling for a special motion on the restructuring plan to be debated publicly at next monthrsquos full council meeting.ldquoThe council proposal makes no sense whatsoever at all to promote the relatively insignicant Bagelrsquos Castle in Newry over the Down County Museum which is one of the premier professional conservancy and historical centres in Northern Ireland, added Cllr Enright.Cllr Brownrsquos motion calls for a full-time curator to be based at and responsible for the Down County Museum and that the existing curatorial posts of keeper and assistant keeper of collections are permanently filled and not downgraded, with the vital and highly skilled role of the museumrsquos technician photographer also retained and not downgraded.ldquoI am calling for council officers to develop, in consultation with relevant stakeholders, a new, long-term strategic plan for how the council can most effectively invest in museums across the district, he confirmed.ldquoCouncillors are highly concerned by the plans to downgrade staff provision at the Down County Museum and to base the only full-time museum curator in Newry. We are also very concerned about the lack of adequate consultation with key stakeholders, in particular, the Friends of Down County Museum..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Documents of United Irish leader Thomas Russell  shows rich history held  in Down County Museum  ","story":"MANY people in County Down and beyond will be familiar with the words of Florence Mary Wilsonrsquos popular ballad, The Man from God Knows Where, published in  in her best-known collection of poetry, The Coming of the Earls.Her enigmatic subject was Thomas Russell mdash soldier, social reformer and revolutionary mdash who was hanged outside what is now Down County Museum in October .An intimate of Theobald Wolfe Tone, Russell was posted to Belfast as an ensign in the th Regiment of Foot in  and became a founding member of the Society of United Irishmen the following year.Associated with the development of the United Irishmenrsquos insurrectionary strategy in the mid-s, Russell journeyed across Co Down mobilising support for what was expected to be a rebellion supported by French arms. Arrested in Belfast in September , he was a prisoner in Dublin when the Rising raged in  and was despatched along with other State prisoners to Fort George in Scotland the following year.Liberated in , Russell threw himself back into revolutionary politics in support of Robert Emmetrsquos ill-fated coup by attempting to raise once again the standard of rebellion in Co Down. After an anticlimactic call to arms in Loughinisland in July , Russell escaped the county only to be arrested in Dublin and ed to Downpatrick for trial and execution.One of the earliest collections acquired four decades ago by the fledgling Down County Museum was a small parcel of documents relating to the trial of Thomas Russell.The documents include the order from the viceroy, Lord Hardwicke, to initiate proceedings against Russell and the list of jurors who would decide his fate, not that it was ever in doubt. Also contained within the collection is a series of fascinating depositions sworn before local gentry which condemned not only Russell, but two Co Down men, James Corry and James Drake, to execution.The improbability of success for the  Rising is revealed in the deposition of Patrick Doran from Annadorn, who said that ldquonone but fools andmadmen would endorse a Rising so soon after the sobering experience of . Doranrsquos deposition goes on to describe Russellrsquos green Generalrsquos coat, decorated with gold lace and rich epaulettes.Another deposition, from Hugh Magennis, of Ballydugan, provides us with the vivid impression of Russellrsquos ldquomilitary step and appearance, while William Cosby of Saintfield described the mysterious stranger of Wilsonrsquos ballad as a ldquolarge handsome looking man.Such witness statements helped to deliver a guilty verdict and Russell was executed outside the County Gaol, now Down County Museum, on Friday, October , . He was buried in the parish churchyard his gravestone arranged and paid for by the indomitable Mary Ann McCracken of Belfast.These documents held in Down County Museum shed considerable light on an episode of local history that had profound national signicance. Scholars of th century Ireland have visited the museum to consult its rich archive and conferences staged there to discuss the sitersquos deep imprint on Irish history and memory.The size and quality of its collections and the historical importance of its buildings underpin the importance of the internationally-recognised Down County Museum.The ongoing depletion of its highly-qualied and committed staff, which under Newry, Mourne and Down Council proposals now appears to include only a part-time curator, the replacement of the keeper of collections and an assistant with two new positions at a signicantly lower grade, and the removal of the important position of a photographer technician, reflects a disregard for the heritage industry in the county and represents an insult to the hundreds of donors who presented valued family possessions to Down County Museum in the good faith that the Council would preserve, celebrate and cherish them.The fear of many is that the downgrading of the Museum mdash for that is what this is mdash will lead to a reluctance among the public to donate artefacts to the collection and undermine applications for the funding of future projects.The public knows exactly what kind of jewel we have in Down County Museum. One can only hope that a broader awareness of the worrying impact of the Councilrsquos vision will create a clamour whereby the lsquoWrong should cease and the Right prevailrsquo..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Drumaness A and B square off  ","story":"THE ladies of Drumaness B, still buoyant from their win over Strangford B, were unable to repeat another giant killing act against their club-mates, Drumaness A.But in a good glamoured match attended by the league secretary, they can be pleased with their team performance while the result was never in doubt.The title holders conceding  points to the B teammade sure that they got enough points in every game to stay ahead of the have-a-go opposition.Pat Mulholland started the ball rolling with a  pointwinning margin against Philomena Rogan before Charlie Murray added another  points in his match with Katy Rice and Hugh Scott collected a similar winning margin over Norma Gilgunn for an overall score of  points.The ladies were more resolute in the next round of matches and were more content in their performance than points and finished the match with a respectable score overall..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"East Down AC  ","story":"LAST Wednesday some of the East Down AC juniors headed to Mallusk for the Ulster Schoolsrsquo Cross Country Championships.On this occasion they were running in school colours rather than the red and yellow of East Down AC but several of the club coaches were in attendance and watching with interest.The athletes had to qualy for the honour of racing at this level through an inidual top  place or as part of a team that came in the top three at the district qualiers.Although the course was fairly flat and the ground mostly firm underfoot, the long flat stretches were interspersed with a sharp, slippy rises and muddy turns so runners had to choose whether to run wide for safer footing or risk slipping by following the shortest route.The squally showers and very strong gusty winds were an added challenge.Jessica Martinrepresenting Victoria College Belfast over a distance of m came th out of a field of  runners in a time of ..Year Nine girlshad four EDAC runners in the pack Erin Moore, Cara Napier and Charlotte Barr.

A summer festival could focus on this heritage which can be linked with the increase in walking in the Mournes.Cllr Clarke believes there should also be a nautical aspect of a new summer festival, celebrating the rich maritime history of the area.He added: ldquoThere is potential to build on the resortrsquos outdoor water sports or perhaps launch a regional dish competition, opportunities which present the chance to showcase everything is good about Newcastle for visitors and locals alike..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Final four spot for Down High  ","story":"DOWN Highrsquos first XV entertained familiar rivals Omagh Academy in Downpatrick on Saturday morning for their quarter-final tie in the Danske Bank Subsidiary Shield.The two sides met in the opening fixture of the season with Omagh winning - on that occasion.The game didnrsquot get off to an ideal start for Down High when in the first minute, number eight, Rhodri Phillips, made an uncharacteristic error that provided Omagh with a  to cross for an unconverted try in the corner.Within minutes Phillips had made amends when he finished off an excellent Down High multi-phase attack scoring under the posts and leaving himself with a straightforward conversion which he duly slotted over.Omagh, who were playing with the strong wind on their backs in the opening half, applied most of the pressure for the next period of the game and after Joseph Dooley was carded for an accumulation of penalties by the home side, Omagh opted for the posts and added three points to regain the lead.In the th minute, a Down attack that was reminiscent of the one that had led to their opening score, brought play deep into Omagh territory where captain, Cameron McCaughey, showed great footwork and power to e over under the sticks for a try which Phillips easily converted.Omagh were not to leave the first half without reply. With five minutes to go in the half they kicked a penalty to the corner and executed an effective catch and drive line-out to bring the deficit to one point at -.The home support were glad to see the conversion attempt bounce back off the uprights.Down maintained their slender lead into the break when they would turnaround to play with the wind in the second period.Throughout the second half, Down half-backs, Benjamin Hart and Brian Mitchell, managed the wind advantage very effectively to maintain territorial pressure on the County Tyrone school.However, it was the green forwards who capitalised on this pressure scoring all the points that would see the local school comfortably through to the semi-finals.In the th minute second-row, Reuben McKibbin touched down, in the th minute hooker, Fionn Carey got over the line and Ryan Connolly got Downrsquos fth and final try of the day seven minutes from time with Phillips converting two of these tries.With a minute to go in the fixture, Omagh did manage to score a consolatory, unconverted try, although Down Highrsquos controlled attack and physical defence were too strong for a repeat of the early season outcome between the two sides.In other Down High fixtures last week, a hybrid U- U- team came from behind to defeat Clounagh U-s -, while the U-s added to their impressive record this season with four victories over Methodist College, Belfast.The Medallion B XV also defeated Omagh Academyrsquos Medallion team - on Saturday morning in a pre-cursor to the first XV game.

Nineteen other councillors, from the SDLP, Ulster Unionists, DUP and Alliance voted in favour.A lively debate was sparked by the SDLPrsquos Mr John Doris and involved  other councillors.Mr Doris said while he was keen to support the charity which will benefit from the drag hunt the council has money invested in Delamont and he felt it was ldquoinappropriate for the horses and hounds to go across the council track of land.He said the Delamont country park is taking shape very well and it would be ldquovery unwise to allow it to be used in this way.Mr Doris told councillors it would be ldquofoolish even to allow a drag hunt on an experimental basis.He said there is no guarantee that the hunt will stay on the periphery of Delamont.Party colleague, Mr Cathal O Baoill, argued in favour of permitting the hunt. He said the type of person who is a hunting, shooting and fishing man, like something from the Irish RM, is a major tourist attraction. It is a section of the countryside and a major cultural aspect which should be preserved.He pointed out thatthe hunt is successful, it will result in a smelly bag being torn apart.DOWNPATRICK ndash An alternative line has been suggested this week for the poundm Downpatrick town centre by-pass.Down Ulster Unionist councillor, Mr William Biggerstaff, is suggesting that the road could be constructed along part of the route of the former railway line.Mr Biggerstaff believes thatthe line is adopted by the Department of Environment, it will considerably reduce the costs of the provision.ldquoI would envisage incorporating part of the old railway line embankment as the foundation for a new roads system, said Mr Biggerstaff.He expressed concern that the Government-backed regeneration of Downpatrick will be hampered by the failure to resolve the traffic problem.ldquoThere will be no point in regenerating Downpatrickthere isnrsquot road network facility to make use of, she said.ldquoAfter meeting officials of the Department, it is my view that the by-pass will eventually go ahead.

The Eastern Health Board has announced that intends closing Mourne House residential home for the elderly, despite a strong protest lobby.A spokesman for the Southern Board said last weekrsquos vote was ldquototally unanimous and followed preliminary discussions with staff and patientsrsquo relatives.The two-storey building, which was built in the rsquos, was turned into a holiday home for the mentally handicapped in . At one stage it provided holiday accommodation for  patients.With the Board running down its holiday operations at Navan House in recent years, it is now being used as an extension of the Boardrsquos mental health hospital in Armagh and contains  patients.The spokesman said the decision to close is in line with Board policy aimed at ing people to the community.ldquoNavan House costs around pound, a year to run. The Board believes this money could be better spent developing community services, he continued.The spokesman said a final decision will only be taken following consultations with patients, staff, local councillors and community groups.ldquoThere is a general recognition that we should have fewer long-stay patients in mental hospitals. There is no need to retain a facility which is  miles away from the main hospital in Armagh, the spokesman added.CROSSGAR ndash SDLP MP, Mr Eddie McGrady, has reported success in his campaign to have the mains water system in the Crossgar Killyleagh area improved.The South Down MP pointed out that after serious supply problems just before Christmas  he took the meter up with the Minister, Mr Richard Needham.ldquoI am now pleased that the Department having considered a study is designing a scheme to lay a waterman from Raleigh to New Line, Crossgar, which will increase the reliability of the supply to the Killyleagh and Shirley areas. This work should commence later this year, said Mr McGrady.ldquoThis study also identied the need to replace two watermains in Killyleagh. One of these on the Downpatrick Roa has already been replaced and work to replace the other at Kerry Drive should be completed by the end of this month.ldquoThis is indeed welcome news and hopefully the new waterman will enhance the standard of supply in these areas, added Mr McGrady.SAINTFIELD ndash A lamb processing plant providing up to  jobs is being planned for Mid Down.A facility handling , lamb carcasses a year could be up and running within twelve months, it was announced this week.A number of green-field sites in the Saintfield, Crossgar and Ballygowan areas are being considered, with construction work could begin in August.The main behind the scheme is Mr Alex Waugh, a director of the Newtownards-based company, Milltown Livestock and Meats.A separate company led by Mr Waugh is currently involved in discussions with the Industrial Development Board, the Department of Agriculture, the Planning Service and other government agencies.ldquoThere are a lot of hurdles to cross, but I am confident the factory will be built. Initially, we would hope to employ  people, rising to around  with two years, Mr Waugh said.ldquoThis will be an ultra-modern processing plant in the provincersquos main sheep producing area. I have spoken to many farmers and I am encouraged by their remarks, he continued.ldquoWe do not have a sheep processing plant in Northern Ireland and only three abbatoirs have slaughtering facilities for sheep. At present, less than half of our lambs are processed in the province.Mr Waugh said the plant will provide an opportunity for the sheep industry to gain a larger shore of the important British and European markets.Mr Waugh added: ldquoWe are progressing as quickly as possible and hope to get started by August or September.

Picture by Brian LittleI first met him at Stormont in the late s, when he was still at school, and a frequent visitor to Stormont with his friend and constituency predecessor Mark Robinson MLA.As a student he was a bit of a political geek, with a depth of knowledge and analysis of local, national and international politics that belied his youth, equally at home discussing the latest developments in Washington or Westminster, as he was with Sandy Row or Stormont . As with many of us who were involved in politics from a young age, he initially came across as a bit square and we often joked that he started off middle aged and became younger with age.He came from a close and loving family, but was not born with a silver spoon in his mouth, and achieved his many successes through hard work and ability. Indeed, from early meetings his intelligence, talent and potential shone through, which was why as soon as I joined the DUP in , I headhunted him to work for me, first as a student, and then after graduation, becoming his first employer.    \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

High Sherf, Deputy Mayor and MLA filled me with pride but given his abilities no little surprise. When he became Principal Deputy Speaker he was filled with joy, not least because he knew the pleasure it would give his much loved family.Christopher was someone who cared about his city and his community. Although he moved house several times, it was always within Belfast itself. He was passionately committed to delivering for his constituents, and was a fearsome debater, who could deliver an argument with clarity, passion and wit. He was a true Unionist and Orangeman through and through, andyou had cut him in two he would have had DUP written through him like a stick of rock.He was not however a two dimensional political ideologue. Although he never swayed in his unionist convictions, his friendships and courtesy cut across the political spectrum. Indeed one of his sparring partners from Queens, Mary Durkan who became an SDLP Councillor in Londonderry, would be sure to ask me any time I met her “How is Stalfie doing ” The breadth of tributes paid to Christopher is a measure of the respect he engendered throughout the political world and beyond.Christopher was a Bon viveur and good company, a man with a wide hinterland of interests, and hidden depths as anyone who has heard him perform Sinatra in karaoke can testy. He was also a man of quiet, untrumpeted kindness. When my mother died a few months ago, knowing that I would be alone, he insisted that I spend Christmas Day with him and his family, That was the Christopher that lay behind the public image.Above all he was a devoted family man, who glowed with love and pride for his beloved we Laura and their four children. The country has lost a great representative, I have lost a great friend, but it is the loss of a husband, father, son and brother that will be most keenly felt and cruelly missed.

He just loved politics and engagement with the public and he was an excellent barometer of where public opinion within unionism rested.”He said a “shadow of loss” hangs over the party.Mr Paisley added: “He rose very quickly through the ranks of the party achieving electoral success and ultimately making the South Belfast assembly seat his own. He was cut out for the deputy speaker role and would have no doubt climbed to higher office.“I last spoke to Chris in the middle of the past week after his appearance on the media.

He said: “I’m sure you meant well, but that last line is, at best, misjudged, and at worst, is offensive to his family who would rather he was with them.”But Alliance leader Naomi Long lept to her defence.“Please, stop attacking Carl Lockhart over her tweet, today of all days,” she tweeted. “She is grieving.” Ms Long noted Carla was quoting Philippians v “about the faithful being torn between service in this le and being with Christ in eternity”. She added: “It’s a very common Christian quote, which his family will understand.” Her tweet attracted over  likes.Similarly, SDLP leader Colum Eastwood branded the criticism as “disgusting”, adding that it “shows how this  can be so poisonous”. He added: “Many people seem to converse in a way that they would never dream of doing in person. I just don’t get it. Solidarity with Carla Lockhart.”Ms Lockhart told the News Letter that she stands by her comment. “Christopher’s faith, shared by Laura, his beloved we, offers that promise of eternal le in glory when the Lord calls us home,” she said.“That time is not of our choosing - Christopher’s love and zest for le, and most of all his love for his family - would have meant he no doubt would have loved to have lived a long le. But we know that was not God’s plan.“For the family - in the depths of such sorrow - there is great comfort in that surety that Christopher is in his heavenly home. The surety of our eternal home however does not remove the sadness for those left behind.”Another tweeter, Fred Crawford, also came to her defence. He said: “The comments underneath show the widespread illiteracy regarding Christianity in our society. All Christians believe that to be with Christ is far better, that is the hope of the faith and why we believe what we do. This view should be respected right now.”A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

They say that the beach is a sand and shingle beach and has a reputation for being one of the cleanest in the region. There is a coastal walk, chance to go fishing, surfing and views of Tusker Rock.For those owners who may not yet have ventured to the beach with their pups or are concerned about behaviour while at the beach, Wood Green’s dog behaviour and training specialist, Wendy Kruger, has provided some tips to prepare your dog for the beach.• Ensure your dog’s microchip and collar tag details are up to date – just in case.• Get used to checking ground surface temperatures before you take your dog out, as dry sand can be too hot for dogs’ paws on sunny days. To check the ground temperature, place the back of your hand on the ground. If its too hot to hold comfortably for five seconds, it’s too hot for dogs’ paws..remove• Practise basic, reward-based training when out and about to help your dog to maintain focus and engagement on walks.• Recall is also an area that needs particular attention. Evenyour dog has a great recall at home, its not something that can be guaranteed in unfamiliar environments with exciting new distractions. Games with toys are a fantastic way to help your dog engage with you when there are other distractions around. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Subject to Parliamentary approval, the Government is axing the legal obligation to isolate after a positive test from February .However, the official public health advice will remain that people testing positive for the virus should stay at home for five days. This includes both adults and children.Crucially, this guidance will not be enforced by law.The Government will also no longer ask vaccinated contacts, and those under , to test for seven days, and will remove the legal requirement for contacts who are not vaccinated to self-isolate.Meanwhile, there will be an end to routine contact tracing. vw,vw,px, px\"Free universal coronavirus testing will end for the general public in England from April  – Can I still get free Covid tests For now, yes. But this is changing at the beginning of April.Mr Johnson hinted on Sunday that provision for free tests could not continue at their current rate due to the cost of £ billion a month.We now know that free universal symptomatic and asymptomatic testing will end for the general public in England from April .Remaining symptomatic testing will be focused on the most vulnerable, with the UK Health Security Agencyset to determine the details.This is expected to include people over the age of  and the immunosuppressed.A degree of asymptomatic testing will also be maintained in the most risky settings, such as in social care.Mr Johnson’s administration has been warned by critics that the public could be left “flying blind” on Covidleft without free testing provision..removeThe UKHSA will maintain an appropriate level of lab infrastructure to be able to dial back up PCR testing, should this be needed.It will also maintain a stockpile of LFTs for a surge in usagerequired.Covid- has not gone away, but because of the efforts we have made as a country over the past two years we can now move from government regulations to personal responsibility.Read our plan for living with Covid ⬇️— UK Prime MinisterFebruary , – So how much will I have to pay for tests The Government expects a market for lateral flow devices to develop once boxes are no longer available free on the NHS, with inidual tests expected to cost a few pounds.To prevent people stockpiling them before April , iniduals will only be able to order a box of tests on the NHS every three days instead of every  hours.– What is happening with support payments From February , the Government is planning to end self-isolation payments and some of the practical support that accompanies them.Currently, people in England on low incomes can claim £ in financial supportthey are forced to isolate after testing positive for Covid or coming into contact with someone who has. This provision will come to an end on Thursday.Next month, from March , the Government is intending to reverse changes to statutory sick payand employment support allowance designed to help people through the Covid crisis.– Will I be asked to get another vaccine ➡️ https:t.co GZbFAiKnN pic dVEOgsgh— UK Prime MinisterFebruary , People aged  and over, the immunosuppressed and those living in care homes will be offered another Covid- booster vaccine this spring.Health Secretary Sajid Javid said on Monday that the top-up jab will help those at the highest risk of serious illness maintain a high level of protection against the virus.The NHS in England will offer people the jab from around six months after their last dose, with further details due to be set out shortly.In interim guidance published for planning purposes, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisationsaid a further dose for older people and those at risk is likely to be needed this autumn.This is because, although vaccines offer strong protection, their effectiveness does wane over time and Covid surges are expected in winter.The autumn jab campaign is expected to cover a wider group of people than in the spring and could include any new Covid vaccines that are available.– What about the devolved nations — Nicola SturgeonFebruary , Mr Johnson’s plan applies only to England, but that does not mean it will not affect Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland in any way.One major development is the end to free universal testing in April, which will prove controversial with devolved leaders.Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford said prior to Monday’s announcement that it would be “premature and reckless” to wind back the programme, adding: “Testing has played a pivotal role in breaking chains of transmission and as a surveillance tool helping us detect and respond to emerging iants. It’s essential that this continues.”And Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said “signicant dismantling” of the testing regime would be “inexcusable negligence given ongoing risks”.However it became clear on Monday that the devolved nations will need to cover the cost of universal free testing beyond April  themselves, should they think it necessary.Ms Sturgeon is expected to set out her new strategic framework for dealing with coronavirus on Tuesday. vw,vw,px, px\"Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon is expected to set out her new strategic framework for dealing with coronavirus on Tuesday She has said it would be “unacceptable” for public health decisions of the devolved administrations to be impacted by funding choices taken by the UK Government.There are currently no formal plans to end the self-isolation rules in Wales, which mean people with Covid have to remain at home for five full days anda negative lateral flow test on days five and six.However Welsh economy minister Vaughan Gething has said it is possible all Covid restrictions in the country could be lted by the end of March.Northern Ireland’s health minister Robin Swann said on Monday that his department would “carefully consider” the “living with Covid” plan unveiled in England.But he said no decisions had been taken on any changes to the country’s test and trace programme.People in Northern Ireland are still advised to self-isolatethey test positive for the virus, or they have been in contact with a positive case and are not vaccinated – although this is not legally-enforced. vw,vw,px, px\"Northern Ireland’s health minister Robin Swann – Does “living with Covid” mean it’s all over Sadly not. Mr Johnson said at a Downing Street press conference on Monday evening that “we should be clear that the pandemic is not over”, warning “there may be signicant resurgences”.Meanwhile, Sir Patrick Vallance, the Government’s chief scientic adviser, said Covid will continue to evolve over the next couple of years, and there is no guarantee that future iants will be less severe.He said it is essential to maintain a virus surveillance system, the capacity to “ramp up” measures again quickly and to protect the vulnerable.“This pandemic is not over. The virus is continuing to evolve. It will continue to do so quite fast probably for the next couple of years,” he said.“There is no guarantee that the next iant is as reduced severity as Omicron.“The change in severity is a random by-product.

Women are more likely to ditch their partner than their pet, found a poll for nationwide pet retailer Jollyes. Asked about their relationship with their partner and their pet and which one they would ditch first,  per cent said they would ditch their partner against  per cent who would ditch their pet. Men were more loyal to their partners, with  per cent saying they would ditch their pet and  per cent saying they would ditch their partner. Overall,  per cent would ditch their partner first and  per cent said the pet would go first. The study was carried out by Jollyes to gauge humans’ attitudes to romance and relationships as it launches the search on social media for a canine couple to take part in a romantic dinner for two at its doggy dates diner, “C’est Jollyes”, open for one day only on  February at its Runcorn store in Cheshire . Two dogs will get the chance to enjoy a three course dinner featuring a menu from Jollyes Artisan Lestage range including angus beef with sweet potato, venison and salmon, and duck with sweet potato. The survey showed some big dferences in attitudes to pets and partners around the UK. People in North East England were more likely to ditch their partnerover their pet, followed by London , Northern Ireland , South West . [See table in editor’s notes below for regional breakdown.] Owners were asked what they loved most about their pets, with loyalty, unconditional love, loving nature, affection and a warm heart among the qualities cited. No matter how much love an animal gives, most pet ownerswould prefer a romantic Valentine’s night with their partner than one spent with their pet. Of male respondents,  per cent chose a night with their partner, compared with  per cent of female respondents. The figures were broadly similar across the country. Among the other popular traits cited by pet owners were: “they are so loyal and loving. And cute!” “unconditional love and loyalty” “they comfort me when I’m feeling blue” “doesnt argue or answer back” “they always cheer me up” “waggy tail and warm heart” and “her loving nature, always there for me when I need her”. One said: “Sometimes playful, sometimes cuddly, intelligent, independent, sometimes dangerous. All rather like my partner really.” Not everyone was totally enamoured with their pet. One said: “Nothing, it hates me, only loves my we”. And not all pets’ traits would make for a romantic night out – one said: “hassle free”, another said “doesn’t answer back” and one said “it’s a tortoise and he’s as indferent to use as we are to him”. Phil Turner-Naylor, head of marketing at Jollyes, said: “We’re known as a nation of animal lovers and this goes to prove it. When it comes to relationships, a lot people would choose their pet over their partner. “The good news for romantics though is that a big majority choose people over pets. What it does show, especially for men, is that partners have to work hard to keep the romance going or they might find themselves in the dog house. Women are looking for a romantic night with their partner on Valentine’s, butthe men don’t get it right, they had better watch out.”  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_cfadbcdbba   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_defcebaddbaf   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1645089617694.jpg--1_700_people_apply_for_a_life_less_ordinary_with_stena_line.jpg?164508961700","title":"  people apply for a life less ordinary with stena line ","story":"Ferry company Stena Line has been overwhelmed with the positive response from the public to its recent recruitment campaign ‘A Le Less Ordinary’, which aims to fill  vacant positions onboard its Irish Sea ferries. , applications were received from people across the UK and Republic of Ireland. The campaign promoted the unique nature of le onboard, with % time-off providing the perfect work-le balance for people wanting to live and work onboard for either a one or two-week sht and then spend equal time off. The positions available are part of the Onboard Sales and Servicesteam, with vacancies for service assistants and chefs. With January being the traditional time of the year when many people look for a new career, Stena Line had hoped for a favourable response but even the most optimistic of predictions could not have expected it to be so over-subscribed. Stena Line has now undertaken the initial stage of the selection process and, for the first-time, is hosting two Open Days for prospective candidates on Monday th February, where they will get a chance to meet members of Stena Line’s crews. The Open Days are taking place in Belfast and Birkenhead with the latter being held onboard one of Stena Line’s newest ferries, Stena Edda, giving candidates a chance to get a first-hand taste of le onboard on the Irish Sea. Stephen Bryden, Stena Line’s Head of Onboard Sales and Services, commented on the success of the campaign: “I am astonished by the public’s response to the A Le Less Ordinary recruitment campaign. We have never received so many applications. It really goes to show how many people are attracted to a le at sea with a company like Stena Line. Now our HR team has the challenge of how to sort and interview so many applicants, but that is a nice challenge to have. Thank you to every single person that has applied to work with us.”  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_cfadbcdbba   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_defcebaddbaf   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1564499438658.jpg--agri_food_leaders_call_on_stormont_to_follow_the_science_on_climate_change_legislation.jpg?156449943800","title":"agri food leaders call on stormont to follow the science on climate change legislation ","story":"Industry leaders within the agri-food supply chain have said thatpassed unchanged, the Executive Climate Change Bill would have devastating consequences, including job losses, for the Northern Ireland economy. The damage done to local food production will require a reliance on food imports that would exacerbate global emissions and increase prices for the consumer. The impact would be particularly felt in rural towns and communities who depend on the sector for their livelihoods. They are calling on Assembly MLAs to recty the Bill by making meaningful amendments that are in line with the scientic evidence and that support their local communities who rely on the sector for their livelihoods. The organisations behind this warning are the Dairy Council for Northern Ireland the Northern Ireland Food  Drink AssociationNorthern Ireland Grain Trade Association , Northern Ireland Meat Exporters Association , the Livestock and Meat Commission , the Ulster Farmers Union . Speaking on behalf of this supply chain alliance, Conall Donnelly, Chief Executive of NIMEA said: “To be very clear, our collective members are in support of Climate Change legislation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. We want to play our part. We are already investing in and implementing carbon-reducing technologies right across our supply chain and will continue to do so. Because of our natural grass advantage, we already have a world-class reputation for sustainable food production. Our high-quality beef, lamb and dairy produce is reared with care on small family farms utilising natural grass and is the envy of many countries around the world. We believe Northern Ireland has the potential to be a shining light in sustainable food production. We want to work with policy makers to get this right for the environment and the local economy. That means having realistic and science-based climate change targets relevant to Northern Ireland so that we can continue to be part of the solution to climate change.” David Brown, Deputy President of the UFU said, “ passed without further amendments, this legislation would not follow the expert advice from scientists that make up the International Panel of Climate Change and the UK’s Climate Change Committee. It could unnecessarily obliterate tens of thousands of jobs as well as threaten consumer access to affordable, quality food. Perversely, food may need to be imported from where which would simply increase global emissions. “This Bill also has the potential to damage rural towns and communities who depend on our sector for their livelihoods. But it will affect us all as consumers when we are no longer able to access local fresh food that is produced to high environmental and animal welfare standards. We are asking politicians to work with us. We want to tackle climate change in a way that helps protect the environment and maintains the unique economic and social role that agriculture and food production has on this island.”  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_acdbdeecddf   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_dfcafdbfca   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1645454612923.jpg--covid_19___mon_21st_february_figures.jpg?164545461200","title":"covid  mon st february figures ","story":"The NI Department of Health dashboard shows four further coronavirus related death and , new positive test results.
