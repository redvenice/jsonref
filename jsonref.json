Photograph: iStockPupils could start learning foreign languages as early as third class under sweeping changes being proposed for the primary curriculum.The planned shake-up in teaching and learning in primary schools – the most dramatic in 20 years – could also see a reduction in time allocated to religious faith formation and other subjects.Instead, there will be a strong emphasis on wellbeing, maths and languages, along with new aspects such as technology.Schools would also be given more “flexible time” to decide on what areas of learning they want to prioritise for their pupils.The proposals are contained in a draft primary curriculum framework which is the subject of new consultation process, overseen by National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA).A previous consultation with schools was postponed in late 2020 due to the pandemic.Parents, teachers, school leaders and children are being invited to share their observations online from todayMonday until February 2022.This draft framework will guide the development of a new curriculum which will shape how children learn over the coming decades.The NCCA envisages the completion of the development of all curriculum area specifications by summer 2026.The speed of the rollout of the changes will be a matter for the then minister for education.It is expected that among the first children to be taught under the new curriculum will be born from this year onwards.Underlining the need to keep the curriculum up to date, the NCCA pointed out that these children will begin their working lives in the 2050s and are due retire in the late 2080searly 2090s.Some of the proposals contained in the draft framework would see major changes such as:The NCCA says the changes build on the strengths of the 1999 primary school curriculum, while responding to challenges, changing needs and priorities.It says the changes aim to give increased agency and flexibility to schools in their role as “curriculum-makers”.It would also, say officials, promote stronger connections between children’s experiences in primary and their prior experiences in pre-school, and with their later experiences in post-primary school.The proposed changes are based on an extensive body of research and curriculum consultations.They also draw on work which has taken place in a schools forum, which included dozens of primary, pre-schools and post-primary schools, along with deliberations with education partners and wider stakeholders."},{"url":null,"title":"full return to offices delayed until next spring says varadkar","story":"The full return to offices is being delayed until next spring in response to rising Covid-19 casesThe full return to offices is being delayed until next spring in response to rising Covid-19 cases, Tánaiste Leo Varadkar has said.Setting out changes to the Government’s planned lifting of coronavirus restrictions, Mr Varadkar said “a staggered and phased return to the office” was still possible but a full return to offices – “as we knew them”– would not happen until the spring of 2022.Under the previous reopening plan announced at the end of August, the Government planned to remove the requirement to work from home from October 22nd permitting workers to return to workplaces where they had worked from home on a phased and cautious basis.The National Public Health Emergency Team advised the Government that the return to the workplace should continue on a “phased and cautious basis” but recommended that “all who can work from home should continue to do so”.“A staggered and phased return to the office is possible so people going back to the office for a specific business purpose lik e ameeting or training, for example, or inductions, that is allowed,” said Mr Varadkar.“Certainly people who can work from home and want to continue to work from home, their employer should facilitate that.’The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment said there had been people “working from home with a laptop on a bed for 18 months now” and that they really wanted to return to the office.“If that can be facilitated, if they can be in an office on their own or in an office where they are socially distanced from other people, that should be facilitated too,” he said.Mr Varadkar said the Government would be meeting trade unions and employer groups on Tuesday to update work safety protocols over the coming days.Nphet cautioned in its letter to Government that public health restrictions may have to be reintroduced if the newly recommended measures did not suppress the spread of the virus. The health team stressed the importance of employers encouraging workers to self-isolate if they are showing symptoms of Covid-19 and said employees should not be disincentivised by employers if they identify themselves as symptomatic and have to stay at home.Home-working had played “a very important role” in containing the spread of Covid-19 throughout the pandemic, Nphet said.It said there were 19 workplace Covid-19 outbreaks reported in the latest weekly figures, including five in food or meat production facilities and four in the construction sector.

Photograph: Aidan CrawleyA revised reopening plan has been unveiled by Ministers which will see the easing of further restrictions on the night-time economy coupled with the retention of public health measures until at least February 2022.Under the plan, normal trading hours in pubs, restaurants and wider hospitality will resume, and nightclubs are set to reopen from Friday – albeit it with restrictions – for the first time since the start of the pandemic.New rules will be developed for the operation of nightclubs which are likely to “involve Covid-19 passes, contact tracing data collection and wearing of face masks except when eating, drinking and dancing”, the Government said in a statement.Religious services and weddings will now be allowed to proceed without any limits on capacity, while the return to workplaces will continue on a “phased and cautious” basis.Speaking to reporters after the plan was announced Tánaiste Leo Varadkar admitted the country was not where it hoped to be with regards to coronavirus infections.He said two or three weeks ago the trajectory of Covid cases had taken a turn for the worse with rising case numbers, hospitalisations and intensive care (ICU) numbers.Mr Varadkar also warned the country was not past the peak of this Delta wave: “Indeed, we are most likely experiencing a twin peak.”Mr Varadkar said: “The pandemic isn’t over yet. We’re going to have get through at least another winter before we can say it’s behind us.”He told reporters at a post-Cabinet briefing: “We’re not where we hoped to be or expected to be for October 22nd.” He said the National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) expected Covid-19 cases to peak at the end of October, with ICU numbers peaking at about 150 by the end of November.Taoiseach Micheál Martin said a booster vaccine programme for people aged 60 and over would begin “immediately”, following a recommendation from the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac).“Over the course of the last two weeks we have seen a worsening of the Covid situation,” Mr Martin added. “These figures are a cause of concern and a timely reminder of how dangerous this virus is.”The Government had hoped to fully lift the vast majority of Covid-19 restrictions from October 22nd but the recent surge in cases has seen these plans amended. Instead, many restrictions will remain in place.A Covid-19 vaccine certificate will still be required for indoor hospitality and events, while the use of face masks and social distancing will remain in place until 2022.“Government has made its decision in relation to Nphet advice,” Mr Martin said.The Government has also agreed to an enhanced role for antigen testing. Mr Martin said the State’s rapid testing expert advisory group will provide a recommendation on the use of voluntary self-testing by asymptomatic iniduals who plan to attend risky activities, such as nightclubs.Antigen tests will also be used for fully vaccinated people who are close contacts and have no symptoms.Mr Martin added: “The progress we have made together is real and it has to be protected. The changes we have made gives us the space to make sure that the next step we take is safe.“If you are indoors with other people, wear a mask. If you are running a business that is bringing people indoors, check for vaccination certs. If you have not been vaccinated or had a second vaccination, please make arrangement to get fully vaccinated. It is safe and it is free.”‘Live with Covid’Mr Varadkar also told reporters that Nphet had considered recommending a full pause of the easing of Covid-19 restrictions but had ultimately recommended against such a course of action because the Covid-19 situation would not change in the next number of weeks“We are going to have to live with Covid. It won’t be easy,” Mr Varadkar said.During their meeting Ministers considered the latest recommendations from Nphet, which said restrictions such as mask wearing and social distancing must remain in place until February 2022.In a letter to Ministers, the chief medical officer, Tony Holohan, warned the epidemiological situation in Ireland had deteriorated and was now uncertain and precarious.The latest estimates show there are about 370,000 people who have yet to be vaccinated or fully vaccinated against Covid and these people will not be able to avail of indoor hospitality.The Government has also decided that the current enhanced illness benefit payment arrangements for Covid-19 will remain in place. This benefit is available at a rate of €350 a week, with no waiting days, for employees and self-employed people who are certified by a registered medical practitioner as diagnosed with Covid-19 or a probable source of infection of Covid-19.With regards to international travel, intending passengers will continue to require evidence of a valid PCR test result, unless exempt (such as vaccinated or recovered or children under 12), while airlines continue to be required to check PCR test results and to deny boarding to passengers who do not have acceptable documentation.It is understood Niac recommended a dose of the Pfizer vaccine for those aged between 60 and 79 who have been vaccinated. The booster shot will be given at least five months after the previous dose.There were 1,578 new cases of Covid-19 reported on Monday with 484 in hospital, up 25, and 73 in ICU. The five-day moving average of cases was 1,736, according to a statement from Nphet.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"mcd faces claims of abrasive management behaviour","story":"Concert promoter MCD runs the music festival Electric Picnic.

Photograph: Nick BradshawPlans to sell the former Chivers jam factory in north Dublin for €25 million have “left a very sour taste” in the mouths of Dublin city councillors who said they felt “fooled” into rezoning the land for housing.Councillors are disputing the validity of the zoning saying “sugared” promises of homes had encouraged them to rezone the land, leading to a 10-fold increase in its value.In 2017, the site’s owner, Andrew Gillick, asked councillors to rezone the old jam factory in Coolock for housing. He said he and his brother Maurice intended to build about 350 apartments up to five storeys in height. The factory site, which had been vacant for almost 20 years, had been valued at €2.55 million the previous year .Independent councillor John Lyons said the site should be dezoned. “We made a zoning decision based on the information supplied to us by the owners of that site which it turns out was untrue,” he said. “They were very clear and explicit, they were going to develop that site to provide, as they said, affordable housing for normal and needy people… and they have completely reneged on that.”‘Serious implications’Sinn Féin councillor Mícheál Mac Donncha said there were “serious implications” for any future rezonings. “This was presented to us in a very sugared way as a great social enterprise and now we see the reality, that the intention it seems all along was to flip the site.”His party colleague Larry O’Toole said the council had been “fooled” into a rezoning decision. “These two geezers breezed in here with nothing in their minds but to line their pockets.” Fianna Fáil councillor Tom Brabazon said the episode had “left a very sour taste in our mouths”.Lord Mayor Alison Gilliland said Mr Gillick recently told her he did not have the €150 million required to build the project and no finance was available in Ireland. When contacted by The , Mr Gillick said he “did not mislead anyone” and the project represented “a great result all round”. “We are not builders, we are property developers, and we have given a tremendous amount to the city and community,” he said. “We did a phenomenal job and achieved a great planning permission.” Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"City with echoes of San Francisco is thrillingly original, yet tarnished by graft and neglectGrowing energy, security and diplomatic links between Moscow and Beijing worry WestDecembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaintsMoscow Letter: Poet\u0026rsquos statue has been a magnet for generations of Russian dissentersOn the eve of an expected sham election, many of Putin\u0026rsquos political opponents are already jailed or dead"},{"url":null,"title":"boris cant afford complacent booster jabs","story":"One of our household’s resident teenagers was diagnosed with Covid recently, and it was an oddly irritating experience.As a late middle aged adult, I was always cautiously aware that in the event I contracted the virus, I would be at risk of hospitalisation or worse. Perhaps the regular and copious doses of vitamin D supplements which my wife has insisted on for years had helped improve my immune system, but there is no doubt that people of my age and physical shape are particularly vulnerable to Covid’s worst effects.Teenagers? Not so much, apparently. There have certainly been a few tragic cases of otherwise healthy younger people falling dreadfully ill and even dying as a result of infection. But for the great majority of them – our 15-year-old son, for example – the plus side of Covid, in the form of at least ten days off school, outweighs the negative side, which in our son’s case included a temporary loss of taste and smell, a bit of a cough and no obvious decline in his appetite.Not that I would have wanted the boy to suffer unduly, but his robust response to a virus that has brought most of the world to a standstill in the last two years was an uncomfortable reminder of the different scale of threat it poses to people of different age groups. Which brings us to the logistical and political problems surrounding the rollout of booster doses of Covid vaccine to the most vulnerable – ie, the elderly – while at the same time seeking to offer first doses to teenagers.The figures for the booster rollout are not encouraging. Essentially, if the booster vaccination rate continues to fall behind the rate at which citizens, through the process of ageing, fall into the most vulnerable groups, then the backlog grows and the target of full protection drifts further away. As the  reports today, at the peak of England\u0027s vaccine rollout, more than 500,000 doses were being given a day – but just 99,000 booster shots were reported in England on Monday, and the current daily average for other jabs has fallen to around 50,000.The fear is that Boris\u0027 administration, which has so far managed to avoid the direct blame for the pandemic and has consequently maintained a healthy polling advantage over its rivals, is displaying dangerous signs of complacency now that voters’ attention is at last being drawn to other issues.Such fears may be slightly overblown. This week’s booster numbers were indeed low, but last week the daily average was 181,405, which is about the same as the vaccination rate in early January. The danger is that nine months ago, the Government turbo-charged the rollout programme a similar boost is needed now to ensure a similar rate of effectiveness among the most vulnerable groups.Less generous observers might conclude that the Government is unable to chew gum and walk at the same time: a nationwide programme to inject 12-15-year-olds is happening simultaneously to the booster programme, with the former happening even more slowly than the latter. So dissatisfying is progress in vaccinating teenagers, in fact, that the Government is considering taking a leaf out of the Scottish government’s book and allowing teenagers to use walk-in centres without the need of a formal appointment.According to the Office of National Statistics, in the week ending October 9, the percentage of those testing positive for Covid-19 was highest – by a country mile – among school pupils. This presents a dilemma for ministers, given that this is the group that is least likely to suffer serious effects from the illness, but which still needs to be vaccinated, even as resources for the various rollouts risk letting down those citizens – the elderly, care home staff, frontline health workers and the physically vulnerable – who should be in line for booster jabs.The evidence suggests that the protection offered by the various vaccines does indeed wane with time, so the effectiveness of the latest rollout is vital, not just for the obvious health reasons, but for the Government to hold onto the political benefits of having been among the first to approve the vaccine in the first place.The Prime Minister has enjoyed the benefit of the doubt throughout this pandemic on the basis that no one (other than remote foreign players) can be blamed for it. That patience is at risk if even the perception, let alone the reality, of complacency is allowed to creep into the booster programme.More from NewsPolitics latest news: Britain will be \u0026#39Qatar of hydrogen\u0026#39, Boris Johnson says as No 10 publishes net zero strategyDuchess of Cambridge: Addiction is not a choice and none of us are immunePlans to curb power of European Court of Human Rights could jeopardise Brexit trade dealServing GMP officer charged with 11 child sexual abuse offencesQueen turns down Oldie award saying ‘you are only as old as you feel’Dennis Hutchings\u0026#39 lawyers say former soldier was \u0026#39thrown to the wolves\u0026#39More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"dennis hutchings interview not just about clearing name trials","story":"Dennis Hutchings walks 20 yards out of the cafe on the Plymouth seafront and stops abruptly, unable to breathe. He gulps for air, his body in contortions. Mr Hutchings, 80 and a great grandfather, is suffering from heart failure and has fluid on the lungs. On Saturday Oct 2 he will travel to hospital for kidney dialysis - three times a week his blood is cleaned and filtered - and then on Sunday he will drive to Bristol airport and take a flight to Belfast. The next day - this Monday - Mr Hutchings, a former staff sergeant in the Life Guards regiment, will go on trial for the attempted murder of a young man, shot and killed in County Tyrone, more than 47 years ago.The trial - six years after Mr Hutchings was first arrested - is deeply embarrassing for Boris Johnson, who had promised to end the prosecution of Northern Ireland veterans.Instead, in the middle of the Conservative Party conference, a dying soldier will stand in the dock over events that took place almost half a century ago.His doctors have advised Mr Hutchings not to travel and were prepared to provide him with a medical certificate that would have caused the trial to be postponed indefinitely. Instead, Mr Hutchings will walk into the court in Laganside in Belfast on Monday with his head held high, defiant and medals pinned to his chest. He wanted to wear his uniform too but he has been told not to by both police and the Ministry of Defence.“I will wear my medals in court. I was going to wear my uniform but I have been advised against it. The security people in Northern Ireland, police and officials in the Ministry of Defence advised me against it. They said it would cause too many problems,” said Mr Hutchings. The last six years of his life have been wrecked by the investigation into the death of John Patrick Cunningham, a 27-year-old man with learning difficulties, shot in the back as he ran across a field on June 15, 1974. Another soldier - known only as Soldier B and who has since died - is thought to have fired the fatal shots. No ballistics evidence exists. Mr Hutchings said: “My consultant gives me six months to live. The kidney problems have got more serious and I have heart failure as well. My consultant says six months if I’m lucky. He could have signed me off sick but I am going to court. I could have got out of this trial but I don’t want to.Mr Hutchings points out Northern Ireland back then was a war zone. He dismisses the gentler term The Troubles.“It was no such thing. It was a conflict. In places it was a war. More servicemen were killed in Northern Ireland than in Iraq and Afghanistan combined but that hardly gets mentioned.”The trial, in front of a judge only, is listed for six weeks with proceedings halted every two days so that Mr Hutchings can undergo dialysis at an undisclosed Northern Ireland hospital. His hands and arms are black and blue, bruised from constant treatment and the prodding of needles. He spent 26 years in the Army, signing up at the age of 18 in October 1959, after three and half years working down the mines in Blyth in Northumberland. He had wanted to join the Navy but couldn’t find the recruiting office in Newcastle and was signed up instead by the Army.“I wouldn’t do anything differently again,” he said, reflecting on his predicament. And that includes the day of the fateful shooting. He is insistent he shot high over John Patrick Cunningham’s head, purely in an attempt to get him to stop. The shots he fired, he said, were “all in the air”, adding: “I had to aim in the air,” pointing out that his men were converging on the field and there was a great danger of one of them being killed in any crossfire. As Cunningham lay dying, Mr Hutchings tried to save the young man’s life, applying a field dressing to the wounds. At this point, Soldier B told him he had fired the fatal shot.Mr Hutchings was investigated at the time and subsequently cleared of all wrongdoing. He was even mentioned in despatches for an incident the day before the fatal shooting when he had arrested six suspected members of the IRA without firing a shot.Mr Hutchings’ life was turned upside down when police arrived on his doorstep at his home in Cawsand, in Cornwall, at 7.30am on April 15 2015, to arrest him and search his house. He was held in a police cell, transferred on a flight to Northern Ireland and questioned 26 times over the next three days. Harold Shipman, the worst mass murderer in British legal history, was interviewed by police no more than 10 times, says Mr Hutchings.“It is totally unfair they are putting me through this,” he said. “If this was anywhere other than Northern Ireland this case would never have got this far.” His family too are devastated, his partner, 15 years his junior, struggling to cope.Mr Hutchings is scathing not only of successive prime ministers who have promised to end the prosecutions but failed to do so but the “spineless” unnamed senior military figures who have refused to give support. He reserves praise for Johnny Mercer, the former defence minister who quit in protest at the ongoing prosecutions and investigations into military veterans, and who will accompany the accused to Belfast to give his support.The two have become friends and meet regularly for lunch. Mr Mercer, the local MP in Portsmouth and a former captain in the Army, will pointedly avoid his party’s annual conference to be with Mr Hutchings. Successive prime ministers and ministers, said Mr Mercer, “have been too cowardly and weak to do anything about it”. He went on: “They don’t want to hear Dennis’s story.”After six years, a judge will finally decide Mr Hutchings’ guilt or innocence. There may well be other cases in the pipeline, with as many as 231 cases still under investigation. “The problem is,” said Mr Hutchings, “nobody really gives a s---.

Overall coverage rates here are considerably lower, for instance, than in Spain, Portugal and Denmark.You can see how the UK weighs up against other countries below.On future lockdowns and restrictions, Professor Neil Ferguson told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme the Government was very clear that it wanted to move away from social distancing measures, but it\u0027s notable, clearly, that most Western European countries have kept in place more control measures, vaccine mandates, mask-wearing mandates, and tend to have lower case numbers and certainly not case numbers which are going up as fast as we\u0027ve got. But at the end of the day this is a policy decision for Government to make.On whether people are now too relaxed, he said: Nobody likes having their freedoms curtailed by measures but it\u0027s prudent to be cautious in everyday interactions - certainly wear(ing) masks helps that, it reminds people that we\u0027re not completely out of the woods yet.Prof Ferguson was at paints to point out the country was in better shape than last year (you can compare for yourself below). Asked if the country should be worrying about another lockdown, he said: I don\u0027t think we\u0027re looking at another lockdown... the worst case here are demands on the NHS... it\u0027s very unlikely we\u0027ll see anything like the levels of deaths we saw last year, for instance.Coming into the winter, there may be a Plan B which needs to be implemented, which involves some rolling back of measures, but I doubt that we\u0027ll ever get close to lockdown we were in in January of this year.Asked if Covid booster jabs are the answer to waning immunity, Professor Neil Ferguson told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme: Absolutely, and there\u0027s data coming through now, which is not completely clear cut, but good data coming through from Israel, which shows that, if you\u0027ve had the third booster dose of the vaccine, then you get very high loads, better than even you had after the second dose.And so I do think it\u0027s critical we accelerate the booster programme.The other thing is infection rates are highest in teenagers at the moment and most other European countries are ahead of us in vaccinating teenagers and giving them two doses, not just one dose.Two doses really are needed to block infection and prevent transmission, so I think that\u0027s the other problem, keep pushing on, getting coverage rates up higher in the teenagers who are driving a lot of this infection.The Sage member said the doubling time for hospital admissions is about five weeks, so I think we need (to be) on the case, and we do need to prioritise the (booster) vaccination programme but we\u0027re not in the same position as last year.I don\u0027t think it\u0027s a reason to panic right now but I would certainly like to see vaccination booster doses accelerated, vaccination for teenagers accelerated.More from NewsPolitics latest news: Britain will be \u0026#39Qatar of hydrogen\u0026#39, Boris Johnson says as No 10 publishes net zero strategyDuchess of Cambridge: Addiction is not a choice and none of us are immunePlans to curb power of European Court of Human Rights could jeopardise Brexit trade dealServing GMP officer charged with 11 child sexual abuse offencesQueen turns down Oldie award saying ‘you are only as old as you feel’Dennis Hutchings\u0026#39 lawyers say former soldier was \u0026#39thrown to the wolves\u0026#39More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"rush heat pumps hasnt thought","story":"There’s a reason for the Government’s long-awaited Heat and Buildings Strategy being significantly delayed, which is that there was intense wrangling between the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy and the Treasury. Today, it looks as though the Treasury ultimately won that battle, given that just £450m over a three-year period will be spent on heat pump grants, capped at £5,000 a pop, which is barely sufficient to cover half the typical installation cost per home.As a consequence, energy companies and consumers - through a mix of hard-hitting regulation and levies - will pick up the tab required to meet the government’s target of installing 600,000 heat pumps each year by 2028. We are told in a prime ministerial opinion piece this morning that the public shouldn’t be worried about their bills rising, but at least three problematic components of it will assure just that.The first and most paradoxical problem is the decision to prioritise the installation of heat pumps without insulating homes first. Heat pumps use a lot of electricity, which has historically been far more expensive than gas. Installing one into an uninsulated home would therefore be extremely energy inefficient and may result in energy bill increases. This would make the whole thing as inefficient as replacing a car’s engine with a wind sail. The Heat and Buildings Strategy contains little support for insulation, even though insulting lofts, walls and windows is often more expensive than the fitting of a heat pump.The second problem is the consultation on a ‘market-based mechanism for low-carbon heat’, published alongside the strategy. In this consultation, the government proposes to force the manufacturers of gas boilers to sell a dictated number of heat pumps proportional to their fossil fuel boiler sales. This radical policy would result in people - some of whom might be the poorest in society - being forced to install expensive heat pumps, perhaps without insulation or financial support.Finally, all of this is compounded by the artificial increase in the price of gas through arbitrary Treasury levies. The Green Gas Levy will kick in next year and rumours suggest that an additional fossil fuel levy on home heating will be announced soon, only adding to the problem of already-high energy bills.Boris had an opportunity to use COP26 to focus on making the countries responsible for the lion’s share of climate change pay up. Instead he is making the British people pay with a set of incoherent policies. He shouldn’t underestimate the sheer impact this could have on his electoral prospects - especially when people begin to consider the real-life implications of buying and installing a heat pump. More from NewsPolitics latest news: Britain will be \u0026#39Qatar of hydrogen\u0026#39, Boris Johnson says as No 10 publishes net zero strategyDuchess of Cambridge: Addiction is not a choice and none of us are immunePlans to curb power of European Court of Human Rights could jeopardise Brexit trade dealServing GMP officer charged with 11 child sexual abuse offencesQueen turns down Oldie award saying ‘you are only as old as you feel’Dennis Hutchings\u0026#39 lawyers say former soldier was \u0026#39thrown to the wolves\u0026#39More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"say like nigel surely names not worse lucifer","story":"As a 63-year-old Nigel, I’ve had plenty of time to come to terms with my name falling out of fashion. But I was miffed to find that in the just-published Office for National Statistics 2020 league table of boy baby names, ‘Lucifer’ was more popular than my moniker. Fifteen were named after the devil, apparently, while Nigel didn’t appear at all.That’s a shame, frankly, because my resonant name has certainly stood me in good stead as I’ve journeyed around the world for the last 30 years writing travel features. Nigel is considered a very English name, little used beyond these shores, and that seems to suit the expectations of foreigners. One unforeseen benefit is that non-English speakers find it difficult to pronounce. I’m quite often called “Niggle”, which many will say is appropriate, and when I was a young child growing up in Singapore my amah (nursemaid) gave up completely and just called me ‘Jim’. I’ve been variously introduced as ‘Nidgle, Nig El, and – alarmingly – Knee Gel’, too.When I complained to my mother at the age of eight that I would have preferred to have been dubbed Norman (I was a big fan of the comic actor Norman Wisdom at the time) she replied that she felt Nigel had a distinguished ring to it. There is some truth in this – why else would Fortnum \u0026amp Mason sell a marmalade called Sir Nigel’s? That’s named in honour of the 1920s actor-manager Sir Nigel Playfair, and there is a theatrical lineage here. The talented Nigels Havers, Hawthorne and Planer are fine examples, although my name cred did take a dent when Ken Dodd decided to give one of his Diddymen the less than flattering title Nigel Ponsonby-Smallpiece. Nigel last made the ONS top 100 boys’ names in 1974, ranked at number 55, before dropping out completely in 2016, then making a reappearance. On the 2020 list, Hudsons, Sonnys and Myleses abound: plus the 189 boys that are called Kylo, not to mention the 142 Kacpers and 64 Cais.According to the stats, 1963 was the peak year for calling boys Nigel. That means I and some far more illustrious names such as racing driver Nigel Mansell, musician Nigel Kennedy and (let’s be inclusive here) Nigella Lawson were several years ahead of the trend, natch. A year later Nigel Farage was born, after which things clearly went downhill. In 1979 XTC’s hit song Making Plans For Nigel was certainly catchy but on closer inspection gave the impression that Nigels tended to be staid and boring with overprotective parents and a guaranteed future in British Steel. On reflection, this probably explains the problems I encountered getting to know girls in my early 20s. Then, in the 1980s, the Australians developed the very unfair slang term ‘Nigel no friends’, while the lead guitarist in the 1984 satirical rock band movie This Is Spinal Tap was, inevitably, a Nigel.I wouldn’t want to be anyone but a Nigel, though. My wife was christened Frances but then changed her name to the endlessly popular Alice simply through common usage. I would never do that. You are what you are named, just as you end up with the face that stares back at you from the mirror every morning. Some like to call me Nige, which is endearing but ugly, while others say I’m very much a Nigel, which is disconcerting but better than being an obvious Adolf. Could my now very middle-aged-sounding name come back in vogue? I fancy so. When my wife and I named our two children we consulted a crossword dictionary (I’m a writer – OK?) and chose names that were big on “l”. Others just look their newborn baby in the tiny eye and think yes, that’s a – well, Nigel. Apparently my name derives from the Old Gaelic word Niall, meaning champion, and if it was good enough for my mother and father, that’s certainly good enough for me.More from NewsPolitics latest news: Britain will be \u0026#39Qatar of hydrogen\u0026#39, Boris Johnson says as No 10 publishes net zero strategyDuchess of Cambridge: Addiction is not a choice and none of us are immunePlans to curb power of European Court of Human Rights could jeopardise Brexit trade dealServing GMP officer charged with 11 child sexual abuse offencesQueen turns down Oldie award saying ‘you are only as old as you feel’Dennis Hutchings\u0026#39 lawyers say former soldier was \u0026#39thrown to the wolves\u0026#39More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"boris carries tier 4 busting","story":"Boris and Carries Tier -busting Christmas Day denial smells like festive porkie piesBoris Johnson and his we Carrie may be denying any wrongdoing in having their friend Nimco Ali visit Number  on Christmas Day, but what a kick in the teeth to the millions of us who went without family and friends for the greater good, writes Flic Everett and Carrie Johnson walk along the beach\" content\"https:i-prod.mirror incoming article.ece ALTERNATES n _JS.jpg\" width\"\" \"\" Boris and Carrie Johnson found themselves in hot water after it emerged their friend joined them in Number  for Christmas Day  - despite London being in Tier  lockdown Image: Getty ImagesopinionByFlic Everett:,  Oct | commentsLet’s start with denial, a state with which our Prime Minister is comfortably familiar.According to Boris and his we Carrie, they spent last Christmas all alone, much like many of us in the UK.There were no visitors, no fun and the chief excitement was translating A Christmas Carol into Latin to amuse little Wilfred. According to US Harper’s Magazine, however - which being American has fact-checkers coming out of its jewel-encrusted ears - the PM is telling festive-spiced porkie pies.According to the magazine, Nimco Ali, their friend and godmother to Wilfred, secretly spent last Christmas at Number . A spokeswoman for Carrie Johnson, however, snaps: “The PM and Mrs Johnson have followed coronavirus rules at all times. It is totally untrue to suggest otherwise.”How do you feel about the news the Prime Minister had a friend join them on Christmas Day  Have your say in the comments below Their definition of ‘rules’ can be hazy though, as we all know. In fact, it’s not the first time Tory-supporting campaigner and FGM activist Ali has hit the news. Last year she was appointed the government’s adviser on tackling violence against women and girls. It later emerged that she had been given the job via a “direct appointment process”, without any advertisement or competition for the £-a-day role.Employment ethics aside, when Ali was allegedly enjoying the prime ministerial mince pies, the PM’s subjects were not so lucky.Just before Christmas last year, the government screeched into a Bambi-on-ice U-turn, ditching its previously easy-going approach to festive lockdown rules, and plunging the vast swathes of the south eastright back into Tier  with its draconian ‘no mixing’ rules – which meant no mingling with anyone not from your household. For the rest of the country, some mixing was allowed on Christmas Day only, which meant long-anticipated family visits and trips all had to be scrapped with just a couple of days warning, large turkeys were chucked away and carefully chosen kids’ presents hidden until spring when visits could once again resume. But none of the practical dficulties we all suddenly faced compared to the waves of disappointment and sadness. For some, it would have been the last time they’d see their elderly parents – and even that bittersweet joy was gone.  After almost a year living under the brutal strictures of the pandemic, Christmas was a light in the darkness, suddenly extinguished, with long-awaited family togetherness reduced to a Zoom call and a ready meal for one. After a year when children couldn’t see their friends, they now couldn’t see their cousins to exchange gts and play games either, and single people, orcees, the lonely elderly and all the recently Covid-bereaved were left to stare at their TV alone. It’s a bleak picture, but reportedly one that didn’t trouble the man tasked with leading our beleaguered country through its most painful period of loss, fear and damage since World War II. At Downing Street, perhaps there was togetherness – an exchange of presents, laughter and fun. They wouldn’t have wanted their close friend to be alone at Christmas. Few, in fact, wanted that. And yet so many did it for the greater good, afraid of spreading a deadly disease for which there was not yet a vaccine. Personal sacrice was writ large in every abandoned visit and unbought gt. If it transpires that Johnson and his we didn’t do the same, by this Christmas he should, at long last, be out of a job.

The overwhelming majority of British Muslims like me detest Islamist extremism. Islamists are dferent to Muslims. The former seek to politicise Islam, stamp its superiority into state structures, and place Sharia laws within the heart of institutions. Whereas Muslims seek to practise their faith on a personal basis and within the secular framework of our society. The vast majority of British Muslims are not Islamists.  Islamists should be viewed as preying like wolves on British Muslim communities, looking for the vulnerable and the marginalised, to inculcate them with their poisonous rhetoric. Sadly, in the past two to three years there has been little work done by this Government on tackling Islamist extremism. There has been no community-focused work tackling Islamist networks online or in small but vocal sections of Muslim communities. There needs to be a rapid and hard change of tack. These networks and influencers must be disrupted.From coronavirus to Brexit, our daily politics newsletter is there to guide you these turbulent times. The newsletter is sent out twice daily with the latest UK  world politics news, along with leading opinion and analysis.You can sign up here.  And those in Muslim communities who want to speak out against such extremism need to be actively supported. Time and time again, when brave British Muslims have spoken out against Islamism, they have been targeted and smeared by such networks. This cannot be allowed to continue. There are many British Muslims willing to stand up for our country’s values and its collective safety and security. The best message the Government can send to those who seek to harm and ide us, is there are Muslims willing to reclaim their faith from the twisted rhetoric of extremists. This is essential for race and faith relations in our country.

When he must have looked in that pair of eyes who’ve miserably failed humanity and just thought… why It’s ironic that Sir David died while doing what he thought he was born for to do: talking to and working for the people he felt responsible for. He trusted people and he was the most trusted. When I first met David Amess, he was still a new MP from Basildon. It was during an annual conference of the Conservative Party in  where at the end, he was willing to sign our petition. I had strong feelings about him from the very first moment. His warm character, his unique humour. Even though I never would believe that our own struggle for liberating Iran from dictatorship would take a few decades, I felt that I would be friends with David for a very long time. Throughout the years, when we reached out to UK parliamentarians, he was one of the most active and helpful people in the lower house. He was the kind of constituency MP who appears to be married to his own people. But not only his own, it was actually all the people. Every time we wandered into his office, we bypassed his gallery of pictures where well-known faces posed with Sir David’s beautul smile. You could see him and his family with the Pope and Mother Theresa as well. When reaching his desk, he’d just say “What do you want, Hossein  What can I do for you ” And he almost immediately would ask his secretary to bring the calendar to open a slot for us. He never said no to anybody. Or maybe just to himself. He played a crucial role alongside Andrew MacKinlay when we were fighting the UK blacklist against our organisation. After Lord Corbet passed away, he became the leader of the British Committee for Iran Freedom . When our brothers and sisters in Camp Ashraf in Iraq were under attack by Iran-backed militiamen, I woke Sir David up at am and all I heard was, “How can I help ” Once, he had a planned surgery in Southend West when we asked him to lead the British delegation in the Free Iran Summit of  in Albania. But he finally managed to get himself a plane and made it to Ashraf  by . CEST, rushed on the stage, and held his arms high with the books of both Houses’ support for the cause of bringing freedom and democracy to Iran.He always told his family about me and my friends, calling us “the true champions of human rights” and he would say that the things that he was doing for his people are nothing in comparison. We always disagreed and I told him that all I’m doing is for the Iranian “Sir Davids” to run my country. But after what happened to him, I believe he was literally a true champion of human rights and humanity.  When former Speaker of the House of Commons John Bercow gave a speech at Sir David’s th anniversary in the lower chamber, he charmingly pointed out how Sir David has always been the backbencher. That he had been running many important sessions and helped make many important decisions but never claimed credit for anything. He was never seeking a name or driving attention to himself.It was ashe was in for the “small things”. Even for the sake of explaining, I’m still ashamed to put it that way. These were the most important steps. Sir David did everything to turn Southend into a city. He was a staunch supporter of the Southend football team. When he and Penny Mordaunt helped to get  children with learning disabilities to play at the Royal Albert Hall, it was like one of his greatest achievements. Or maybe it actually was.When we visited his constituency, everyone was crying. An old man told us how much Sir David was loved. He said that he’s got a sick we and the only person who would care was Sir David. A young man approached us with wet eyes and started to talk about Sir David. When words failed to express feelings, they’d just say: “Amess was Amess.”  At his office, people were in shock and awe. Everyone was crying. People wanted to talk to us as they knew how dear he was to the Iranians. Especially his fellow parliamentarians. Those pictures at the office looked dferent now. Like all those great men and women were sad too.The very fact that he was so in love with his work and his people made it very hard for me to ask him for help on issues that were happening thousands of miles away. I felt guilty, asI was stealing him from his people. But he was the kindest to reach out to and after all, we were his people too. His Ayes Ears belonged to everyone.It’s tragic that people’s true value of le is only appreciated after their passing, and I believe we’re just too busy with ourselves that we fail to see and feel others when they’re around. But Sir David proved that politics is all about the “small things” and the “common people” rather than in the higher echelons of power. He was a kind of a mentor to me and I’m sure to the younger generation who might enter politics. He taught us that politics isn’t just about to be trusted, it’s about to trust. And he paid for it very dearly. Because Amess was Amess and his achievements will live on... far beyond Southend West.

But we haven’t actually had visitors yet! We are still only seeing our ‘core support bubble’ who are all being very cautious for Daniel’s sake. With just one exception where all rules were followed, we haven’t seen anyone outside of our support network. Writing to her loved ones, Lola said: As I have chosen not to receive the Covid vaccine during my pregnancy I am entering a period of isolation to protect both me and my baby in the run up to his birth. This just means I won’t be accepting visitors outside of my immediate support network for now, however once he has arrived I also have very specic ideas about how I plan to keep him safe from covid and any other risks. I have detailed these below to avoid any awkward conversations later and I trust that you will all respect my wishes. Lola said many of her followers are new mums and mums-to-be, who supported the rules sheaposd outlined and sent her messages saying they agreed with her. Some followers said they were having the same concerns about people meeting their babies, but they werenapost sure how to set boundaries. The new mum said: I also had lots of women who already had their children saying how they wish they had had the courage to send a similar message out when they had their own children. To those that think my rules are too strict, I’d say that it’s up to me how I choose to keep my baby safe and I am the only person responsible for him.  Lolaaposs nine rules are:We will not be accepting general visitors outside of our immediate support network in the first few weeks of coming home. When we do start having visitors, we will need them to remove shoes, outside clothing , and wash hands with soap and sanitizer. If we have said that it’s okay for you to visit, we ask that you take a lateral flow test on the day and send a photo to show that it’s negative. It goes without saying thatyou test positive oryou feel at all unwell, then you MUST reschedule your visit. Our new home is a non-smoking home, and we also ask that visitors do not smokefor the entire duration of their visit and at least an hour before arriving. . Please don’t show up drunk to meet the baby. You won’t be allowed in. Please do not assume that just because you have been invited to visit that you will get the chance to hold the baby. It is very unlikely that I will want to pass him around until he is bigger and has a stronger immune system. If you are lucky enough to get some cuddles on your visit, please do not kiss the baby. Until he is bigger there is to be no kissing, and even then nobody is to kiss his face, hands, or feet. This goes for everyone and there will be no exceptions on this request. We do not require guests to buy us presents, butyou wish to bring a gt please do not purchase second hand goods . We are not adverse to hand-me-downs and we have already received lots of lovely nice things from our friends family but only mummy gets to decide where we accept worn or used goods from. Finally, mum knows best. If mummy says no, asks for her baby back, or wants guests to leave for any reason, then please just do so without a fuss.Sending the rules out, Lola wrote: I know there are a lot of requests here, but I think that they are all very reasonable and easy to follow. None of the above is up for debate, and soyou aren’t sure you can comfortably follow these instructions then please don’t ask to visit. If you think you can, then we are really excited about meeting you all when the time is right! Lots of Love, Lola and Baby D .Do you have rules for visitors coming to see your baby  Email jessica.taylor@reachplcComment MORE ON BabiesPregnancyGiving birthCoronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

A woman aged  and a boy aged  are being treated in Glasgow Royal Infirmary, and a man aged  is being treated in the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow. An -year-old boy is being treated in the Royal Hospital for Sick Children. Two houses appeared to have been completely destroyed in the blast in Gorse Park, Ayr, South Ayrshire. Aerial images show debris strewn around the blast site with the roof of a neighbouring house caved in. Emergency services remained on the scene this morning after the blast, which happened at around .pm yesterday.  Chief Inspector Derrick Johnston, area commander for South Ayrshire, said: Police received a report of an explosion at Gorse Park in the KIncaidston area of Ayr around .pm last night. Emergency services attended and a number of houses were evacuated. A family of four were taken to hospital. A -year-old woman and a -year-old boy are currently within Glasgow Royal Infirmary. A -year-old male is currently within Queen Elizabeth University Hospital and an -year-old is within the Royal Hospital for Sick Children. This is a complex incident and dferent agencies are working together to establish he full circumstances of what happened. Our thoughts are with the family and everyone in the local community affected by this.  A joint investigation with Scottish Fire and Rescue Service is being carried out.A neighbour, who works in the gas industry, told how he saw hero nurses and a first aider running to the scene, Daily Record reports.He said: “I was standing at the back door, getting ready to take my dog out when I heard this massive explosion. “There were big white flashes which is what happens when there’s a large concentration of gas. “The back door flew open so I ran round to see what had happened and the place was just covered in debris. “It’s quite a confined square where the properties are so an explosion like that just channelled the power all down into dferent streets.  “I was telling people to stay away. Someone was trying to get a water hose but you can’t do that. “There’s quite a few nurses that live in this area because the hospital is close by so I saw them all come running to help. There’s also a first aider who ran across to try and help. “There was just so much noise and commotion. You couldn’t really hear or tellanyone was in there. “I know one of the people who lives in one of the attached houses and looking at it, it’s going to be condemned. “I could see flames coming from where the boiler would’ve been. They’re normally in the centre of these properties and they’re surrounded by brick. “Gas is heavier than air so it would’ve built up within the house. It’s actually blown the top of the house off and totally shredded it. “It’s a row of terraced houses so they’re all attached internally from wall to wall. So the stress ripped through the neighbouring houses too. “The sides have come off and the inside has all fallen down. “Some of the other properties within that square have PVC front doors and windows. They’ve just blown right in because of the force of the blast.

Dennis Hutchings, , a former member of the Le Guards Regiment from Cornwall, denied attempting to murder and cause grievous bodily harm to John Pat Cunningham. Mr Cunningham, , who had a learning dficulty, was fatally shot in the back as he ran from an Army patrol near Benburb, County Tyrone, in .The trial of Mr Hutchings, who was suffering from kidney disease, had earlier been adjourned for three weeks after he tested positive for coronavirus.The non-jury trial had been sitting at Belfast Crown Court for three days a week to allow him to receive dialysis treatment. It is understood that he died on Monday, PA news reports. His death was confirmed by an Army veteransapos group on behalf of his family. Defence barrister James Lewis QC had informed the court that Mr Hutchingsapos condition had been confirmed by a PCR test on Saturday. He said his client was not well… as one would expect with his other comorbidities of renal failure and cardiac mal”. Mr Justice OaposHara, presiding over the non-jury trial, said: Things have obviously deteriorated over the weekend with his positive test for Covid.” Adjourning the trial until Monday  November, he added: It is simply not possible to continue to trial in his absence.” In a statement, the Northern Ireland Veterans Movement said: It is with regret and with the permission of his son John Hutchings that we sadly report that our brave friend Regiment Corporal Major Dennis Hutchings passed away in the Mater Hospital this evening.”  Mr Hutchings was the first veteran charged with an offence during the Troubles and had denied a count of attempted grievous bodily harm with intent. In , a -year-old Mr Cunningham was shot dead as he ran away from an Army patrol across a field near Benburb. People who knew him said he had the mental age of a child and was known to have a deep fear of soldiers. Following Mr Hutchingsapos death, Democratic Unionist Party leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson called it “desperately sad news”, but said that “serious questions” needed to be answered. “Whilst understanding the desire of the Cunningham family for justice, we have consistently challenged those in legal authority who insisted that Dennis stand trial again,” he said in a statement. “He was an -year-old veteran, in ill-health on dialysis and there was a lack of compelling new evidence. “There now stands serious questions around those who made the decision that Dennis should stand trial once more. He was honourable. He wanted to clear his name again but was dragged to a court and hounded until his death. “This is a sad indictment on those who want to rewrite history but also demands serious questions of the Public Prosecution Service about how this trial was deemed to be in the public interest.” In a statement, Traditional Unionist Voiceleader Jim Allister said: “The needless dragging of an -year-old soldier, Dennis Hutchings, through the courts has had a very sad end with the passing of Mr Hutchings this evening. “The strain on this man was cruel, with him requiring regular dialysis, while being brought to Belfast to face a trial of dubious provenance. “My thoughts and prayers tonight are with his family and friends who may understandably feel that what he was put through contributed to his decline.”Most ReadFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Coronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

They turned up at service run by Homeless Project Scotland at Hielenmanaposs Umbrella in Glasgow, who say it was the first time they have been approached by family with such a young child. Staff at the soup kitchen were concerned by the heart-breaking scene.Chairperson Colin McIness told Glasgow Live : It was a mum and a dad with a -day-old child. I think it was not last week but the week before.They came along to soup kitchen and askedthey could get help to find accommodation. Weaposve never dealt with anyone with a child that young before. The parents looked in okay health. Obviously they looked stressed and they looked a bit happy to see help.  The baby was -days-old and they [the parents] obviously needed assistance from us to help them get them into accommodation. It was quite an unusual situation. Homeless Project Scotland, which also runs outreach support in the city, refers people on to Glasgow City Council’s case work team. The council were able to find the couple and baby a place to stay. The council accommodated them in a BaposnaposB and then later offered them a temporary furnished flat. The charity is still in contact with them, Colin added. The charity say they have helped accommodate more than  rough sleepers on the streets of Glasgow city centre in the last few weeks, including  in the first week in October - many of whom were recently released from prison. It comes just weeks after the charity said they were left heartbroken after two schoolchildren queued up on a school night with their mum at the soup kitchen. Until then, it was the first time in  soup kitchens that the charity has put on that children of that age had attended the soup kitchen.In February of this year, shocking photos showing  homeless people queueing up for a soup kitchen in Glasgow revealed the extent of the homeless crisis in the UK.According to government statistics, children made up % of the , households assessed to be homeless or threatened with homeless in Scotland. Glasgow had the highest number of homeless households in Scotland, and compromises  per cent of the total. This is up from  per cent, the figure it stood at in  .The end of the government’s eviction ban, combined with redundancies since the pandemic and the scrapping of the £ Universal Credit increase, mean many more could soon find themselves with nowhere to live.Town hall leaders warned that next year, Council house waiting lists could double with one in  people trapped in the queue for more than five years.

Vaccine centres in Leeds, Plymouth and Hampshire have been pictured virtually empty apart from staff manning the deserted jab sites. This has raised concerns as Covid cases continue to rise and in recent days have reached some of the highest levels of the last few months. Only .million of the .million eligible adults have taken up their covid- booster jabs so far this autumn. This has led to to top scientists warning the rollout continues to be too slow and efforts must be taken to speed it up.  Speaking on Radio ’s World At One programme, Professor Andrew Hayward, a SAGE adviser and University College London expert, said: “I think it’s concerning that we’ve got very high rates of infection and higher rates of hospitalisation and mortality than many of our European counterparts. “Whenever we approach a winter period we expect respiratory virus infections to increase, so I think it’s very important that we go into that with as high a level of population immunity, especially in elderly and clinically vulnerable groups, as possible. We need to get the vaccination rates up and to be prepared, potentially, to think about other measuresthings do get out of control.  We prioritised those who were most vulnerable - the elderly and those with chronic diseases - to be vaccinated first, so theyaposve had the longest time for their immunity to start to wane.Thataposs why itaposs so vital this booster programme gets done as soon as possible. In September, the government’s scientic advisers recommend that everyone over  should be offered a third booster jab, as well as medical staff, and younger adults with medical conditions. Only people who had had their second jab six months or more ago would be invited for a third. New estimatessuggest  million people will be eligible for a third jab by mid-December.However at the current rate, all of the most at risk people will not be jabbed until the end of January. Latest figures show the UK is currently recording five times more cases of Covid- per million people than Germany, and  times more than Spain. Rising case rates has sparked calls for the government to bring in its ‘Plan B’ including bringing back compulsory mask wearing indoors, and encouraging working from home.

Douglas heard from his girlfriend, Sophie McCormick, who worked at Asda Huyton, that Mr Arnold was at the supermarket branch and went after him, prompted by the victim’s acrimonious break-up with Douglas’ sister, Marie. CCTV cameras captured what followed, as he bit Mr Arnold in the exact place the victim had previously suffered another bite. David Watson, prosecuting, said Mr Arnold and Miss Douglas had a five-year-old child together. However, by February , , when the brawl occurred, they had been separated in what was apparently an acrimonious split for around six to eight months.  Mr Watson said Mr Arnold had started a new relationship with a woman called Fay Murray, with whom he had fathered twins. The twins were reportedly ill at the time. Mr Arnold and Miss Murray went to the Asda store at around .pm, when the latter went into the shop and Mr Arnold remained in his Ford Galaxy in a bid to avoid the defendantaposs girlfriend Sophie McCormick, who he knew worked there. Evidently, Sophie McCormick on seeing Faye Murray did contact the defendant,” the prosecutor said. Douglas subsequently turned up at the store with his dad around .pm, at which time he was seen running into the supermarket and saying where is he  before he approached Mr Arnold and shouted: Alright Ryan. Mr Watson said the victim was concerned his car would be damaged so got out, with the engine still running, but Douglas jumped into the driveraposs seat and drove the Ford around the car park. He said: Ryan Arnoldaposs next recollection is the defendant and James Snow standing directly in front of him, calling him a aposgrassapos and a aposratapos. The defendant, who can be seen to be in a highly animated, agitated state throughout on the CCTV footage, is seen to lean into Ryan Arnold, who describes himself being bitten to the left ear. Miss Murray rang the police and Mr Arnold described himself as being frightened and confused and in a lot of pain and distress. He went to Whiston Hospital, where he was treated for two cm bite marks to either side of his left ear, which required stitches. Mr Watson said the bite was in the same place as a signicant bite injury, which he suffered around  years earlier. He said the victim needed a tetanus booster and three months later still had pain in his ear, already disfigured by the previous bite. Douglas was arrested at home on February  and denied the attack, but ahead of a trial in September admitted wounding. Mr Watson said Mr Arnold was now back in a relationship with Miss Douglas. Douglas, of Mardale Road, Huyton, has four previous convictions for six offences, including dishonesty. He was fined in October  after threatening to damage his mumaposs windows. Desmond Lennon, defending, said his client accepted his guilt, despite claims made in a pre-sentence report, and was “sorry and ashamed” for what he had done.The barrister said Douglas, who has cystic fibrosis, diabetes and arthritis, endured a very dficult childhood. However, he had been in a stable relationship with his girlfriend, the barrister said, for five years and hoped to start a family with her.Mr Lennon said Douglas had responsibility for a -year-old sister, who lives with him and his partner and is at college. Both she and his girlfriend would sufferhe was jailed, he said. Douglas had stopped drinking and smoking cannabis, the lawyer said, and was behaving in a “more restrained” way. Mr Lennon pointed out that rehabilitation was more likely for Douglashe addressed the root cause of his offending. Judge Woodhall said Douglas was unfit to work, his partner was his full time carer and accepted he had dficulties in childhood. For whatever reason, the judge said, there was history between Douglas and Mr Arnold, following his victimaposs acrimonious split with his sister. The judge said: You were contacted and told, I have no doubt, there had been either a confrontation inside [Asda] or that his partner was inside, and therefore you wanted to intervene. As you describe it yourself, you had seen red, you were pumped up, you were angry, you were agitated. The judge said Douglas got in Mr Arnoldaposs car and drove it around to wind him up, before confronting him. The CCTV footage shows youaposre highly animated and agitated, unlike your victim,” he said. You walked up to him, pulled his head in towards you and bit his ear. Judge Woodhall said: Your sister and Mr Arnold are now reconciled. That causes some concern because it means Mr Arnold is still in the family. The judge said he had to sentence Douglas in a way to best manage future risk and agreed Douglas had a realistic prospect of rehabilitation. He therefore handed him  weeks - around  months - in prison, suspended for  months. The judge also imposed a six-month home curfew, between pm and am daily, a -day Rehabilitation Activity Requirement and £ court costs.

Flats in Chelmsley Wood, Birmingham, are reportedly becoming targeted by fly-tippers who also leave piles of junk and furniture on street corners. Landlord Solihull Community Housing said aerial fly-tipping had become a frequent issue at the flats and vowed to take action against those responsible.Residents in neighbouring flat Oriel House, a short distance away, had received a warning after items - including “bags of excrement” - were thrown from windows, reports Birmingham Live.Tenants received a letter from Solihull Council about the environmental crime after some inappropriately disposed of their mess.  BirminghamLive visited several tower blocks in the Solihull area on October , all of which were clean and tidy with the exception of Bangor House. Emil Kerekes, a neighbour of the flat, which houses mostly council tenants, said the mess was a daily occurrence.The -year-old pastor runs the nearby Connection Church Centre with its own community cafe.He said he had witnessed residents throwing dirty nappies out of the window and told how he was verbally abused when he challenged them.  Emil said: Iaposve seen people from the top floors throwing nappies out of the windows. I tried to tell them it wasnapost nice and they swore at me. He said it was important the area was clean and tidy to help the well-being of the community. Itaposs not good for business, itaposs not good for the environment, itaposs not good for anybody, he said.  I think itaposs down to education. People need to see that what they are doing is wrong. Emile added that while it was due to the selfish actions of a small number of residents, he had seen problems with rubbish persist for at least three years. I donapost think itaposs a big number. Itaposs just a couple of people. I think most people are responsible, he added. But it happens regularly, thataposs the problem. Itaposs not like it has just happened once, it is every week.  Fiona Hughes, chief executive at Solihull Community Housing, said: “We have a team of estate assistants who work hard to maintain a good standard around our high-rise buildings. Unfortunately, there are some residents who choose to throw their rubbish out of the window rather than using the bin chutes provided. This behaviour is completely unacceptable and we will take action against any resident found to be doing this as they are breaking the terms of their tenancy agreement. Aerial fly-tipping has become a frequent issue around Bangor House and we are currently exploring new initiatives to help tackle the problem. A multi-agency approach has been introduced to support the maintenance of the area and help us identy those who are responsible. We encourage residents to share any information they have with us and report incidents of fly-tipping as soon as possible”.

It is now a shadow of its former self, as these eerie photos from the Abandoned UK Facebook page show boarded-up structures that used to house dodgems and other rides have started to fall apart, reported the Daily Star. There are many hidden dangers but that has not deterred explorers from creeping onto the site. It has become the second-highest visited destination by them, and they trespass on the expansive site risking their lives, according to Grimsby Live. The sign for the Dodgems hangs high next to Kiddiesapos Cove. Nearby you can almost still hear the screams from the Razzle Dazzle, Ala Kazam, The Obliterator and The Pendulus. Ali Babaaposs Arcade still stands but is empty. Some reports claim that the last of the items were sold off in October , as the carousel sold for a six-figure sum over two years ago just before going up for auction. Vast amounts of material which has been recycled. Cleethorpes Light Railway have the track from the site. The go-kart track is massively overgrown. There is also evidence of fires started deliberately which is a sad legacy for a previously joyful place. Reports say bulldozers were meant to be hitting the site in June to make way for a Lidl store and a vast -eco lodge holiday centre. Plans also include a hotel and conference centre and food hall. Abandoned UK posted the eerie images from their exploration of the site in . Fans reminiscing over their time at the popular family attraction were sad to have seen it disappear.  One commenter said: Sad to see it like this, I remember when it first opened then, later on, worked there in . As most would say it wasn’t the best of theme parks but the kids loved it and made a great day out for them, had some good memories there. Another wrote: Always makes me sad to see abandoned theme parks after it made so many good memories. Camelot looks sorry for itself and I loved it there. Still, the spookier the better. A third added: This one makes me feel a little sad, being local to it I spent many a fun day with my mates there in the summer holidays and then with my own children. Such a shame it was left to go the way it did when it had so much potential to get even better.

Now, properties in the area are decaying, overgrown by shrubs and trees.Properties on Dale Farm in Essex are decaying Image: Spartacus   SplashNewsByChiara Fiorillo:,  Oct Updated:,  Oct | commentsPictures have emerged from an eerie Travellers camp that was abandoned and left to rot  years ago. In , Dale Farm in Essex was the scene of one of Britainaposs largest and most violent evictions. The Travellers community who lived there was evicted by Basildon Council because it wanted to build new housing on the land. However, new photos show that the construction of new buildings never started, and instead the properties that people once called home are decaying, overgrown by shrubs and trees. Marble flooring is still visible, as well as charred remains from the fires that raged the site and electricity points are still attached to walls.  Even a police public order fire extinguisher could be seen amongst the rubble, an image shows. Among other things, childrenaposs toys and garden tools were left in the area and were never removed. Travellers living nearby have spoken out  years after the evictions, saying they were asked to leave as the council wanted to build new housing, but this never happened. Dale Farm was once the largest illegal Travellers site in Europe, with , people living there at one point.  The evictions at the camp in Crays Hill, Essex, took a long time and were delayed multiple times in  after a decade-long planning row.Once, they were delayed due to fears bats could have made the land their home.At the time, we reported that the High Court postponed the eviction three times. When police moved in to clear the site in October ,  officers and six residents were injured, with  protesters arrested.  It is estimated the evictions cost nearly £million in taxpayersapos money. Basildon Council were hit with a bill for £.m while Essex Police spent £.m on their involvement.Mary Sheridan, a woman who lived at Dale Farm for eight years and was among those evicted in , ed to the site two years later and told Socialist Worker : I was happy living here.But look at how we have to live now. We’re living in filth. Another Traveller, Martin OaposLeary, said the area he used to live on had become a pothole, a swimming pool for rats.Now, it is believed that around  Travellers live on a permanent Traveller site neighbouring the Dale Farm land, according to Basildon Echo News.However, the community is reportedly fed up of Basildon and wants to move away from south Essex. The Mirror has contacted Basildon Council for comment.

She teamed it with tan heels and a matching bag.And in her speech, she called for compassion and empathy for those who are struggling with addiction.She said: Addiction is not a choice. No one chooses to become an addict. But it can happen to any one of us. None of us are immune. Yet it’s all too rarely discussed as a serious mental health condition. And seldom do we take the time to uncover and fully understand its fundamental root causes.The journey towards addiction is often multi-layered and complex. But, by recognising what lies beneath addiction, we can help remove the taboo and shame that sadly surrounds it.As a society, we need to start from a position of compassion and empathy. Where we nurture those around us, understand their journey, and what has come before them.We need to value and prioritise care and support, helping to restore and connect iniduals who are clearly suffering, to the people around them.

That is why I am so passionate about the work of The Forward Trust, an organisation I am so proud to be patron of. This is the work that you, and many other charities, provide day in, day out. And it is needed now, more than ever.Kate also talked about the effect of the pandemic and how the number of those struggling with addiction is higher than ever before.  She added: The pandemic has had a devastating impact on addiction rates. And families and children are having to cope with addiction in greater numbers than ever before.We know that over one and a half million people across the UK who did not have substance misuse prior to lockdown, may now be experiencing problems associated with increased alcohol consumption.Around two million iniduals who were identied as being in recovery, may have experienced a relapse over the past  months. And almost one million young people and children are showing an increase in addictive behaviour since the pandemic began.Yet, there is hope. Over the last ten years, I have had the privilege of meeting many incredible people who have lived through the harsh realities of addiction. Through their own hard work, and with the help from communities and charities, such as The Forward Trust, lives really are being turned around.These are stories of healing, of hope and recovery, that can inspire us all.I fully support The ‘Taking Action on Addiction’ campaign to improve awareness and understanding of addiction. The campaign will show us that, not only do many people recover from addiction, they can go on to prosper. Led by the Forward Trust alongside a number of charity partners, Taking Action on Addiction is a long-term campaign which will work to improve awareness and understanding of addiction, its causes and scale in society to enable more people to ask for and receive help.The launch of the new campaign comes as this week is Addiction Awareness Week, which aims to highlight the challenges of addiction and help people and families affected by it.Kate became the patron of the Forward Trust in June, when the charity merged with Action on Addiction, one of her first royal patronages on joining the royal family.

But when it comes to choosing baby names in the UK, it seems many parents tend to think alike - with several favourite names seeming to top the charts every year. Names like Amelia and Isla often top the list of girlsapos names, with Jack and James always being firm favourites for newborn boys.  And the top choice for both girls and boys remains unchanged this year - with Olivia and Oliver taking first preference among parents in England and Wales for the eighth year in a row. However, it seems these names tend to be most popular with older parents, as the data also showed that younger parents favoured shorter names like Leo and Theo for boys and Ava and Ivy for girls.  For more of the news you care about straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here Data from the Office for National Statistics shows that, for both boysapos and girlsapos names, the top  was slightly changed. Whereas Grace and Freya made the shortlist the previous year,  data shows those favourites had been replaced by Ivy and Rosie.And Charlie was knocked out of the top  for boysapos names for the first time since  - being replaced by Archie, which could have been influenced by Prince Harry and Meghan Markleaposs son.

Statistics from the last  years show boysapos names Arthur and Noah have soared up the ranks in popularity to rank in the top five in .

According to the ONS, parents over the age of  were more likely to choose traditional names while younger parents tended to choose modern, shortened names. Sian Bradford from the ONS said: Oliver and Olivia held on to the top spots as the most popular boysapos and girlsapos names in  but some interesting changes took place beneath them. We continue to see the age of mothers having an impact on the choice of baby name. Archie jumped into the top  boysapos names for the first time, driven by younger mothers as well as the obvious royal link, while on the girlsapos side, Ivy rose to sixth place. Popular culture continues to provide inspiration for baby names, whether itaposs characters in our favourite show or trending celebrities.

Her recent video hit more than seven million views and resulted in her receiving horric abuse online,Manchester Evening News reports. The mum, from Wigan, told her followers about her daughter Parker falling ill RSV - or respiratory syncytial virus - when she was five weeks old. RSV is a viral illness that causes symptoms such as breathing problems and can lead to more severe bronchiolitis and pneumonia in young babies. Get all the latest news sent to your inbox.for the free Mirror newsletter She describes how Parker, who is now four months old, had to be moved from AE to a high dependency unit where she was put on a machine to do the breathing for her. The youngster was diagnosed with a severe chest infection but thankfully began to recover with the help of antibiotics. In the video, she had also said Parker spent the night with her gran - who lives a -minute drive away, before falling ill.  Many TikTok users blasted the mum for letting Parker have her first sleepover with her gran the night before she fell ill. One wrote: Jesus, five weeks and you are done with it already  Poor child isnapost gonna grow up the best. Another said: This is neglect. How could you do that to your newborn. Zoe has shared her own video hitting back at the comments. She told MEN: I posted the video originally to share my daughter’s story with RSV.  It made her very poorly and I was unaware how serious it could be in newborns. I hadn’t even heard about it until she was poorly and I wanted to make other mums aware of the signs. I had mentioned that she stayed with my mum the night before falling ill to show how quickly she declined but it wasn’t taken that way. People in the comments have branded me a bad mum because of my decision to allow my mum to have my child overnight.  To me, personally, it’s pretty normal for new mums to get support in anyway from family members but I didn’t know it would be so controversial online. I do regret mentioning her staying at my mumaposs because of the hate I have received, but I don’t regret sharing my daughteraposs story, because it could help save another child’s le. Zoe, who also has a three-year-old son Dominic with partner David Hunt, , also spoke about some of the disgusting comments she received. She said: The most hurtful is that I’m neglecting my children, I’m a bad parent, that my daughter deserved to die because she wouldn’t have bad parents. That I don’t deserve children or I shouldn’t have childrenI’m too lazy to look after them. The main hate I received was along the lines of aposhow could you leave your babyapos  It just shocked me how it’s encouraged as a new mum to accept help from people you trust because it can be overwhelming, but as soon as you do it’s seen as neglectful. I think the video going viral has proven the double standards for mums, there’s a lot of mum shaming and I don’t think it’s fair. Zoe, who is on maternity leave from her job at McDonaldaposs, said sheaposs been more willing to accept help from her mum with Parker as she was reluctant with Dominic despite suffering from postnatal depression. Zoe first started posting videos to TikTok during the lockdown and now has more than , followers. She said: I will carry on with it because at the end of the day itaposs my choice ultimately - my kids are fine and my kids are happy. They love spending time with my mum and what other people think is not going to change that, or change what Iaposm posting either. I have people who follow me and they chat to me daily and say they like seeing the content so I wonapost let this stop me.

The shooting happened in a car leased by Dean through the NHS, the court heardPatricia Dean pictured with her son Vincenzo De Falco Image: Patricia Dean  Cavendish PressLtdByThomas MolloyChiara Fiorillo:,  Oct Updated:,  Oct | commentsA mum who took her Mercedes to a car wash after her son shot a love rival on the back seat of the vehicle has been jailed. Patricia Dean, , was sentenced to  months in prison after being found guilty of assisting an offender. Prosecution barrister Philip Barnes said the womanaposs son, Vincenzo De Falco, shot his victim while parked up in Rochdale, Greater Manchester, on January , .The court heard the car where the shooting took place was leased by Dean through the NHS and she allowed her son to drive it as and when he needed it, the Manchester Evening News reports.De Falcoaposs victim was previously in a relationship with his girlfriend Lucy Flux and the pair had been texting over the New Year period, the court heard. On the afternoon of the shooting, the victim had travelled to buy some cannabis from De Falco. When the pair met, De Falco confronted the victim about his contact with Ms Flux and allegedly shouted: “You think I’m some sort of muppet.” The victim reassured De Falco that he was just friends with Ms Flux and that there was nothing to worry about. However, the court heard De Falco then said “You want to get shot” and the victim noticed a shotgun pointed towards him. He grabbed the barrel of the gun to turn it away from him and shortly after, De Falco told another man to let the victim out of the car. As he shuffled across the back seat to leave, De Falco shot the victim in the leg at point-blank range, the court heard. The man was then dumped out of the car onto the pavement where passers-by called an ambulance. After the attack, the victim had to have his leg amputated below the knee, Bolton Crown Court heard.  De Falco, who admitted causing grievous bodily harm with intent, will be sentenced at a later date. Mental health nurse Dean had been working at North Manchester General Hospital on the day of the shooting and had only recently arrived back at her home in Sowerby Bridge, Yorkshire, when she received a call from Ms Flux. Dean immediately left her house to drive to Ms Flux’s home in Bacup, Lancashire, in her other car - a BMW. They spent around  minutes at the house before Ms Flux and Dean left in one car, while De Falco and a man left in another. Later that night, De Falco and Dean both drove along the same route in separate cars while communicating on the phone.  The next day, Dean took the Mercedes to a hand car wash in Heywood where three car wash employees spent more than an hour cleaning the Mercedes. The following day police stopped Deanaposs BMW in Middleton, North Manchester. De Falco was also in the car and both were arrested. When the Mercedes was inspected, traces of the victim’s blood were found on the door and mat, the court heard. During her interview, Dean denied knowing anything about what De Falco had done.  She told police that the car had not been washed since the weekend before the shooting but her trip to the car wash in Heywood was caught on CCTV. Defending, William Donnelly told the court that Dean was a woman of impeccable character. She worked as a nurse for more than  years and former colleagues described her as committed, honest, caring, reliable, and compassionate in character references heard by the court. Mr Donnelly said that Dean had continued to work as a nurse while on bail during the pandemic but recently found out that she has lost her job and will lose her pension too. Jailing her, Judge Tom Gilbart said: “It is absolutely mystying that a woman with such a history of care and public service would throw it all away in such a manner. “It really is such a waste to see you in the dock of a court. “You’ve continued to deny the offence in discussing matters with the probation service. “You told the author of the report, ‘I cannot be sorry for what I have been convicted of because I didn’t do it’.” Comment MORE ON Court caseCrown courtCrime\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

I think names are cyclical and itaposs gone out of fashion. A lot of people donapost like the name but I think we can make it popular again.  Nigel, who runs the pub with partner Tash, , believes one of the reasons the name has become so unpopular is down to ex-UKIP leader Nigel Farage.

As she approaches her Platinum Jubilee, the monarch has been on sparkling form in recent monthsThe Queen turned down an honour from The Oldie of the Year Awards Image: Getty ImagesByRussell MyersRoyal editorChiara Fiorillo:,  Oct | commentsThe Queen has “politely but firmly” turned down an honour from The Oldie of the Year Awards because she “didn’t believe she met the relevant criteria” to accept. The -year-old monarch graciously declined the award, stating that “you are only as old as you feel”. Author and broadcaster Gyles Brandreth, chairman of the awards, wrote to her private secretary Sir Edward Young to askshe would accept the main Oldie of the Year. But in a letter published in the November issue of the magazine, her assistant private secretary Tom Laing-Baker wrote: “Her Majesty believes you are as old as you feel, as such The Queen does not believe she meets the relevant criteria to be able to accept and hopes you will find a more worthy recipient.” As she approaches her Platinum Jubilee next year, the Queen has been on sparkling form in recent months, entertaining world leaders, attending the races and mastering the very modern ritual of the video call. This year, her daughter-in-law the Duchess of Cornwall has joined Gyles Brandreth for the publication’s first in-person awards ceremony since  at The Savoy Hotel in London. For the past  years, The Oldie of The Year Awards has celebrated the achievements of those of the older generation who have made a special contribution to public le. Previous winners have included everyone from Oscar winners to Nobel laureates, from community care nurses to veteran athletes, from Sir John Major to Dame Olivia de Havilland and David Hockney. Last year, the principal Oldie of the Year award went to Petula Clark, whose eight-decade career in showbusiness skyrocketed during the Blitz.It comes after reports that the Queen was annoyed that planet-polluting leaders may skip a UN climate summit.Her Majesty will attend the COP in Glasgow with Princes Charles and William, who says son George worries about litter. She said of world leaders such as Russia’s President Putin failing to commit: “It’s irritating.” The leaders of countries including China and Russia have been dubbed “irritating” by the Queen for failing to commit to next month’s UN climate change conference. The monarch, , spoke of her dismay just weeks before global heads of state and environmentalists including activist Greta Thunberg discuss the climate emergency at the COP in Glasgow.

It is not out of the question that we will have to ask another year group to also work from home later in the week, I will let you knowthis needs to be the case, she added.  The letter states: As recent communication has indicated, the number of COVID cases in the academy has increased recently and this has affected both staff and students. For the first time in the pandemic we are really struggling with staffing levels. Over the last week or so we have had to call on a number of supply teachers but even that is not going to be enough for the rest of this week. Therefore we have made the very dficult decision to move Year  students to online learning from tomorrow for the rest of the week. Year  have made a great start to the year and we know they will work very hard independently. We are also conscious that we do not want to create childcare issues for parents and that is why we have chosen Year .

As mentioned in my message yesterday,you can continue to encourage your child to complete daily lateral flow tests then that will help to pick up asymptomatic positive cases. A number of other schools have also reintroduced face masks this month.

Last Monday, Zara Owen, , from Surrey who is a student at the University of Nottingham was on a night out at Pryzm, Nottingham, with her friends. Upon entering the club and going through security, she went to get a drink from the bar, but that is where her memories of that night end. The next thing she remembers is waking up the next morning without any recollection of what had happened after the entered the club, something that had never happened to her before. Speaking to the Mirror, Zara said: I was originally really confused because I woke up with no memory of the night. That is something that never happens to me and it was confusing since I hadnapost drank much alcohol. When it hit me I had been spiked, I was so shocked to realise this had happened to me as I take the safety measures given very seriously. I cover my glasses and I cover my bottles to make sure nothing goes in, but to realise I had been injected is terrying. She says that nothing was out of the ordinary at first, but she had woken up with a sharp, agonising pain in her leg and was walking with a limp. After speaking to her friends, they informed her that she had been acting out of character, not making any sense and wandering off alone. Thankfully, a friend was able to get her home safely after spotting her outside the club where she had walked off and was speaking incoherently. The next morning, she was shocked to find a pin-prick after examining her leg properly. I had been spiked, she wrote in a post on Twitter.Zara went to the hospital to have her leg checked out, but was left waiting for hours. Sharing her experience, she said: Obviously with needles, you can catch HIV or hepatitis.  I went to the hospital and I had triage and was asked some background questions. That was it, I sat waiting and assumed Iaposd be seen. After sitting in AE for eight hours, she gave up and went home as she had an early start and she had been there all night. I rang my GP the next day and explained what happened, but they could only give me an appointment for two weeks time. I called up the phlebotomy who said you need to have paperwork to be checked. I canapost get paperworkno-one will see me. By the time I will see the GP it will be two weeks. If I am carrying anything it will be too late.  Zara decided to inform the police a few days after what happened. I spoke to the police on Saturday after work and they came to my house that night for a statement, she said. They recorded everything and said theyaposd take a urine sample, but they texted me the next day to say I didnapost need to hand it in as it had been too long. Obviously, itaposs going to be hard to find out who the culprit was. When asking her about what she thinks should be done to tackle incidences of spiking in clubs and bars, Zara highlighted the need to have competent and thorough security staff and measures. She told the Mirror: For me it comes down to security. More security in checking - Iaposve been to clubs before and I havenapost been searched. Itaposs so beneficial and people shouldnapost be able to bring in these substances and the security should check. She also highlighted the need for security to ensure they are actively monitoring the crowd and looking out for any behaviour that can cause harm to women. Zara explained that going forward, she will naturally be more aware of her surroundings. She added: One of my main fears is being spiked, or my friends being spiked on a night out. Thataposs always been there. Now itaposs happened to me, itaposs much stronger in my mind. Iaposll be more aware and make sure [my friends] are all okay. Iaposm lucky enough that Iaposm fine and didnapost end up in hospital or worse. The fear factor is still there but I would like to think that I can go out and measures will be in place so I can have a stress free evening. I donapost know what weaposre supposed to do.  Unfortunately, Zara is not the only person to have been spiked through an injection.Leeds Studentsapos Group, which is a student Facebook page that has over  thousand members across all of Leedsapos universities, has had a number of people warning that women had been injected.Students posted about feeling sharp pinches and later finding pin-pricks on their bodies while on nights out. There were reports of this happening in nightclubs that are popular among students, such as Beaver Works, Mint, TenBar and O Academy Leeds. Speaking to the Mirror about her experience at an event at O Academy Leeds, one woman said: I was in a large crowd and I felt something sharp go into my thigh. About five people were trying to squeeze past my group at that point so I didnapost really think much of it as I thought one of them had accidentally scratched me.  I was fine the whole night but when I got home my thigh ached and had a needle puncture in it and bruising. [Iaposm] guessing someone tried to spike me but it didnapost work. It was definitely an IM injection like an epi-pen.It made me feel sick that this this is what people are resorting to. God knows what they want to do to these young women but I don’t want to think about it! Bars and clubs need to do thorough checks of pockets and bags on doors and high quality security cameras around the place to deter this sort of behaviour.Ellie Patrick, , from London had her drink spiked while at Walkabout in Leeds, which caused her to have a fall on her shoulder and knees. Speaking on how the incident impacted her, she told the Mirror: The next day I was extremely sick and unwell all day. I had a bad headache and was hot and cold.I went to the hospital that evening just to seeI was okay. Unfortunately, I never got in touch with anyone about this experience because it scared me quite a bit and I just wanted to put it behind me.I had also heard about previous experiences of people being spiked at Walkabout and the venue not doing anything to help the situation.I also did not inform the police as I wasn’t surethey’d take the case seriously since I had no evidence I was spiked.So sadly thereaposs no follow up, I do wish I had done something about it. A University of Nottingham spokesperson said: “The University and Students’ Union are concerned by these reports and are working closely with Nottinghamshire Police and the city’s nightle venues.We would encourage our students to be additionally vigilant and follow police advice to report any suspicions to them immediately for investigationStudent welfare is our top priority and we already run a range of schemes to support students’ personal safety when on a night out. Detective Superintendent Paula Bickerdike, of West Yorkshire Police’s Safeguarding Central Governance Unit, said: “We understand the genuine concerns that women have around their safety, particularly in the night-time economy, and we remain absolutely committed to doing everything we can alongside our partner agencies to make the county a safer place for women and girls. “We continue to work alongside partner agencies and licensees to warn and educate people about staying safe on a night out, and we conduct regular partnership operations to keep people safe.” The West Yorkshire Police added: [We] have received one report of ‘spiking by injection’, reported to have occurred in Leeds city centre on October , . We have spoken to the victim about this matter and enquiries are currently ongoing into the incident. What to doyou suspect you have been injected or spiked: The NHS website provides some guidelines on what to doyour skin has been punctured with a used needle. They advise to aposwash the wound using running water and plenty of soapapos, aposdry the wound and cover it with a waterproof plaster or dressingapos and to not scrub the wound or suck any blood. Nottingham Policeaposs websites has some guidance on what to doyour drink has been spiked, but they currently do not have any guidelines on being injected. They advise to: Tell the people you’re with and make sure you’re someone where you feel safe. Alert a member of staff at the pub or club you are at. If you feel unwell you should seek medical attention immediately and tell them that you believe your drink has been spiked. Girls Against, a non-profit organisation that campaigns against sexual assault at music events, has provided some tips for venues.  Speaking to the Mirror, it said: Our main piece of advice to venues is to train all venue staff on how to appropriately and efficiently handle such situations - what signs to be aware of [and] what medical advice to be aware of. No one who has been spiked via injection or otherwise should be made to feel guilty or asthe event was their fault. West Yorkshire Police and Nottingham Police have been contacted for comment.

While eight in  are adamant a dollop of tomato sauce on the side of the plate to dip food in to is best, two in  prefer to smother their meal. More than half felt squirting ketchup all over a dish was bad manners and an insult to the chef. The survey of , adults by frozen food giant Birds Eye found chips were the most popular food to go with a condiment, with dippers second and nachos third. But dipping food into someone ’s sauce was seen as a faux pax by half while ketchup or mayo with a roast was a no-no for almost  per cent. And four in  fussy eaters frowned on mixing two sauces together on a plate. Ketchup was crowned king of the condiments, followed by mayonnaise barbecue and chilli sauce.  Annalisa Fanali, marketing manager for Chicken Dippers at Birds Eye, said: “Our research shows just how important a dip or a sauce is, with many saying that a meal is simply not complete without a condiment. “We weren’t surprised to see that ketchup still reigns supreme when it comes to our favourite thing to dip or dunk our food into.” Birds Eye, who commissioned the survey are on the hunt for a new CDO, a Chief Dipping Officer. The position requires an inidual with outstanding taste buds and has a solid background in sauce ratios.  The chosen candidate will receive a year’s supply of Birds Eye Chicken Dippers, £, in cash and will be required to oversee the Birds Eye social media channels. A spokesperson for Birds Eye said, “We’re really excited to be on the hunt for our new Chief Dipping Officer and we’re looking forward to seeing what hopefuls think they can bring to the job, as well as providing some expert dipping tips to share with the nation.” Top :  Ketchup  Mayonnaise  BBQ sauce  Chilli sauce  Salsa  Brown sauce  Salad cream  Guacamole  Soy sauce  Mustard Comment MORE ON Birds EyeFoodCelebrity kids\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Did you notice a red sky this morning  Here’s what it really meansA stunning ed sky over Blyth, Northumberland Image: PAByMalvika Padin:,  Oct Updated:,  Oct | commentsWinter mornings are hard, the pitch-black sky making it dficult to wake up and start your day. But when the sun finally comes up, have you noticed that the sky is often tinged pink or red If you’ve ever heard some iation of the ‘shepherd’s warning’ rhyme, this may be the first thing that pops into your head. If you havenapost this is how it goes – ‘Red sky at night – shepherd’s’ delight  Red sky in the morning – shepherd’s take warning.’But what does a red sky really mean  Why does it happen  And does it actually impact the weather  If you’ve ever asked any of these questions, then here are all the answers you’re looking for.Why does the sky turn red in the morning  Periods of high pressure during winter can lead to cold, dry days, with light winds. These winds cause dust and other particles to become trapped within the atmosphere.This means that when the sunlight moves through the sky, the red waves pass through the air more easily than blue ones tend to deflect and get scattered, leaving the sky tinged red.Did you have a stunning red sky this morning  Let us know in the comments belowSometimes, when the red light is reflected on white clouds it gives the appearance of pink clouds as well. What does the ‘shepherd’s warning’ rhyme have to do with the red sky  For over  years, shepherd’srhyme – which also appears in the Bible - has been used as a rule of thumb for predicting the weather. The aposshepherd’s warningapos means that the weather following a day with a red sky was going to be poor – something which shepherds and sailors both had reason to be wary of.Is the ‘shepherd’s warning’ rhyme true  Despite the science behind the red sky, the ‘shepherd’s warning’ rhyme does hold some truth to it as well, as long as you’re somewhere along the middle latitudes of the planet. In the UK, weather systems move predominantly from west to east. A red sky in the morning therefore means that the sky is clear to the east, where the sun is rising, but cloudy overhead. This suggests that the clouds are beginning to move in bringing in bad weather with it. Meanwhile, a red sky at sunset means high pressure is moving in from the west and therefore the next day will usually be dry and pleasant. However, in the tropics, where the winds blow in the opposite direction, the saying about red skies doesn’t work.

Posting on TikTok under the username @keylamxo, the woman said the family managed to rack up a bill of in food and shots of tequila.She explained in the video: “This girl I went to high school with came in with her family to celebrate her dad’s birthday.

The woman added: “When the mum asked for the cheque, she was like, ‘If you would have told me the tab was this high, maybe you would have gotten a tip’. “Like ma’am, I just work here! I’m not pocket watching, I do not know how much is in your bank account. “Maybe you shouldn’t go out to eatyou can’t f***ing afford to.” To make matters worse, the family then chose to completely wreck their table and cause a mess, leaving the waitress to clear it up without a penny in tips. She said: “So this woman decides to spray ketchup all over the table and knock over all the drinks before she leaves and tipped me nothing. And that’s why I cried.”  In the video, the woman also shared a picture of the family’s receipt, which showed the  order alongside a  in the tips box. The family had also written “F*** you” where the signature was supposed to be and drew a picture of a hand with its middle finger up. The TikTok video sparked a debate on the topic in the comments, with people split over whether tipping should be mandatory. One person wrote: “I can afford to eat out every day of the week. What I canapost afford to do is pay for my server to live. Itaposs the restaurantaposs job.” While another disagreed, posting: “Iaposm literally appalled and have lost faith in the disgusting amount of people saying they donapost think they should have to tip.

It’s your job and you chose that line of work.” And a fourth commented: “Servers are not paid a liveable wage, not even minimum wage for that matter.

The display was so gory it prompted several passersby to call the police after thinking they’d stumbled across an actual crime scene. And even though he was visited by officers multiple times last year, Steven has vowed to put his decorations up once again at his home in Dallas, Texas – especially in light of the “rough” year many have faced.Speaking to the Dallas Observer, he said: “This year has been rough for a lot of people. I think we can agree that this project is ing as a pressure release valve.” Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. Steven is even encouraging police to turn up to his house again this year. He added: “All the cops that came out last year were an absolute gas. I welcome them to come out and take more selfies.” The artist has said many of the fan-favourite decorations from last year will be make a reappearance in his upcoming display – but there will be plenty of new details on display too. He explained: “Last year’s hits remain: the safe, ladder, chainsaw, Roof Guy and my girlfriend. Also the fake blood made of corn syrup on the sidewalk.  “But there are lots of new details -gallon drums are now out by the curb filled up with the shredded party [of guests]. And I made the body parts this year by cutting up mannequins then filling them with skeleton parts and Great Stuff insulation foam.” The centrepiece of his display this year is a refurbished wood chipper that spits out fake blood across his lawn and into a paddling pool covered in shredded mannequin remains. He said of the new addition: “There are lots of new gimmicks to this year’s caper. The wood chipper blood fountain being the clear centrepiece and easily the most challenging prop. It took me months to find an old wood chipper for sale. The sellers were not pleased with its new purpose.” And Steven is even being conscious about the environment with his display, as the woodchipper and fountain are set up in a way that doesn’t waste water.  He added: “It’s all powered by a submersible water pump inside the [kiddie] pool which then leads back to the wood chipper fountain. You can turn that pump on with your foot by pressing a hidden pedal switch.” If that wasn’t enough to ensure the artist wins all the awards for best Halloween display, he’s also created an optical illusion with a second front door that makes it look like his house has been broken into by an axe-wielding maniac. He said: “I bought a door, matched the house paint, smashed it, and mounted it to swing out on hinges. “The real door to my house behind it, I then painted with a product called Black . that reflects very little light, so it almost looks invisible.” Steven has spent a small fortune on his gory display this year, and is welcoming donations through his Venmo account, @stevenallennovak. And despite the time and money it takes to set up the impressive scene, Steven is determined to go even bigger next year. He said: “It’s been a tremendous amount of work and dough, but it’s worth it because people love it so much. People get as tickled looking at my massacre as they do looking at puppies!

This basset hound, named Lincoln Monster, has been taking full advantage of his natural talents and using his own ear as something to chew on. The video, which was uploaded by TikTok user @lincolnmonster, was a huge success on the app, with over . million views and more than , likes. At the beginning of the hilarious sequence, Lincoln’s owner notices that he has decided his long ear will make a perfect chew toy.  She quickly tells her dog to let go and stop chewing on it, but to no avail, as Lincoln masterfully evades her and continues to clasp his ear in his jaw. Lincoln’s owner struggles throughout the clip, attempting to reason with her dog and convince him to let go of his ear, both through words and force. However, as the video’s caption explains, it’s tricky to take away the thing your dog is chewing on when it is attached to their head. By the end of the video, she still has not been able to pry Lincoln’s ear from his jaw, with the dog showing off his perseverance. Viewers could clearly relate to this experience, with one user commenting: “Mine gets ponytail prison time with a scrunchy only thing I found that works.” Another commenter wrote: “Chasing tails is overrated. Catching ears is where it’s at.”  A third added: “He said no it’s mine.” Basset hounds as a breed are described by The Kennel Club as placid and affectionate, coming from an ancient lineage and possessing a deep melodious voice.

In one video the -year-old student – whose TikTok account is @Jesss.Harrisonxx – reeled off a list of questions which all had the answer “no”, including: “Do you do cash back ”, “Can I push the till barrier open ”, “Can I see the manager ”, and the infamous “Can you seeyou have any more in the back ”.

But Jessica, who worked at Home Bargains for four months throughout the Easter period this year, also lted the lid on some money-saving secrets – including when the best time to shop is. According to Jessica, you can bag better dealsyou shop at the end of the season, as items will be reduced to help get rid of leftover stock. She said: “So just after Christmas is your best time to grab bits for the following year!  “I worked throughout the Easter period and when Easter was over, all of the decorations were drastically reduced in price.”Outside of items being reduced, Jessica – who also shared tips on her Instagram account – says it’s pretty hard to get a discount in store.She explained: “Discounts are only given when there is something wrong with the item, for examplethere is a piece missing or something could be broken. “They are quite strict with when discounts are given, and the shop floor staff always have to ask a manager before telling a customer they can have something at a reduced rate. “ And the former employee also has the best tip for tracking down an item that just isn’t available in your local store. Jessica said you can ask management to ring nearby stores to seethey have the product in stock – andthey do, they can put it aside for you so that no-one  pinches it while you make your way to the other shop.Most ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Shopping adviceTikTok\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our money-saving tips and top offers direct to your inbox with the Mirror Money newsletterInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Richard Jenkins has been warned he faces police actionhe doesnapost chop down his ft hedge - which has been carved into a hand flipping the middle finger. The -year-old was stunned when council chiefs ordered it to tear it down after displaying the rude topiary for the last  years. He initially carved it as a joke for punters who teased him as he cut the hedges at a pub opposite his home in the village of Warton, Warks.  Get the news you want straight to your inbox. for a Mirror newsletter here The middle-finger bush now attracts a younger crowd too - with Instagram and TikTok fans desperate to share it on social media.So Richard, who has two grown-up children and four grandchildren, was baffled when he learnt the authorities wanted it removed. It follows a complaint from a resident living nearby which prompted Warwickshire County Council to write to him threatening legal action.  But Richard has remained defiant and locals who love the hedge have even launched a ‘Save the Warton Bush’ campaign. He said: It all started years ago as a bit of a laugh with the locals in the nearby pub. I used to do the hedges over there and they’d give me a bit of a tease when they came out. “One day I thought I’d get my own back so cut the hedge into a giant middle finger. The pub locals thought it was hilarious and it just went from there. It became a permanent fixture in the village.  “Everything was fine until I got a letter from the council saying someone had complained, saying the hedge was obscene. “I was told I’d have to cut it down or mody it so it didn’t look rude anymore. I refused so they got the police involved. A policeman came out and saidthey received any more complaints then I’d be instantly fined.“He even suggested I turn it into a fist but I told him no way. I still didn’t do anything about the hedge apart from let it grow out a bit but there’s no way I’d chop it down. “It was all for a laugh.” Richard and his we of  years, Linda, , live opposite The Office Pub in the village with the hedge pointing towards the entrance. He added: Many people quite like it, often you see you people stopping in their cars, getting out and having a picture with it. One local lad even has it as his screensaver on his phone. I have had it up for nearly  years now, it is staying. Warwickshire Police confirmed an officer was sent to investigate although they had not received a direct complaint.

Midas, who is from Chicago in the USA, loves to relax and unwind in the bathroom like many of us do, but his clever twist is that he rests on the bath, not in it.The video, which comes from TikTok user @saint.in.the.city, shows off Midas’ favourite place to relax, right on the edge of the bathtub.The short clip has been viewed about , times and has more than , likes on the video sharing  TikTok. This ingenious idea stems from the fact that there is an air vent in the bathroom, which cools both the tiles and,he can get his positioning right, his head at the same time.   The huge dog’s owner is clearly amused by his awkward pose as he rests his head on the edge of the bath, repeatedly chuckling throughout the video and asking Midashe is comfortable. Viewers were clearly amused by the St Bernard’s unusual hangout spot, with one user commenting: “I’m so confused by the scale of all of this.” Another equally perplexed dog owner wrote: “I have super expensive dog beds for my big boy, yet he sleeps on the hard tile most of the time because it’s cool.” A third added: “My Max does this!

Posting on Mumsnet, the woman explained she often wears brooches to work and had recently bought a dazzling rhinestone spider brooch, which she wore for the first time last week. And just a few hours into her sht, the woman was approached by her manager and asked to take off her accessory – because it was terrying one of her colleagues who has a phobia of spiders.She explained: “I quite often wear brooches and yesterday wore a new one to work. It is from Zara and is a reasonably large sparkly rhinestone spider, which I had pinned to a black jumper.  Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. “Mid-morning my line manager approached and askedI would be prepared to take the brooch off as a colleague had said that they have a phobia and was finding it distressing. “I took it off my jumper and put it on my coat, which I didnapost wear again until I left for the day.” The woman doesn’t know who the complaint came from, but insisted she’s never heard of any of her colleagues suffering from arachnophobia before now. She added: “The complaint will have come from one of three people, based on who saw me yesterday morning.  “Iaposm not going to go digging to find out who it was, and I donapost want to cause anyone distressbut Iaposve worked with all three of them for several years and this severe phobia has never come up before. “I donapost want to be a d*** but equally I really like my brooch.” The post has over  comments, and opinion has been ided over whether the woman should stop wearing the brooch. One person wrote: “Itaposs a brooch, not a pet tarantula. They are being ridiculous.” And another agreed, adding: “Fear of real spiders is one thing, fear of a piece of jewellery is quite another.” But several others sided with the colleague, insisting a fear of spiders doesn’t necessarily stop at the real thing. Someone said: “If someone has a real phobia of spiders, itaposs not inconceivable that they canapost even mention the word. “There are ying degrees of arachnophobia, and for some people they canapost tolerate seeing the word spider written down or seeing images . “A phobia is an irrational fear of something, so just because it doesnapost make sense to you, doesnapost make it any less traumatic for them.” While another wrote: “My colleague has a spider phobia. There is no way she could have spent the day looking at that brooch. Just knowing it was there would have been enough. “Phobias arenapost rational and go way beyond just not liking them.” And a third posted: “It would be unreasonable to wear it to work in the future now you know it causes distress to a colleague.”What do you think  Let us know in the comments.

TikTok star @my.data.not.yours uploaded a clip for her fans documenting all the information that the tech giant had collected about her. She said she put in a request but didnapost expect them to have too much, but was aposnot totally comfortableapos with what she discovered. It turned out that Amazon had her location, all her phone contacts, and thousands and thousands of recordings of her voice - collected from products that she gladly bought and placed in her home.  What do you think about the information Amazon collects  Let us know in the commentsIn the video, she said: I requested all the data that Amazon has on me, and hereaposs what I found. For reference, I have two dots and one echo, plus a few smart bulbs. She then opens a zip filed that had previously been downloaded and it contains many folders, which are titled aposAlertsapos, aposAnswersapos, aposAudio and Transitionapos, aposListsapos, aposRoutinesapos, aposShoppingapos, aposSkillsapos, and aposVideoapos, amongst others. She continued: I decided to click on the audio one and this is what they have. These are all short voice clips which is so scary and this is one of me turning on the light. There are  short audio clips in this folder alone. I then clicked on contacts and it turns out they have a full list of contacts from my phone and I never remember syncing that.

The very last thing that I didnapost know that they had, I could have assumed that they had, but I donapost love that they have, is my location. If you open up thishere it will show you where you are located, right down to the latitude and longitude. I am not totally comfortable with everything they have. The video soon had over . million views alongside , likes and over , comments - many of which were from concerned Amazon customers. One user said: The fact that you didnapost know all this is more of reflection on you than Amazon. And a second said: Itaposs scary that people with Echo Dots and Alexaaposs etc donapost know that Amazon records you and keeps the recordings. While a third joked: Can someone explain to me why this is aposscaryapos  Iaposm not interesting enough to carethey have my contacts or audio. A spokesperson for Amazon said: We give customers transparency and control over their Alexa experience. Customers can easily review and delete their voice recordings, or choose not to have them saved at all, at any time.Customers can import their mobile phone contacts to the Alexa app so they can use features like hands-free calling and messaging this optional feature, which customers need to set up, can be disabled at any time.Finally, you can grant permissions for the Alexa app to use certain data, such as your mobile device’s geolocation, to provide relevant results weather, traffic, restaurant recommendations, and you can manage these permissions in the app. Do you have a story to share  Weaposd love to hear all about it.

She is not pregnant, that bump don’t grow, one wrote, while another added: Stop faking your pregnancy. Another troll added: I reckon sheaposs just bloated. For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. Fortunately not everyone was quite so rude about Sofiaaposs smaller bump, with others joking about how their stomachs look similar after eating a big meal. Honestly, same. You look amazing but  months is what I look like after dinner today, one TikTok user commented, while another added: Aww your tummy is so small itaposs adorable. Meanwhile, a third wrote: This makes me feel so much better, I didnapost start showing until I was around  months. You honestly have the cutest bump Iaposve ever seen, another added. Eventually, after Sofiaaposs daughter was born, the mum-of-one decided to get her own back on the cruel trolls, by sharing their comments about fake pregnancies alongside clips of her playing with her beautul baby girl. Regardless of the size of her bump, Sofiaaposs daughter was born happy, healthy and adorable. That certainly is one way to prove that the haters were wrong.Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

Tens of thousands of dissidents and political prisoners are reportedly harvested in China every year as part of a barbaric black market operation led by the Chinese governmentA Falun Gong follower displays torture methods they claim Chinese authorities used against their members in China Image: ReutersByAlex BellottiNews Features Writer:,  Oct | commentsCalled to a remote hillside on a hot summeraposs day, Dr Enver Tothi felt a chill down his spine as gunshots rang out across the fields. Walking his team over the summit, the medical expert was greeted by the sight of up to  men wearing prisonersapos unorms collapsed leless on the ground. Their heads had been blown off by military police who stood over twitching corpses - the job of Dr Tothi was to harvest fresh organs, which have become a valuable commodity on the Chinese black market. The horric scenes may sound eerily similarly to the side plot in Netflixaposs smash hit drama Squid Game, but the gruesome practice is all too real.Human rights groups in China claim the government is operating an organ-trafficking network that harvests as many as , dissidents and political prisoners every year.Hearts, kidneys, livers and even corneas are all removed on an industrial scale, campaigners say - while those involved have revealed grim secrets of witnessing the barbaric scenes first-hand. Organs aposharvestedapos like in Netflix hit Since its release last month, Squid Game has quickly become the most-viewed international show in Netflixaposs history. The creepy South Korean thriller sees desperate contestants battle it out in childhood-inspired games to win millions of pounds - the catch being thatthey fail, they die. Get the biggest news delivered to your inbox.for the Mirroraposs free newslettersWhile the far-fetched premise thankfully isnapost inspired by real le, a side plot sees workers for the aposgameapos dragging off injured participants to harvest their organs and sell them off. Just months before the showaposs release, UN human rights experts warned they were extremely alarmed by reports of alleged organ harvesting in real le. Minorities including followers of the religious movement Falun Gong, Uyghurs, Tibetans, Muslims and Christians are being targeted in detention in China, the reports claim. The UN experts say they have received credible information that detainees are being mysteriously subjected to blood tests and organ examinations such as ultrasound and x-rays - without consent. “Forced organ harvesting in China appears to be targeting specic ethnic, linguistic or religious minorities held in detention, often without being explained the reasons for arrest or given arrest warrants, at dferent locations,” they said. “We are deeply concerned by reports of discriminatory treatment of the prisoners or detainees based on their ethnicity and religion or belief. “According to the allegations received, the most common organs removed from the prisoners are reportedly hearts, kidneys, livers, corneas and, less commonly, parts of livers. This form of trafficking with a medical nature allegedly involves health sector professionals, including surgeons, anaesthetists and other medical specialists.”  China is facing a huge shortage of organs that can be used for transplants, but under controversial rules recipients can book surgeries for specic dates and locations. This doesnapost happen in other countriesapos systems, as surgeons cannot predict when a potential donor will die. Under Chinaaposs rules, the donoraposs organs will be sent to the most urgent patient on a waiting list who is within travelling distance. This has allowed the country to establish a horric aposkill to orderapos system, but despite widespread condemnation, Beijing has been able to cover it up by under-reporting transplant figures to the World Health Organisation.A recent statistical analysis of Chinaaposs current organ transplant system showed the numbers China has been putting out have been falsied, Susie Hughes, executive director of The International Coalition to End Transplant Abuse in China, told Daily Mail Australia.When you examine hospital revenues, bed utilisation rates and the number of surgical teams from the official Chinese data... the figure is more likely to be between , to , transplants per year. aposI became a robot... you carry out what you are programmed toapos China has persecuted a number of minority groups over the years, with thousands of Falun Gong detained as religious prisoners around the turn of the century. In , human rights lawyers began campaigning on the issue of organ harvesting, but  years later, little has been done to curb the sickening practice.  While the Falun Gong were once the target of the authorities, following its effective dissolution as a movement the Uighur - an ethnic group of Muslims now largely situated in the north-west of China - became the new scapegoat.Last year, the China Tribunal published a landmark  page report after  months of investigation into organ harvesting in the country. Dr Tothi - who now works as a London Uber driver - contributed to the enquiry, having been forced to remove a prisoners organs while working as a doctor in .I became a robot, the father-of-three told MirrorOnline. You carry out what you are programmed to do. When I cut through there was bleeding, which means the heart was still beating. I understood why. This man was shot to the right chest. They knocked him out but did not let him die immediately so I had time to remove the organs.  It was an easy and quick operation which took  to  minutes. Even less because it’s a destructive operation. The chief surgeon put the organs in a box and said aposnow you take your team back to hospital, and today nothing happenedapos. When Dr Tothi was made to carry out the brutal surgery, the Chinese Communist Party was concerned with the Falun Gong - a religious group that top brass considered to be a grave threat to their authority. The identity of the man he was forced to operate on, without anesthetic, remains a mystery to him. Prisoner x-rayed at horric concentration camp Tens of thousands of Falun Gong prisoners of conscience are thought to have been killed so that their organs could be sold in the lucrative black market.Among the lucky survivors was Jenner Zeng, who was saved from having her innards plundered by a chance admission to a prison guard. For  hours a day the mum-of-one was forced to stand in the sun and recite regulations at a prison camp in Beijing until she fainted, at which point a guard would shock her awake with an electric batton. Itaposs very sad, because we failed to stop them when they did this to Falun Gong, Ms Zeng toldof the state-run programme of forced organ harvesting. The western world funded this persecution by investing in China. Thenow has the power to expand this mass murder to Uighur and the people of Hong Kong. During her time in the camp Ms Zeng was taken to a medical facility where she had her eyes tested and her organs touched. She explained to the doctor that she had been infected with hepatitis C during a blood transfusion after giving birth, but had been cured of it in the process of practising Falun Gong. A month later she and several thousand inmates were taken in shackles in large buses with their windows blacked out to a hospital where they were x-rayed. At a smaller clinic back at the camp their blood was taken without explanation. It was only after her release that Ms Zeng learned that the authorities had been removing the organs of prisoners to be sold to wealthy and powerful people, from China and from overseas. Only at that stage, I realised what a narrow escape I had, she explained.  If I had not told the doctor I had had hepatitis C, I could have become a victim as well. From my first dayI had a strange feeling. Is this real  Have I been sent to the concentration camps in the history books  Could this be happening in the st century  We read about it in the history books but it doesnapost happen anymore. I had been transferred to the Nazi concentration camps. That kind of feeling haunted me for a long time. aposMy name is the butcher... itaposs like slaughtering pigsapos Also included in the  report is a transcript of a telephone call between an investigator and Zhu Jiabin, who admits to murdering and harvesting the organs of Gao Yixi in . Asked about the harvesting, Jiabin says: Sold them!’ After slaughtering and opening up the belly, you just carve out the organs and sell them. I only know to sell organs for money after organ harvesting. That is my principle... If you had guts to stand in front of me now I would live organ harvest you... My name is ‘the butcher’... I am called the butcher specialising in live organ harvesting... Itaposs nothing, just like slaughtering pigs. You come over to shave their hair first and then split open the belly. I would carve out whatever I need. After scooping the organs out, I would sell them.Last year, a group of doctors were found to have harvested the organs of car crash victims and then sold them for cash.Six people, including four doctors, were jailed in China having been caught up in the countryaposs thriving organ black market. It followed growing reports that the country was executing Muslim prisoners and taking their organs to treat patients dying of Covid-. Concerns were raised after Beijing boasted about a successful double transplant operation on a patient given just days to live. Human rights groups questioned how the -year-oldaposs two matched lungs were found in a matter of days.Got a story  Get in touch by emailing alex.bellotti@reachplcComment MORE ON Squid GameNetflixChinese Communist PartyFalun Gong\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

A second “unstoppable” river of lava is burning its way through land and houses on the Canary Island of La Palma. Scientists have warned that this will “very likely” cause more explosions and gas clouds.Only an hour ago, the Canary Islands Volcano Institute published a terrying video on its Twitter site , showing the lava moving slowly and relentlessly forward.The tweet read: At : Canarian time lava flows keep moving unstoppable and the LP- over the remnants of the industrial park access.  The institute posted dramatic pictures of the volcanic eruption at night, saying: Breathtaking view of the eruption at : Canarian time in the vicinity of Tacande. It has been one month since the initial eruption in the Cumbre Vieja mountains. Since then, , buildings have been destroyed and  have been partially damaged or are in danger from the lava. Businesses and farms have also been affected as banana, vine and avocado crops have been wiped out.  Some of the plumes erupting from the volcanoes have reached as high as , metres. Around , people have been evacuated due to the ongoing lava flows. Involcan spokesman David Calvo said the eruption of the volcano was still very strong and the second river of lava would reach the sea this afternoon. Lava emitted last night had joined the river of lava and sped it up with it being only  metres from the clfs in Tazacorte a few hours ago.  Mr. Calvo said there would almost certainly be more evictions because of the potential danger. He also predicted the eruption would continue for some time as about , tons of sulfur dioxide were recorded on Monday, and for the eruption to begin to be dead,  tons or less must be registered. Last night, the Canary government said it was monitoring the situation, particularly with regard to further evictions. Due to unfavourable conditions effecting air quality, the population of El Paso has been advised to stay indoors where possible. Some areas were left without electricity because the magma flow has brought down power lines but emergency generators have now been brought in.  The whole of the island of La Palma is still registering underground quakes, the biggest of which has been . on the Richter scale. There is also a further warning that the operation of La Palma airport could be affected. In the meantime, arrangements are being made for the imminent rescue of up to six dogs trapped by the lava. Rescuers intend to use drones carrying wire baskets and are just waiting for permission to start. If successful, it would be the first rescue of its kind in the country.

We are exceptionally grateful for their continued support and determined to repay that commitment on the pitch whist working closely with them in the wider Borders community.ldquoDuring lockdown we were able to continue to offer rugby activities for the younger children, and during April we were able to support a new Try It Out campaign aimed at children that wouldnrsquot typically have access to rugby or sporting activities because of social or economic barriers. We feel very strongly that the ability to pay shouldnrsquot prevent access to sport.ldquoParents and carers were offered the option to pay what they could, or in some cases nothing at all. Over  boys and girls joined in the fun sessions at the Melrose pitches, and the majority registered to stay on until the end of the summer season. The lting of restrictions has allowed the Southern Knights to launch their buddy scheme aligning some of their semi-professional players to the younger players to help encourage and develop their skills and to inspire children to play to the best of their ability.ldquoThis inclusive ethos is shared by CGI and the award winning Inspire Learning Programme developed in partnership with Scottish Borders Council for pupils from primary four to sixth year in high school throughout the area.ldquoThis uses iPads and an array of other tools to support learning and aims to benefit all children and teachers by raising attainment, support equity and inclusion, and to work towards preparing young people for a digital future. We are keen to continue to support these initiatives in conjunction with CGI over the coming months and years.Dominic Taddei, Chair of Southern Knights Super Board said: ldquoWe are delighted to continue to work a further term with our headline sponsor CGI. Their support through very dficult times has been phenomenal and we look forward to working with them as we get ready to approach the finals day, and to now have the ability to offer a wider audience for FOSROC Super with the fantastic news that was released by Scottish Rugby on rd June  that every Super Sunday fixture has been televised live on free-to-air television by new broadcast partner, FreeSports. The FOSROC Super finals weekend will take place on the weekend of    October, and we look forward to showcasing CGI as our headline sponsor at the finals event.The continuing partnership between CGI and the Southern Knights is not only a relationship supporting sport in the Scottish Borders but also Southern Knights players and coaches are working closely with CGI on community-based initiatives in Borders schools, delivering motivational and inspirational videos for the pupils.

zero and why does it matter Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, such as carbon dioxide, trap heat and keep the planet warm.But the more of these gases we have put into the atmosphere through activities such as burning fossil fuels to heat homes, drive cars and provide electricity for our lives, the more the planet warms.These rising temperatures drive climate change, the extreme weather, rising sea levels, heatwaves, and floods that we are already seeing increase around us.So, just as you need to turn off a tap completely to stop the level of water in a bath from continuing to rise, we need to cut emissions to zero to stop the greenhouse gas levels, and therefore temperatures, rising more to prevent more dangerous climate change.Completely stopping emissions is extremely dficult, but there are some measures, such as planting trees, which can absorb greenhouse gases from the atmosphere, the equivalent of bailing some water out of the bath to keep the water level steady eventhe tap is still running slightly.vw,vw,px, px\"Global warming and the greenhouse effect So emissions have to be cut as much as possible, and any remaining pollution, from hard-to-tackle sectors such as aviation, needs to be ldquooffset by action that absorbs carbon to have the net effect of cutting emissions to zero.To stabilise global temperature at any level, emissions must reach this ldquonet zero point eventually.Scientists say that to limit temperature rises to .C above pre-industrial levels, beyond which increasingly dangerous climate impacts will be felt, global carbon emissions must be brought down to net zero by around  with deep cuts to other greenhouse gases.And the UNrsquos Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Changehas concluded that signicant amounts of carbon dioxide removal will not just be needed for mopping up residual emissions, but for creating negative levels of emissions to bring down temperatures again after overshooting the .C level.In the UK, the Government legislated in June  that the UK must reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions by , by mandating a % cut in emissions by that date.That requires deep cuts in emissions and therefore changes in all sectors, including how we heat our homes, how we travel, our power sector, how industry uses energy and even our diets, and efforts to capture some emissions.vw,vw,px, px\"How landscapes can catch carbon The statutory advisory Climate Change Committeehas said it expects more than  million tonnes of emissions will be captured in  to offset the pollution the UK is still putting out then.Ways to do that include burning plant matter for energy and capturing and burying the carbon emissions, known as BECCS, technology that captures carbon dioxide directly from the air, expanding woodlands and restoring peatlands.Delivering net zero is not without controversy, with concerns raised about the cost.But the CCC has concluded it would cost less than % of GDP through the next  years to deliver, and would bring benefits such as cleaner air, better health and provide a jobs boost, though there is a need to ensure the costs are spread fairly.It is also controversial because some environmentalists are concerned some companies and governments think they can continue to pollute while ldquooffsetting themselves out of the crisis, instead of tackling the emissions at source.However, the CCCrsquos chief executive Chris Stark has said setting a net zero target is the right approach, and the goal has galvanised action.He said it was dferent from the UKrsquos old target of % emissions cut by  because there was no longer a % of residual pollution that organisations or sectors thought they could emit.ldquoI see real progress having set net zero as a goal, not just in government circles and in policy, but crucially in the commercial sector, he said..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Net zero: what is it and why does it

did you know the term is unique to Scotlandand Ireland Heres everything you need to know about the Scots term guising, how it dfers from trick or treating and other Scottish Halloween traditions.What does guising mean Guising derives from the word disguise, and is based on the notion that people dress up at Halloween.Children dress up and go from house to house, telling jokes and stories or singing songs in exchange for sweeties and food.The Collins dictionary defines guising as \"the practice orcustomofdisguisingoneself infancydress, often with amask, andvisitingpeoples houses, especially atHalloween\".According to folklore, children dressed up so they could venture out safely without wicked ghouls detecting them.Homeowners may leave pumpkins or decorations outside their houses to indicate they are welcoming guisers.Is guising dferent to trick or treating Yes, guising is dferent to trick or treating.Traditionally, guising requires you to tell a story or a joke or sing a song, while trick or treating simply requires going up to doors and calling \"trick or treat\".Treat usually refers to a sweetie or food item, while trick refers to thethreat ofa trick being played on homeownersthey dont offer a treat.What other Scottish Halloween traditions take place There are a few moreScottish Halloween traditions aside form guising.Before pumpkin carving became the done thing, Scots traditionally carved turnips instead and filled them with candles.Apple dookin is also a Scottish tradition people have to get apples out of a basin of water using just their mouths.Alternatively, people hold forks in their mouths and drop them from a distance in an attempt to stab an apple.Another tradition was especially for newly engaged couples the couple would each burn a nut on the fire andthe nuts burned quietly a happy union lay ahead, whilethey crackled and hissed there was more likely a turbulent future.A game that has been modernised is treacle scones - back in the day, people used to try to eat scones suspended with strings without using their hands.Nowadays, this game tends to be played using donuts."},{"url":null,"title":"black-friday-2021-black-friday-year-uk---date-time","story":"Black Friday has become a part of UK culture in recent years, with the flash sales viewed as an opportunity

The woodland is a nature reserve currently managed by the Scottish Wildle Trust.The upper path takes you to Innerwick Castle. This path is narrow in places, although quite well trodden so easy to follow.But it is sided by a steep decline into the gorge that demands you take care when walking. The castle, built in the th century, is perched dramatically atop a sandstone outcrop looking over the glen. It is picturesque now but a crumbling ruin in such a precarious condition that itrsquos not recommended to venture inside.I wrote of its history on this page over seven years ago, and will touch on it again here, but the purpose of this visit was mainly to explore the gorge below the castle, which Irsquod never managed to do.Irsquoll give a warning here too: the lower path that takes you closer to the burn, although marked, doesnrsquot seem to be maintained and is in parts very muddy and slippery. It can become an adventure rather than a woodland walk. But thatrsquos what we wanted.We were immersed in native woodland as we descended, embraced by ash and oak trees. The burn ran with some confidence through the glen, carrying the rainfall of previous days. Touches of autumn were everywhere, yet the summer canopy was still intact. It was a perfect combination.As the path heads deeper up the glen, the trunk of a massive fallen tree make it an obstacle course, but also an opportunity to sit and just take in the beauty of the place and soak up the birdsong.In those moments, it was possible to forget that we were, in fact, in a landscape dominated by agriculture and open fields. The steep sides of the gorge hide the fact that the wood is just a very narrow strip. The eye is deceived, the imagination lit and the senses lted.I was determined to make it to the water. The short scramble down to the burn from the path was a drama of mud.I know, Irsquom not selling this place so well, am I, but it was the challenge to reach the burn that made it feel so remote and wild once we got there.Then one of my kids, in between complaining about muddy shoes, said something that lit up the day for me.ldquoWow, you know, it almost feels like we are in a world of fairytale make believe, you know because we are in a wood that feels like itrsquos mysterious and magical at the same time.She summed up my feelings as I sat by the burn, listening to the water tumble over the rocks.I really wanted to walk up the burn to the point below the castle.Wersquod earlier peered down at the burn from the base of the rock on which the castle is built at least a ft-fall, I reckoned.It was far too dangerous to descend at that point, although I had wanted to it was where a Scots soldier from the castle leapt for his le in  when the castle was besieged by English hakbutters, an early kind of musketeer.He was desperate his comrades had been picked off by the gunfire, so he took the chance to escape.Miraculously, he survived the initial fall and was allowed to run to safety. Sadly, he made the fatal decision to run upstream, towards Thornton Castle, where he was seen and shot by a dferent group of English soldiers who knew nothing of his daring feat.The incident was recorded by an English eyewitness, but we have no name for the man who met his end so tragically in this gorge ndash just another nameless victim of a brutal war that became known later as the lsquoRough Wooingrsquo.Later, the castle was used as a base by moss troopers in  in their attacks on Cromwellrsquos supply route, but thatrsquos another story.The melancholy of the glenrsquos history didnrsquot diminish its beauty for me and I made my way carefully along the burn, jumping from stone to stone, getting my boots muddy and soaked in the process. It really was a magical experience in which my inner child felt free.However, I had a dferent kind of gunfire to contend with as I ventured upstream. Irsquod insisted my kids stay in a safer place and my we Kate was happy to be with them and keep her feet dry. But the children showered me with a volley of distant shouts and yells that they wanted to come too, which I felt would have been too hazardous for the youngest.So I was compelled to abandon my exploration in case they broke ranks you see, they donrsquot always do as they are told, especially when their dad is doing something they want to experience as well!But I will I can find the time in the winter, with perhaps just one of the kids: my own inner child."},{"url":null,"title":"gas-works-see-road-closures-prestonpans-13-weeks","story":"SGN announced that it would begin work to upgrade its gas network in the Prestonpans area on Monday.The work involves replacing ,m of old metal gas mains and service pipes with new plastic pipe, ensuring a continued safe and reliable gas supply to the local community.SGN has planned its work in close consultation with local authorities to reduce disruption as much as possible.The project will be carried out by SGN contractor George Ritchie  Son.During the works, parking restrictions will be in operation allowing safe access to the pipe ndash some road closures will also be required.Temporary traffic signals will be in operation at certain times, which may cause delays during peak periods.Emergency vehicle access will be maintained throughout the work.The gas work will be suspended during the Christmas holidays, with operatives ing early in the new year.Road closures include Prestongrange Terracersquos junction with Prestongrange Road, and Polwarth Terracersquos junction with Gardiner Terrace.To minimise disruption, SGN work will be carried out on a phased basis and not all streets will be affected at the same time.Access to driveways and garages will be maintained unless previously agreed with the occupier.An SGN spokesperson said: ldquoWersquoll be working as quickly as possible to complete our work and will be making every effort to minimise inconvenience to the local community.Suspension of parking is as follows:Prestonpans Community Council is calling for greater clarity on road works in and around the town, ideally in the form of an interactive map showing all the restrictions over time.A spokesperson for the community council said: ldquoInidual roadworks are obviously necessary for the maintenance of our public utilities.ldquoHowever, there is a balance to be struck between maintenance and what can quickly become a public nuisance.ldquoIf roadworks are all planned to minimise distribution, there is currently no way of telling.

Where other comedy-dramas might have a miserly handful of zingers, the multiple Emmy-winning Succession throws them around like confetti.In an ensemble as good as this, it should be dficult to choose a favourite, but who are we ******* kidding here  Brian Coxrsquos swearmaster-in-chief commands every scene he is in.Logan, one of the most fascinating TV characters in years, is a charming psychopath who long ago wearied of the charming part of the deal.He is, as cousin Greg likes to say, ldquoall killer, no filler, a man who has clawed his way out of poverty in Scotland , a modern day robber baron who thinks tough love is the only kind that will equip his children to survive in this rotten world .Courtesy of Cox, Logan can make Daniel Day-Lewisrsquos oilman in There Will Be Blood look like Santa.The third series opener could have been a stop-start affair aiming to pick up new viewers who have heard the buzz about Succession and fancy seeing what the fuss is about.That Armstrong gives it the pace of a runaway train is a promising sign that he is not short of ideas about where to take the story and is in a hurry to get there.

I thought it might be fitting for the bell to be recommissioned and used again in remembrance of the  lives lost.”Towards the end of , Bill contacted a local craftsman and friend, Richard Wilson, and askedhe could help. It had been hoped to have the clapper made and fitted ready for the anniversary in , however plans had to be delayed due to the pandemic.In the meantime, Richard carried out online research and was eventually able to get inside the Cathedral to measure up, acquiring the bronze for the clapper proved dficult locally so he had to source it online.“It took me around a fortnight to make the clapper in my shed at home mostly using a hobby lathe and a CNC router,# said Richard.#I was a bit taken aback when Bill asked me to do this for him. Obviously, it is a great honour and a privilege for me to be asked considering the history of the ship and the lives lost during the sinking.#Hopefully this clapper will be around for years to come and will be used to commemorate the event each year.”However, this was only half the tale. The clapper needed a tassel — a rope that someone would actually hold to ring the bell.Fran Hollinrake is the visitor services officer and custodian at the cathedral.She said that, having attended several commemorations over the years, her and her husband Andy became friendly with a couple, John and Tracy Welch.John’s father, Stoker Petty Officer John Welch, was on board HMS Royal Oak the night she sank, but he survived.His son, John, was a rigger in the Tyneside dockyards, and spent much of his working le working with ropes, but ill-health prevented John from making the tassel.Instead he passed the job on to his former apprentice and friend Paul New.John and his we Tracy arrived in Orkney this week and were present at the unveiling.John said of his father#s experience on that fateful night: #The night of the sinking he was on deck having a cigarette when the explosion happened. He managed to get off the ship and into the water and was picked up by the Daisy II.#He said he had held on to another chap in the water who was in dficulty,  as he was an excellent swimmer and had medals for le saving and water polo, but when they were both pulled aboard by the crew of the Daisy unfortunately the other chap had died. He was lucky to escape with burns to his hands and face.#After medical attention I think a week or so later he was sent back to Portsmouth to join another ship.“As I far as I can remember he never ed to Orkney, but after the war attended the reunions in Portsmouth on a regular basis. As for his feelings about that night it wasn’t something he went into in great detail, but he did say thathe could get back on the ship he would know exactly where his gold lighter and cigarette case were.#Representing the council, who maintain the Cathedral on behalf of the people of Orkney, Councillor Stephen Clackson also has a personal connection to the Royal Oak, having tragically lost his uncle Ronald George Clackson when the ship went down.He said: “My Uncle Ronny was the closest sibling in age to my dad and his favourite brother. He was very technically minded and joined the Royal Navy on July , , aged ¾, for ‘  ’ years.#After training at the shore establishment HMS Victory, he was posted to the recommissioned HMS Royal Oak as an ordinary seaman on June , , when the ship was expected to be embarking on a -month tour of the Mediterranean.#Looming hostilities set the course of the battleship in another direction, and by August she was in Scapa Flow. My uncle was reported missing presumed killed when the Royal Oak was sunk by torpedoes from the U- in the early hours of October , just a week after his th birthday.#The news was devastating for my grandmother, whose brother had been killed on the Somme in World War I at the same age, and she never really got over it. I often wonder about my uncle’s short spell in Orkney and how he celebrated his last birthday on October , .”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Everyone is equal under the law and equally subject to the law.ldquoThat means that we have a process that examines all the cases where families have an interest in pursuing justice andafter investigation there is new and compelling evidence that could lead to a prosecution, then I think the PPS and the courts should look at those cases. vw,vw,px, px\"DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson Downing Street said the ldquotragic case illustrated the problems of pursuing historical allegations through the courts.The Prime Ministerrsquos official spokesman said: ldquoOur sincere condolences go to the family, friends and loved ones of Dennis Hutchings.ldquoThe Ministry of Defence supported Mr Hutchings throughout his trial with legal representation and pastoral care, and that will continue to be offered to his family.The spokesman said ldquoitrsquos not for me to comment on the court proceedings, but added: ldquoThis tragic case highlights that the criminal justice approach broadly is no longer working and that is why we are committed to introducing new legislation to bring greater certainty for all communities, including the veterans and families of victims.In July, the Government announced plans for a statute of limitations that would end all prosecutions for Troubles incidents up to April .The death of Hutchings was raised by Ulster Unionist Party leader Doug Beattie as a matter of the day in the Northern Ireland Assembly on Tuesday.Mr Beattie extended his condolences to the families of Hutchings as well as John Pat Cunningham.Hetold MLAs that just as the family of Mr Cunningham deserves truth and justice, so does the Hutchings family.ldquoPeople need to understand or find out why his case was elevated above all other cases, why his case suddenly ended up at the top of the pile hellip and this goes to the heart of some of the issues that we are having to deal with in what is a dficult legacy process which is affecting our present here now, he said.ldquoThat is something we do have to look into, it is something that we do need to examine, to be fair to the family, to understand why this was elevated, we need to understand what was the new evidence which elevated this case and we do need to find out what was in the public interest to bring this case forward.Sinn Fein MLA Linda Dillon described the death of Hutchings as a ldquohuman tragedy.However, she cautioned those criticising the PPS for bringing the case to trial, telling MLAs they are legislators and should not interfere in the judicial process.ldquoThis was a judicial process, it is not for us to interfere in that, she told MLAs.We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Mary Waide, Regional President of SVP North Region, said: “I am absolutely delighted with the success of this series of SVP Member Roadshows and the feedback from those who were able to attend.It was important for the SVP regional board to get out into our local communities having had such a long time apart from our members face to face. The focus of the roadshows were to primarily express our gratitude to our members for the sterling work they have been continuing to do on the ground to help those who have needed it most, during the most trying of times, and to share with them our SVP vision for the longer term. “The dedication of members of SVP has never been more important than it has been in the past  months. I know from experience how daunting it has been trying to help the vulnerable in our community without compromising or risking the health of those who are supporting those in need. As we move forward, it is my hope that our Conferences in County Antrim continue to go from strength to strength under the guidance of Frederic Ozanam who founded SVP almost  years ago.”SVP is an international charity and the largest voluntary charity in Ireland. SVP members in Northern Ireland work in all communities to support people whatever their background, who are experiencing poverty and social exclusion, promoting self-sufficiency and working for social justice.

Chloe’s gold medal finish and her twin sister Judith’s runner up spot was a reverse of the result at the same competition in Drogheda pre lockdown in . googletag.cmd.push It leaves them in eighth and tenth place respectively in the Commonwealth Games rankings where the top ten will qualy for the games in Birmingham next summer. They have been working daily towards their goal at the Foyle Arena where Derry City and Strabane District Council’s Athlete Support Membership Scheme gives them free access to Council leisure facilities. The -year-olds are former students at Limavady Grammar and were diagnosed at birth with a form of albinism that means their sight is around one third of what someone with   vision would experience. They have barely spent a day apart in those  years and both studied geography at Ulster University in Coleraine during which time a chance meeting with Irish triathlon high performance coach Eamon Tilley guided them towards the gruelling discipline.     “We weren’t overly sporty growing up,” Chloe recalled. “We got involved in rugby and rowing at Coleraine and were talent spotted by the Irish para rowing team and while we were there Eamon Tilley suggested we try the triathlon. “We started going to training days in  and we took part in our first race in , we didn’t perform that well but enjoyed the challenge of pushing ourselves so we did a few more events and started to improve.” The big breakthrough for the girls came in  when Judith claimed first and Chloe second place at the National Paratriathlon Championships at Pulse Port Beach in Drogheda, it looked to be the start of an exciting period but the Covid  pandemic led to an end to all competition in . “It was a big challenge to keep the momentum of our training going during lockdown,” said Judith. “We had been coming to the Foyle Arena  or  times a week so to lose access was a big blow. “We have an intimate knowledge of the back roads of Claudy from all the cycling and running we did while the centre was closed, it has been great to get access back, particularly in the pool which has now been ided up for dferent swimming speeds.” “Limerick was our first major event after lockdown so we weren’t sure how it would go,” Chloe added. “I am stronger on the bike but I knew Judith would make up ground on me on the run so I had to make sure I had a lead. “The membership scheme has had a massive impact on our success, training for a triathlon is very expensive and we don’t get any funding so it has been a real leline. “The facilities at the Foyle Arena are world class and the staff and coaches here have been very accommodating and taken a genuine interest in our journey. “To compete at the Commonwealth Games alongside my sister would be a dream come true and that goal drives us each day to train harder and get faster.” Opportunities The Athlete Support Membership Scheme aims to provide talented local athletes involved in an amateur sport with the best possible opportunities to develop and prepare for competition. Applicants must be currently part of a recognised gover​ning body, talent pathway or be officially representing their sport at county level or higher. Applicants who fulfil the criteria will be entitled to six months free access to gym, health suite and swimming pool facilities, they must be involved in an amateur sport which is recognised by either Sport Northern Ireland or the Irish Sports Council. Sports coordinator at Derry City and Strabane District Council, Keith Thompson, said: “World level athletes need world class facilities to compete at the highest level and we are delighted to be able to support a number of elite athletes at the Foyle Arena through free membership. “The team at the Foyle Arena are delighted for them and we are pleased to have played a role in their success.” To apply for the Athlete Support Membership scheme e mail Keith at keith.thompson@ derrystrabane.

Expectation is mounting with an announcement possible before the weekend on the official date. The US has this week also announced the lting of travel restrictions with Canada and Mexico across its land borders for the same time in early November. Irish travellers will be eagerly awaiting official word to book flights to visit the likes of New York during the Christmas period but they will still be expected to adhere to some restrictions. Before travelling, Aer Lingus customers are advised to use the airline’s newonline travel support toolto search by destination and retrieve up-to-date tailored travel information based on their specic circumstances including vaccination status,travel and flight connection requirements.

The Helicopter Emergency Medical Servicerecently reported that July this year broke the record as its busiest month, with team being called out  times - three of which were in the Derry City and Strabane District Council area - and clocking up  flying hours in total. googletag.cmd.push The service, which aims to save lives, brains and limbs, has been tasked to the Derry City and Strabane District Council area  times from its inception in July  to August this year. The charity held its second abseil at the Tower Museum on the September  which saw  local people conquering the  foot drop on one of the city’s most iconic buildings. Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District Council, Graham Warke, attended the event to show his support for Air Ambulance NI. Participating in the abseil were two members from the local Chamber of Commerce Paul Clancy, chief executive, and Aidan O’Kane, Allstate NI director.     Abseiling alongside them were Karen McQuillan, finance director at Find Insurance, the main sponsors of this year’s Chamber dinner which Chamber president Dawn McLaughlin has chosen will benefit Air Ambulance NI.  Dawn McLaughlin, president of Derry Chamber of Commerce, with participants who took part in the abseil of the Tower Museum in aid of the Air Ambulance.  Also partaking in the adrenaline fuelling challenge was Caroline Doyle who is a member of the AANI agribusiness group and agricultural business manager for Barclays who are match-funding Caroline’s donations. City of Derry Young Farmers Club celebrated their th anniversary this year and decided to mark the milestone by raising funds for Air Ambulance NI in memory of member Gordon Crocketts father, David, who sadly lost his le last year in a farming accident. The young farmers sourced a -year-old Fendt tractor and used it duringa -hour plough at a family fun day in Eglinton in September last, the event raising over pound, for the charity. Also, Foyle Food Group brought the agribusiness together at a barbecue. Karen Kelso, group commercial director said: “It was lovely to be able to host this event both in recognition of the company milestone and to raise vital funds for the air ambulance given the downturn in fundraising through the pandemic. We were bowled over by the support of our farmers to the charity – we had  attendees on the evening and hundreds more bought tickets knowing they couldn’t attend simply to support this incredible lesaving service. “We would like to extend thanks to our almost  sponsors, all who supported the night and those who attended. Music from Richie Remo and Hugo Duncan was enjoyed by all. Foyle Food Group have raised a staggering pound, for the Air Ambulance NI charity.” However, the community support hasn’t stopped there. As well as these two events, shoppers at local Marks  Spencer’s in Foyleside Shopping Centre have been donating through in-store collection boxes during the health pandemic. Kerry Anderson, head of fundraising, said, “We want to send this special message of thanks to our supporters across Derry to let them know how much their support means to us. Quite literally the service would be grounded without you. This has been the busiest summer to date for the service which costs pound, every single day to maintain. “Although this service forms a vital part of the frontline emergency services in Northern Ireland, our lesaving missions need kind and generous support just like the community efforts we have witnessed recently throughout the city. The Air Ambulance NI volunteers and supporters are like no other, and we are immensely proud to have them as part of the service.”  Derry Chamber of Commerce members abseil from Tower Museum peak for ambulance charity     Top cop highly frustrated with response by public to Lyra McKee murder appeal  Huge frustration at the lack of eye-witnesses who have come forward    Derry man charged with illegally trading in African elephant and sperm whale  Local court told case complicated and unusual   ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Rhonda McKean alleges spending nine hours waiting to be seen at Altnagelvin Hospital.A Western Trust spokesperson said: Due to patient confidentiality we wouldnt be responding to inidual casesLocal NewsWaterside woman with broken back claims nine-hour wait to be seen at Altnagelvin overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsDerry man charged with illegally trading in African elephant and sperm whale overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The incident occurred at Sandy Braes, Magherafelt.Local NewsMurder investigation launched after mans body found in County Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dans Bar, Claudy \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dans Bar, Claudy  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  HomeDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  GAAA new force in fashion overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Gerard Hampsons body was found on shores of Lough Neagh in January Derry NewsInquest for Derry man Gerard Hampson could take place in January overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dans Bar, Claudy \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dans Bar, Claudy  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

As part of a wider campaign of thanksgiving, the Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District Council, Alderman Graham Warke, has called on everyone to show their appreciation through a gesture of thanks directed at someone who played a role in helping others over the past  months. googletag.cmd.push From today until Sunday next, October , buildings in the council area will be illuminated in purple to shine a light on the outstanding efforts made by those not just on the frontline in the NHS, but in our shops, our pharmacies, our care homes, our schools, and in the wider community. Mayor Warke is also asking local people to personally recognise those who made a dference to them by saying thank you, or making a small gesture with a gt or a card. He said: These have been unprecedented times of great hardship and fear for many people and we have come through this thanks to the wide network of dedicated workers and volunteers who have sustained our communities when we most needed help. I would like to ask people to think about someone who made a dference to their lives during lockdown, whether through their day-to-day work or volunteering in the community.     “It could be someone who delivered food parcels, who worked in a shop throughout the pandemic despite the risk, who reached out to an elderly neighbour, or checked in on a loved one.

It comes as part of the Northern Irelands Executives winter Covid contingency plans. The Executive said there was a need to keep as many sectors open to the fullest possible extent. First Minister, Paul Givan said doing that would depend on as many people as possible getting vaccinated.” googletag.cmd.push Just over % of people aged  and above in Northern Ireland had received one dose of the vaccine. Mr Givan said: Our vaccination rates are very good but there is still room for improvement.” Further Covid restrictions are due to be relaxed by the Executive onOctober . This will allow for nightclubs to reopen, restrictions on indoor dancing lted and the requirement to be seated in hospitality to drink and eat food will no longer be in place. Mr Givan said it was a fact of le that Covid remains an ongoing issue, and that the Executive needed to continue to find ways to manage the situation.     The First Minister says that the Executive will launch a new public information campaign before the end of October to build on the need for all of us to keep making safer choices. He also said that there would be a focus on “flexible and hybrid working” in workplaces. Mr Givan set out a range of optionsCovid cases rise drastically or hospital pressures become “unsustainable” with the possibility of deploying Covid vaccine passports in high-risk settings, “ considered appropriate.” The Department of Health at Stormont is also working on a systemthis situation arises that would see the strengthening of self-isolation rules for close contacts of those who contract the virus and a re-imposition in law of social distancing in certain settings. He continued: The efforts that have been made by so many in recent months to drive up vaccination rates and step-up compliance with mitigations do seem to be working. It is vital that we dont let up. We must maintain our focus and collective endeavour.

The Sky Blues slumped to a second consecutive defeat at the hands of Newry City – despite having taken the lead. Benny McLaughlin gave Stute an early lead at the Brandywell but an equaliser from Stephen Lawless and James Teelans strike on the hour gave Newry the points. googletag.cmd.push While Donaghey could not fault his troops for work-rate, a lack of quality has caused enough concern for him to seek new blood to bolster his squad. He said: “Without revealing too much, Ive ten players in mind who Id like to bring to the team. “It would be great to get all of them but it could very well work out that I go for ten and end up being able to bring in three on that list. “We will have to see. By Christmas, that list could potentially rise to twenty but, I will be trying to get new faces in to add to our numbers.     “Ive not yet entered into any talks with most of them as they are still under contract at their own clubs. Those who are at amateur level I have had a chat with. Again we will have to wait and see. “With the squad that I have right now, the work-rate is there but we are just missing that bit of quality that can convert that work-rate into points and get us higher up the league. “We not only need to create more chances but we have to take them too. A good side like Newry showed that last week. “Im also looking to see where the leaders in our squad are and for them to step up. It doesnt help when you have injuries to key players but you still have to show some leadership out there. “Newry are the best team weve played so far but some of our players need to grow up very quickly. “I knew what I was getting into when I arrived here but it seems we do need to strengthen the squad which is what Ill be trying to do.” Institute currently lie third from bottom in the NIFL Championship and face a tricky-trip to promotion-chasing Ballyclare Comrades on Saturday. Comrades flexed their muscles ahead of Institutes visit with a - win at fourth in the table, Annagh United. Donaghey added: “Ballyclare are a very progressive club with lots of experience in their squad. “However,we can step up and add the quality needed to go with our work-rate, we can hopefully get something.”ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Rhonda McKean alleges spending nine hours waiting to be seen at Altnagelvin Hospital.A Western Trust spokesperson said: Due to patient confidentiality we wouldnt be responding to inidual casesLocal NewsWaterside woman with broken back claims nine-hour wait to be seen at Altnagelvin overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsDerry man charged with illegally trading in African elephant and sperm whale overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The incident occurred at Sandy Braes, Magherafelt.Local NewsMurder investigation launched after mans body found in County Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dans Bar, Claudy \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dans Bar, Claudy  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  HomeDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  GAAA new force in fashion overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Gerard Hampsons body was found on shores of Lough Neagh in January Derry NewsInquest for Derry man Gerard Hampson could take place in January overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dans Bar, Claudy \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dans Bar, Claudy  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

McCarter watched his side put in a sterling performance down at Cork as they headed back up north with a - win at Sundays Well. googletag.cmd.push Alex McDonnell led the way with a try, a penalty and two conversions with Paddy Blennerhasset also crossing over. It has been a slow start to the season for City of Derry but as McCarter says, this victory was hard-earned and well-deserved. He said: “It was a good one to get – a great performance and, thank God, a good one to get over the line. “Its a bit of a monkey of our back now. To be honest, whenever youre not winning its dficult at times. “We havent had much luck in terms of injuries and players not being available.     “Even on the morning of the game, one of the players – David Lapsley – woke up feeling very unwell. “He didnt even make it out of the hotel and with everything  thats gone before, youre starting to think that the rugby Gods just dont want us to win another game. “David just woke and felt unwell. His balance wasnt great so we just kept him in the hotel room. We were down a man before we had already started. “We got him back on the bus after the game and hopefully he will be better over the next few days. “As for the game itself, we knew it was important to get a good start – which we did. But within two minutes we were back at seven-all. “That was frustrating because we had started well for the first time in a while. We were definitely the better team up to that point and it was frustrating to give away a cheap score. “We picked ourselves back up again and got a penalty to take the lead going into half-time. We had been playing into a breeze the opening forty minutes so we had negotiated the conditions pretty well. “We had a big forty minutes to put in for the second half and showed good discipline in forcing Sundays Well to give away a lot of penalties. “We put the pressure on them and forced them into a lot of knock-ons. Adam Marley was very effective as he forced three or four turnovers. We never allowed them to gain any momentum. “Then Alex scored a special inidual try – it came at an important time as well. Alex has the ability to create something out of nothing and he did that with a nice chip over the top which he finished well. “Sundays Well came back into it but I felt we could hold on. Looking back, the last five minutes were more comfortable than they were at the time.” The win takes City of Derry to fth spot in the All-Ireland Division c. However, having got the winning feeling, they now have to wait nearly two weeks before their next game at home to Bangor on October . McCarter added: “I suppose you could say its frustrating not to be playing the week after having got a win but we look at it as having an extra week to get those players who are injured more time to recover. Especially when weve a tough match in Bangor coming up next.”ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Rhonda McKean alleges spending nine hours waiting to be seen at Altnagelvin Hospital.A Western Trust spokesperson said: Due to patient confidentiality we wouldnt be responding to inidual casesLocal NewsWaterside woman with broken back claims nine-hour wait to be seen at Altnagelvin overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsDerry man charged with illegally trading in African elephant and sperm whale overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The incident occurred at Sandy Braes, Magherafelt.Local NewsMurder investigation launched after mans body found in County Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dans Bar, Claudy \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dans Bar, Claudy  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  HomeDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  GAAA new force in fashion overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Gerard Hampsons body was found on shores of Lough Neagh in January Derry NewsInquest for Derry man Gerard Hampson could take place in January overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dans Bar, Claudy \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dans Bar, Claudy  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Simon asked me to cover the Derry tech scene – how it’s altered in the almost  years I’ve been working in the city and perhaps more importantly, what the missing ingredients are that would make the Maiden City’s tech scene really sing. I enjoyed writing it and was surprised to find that no-one  has written about this. Here’s what I had to say in full. How much has the Derry tech scene changed  I began working in Derry in . I moved from Belfast where I’d been global CFO in one of QUB’s semiconductor IP spinouts.I’d spent a good bit of my time in the early noughties in Silicon Valley and Derry in  couldn’t have been further from San Jose. The only similarity was that the streets were completely deserted by .pm.     When I told my friends in Belfast that I was taking a job in Derry they all tried to talk me out of it. I remember trying to recruit a team in  and talent was very thin on the ground. Most of the local workforce were lers in one of the FDIs or they commuted to tech jobs in either Belfast or Letterkenny. The local tech scene back then was dominated by the prominent FDIs Seagate  Allstate , big fish Singularityand a never-ending raft of call centres and it was populated by revered avuncular middle-aged men like Bro McFerran and Dr Alan McClure. Anyone calling the HP or Expedia customer help lines back in the day would’ve been greeted by a Derry accent, way before it was trendy. We started Learning Pool in London in  and quickly moved the company to Derry because it was bootstrap-affordable and because of the ready talent graduating from Magee. We couldn’t afford to hire an experienced team so we recruited new graduates with the right attitude and trained them. We didn’t have an office so we took a few desks in theshockingly haphazard co-working space at the university. Even though the space was supposed to be reserved for new startups, a few companies had been renting in there forever so we ended up with desks dotted here and there in random parts of the floor. No-one in our team could sit together and the co-working space manager constantly shushed us whenever we took phone calls and harped on forever about the washing-up. We had a desktop PC in the corner with a paper notice sellotaped to the top of it which read DO NOT SWITCH OFF  Today there’s a stable of promising scaling tech companies choosing to base themselves in Derry. Established companies likeElemental Software  Newer entrants like medtech company Respiratory Analytics, cyber security companyITUSand caretech challenger startupInCharge. Many companies keep one foot in Derry and the other in Donegal, thus preserving their EU status for access to customers and funding. Catalyst Incopened its doors in  on the historic Fort George site just outside the city and has been a great formal addition to the fabric of the local ecosystem. Other active startup supports likeStartacusand new island of Ireland female founder community AwakenHubare anchored in Derry. Today, the local tech scene is younger, more female, less formal, more global, well educated and informed and definitely ambitious. A lot of newer founders have lived away from Ireland for a while but are electing tohome and settle down, build a business. Catalyst’s Co-Founders programme has uncovered some interesting nascent companies. Some of those new graduates that I recruited back in  or  have gone on to found their own startups. That’s how ecosystems work. The FDIs are still present but they’re less dominant today. They don’t have a lot of employee churn and just tick along in the background, largely behind closed doors. They bring employment to an area of Northern Ireland that badly needs it and they sponsor the odd event and programme. Many of the call centres seem to have been bought over and have disappeared. Innovation and all the interesting stuff happens in the smaller, agile companies around the edges and this is what we need more of. As well as the FDIs we now have the presence of indigenous scaleups like Kainosand FinTru. It would be great to see a few more like these moving in but high quality office space is an issue. Maybe not so important in the future we’re facing post-COVID. The traditional talent pool has extended from the Bann well into Donegal and in Derry I’ve worked beside people who’ve commuted daily from as far afield as Ballycastle and Creeslough. Missing Ingredients If it was Christmas morning and I could have three wishes to improve the tech sector ecosystem in the North West this is what I would wish for: - An ambitious cross-border university named after the late John Hume with campuses in both Derry and Donegaland strong links into the powerful North West diaspora that stretches from Philadelphia to London to Singapore. I’m always impressed by the vibrant startup scene that exists in Letterkenny as a result of the numerous overseas students and researchers who come to LYIT for academic reasons and end up staying. This new university to be fastened at the hip to a well funded and well resourced startup, student and alumni accelerator regime like Oxford University has withOxford Foundrywhich in turn connects firmly into sources of venture finance, a bit likeEDEMin the marina in Valencia - A Derry-Letterkenny- Sligo-Galway Economic Corridor along the Wild Atlantic Way to mirror the Belfast-Dublin corridor that was formally announced in the east of the island last month. This to connect the opportunities that will naturally flow from the new Magee Medical School to the vibrant medtech cluster of companies and investors in Galway and to link in with the newly reinvigorated Western Development Commissionand the string of Atlantic hubs the Irish State has invested in over recent years. I am encouraged by news of a new cross-border scaling hub led by Catalyst Inc  LYIT which will be built in the image of thePortershedGalway model - A focus placed on determining how Derry and indeed all of Northern Ireland can tangibly and quickly benefit from being so close to an EU border in the post-Brexit world. Can Derry compete with Belfast  This was a provocative question posed by Simon in his brief to me. In my view, this is not the right question and shouldn’t be part of anyone’s ambition. Any venture starting out in the new world should instead think about opportunities presented as a result of global changes that the past  months have fast tracked. It’s now genuinely possible to be a global company from Day  and utilise talent from any part of the globe. Barriers no longer exist. Cities and regions need to start thinking this way too. To ask Derry to compete only with Belfast would not be setting a big enough challenge. So, in conclusion,you’re looking for a friendly and affordable university city to start your tech business, where it’s possible to be in both the UK and the EU, an hour from London by air, where   of the population is aged - and is well educated, where government startup funding is readily available, close to some of Europe’s finest beaches, with top class local state schools and a long history and culture … then maybe you should take a look at Derry. And my final call to action, on  April  Jayne Brady started in a brand new post at Belfast City Council as Belfast’s Digital Innovation Commissioner. An engineer and former Venture Capital Partner, in the  months since Jayne started she’s made a massive dference and she represents Belfast at the digital and innovation negotiating tables in both Westminster and Dublin. In truth, although she works for Belfast City Council she does her very best to represent all of Northern Ireland. Isn’t it time we appointed a Digital Innovation Commissioner to do the same and really own this agenda for the NW region of Ireland and its citizens, present and future ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Rhonda McKean alleges spending nine hours waiting to be seen at Altnagelvin Hospital.A Western Trust spokesperson said: Due to patient confidentiality we wouldnt be responding to inidual casesLocal NewsWaterside woman with broken back claims nine-hour wait to be seen at Altnagelvin overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsDerry man charged with illegally trading in African elephant and sperm whale overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The incident occurred at Sandy Braes, Magherafelt.Local NewsMurder investigation launched after mans body found in County Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dans Bar, Claudy \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dans Bar, Claudy  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  HomeDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  GAAA new force in fashion overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Gerard Hampsons body was found on shores of Lough Neagh in January Derry NewsInquest for Derry man Gerard Hampson could take place in January overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dans Bar, Claudy \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dans Bar, Claudy  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Its clothing perfectly suited to the GAA fan looking for something slightly dferent, without club crests and sponsor logos.Fergal, along with his twin brother Fergal and friend Paul Hughes – Chairman of Derrytresk– is happy with how their brand has progressed. Originally, they had planned to launch for Christmas, but a change saw them get the ball rolling in April, in time for the twins th birthday celebrations.“It gave us something to focus on and one of the jumpers has  on the back, to signy the year we were born,” Fergal told the County Derry Post.There was always an interest in designing and a clothing brand was never far from his thoughts. During his playing days, hed never be far away when new kits were being deigned. A retro jersey released as part of Slaughtneils gear range had his fingerprints on it.“We are from a farming background, it is not the sort of thing youd associate us with...getting into fashion,” Fergal jokes.“But, its always something we have been interested in. I just think a lot of the GAA gear is based on playing members and wanted to do something dferent to appeal to our non-playing members as much as players.“A lot of it will carry club badges and sponsor logos, whereas not everybody wants to wear that kind of product to go to games.”Still playing for the clubs recreational team, he coaches the U footballers and hurlers. There is a pride in pulling into Emmet Park and seeing the Gael Foacutersa range, across dferent ages and colours. Interchangeable caps. Beanies. Shorts. Sweatshirts. T-Shirts. Half-zips. From black to white and green to mango, there is something for everyone. “I am not necessarily going to pull on my club gear, but I still want to pull on something that will associate you with the GAA,” he explains of their brands unique selling point.The name – Gael Foacutersa #WeAllBelong – was spun out of that inkling he had all those years ago.“I always had it in my head, thatI ever did start up a brand, that Gael Force would be the name I would go with,” Fergal explains.“We wanted to keep the Irish slant on it as well. It is very important to the club and community.”And so, Gael Foacutersa – True Gael – was born. After some scribbling with the lettering, the logo eventually came to le by accident. “The plan was to launch it on the lead up to Christmas”, Fergal adds. “Then we thought, the idea is there and well get something out there. Me and Francis, it was our th birthday in April, wed give ourselves a date to work to, to have the product launched.“We are very thankful for the support we have got from everybody. You now notice now the orders coming in, even from other counties, so it definitely seems to be going the right way.”Nestled deep within the brand is the importance of knowing that the game is much more than being part of the squad and taking to the field. It is about identity. A sense of belonging and inclusivity. Being part of a community of like-minded people with a mutual love for traditions and heritage.“So much of our young children and adult lives have become about the constant need to train, to diet, to play, to watch, to support, to belong but ultimately to win,” Gael Foacutersa outline in the story on their website.“Gael Foacutersa is about getting away from these pressures and the responsibilities of the game.We want to take it back to the basics. It’s about the enjoyment of it all and putting smiles on peoples faces.“The Gael Foacutersa range offers high-quality, comfortable and eye-catching men’s and ladies leisurewear. It aims to reinforce the customer’s sense of identity. To be more than just about the game. It’s about being part of something bigger.” googletag.cmd.push For the full range, check out their website: www.gaelforsa.ie    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Rhonda McKean alleges spending nine hours waiting to be seen at Altnagelvin Hospital.A Western Trust spokesperson said: Due to patient confidentiality we wouldnt be responding to inidual casesLocal NewsWaterside woman with broken back claims nine-hour wait to be seen at Altnagelvin overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsDerry man charged with illegally trading in African elephant and sperm whale overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The incident occurred at Sandy Braes, Magherafelt.Local NewsMurder investigation launched after mans body found in County Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dans Bar, Claudy \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dans Bar, Claudy  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  HomeDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  GAAA new force in fashion overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Gerard Hampsons body was found on shores of Lough Neagh in January Derry NewsInquest for Derry man Gerard Hampson could take place in January overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dans Bar, Claudy \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dans Bar, Claudy  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Its clothing perfectly suited to the GAA fan looking for something slightly dferent, without club crests and sponsor logos.Fergal, along with his twin brother Fergal and friend Paul Hughes – Chairman of Derrytresk– is happy with how their brand has progressed. Originally, they had planned to launch for Christmas, but a change saw them get the ball rolling in April, in time for the twins th birthday celebrations.“It gave us something to focus on and one of the jumpers has  on the back, to signy the year we were born,” Fergal told the County Derry Post.There was always an interest in designing and a clothing brand was never far from his thoughts. During his playing days, hed never be far away when new kits were being deigned. A retro jersey released as part of Slaughtneils gear range had his fingerprints on it.“We are from a farming background, it is not the sort of thing youd associate us with...getting into fashion,” Fergal jokes.“But, its always something we have been interested in. I just think a lot of the GAA gear is based on playing members and wanted to do something dferent to appeal to our non-playing members as much as players.“A lot of it will carry club badges and sponsor logos, whereas not everybody wants to wear that kind of product to go to games.”Still playing for the clubs recreational team, he coaches the U footballers and hurlers. There is a pride in pulling into Emmet Park and seeing the Gael Foacutersa range, across dferent ages and colours. Interchangeable caps. Beanies. Shorts. Sweatshirts. T-Shirts. Half-zips. From black to white and green to mango, there is something for everyone. “I am not necessarily going to pull on my club gear, but I still want to pull on something that will associate you with the GAA,” he explains of their brands unique selling point.The name – Gael Foacutersa #WeAllBelong – was spun out of that inkling he had all those years ago.“I always had it in my head, thatI ever did start up a brand, that Gael Force would be the name I would go with,” Fergal explains.“We wanted to keep the Irish slant on it as well. It is very important to the club and community.”And so, Gael Foacutersa – True Gael – was born. After some scribbling with the lettering, the logo eventually came to le by accident. “The plan was to launch it on the lead up to Christmas”, Fergal adds. “Then we thought, the idea is there and well get something out there. Me and Francis, it was our th birthday in April, wed give ourselves a date to work to, to have the product launched.“We are very thankful for the support we have got from everybody. You now notice now the orders coming in, even from other counties, so it definitely seems to be going the right way.”Nestled deep within the brand is the importance of knowing that the game is much more than being part of the squad and taking to the field. It is about identity. A sense of belonging and inclusivity. Being part of a community of like-minded people with a mutual love for traditions and heritage.“So much of our young children and adult lives have become about the constant need to train, to diet, to play, to watch, to support, to belong but ultimately to win,” Gael Foacutersa outline in the story on their website.“Gael Foacutersa is about getting away from these pressures and the responsibilities of the game.We want to take it back to the basics. It’s about the enjoyment of it all and putting smiles on peoples faces.“The Gael Foacutersa range offers high-quality, comfortable and eye-catching men’s and ladies leisurewear. It aims to reinforce the customer’s sense of identity. To be more than just about the game. It’s about being part of something bigger.” googletag.cmd.push For the full range, check out their website: www.gaelforsa.ie    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Rhonda McKean alleges spending nine hours waiting to be seen at Altnagelvin Hospital.A Western Trust spokesperson said: Due to patient confidentiality we wouldnt be responding to inidual casesLocal NewsWaterside woman with broken back claims nine-hour wait to be seen at Altnagelvin overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsDerry man charged with illegally trading in African elephant and sperm whale overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The incident occurred at Sandy Braes, Magherafelt.Local NewsMurder investigation launched after mans body found in County Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dans Bar, Claudy \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dans Bar, Claudy  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  HomeDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  GAAA new force in fashion overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Gerard Hampsons body was found on shores of Lough Neagh in January Derry NewsInquest for Derry man Gerard Hampson could take place in January overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dans Bar, Claudy \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dans Bar, Claudy  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

The scheme is a recycling initiative which he had championed during his time as Environment Minister and has worked to progress in recent years. In response to an Assembly Question tabled by Mr Durkan, the Minister of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs , Edwin Poots reaffirmed his commitment to introduce the scheme, following the department’s joint consultation with DAERA and the Welsh Government. googletag.cmd.push The Foyle MLA said: “I’m pleased that work is continuing to progress a depositscheme for Northern Ireland. “This is a scheme which began work on during my time as Environment Minister, having seen their benefits in other countries. “Unfortunately, at that time my attempts were met with some resistance, both politically and commercially. “In February , the Executive supported my calls for the introduction of a depositscheme and committed to the North’s participation in a proposed UK-wide rollout. I welcome that the consultation process has been completed and welcome Minister Poots commitment to delivering this scheme and move towards a circular economy.     “While awareness in recent years has improved where recycling is concerned, we are still not at the level we need to be. “A cash incentive under a Deposit Return Scheme, in my opinion, is the best way forward and will encourage an uptake in recycling. “Our throw-away culture is completely unsustainable and our planet is bearing the brunt of it. “In recent years, we have witnessed a growing realisation that action must be taken by governments, businesses and iniduals to address the damage being done to our environment. “I would like to see this scheme expanded to include cans and plastic bottles, building on the success of the carrier bag levy, to tackle the scourge of single use plastic on our communities. “I hope the Minister will revisit an all-island approach for this initiative but for now it is crucial that we push forward on implementing this environmentally transformative scheme without further delay. “ ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Rhonda McKean alleges spending nine hours waiting to be seen at Altnagelvin Hospital.A Western Trust spokesperson said: Due to patient confidentiality we wouldnt be responding to inidual casesLocal NewsWaterside woman with broken back claims nine-hour wait to be seen at Altnagelvin overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsDerry man charged with illegally trading in African elephant and sperm whale overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The incident occurred at Sandy Braes, Magherafelt.Local NewsMurder investigation launched after mans body found in County Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Rhonda McKean, , had a bout of painful sciatica that made it dficult to walk. Using a rollator frame, she took a fall and was told by her Doctors surgery, Oakleaf Medical Practice, to make her way to Altnagelvin. googletag.cmd.push However, a nine-hour wait in pain followed that didnt even result in Mrs McKean being seen that day. As a result, she had to make ajourney where she was eventually X-rayed. She said: “Six weeks ago, I had sciatica and during the night, it became so uncomfortable that it wouldnt let me walk. “I had a rollator in the house and I thought Id use that because theres no way that I would be able to get about. “Unfortunately, I managed to fall hard on to the ground and I knew that I hurt my back. “I rang the doctors surgery and was told Id get a call back from the doctor. Instead, I get a call back from the physiotherapist.     “He told me to come overso I struggled over and he told me I needed to go to Altnagelvin Hospital for an X-ray on my hip because he thought I had fractured that. “I told him that I definitely hadnt fractured my hip but had hurt my back. The X-ray showed that I hadnt broken my hip. “I went back to the surgery and the physio went to get the doctor who came back and told me that the physio wanted me to go to Altnagelvin because he thinks youve had a stroke. “I then get to Altnagelvin where I sat in the waiting area at casualty for nine hours. “I had been sent to get a brain scan but they wouldnt do one because they said I didnt have a stroke. “But during all that time, I was in pure agony as having been sitting in AE for nine hours. My back was broke but the doctors hadnt told me as they hadnt read the report in the bone scan. “I later had an X-ray and was told I had an L lumber fracture. I then had a further MRI scan.” Unfortunately, that scan would bring bad news for Mrs McKean which was compounded by it being given not by her GP at Oakfield Medical Practice, but by the receptionist. Mrs McKean added: “Last Friday , I got a letter to go to X-ray for an ultrasound on my thyroid. “I phoned up the surgery to speak to my GP to ask why I have been requested to go for an ultrasound to my thyroid. “The girl on reception put me on hold and then came back to tell me, the MRI scan showed a growth on your thyroid. “The receptionist told me that and the doctor himself couldnt even let me know. He didnt even have the decency to phone me and tell me this was happening. Yet its left to a receptionist to tell me point-blankely because theywont let me speak to a doctor.” Regarding Mrs McKeans nine-hour wait at Altnagelvin, a spokesperson for the Western Health and Social Care Trust said: “Due to patient client confidentiality we would not be responding to inidual cases. “If a patient client or their relative has any issue in relation to their treatment or the service they have received, we would encourage them to raise these issues through the Trusts comments and complaints system - the Patients Advocate Office. “The Patients Advocate Office can be contacted on .

Ms McLaughlin vacates her role as Economy Spokesperson to take up the position as as chair of the Assemblys Committee for the Executive Office as well as being the SDLPs spokesperson on Covid Recovery. googletag.cmd.push The reshuffle also sees a move for East Derry MLA, Cara Hunter. She moves from the position of Mental Health Spokesperson to the role of Climate Champion. Cara will also sit on the Infrastructure Committee. Ms McLaughlins fellow Foyle MLA, Mark H Durkan, remains in his post as Communities  Culture Spokesperson. Foyle MP Mr Eastwood insisted that the shakeup of the party’s spokespeople is about holding Ministers to account and delivering better outcomes for people across the north of Ireland. He said: “The SDLP has the most energetic and effective front bench teams of any party in the Assembly. “The changes I have announced today will build on the work we have been doing over the last two years to change the lives of the people we represent.     “At a moment when others are retreating to the politics of boycott, ision and deadlock, the SDLP team is committed to breaking down barriers and delivering on the priorities of people in all of our communities. “That means managing the Covid- recovery, addressing the climate crisis and driving forward a prosperity agenda. “As part of these changes I have created new roles that reflect urgent political priorities.  “Sinead McLaughlin MLA will take on an ambitious new portfolio focussed on Covid recovery. Given the cross-cutting nature of this brief I have appointed Sinead as Chair of the Executive Office Committee where she will hold the First Ministers to account for the abject failure to produce a robust strategy to transform our society. “I have also appointed Cara Hunter MLA as the SDLP Climate Champion, reflecting the urgent need to address the crisis of global temperature increases and the impact it will have on a whole generation of people. “The consequences of inaction are severe and the SDLP is bringing tough legislative proposals at Stormont and Westminster that will address the crisis. Cara will also take on a new portfolio focussed on the ambitions and needs of a new generation of young people. “The SDLP team is full of ambitious and talented public representatives who have the energy and the ideas to transform our society. Applying their skills and experience to their new roles, I know that they’ll deliver for the people we represent.” Reacting to her new role on Twitter, Sinead McLaughlin said: “My new role starts this week as chair of the Assemblys Committee for the Executive Office, where I will be holding the joint first ministers to account, leading the SDLPs work on Covid recovery and demanding that Derry is treated with the justice and equality my city deserves.”ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Rhonda McKean alleges spending nine hours waiting to be seen at Altnagelvin Hospital.A Western Trust spokesperson said: Due to patient confidentiality we wouldnt be responding to inidual casesLocal NewsWaterside woman with broken back claims nine-hour wait to be seen at Altnagelvin overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsDerry man charged with illegally trading in African elephant and sperm whale overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The incident occurred at Sandy Braes, Magherafelt.Local NewsMurder investigation launched after mans body found in County Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dans Bar, Claudy \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dans Bar, Claudy  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  HomeDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  GAAA new force in fashion overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Gerard Hampsons body was found on shores of Lough Neagh in January Derry NewsInquest for Derry man Gerard Hampson could take place in January overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dans Bar, Claudy \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dans Bar, Claudy  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

An event held in Coleraine by Cuil Rathain Historical and Cultural Centre to mark the centenary of the establishment of Northern Ireland included a re-enactment of a B Specials checkpoint and drill demonstration as part of its itinerary. googletag.cmd.push Alongside music and dance demonstrations, involving bands and Lambeg drums, and childrens arts and crafts activities, a group held a historical re-enactment, complete with unorms and props.  The B Specials, known as the Ulster Special Constabulary, was formed just before partition, and was almost exclusively Protestant. They were involved in a number of controversial incidents, including the attack on civil rights marchers at Burntollet in , before being disbanded in . East Derry MLA Cara Hunter said the staging of the re-enactment was not appropriate. I am shocked that the organisers of this event thought that this was in any way appropriate, said the SDLP representative.     Contrary to the public comments from the festival organisers, there is no positivity associated with this sectarian force that maimed and murdered Catholics at Civil Rights protests. Cara Hunter MLA “The inclusion of this event in this centenary programme is isive, crass and alienating. It sends a clear message that the organisers have no interest in promoting cross community cohesion. More to the point, it suggests that the B Specials represent the tradition of unionism here. That could not be further from the truth. The event was advertised as being funded by the Ulster Scots Agency and Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council, with the organisations providing pound, and pound, respectively. However, the Cuil Rathain Historical and Cultural Centre said the re-enactment had been entirely self-funded. We feel it is important that we, as the lead partner of the organising committee, clary the situation in relation to funding arrangements in respect of the B Specials Historical Re-enactment group, they said. We wish to confirm that this element of the programme is being self-funded entirely by the organisers. No funding awarded by either Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council or the Ulster Scots Agency will be used in respect of this element of the event programme. We hope that this statement claries the situation and allays any concerns anyone may have. On the day after the event, the group also shared what they described as an informative presentation on the B Specials to their Facebook page.

Available exclusively in Attitude Black paintwork, the new Sport Black Edition brings a distinctive sporty look to Toyota’s fth-generation RAV, and is available in front-wheel-driveguise only.  googletag.cmd.push   However, for buyers looking for the added security of an all-wheel-drivedrivetrain in their new RAV, there is the option of AWD in Sol, Sport and Platinum iants, while the entry-level Luna model is FWD only.Petrol Electric PowertrainLike every iant in the RAV range, the Sport Black Edition is powered by a .-litre four-cylinder petrol-electric hybrid powertrain, which produces bhp and Nm of torque and enables the five-seat family SUV to sprint from -km h in just over  seconds. Standard across the entire RAV range is a suite of safety features which offer maximum protection for all occupants, while providing the RAV driver with the latest technology in driver assistance systems.         Collectively called Toyota Safety Sense  , features include Pre-Collision Assistance , Speed Assistance , Lane Keepingand Automatic High Beam Assist.Gracious Exterior, Spacious InteriorThe exterior design of the new RAV is more appealing and less anonymous that its predecessor, and this is gained by way of boxy wheel arches, a squared-off nose with a large grille, and angular edges and creases in the bodywork. I feel that Toyota has done a great job of making the new RAV look and feel more ‘premium’ than ever, while also offering more interior space than any of its predecessors.Cabin quality is exceptional, with sturdy and durable materials used throughout, while overall passenger space is generous in every respect. This has been made possible by placing the front and rear axles mm further apart than before, and even tall adults will be able to sit in the rear seats comfortably, with plenty of legroom and headroom on offer.The RAV’s battery is located under the floor, but its boxy dimensions help to hide it well, with a slightly higher boot floor the only clue to what lies beneath.Compared to its predecessor, the RAV’s boot capacity has grown to -litres , with a massive ,-litres available when the rear seats are folded down.The RAV was awarded a full five stars by Euro NCAP in  and that was thanks in part to an upgrade to the second-generation of Toyota Safety Sense for the latest model.Test CarMy test car was a RAV Sport Black Edition which drew lots of admiring glances due to its terric road presence and distinctive design details.An impressive array of standard equipment includes TEX leather black upholstery with heated front seats, powered driver seat, auto-dimming interior mirror, front and rear parking sensors, rear view camera, auto lights and wipers, LED front light guide with daytime running lights, LED projector headlights, electrically operated boot door, ” Toyota Touch multimedia system, dual zone climate control, rear privacy glass, satellite navigation, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, black headliner cloth, paddle sht, light blue ambient lighting, and illuminated entry along with many more comfort, convenience, safety and infotainment features.As is the case across all models in the RAV line-up, fuel consumption as low as .l km is achievable on a WLTP combined driving cycle, while Co emissions of between  and g kmensures low annual road tax in addition to low overall running costs.Toyota’s advanced hybrid technology ensures that the RAV’s petrol engine and electric motor combine seamlessly to deliver extra performance and outstanding fuel efficiency, while remaining ultra-smooth and extremely quiet when driving in electric mode.Toyota claim that up to % of the time you drive a Toyota Hybrid, you are in electric mode, with the added advantage that you never have to plug the car in to charge the battery.Toyota’s self-charging hybrid harvests the energy normally lost from deceleration and braking into a small battery. This unit doesn’t have enough capacity to propel the RAV alone for any considerable distance, but it does offer the convenience of being able to charge itself without any input from the driver.The RAV sits on Toyota’s New Global Architecture, which is also used in the Toyota Prius, C-HR and Corolla models. It brings big benefits in ride and handling, with more sophisticated suspension than the old model, so the RAV is capable of turning into corners with a surprising amount of poise and precision, with plenty of grip while resisting dramatic levels of body lean.The RAV’s CVTtransmission is smooth and slick in its operation, while a well-insulated cabin ensures that on-road refinement is top class. When travelling through towns and cities at low speed, the RAV’s electric motor is barely audible, with the engine shutting off entirely when stationary in traffic. At motorway cruising speeds, the RAV settles into a quiet hum, with only small amounts of tyre and wind noise getting through to the cabin.Verdict, Cost and WarrantyWith its unique and distinctive modern styling, faultless build quality, impressive tally of standard equipment and frugal petrol electric hybrid technology, the new RAV has all the necessary ingredients to comfortably fulfil the needs of a growing family.The new RAV Sport Black Edition represents great value. The new Toyota RAV is backed by a three-year ,km warranty, along with a five-year ,km warranty on hybrid components.Additionally, a hybrid battery warranty of up to an incredible -years is available upon completing an annual hybrid health check through Toyota’s nationwide dealer network.

Sleek and stylish, it elegantly combines Hyundai’s award-winning SUV heritage with a visually stunning interpretation of Hyundai’s new Sensuous Sportiness design language — defined by the harmony between proportion, architecture, styling and technology.The arrow-shaped headlamps and wide grille harmonise with the sleek air intake band and narrow LED daytime running-lights on top, to give the front a purposeful, unique look. A dynamic shoulder line provides visual drama to the Bayon’s sporty wedge-shaped profile while, at the rear, arrow-shaped LED rear lights are connected by a red accent line. Positioned far out to the sides, the rear lights enhance the visual impression of width.         The new Bayon is shorter, narrower and lower than its Kona sibling, but stands a fraction taller than the i supermini upon which it is based. While the Kona is offered with an all-electric version, the new Bayon is powered solely by a .-litre MPIfour-cylinder petrol engine across all iants.The ingenious MPI system injects fuel at each cylinder, allowing much greater control over how much fuel the engine burns, leading to impressive fuel efficiency.Well-Appointed Trim LevelsThe new Bayon is available in a choice of three trim levels, namely Comfort Plus, Executive and Executive with a two-tone roof. Standard features from entry level include a rear spoiler, roof rails, sports-style driver and passenger front seats, driver seat height adjuster, height and reach adjustable leather-wrapped steering wheel, air-conditioning, auto light control , temporary spare wheel, cargo net, multi- steering wheel controls, central door locking, Bluetooth, DAB radio, cruise control, and a tyre pressure monitoring system, along with a host of safety features for peace-of-mind motoring.Upgrade to the Executive trimand additional standard features include ” alloy wheels, chrome belt line finisher, body coloured bumpers, shark-fin ariel, aluminium foot pedals, heated front seats, heated steering wheel, automatic air-conditioning, automatic window defogging , power-folding electric mirrors, rear privacy glass, auto wipers, remote central locking, voice recognition, Android Auto  Apple CarPlay, ” audio display, .” LCD supervision cluster, USB charger, wireless phone charger, rear parking sensors, and a rear view camera with dynamic guidelines, along with additional safety tech.Test CarMy test car was a new Bayon Executive .litre MPI, which was finished in elegant Aurora Gray Pearl paintwork that compliments its strong SUV design.Producing PSand Nm of torque, the Bayon can reach km h in .-seconds, while ing up to .mpgon a WLTP combined driving cycle.A low Co emission figure of g km translates to annual road tax of just €.On the road is where the new Bayon really excels, with a terric mix of comfort, control, poise and precision on offer. Road imperfections are dealt with swtly, while noises and knocks from the suspension are well isolated from the cabin.For a relatively small car, the Bayon’s motorway refinement and stability are impressive, while the car corners keenly on twisty roads. A precise steering response ensures that the Bayon is a delight to drive around town, while the standard rear parking sensors and rear view camera in my test car made parking a doddle too.The family-friendly cabin space in the new Bayon is impressive, with rear legroom deserving particular praise.Interior storage comprises a of a deep glovebox, front and rear door bins that can accommodate a large bottle, and a flat shelf for a smartphone at the bottom of the well-constructed dashboard.Boot capacity of -litres can be transformed into a ,-litre space when the rear seat backs are folded down, while an intelligent trunk cover can be stowed away safely within the boot when not in use.The new Hyundai Bayon is available in a multitude of stylish exterior colours, along with the option of a two-tone roof and matching door mirror housings in Phantom Black to create a car perfectly matched to inidual taste. The new Bayon truly is ready to reach new heights in the competitive small crossover SUV market segment.Hyundai’s comprehensive -year unlimited mileage warranty comes as standard, as does a -year AA Roadside Assistance and Free Vehicle Health Check package.

Based on the A-Class of the time, Mercedes-Benz gave its smallest model some SUV flavour with clever body cladding and a raised ride height.  googletag.cmd.push   More SUV-Like Than EverLaunched in , the second-generation GLA also shares its DNA with the latest A-Class, but it gained a more traditional SUV shape. Standing cm taller than its predecessor, the new GLA’s wheel arches are more squared-off in shape and are clad in protective black plastic. Its wheelbase has also been increased to create more passenger space, while the wheels are pushed out to each corner, resulting in much shorter front and rear overhangs.Pitched directly against rivals like the BMW X and Volvo XC hybrids, the new GLA  e uses the same powertrain as the plug-in A-Class— a .-litre petrol engine and bhp electric motor, drawing power from a .kWh battery. The fuel tank in the GLA  e is located ahead of the car’s front axle, which leaves space under the boot to fit the hybrid battery. Importantly, this means that the GLA avoids the awkward box-shaped intrusion into the boot area seen in some plug-in hybrid cars.         Specication DetailsThe new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is available in a choice of two generously-equipped specication levels — Progressive and AMG Line — both of which come with standard features such as stylish five-twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, parking sensors with reversing camera, LED high performance headlamps, Light and Sight package, hard-disc navigation, MBUX multimedia system, digital radio, Android Auto, Apple CarPlay, Seat Comfort package with heated front seats, automatic climate control, roof liner in black fabric, Mercedes-Benz emergency call system, galvanised steering-wheel gearsht paddles, Easy-Pack tailgate, Dynamic Select, acoustic ambient protection, Active Lane Keep Assist, and Speed Limit Assist, along with many more comfort, convenience and security features.Additional AMG Line specication includes lowered comfort suspension, AMG body styling, carbon-structure trim, ” AMG -twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, Artico leather Dinamica microfibre black upholstery, and AMG floor mats.Test CarMy GLA  e ‘Progressive’ test car was finished in Night Black paintwith contrasting Macchiato Beige Black Artico leather upholsteryfor maximum impact.With a % battery charge, my test car estimated its own electric range to be km’s. The car defaults to Hybrid mode when started up, so you proceed in zero-emission fashion at speeds of up to km h, as long as the battery has charge and you accelerate gently.When the petrol engine cuts in performance is strong, as it and the electric motor combine their power in a smooth and orderly fashion. With a combined power output of bhp and a mighty Nm of torque, the GLA  e can sprint from -km h in as little as . seconds, and can achieve a top speed of km h .The petrol engine only really makes its presence known when you ask for more performance, while neat handling and sufficient grip from the driven front wheels provides great confidence on the road. The car’s steering is light but direct, and the ride is more than comfortable enough to deal with rutted road surfaces and speed ramps with ease.Cabin space is impressive, with excellent head, leg and elbow room available for all occupants, while a -litre boot capacity will be more than adequate for most families. However, the GLA’s standard split-folding rear seat backs allow for the transportation of larger items when called upon, with up to ,-litres of space on offer in this mode.The cabin of the new GLA certainly feels vastly improved over the original GLA in every respect. This has been made possible by the latest Mercedes-Benz MBUX interior layout, with crisp digital displays replacing the analogue instrument dials and flowing across onto the dashboard.Buttons have been largely replaced by a controller ahead of the gear-lever and voice control, which uses articial intelligence similar to that found in home smart devices to recognise more natural speech and commands. The turbine air vents from the original GLA have been retained, but the dashboard has been slimmed-down for a more spacious feel.VerdictOverall, the new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is a competent all-rounder that offers a decent electric range, low emissions, predictable handling and a luxurious, technology-filled cabin — encased in a stylish and practical premium compact SUV body.

Reporter: Gary Ferry Oct   addthis, Eoin Toal insists that he and his team mates will give everything between now and the end of the season as Derry City close in on third place and European football. The City captain played a massive role in the - win over St. Patrick’s Athletic at the Brandywell on Friday night, a victory which takes the Candystripes to within one point of third-placed Sligo Rovers. googletag.cmd.push Junior Ogedi-Uzokwe scored the only goal of the game to give City a signicant victory at an important stage of the season. “St. Pat’s are a great side and they are not second in the table for no reason,” Toal said afterwards. “We knew it was going to be a tough game. In the first half we weren’t our best and they probably had a few chances in the first half to go one or two up the main thing for us was to just dig in until half time and come in with a level head. “We knew we would get a few chances and we knew we would have to take them. Jack Malone came on and was brilliant, he gave the ball to Jamie who put in a brilliant cross for Junior to finish and that’s what he’s good at. We dug in really well after that and that’s a sign of a really structured team. We held out at the end there which was really good.”     City have come a long way in a short time under Ruaidhri Higgins, with European football now a real possibility. The team spirit is better than ever for a team that began the season with four successive defeats. “Ruaidhri has been brilliant since he came in,” Toal reiterated. “There’s a really good team spirit at the moment. We know how good a manager is and he definitely wants to bring good football to the Brandywell. “ It will be interesting but we have a big task ourselves and, hopefully, we can push on and try and get into that third spot. That’s our aim, and it’s going to be hard but we’re going to have to dig in and, hopefully, try to get it. “Everyone has to play each other so it’s going to be really tough but hopefully we can take each game as it comes and get the points we need.” Unavoidable The question of Europe is now unavoidable for Higgins, whose team have suffered just one defeat in the last nine league games. With home games against Bohemians and Sligo Rovers still to come, there is no doubt that Derry’s destiny is in their own hands. “Theres no point in playing the question down now with six games to go, he admitted. This was signicant. I think and it puts us right in the hunt for that place. The players deserve huge credit for getting themselves in this position. Its set up for us and well give it a real crack and see where it takes us. If we dont get into Europe it wont be for the want of trying because the players are giving absolutely everything. The staff are giving everything and have been brilliant to work with and theres a real good feel factor around the place at the minute and long may that continue. Friday also saw the biggest attendance at the Brandywell this season, with close to , fans cheering the team on to victory. Those rising numbers could well prove pivotal to City in the remaining games. “The crowd were absolutely brilliant tonight especially when Pats were dominating and had large periods in the game,” Higgins agreed. “They got right behind us and the dference when theres supporters in is mind blowing compared to when theyre not here. “Our supporters I think can identy with this team and appreciate what the players are giving and the players appreciate what the supporters are giving as well so hopefully it remains that way for a long, long time.ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Rhonda McKean alleges spending nine hours waiting to be seen at Altnagelvin Hospital.A Western Trust spokesperson said: Due to patient confidentiality we wouldnt be responding to inidual casesLocal NewsWaterside woman with broken back claims nine-hour wait to be seen at Altnagelvin overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsDerry man charged with illegally trading in African elephant and sperm whale overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The incident occurred at Sandy Braes, Magherafelt.Local NewsMurder investigation launched after mans body found in County Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

They also provide underage hurling via St Patricks, an amalgamation with their parish neighbours St Colms Drum.When Derry won the All-Ireland title in , the countys most successful era, Richard Ferris was part of the winning formula and scored a goal in their opening round against Down that season. Joe Irwin won an Ulster medal with the county and Eunan Rafferty was also on Derry teams in that era.The clubs recent underage development work has provided Michael Mullan to Derrys Ulster minor winning team of , with Tiarnaacuten McHugh, Dara and Ruairi Rafferty part of the group who repeated the feat two seasons later on their way to the All-Ireland Final.Current senior captain Tiarnaacuten Woods has represented Derry at minor and U level, with McHugh and Ruairi Rafferty – who have played senior hurling with Kevin Lynchs – having also played the wee ball game for the county.On the camogie field, Una Rafferty and Aoe Kelly have represented Derry at minor and U level respectively. It has all comeas a result of the work being done at the club.“It is great to have Richard Ferris back involved again,” Shane adds. “He has set up a winter programme in place for the players in first to fth year , with the older players getting looked after under the senior  with their strength and conditioning.”The current senior group has benefited from the influx of youth as they have one eye on the Derry IFC Quarter-Finals later this month.McGonigle paid tribute to those who have sat on club committees down through the years and it has been bolstered with new blood coming on board in recent years to help with the clubs progression. Another great development has been an influx in new coaches coming forward at primary school level. Every bit helps.     Like many other clubs across Ireland, Drumsurn reaches deeper into the locality. They are more than just GAA. Its a social hub that knits everyone together, regardless of age. It offers an identity.On top of their day to day club activities and s.

Photo: Tom Heaney Reporter: Staff Reporter Oct   addthis, Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District Council, Alderman Graham Warke, has described Jason Smyth as inspirational as he hosted a civic reception for the fastest Paralympian on the planet. Eglinton runner Smyth won his sixth Paralympic gold medal in a thrilling final of the T m race at this years Paralympic Games, which took place in Tokyo at the end of August. googletag.cmd.push It extended the world record holders medal tally at major eventsto . Mayor Warke invited Jason and his family to the Guildhall for a special civic reception to mark the continued success of the man nicknamed the GoldSmyth. Speaking after the event, Mayor Warke said: It was an honour to have Jason in the Mayors Parlour and to be able to congratulate him personally on the remarkable success that he has had. To win a sixth Paralympic gold medal and to remain unbeaten in ​years of Paralympics is something most sports people couldnt even dream of. It takes a serious amount of commitment, hard work and sacrice behind the scenes to reach that level of greatness and to perform on the biggest stage, and Jason has managed to do that year in, year out. He has represented our city and district on the world stage, and I felt it was only right that I show our appreciation on behalf of all the people of this Council area.     I want to wish Jason and his family all the very best and, hopefully, we are celebrating even more medals in the future. Jason is an inspiration to so many of us locally and to so many globally as well. His story is one that already has its rightful place in the history books and Im sure there are a few more chapters still to be written. Jason said overcoming injuries, dealing with the Covid- delay to the Games, and winning the final by just . seconds made his latest Paralympic gold one of the sweetest yet. I think, on reflection, because the race was so close and the lead up was so dficult, when I think back on all of the Games, its definitely been the most satisfying win. When Ive needed to get things right, Ive been able to do it - by the finest of margins - but when it counted. When I sit back and look at it, I can say that really went as well as it could have, so its very satisfying, but now Im thinking whats next and Im ready to move forward. He added it was great to be able to attend a Mayors reception and spend time with family members who had supported his journey. Sometimes, were away in the likes of Tokyo and were in our bubble and unaware of whats going on at home or whos watching, but when we do come home its great to see the recognition, the support, and the awareness. Its great to come into the Guildhall with the Mayor and have a reception with family because they are often the people who make the most sacrices.

Photo: Tom Heaney Reporter: Staff Reporter Oct   addthis, Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District Council, Alderman Graham Warke, has described Jason Smyth as inspirational as he hosted a civic reception for the fastest Paralympian on the planet. Eglinton runner Smyth won his sixth Paralympic gold medal in a thrilling final of the T m race at this years Paralympic Games, which took place in Tokyo at the end of August. googletag.cmd.push It extended the world record holders medal tally at major eventsto . Mayor Warke invited Jason and his family to the Guildhall for a special civic reception to mark the continued success of the man nicknamed the GoldSmyth. Speaking after the event, Mayor Warke said: It was an honour to have Jason in the Mayors Parlour and to be able to congratulate him personally on the remarkable success that he has had. To win a sixth Paralympic gold medal and to remain unbeaten in ​years of Paralympics is something most sports people couldnt even dream of. It takes a serious amount of commitment, hard work and sacrice behind the scenes to reach that level of greatness and to perform on the biggest stage, and Jason has managed to do that year in, year out. He has represented our city and district on the world stage, and I felt it was only right that I show our appreciation on behalf of all the people of this Council area.     I want to wish Jason and his family all the very best and, hopefully, we are celebrating even more medals in the future. Jason is an inspiration to so many of us locally and to so many globally as well. His story is one that already has its rightful place in the history books and Im sure there are a few more chapters still to be written. Jason said overcoming injuries, dealing with the Covid- delay to the Games, and winning the final by just . seconds made his latest Paralympic gold one of the sweetest yet. I think, on reflection, because the race was so close and the lead up was so dficult, when I think back on all of the Games, its definitely been the most satisfying win. When Ive needed to get things right, Ive been able to do it - by the finest of margins - but when it counted. When I sit back and look at it, I can say that really went as well as it could have, so its very satisfying, but now Im thinking whats next and Im ready to move forward. He added it was great to be able to attend a Mayors reception and spend time with family members who had supported his journey. Sometimes, were away in the likes of Tokyo and were in our bubble and unaware of whats going on at home or whos watching, but when we do come home its great to see the recognition, the support, and the awareness. Its great to come into the Guildhall with the Mayor and have a reception with family because they are often the people who make the most sacrices.

He creates dark ambient as An Trinse, lo-fi Techno as TFT and has the monthly show ‘First Trans- mission’ on Threads radio. He also works as a designer and animator who has created multi-disciplinary work for clients including Nike and Adidas.  What influences you  googletag.cmd.push “With the An Trinse project I’ve always thought of it as being indebted musically to the surrealism of Nurse with Wound and later Coil with a heavy dose of Irish history in there. “My techno records as TFT are much more straightforward and fit into the classic Dutch Clone Viewlex template or L.I.E.S. I’ve enjoyed handing over the visual side to Ben Lee who is an incredible designer. The current visual work with Maxwell Sterling stems from getting obsessed with Peter Greenway a long time ago and suddenly having an outlet for this baroque sensibility. “Max’s work is so rich and cinematic I was instantly inspired to find a way to create a version of the layered theatrical world of Prosperos Books mixed with images generated via AI with painterly elements and I think we have arrived at a pretty inidual visual soup.”     Any Irish stuff out there  “Some of my favourite Irish music of the last few years has come from the label Fort Evil Fruit, they have built up a formidable discography over the last decade across the spectrum of experimental sound. “Also, a big fan of From the Bogs of Aughuska as we share a love of the crossover of Irish History, drone, and black metal who I always thought deserved more attention, but I guess it’s a bit of a niche interest. “Recently been loving the unpronounceable Lighght from Cork who makes really eclectic danceable electronica”. How was your lockdown  “I can’t pretend I didn’t think it was the end of the world at the start but once we settled into the long-drawn-out boring apocalypse it has shaken up my work a bit. I was in great form, had just completed an An Trinse audio-visual show which premiered at one of CTM festival in Berlin’s associated events in January and was hoping to tour the projects throughout the year plus was in the process of setting up a celebratory gig for my split album with Il Santo Bevitore. “I had also just worked on the visual direction of the NME awards which was one of the biggest projects I had overseen. “That all went in the bin along with my main revenue source working as an editor and animator in the creative industry, so it was a very scary few months till everything stabilised a bit. I tried to use the time to collaborate with artists on music videos which crazily ended up helping on Kylie Minogue’s online show and directing a piece for Yousef and Gorgon City. “I also ended up exhibiting work in some online exhibitions which has led to my current work with the Most Dismal Swamp collective but there was a lot of staring at the wall wondering where it was all going. “Later in the year, I did some online gigs including a collaboration with Bratislavan artists Monika Subrtova which felt gooda little weird staring in a camera in an empty room. The project with Maxwell came out of lockdown as well, we were both working on a video project with architecture collective The Decorators who were similarly trying to find ways to show work when everyone is stuck in the house. “That project has just been shown at the V  A museum at the London Design Festival which was a bit of a dream come true.” New normal  “I’m hoping that the show me and Maxwell are doing at MIRA festival in Barcelona is the start of something positive for the new year. We were slightly shocked to get booked so early as we had so far only presented an embryonic version of the show once and was a bit of a disaster technically. “We have done one more show since and its light years ahead now and very excited about presenting it on m screens.”  Any music over there you’d recommend  “Well i would definitely say check out Max’s new album ‘Turn of Phrase’, I’m extremely excited about working on the live presentation and its without doubt one of the best albums of the year. “My pal Yaws is also putting out some wild bendy tempo electronics that you will struggle to pin down. “Also,anyone is interested in the world of digital art and experimental music, I would check out Clot magazine ran by my wonderful other half.” www.clotmag news performance-maxwell-sterling-stephen-mclaughlin-a-v-at-space--london  ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Rhonda McKean alleges spending nine hours waiting to be seen at Altnagelvin Hospital.A Western Trust spokesperson said: Due to patient confidentiality we wouldnt be responding to inidual casesLocal NewsWaterside woman with broken back claims nine-hour wait to be seen at Altnagelvin overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsDerry man charged with illegally trading in African elephant and sperm whale overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The incident occurred at Sandy Braes, Magherafelt.Local NewsMurder investigation launched after mans body found in County Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

at half time.Downpatrick were desperately unlucky not to find the back of the net just minutes into the second half,as McGrady ran clear of the defenders after a looping ball over the topseemed to have caught Clonduff napping.With lsquokeeper Gribben already off his line, he made the decision to challenge McGrady in an aerial dual that the Downpatrick number  managed to win.However, his slapped effort over the head of the Clonduff custodian clipped back off the post and backinto the possession of the grateful Yellas.A minute later and the Hoops were back threatening the opposition defence, but Clonduff held firm when Branniganrsquos lsquorsquo effort dropped into the danger zone.Barry OrsquoHagan punished the Hoops for not taking their chances as his free sailed over the bar, before Downpatrickrsquos Oran Cunningham saw his effort drt wide at the other end.Charlie Carr extended his sidersquos lead with his second point of the game, although Tim Prenter managed to keep the RGU in touch with a no-nonsense score.McConville restored the margin with a left footed strike before his free pushed his side further in front.Darren OrsquoHagan showed no signs of slowing down as he began bossing play with piercing runs and cute passing, allowing the Yellas to put a foothold on the game.Doherty saw his free drt wide off the mark before Close punished the Hoops with a finely taken point to close out the action before the second water-break.Downpatrick knew the clock was against them, but they werenrsquot quite at panic station yet, as Brannigan converted yet another free after teammate Sean Bell was fouled.Clonduff midfielder Ross Carr pointed immediately after before Brannigan once more replied with a free.However, Darren OrsquoHagan began the move that would decide the match, after a string of neat passes and clever off the ball movement allowed his brother Barry to nip in behind the Downpatrick defence before calmly slotting home into the bottom right corner.The now six-point advantage truly seemed to deflate the Downpatrick side who now knew it would take something very special to force extra-time.Despite a Brannigan free, McConville wrapped up the scoring with a lovely left footed strike to ensure it was his Clonduff outfit who would enter the semi-final draw.This signalled the end of the road for the Downpatrick men, who gave a great account of themselves in this yearrsquos competition.Downpatrick: J Deeny, E Rooney , A Doherty, R Murphy, S Bell, J Bell, C Doherty , D Turley, C McCarron, T Prenter , G Collins, C McGrady , J Brannigan , O Cunningham, C Mooney.Subs: T Smyth, P Turley, A Og Robinson, M Fitzpatrick, T Louden, T McNeill, N Cunningham, D Brannf, T Savage, C Boyd, R Og Quinn, C Farrell, G Trainor.Clonduff: P Gribben, J OrsquoHagan, D OrsquoHagan, T McEvoy, L Branagan, C Carr , J Gribben, R Carr, A Carr , T Close , P OrsquoHagan, B OrsquoHagan , A McConville , S McConville, E Brown.Subs: N Trainor, C Brown, R Brannigan, S McGreevy, P Lively, R Lively, T McGreevy, B McConville, P Wilson, J Boden, M McPolin, K OrsquoHagan, F McConville..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/13October2021_Co.jpg","title":"Co Down Rural Community opens new hub in Newcastle  ","story":"THE Co Down Rural Community Network has opened a new wellbeing hub in Newcastle.The new facility is intended to be a central point in the resort to make it easier for people to access information, advice and support and participate in activities to improve their mental and physical health and wellbeing.It will work with iniduals, community members, local groups, and multi-disciplinary teamsto identy community needs and facilitate better access to mental health and wellbeing training and resources.The opening of the new hub is the culmination of the Community Network working with local GPs and primary care teams and the wider community for over  years.Over the past three years, the network has linked up with the MDTs in the local primary care practices.The network has a team of social prescribers and an MDT coordinator who take referrals from GP practices, pharmacists and from other sources and find solutions for people who may be affected by physical limitations or mental health issues or who simply feel isolated in their own homes.This work has intensied during the Covid pandemic, making the opening of the hub even more timely.A total of  people have been referred by the local GPs and their teams to the Community Network since January this year in addition to the  clients that the Social Prescribing team have been working with since .Newry, Mourne and Down Council chairwoman Cathy Mason, who officially opened the news hub on Monday, has described it as a ldquogreat asset for the Community Network team and those who formerly operated a connect and chat service.ldquoGroups of all sorts now have a base to operate from in a beautul and peaceful location.

The project manager Mr Mike Gibb, said Delamont had always been his first option but he could no longer afford to wait on the council.Mr Gibbrsquos announcement dashes hopes that the centre, which is destined to become the largest owl and birds of prey rescue facility in Europe, would come to Killyleagh.Mr Gibb had entered negotiations with Down Council last year regarding the possible construction of the sanctuary at Delamont.But the project became the subject of controversial debates within the council chamber earlier this year amid accusations that council officials were dragging their heels about the proposal, leading Mr Gibb to look for alternative locations.CLOUGH ndash Residents opposing plans for the erection of a BT Cellnet mobile telephone mast in Clough have formed an action group to try and block the plan.At a meeting in the village on Monday, residents got together after they heard local environmentalist, Walter Graham, outlined the drawbacks and health risks associated with these masts.Plans for the -metre mast which,approved, will be sited within the Watsonrsquos filling station complex, were published several weeks ago andaccepted could be operating within months.Up to  residents gathered in the Old School House, just a stonersquos throw from the proposed site, to hear of the risks and implications these masts are believed to cause.Villagers heard how the transmitter could dominate the skyline, towering over homes, a primary school, petrol station and an old peoplersquos home.Claiming that scientists believed the growth of cancers were ldquospurred on by the transmitters, he said. ldquoIf this mast goes up my children are coming out of school, there is no way they will study in the shadow of that mast.

The Trust told us recently that the urgent care centre is lsquomeeting the needs of the publicrsquo but one really has to wonder how this opinion has been formed, said Mrs Trainor.Appealing for increased investment at the Downe site, health campaigners say that the hospital has the capability to do much more.The say the hospitalrsquos bed capacity must be extended to help meet the needs of local communities but also to help address the regional beds shortage caused by the large cut in capacity across Northern Ireland ldquowhich has been brutally exposed during the Covid crisis.The campaigners added: ldquoThe South Eastern Trust should now be looking at a large extension to the hospital, creating new capacity, away from over congested centralised sites, levelling up rural inequality in healthcare provision.

Villa had half chances too at the opposite end with Jake Wilson going close to an equaliser.Then came that dramatic finale. Wilson was presented with a second chance in the box after his initial effort was saved and he produced a stunning finish high into the net from a tight angle.Cue th minute pandemonium and it seemed the tie was set for extra time.But when the game was restarted Killyleagh won a corner and after two blocks at close range the ball was eventually scrambled over the line by Jon Joe Sharvin in the th minute.The huge crowd contained several former players from the first Killyleagh team to win the Border Cup in  and now Paul Sharvin will be hoping his team get a chance to match that Christmas glory.To reach the semi-finals, however, they must beat Crumlin United on November  ndash a chance to avenge an incredible - defeat when the teams last met in this competition exactly two yearsrsquo ago when Killyleagh tossed away a - half-time lead in the last nine minutes..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/13October2021_Slieve.jpg","title":"Slieve Donard sold for £40m  ","story":"NEWCASTLErsquoS iconic Slieve Donard Resort and Spa has been sold in a poundm deal to American investors.Owned by the Hastings family since , the world famous five-star hotel has been acquired by US-based AJ Capital Partners which is planning a major upgrade.After weeks of speculation that the hotel had been sold, the news was finally confirmed last Thursday with the new owner a Nashville-headquartered real estate developer and hotel operator with more than  hotels across the US and Britain, including St Andrews in Scotland.Announcing that the Newcastle hotel has been acquired, AJ Capital also confirmed that renovation work is planned to start in October next year, with the work completed by the following spring.During the planned upgrade, the hotel will remain closed.Howard Hastings mdash the managing director of Hastings Hotels mdash described AJ Capital Partnersrsquos acquisition of the Slieve Donard Resort and Spa as ldquoencouraging news for hospitality and tourism in Northern Ireland.He said it also represented a boost for the burgeoning golf tourism industry which ldquohas been an important driver of local tourism in recent years and shows signicant growth potential in the future.Mr Hastings added: ldquoI have every confidence that AJ Capital Partners will be sympathetic to the heritage of the hotel and that, under their leadership, it will continue to flourish and maintain its reputation as an iconic destination in Northern Ireland.ldquoThis investment is a strong sign of confidence in the local market by a major international hotel operator with exciting ambitions for the Slieve Donard in the coming years.

Concerns came not just from across the political spectrum but from groups including the Rural Community Network.”He added: “I am glad Nichola Mallon has taken this action, eventhe problem should never have arisen in the first place.”Sinn Fein MLA Cathal Boylan, meanwhile, have also welcomed the u-turn.“This was the right decision as the Minister’s plan was clearly out of step with the needs for rural communities,” he said.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

In other words, Ireland was partitioned in  for the same reasons Yugoslavia was partitioned in  – that is there was no basis for unity. In Belfast in May , Parnell delivered a speech in which he declared: “It is undoubtedly true … that until the prejudices of the minority, whether reasonable or unreasonable, are conciliated … Ireland can never enjoy perfect freedom, Ireland can never be united.”One may baulk at the word “prejudices” but the important point is that nationalists have never sought to put forward a prospectus that was remotely attractive to unionists.

These burrows were once part of a huge dune system that stretched all the way from the River Ogmore to the Gower peninsula and this area along with Kenfig is classed as a Site of Special Scientic Interest.With the dogs racing ahead enjoying their adventure and freedom, the narrow sandy paths adorned in places by the pretty Michaelmas-daisy led them through the burrows before turning southwards towards the coast.Reaching Kenfig Sands where the tide was on the ebb there were fantastic views south westwards towards Jersey Marine, Swansea Bay, Mumbles and Gower beyond as they settled down utilising washed up tree trunks as seating for morning refreshments in warm sunshine with a welcome breeze.Returning onto the coast path above the beach the group made their way eastwards to reach Sker Point with its fantastic long-distance views back across Kenfig Sands, spoiled only by the industrial smoke and buildings of Port Talbot Steelworks.Following the coastline soon the yellow painted Sker House came into view which signalled their lunch stop overlooking Sker Rocks which was the setting on April , , when the Samtampa a former Liberty ship was making its way up the Bristol Channel towards Newport in a south westerly gale. Developing an engine fault, the captain dropped anchor so repairs could begin, but the weather worsened to hurricane force winds, the ship slipped its anchor and was driven onto Sker Rocks. Mumbles leboat was launched to try to save the crew, but the Samtampa began to break up and all  of its crew drowned, along with the eight volunteer crew members of the Mumbles leboat which was later found upside down and smashed to pieces.     Continuing along the coast path with views across Rest Bay to Locks Common in Porthcawl and reaching the western perimeter of the Royal Porthcawl Golf Club, they ventured inland following a narrow path between fences, with a field of beautul Welsh Black cattle as the heat rose, before an open field brought them through a gate into Nottage.A short journey along the busy and fast-moving West Road brought them to a rough track opposite Parc Newydd Farm, which led them to overlook the impressive, imposing and dramatic Grade One listed Sker House, which was originally founded by the Cistercian monks of Neath as one of five farms or granges to support Neath Abbey. The house was remodelled by the Turberville family in the mid-th century after which it was tenanted and then sold to the Williams family in the late th century.This was when the romantic, heart rendering story of the lsquoMaid of Skerrsquo began involving Elizabeth Williams, an attractive young lady who loved to dance in the old Town Hall above the Prince of Wales Inn at Kenfig, where the music was supplied by a harpist.One evening the harpist was Thomas Evans and upon meeting they were smitten and fell in love. For a while he courted her, but her father was against the union as he felt being the daughter of a successful landowner and farmer, Thomas Evans was beneath her as he was a mere carpenter and so he imprisoned her in Sker House.The couple tried to elope, but their plans were thwarted and until Elizabeth agreed to marry her fatherrsquos choice of husband - Thomas Kirkwood of Neath - she was not freed. They married and had four children settling in Briton Ferry, but it was an unhappy liaison andher true love was playing in the area, Elizabeth would sneak out to hear him play. She died in , it is said of a broken heart, and was buried at Llansamlet, but her unfulfilled and unhappy ghost is said to still walk at Sker.Following a track and crossing part of the Pyle and Kenfig golf course brought them back to their start point after what had been a delightful scenic and interesting tramp through history in stunning weather for the month of October.You can follow the grouprsquos exploits at www.penarthramblers.wordpress or on Facebook. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

We have had great success with online bridge during the pandemic, but now we have reopened for Face-to-Face bridge our numbers are too small to be viable.Please come and support this historic club. However, letrsquos be positive. We are exploring merging our Tuesday and Friday evening sessions with another club.And,all fails, we will resume online bridge. Penarth Bridge Club will live on!So, here is a recent hand played at a Face-to-Face session where careful judgment by both declarer and the defence were required to achieve the optimum result.The AuctionNorth had seven spades and just seven points, ideal for a pre-emptive opening of three spades. The aim of pre-emptive bids is to put a spanner in the wheel of the defence.However, the danger always is that, as here, your partner has a good hand and so has a dficult decision to make on whether to pass or bid on for game. After some thought, South could see at least six spade tricks, evenhis partner did not have the king of spades.There were also two certain heart tricks, and it ought to be possible to rustle up a trick in diamonds and one more from Northrsquos hand. So, South bid four spades.The playTrick  ndash East was on lead and did not fancy a diamond or a club. And the jack of hearts lead was fraught with danger. So, interestingly, East chose to lead the five of spades, reasoning that his king was safe for a trickNorth held the ace.     And evenSouth held three spades to the ace, North must surely have an entry somewhere to take the spade finesse. Anyway, declarer paused to consider the hand.Without the trump lead the contract would have been secure as he could have ruffed a losing club in dummy. But now things were dficult.North decided to play the ace of spades, hoping to drop a singleton king in Westrsquos hand. But no luck. Tricks  and  ndash Declarer then played a club to his ace, followed by a small club from hand, the trick being won by Eastrsquos king.East was now quite pleased he had decided to lead a trump at the first trick. Trick  - East won the next trick with the king of spades, preventing declarer from ruffing his losing club.Trick  ndash East then led his ace of diamonds, which was ruffed by declarer in hand. Trick  ndash Declarer drew Eastrsquos last trump with his queen, discarding a heart from dummy. But he could now see he still had a losing club and a losing heart, one down, having already lost two tricks.But could there be a squeeze on  Tricks , ,  and  ndash Declarer then rattled off his last four spades, forcing four discards from both East and West. East could see that dummy had to discard before West, so he jettisoned his remaining four diamonds, keeping the jack of clubs and two hearts.Declarer decided to discard one more heart and the rest of dummyrsquos diamonds. West had to hope his partner East held the jack of clubs, otherwise he was genuinely squeezed. So, he discarded the rest of his clubs, keeping his three hearts to the queen.Declarer then played a small heart to dummyrsquos ace. He followed this with the king of hearts. Bad luck, Eastrsquos jack dropped but not Westrsquos queen. Trick  - West then won the last trick with his queen of hearts, declarer only making nine tricks - six spades, two hearts, and one club, one down for a loss of  points.Four spades was a perfectly reasonable bid by South. But well done by the defence for the opening lead and care in their discards.What have we learnt . areful judgement is needed when responding to partnerrsquos opening pre-emptive bid, particularly when non vulnerable, since the pre-emptive bid is likely to be quite weak.. Sometimes it can quite be safe to lead a trump from three to king, as here.Penarth club resultsFriday  October: . Joy Seculer and Mike Downey. Peter Craig and Sean Macdougall.

In the UK, the Government legislated in June  that the UK must reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions by , by mandating a % cut in emissions by that date.That requires deep cuts in emissions and therefore changes in all sectors, including how we heat our homes, how we travel, our power sector, how industry uses energy and even our diets, and efforts to capture some emissions. vw,vw,px, px\"How landscapes can catch carbon The statutory advisory Climate Change Committeehas said it expects more than  million tonnes of emissions will be captured in  to offset the pollution the UK is still putting out then.Ways to do that include burning plant matter for energy and capturing and burying the carbon emissions, known as BECCS, technology that captures carbon dioxide directly from the air, expanding woodlands and restoring peatlands.Delivering net zero is not without controversy, with concerns raised about the cost.But the CCC has concluded it would cost less than % of GDP through the next  years to deliver, and would bring benefits such as cleaner air, better health and provide a jobs boost, though there is a need to ensure the costs are spread fairly.It is also controversial because some environmentalists are concerned some companies and governments think they can continue to pollute while ldquooffsetting themselves out of the crisis, instead of tackling the emissions at source.However, the CCCrsquos chief executive Chris Stark has said setting a net zero target is the right approach, and the goal has galvanised action.He said it was dferent from the UKrsquos old target of % emissions cut by  because there was no longer a % of residual pollution that organisations or sectors thought they could emit.ldquoI see real progress having set net zero as a goal, not just in government circles and in policy, but crucially in the commercial sector, he said..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Net zero: what is it and why does it matter  article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Northern Ireland has experienced a .% increase in average rental values this year[]. With the price increase, OFTEC, representing the liquid fuel industry in Ireland, is concerned that students may take cheaper accommodation options without properly inspecting the property. With this in mind, OFTEC has issued advise to help students ensure their accommodation is safe before they sign the dotted line. Raise the alarm – Currently, it is not a mandatory requirement for private landlords to provide smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, but the HSENI recommend that they do. It is a legal requirement to fit a carbon monoxide detector when a fossil fuel appliance has been replaced. Carbon monoxide is potentially lethal as it has no smell, taste or colour. Without a working alarm, it is impossible to identy carbon monoxide leaks. OFTEC’s advise is to ensure that there are working fire and CO alarms in the property, and that they are tested on a regular basis.Heating requirements - The Health  Safety Executive recommend that all boilers should be serviced annually and tenants should ask for evidence of recent servicing. If you have concerns, ask for a CD  Landlord Oil Installation Check which is carried out by an OFTEC registered technician and will give you peace of mind. For a gas heated property, ask for a copy of the annual gas safety check.Look for damp – It is easy to hide damp patches with a coat of paint, soyour house smells musty or you see evidence of mould, find out how the landlord is planning to fix the problem. Mould has no place in the home as it can cause respiratory problems and headaches.Furniture and fittings – Ask the landlord for a list of everything that is included and make note of any damage that is there before you move it. Check any beds, sofas and chairs are in good condition.Secure your home – burglars may target student areas because of lax security. Ask your landlord to fit key operating locks on the windows and lever deadlocks on external doors.  OFTEC Ireland Manager, David Blevings, said: “Quite often the excitement of moving in with friends can overshadow the concerns about the accommodation itself. We are urging students to play it safe this year and carry out these essential checks before signing a lease and moving in. “Asking a landlord about safety may seem awkward, but it could prevent you from living in a potentially dangerous property for the next  months. It’s vital that your new home is not a burden as you start your time at university.
