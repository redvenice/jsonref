A modern survey of submariners, designed to tackle high turnover, suggested the rules on wearing the jumpers should be relaxedAnd the items could even be treated as trophies, handed out to recruits after they pass their submarine training.The merino wool sweaters, which cost £70, form an important part of the submariners’ image, not least because of their appearance in heroic war movies such as the 1955 classic Above Us The Waves starring John Mills.Submariners suggested the rules be relaxed when quizzed as part of an internal report designed to tackle high turnover among the 5,000 members of the so-called Silent Service, which has traditionally been attributed to the isolation of spending up to 90 days at a time below the surface.The senior officer who compiled the report, a Commander Grey, said: ‘The traditional wearing of white jumpers is perhaps seen as more popular for the submariner and its wider use is encouraged.’Police launch investigation into Prince Philip crash as it\u0027s...Share this articleHe suggests that senior officers should ‘amend regulations to permit the regular wearing of white submariner jumpers within naval bases. Every submariner should be given a jumper on completion of their basic submarine qualification, along with their Dolphins’ – the coveted lapel badge they earn.Cdr Grey’s report, based on three months of research and originally classified as ‘sensitive’, was released by the Ministry of Defence following a Freedom of Information request.It suggests a number of measures to help stem the loss of personnel, including cash bonuses, tax-free pay for secret missions, better meals, handing out more medals and hiring cleaners to take out rubbish after long underwater missions.          The jumpers were also worn in heroic war films, including Above Us The Waves.

In messages seen by The Mail on Sunday, Mark Francois vowed ‘never to stand for it’, while Zac Goldsmith raged: ‘Love to know what promises we would be standing on’, while John Howell said ‘we need this like a hole in the head’.Maria Caulfield added: ‘My volunteers are on their knees and so fed up with the parliamentary party. They really can’t take much more.’This week Mrs May faces a fresh battle with the House of Commons as Remainers led by Nick Boles and Dominic Grieve unleash a fresh bout of procedure warfare in a bid to wrestle control of Brexit policy from the Government.In an incendiary development a leaked draft of a bill proposed by Mr Grieve would allow a minority of just 300 MPs to seize control of Commons business if it was passed and dictate what the Government must do, in a move one critic branded ‘constitutional arson.’However, Labour whips have yet to decide if they will back the move to neuter the Government.A source said: ‘We could be in power within months in a minority government, is this really the best time to rip up the rulebook?’A Downing Street spokesman said it was ‘totally untrue’ that Mrs May’s allies had discussed a deal under which she would resign by May.  Inside the Brexit bash where Jacob Rees Mogg\u0027s son Peter, 11, served Bollinger to the crowing Tory rebels               Jacob Rees-Mogg (pictured left)with his 11-year-old son Peter (right), dressed in the red breeches of his £15,000-a-year London prep school, who served drinksA spur of the moment champagne soirée at the £5.6 million Westminster townhouse of Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg was compared to ‘something out of The Great Gatsby’ as the party host was missing for most of the evening.Just moments after inflicting a thundering defeat on Theresa May’s EU deal on Tuesday evening, the Brexit stalwart invited dozens of Tory colleagues to his home just 300 yards from the House of Commons to raise a glass, but they ended up raiding his kitchen.And like F. Scott Fitzgerald’s lavish anti-hero, who throws parties for his guests but stays mysteriously out of view, the North East Somerset MP was across the road at the BBC’s television studios giving interviews.Instead it fell to Mr Rees-Mogg’s 11-year-old son Peter, dressed in the red breeches of his £15,000-a-year London prep school, to serve £45 bottles of Bollinger to jubilant MPs.Invitations to the bash were sent via a WhatsApp messaging group for Leave-backing MPs, with the Who’s Who of the Tory Right –including former Cabinet Ministers Boris Johnson, Iain Duncan Smith and John Whittingdale – attending.The Mail on Sunday understands that as the champagne flowed, hungry guests raided the Rees-Mogg family fridge and even emptied his biscuit tin.      Jacob Rees-Mogg talks with anti-Brexit protester outside the Houses of Parliament ahead of a vote on Prime Minister Theresa May\u0027s Brexit dealAs The Mail on Sunday revealed last May, Mr Rees-Mogg’s Tory critics suspected that he would use the five-storey mansion as his ‘own No 10’ in the heart of Westminster in order to further his suspected leadership ambitions.But he insisted he bought the 18th Century building ‘because I have six children’. Meanwhile, Tory Remainers were in similarly jubilant spirits, gathering on the House of Commons Terrace for their own celebration after the result sent shockwaves through Downing Street.Pro-EU ringleader Dominic Grieve was seen sharing a pint of beer with Labour MPs after 118 Tory Brexiteers and Remainers united to give Mrs May the largest ever defeat for a government in parliamentary history, voting down her deal by 432 votes to 202.  Back Theresa May rather than lose Brexit: JACOB REES MOGG says the Tories must come together in the national interest             Jacob Rees-Mogg (pictured): \u0027there was no rejoicing at the scale of the Prime Minister’s defeat, no revelling in her humiliation\u0027After the overwhelming defeat of Theresa May’s Brexit deal last week, I hosted an impromptu meeting for like-minded Tory MPs at my London house.We were discussing over drinks the Commons’ decisive vote against a proposal that would have been damaging for this country.However, there was no rejoicing at the scale of the Prime Minister’s defeat, no revelling in her humiliation. I would have preferred a smaller margin.Yes, we were happy that a proposal that would not have delivered Brexit had been comprehensively finished off.Yet Tuesday’s vote, large as it was, only closed off one course of action. It did not solve the key question of how we deliver Brexit and honour the verdict of the 2016 referendum.It did not in one bound provide a satisfactory Brexit deal.Mrs May reacted to her setback by opening talks with the Opposition parties to discuss possible changes to her proposals. That is a most statesmanlike approach.            At the Commons: the powerful ERG chairman said that Mrs May reacted to her setback with a most statesmanlike approachHowever, in my unequivocal view the answer to this crisis still remains largely within the Prime Minister’s own party. This is why.As much as reaching out to Europhile Labour MPs may look attractive, only winning over her Tory rebels will get Mrs May over the line.The simple arithmetic is that more than 110 Tory MPs and ten DUP MPs voted against Mrs May’s deal last week.If they change sides, she wins.Therefore, the energy of the negotiations to improve her deal must be with us and not with Labour MPs such as Yvette Cooper who cannot provide her with anything like the additional 115 MPs needed to reverse the result.            Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg leaves his house in Westminster in LondonThen the question remains: what type of deal would we be willing to accept? What needs to be changed? The biggest obstacles within the Prime Minister’s current deal are the backstop and the £39 billion we currently propose to give to Brussels but for which we get nothing in return.If Mrs May can persuade the EU to show flexibility on these, we could get the deal through the Commons.Most people in Parliament want a deal.There are very few MPs who have adopted no deal as an article of faith. I have never been among them.Here I must stress that reports I have gone soggy on Brexit are, as they say, exaggerated to the point of untruth.If I had to choose between no deal and Mrs May’s original accord, I would have no hesitation of opting for no-deal Brexit but even Mrs May’s deal would be better than not leaving at all.Even at this very late stage, I believe that with commitment and effort we can avoid such a choice.I hope that if Mrs May were prepared to compromise on her plans, she could win over her party, get a revised deal through the Commons and secure agreement from Brussels.It is high time for the Tory Party to come together in the national interest. "},{"url":null,"title":"How 12 different female reporters featured 18 times three BBC News","story":"    Last Sunday\u0027s lunchtime edition was anchored by Carole Walker and featured three women reporters  Political reporter Susana Mendonca (left) reports on Brexit at 1.01pm followed by business reporter Joe Miller (right) on trade after Brexit  At 1.06pm North of England correspondent Fiona Trott at the scene of a hit-and-run crash in Manchester.

It is undoubtedly an incredible feat for medical science that such complex surgery is possibleIt had been five long years since the catastrophic day Corinne, 48, lost her hands and feet to sepsis five years of prosthetics and pain during which she has had to overhaul her entire life. In truth, she is lucky to be alive at all.But today, the results of the painstaking, 12-hour procedure at Leeds General Infirmary, which involved four teams of highly specialised surgeons, are already astonishing the doctors – and, indeed, their patient.Corinne can barely stop staring at her new hands with wonder. ‘It’s all been worth it,’ she says, tearfully. ‘Even now, with all the pains, aches, the medication, the lack of sleep. I can’t stop looking at them. They’re absolutely fantastic.          She had to undergo extensive screening to assess her psychological and physical suitability to face the demanding surgery. Only a small number of amputees are accepted as potential recipients – and it was Corinne’s positive attitude which flagged her as ideal‘But the one thing I want to do more than anything now is hold my son’s hand properly.‘Since he was four, he’s had to hold what’s been left of my hands. He’s ten now and he might not be very keen on the idea of holding his mum’s hand, but I’m going to do it anyway – because I haven’t been able to do it for so long.’It is undoubtedly an incredible feat for medical science that such complex surgery is possible.It has not been an easy journey. Former graphic designer Corinne has not only had to come to terms with life as a quadruple amputee, but endured an additional personal tragedy when her marriage fell apart along the way. Her husband left, unable it seems to cope with her disabilities and, when asked if he has been in touch to congratulate her on the operation, she simply shakes her head.Still, her sense of determination has not diminished. She has raised her young son as a single parent and channelled her energies into launching her own charity for amputees, Finding Your Feet.In an extraordinary display of human endeavour, she also climbed Mount Kilimanjaro last October using prosthetic limbs.Today, however, her thoughts are with the family of the 51-year-old donor whose hands have given her life fresh hope. Remarkably, thanks to the skills of the surgeons and the team which matches donors to patients, they already feel like her own.But she is keenly aware that her happy story of success is the result of another family’s tragedy. ‘I hope her family can take some comfort and consolation from the fact that her hands will change my life,’ she says.           Corinne and her son Rory are pictured before this month\u0027s surgery. She said: ‘But the one thing I want to do more than anything now is hold my son’s hand properly. ‘Since he was four, he’s had to hold what’s been left of my hands. He’s ten now and he might not be very keen on the idea of holding his mum’s hand, but I’m going to do it anyway – because I haven’t been able to do it for so long\u0027‘The family’s personal loss is horrendous, the worst thing in the world, but I will be forever filled with gratitude. These hands are destined for great things.’ Indeed, Corinne is lucky to be alive at all.In June 2013, the 48-year-old, from Lochwinnoch, near Glasgow, had been in otherwise good health when she developed a persistent, hacking cough, and was prescribed antibiotics.But after feeling increasingly unwell, she went to A\u0026ampE at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, where she collapsed and spent three weeks in a medically induced coma, suffering from pneumonia.At one point, her chances of survival were just five per cent.Her hands and feet turned black and, when she came round, she was devastated to learn that she would became a quadruple amputee.But from the beginning, there was hope that her hands, at least, could be replaced.Two leading plastic surgeons, Professor Simon Kay at Leeds, who performed the UK’s first single hand transplant in 2012, and Professor Andrew Hart in Glasgow, who amputated her hands and feet, agreed she was an ideal candidate for transplant surgery. \u0027All I want for my birthday... is to DIE\u0027: Heartbreak as...Mother-of-seven, 34, dies at her home from rare genetic...Share this articleShe had to undergo extensive screening to assess her psychological and physical suitability to face the demanding surgery. Only a small number of amputees are accepted as potential recipients – and it was Corinne’s positive attitude which flagged her as ideal.Those waiting for a limb, however, face even greater problems than those requiring an organ. Donor and patient must be the same gender and ethnicity, with the same skin type and tone. The hands must also be the same size as the ones which have been lost.Corinne’s case posed further complexities in that she received 25 different blood transfusions during her battle with sepsis, which left her with a wide range of different antibodies in her system. To get by, she was fitted with a bionic glove to tackle complicated tasks such as hair brushing and making a cup of tea. The call to confirm a match could come at any time and a hospital bag was always packed and waiting.But it was crushing to endure regular false alarms – when her surgical team thought they had a donor but they turned out not to be a suitable match.          Former graphic designer Corinne has not only had to come to terms with life as a quadruple amputee, but endured an additional personal tragedy when her marriage fell apart along the way. Her husband left, unable it seems to cope with her disabilities and, when asked if he has been in touch to congratulate her on the operation, she simply shakes her headCorinne said: ‘I’m a positive person but I had started to think it would never happen to me. In the beginning, my heart raced when I got the phone call, thinking it was all about to happen but then there were 12 false alarms that I knew about and another eight that the hospital team didn’t tell me about.’It was agonising when the first double hand transplant took place in July 2016 – on another patient. Chris King, 58, from Doncaster, lost both hands in a work accident. There have been two further doubles since, including the UK’s first woman, Tanya Jackson, 42, from Hull.Having lost both hands and her left arm to sepsis, the mother-of-three put herself forward for the operation after watching a TV documentary on Corinne’s case.‘I saw other people getting the surgery and, while I was happy for them, I was starting to think after five years that maybe I should just be happy with my lot,’ continues Corinne.‘I thought, “Do I really want to go through this again and start from scratch?” I had begun setting myself up for disappointment. I loathed my stumps but, together with my bionic glove and my prosthetic legs, I’d become completely self-sufficient. For me, getting new hands was always the difference between being able to use buttons and zips or hold my son’s hand or run my fingers through his hair.‘In the end, I had no option but to leave it to fate.’It was during this long, frustrating period that her marriage also ended. Corinne admits it was ‘never a marriage made in heaven’.But her deep anger at the collapse of her relationship and feelings of rejection as she struggled to rebuild her life and her confidence, clearly still hurt. There is little she wants to say on the matter. While her son Rory maintains a good relationship with his father, her own dealings with her ex remain ‘distant’.          In an extraordinary display of human endeavour, she also climbed Mount Kilimanjaro last October using prosthetic limbs. Today, however, her thoughts are with the family of the 51-year-old donor whose hands have given her life fresh hopeThe call that would change her life came on the evening of Monday January 7. The team at Leeds told her they believed they had a possible match and advised her to stand by. ‘At first, I tried not to believe it,’ she says. ‘But this time they seemed pretty certain. I was at home with Rory and I said, “Mummy might be getting new hands after all.”‘When the call came that it was happening and an ambulance was on its way for me, we all kicked into automatic pilot. Silly things go through your head, though. I made sure I emptied the washing machine and put notes everywhere with instructions for things I hadn’t had time to do, like return parcels.’Corinne made the 240-mile journey alone, leaving Rory with her brother. By the time she arrived at Leeds General Infirmary at 3.30am, a team of 12 surgeons – led by Prof Kay – was beginning to assemble, including one from Lyon, in France.They would only find out in theatre how viable Corinne’s own wrists and nerve endings were, which would affect how much of the donor’s own limbs they used. But the team were ‘excited’ and the general atmosphere was ‘amazing’, Corinne recalls.The surgery began at 1pm on January 8 and finished in the early hours of the following morning.When Corinne woke, her stumps had gone, replaced by a pair of new hands and wrists, after the surgeons decided the scar tissue in her own wrists was too great.‘It was absolutely phenomenal. Looking at them for the first time, I was full of wonder. They’ve done a wonderful job and the fact I have the donor’s wrists too means I’m already able to move my fingers.’          It had been five long years since the catastrophic day Corinne, 48, lost her hands and feet to sepsis five years of prosthetics and pain during which she has had to overhaul her entire life. In truth, she is lucky to be alive at allThere were emotional moments.‘I remember my brother saying, “Look, you’ve got hands!” and I was like “I do! I’ve got hands!” I didn’t instantly think, “They’re not mine.”‘But that’s the whole point of the psychological counselling. The idea is you wake up and eventually, or so I thought, you come round to the idea that they’re yours. If they looked wrong, that wouldn’t work. But I loved them straight away.’The level of expertise involved throughout the entire process was breathtaking, as Corinne learned.‘As two teams – one for each hand – opened up my wrists, two retrieval teams were working on the donor. Speed is of the essence as, unlike organs which can be kept for some hours, hands begin to die the minute circulation stops. Professor Hart, who removed my original hands, had tucked a lot of the nerves away to preserve them, which meant they could make very long joins and weave things like tendons all through which makes them much stronger than a joint, so they are delighted with that.’ She adds, with a laugh: ‘I did remember to say goodbye to my stumps and I now feel a bit bad that I was so dismissive of them.‘I will always be grateful to them but these are so much better. What I’ve got essentially is two perfect hands on two perfect arms.’There is still the chance, despite taking immunosuppressant drugs for the rest of her life, that her body could reject the new appendages. If that happens, they may have to be removed.But so far, her recovery has been more successful than even the doctors had hoped. On day two, she wiggled her fingers. Corinne puts it partially down to being advised, following her amputation, to frequently imagine she could play piano.She hasn’t ever played the instrument but – mentally, at least – she’s now a concert pianist.‘The point was to keep the muscles and tendons in my arms in good shape,’ she explains. ‘You have to imagine moving every inidual finger – even though you just have a stump. I could feel every single nerve and I was made to work at that.          Corinne is pictured with her son Rory when she first contracted sepsis. In June 2013, the 48-year-old, from Lochwinnoch, near Glasgow, had been in otherwise good health when she developed a persistent, hacking cough, and was prescribed antibiotics. But after feeling increasingly unwell, she went to A\u0026ampE at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, where she collapsed and spent three weeks in a medically induced coma, suffering from pneumonia‘I do wonder if the fact I’ve been able to wiggle my fingers already is because of it. I did it religiously. I never could play piano but in my head I’m now great at it.‘Moving the fingers feels as you would expect but I’m having to really concentrate. Hopefully, eventually, it will just become normal muscle memory.’Corinne will receive physiotherapy three times a week to build dexterity, but sensation may take another 18 months. She has already experienced occasional ‘shooting pain’ through her hands but this is a normal reaction of the tendons adjusting to their new systems.A physiotherapist, massaging her fingers as we chat, remarks that Corinne’s new digits would look lovely with a wedding ring. ‘I’ve tried it,’ Corinne quips dryly. ‘I liked being married but unfortunately he didn’t feel the same.’Later this week she will return home to be reunited with son Rory, who has spoken to her excitedly every day over FaceTime.Tearfully, Corinne says: ‘He wants to see I’m all right. Apart from that, life goes on as normal for him. I’ve held up my new hands to show him and he’s very taken with them but then, like any ten-year-old, he quickly loses interest and goes off to do something else.’She also hopes, at some point, to be able to meet the family of the woman whose hands she now calls her own. The woman’s major organs have also gone on to save the lives of others around the country.She plans to write a letter, not only to her donor’s family but to the specialist organ donation nurses whose job it is to persuade families to consider the commitment.‘I will thank the nurses for persevering and not giving up on me. Recipients are not told anything about the donor but I would like to meet her family one day, even hold their hands if they will allow it.‘The donor family might never want to know but, if I could, I would like to tell them face to face that I will make this hand transplant worthwhile.‘As long as they know I’m full of gratitude and I’ve made my vow to put their loved one’s hands to great use, I’m happy with that.’"},{"url":null,"title":"Esther McVey erupted Amber Rudd Commons spat took job","story":"    Brexit bust-up?

Yousafzai explains why she was driven to tell the stories of other displaced girls• ‘I never thought I’d see land again’: read an extract from We Are Displaced“People have heard my story already,” says Malala Yousafzai, the youngest ever Nobel laureate, in something of an understatement. “I thought it was time for people to listen to other girls’ stories as well.” Her new book, We Are Displaced is a collection of harrowing, heartbreaking and ultimately inspiring first-person accounts of the lives of girls Yousafzai has met in her travels to refugee camps and settlements across the world. “We hear about refugees in the newspapers, on TV, and it is just in numbers, and it’s usually in a negative way. But we do not hear from them, especially when it comes to young women and girls. So I wrote the book.”Yousafzai’s story – shot by the Taliban in Peshawar in 2012, when she was 15, for speaking out for the rights of girls to go to school – is surely one of the best known in the world today, and was recounted in the international bestseller I Am Malala, written with the journalist Christina Lamb. As she tells it, in the comfort of a discreetly guarded London hotel room, one minute she was on the school bus with her friends talking about the following day’s exams, the next she was “opening my eyes in this hospital in Birmingham and people were speaking in English”. She was deaf in one ear and the left side of her face was badly damaged where the bullet had narrowly missed her eye, but she was lucky to be alive.After she recovered, rather than retreating into anonymity and GCSEs, she stepped up to a role as a global ambassador for female education. On her 16th birthday in July 2013 she gave an address to the UN, which declared the event “Malala Day”, and she appeared on the cover of that year’s Time magazine’s 100 Most Influential People in the World issue (she was on the list three years running). She has joined the ranks of those so famous they are called only by their first names, and is herself on first-name terms with politicians and celebrities (“Angelina was the highlight”). Not to mention being awarded the Nobel peace prize in 2014. Here was a remarkable story and a young woman the world could celebrate – Malala, a sort of modern-day saint. But, on the dull January morning that we meet, this chatty 21-year-old Oxford undergraduate, in a bright pink headscarf and tunic, seems to have her feet firmly on the ground, albeit in a pair of impressively high heels for 10am. The only external sign of her injuries is a slightly lopsided smile, which she gives often.If there has been criticism, or cynicism, directed towards Yousafzai (in Pakistan there has been a great deal, even including theories suggesting she faked being shot), it is in the idea that she is in some way a creation – of the west, of her father, the education activist Ziauddin Yousafzai, of the media. Others complain that she has been absorbing too much attention (she was accused on social media, she says in I Am Malala, of having “a teen lust for fame”) when so many young Pakistanis, and children around the world, have suffered. So it is fitting that in her first big project since receiving the Nobel (which she likens to being “in a car, rather than a bike” in terms of the reach of her activism), she uses her name to make known those of others – Zaynab, Muzoon, Najla – who might otherwise have been ignored.She began work on it more than five years ago in the Syrian refugee camps in Jordan, which she was visiting as part of her Malala Fund for girls’ education. It was not possible for Yousafzai to meet all of the women in person, such as Ajida, a young mother from Rohingya, but she felt it was important to include the crisis in Myanmar. While we are sadly all too familiar with the humanitarian catastrophes of Syria and Iraq, she wanted to draw attention to the fact “that this is happening literally in every corner of the world. It’s happening in Latin America, it’s happening in south-east Asia, it’s happening in south Asia, it’s happening in most parts of Africa.” She wanted to show “how big and broad this issue is”.While she says it is hard to single out one story, the ordeal endured by Marie Claire – whose family fled the Democratic Republic of Congo when she was nine, only for her mother to be murdered in front of her by an anti-refugee hate mob in Zambia – is impossible to forget. When she was 16, Marie Claire received news that the visa for which her mother had applied 10 years earlier had finally been accepted: the family were moving to Lancaster, Pennsylvania, “the refugee capital” of the United States. On 16 June 2016, when she was 19, she graduated from high school, the first person in her family ever to do so. “My heart was full and cracked at once,” she writes. “This was my mother’s dream, too. She should have been here to experience it with me.”In the story of 16-year-old Sabreen, forced to leave Yemen and then Egypt, we learn what it really means to try to cross the Mediterranean in an overcrowded fishing boat, and in the plight of Guatemalan orphan Analisa, held in the detention centres, known as the “ice box” and the “dog pound”, on the Mexican border, the cruelty of Trump’s immigration policy becomes all too real.“We can’t imagine being in a car and going from Birmingham to London on our own when we are 14 or 15,” Yousafzai says. “Our parents would be worried about us. And these girls walk for days and nights, all on their own, some are getting in buses with strangers, going through all the security things, not knowing if they will be safe or not.” As the book makes clear, even after surviving perilous journeys, girls are too often greeted with hostility (“We were truly being treated like animals” is a common refrain), their futures far from certain. “They are putting their lives at risk and I think this is actual courage and bravery,” says Yousafzai, herself often called “the bravest girl in the world”.She is keen to stress the distinction between being displaced, forced to move within your own country, and becoming a refugee, hence the book’s title: “I called it ‘displaced’ because the majority of people are internally displaced rather than refugees. In total there are 68.5 million people who are displaced and only around 24 million are refugees. And I myself became displaced in Pakistan, plus 2 million other people.”In May 2009, several months after the Taliban forbade girls from going to school in Peshawar, Yousafzai’s family left their home in Mingora: it “felt like having my heart ripped out”, she writes. Although they were able to return after three months, their greatest fear was that they “would be displaced for ever”. Even as a 12-year-old, Yousafzai says she knew that the home she was returning to “no longer existed except in my dreams” – a feeling echoed by Maria in the book, who has moved eight times within Colombia, from one makeshift camp to another, but has “never felt ‘at home’ in any other place than the one I keep alive in my head from when I was a child”. Then, after the shooting in 2012, Yousafzai’s family had to leave their country for ever. “We were plucked from our mountain valley in Swat, Pakistan, and transported to a brick house in Birmingham,” she writes in the preface to I Am Malala. Technically, she explains, they are not refugees, but residents in the UK: “For me it is more than becoming a refugee, it is about displacement, losing your home.”The “paradox” of the immigrant experience, as the Pennsylvania volunteer who becomes Marie Claire’s “American mom” describes it, is to be “grateful for a new life that is based on the painful loss of an old one”. “Oftentime” Yousafzai observes, in a quaint expression she uses frequently, “we forget about how the refugees also want to go back to their home. Every girl has this dream – they want to see their home, they feel this kind of incompletion in their life.” For her, “home has this sense of belonging. When you become a refugee you feel like you are a stranger to the land, an outsider. But as soon as you feel like you belong you are an insider and you deserve an equal right to it as anyone else. This becomes your home. And you can have many homes.”With its snow-capped mountains and pine forests, the Swat valley is known as “the Switzerland of the east” – “We think it is better than Switzerland,” she says. While Yousafzai is “very proud of Birmingham”, which she now regards as her second home, she still misses the sounds and smells and tastes of Peshawar: sweet tea boiled on the stove, her mother’s chicken and rice, somehow “tastier” back home, sharing jokes with her friends – “The English sense of humour is different,” she says diplomatically. And she will never get used to the weather (although she ruefully concedes that “summers are getting better, probably because of global warming”) or the fact that drivers don’t honk their horns all the time: before she came to the UK she “had never seen people following traffic rules”.Of course it is not just Malala, but her parents and younger brothers Atal and Khushal who have been uprooted. It has been particularly difficult for her mother, Toor Peksi, whose homesickness was “horrible” at first. It is getting better, Yousafzai says. “She is happier”, and has made friends with her English teacher, with whom she enjoys a cup of tea. For her mother, getting the lift to the ninth floor of their first Birmingham flat was as terrifying “as boarding a space ship” she was bothered by the nightclubs on the street where they lived and the fact that the girls didn’t seem to wear many clothes, even in winter. “It didn’t make sense to her – it’s snowing and these girls are not covering their legs. My mum used to say, ‘I wish I had the same legs as them’,” she laughs.Yousafzai was lonely at school, the unfamiliar woolly tights not the only thing making her uncomfortable: “I used to just look at everybody who was talking and laughing and think, should I go and talk to them or not, should I join their gossip or not? Sometimes I thought, OK, I should just go to the library and read a book.” On the day her Nobel was announced she was in a chemistry lesson. The deputy head teacher called her out of the class to tell her she had won. Then she went back to her desk.Last March the family made their first trip back to Pakistan since the shooting, her father always worried that elections or other political events would make it dangerous. “I realised we would never find the right time, there’s always something happening,” she says. “So it is just better to go now. I was quite stubborn.” They met hundreds of their extended family and friends – “lots of selfies and lots of hugs and prayers and kisses” – including her childhood best friend and academic rival Moniba, who is now studying medicine. They visited Swat, “the weather was nice”, and returned to their old home, where the family who now live there have kept her room just as it was: “my school trophies and drawings and books and cupboard and bed and everything. It was such a beautiful time.”Now she is in her second year studying philosophy, politics and economics at Oxford, something she dreamed of back in Pakistan as a child. She is at Lady Margaret Hall, founded as one of the first female colleges, where her hero Benazir Bhutto, the former Pakistani prime minister who was assassinated in 2007, also studied PPE. She is having fun and “just living a bit of normal life”. Is that possible? “In Oxford there are a few famous people already there, so we don’t feel very famous,” she says (she’s too diplomatic to name names). She has made good friends: “They don’t treat me as ‘the Malala’, but just their friend Malala.” She was given a hard time after someone posted a photo of her wearing a pair of skinny jeans online but, “It’s just jeans, what’s wrong with jeans?” she asks breezily, “I just don’t care about those things.”Does she never suffer from self-doubt or anxiety? “It depends what we are talking about,” she says. “It is a challenge for girls to believe in themselves and to believe that they can do anything, oftentime they become a hurdle to themselves. There are external challenges, but there are also internal challenges, we give up at the external ones and we say, ‘OK fine, maybe I’m not capable of becoming a scientist or prime minister or an astronaut or something.’ I think it is important that at first girls develop that confidence in themselves and then together we will fight the external challenges.”She was “surprised” to discover that sexism can still be found in the UK. “We consider the west as the perfect world where there is equality and democracy,” she says. “When you talk about the so-called developing countries, the issues are more visible and people talk about them openly. But in the west this is something that is happening, but is often not talked about.” The fact that women are speaking out about sexual harassment with the #MeToo movement, and against the gender pay gap, sends a message to “women working in Pakistan or India or Brazil. It is empowering for everyone to see that women in the west are also joining them.”Does she still want to become the next prime minister of Pakistan? “I was very little!” she says, in the way of someone who is often asked the same thing (anyone who has watched the 2009 New York Times documentary Class Dismissed can’t help but wonder if perhaps this preternaturally articulate child might one day fulfil her ambition). And PPE students do have a habit of going on to run the world. “People always focus on the politics. It’s also philosophy and it’s also economics,” she reminds me. No, she doesn’t have any plans or interest in politics, right now, she says. But who knows in 15 or 20 years?She feels she can make more of a difference through the Malala Fund, which she wants to “make even bigger”, setting her sights on more than 1 million girls, most of them refugees or displaced, who are out of school.Like a true politician, she will not be drawn on which of the prime ministers or presidents that she has met, from Gordon Brown to Barack Obama, has most impressed her. “It’s not that I don’t like them or anything. But it is politics and you do not agree with everything they say.” She is currently reading Michelle Obama’s memoir Becoming. And though she hasn’t met Trump, she hopes he will read her book. “It’s an easy read,” she shoots back, when I point out he’s not a big reader. “He could tweet it,” she laughs. More seriously, she says she would invite him to visit a refugee camp. “I could help him to organise that.”On the day we meet, she is taking part in a Live event at the Barbican in London. All her family are gathered in the green room – her teenage brothers presiding over snacks and pastries. The event has sold out, yet still feels lively and intimate, with teachers and friends from Oxford in the audience. When the chair asks if Yousafzai ever felt too afraid to speak out, she replies that she was more scared about what would happen if nobody did. But she does admit to being frightened of animals: “I hope things will be better one day,” she jokes, and she brings the house down with her best Brummie accent. Questions from the floor come from fans, girls and boys, one as young as nine. At the end she gets a standing ovation.“Sometimes we think about refugees as the victims,” she tells me. “That they must have sad stories, and they are sad indeed, but they also show us how much courage they have and how brave they are.” Despite the horrors, We Are Displaced is also hopeful: many of the girls featured are now studying for degrees. “These young girls are activists. They have dreams for their futures.” As she says, “If one girl with an education can change the world, what can 130 million do?” • We Are Displaced is published by Weidenfeld \u0026amp Nicolson.

She finished her debut novel, A Girl Is a Half-Formed Thing, in 2004, but it took nine years for it to be published. It won the 2013 Goldsmiths prize and the 2014 Baileys women’s prize for fiction. Her second novel, The Lesser Bohemians (2016), won the 2017 James Tait Black memorial prize. McBride takes part in Imagining Ireland at the Barbican, London on 30 January.This was the best piece of theatre I’ve seen in a long time. It’s about a family who go off on a holiday and it’s only over time you realise that the children are actually playing the adults and the adults are the children. One of the parents is terminally ill, and the play opens with this beautiful play the children put on for them, which is just this gorgeous, imaginative feast. There’s a heartbreaking and hilarious moment where you realise that someone who has always been spoken to quite brusquely was in fact the dog.He is a wonderful Scottish folk musician and he played at the Wanstead Tap in east London, a little venue round the corner from where I live. He writes so beautifully the music really goes through you. He’s got this very quiet, unassuming charisma – he’s completely magnetic to watch. It was just him and his guitar. It was completely stripped down and the place was packed to the rafters, but you could have heard a pin drop: everyone was completely hypnotised by him. I really love his album A Wonder Working Stone – that’s my favourite.I loved looking at how she dealt with her body, given that it was such a huge part of her art. It was interesting to see the items she owned: a beautiful prosthetic leg, and an amazing plaster of Paris corset she had to wear after innumerable, horrific and often unsuccessful operations on her back, which she then painted herself – she created art out of her own physical distress. Focusing on women’s clothes and makeup often becomes about objectifying, but she subverted that.This was an interesting portrait of a very particular kind of British Jewish life that isn’t represented very often. I thought the central performances were fantastic: subtle and human and nuanced and complex. It also contains one of the best cinematic sex scenes I’ve seen – erotic but also incredibly intimate, and emotional in that you come out the other end understanding more about those people than you do at the beginning, which should be the point of a scene like that. A really absorbing, thoughtful film.This is an extraordinary book. It’s not set in a specific time and place, but it’s generally assumed to be Belfast in the 1970s, and it’s about a young woman whose path crosses with a man she’s afraid of. There’s been a lot of mumbling about it being very difficult, and I don’t understand why that is. It’s not a book you can skim, but it has a real Northern Irish sense of humour threading through it, which I absolutely love – I found it unputdownable.This is in a railway arch in Forest Gate. It’s a tiny offshoot of their bakery in Leytonstone. They’ve just opened a little place beside it where you can come in and get a cup of coffee and a slice of cake to stave off the mid-afternoon slump. The interior is no frills – just some mismatched tables and a glass with spoons in it – but they do really nice coffee, quiche, and good chocolate brownies, I have to say.

But is there any political will to fix them?The WEF sees its role as “improving the state of the world”. But the political analyst and author Anand Giridharadas speaks for many critics when he calls Davos “a family reunion for the people who broke the world”.After decades championing globalisation, the WEF now fears that rising inequality, protectionism and nationalist politics could send the world economy “sleepwalking” into another crisis.As the WEF’s founder, Klaus Schwab, puts it: “Globalisation produces winners and losers and there are many more winners in the last 24, 25, 30 years – but now we have to look after the losers, after those who have been left behind.”Schwab will be pushing politicians and business chiefs towards a new “inclusive” globalisation to fix the gap between the “precariat” many and the privileged few. But will this address the concerns of the many millions who feel the current system is rigged against them, and who will never make the trek to Davos?Realistically, the WEF will be wrestling with the same problems in 2020 … and 2021 … and beyond.After years of warnings, most business leaders, politicians and economists seem to have got the message. Climate change and extreme weather events have rocketed to the top of the list of dangers facing the world economy, according to the WEF’s annual survey of global risks.Unfortunately, worsening international relations and rising nationalism means it’s even harder to get global agreement to address the problem, even though California’s wildfires and Europe’s recent floods have shown the human and economic cost of inaction.Fortunately, the WEF can turn to Sir David Attenborough to drive the message home. The broadcaster and naturalist (at 92, the oldest delegate risking Davos’s treacherously icy pavements) will address delegates – and warn them: “Never has an understanding of the natural world been so important to ensure a safe future for our planet.”Prince William will be challenging business leaders to improve emotional and mental wellbeing in their own workplaces. He is appearing on a “mental health matters” panel alongside the New Zealand PM, Jacinda Ardern.Kensington Palace says the Duke of Cambridge will “use the opportunity to highlight his belief that the world’s major employers have a vital role to play in promoting mentally healthy societies and workplaces”.Hopes that Davos might deliver a breakthrough in the US-China trade war were dashed when Donald Trump benched the entire White House delegation last Friday.In their absence, Wang Qishan, the vice-president of China, will give a special address. Behind the scenes, Wang will be pressed about how much damage the US trade war is causing, and whether China’s economy is slowing as quickly as some economists fear.It’s just a shame that the Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, the secretary of commerce, Wilbur Ross, and the US trade representative, Robert Lighthizer will not be there too.The new wave of populist leaders will be rubbing padded snow jackets with more mainstream politicians this year.Jair Bolsonaro, Brazil’s new rightwing president, will fill Trump’s snowboots by giving a special address on Tuesday, letting him set the agenda on the first day of the forum. Bolsonaro says he will be presenting “a different Brazil, free of ideological ties and widespread corruption”. His tax cuts and privatisations are popular with investors, so Davos will probably give the retired military officer a rousing reception.Human rights groups, though, would like to challenge Bolsonaro on his autocratic policies and recent loosening of gun laws.George Soros, scourge of populists, will also be in Davos, and probably taking a few potshots at the absent Trump. The French president Emmanuel Macon won’t catch them in person, though – he’s remaining in Paris to hold a national debate in response to the gilets jaunes (yellow vests) crisis.Theresa May is another Davos no-show this year, choosing to stay with the Brexit crisis in Westminster.The chancellor, Philip Hammond, is expected to attend and will get his ear bent by increasingly anxious UK business leaders worried about a no-deal Brexit.The WEF is planning to hold a session on Brexit wisely, it has held it back until the end of the week. As of Friday, no speakers had been named either. The PM might not mind missing out, given her distaste for the “citizens of the world” who flock to Davos each year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/79c8b6cdaefa7d959f9fcbf6397bdabee20c443f/0_418_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e94c5ff3f6c4d0fc21a87cbc7dda1b15","title":"dont need to be computer scientist to work out why iphone sales are down apple share price","story":"The slowdown at Apple should surprise no one given that most adults on the planet already have a smartphoneIt must be tough being Tim Cook, the CEO of Apple. Well, perhaps we shouldn’t be too sympathetic: in 2018 he took home $15,682,219, and his earnings since 2011 are estimated to be not far south of three quarters of a billion dollars. For that he has to run the world’s most successful tech company. But that’s probably a doddle compared with trying to manage the expectations of Wall Street and the world’s media, both of which have an obsession with Apple that sometimes borders on psychosis.Given that most of Apple’s revenues come from its iPhone, this sent the tech commentariat into overdrive – to the point where one level-headed observer had to point out that the sky hadn’t fallen: all that had happened was that Apple shares were down a bit. And all this despite the fact that the other bits of the company’s businesses (especially the watch, AirPods, services and its retail arm) were continuing to do nicely. Calmer analyses showed that the expected fall in revenues could be accounted for by two factors: the slowdown in the Chinese economy (together with some significant innovations by the Chinese internet giant WeChat) and the fact that consumers seem to be hanging on to their iPhones for longer, thereby slowing the steep upgrade path that had propelled Apple to its trillion-dollar valuation.What was most striking, though, was that the slowdown in iPhone sales should have taken journalists and analysts by surprise. Everyday experience should have told them that the iPhone picture was changing. I’ve lost count of the number of friends, colleagues and acquaintances who are happily still using their four- or five-year-old iPhones. The devices still work perfectly for their purposes. Sure, the camera isn’t as good as the one on the iPhone XS, but it’s still good enough for everyday use. My trusty old iPhone 6 is still more than adequate for my needs. In fact, since the last couple of iOS updates and a replacement battery, it’s as good as it ever was. And one of the things that would stop me upgrading is that I find its fingerprint recognition much more convenient for secure online activities than the much-touted face recognition in the newer iPhones would be. I’ve been an early adopter and a gadget freak for as long as I can remember, so if I’m not upgrading, there must be lots more like me.Besides, way back in August Bloomberg’s Tim Culpan had published a very perceptive piece under the headline “Dark clouds gather as tech stockpiles hit pre-crisis levels”, which made it crystal clear that there was a slowdown coming. Mr Culpan, who takes an interest in unfashionable topics like supply chains, had spotted that inventories were uncharacteristically high in the companies that supply parts to smartphone manufacturers. So it followed as the night the day that those same manufacturers were expecting to sell fewer phones.The significance of this, as pointed out by Benedict Evans – an acute observer of these things who produces an unmissable weekly newsletter – is that we’re approaching “peak smartphone”. There are 5.5 billion adults on Earth, of whom 5 billion have a mobile phone and between 3.5 billion and 4 billion have a smartphone, of which between 800 and 900m are iPhones. “The mobile market is reaching saturation,” writes Evans, “and so is the smartphone market, and Apple has won the high end of the smartphone market. This is not ‘the fall of Apple’ – it’s just the shift of smartphones to boring maturity, as we look for what’s next.”Which of course is what those wretches who made the trek to the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas recently were trying to find out. What’s going to be the New New Thing? And the heartening thing – at least for this columnist – is that nobody has a clue. Plus ça change. He’s right there…The Perils of Perception: Why We’re Wrong About Nearly Everything – an intriguing (and sometimes embarrassing) book by Bobby Duffy.Alexa’s army We were shocked to discover that Apple had 800 engineers working on the iPhone camera. The Wall Street Journal has reported that Amazon has over 10,000 employees working on Alexa. Can this be true?Happy snaps? Does taking photographs undermine the enjoyment of experiences? A new academic study published in the journal Psychology and Marketing says yes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/905f7933f26ade59792672e0f2aaf7d5a6fb4d79/278_142_4552_2732/master/4552.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4dc26dcb36b6d2664a0a82f27c38a4c5","title":"pity little darlings if they are being raised by parents who like to share","story":"As one of Instagram’s most highly regarded influencers, with 24 million followers, Victoria Beckham will of course have thought hard before posting a photograph of her seven-year-old daughter, Harper, eyes closed, enjoying a professional facial. It was captioned by Beckham – almost as if she knew something terrifying about soap that she is not, alas, at liberty to disclose – “We MUST use CLEAN products on our children!!”What kind of message would this send out, Beckham must have considered, particularly to parents cruelly reminded that they are at least a decade too late to extract any value from their own flesh and blood? Try getting anyone interested in a 21-year-old’s pores.True, as growing numbers of mummy bloggers have demonstrated, there can be decent mileage in a confident pubescent – or even in an unusually tattooed but otherwise unexceptional 19-year-old. But youthful compliance with extreme parental exhibitionism, as much as it may look easy, probably depends, like deference to religious fanaticism, on undeviating inculcation, best started before the child knows anything else. In utero, if not in Clearblue.Of course, as with escapees from Saudi Arabia, there will be exceptions, heartbreaking for the parents, where a carefully raised child refuses to perform. Some cases of suspected apostasy – a now rarely exhibited son, a recently invisible celebrity teen – serve as a warning to celebrity families and aspiring mummy bloggers of what can happen if the observances due to a brand are even fleetingly relaxed or interrupted. Just a few days of missed Instagrams or incomplete group hugs could swiftly lead to childish withdrawal, to ergent concepts of internet safety, a fatally damaged brand.Ideally, no more than a few days should separate the Instagramming of a seven-year-old’s facial from the reveal of her new ’do. Or, for less prominent parent influencers, tweeters and bloggers, photographs of a free family trip to Lapland from a vlog about a borrowed car: “I think,” confides our expert, “it’s an ideal car for a small family.”Where extended parental oversharing is concerned, it might also be wise to steer children away, for as long as possible, from the written evidence. At some point, the child will discover that their weight, or first period, or truculence, doubled as a fount of free copy. With luck, they may, like the grown children of the Tiger Mother, Amy Chua, pronounce themselves undamaged. Long before that, Jeffrey Archer reportedly relished his notoriety in Weston-super-Mare as the greedily calculating “Tuppence”, star of his mother’s weekly column, Over the Teacups. And as we know, it never did Jeffrey any harm.It will be a while, however, before we see the results of the unfolding, mass experiment on social media, whereby careless overdisclosure or parental commercial blogging makes continually updated data about young, non-consenting subjects available for general viewing and harvesting. Some academics have called this contribution to the wholesale datafication of children “intimate surveillance”.Readily monetised, with rewards often described by happy mummy bloggers, it plainly has attractions for parents, themselves the beneficiaries of unvlogged childhoods, which run counter to their children’s interests. A 2016 study suggested that children were twice as likely as their parents to believe that adults should not post about them without permission.Though Tate remains in negotiation with her daughter, it’s still possible to read, in her blog Swaddled with Joy, her extended tribute to her son’s dried snot, which does in fact pass for surpassing artistry within the genre.Rarely can the limits of the late Nora Ephron’s “everything is copy” have been so exhaustively demonstrated as in mummymommy blogs, where no detail is too banal for disclosure in entries whose purpose is – not unreasonably – to earn money. “It’s Christmas jumper day!” confides an admired UK exemplar. “I can’t handle how much love I have for these two little people.”Compared with contemporary mummy blogs, most of whose promotion-friendly casts, with names such as Big boy, Ickle wee and Daddy P, rarely seem to do much more than cuddle in matching pyjamas, Mrs Archer’s doting Over the Teacups read, when you revisit, like late Chekhov.But much depends on taste and writing style is largely immaterial to the conflict between the digital parent’s right to express her (rarely his) proud caregiver’s self and what is due to the child under the UN Convention on Rights of the Child. Article 16, in the UN’s child-friendly version: “You have the right to privacy.” Article 3: “All adults should do what is best for you.” It’s probably reassuring to mommy bloggers that even before the arrival of intimate surveillance, the UN convention proved to be entirely compatible with real-life versions of Little Miss Sunshine.Maybe most Big boys and Ickle wees feel, if asked, that loss of privacy and an ineradicably extended digital footprint are a reasonable price – providing snot, spots and puberty are left out of it – to pay for frequent family holidays. Christie Tate’s daughter may be atypical. As it is, for all the growing scholarly anxiety around child datafication, there remains little, other than delayed resentment and unspecified algorithmic consequences, to deter parents from digitally capitalising, a la Beckham, on their own children.There is hope, even, for parents who have missed this opportunity. Just because you can’t be a Victoria Beckham doesn’t mean you can’t – though it takes the right child – become a Stanley Johnson."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3a4b9b33b253974583bb9d72385414e9257a8276/11_0_3590_2154/master/3590.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9f69a3fe3c0c171e7b18a8a683ca7719","title":"very idea that britain can develop its own independent trade policy is absurd","story":"So devastated is the British economy beyond Greater London that only two regions are strong enough to be net contributors to the exchequer – the south-east and the east of England. The rest of the country depends on the buoyancy of London’s service-based economy and accompanying tax revenues to support their schools, hospitals and social benefits.It is this same economic and trading weakness that explains our current account deficit, estimated to be £85bn in 2018, with a deficit in goods approaching £150bn. Without the surpluses Greater London earns in services, including finance, education, consultancy and law, much of Britain would be flat on its back. Of course there should have been an industrial policy to benefit the whole country and a reshaping of our capitalism decades ago, but Thatcherite Tories and New Labour failed us. We are where we are and the dangers are stark and little understood.For this is why the consequences of leaving the EU’s internal and external trade framework to trade on World Trade Organisation (WTO) terms are so serious. What’s more, as we learned last week, no trade deals are in place with any of the countries with whom the EU currently has trade agreements. The capacity of our key service industries to trade successfully with Europe and the rest of the world will be fatally undermined.Our current account deficit will balloon to impossibly high levels, potentially triggering an unstoppable run on sterling. If there were a crime for ministerial incompetence, the international trade secretary, Liam Fox, boasting only 16 months ago that after 29 March Britain would have all its necessary trade agreements in place, would be arrested. At the very least, he should resign in shame.Strategically, Britain has to do two things – sustain its vital strength in its competitive service industries and start building businesses in every town to bring back economic vitality and the potential for exports. Forget the Brexiter guff about having an “ independent trade policy” – so important we must leave the EU’s customs union, single market and trade agreements it has with 61 countries. “Independence” is besides the point and meaningless. The issue is effectiveness – retaining vital market access for our service exporters having the heft to make sure key non-tariff standards on intellectual property, safety and product design suit us and working closely with other medium-size countries to ensure openness in an increasingly protectionist world and menaced WTO. EU membership secures all these goals and, what’s more, is democratic.Today’s economy is a universe apart from the early 19th-century world on which Brexit economists base their outmoded economic models. Most production was then national, most goods homogeneous and bog-standard it was price principally that determined buying and selling decisions. Today’s advanced economies are highly interdependent with sophisticated supply chains that  many countries. Many goods and services are complex, differentiated and contain much more “intangible” value – in design, know-how, content – than tangible physical value. Thus the standards, regulations and protocols that frame intangible production, particularly of services, have become the key determinant of whether goods and services, from advertising to mobile phone networks, can be legitimately and competitively traded across national boundaries.Two overriding conclusions follow. What governs sales of British producers is less price and more whether what they produce meshes with the other parts of multinational companies’ supply chains, conforming to their regulatory and safety standards. Nor is there much scope to quickly re-resource production, if the pound devalues, which is pre-planned and preordained. For many knowledge-driven services, what drives the buying decision is more the rarity of the intellectual property and knowledge being offered.Brexiters expect devaluation of the pound automatically to stimulate exports, while tariffs are key determinants of exports and imports. Wrong. Falls in sterling are having ever less impact on British exports as the price matters less, one of the reasons leading Brexiter economist Patrick Minford came a spectacular 41st out of 41 economic forecasters for 2018. Exports have been flat. Nor is it tariffs that matter but the non-tariff barriers to trade worth four times as much, especially on intangibles, and which the single market harmonises.A company such as Vodafone, one our few recent success stories, acknowledges it could never have built its global pre-eminence without British standards transmuting into global standards via the EU. Indeed, in the 10 years up to the referendum Britain, via the EU, had become the global standard setter. Common non-tariff standards in the single market boost the services and companies in which Britain is strongest.The EU’s trading frameworks put WTO rules in the shade. From aviation to data, chemical production to nitrogen dioxide emissions, the EU sets global standards. There is no nirvana where these regulations can be escaped. The WTO is neither a standard setter, nor does its remit extend to services of such importance to us. After 29 March, Britain will be on its own, not only trying to replace the EU’s deals with countries dragging their feet, but attempting to open up the US, India and China to our service industries to compensate for what we have lost in Europe. Always protectionist, they have become even more so over the past few years. Only last week, China refused Visa and Mastercard access to its market.Little of this is ventilated in parliament. Backbench MPs, flexing their muscles with 10 weeks left to avoid a national disaster, need to flex them much more and to recognise trade realities. An “independent trade policy” discussed in such a vacuum of understanding is a slogan so empty and barren it is heartbreaking.

In this world of ours, that seeks to give away its secrets one by one, that feeds on false confidences and fabricated revelations, it is the very incarnation of mystery, and the best proof of the spell it casts is that, now more than ever, it is the topic on everyone’s lips.”However relevant these words seem in the era of instagram influencers and fake news, they were spoken by the French fashion designer Christian Dior in 1956, 10 years after he launched his eponymous atelier in Paris at the age of 41. Today, on the eve of a major retrospective of his work at London’s Victoria and Albert Museum, it’s not just the late designer’s words that feel prescient.His legacy as the founder of the world’s most illustrious fashion house means his handwriting is writ large across the world of contemporary style, more than 70 years after he unveiled his first collection to critical acclaim in February 1947.From the business suits worn by career women in the city to Hollywood’s red-carpet gowns, the influence of this humble couturier looms large, while almost every modern designer has been inspired by his creations at some point in their career.The “bar” suit – perhaps now one of the best-known styles of the 20th century with its full, knife-pleated skirt and strictly tailored hourglass jacket – was the lynchpin of Dior’s debut Corolle collection, shown at his fledgling salon on the Avenue Montaigne. “I wanted my dresses to be constructed, moulded on the curves of the female body whose contours they would stylise,” the designer said of his signature silhouette. “I accentuated the waist, the volume of the hips, I emphasised the bust.”Still reeling from the austerity of the war, and the sombre mood that prevailed across Europe, Dior’s refreshingly extravagant use of fabric and flamboyant silhouettes was greeted with delight by assembled guests. As the presentation ended, the euphoric editor-in-chief of Harpers Bazaar, Carmel Snow, swept up to the former art gallerist, declaring: “It’s quite a revolution, dear Christian! Your dresses have such a new look!”. A Reuters correspondent overheard the accolade and filed the “new look” line to his bureau for global distribution, effectively creating the postwar equivalent of a viral hashtag.And so it was that when the V\u0026ampA appointed its first specialist curator of dress, Madeleine Ginsburg, 10 years later, one of her first acquisitions for the museum’s new costume court was the bar suit, donated by Dior in 1960 after Ginsburg approached the house and forged a close relationship that exists to this day.“By far the most requested piece at our clothworkers’ study centre, which houses an archive of over 100,000 fashion items and is open to designers, academics and members of the public by appointment, is the bar suit. That is testament to the power of Dior.”This celebrated ensemble forms part of the forthcoming exhibition, Christian Dior: Designer of Dreams, which is based on a highly successful 2017 Musée des Arts Décoratifs spectacle in Paris, Christian Dior: Couturier du Rêve, commemorating the 70th anniversary of the label’s debut. Staged to great acclaim, the show traced the history and impact of Dior, and the six artistic directors who succeeded him: Yves St Laurent, Marc Bohan, Gianfranco Ferré, John Galliano, Raf Simons and, since 2016, the first female creative director, Maria Grazia Chiuri, whose feminist yet feminine style has received plaudits around the world – remember those “We should all be feminists” T-shirts in her debut collection?While retaining the hallmarks of the original Paris show, the V\u0026ampA features about 230 haute couture garments, including 100 or so unique garments that were not shown in Paris, plus a brand new section that explores the designer’s fascination with British culture. It will showcase a number of pieces owned by high-profile Britons, such as author and socialite Nancy Mitford, ballet dancer Margot Fonteyn, and Princess Margaret, who visited the Dior salon and ordered from him on her first trip to Paris, at the age of 18, and wore one of his most elaborate gowns for a Cecil Beaton portrait to mark her 21st birthday. In fact, the designer staged a secret fashion show for the Queen (later the Queen Mother) and Princess Margaret at the French embassy in 1950, named Operation Révérence.Such was his passion for London society that he set up in the capital’s Conduit Street in 1952, and hosted a number of charity fashion shows in the country, the first at the Savoy hotel in London and many others at country estates such as Blenheim Palace. He established links with department stores in a number of cities and sold British-made Christian Dior collections that were highly coveted by women across the nation. His first such collection, in 1953, was presented at a week of daily shows in Harrods, attracting more than 10,000 visitors to the store’s fashion theatre.While in the UK, Dior would visit specialist British manufacturers, such as Dents (gloves), H \u0026amp M Rayne (shoes), Lyle \u0026amp Scott (knitwear) and Mitchel Maer (costume jewellery), admiring their craftsmanship and developing collaborative collections. Shortly before his death in 1957, Dior partnered with Market Harborough-based corset makers R \u0026amp WH Symington to produce Dior-designed underwear “made specially to English fittings”.“Dior was extremely enamoured with the British aristocracy and the royal family, with their wardrobes packed with tweeds and ballgowns,” says Kate Strasdin, senior lecturer in fashion history and cultural studies at Falmouth University. “But he also loved the very real sensibilities of everyday style here, and had a passion for Savile Row suits. He felt that all of the skills we had here brought a lot to the couture table and placed enormous value on that. Even today, the house of Dior shares videos on social media sharing the workmanship of their embroiderers, feather-workers and other artisan skills that have been kept alive thanks to the world of haute couture.”Christian Dior: Designer of Dreams, the Sainsbury Gallery, V\u0026ampA, London, 2 February – 14 July"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/050834a9aa8e6cb66e92099687db3aafa64c5e13/106_0_3109_1865/master/3109.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=872c6eab344d8c60cc7427cafd1a8981","title":"january blues is just a matter of getting the right eyeshadow","story":"Choose the colour to match your moodBeauty?

With luck it will be buried treasure: the remains of a casserole steamed potatoes and greens ready for bubble and squeak a squirrelled-away apple crumble. It is a sad day when the contents turn out to be some of yesterday’s pasta.With luck, my dear old bowl will be full of soup whose character will have mellowed for having spent a night in the fridge. Such recipes are the backbone of my eating in January and February. The best of them begin with an onion, a rib of celery and a few bay leaves and will be started on a low heat, so the onions soften without much colour. I try to catch the onions just as they turn from white to gold, when you can crush them, effortlessly, against the side of the pot with the back of a spoon. You can add cooked haricots at this point, or chickpeas or butter beans borlotti and black-eyed beans, too, the sort whose water turns dark pink-brown as they simmer. Before you know it, you have dinner.So far so sustaining, but I want my fresh, vital winter greens, too. I like to finish any soup with something leafy. Frills of kale, tiny frost-crisped sprouts or shredded winter cabbage tossed in at the end will all do. The greens will lighten a long-cooked soup like a bright torch shining down a dark well. It is worth remembering those winter greens will also make a splendid cream soup. Shred the leaves then stir into softened onions and simmer with milk and crumbled cheese for a cold weather soup that manages to be both refined and rough edged at the same time.A main-course soup, made reasurringly thick by blending a good third of it and returning it to the rest of the ingredients.To finish:kale or brussels sprout tops 150gparsley leaves a good handfulolive oil to finishSoak the beans overnight in a bowl of cold water. The next day, drain the beans, put them in a deep saucepan, cover with water and bring to the boil. Lower the heat, skim off any froth then add the bay leaves and leave at a gently rolling boil for an hour or until the beans are almost tender. Check the water level regularly. Remove from the heat, but leave the beans in the water.Peel and roughly chop the onion and the carrot. Pull the needles from the rosemary sprigs and chop finely. Remove the leaves from the celery and reserve, then chop the celery into small pieces. Peel and finely chop the garlic.Warm the olive oil in a heavy based saucepan. When it’s hot, add the onion, carrot, rosemary, celery and garlic and cook over a low heat for 15 minutes, until the vegetables are starting to soften.Scrub the potato and cut into small dice. Roughly chop the tomato and stir it, together with the potato, into the softening vegetables and herbs. Cover the pan with a lid and continue cooking, stirring regularly, for 15-20 minutes until the potato has softened. Add the beans and 1 litre of their cooking liquid. Season generously with salt and pepper and continue cooking for 30 minutes until everything is thick, rich and fragrant. Ladle one third of the mixture into a blender, process till smooth then stir back into the soup.Pick over the kale or sprout tops, discarding anything that isn’t sparklingly fresh. Tear into pieces then dunk under the surface of the soup and leave to soften for 2 or 3 minutes.Roughly chop the parsley and celery leaves. Ladle the soup into bowls, scatter with the chopped celery and parsley leaves and finish with a trickle of olive oil.The subtle eau de Nil colour darkens if you try to keep the soup for tomorrow.

Peel and roughly chop the onions.Melt the butter in a deep pan and add the chopped onion. Fry gently over a moderate heat for about 10 minutes until the onion is glossy and sweet smelling. Separate the leaves of the sprout tops, pick off the whole sprouts, set aside and finely chop the stems. Add the stems and combine with the onion. Finely shred the sprout tops, stir into the onion and cook for 4 to 5 minutes, stirring almost constantly until the leaves are bright green and wilted. Add the infused milk and cheese mixture and bring almost to the boil. Ladle into a blender and process to a thick but not totally smooth soup. Check the seasoning – you are likely to need black pepper but not salt.To finish, cut the reserved sprouts in half and fry lightly in the butter.

Chelsea’s first shot on target did not come until the 82nd minute, from Marcos Alonso.“But it appears we still seem to lack sufficient motivation, being mentally solid and determination. So I’m not happy, I’m really not happy. I’d prefer to be in the changing room, speaking to the players, to talk about why we lost from a tactical point of view. But the fact of the matter is it appears this group of players are extremely difficult to motivate. When you see this kind of game, when one team is quite obviously more determined than the other, you can’t really talk about tactics. From a technical point of view both teams are pretty much on the same level, but Arsenal were more determined. Tactics don’t come into it.“Their high level of determination was obvious throughout, particularly in both penalty areas. If you think about their determination and how clinical they were when they scored the goals, in defence we stood off a lot and we were not determined and not strong enough.“Don’t get me wrong, we could have lost that game anyway, but we could have lost it for tactical reasons. We lost it because of our determination. I couldn’t possibly say I am not responsible as well, in part at least, for the mental approach. That’s something we have to share.”Sarri, who hopes to add the Juventus striker Gonzalo Higuaín to his options before the second leg of the Carabao Cup semi-final against Spurs on Thursday, has been critical of his players’ attitude at times this season, suggesting they can be guilty of complacency when ahead in matches. But the Italian remains uncertain how to instil more motivation into the group. “It seems to me that, as a group of players, they’re not particularly aggressive from a mental point of view,” he said. “They don’t have that ferocity in their mentality. That’s down to the type of players they are, their characteristics.“It’s something that is difficult to change. You have to try and influence their mentality and it could take quite a long time, or, by the same token, it could be changed with a new player coming in or one of the old heads in the team assuming more responsibility and driving the rest of the team forward.”Asked if he remains the right man to oversee Chelsea’s progression, he added: “Yes, absolutely. I’m very aware this is never going to be a team well known for its battling and fighting qualities. From a technical point of view, those aren’t the characteristics that we have. But what we need to become is a team capable of adapting, a team that can perhaps suffer for 10-15 minutes during the game but then play our own football.“Today we didn’t play our own football. Our defending ended up with us running backwards rather than pressing high up the pitch. We are a team that should be playing one or two touches. Instead at some stages we were playing with seven or eight. This is the sort of thing I don’t want to happen. We are going to have to try and change that.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8cccbae033fe05183f5ca6d26e130ccfff6582b3/0_662_4388_2633/master/4388.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d6323f7afe264b287a78b727e811aa5a","title":"ellen page im not afraid to say the truth interview coming out","story":"Taking aim at everyone from Trump to Tinseltown, Ellen Page has become one of Hollywood’s most outspoken gay actors. She tells Eva Wiseman how she found her voiceEllen Page was standing in a car park in Brazil as a masked man explained why he murders gay people. It was 2015, and she was filming Gaycation, the documentary series she made with her best friend Ian Daniel after coming out on Valentine’s Day a year earlier. “I’m here today because I am gay and because maybe I can make a difference,” she’d said in a speech at a Human Rights Campaign conference that has since been shared many millions of times. “I suffered for years because I was scared to be out… And I’m standing here today, with all of you, on the other side of all that pain.”In the car park, the only sign that she’s disturbed by this ex-cop and his promise to kill again is a familiar crinkling between her eyebrows. This is a technique she deployed effectively when explaining why she was going to keep the baby in Juno (for which she received an Academy Award nomination), and talking an abuser through his castration in her breakout role in Hard Candy, and then in Inception, as the world exploded around her. Page shields her mouth from the murderer as she asks her producer whether she’ll be safe if she tells him she’s gay. “I want to,” she says, firmly. So she does.I arrive at our New York restaurant as evening settles, but the place is empty. “Are you here to meet, uh, Alan?” the waitress beams, walking me to a seemingly unoccupied booth. And there she is, slouched on a banquette, 5ft 1in under four layers of shirt, looking at her phone beneath a wide-brimmed cap. Not an inch of flesh is showing between her knuckles and chin – none of her eight homemade tattoos (including nicknames of her friends Catherine Keener and Kristen Wiig) are visible, and the light is such that her face remains in shadow.She orders me a tequila cocktail and explains why she chose this restaurant – it’s on the doorstep of her new home – in an apologetic tone. She never thought she’d live somewhere like this fancy apartment block, “but they have a composting system so…” Now 31, she has just moved to the city, in part because she loves to walk, and LA resents walkers, and in part for her wife’s work – Emma Portner, 24 and a dancer, was the youngest woman to choreograph a West End musical. Page first saw her dancing on Instagram they married soon after.When our allotted hour is up, Portner will lope into the empty restaurant in an oversized black hoodie, her face barely visible, and slide into the homely crook of Page’s arm – “Hi sweetie” – and Page will relax for the first time. Portner will fold herself on to the seat shyly, rest her head on the table and wait for me to leave, so I will.Growing up in Nova Scotia, Page got her first acting job at 10, but found uncomfortable fame in 2007 with Juno, an indie film that eventually catapulted her into roles in huge blockbusters such as X-Men and Inception. It had such an impact that when, a year later, 17 students became pregnant at a school in Massachusetts at the same time as Sarah Palin’s 17-year-old daughter, Time magazine called it “the Juno Effect”. At which point, Page decided to disappear. For a while at least.There’s a phrase that makes distinct the difference between going for a drink after work and a plan to throw yourself into a night of parties whatever the absolute hell might happen, and it’s this that I think of when looking at the decisions Page made after an entire career avoiding questions about her sexuality. In 2014 she didn’t just come out, she came “out-out” as if making up for lost time. She appeared at Ted Cruz’s barbecue with a microphone and challenged him through a cloud of pork smoke on Twitter she mourned the death of nine-year-old Jamel Myles who took his own life as a result of homophobic bullying her Gaycation series, travelling around the world meeting the most marginalised LGBTQ communities, was more than just a travel show. Like all her interventions since that Valentine’s Day speech, it was a statement of intent. The day before we meet, she posts a tearful photo on her Instagram, marking her first anniversary of marriage to Portner. “Beyond grateful to all those who fought to allow us to be wife \u0026amp wife.” Her outness is not incidental: it’s pointed and political, and it reads as something between liberation and apology, the apology being for not coming out sooner.She has just wrapped on Netflix’s new series of Tales of the City, the most recent adaptation of Armistead Maupin’s groundbreaking novels that chart the lives of a group of friends in San Francisco. Maupin first found a mainstream sort of fame upon posthumously outing his friend Rock Hudson, and more than 30 years later he maintains the moral obligation he feels to lift the stigma of homo sexuality by being truthful.I wonder if Page, out-out as she is today, feels a similar pull? “I have a responsibility to be out now, because I have these resources. I can access therapists and security and support. But the reality is a lot of people can be in severely grave danger. I think, for instance, it would have been very harmful for me if someone had outed me earlier. When I was 20, someone wrote an article with the headline: ‘The Ellen Page Sexuality Sweepstakes’ in the Village Voice. ‘Is Juno a you know?’” it concluded. She shudders, remembering the effect it had on her to have her sexuality debated in the press before she had come to terms with it herself. “I never even touched a woman outside until I was 27. I was very depressed, and very anxious. I was not well.”After Juno’s success and the inevitable graduation to red-carpet star (with recurring appearances on FHM’s Sexiest 100 list), she needed to escape. She enrolled on a permaculture course in an eco-village in Oregon where, building giant composts and peeing in buckets, she met Ian Daniel, seemingly the only person in America that year to have no idea who she was. “I know Hollywood can be an overwhelming and toxic system at times,” he emails from India, explaining the “grace” of his friend. “She pushed back to be herself in a place that wanted her to be a more conventional feminine ideal. She wasn’t interested in that. I think she sees that the world needs to see more mainstream representations of the multitude of ways we really are. She risked a lot by coming out when she did, but she had the insight to know she could help make it easier for others in the future – and that she would be happier, too. She’s helped create a new path for LGBTQ people in Hollywood. For someone so small,” he adds, “she has huge force.”Together they embarked on Gaycation, leading with their own queerness. Page’s public coming out began with the speech, but continued through this exploration of communities. Continues, even. “Filming, I felt sadness and anger, but mixed with the most powerful inspiring moments of absolute joy, and gratitude, to be in the presence not only of activists but iniduals who are brave because they are themselves every day.”Interviewing anti-gay men like Brazil’s president Jair Bolsonaro and a Rastafarian leader in Jamaica, did they feel like they changed any minds? She purses her lips. “There were a couple of moments where you’d see a little spark. But I’m sad to say that that was rare. I want to be like: ‘Yeah, Ted Cruz came over afterwards and we had a longer convo and he gets it now!’ But no, I mean, when you’re talking to the head of a neo-Nazi group in the Ukraine, you’re probably not going to end up hugging. But, you’re at least going to have a conversation and some kind of representation.” She takes a deep breath, resigned. This is her job now.Page has been working since she was 10 and, in a certain light, she could still pass for a kid. In the show she’s promoting today, The Umbrella Academy, she plays the only non-powerful sibling in a dysfunctional family with superpowers and, even when in dialogue with a monkey butler (long story), she moves with the haunted delicacy of a child that’s seen too much.How does her appearance affect the way she’s treated? “People are condescending. Though, it’s hard to know if it’s because I look young or because I’m a woman? It’s definitely affected how I’ve learned to express my opinion, though. I’ve become more direct in a way that’s really positive. It’s a lot to do with coming out, and the time spent figuring that out. I’m more… in my body?”In 2017 she published a long post on Facebook about her experiences of harassment at work, including a story about one of Hollywood’s most successful directors Brett Ratner. It began: “‘You should fuck her to make her realise she’s gay.’ He said this about me during a cast and crew meet and greet before we began filming X-Men: The Last Stand. I was 18.” Writing this, she found her voice: “Ratner’s comment replayed in my mind many times over the years as I encountered homophobia and coped with feelings of reluctance and uncertainty about the industry and my future in it.“Something had switched,” she remembers. “I wanted to talk about the shittiness I’d seen. I’ve dealt with these difficult things, whether it’s directors trying to sleep with me when I was 16, or stalkers. But there are people in society who deal with far, far worse and cannot access the resources I have.”She does this often – catches herself in a moment of pity, and then quickly reminds herself of her immense privilege, something she wears heavily, like another shirt, a sort of feel-bad feminism that means even when she is describing something objectively terrible that happened to her, she must contextualise it within a continent of greater suffering. It seems exhausting. But perhaps necessary, for a person so aware of the internet’s reactions to an offhand quote and, perhaps, necessary for a person so aware of the platform she has.“What changed for me after publishing that was the realisation how much crazy shit happened that was so normalised. And I internalised it. It’s disturbing. Then, talking about it does really open something in you, which is painful in many ways. But that’s what’s letting us all connect and have the conversations, about intersectional feminism, etc.”Page is constantly working to educate herself, from reading Rebecca Solnit’s The Mother of All Questions (“Which is super”) to learning geography from an app. “I’m always learning, I’m always humble, but trying to be open and grow, and also to remind myself of the times when I didn’t know all this. In order to remember not to jump on people for getting stuff wrong, you know?”So if she doesn’t see change happening in the industry, why does she stay? “How can I hold two things in my head at the same time? Well, we’re all doing it, aren’t we? We’re at a place where we’ve been told the world as we know it will be gone by 2030, and we’re still all just checking our email. I love working with brilliant actors, so I’m making movies. But it’s a… strange time.”One thing we need to do, she says, is change the language. “We need to stop claiming the political activists are ‘radical’. The people who are fucking radical are the people who want to keep destroying our water and our top soil and our air in order to give a few people billions more dollars.” They’re the extremists, she insists, not the people who want Americans to have universal health care. “It’s not a debate, whether Donald Trump is racist or not. Gay marriage is not a debate. And the media needs to stop claiming it is.”What does she do about this, day to day? “We just have to try and educate ourselves. And really speak up. I’m learning to worry less about what people think, and not to be afraid to say the truth. Which is: ‘What’s happening right now is wrong.’” Those “feelings of reluctance” that she wrote about on Facebook, about her future in the industry, seem to have been resolved, not by quitting, but by refocusing her lens.Here is the biggest public change since Page came out – the product of her acting is not the film, but instead the activism. The film is just the thing she does to make strangers listen. “Yes, but, I mean, I almost feel bad agreeing, because I think of the activists I’ve met who spend decades of their lives sacrificing so much in order to create substantial change. They’re the ones who should be listened to.” In her Facebook post about sexual abuse in Hollywood she listed people who had led the fight, including Marsha P Johnson and Audre Lorde. “If I can amplify their voices,” she says, “then that’s my aim.”In Brazil, which has one of the highest murder rates of gay and transgender people in the world, Page coming out to the serial killer after enquiring after her safety caused him to pause, uncomfortable beneath his mask, before he walked out. She ended the episode explaining that, despite standing before a man who would prefer her dead, she left Brazil feeling inspired by a country where people live in such joyous celebration of who they are, especially in the face of such violence. “The spirit of love is what wins out in the end.”She tells me she’s enjoying exploring New York, having spent the day walking with her wife, discussing the Mae Martin comedy special they’d watched the night before, how amazing it would have been to see something like that as a teenager, something so honest and funny about sexuality. “Oh yeah, we did well over 10,000 steps before lunch,” she says, unboasting. Then, suddenly, Portner is there and Page is grinning with a slow sort of relief, and they hold hands over the table, and she’s safe.The Umbrella Academy launches on Netflix on 15 February"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e33c89e0a54a3a73a80e11d89a22e2c56d487cff/0_460_3150_1890/master/3150.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=390213bdf44c5a1d8bbf63118acb547d","title":"going underground exploring the mysterious world beneath our feet book","story":"Down below street level is a mysterious world honeycombed with tunnels and caves. But why does the dark still fill us with foreboding?You can find signs of it everywhere you go. Step out of your front door and feel beneath your feet the thrum of tube tunnels and electric cables, mossy aqueducts and pneumatic pipes, all interweaving and overlapping like threads on a great loom. If the surface of the Earth were transparent, we’d spend days on our bellies, peering down into this marvellous layered terrain. But for us surface dwellers, going about our lives in the sunlit world, the underground has always been invisible.In its obscurity, it is our planet’s most abstract landscape, always more metaphor than space. When we describe something as “underground” – an illicit economy, a secret rave, an undiscovered artist – we are typically describing not a place but a feeling: something forbidden, unspoken, or otherwise beyond the known and ordinary.The underground is our ghost landscape, unfolding everywhere beneath our feet, always out of view. But as a boy, I knew that the underworld was not always invisible – to certain people, it could be revealed. The summer I turned 16, when my world felt as small and known as the tip of my finger, I discovered an abandoned train tunnel running beneath my neighbourhood in Providence, Rhode Island. I’d heard about it first from a science teacher at school. The tunnel had once served a small cargo line, he’d told me, but that was years ago. Now it was a ruin – full of mud and garbage and stale air and who knew what else.One afternoon, I found the entrance, which was concealed under a thicket of bushes behind a dentist’s office. It was wreathed in vines and had the date of its construction, 1908, engraved in the concrete above its mouth. Along with a few friends, I climbed underground, our flashlight beams crisscrossing in the dark. The mud sucked at our shoes and the air was boggy.On the ceiling were clusters of pearly, nipple-like stalactites that dripped water down onto our heads. Halfway through, we dared one another to switch off our lights. As the tunnel fell into perfect darkness, my friends whooped, testing the echo, but I held my breath and stood completely still, as though, if I moved, I might float right off the ground.That night at home, I pulled up an old map of Providence. I started with my finger where we’d entered the tunnel and moved it to where it opened at the other end. I blinked – the tunnel passed almost directly beneath my house.That summer, on days when no one else was around, I’d put on boots and go walking in the tunnel. I couldn’t have explained what drew me down, and I certainly never went with any particular mission. I’d look at the graffiti or kick around empty bottles. Sometimes I’d turn off my light, just to see how long I could last in the dark before my nerves started to bristle.To the extent that I was aware of myself at all, as a 16-year-old I sensed that these walks were outside of my character. I was an uncertain teenager, scrawny, gap-toothed, with librarianish glasses. When my friends were starting to make out with girls, I still had a terrarium of pet tree frogs in my bedroom. I read about other people’s adventures in books, without ever thinking to embark on my own. But something about the tunnel got under my skin: I’d lie in bed on some nights just imagining it running under the street.Years passed and I forgot about those underground walks. I left Providence, went to college, moved on. But my old connection to the tunnel never quite disappeared and much later, following a series of unexpected encounters with the underground of New York City, my old memories re-emerged. It began the first summer I lived in New York, when I was working at a magazine in Manhattan and living in Brooklyn with my aunt, uncle and two cousins. After years spent as a teenager, envisioning myself as a New Yorker, I had arrived to find the city impenetrable. I shrank in crowds and got off at the wrong subway stop, only to wander through Brooklyn too embarrassed to ask for directions.Late one night, I was waiting for the subway in Lower Manhattan, on one of the deep-set platforms where on summer nights you can almost smell the city’s granite bedrock, when I saw something that baffled me. From the darkness of the tunnel materialised two young men: they wore headlamps and their faces and hands were black with soot, as though they’d been climbing for days through a deep cave. They walked quickly up the tracks, clambered onto the platform right in front of me and vanished up the stairs. I rode the train home that night with my forehead pressed against the window, fogging the glass, imagining a whole secret honeycomb of spaces hidden beneath the streets.The young men in headlamps were urban explorers, part of a loose confederacy of New Yorkers who’d made a hobby of infiltrating the off-limits and secret spaces under the surface of the city. Some were historians who documented the grandeur of the city’s forgotten places others were activists who trespassed to symbolically reclaim New York’s corporatised areas, or artists who assembled secret installations and staged performances in the city’s obscure layers.In those first weeks, as I puzzled my way through New York, I found myself staying up late studying explorers’ photographs of hidden places: subway stations abandoned for decades deep-valve chambers in the water system derelict bomb shelters coated in dust – all of which felt as mysterious as lost sea monsters under the ocean.One night, while sifting through an explorer’s archives, I was startled to find myself looking at a photograph of the tunnel I’d explored as a boy in Providence. I hadn’t thought about it in years: the single rail receding into the dark, the 1908 carved above the entrance. The photographer, I learned, was a man named Steve Duncan – a dashing, brilliant and possibly deranged inidual who would become my first guide into the underground.We met one afternoon on a trip to the Bronx, where Steve was plotting an excursion through an old sewer pipe. He’d begun exploring during his freshman year at Columbia University, where he would go slinking through a network of steam tunnels under the campus. Over the years, he styled himself as a guerrilla historian and photographer, with an alarmingly granular knowledge of the city’s infrastructure. That day, we zigzagged between sewer grates, shining flashlights underground, tracing the route of the pipe. My first solo descent was a gentle one: a walk through the West Side Tunnel – known to explorers and graffiti writers as the Freedom Tunnel – which runs for some two and a half miles beneath Riverside Park on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. On a summer’s morning, I slipped through a gap in a chain-link fence near 125th Street and headed through the tunnel’s entrance, which was voluminous, maybe 20ft high and twice that across. Every few hundred feet there was a rectangular ventilation grate in the ceiling, which, like a cathedral window, let in soft columns of light. I set off on a quiet walk through the middle of Manhattan without seeing another soul, like something from a dream.The times I was above ground, I would trace and retrace the same path between work and home, following a narrow track of sensory experience. Down in the tunnel, however, I stepped outside those bounds, and connected to the city in a new and visceral way. I felt shaken awake, as if I was making contact with New York for the first time.Going underground, crawling down into the body of the city, became my way of proving to myself that I belonged in New York, that I knew the city. I liked being able to tell my born-and-raised Manhattanite friends about old vaults beneath their neighbourhood that they knew nothing about. Down in sunken alleys, I enjoyed seeing textures of the city that were invisible to people on the surface: ancient graffiti tags, cracks in the foundations of skyscrapers, exotic moulds creeping over walls, decades-old newspapers crumpled in hidden crevices. New York and I shared secrets. I was sifting through hidden drawers, reading private letters.Near the Brooklyn Navy Yard one night, Steve laid orange construction cones around a manhole and popped open the lid with an iron hook, releasing a twist of vapour from below. We climbed down the ladder, hand over hand on slimy rungs, and splashed down into a sewer collector. It was about 12ft high with greenish water burbling down the centre. The air was warm – my glasses immediately fogged. I hesitated before ducking under long, gooey strings of bacteria dangling from the ceiling – affectionately known as “snotsicles”. But the sewer was less repellent than I’d expected. The smell was not so much faecal as earthy, like an old farm shed full of fertiliser. We moved our lights over banks of loamy muck, like sandbars in a river, where tiny crops of albino mushrooms grew. With each trip underground, the city cracked open a little more, disclosing another secret, just enough to draw me deeper. Each trip I climbed further down, taking risks that surprised even myself.In the darkest strata I encountered the mole people, the homeless men and women who live in the city’s hidden nooks and vaults. One night, along with Steve and a few other urban explorers, I met a woman named Brooklyn, who’d been living underground for 30 years. She had a pocked face with dreadlocks piled high on her head. Her home, which she called her “igloo”, was an alcove hidden in the eaves of a tunnel. It was furnished with a mattress and a few crooked pieces of furniture she’d found. That particular day was Brooklyn’s birthday. We passed around a bottle of whiskey, as she sang a medley of Tina Turner and Michael Jackson songs, and for a while everyone laughed. But then something came undone, Brooklyn’s singing ceased and she became incoherent. She started seeing things that weren’t there. Her partner returned and the two of them fought, shrieking in the dark. We have lived in caves and underground hollows for as long as humans have existed. And for just as long, these spaces have evoked in us visceral and perplexing emotions. The “dark zone” of a cave – the name scientists use for the parts of a cave beyond the “twilight zone”, which is within the reach of diffuse light – is nature’s haunted house, a repository of our deepest fears. It is home to snakes that twitch down from cave ceilings, spiders the size of chihuahuas and scorpions with barbed tails – creatures we are evolutionarily hardwired to fear, because they so often killed our ancestors. Up until about 15,000 years ago, caves all over the world were the dwelling place of bears, lions and sabre-toothed tigers. Even today, when we peer underground, we feel the flickering dread of predators in the dark.As we evolved for life on the African savannah, where we hunted and foraged in daylight and where nocturnal predators stalked us in the night, darkness unnerved us. But the subterranean dark – “the sightless world” as Dante called it – is enough to cause our entire nervous system to splinter. The pioneering cave explorers of modern Europe imagined that a prolonged stay in subterranean darkness could permanently dismantle their psyches. One 17th-century writer described exploring a cave in Somerset: “We began to be afraid to visit it,” he wrote, “for although we entered it frolicsome and merry, yet we might return out of it sad and pensive and never more to be seen to laugh whilst we lived in the world.”In some ways, this has turned out to be true. Neuroscientists have demonstrated manifold ways in which prolonged immersion in absolute darkness can trigger psychological aberrations. In the 1980s, on an expedition into the Sarawak Chamber, the largest known cave chamber in the world, in the Mulu National Park in Borneo, a caver entered one of the gigantic caverns. It was big enough to fit 17 football fields. He lost track of the rock wall and, as he drifted through the interminable darkness, the caver fell into a kind of paralytic shock. Eventually he was found and guided back to the surface by his partners. Cavers have referred to such darkness-fuelled panic attacks as “the rapture”.The feeling of enclosure, too, leaves us unhinged. To be trapped in an underground chamber, our limbs restricted, cut off from light, with oxygen dwindling, may be the emperor of all nightmares. Down in any underground hollow we feel, if not a full tempest of panic, a reflexive tingle of not-quite-rightness, as we imagine ceilings and walls closing in on us. But ultimately, of course, it’s death we fear most. All of our aversions to the dark zone come together in the dread of our own mortality.Yet, when we crouch at the edge of the underground, we do descend. Virtually every known accessible cave on the planet contains the footprints of our ancestors. Archaeologists have belly-crawled through muddy passageways in the caves of France, swum down long subterranean rivers in Belize, and trekked for miles inside the limestone caves of Kentucky, and everywhere they have found fossilised traces of ancient people.And so, as I began to dissect my own preoccupation with the underground of New York, I found myself wrapped up in a much larger, older and more universal mystery. Despite the most basic evolutionary logic, we possess an impulse, buried in the core of our psyches, that draws us into the dark.Over the years, I have travelled widely, yo-yoing between New York and remote corners of the world, following every thread in our tangled relationship to this subterranean landscape. From dank corridors beneath modern cities I went into older and wilder hollows, and finally into the ancient darkness of natural caves.

Nobody has said a word to me, as I furtively steal their power while carefully keeping my face in neutral. The shop is busy with teenagers upgrading their iPhones and aggressively friendly staff, and the only still points are me and a man wearing three coats and broken flip-flops playing Candy Crush on an iPad. It is a quite lovely feeling to be, if not invisible, then at least translucent.A book called An Unexplained Death came out last month, and I reread it on my journey – it appears to be a true crime thriller about a man’s final days, but quickly and sneakily reveals itself to be a memoir of the writer, Mikita Brottman. Years before starting it, Brottman went to see a psychoanalyst because she’d started to feel invisible. “I appeared to be completely forgettable,” she writes. To be “invisible”, she elaborates, “feels a little like being a ghost – people don’t seem to notice or acknowledge my presence, or look right through me. This has its advantages, though. I often feel as though I can learn people’s secrets, and get away with anything.”I have been wallowing in this idea. Walking in the night alone, I feel a frantic kind of freedom, the eyes of strangers fall off me – I’m anti-climb paint. I can travel around peacefully, eat by myself, stand for as long as I want in front of a painting – and be ignored. I’ve never been pretty, but I have been young and thin, and I’ve always been female, and in that pie chart the central shape inevitably invites interest when seated alone. Walking near Central Park I remembered being on this street as a teenager, when a stranger pointed at my jeans and whispered: “Nice pussy.” No more.Which is why I basked in 50-year-old French author Yann Moix’s comments about how women stop being attractive after the age of 25. Questioned after his initial Marie Claire interview came out, where he said it wasn’t possible to love a woman over the age of 50 – “Too, too old. The body of a 25-year-old woman is extraordinary. The body of a woman of 50 is not extraordinary at all” – he decided to double down, further explaining he was only attracted to Asian women, because they offer an “extraordinary link with another cosmos”. Outraged, thousands shared photos of Halle Berry and Jennifer Aniston, as well as their own pert bodies, leading him to plead to the Times: “I would like 50-year-old women to stop sending me photos of their bottoms and breasts.” Which seems fair. Because why should anybody attempt to change his mind? Not only should we laugh at the arrogance of his bumptious racist sexism, but we should celebrate his point – that a moment comes in woman’s lives when they no longer have to engage with men like Moix.Until you are invisible to men like this, your body is theirs. You only get it back when they no longer find you sexy – and that is a relief like no other. How wonderful to walk down the street, whether in tight dress or muumuu (recently I have been wearing a lot of corduroy boiler suits) and not be constantly reassuring yourself, stiff-backed, not turning yourself into a human shield against strange men’s judgments, a running director’s commentary on how not to be a woman.A version of this can be seen in the New York press in its nutty attempts to shame congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a confused scrabbling for conflict that exposes the single way it is possible to be a woman in public. Up to 25, you are looked at – after that, you must not be too loud or too quiet, or smile too much or too little, or be too thin or too fat, or be good at dancing or be bad at dancing. It’s no wonder so many women are put off jobs in power it’s some wonder so many of us continue to internalise the sour taste we get of such exposure simply from walking down the street.I look at my body differently now that it is no longer being looked at. There is a dehumanising effect to being seen by men like Moix, as you stand outside yourself, considering their view. And while I understand the shock of women being ignored upon turning 50, 60, having lost the sexual capital they’d leaned into for years, surely there is a great deal of comfort for them in becoming invisible, too. Especially on hearing the limits of the alternative spelled out in French, an author saying books should be judged by their covers.Such dense bliss, this realisation that I can be invisible in a crowd, whether in this shop, where my face will be blurred in the background of two girls’ selfies, or in the street, where it should be possible to journey forward without the suspicion you’re trespassing in a stranger’s playground. Such relief to be the one looking, the one walking unseen, the person in the body that is no longer 25. It’s mine again.I have spent some time watching the video of the 64m fatberg discovered beneath the Esplanade in Sidmouth, Devon.

Submit your questions and ideas for our panel of experts to discuss what can be learnt from different approaches to educationDo you have good ideas about education, or want to ask a question about what it could like like in the future? If so, let us know by sharing your thoughts with our panel of education experts to examine what can be done to improve education, and make systems more equal. Whether you’re a teacher, student, academic, social worker, policymaker, parent, and wherever you are in the world, we want to hear from you.This is what Alex Beard, author of Natural Born Learners, and one of our panellists for this podcast, has to say:“Most schools today are not teaching kids how to learn. We lack a common understanding of what education is and what purpose it serves. We set national targets and arrange institutions and organise people so that they can deliver on those targets. This managerial thinking has been around for 100 years. But by standardising things in this way across classrooms, you undermine the efforts of educators.”In an increasingly interdependent world, it’s vital that we strive to understand not just what it is that makes other societies tick, but how others – be they British, Japanese, German or Argentinian – endeavour to solve the same problems that we all share. In this month’s podcast, we will be focusing on the issue of education, and how we as a global community can improve standards of education for children of all nationalities, genders, ethnicities and economic backgrounds.What are the techniques and methods we can all use to reform education models? How far are they needed, and how far can they stretch? Wendy Kopp explains the extent of the issue in her article ‘It’ll take a village to reform global education’:“More than 60 percent of primary school children in low- and middle- income countries do not reach a minimum proficiency in reading and math. We’re even further from ensuring the world’s children gain the competencies and dispositions necessary to shape a better future for themselves and all of us.”One thing is clear: the learning crisis is severe. But the conversation on education still needs to shift towards an understanding that this is a crisis that needs fixing – we know where we want to get to, but we don’t yet know how to get there. Of course, what works in one country might not work entirely in another, but recognising that there are other ways to do things might be a good place to start.What are the common issues we all face? What approaches have you seen implemented, or helped to implement, and what beneficial changes have been brought about in the systems you work in?Now we’d like to hear from you.

Readers have been debating Brexit the morning after the prime minister survived a confidence vote I think the prime minister just wants to do this “reaching out” as a PR exercise at the end of which she can announce “I tried, but no one else came up with another answer that respects the referendum... So you have accept my deal.”Her notorious rigidity is a major part of the problem. She fundamentally lacks the qualities to move this forward. Although she cannot be removed, she has to be circumvented to allow other options to be explored. SnagaThe purpose of May’s little speech last night was to play to the gallery of Daily Mail readers and to set the scene for blaming Brexit on the Labour Party. At a time when she needed to speak to the nation she was as isive as ever. GiantrobotThis is possibly the most abject failure of the British political system since the civil war. It’s the very definition of a constitutional crisis. The fact that Parliament can claim to have confidence in the government says that Parliament itself is broken. The citizens of the UK need a means of dissolving Parliament. helicanIt appears that May wants to have talks but doesn’t want to concede anything. Of course a second referendum should be on the table. The talks may conclude that it shouldn’t happen, but surely that is the whole point of talks.On Jeremy Corbyn’s refusal to meet unless she ruled out no deal, she said, “the door is always open.” Well, there’s no point having an open door if she doesn’t have an open mind. BellaTheCookCorbyn and the shadow cabinet absolutely right to insist the dangerous, flailing and failing May takes no deal off the table before they engage in any talks. May is totally responsible for this disaster and in the power of the DUP whose agenda cares nothing for the well being of the whole nation.The contempt with which May and the likes of Michael Gove talk of Corbyn is disgusting considering the harm created by Tories to our declining economy. They have made us the laughing stock of Europe. SissyJupe20May has no idea how to compromise and isn’t about to start now unless her hand is forced. The opposition parties should now unite behind Corbyn’s refusal to have a dialogue until no deal is taken off the table. At the very least they could extract from her a binding vote on it in the Commons.Ultimately though, we saw yesterday that the DUP can call time on her leadership whenever they want, so I assume they’ll be telling her what to do from now on. smazakIt’s time for Theresa May to abandon her red lines. Otherwise she’s merely trying to share blame. Without some gesture from her to indicate a willingness to actually change something, “nothing has changed”. PaulB1I don’t agree with Corbyn’s stance on Brexit but his insistence on Maybot taking “no deal” off the table is absolutely right. Impossible to talk while this vile dictatorial PM arrogantly refuses to listen to anyone except her rapidly shrinking team of sycophants. darquangeI am absolutely furious, that a bunch of self important, over privileged MPs are trying to strip young people of the same opportunities that I had. Its what you expect from the Tories who have always been the party of grumpy old men and busybodies who want to control everyone else. But what with Labour? SporadicWitIt’s beyond disingenuous to claim that Labour don’t have a plan. During the transition period, Labour want to remain in the customs union and the single market, abiding by the rules of both. Longer terms they seek to negotiate a new UK-EU customs union to avoid tariffs and prevent a hard border in Ireland. That seems like a sensible approach – maintain the status quo, but leave, allowing us time to transition slowly. We would be able to leave the customs union at any time, once we’ve begun the separation process. SharkcustardWell over 500 MPs want a no deal taken off the table. For the first time in this Brexit mess May should show good faith and stop the bullying. If she doesn’t then the short to medium problems will affect those with a bit of money dissatisfied with the increased hassle and cost of travel – and all of the other problems that come with a no deal. Those with no money will be worse off in the longer term. So many of her natural supporters will be immediately affected and they will punish her if her brinkmanship doesn’t work, as it’s only in her power to take a no deal off the table. jonniestewpot"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e438fd3a9e2a7f0009581f1713fab34a06e6c096/323_189_2986_1791/master/2986.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1743790e8b2a52cd917be78270443db3","title":"john bercow remain speaker brexit bias","story":"Friends say he could exercise right to remain in Commons chair in face of threat to withhold peerage over alleged Brexit ‘bias’The Speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow, is considering abandoning his plans to step down this summer after cabinet ministers threatened to deny him a peerage because of his alleged “bias” against the government over Brexit.Friends of the Speaker who have been in touch with him in the last 48 hours told the Observer that Bercow is now “seriously reflecting” on whether to stay on – possibly until 2022.Government sources briefed last week that someone who had “cheated centuries of procedure” should not expect to be elevated to the House of Lords.One source who knows Bercow’s thinking said that if the Conservative government was seeking to “punish” the Speaker for how he conducted parliamentary business – and themselves defy centuries of convention under which Speakers are granted peerages on retirement – he could well exercise his right to remain in the Commons chair until the end of this parliament, rather than leave soon after Brexit.Allies of Bercow said he fundamentally disapproved of attempts to bully him into toeing the government line.The extraordinary row between the Speaker and the government is further poisoning the atmosphere in parliament as it grapples with the Brexit crisis, following the crushing defeat last week of Theresa May’s Brexit deal.Bercow is seen by many Tories as too sympathetic to Labour and those seeking to soften or thwart Brexit. As senior Tory and Labour MPs step up efforts over the coming days to seize control over the Brexit process from the government, Bercow’s role will be pivotal. A senior MP at the centre of moves to ensure parliament takes control of Brexit said: “The Speaker will play a critical role in the coming days, selecting amendments and determining parliamentary business. If ministers thought it was a good idea to put his back up they may regret it.”Peerages for retiring Speakers are normally approved by No 10 as a matter of course. But a Downing Street source said on Friday that it was the prime minister’s view that “there is no such thing as an automatic peerage”, even for a retiring Speaker.Bercow, who infuriated May and the Tories earlier this month by departing from convention to allow MPs to take control of Commons business through permitting a controversial amendment, will be thrown back into the centre of the Brexit debate this week when a cross-party group of MPs led by Labour MP Yvette Cooper and Tory Nick Boles intend to hand parliament the power to delay Brexit – a move vehemently opposed by the government and leading Brexiters. Under the latest cross-party strategy, MPs would be able to delay Britain’s EU exit day if no Brexit deal were in place by the end of February.As Speaker, Bercow holds the key to the plan, as only he can rule that the strategy should be debated and voted on by MPs. Another explosive proposal being discussed by MPs would allow them to pass Brexit motions without first winning majority support. Rebels have drawn up an amendment that would allow a motion backed by a minority of 300 MPs to take precedence over government business. This would allow backbench MPs to propose plans blocking a no-deal Brexit.After the crushing defeat of her plan last Tuesday, and an unsuccessful Labour attempt to oust the government in a no-confidence motion, the prime minister said she was willing to talk to opposition MPs, including party leaders, in an attempt to find a way forward. Tomorrow May will make statements to parliament on the way forward on Brexit and table a fresh motion which MPs can amend. The next key votes will take place on 29 January.Labour deputy leader Tom Watson said yesterday the party had a duty to talk to Theresa May if she was prepared to enter into an “intelligent conversation” on Brexit.Speaking at the Fabian Society’s new year conference in London, he said: “We are obligated, I think, through our sense of patriotism and respect for democracy to have an intelligent conversation on Brexit with Theresa May if she is offering it. But there is no bargain-basement Brexit on our agenda.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2afa478ea38897c4670bdee8f9c0b617dd598064/0_206_5485_3291/master/5485.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=02c02ee4559372bd50f7ecd152c892b1","title":"ministers second brexit referendum lib dems","story":"Vince Cable says move follows cross-party talks on Brexit deadlock optionsCabinet ministers involved in cross-party talks on how to break the Brexit deadlock have given the first indication that they are prepared to examine plans for a potential second referendum on the UK’s departure from the EU, according to the Liberal Democrat leader, Sir Vince Cable.The offer to examine a possible timetable for a second vote drawn up by the Lib Dems was made during discussions between senior Liberal Democrats and two cabinet ministers involved in the talks, Michael Gove and David Lidington, in the Cabinet Office on Thursday morning.While Theresa May’s government remains strongly opposed to the idea of returning the issue of Brexit to the electorate, the revelation by Cable shows that ministers are determined to look at a wide range of ideas being put forward by opposition parties.The government insists that any referendum that could reverse the 2016 decision to leave the EU would be a betrayal of the will of the people. It has also suggested that a second vote would take up to a year to prepare and conduct. But the Liberal Democrats have produced draft legislation which they say would allow one to be held far sooner: before the next European elections in May.Cable spoke in the Commons to the prime minister on Wednesday evening, after Labour’s no-confidence motion was defeated and soon after May had said she was ready to open talks on a way forward with opposition MPs, including party leaders. Cable stressed in those talks with May, which were described as “polite and cordial”, that his party’s central demand was for a second referendum.While May reiterated her opposition to the idea to Cable, senior Lib Dems then repeated the demand at the subsequent meeting with Gove and Lidington on Thursday. The Lib Dems say Gove asked at the second meeting to see the detailed plans, suggesting an active interest.On Saturday night Cable released to the Observer the text of a letter he has sent to Lidington following the two rounds of discussions. It states: “Further to your meeting with my deputy Jo Swinson, chief whip Alistair Carmichael and Brexit spokesperson Tom Brake, I write – as requested – with further details as to how we consider a referendum could be brought about in May.“As you will know, we have published on a cross-party basis two bills. The first is a two-clause bill which could be enacted within a week, to enable the Electoral Commission to begin consultation on a referendum question. The second, a substantive referendum bill. Dominic Grieve tabled these in presentation bills in parliament last week.“With sufficient political will, a referendum bill could be passed in very short order – perhaps within days. However, we estimate that even without complete consensus across the house, legislation could be passed in six weeks and a referendum could be brought about within 16 weeks. This would enable a ten-week total campaign period (to include designation of campaigns). Proceeding with a people’s vote on this basis is now the only remaining lifeline for the negotiated deal between the UK and the EU27, since no parliamentary majority can be assembled for it without a referendum.”Cable told the Observer: “Where there is a will, there is a way. If the government moves quickly, as we believe it should, it will be possible to conclude the Brexit story one way or another before the scheduled European parliamentary elections. While Liberal Democrats firmly reject her deal, we have no doubt the prime minister would campaign vigorously for public approval of it. We have long believed giving the public the final say on this deal is the only way forward. This timetable paves the way.”Lord Tyler, the architect of the Lib Dem timetable, said it was wrong to suggest a referendum would take a year. While it could not take place before the scheduled exit date of 29 March, it could be conducted in a far shorter timeframe than 12 months, although this would involve delaying Brexit.Tyler said: “A referendum can be brought about quickly when parliament determines to make it happen. The process for the 1997 devolution referendums took place in 17 weeks from the bill hitting parliament to people casting their ballots.”Government sources said that any willingness to examine the plans of opposition parties did not indicate a preparedness to adopt them. Downing Street again ruled out Theresa May ever backing a second referendum."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/01f14ba3f573909b696d6c8a55de56c1b01d3f50/565_637_4418_2651/master/4418.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cce46e6a6df5656e18cfa5136ab1eb95","title":"corbyn to back no deal brexit block","story":"Labour is considering a proposal that would force Theresa May to extend Britain’s membership of the EUJeremy Corbyn is poised to back a plan to block a no-deal Brexit as pressure builds within Labour and the trade unions for a delay to Britain’s EU departure.It is understood that the leader and his shadow cabinet team are preparing to support a proposal that would force Theresa May to request an extension to Britain’s EU membership should no Brexit deal be agreed by early March.The plan would need the endorsement of the Labour frontbench to have a chance of being passed when the next round of critical votes takes place next week. While no final decision has been taken, senior figures said the move was in line with Corbyn’s demand that May take a no-deal Brexit “off the table”.The deliberations come with the Brexit options narrowing for Labour’s leadership amid an internal battle over whether it should back a second referendum. Having tried and failed to secure an election, figures in the party say the choice is now between a Norway-style soft Brexit, which would effectively have to include free-movement rules, and another public vote.The shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, who has been trying to keep open the option of a second vote, repeated the demand on Saturday. “A public vote has to be an option for Labour,” he told a Fabian Society conference. “After all, deeply embedded in our values are internationalism, collaboration and cooperation with our European partners.”Labour MPs are planning to ambush the leadership at a gathering of the parliamentary party a week on Monday. MPs want to force a debate at the meeting on the party’s position on a second referendum.However, several shadow ministers have told senior party figures in the last week that they would resign should the party back another referendum. “There are an awful lot of Labour MPs, even some who backed remain, who just aren’t there yet,” said a senior party source. “It is a real political problem. They might get there, but there is some way to go.”Many figures are coalescing around a delay to article 50, the legal process that dictates that Britain will leave the EU – with or without a deal – at the end of March. Writing in the Observer, Dave Prentis, the leader of Britain’s biggest union, Unison, says the time has come for a suspension of article 50. He suggests that a so-called people’s vote should be backed only if a softer Brexit cannot be agreed.“The chances of forcing an election anytime soon are receding,” he writes. “Other options now have to come into play ... It’s vital immediate steps are taken to extend article 50. Not to stop Brexit, but to ensure there’s time to force a change of government, or find a solution parliament can back.“A customs union would minimise the risk of a hard border in Northern Ireland … A Norway-like deal, allowing the UK to participate in the single market too, would further minimise the risk to our fragile economy and to employment rights.”In a sign that there is still some way to go before Labour backs a second referendum, he says such a policy should only be adopted “if other avenues fail”.Under a plan devised by the former Tory minister Nick Boles and Corbyn’s former leadership rival Yvette Cooper, parliamentary rules would be temporarily suspended, allowing parliament to pass a law forcing May to try to delay article 50 if no deal looked likely. It would require frontbench Labour support, which is now looking likely.With anger among some members about Brexit growing, several party sources suggested that Labour’s huge membership had begun to fall. Several party sources said that the number of paying members had fallen well below 500,000 – meaning tens of thousands had left. However, the suggestions were denied by a senior Labour source, who said: “We are proud of our mass and vibrant membership and claims about this sort of drop-off are just wrong.”The union movement is also split on Brexit. Manuel Cortes, general secretary of the Transport Salaried Staffs’ Association, said remaining in the EU was the “best outcome for working people”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/95b92067b9a142c18319fac1d183f1a97631439e/0_231_5931_3558/master/5931.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1a8575438cc848cab5c7f150922fae39","title":"norway plus uk brexit not silver bullet","story":"Trying to emulate the Norwegian model will only disillusion and betray both the Leave and Remain campsNorway is known for its fjords and mountains, its coastline and the mystical northern lights. It is a fitting backdrop then for the Brexit saga’s latest myth, which centres around the Scandinavian country’s close but separate relations with the EU – an idea for a new deal being marketed as Norway Plus.Norway’s EU deal is not something we can simply copy and paste. Joining the European Free Trade Association (Efta) bloc would require the approval of all four Efta members: Norway, Switzerland, Iceland and Liechtenstein. Senior Norwegian politicians and business figures could not have been clearer in rejecting the idea as “neither in Norway’s nor the UK’s interest”.Even if we could negotiate our way into Efta, we would not want to. A Norway-style deal with the EU is a lose-lose compromise that means giving up our existing democratic influence in the European parliament, the commission and the council for nothing in return. Breaking almost every single promise made by the Leave campaign, we would continue abiding by EU rules and regulations, including free movement, paying large budget contributions, and we would have no formal oversight of new laws handed down by the European Court of Justice via the Efta court.Instead of continuing to lead in the European institutions we helped to build, we would become entirely subservient to new rules created solely in the interests of the remaining 27 member states. Our only influence will come through a network of professional lobbyists whose job it will be to take European politicians out for lunch. These people will not be representatives of the unemployed in seaside towns or the former industrial workers who voted for Brexit, but Oxbridge graduates working for multinational corporations to chip away at social protections and workers’ rights. This may work fine for Norway, as a small nation with generally good salaries for all workers, but for Britain, Europe’s second largest but highly unequal economy, it would be a humiliation that works against the interests of those the Brexit project claims to represent.Norway Plus is a false compromise. It wrongly assumes that the right answer to the Brexit problem must be found somewhere between two opposite poles. When one person tells you that grass is green and another tells you it is red, you would be foolish to conclude that grass is actually brown. Similarly, when half of the country concludes that Brexit is good and the other half concludes it is bad, the answer is not to take the worst elements of both in a fudge compromise. This kind of muddled thinking would be a historic mistake. Instead of upsetting only Remainers or only Leavers, we would disillusion them both.Most importantly, this new Viking takeover is a fundamentally dishonest solution to what happened in 2016. It gives the pretence of respecting the vote but, in reality, it is an establishment stitch-up made in the backrooms of Westminster that would honour exactly zero of the promises made by the Leave campaign. It is better to confront the issues raised by Brexit voters and show them the respect of honest disagreement than to give them this Judas kiss.Norway Plus may feel good to voters at first, but they will soon see it as betrayal. Better to argue that free movement has been a force for good, that we find strength in pooling our sovereignty and that our problems result from national failure, than to build up resentment by taking this easy way out.As it stands, a Norway-style Brexit has no mandate. Whether you are a Leaver or a Remainer, you did not votefor the government to impose a settlement that means obeying all the rules and regulations of the EU, with no democratic influence over how they are made. If, over the coming weeks, parliamentary arithmetic means that Norway Plus looks like the most likely means of achieving consensus, it could only be done democratically if it gets ratification in a people’s vote.David Lammy has been Labour MP for Tottenham since 2000"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/019c75960f4e6cee9eafc4ad8a987736a43f9175/0_145_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fac0bed024bcf31278517a3fc68c0959","title":"ministers urged halt right buy council homes rented","story":"The damning findings of an analysis of Freedom of Information data also show that:• Tens of millions of pounds are being paid by local authorities to rent former council homes in order to house growing numbers of homeless families• Some councils have bought back their former homes at more than six times the amount they sold them for• Hundreds of private landlords now own five or more right-to-buy properties. There are several London boroughs where more than half the houses sold through the policy are now in the hands of private landlords. Private renters have to pay more than people living in council-owned properties.Labour London assembly member Tom Copley, who released the report containing the new data, said the findings provided fresh evidence for why right-to-buy should be scrapped in the capital.“Something has gone very wrong when tens of thousands of homes built to be let at social rents for the public good are now being rented out at market rates for private profit, sometimes back to the very councils that were forced to sell them,” he said.Around 466 iniduals or companies have the leasehold for at least five former council homes each, while there are 2,333 right-to-buy properties where the local authority pays private landlords to house homeless families across London. Councils have spent £22m a year on renting back properties they once owned to use as temporary accommodation.“Ealing council passionately believes in council house building, which is why we have launched the biggest programme in London,” he said. “Between increased land prices, a long-term cap on borrowing and being forced to give up much of the receipts from the sale of council homes, the system as it stands is entirely rigged against local authorities who wish to build new council homes.”According to the Resolution Foundation thinktank, local authorities and housing associations in England have built one home for every two sold under the right-to-buy scheme.Jon Sparkes, chief executive of homelessness charity Crisis, said: “Social housing is more affordable and more secure than private renting, and provides much-needed stability for those at risk of homelessness. It is unacceptable to see what little social housing options are available are being removed.“What we need to see from the government going forward is suspension of the right-to-buy while it invests to build the 90,000 social homes needed in England each year to keep up with demand.”Lindsay Judge, senior policy analyst at the Resolution Foundation, said: “It’s likely to be too late for a ban on right-to-buy having a significant impact on London, as the remaining social housing stock is largely concentrated among low-income households. But what these figures do show is the acute need to build more homes in the capital across a range of tenures, including social housing.”Polly Neate, chief executive at Shelter, called for 3.1 million new social homes to address the housing crisis. “While right-to-buy has helped many families get on to the housing ladder, just three years after it was introduced in 1980, the supply of properties available for social rent had halved – pulling up the ladder for future generations,” she said. “We’re now in the ridiculous position of seeing local authorities across the country, not just in London, renting former council properties back from private landlords, at great expense, in order to house growing numbers of homeless families.”Government officials said right-to-buy purchasers must repay a portion of their discount to their council if they sell within the first five years. And those who sell within 10 years of purchase must offer their local authority first refusal to buy it back.Kit Malthouse, the housing minister, said: “Under our right-to-buy scheme, over 100,000 social housing tenants have now got a foot on the property ladder since 2010, including more than 17,000 in London. We have lifted the housing revenue account borrowing cap for local authorities so they can build more houses in areas where they are most needed, and delivered 88,000 new affordable homes in London since 2010.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/757d734a73d3f19aca9c5c9e2c492fd4f917fbeb/1_303_3750_2250/master/3750.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=de56ef72a58993cbd368e1376daf39eb","title":"england south africa netball quad series match report","story":"England’s hopes of claiming their first Quad Series title appear in tatters after South Africa tore up the script at London’s Copper Box Arena.From the high of a repeat 13-goal drubbing of New Zealand in Liverpool last week to this shock 48-45 loss to outsiders South Africa, England now face the daunting prospect of not only having to defeat Australia on Sunday but needing to do so by at least five goals to have any chance of achieving Quad Series history.South Africa lost the opening match of this tournament 62-45 to Australia. Here they were a different team all over England from the outset to turn all permutations on their head. The South Africans led by four at half-time and expertly held their composure despite raucous local support.This result leaves Australia, who hung on 53-50 to hand New Zealand successive defeats, in pole position with a 10-goal advantage over England. Perhaps England were guilty of complacency of glancing ahead to the Australian challenge. England found themselves behind throughout and were frequently rattled.The normally composed shooter Jo Harten (1822) botched the odd sitter from under the hoop and spilt the ball on another occasion. Jade Clarke had one pass tipped near the death. Others took turns remonstrating with the officials as frustrations bubbled to the surface.The England coach, Tracey Neville, lamented a poor defensive start and squandered possession which allowed South Africa’s confidence to grow, but offered no excuses for her side’s poor performance.“The girls played an outstanding match last Sunday. They’ve had plenty of rest coming into this series. What it shows to them is world-class teams need to constantly keep coming out with stellar performances. We learned a big lesson today but it’s better to learn it now than later,” Neville said. “There were times we could have won that game so I’ve got to look at our own performance.”South Africa had beaten England 13 times previously – the last a three-goal Quad Series win two years ago in New Zealand – but the hosts, now Commonwealth Games champions, were widely expected to comfortably pull away.“You never want to lose but if they can’t pick themselves up for another day tomorrow then they’re not world-class players,” Neville added. “This is a test of character – it’s about mental and physical strength.”Australia are missing star shooter and captain Caitlin Bassett with a broken forearm, and wing defence Gabi Simpson due to a leg injury, yet after two straight wins they are now firm favourites. England will need every soul in what will be a sold-out arena to take the title for the first time.The Australia coach, Lisa Alexander, turned up the heat on England too. “The pressure is right on England,” she said. “They’ve beaten New Zealand by 13 and we’ve beaten them by three so the pressure is on them.”The South African coach and former Australian mentor, Norma Plummer, predicts those in green and gold will emerge victorious. “I reckon the Aussies will take it,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e0fafc7704ff975c479f84b4a64eb7ba5f55df3e/0_179_4306_2583/master/4306.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=89059332c1bf4ecf0db861fbab33255f","title":"roger federer v stefanos tsitsipas australian open 2019 live","story":"It’s 9.30pm in Melbourne and there is another game on after this, which might finish around noon tomorrow at this rate. Fed comes in behind a second serve but needlessly whacks it straight into the net when he must have been eyeing a winner. Tsitsipas volleys his way to winning the game, he his improving as the game goes on.Intense stuff form Federer as he ensures Tsitsipas feels the heat in Melbourne as he takes the game with little fuss. Here we go again! It is pretty draining watching this match, so God knows how the lads on the court are feeling. A bad backhand from Tsitsipas needlessly sends a shot wide under little pressure but he makes amends to level things up at 30-30 and then takes the game. There are some very lively ducks or something in the background in Melbourne which is adding a weird background noise. TIE BREAK! Federer starts it off by woefully miscueing a shot into the stands pretty much. Not how you want to start on your serve. Tsitsipas on the other hand smashes two aces, the second just about kissing the line, as proved by Hawkeye. Fed gets back into it as the Greek’s inside-out forearm heads out to make it 3-1. The Swiss then offers up the look of a man about to kill after a bad call from the umpire results in the point being replayed. Much to his relief, he wins that one. Federer levels things up with a sublime backhand down the line. Wonderful. With the pressure back on Tsitsipas he holds his nerve in a rally, ending with Fed finding the net and then he makes it 5-3 with a passing forearm. He then keeps his calm to let a volley pass him, in the knowledge it was heading just out. Tsitsipas serves for the set ... and wins it!Tsitsipas serves to stay in the set and does so with aplomb as takes the game to love. No break point chances for Fed here. Another tie-break. Abhijato says: “I wanted to comment on the camera angles used in this Open. They often cut away to the view from just behind the players, which gives us a more intimate feel of the way the game is being played. The overhead shot often seems to make the ball easier to see, but the use of the court cameras should be more encouraged - the awkward bounce and height from the best shots is captured through these frames. If the broadcasters stream these games online, maybe there could be a stream permanently from these cameras, accompanied by nothing but the sounds of the game with optional commentary? I would pay to watch them any day.”I have found some of the TV directing very strange. Keep it simple, lads. A lesser man might have collapsed under the pressure from Federer but Tsitsipas is giving everything to stay in this game, so much so his shoelace has broken. A quick change of footwear means we are back playing but it is business as usual for Federer as he takes the game. After playing Come On Eileen, we are back to the real business of tennis. There is some creaking in Tsitsipas’ game, he has put in a lot of effort to be fair, and after a stunning rally he hits a backhand long giving a break point. The Greek ensures we go to Deuce with a big serve. Federer gets another chance of a break but a serve down the middle does the job for Tsitsipas to make it eight break points Fed has failed to take in the match. He gets the chance of a ninth and misses out again with a poor shot from the baseline. A tenth comes immediately thanks to a cracking shot across court but it is not taken as Tsitsipas volleys a winner. Great endeavour from the Greek, who then gets his own chance to win the game which he does take. Bish, bash, bosh. Federer wins the game to love. Great serving from him today. Federer lures Tsitsipas to then net then flashes a forehand past him. Federer does similar again but this time beats him with cunning rather than power to make it 0-30. The Greek recovers with a couple of heaving shots to level things up and head to Deuce thanks to a stunning backhand down the line from Federer following one of the match’s better rallies. Ooooof! Deuce #3 sees Tsitsipas volley his way to advantage but he then gets unlucky on the next point as a Federer shot clips the net and he just gets it back over but the Swiss smashes a winner. Deuce #5 gives Federer break point but his backhand, when he has a chance of winning the game, goes very long. Don’t worry, there is always Deuce #6 to bring this to a conclusion and it does as Federer sends the ball into the net. Still no breaks of serve. Federer has won 10 points in a row on serve and takes the game. Federer is looking the more likely winner at the moment, I would say.Will I learn how to spell Tsitsipas off the top of my head before this match finishes? No probably not. The last break points on serve were in the opening game of the match but we have another! Federer brings Tsitsipas to the net and then smashes a forehand straight back past him. The Greek takes us to Deuce despite looking trouble during the crucial rally but it is Fed who overhits a forehand. A review is called for from Tsitsipas and he is proven right that Federer’s shot was just out. But we are back to Deuce. The Greek then sends a backhand long and Fed has another chance to break his younger opponent but his return smashes into the net. Federer looks in a good position to break Tsitsipas but stopped when chasing down a drop shot even though he could have got there, even Fed himself looks confused. Serve is held by the Greek after three break points. Lively.Federer takes the games to love. Easy peasy.Tony emails: “Re the morons in the crowd shouting out during rallies - surely the stewards, or indeed other members of the crowd, can identify the loud-mouthed miscreants and have them removed? Seeing a few idiots frogmarched out of the stands might discourage the others?“PS what a terrific match this is!”It is a great match and to we should ensure it continues in this way by having the idiots removed quickly and in as embarrassing a fashion as possible. This is not going to be a quick match, is it? Both players are looking in stupendous form and know the other’s weakness, which is making it compelling viewing. The Greek ensures that no service games have been lost as he takes the game 40-15, concluding with a dramatic volley. We might be here for quite a while here. Federer is looking more and more clinical as the match progresses but Tsitsipas shows what he is made of with a great backhand return to a serve and then Federer messes up a drop shot to make it 30-30. Fed takes the game. Tsitsipas tries to regain his composure after a whirlwind first game of the second set as he serves himself back into the game, making it 30-0 with a great backhand volley to keep things interesting and he also takes the game to love. Lovely stuff. The Greek had a bit of a chat with the umpire there as it is the second time someone has shouted out from the crowd with an erroneous call of “Out!”. The umpire has warned the crowd but they do not seem intelligent enough to understand it. Federer takes the game to love.Tsitsipas starts the tie-break by taking the first two points to put the pressure back on Federer. A bad backhand from the Greek misses its mark and levels it at 2-2 but he follows that up with an ace. It’s 3-3 thanks to a great volley from Federer forcing his opponent to send the ball long in response. Federer shouts “Come on!” when going 4-3 up to show how tough it is out there and there is a similar shout from Tsitsipas when he immediately levels things. Plenty of quality and commitment in the tie-break. Federer sends a forehand long to make it 5-5 but then Tsitsipas can’t return the following serve. But some positive tennis from the Greek allows him to volley a winner from the net to level things up. Federer miscues a forehand to give his opponent Set Point but there is no chance he is giving him a chance with a superb serve which kisses the line. Set Point is then with Federer but he fails to take it and then smashes a forehand into the net for no reason from the baseline, leaving Tsitsipas a chance to take the set but we all know that is not happening on Federer’s serve as he volleys a winner and then a drop shot leaves him on the brink but he sends his shot well wide to make it 10-10. It goes to 11-11 as the Greek hits the net with a backhand. It’s Set Point once again for Fed as he doesn’t mess about with a forehand. Federer then wins the first set after some tosser in the crowd shouts “Out!”. Tsitsipas is not happy but those are the breaks when idiots are around.Federer has been put under plenty of pressure and a drop shot from Tsitsipas forces him to send his response into the net. The Swiss does not worry and wins the next two points thanks to some great first serving. Here comes a tie-break.Tsitsipas loses his first point on his serve for a while as he fails to execute a backhand, which hits the net. He regains his composure and sends some powerful shots Federer’s way which he just can’t fire back and the Greek takes the game with a great backhand volley at the net, made all the better as he was falling over at the time.Needing to win the game to stay in the set brings out the best of Federer as he goes 30-0 up but then Tsitsipas shows his worth with a great backhand down the line to get back into the game. A stunning rally results in Federer smashing a winner which flicks the line, before the Swiss takes the game.Federer is getting moved around the court here by Tsitsipas and he does not like it. His forehand is coming under pressure and even his backhand is being undermined. Tsitsipas wins the game and has now won the last 13 points on his serve.New balls in Melbourne result in Federer misjudging their bounce and firing one well off court. He produces his first ace in response but then his fifth forced error of the game lets his opponent back in and Tsitsipas takes us to Deuce with a stunning backhand out of Federer’s reach across court from the baseline. Federer gets into the net to earn advantage and then takes the game.Tsitsipas is targeting the forehand and it is working for him. Not to mention he stunning ace down the middle to make it 40-0. He then finishes off by putting plenty of spin on a shot and Federer can only smash it into the net. We’ve got a game on here. There is a challenge from Tsitipas on a Federer serve to get the game going. The Greek has a chat with the umpire and in the end loses his challenge. Federer makes Tsitipas move around the court, almost playing with him but the 20-year-old gets his own back with a stunning forehand down the line to make it 40-30 and then Federer miscues one for Deuce. The Swiss regains his composure to take the game.No messing about from Tsitsipas in response as he puts the pressure back on his more esteemed colleague forcing a couple of errors and then taking the game to love with a lovely volley at the net which Federer cannot get to in time.A decent backhand rally gets Federer’s second service game underway. Both men have superb backhands like they’re using wands. The Swiss wins that challenge and then shows Tsitsipas that he cannot be lobbed as the Greek sends a lob long. In the end Federer takes the game to love to show he is not messing about. He has only conceded a point in his opening two service games.The Greek seems to be targeting Federer’s forehand as he eases through his second service game by winning with minimal fuss on this occasion. All those nerves are now being lost by Tsitsipas. Federer’s first service game is a bit of a calmer affair as the Swiss smashes some clinical shots to ensure his opponent knows how ferocious this game is going to be. It was certainly quicker than the first game of the match.Tsitsipas gets us going and puts Federer under plenty of early pressure but Federer is unflustered by a couple of big serves. Tsitipas is nervous and gets a time warning at break point but recovers to take Federer to Deuce. Federer almost takes advantage with a superb shot across the court but it is inches out but an error from the Greek levels things up. Tsitsipas double faults because he fails to take his serve in time and then sends it long without option of a second one. On the upside he then has an out call overturned for a serve as it just kissed the line. This is a fascinating opening game, as Federer takes the game back to Deuce with some superb play at the net which Tsitipas cannot cope with. In the end Tsitipas holds the game. More of this, please. Barty got the better of Sharapova earlier ...They are both out on court and are knocking up a bit. Some lovely early backhands to get you in the mood.Stefanos Tsitsipas comes into this game hoping that self-belief might be enough to see off Roger Federer but that might a bit of a stretch. The Greek is the 14th seed in Melbourne and is certainly capable of a shock but Federer is still looking superb at the ripe old age of 37 and no one would be surprised if he were to win his seventh Australian Open this time around.Tsitsipas has a potentially wonderful career ahead of him and a win today would certainly be a turning point. Could be a cracking game in store!"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eb71541c390e76451d18e2ce19619c8e9a19a338/0_410_5095_3056/master/5095.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=886986a38c0c2d83a1867aa535da8fa4","title":"until the lions akram khan review roundhouse modern masterpiece","story":"Roundhouse, LondonKhan performs in his intensely beautiful take on the Mahabharata for the last timeAkram Khan made Until the Lions to be performed in the magical, circular space of London’s Roundhouse some three years ago. It shone then, and after worldwide success in different arenas has returned home to cast its illuminating spell for a final time. Strikingly beautiful, poised somewhere between narrative and metaphor, it features only three dancers – Ching-Ying Chien, Joy Alpuerto Ritter and Khan himself – but is epic in conception, a myth transfigured for modern times.Seeing it now, you realise how much it is a transitional work, carrying Khan from the intricate solos and duets that made his name to the larger-scale vision of works such as Giselle for English National Ballet, which emphasises his choreographic importance in a future where he plans to dance less. It looks forward and back, containing both echoes of Khan’s earliest experience as a performer for Peter Brook and the first stirrings of his collaboration with the composer Vincenzo Lamagna, who provides the resonant, evocative score.Until the Lions takes its title and its inspiration from Karthika Naïr’s poetic reimagining of some tales from the Mahabharata, focusing on the women whose narratives peep around the epic’s corners. These are the lions, the hunted whose stories are lost because the hunters write the history. Here, they take the shape of Amba, a betrayed princess, abducted for obscure reasons by Bheeshma, who then will not marry her because he has taken a vow of celibacy. She swears revenge, undergoes suffering that unbalances the universe, then takes her own life in order to emerge as a warrior in male form, ready to kill the man who destroyed her life.It’s knotty stuff, and Khan’s achievement is to transform it into a series of powerful images. You might not understand every detail of the plot without reading the programme, but as he runs in circles with Ching-Ying’s prone body over his shoulder, you sense the outrage. Her despair, as she tries to make him marry her, is conveyed in a remarkable duet where they never quite embrace his arms encircle her without touching. Finally, she locks her legs around his waist and they move like a double-jointed creature, joined by a bond that can be torn apart but never broken.The most mysterious character is embodied by Ritter, both spirit and warrior, prowling around in steps that conjure animals and insects as well as the defiance of the fighter. Each dancer is quite distinctive Ching-Ying modulates from little-girl skips and hops, her hands like opening flowers, to gnarled, twisted resistance, her eyes rolling, her body shuddering, as she wills change. Khan brings an upright ferocity, a whirring strength to Bheeshma, a man constrained and warped by his promise.The intensity of these performances is underlined by every aspect of the piece. Tim Yip has turned the stage into the cut trunk of a tree that splits and rises as the world slips out of joint. The musicians and singers sit around the space, intervening in the action, providing an emphatic and glorious soundtrack. Michael Hulls’s lighting animates everything in searching shafts of ever-changing white light. The effect is transfixing, an hour that feels infinitely full of riches, an unforgettable roar."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4d387615cd1164bbb2741026a2e6a388e6244db4/609_196_887_532/master/887.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=938e459d7007428152f2829c07a8ff2e","title":"liv little its a big thing for a black woman to see yourself reflected back","story":"Women of colour need their own space, which is why Liv Little set up gal-dem. As part of our Tales of the everyday extraordinary series, we explore how she started a culturequake that’s been felt throughout the media ever since. All images captured on the Google Pixel 3 by Stephanie Sian SmithLiv Little walks into Radio 4’s Woman’s Hour office with a smile that is as big and bright as her red puffer coat, impressive considering how exhausted she is. We’re here to discuss the rise of women and non-binary people of colour in media, an industry in which Little has emerged as a bright new star. It’s the reason we asked her to be part of the  Labs’s and Google Pixel 3’s Tales of the everyday extraordinary series, where innately curious people discuss how they discover the extraordinary all around them. Little collapses into the waiting arms of a slouchy upholstered chair, humbly receiving congrats on the runaway success of her independent digital and print zine, gal-dem, from a producer who has popped in to say hi.In a year that has been “Feminist AF”. In the age of #MeToo, self care, #BlackGirlMagic and #GirlsDoingWhateverTheFuckTheyWant, it’s not surprising that 2018 has also been the year of Little and gal-dem. It’s hard to find a young woman who better sums up the cultural shift. Her publication, with a corrective emphasis on intersectional feminism, is produced by a team of outspoken, socially conscious, whip-smart young women and non-binary people of colour, from a range of socioeconomic backgrounds. It’s a refreshing change from the publishing world’s longstanding homogenous population of largely white, mostly cisgender, predominantly privileged and Oxbridge-educated citizenry.“I wanted to connect with other women and non-binary people of colour. I wanted it to be a free space where people can come and read about experiences like their own,” Little explains of gal-dem’s beginnings. “I realised that it’s a big thing for a black woman to see yourself reflected back.”Add Little to the list of young women interrogating and disrupting historically white, tough-to-break-into professions globally – women such as the newly elected 29-year-old Latinx US congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez or the black British book publisher Sharmaine Lovegrove.Little and gal-dem reflect the moment as much as they are the moment. And their rise coincides with a new wave of women and non-binary people of colour who felt their voices were not being heard in the everyday, so did something extraordinary to get it out there – notably carving space for themselves in the UK media world including Slay in Your Lane authors Yomi Adegoke and Elizabeth Uviebinené, journalist Afua Hirsch and the influencer and body positivity activist Chidera “The Slumflower” Eggerue.Meanwhile, gal-dem’s growing team of more than 15 editors, writers and assistants have been juggling projects that rival those of legacy publishing giants with exponentially larger staffs – a truly extraordinary achievement. There was the takeover of the  Weekend Magazine in August, during a month when black women ruled the September glossy monthly covers. And then there was the summer launch of gal-dem’s partnership with Liberty London and Dialogue Books to create a literature course, aptly titled Rewriting the Canon and dedicated to iconic authors of colour. Add to that an exhibition they curated in June about the Windrush generation for City Hall and a week-long pop-up with Penguin in November to celebrate the launch of Michelle Obama’s global phenomenon of a book, Becoming. The pop-up featured events that centred on various themes in the former first lady’s memoir – from a discussion about black motherhood to a talk with businesswoman and activist Gina Miller.This hardly scratches the surface of the long list of wins gal-dem has had since Little first launched the project as a student at the University of Bristol back in 2015.Little had an “overwhelmingly positive” childhood, growing up in south-east London with a close relationship to her Buddhist mother and human rights worker aunt (her mum’s identical twin). She didn’t experience the negative and isolating aspects of being a woman of colour navigating white environments until she started university, where she studied politics and sociology. “My childhood was very much about me being comfortable enough to know that my voice is as important as anyone else’s. And then I went to uni and saw a disparity in circumstances that I had never seen before. I was around the super elite for the first time – people who had cards with family bank names on them, people with very conservative beliefs. It was different from what I was used to back home with my mum’s erse roster of friends. I was in a place where I was studying things and suddenly I had this feeling of: ‘Why is there no space for me?’”It was a question women of colour were asking the world over – using everyday, free platforms such as Instagram to create and market the kinds of extraordinary imagery and storytelling they wanted to see, but couldn’t find in mainstream media. And so gal-dem became the UK’s biggest success story in what emerged as a global wave of independent upstarts by women and non-binary people of colour, including Well Read Black Girl – a US-based online book club and content platform-turned Brooklyn literary festival – and Azeema Mag, an annual print zine dedicated to women within the Menasa region (Middle East, north Africa and south Asia).Now, gal-dem is not just a space for Little, but hundreds of contributors around the world, with content that is as erse as its readership. A scroll through the site reveals stories and news that feel very much like the charged WhatsApp threads taking place between women of a certain mindset – outspoken, socially conscious women who identify with prominent outspoken, socially conscious women such as Roxane Gay, Tracee Ellis Ross, Michaela Coel and Yara Shahidi. The articles on gal-dem have titles such as Are you a woke pixie dream girl?, Why Solange is my style icon, and The sex-deprived lives of young women who move back home. The tone strikes a balance that’s difficult to achieve between critical and cheery, knowing and earnest. And it resonates with women of all backgrounds. “I’ve received a lot of emails from white mothers saying that it’s been a really useful resource to help them understand their daughters. And I get a lot of young people asking me what to do to start a magazine,” she says.That leads us to the other extraordinary part of Little’s trajectory that she’s a media success story at a time when the industry is having an identity crisis. “It’s hard because the media is not always the nicest industry to be in and progress through. The environment can be hostile,” Little says, before thinking back to her time navigating jobs at television networks. “I’ve been in situations where I was the only person in the room who looked like me. You can find yourself tokenised.”But for the past year, she’s made gal-dem her full-time job – with the exception of freelance roles as contributing editor of Elle UK and a factual executive producer at the BBC – devoting all of her energy to turning her platform into a viable business. Does it sound like an empire in the making? For Little, it’s all to play for. “It’s now just a case of growing it further,” she says. And with that, a second producer comes in to greet her.

As part of our Tales of the everyday extraordinary series, we find out why no one embodies that more than influencer Chidera Eggerue. Images captured on the Google Pixel 3 by Stephanie Sian SmithAt first glance, the words “woke” and “fashion” don’t exactly seem to have much in common. But some time between the former’s emergence in progressive black circles in the US as a term to describe social, political and racial awareness in the early aughts and its co-opting by the internet mainstream as a slang catchall in the 2010s, it became the fashion in fashion. An extraordinary term that became everyday. In 2016, MTV actually added “woke” to its list of 10 words you should know.The proof is in the wave of catwalk political statements that started with designers such as Maria Grazia Chiuri at Dior and Prabal Gurung reviving the protest slogan tees made famous by Katherine Hamnett in the 1980s. This spirit of activism continues apace with model bookers taking a more considered, erse approach to casting that’s beyond tokenism: from the cornrowed Sudanese model Adut Akech walking the Valentino runway and Kenyan born Halima Aden in hijab at MaxMara, to trans model Jessica Espinosa walking for Louis Vuitton and the reappearance of older supers, such as Stella Tennant at Salvatore Ferragamo.Meanwhile, the influencer corners of Instagram went from aspirational street style, carefully filtered selfies and designer outfits to spaces leaning more towards activism, where a new class of equally well-dressed but notably less filtered women began opening up about their flaws with candour. These everyday women advocated for greater body positivity, equal pay and more meaningful ersity.Scroll through Instagram on any given day and you’ll see original fashion influencers such as Tamu McPherson declaring Black Lives Matter and Susie Bubble encouraging her followers to exercise their right to vote. Or model Adwoa Aboah revealing her struggles with addiction and mental health. Or actress Yara Shahidi demanding tighter gun control. But perhaps no one embodies the sea change from unheralded to everyday heroine more than Chidera Eggerue. Better known as The Slumflower, Eggerue is a Nigerian-born south Londoner who’s used her fashion blog to interrogate and dismantle rigid, age-old standards of beauty.It helps that Eggerue’s rise coincided with a general backlash against the false, Facetuned perfection that had been so pervasive on social media channels such as Instagram – and a shift towards iniduality and authenticity. “I do feel that I am a new breed of fashion influencer because I’m contributing to changing the way people view themselves, and I think how you view yourself influences the types of decisions that you make,” she says.Eggerue chose the name The Slumflower after a project by the same name that was created by menswear collective Street Etiquette about a rose growing from concrete – or, in Eggerue’s case, a young girl growing up in Peckham. “Beautifully growing, glowing and flourishing in an environment that appears to promote the opposite,” she says.Eggerue recalls reading fashion magazines as a child and being struck by the homogenous depiction of glamour on the pages. “The imagery perpetuated a narrow definition of beauty, which is why I had to create #saggyboobsmatter,” she says of the hashtag she launched last year that grew to become a movement.“It impacted me because it made me feel like I was never going to be good enough and that I had to be a particular type of woman in order to receive the type of love that is glorified – you know, men professing their love with grand gestures for these beautiful women who look so ine and perfect,” she says. “I always felt like I’m not ine or perfect, so that means I’m not going to get the love I want. And if I do want that love, I’ll need to look different.”Her breasts became a lightening rod. “They were the main issue because when I’d go out to get bra fittings done, the models on the packaging never looked like me. Their boobs didn’t look like what my boobs looked like. So, even when I’d get the bra that was being pushed in my face, I still wouldn’t have the desired result, so it created a complex in my mind,” she says.Eventually, she realised the only way to conquer it was to own the very qualities she initially viewed as flaws. “It forced me in the direction of having to be content with my own beauty, because if I didn’t do that I would be living and walking in a shadow of myself. I wouldn’t have known joy or what it’s like to feel confident in myself. I wouldn’t have known that the world is definitely not going to come to an end,” she says. “In fact, the world will come to an end if you refuse to accept yourself, because all you’ll know is a version of yourself that other people have told you to be and why do those people have authority over who you are?”The message behind the #saggyboobsmatter movement resonated on social media, generating more than 8,000 Instagram posts from women around the world sharing their own everyday body narratives in response to Eggerue’s extraordinary honesty. The pace with which the hashtag spread was proof that social media’s cult of perfection had lost its lustre.When Victoria’s Secret received criticism for a fashion show that relied on tired, reductive and restrictive notions of female sexuality, it was Eggerue’s hashtag that journalists referenced as an example of how times have changed. Women no longer aspire to Barbie doll proportions and Kardashian-esque curves.Eggerue’s profile has grown alongside a community of like-minded, equally prominent women on social media such as the trans model and activist Munroe Bergdorf @munroebergdorf and influencer Megan Jayne Crabbe @bodyposipanda, an attractive woman of size known for posting videos in which she joyfully twerks, shakes and rolls her ample love handles, hips and thighs.“I’m never going to stop talking about Munroe because she shows up so boldly,” she says. “She’s tenacious, courageous and paves the way for other women and I just think her presence is so important in modern society. I can’t imagine where I would be without knowing she existed. And Megan opened up a massive conversation about beauty ideals and fashion accessibility. She has about a million followers and she basically became popular for making videos where she would jiggle her body to music in her underwear and as a plus-size woman that’s something you rarely ever see. I learn so much from watching her Instagram stories alone.”Most likely, others feel the same way about Eggerue. The BBC recently included her on its annual 100 Women list, honouring trailblazers in their field. “I remember when I was laughed at for creating #saggyboobsmatter,” she wrote in an Instagram post announcing the news. “Now, I’m being referred to as a leader among legends!” A new breed of woke fashion influencer?

As part of our Tales of the everyday extraordinary series, we meet a new breed of activists, such as ex-gang member Karl Lokko, who demonstrate just how important this is. Images captured on the Google Pixel 3When Karl Lokko was 12 years old, his life took its first swerve towards danger. He saw someone shot for the first time, on Brixton’s Myatts Field estate, the south London housing block he called home. For years, the estate had earned a reputation as a place where families and children lived in the crossfire of local conflicts. And for a time, it seemed as though Lokko would commit his life to the gang culture that seemed to thrive in his area. Now, though, he considers that estate one of the most meaningful places in his life.“It had a terrible reputation – branded at one point by the press as the ‘Devil’s Den’,” he says. Even then, it was still the backdrop for the childhood games he remembers playing with friends: “Knock down ginger, 4040 home, run outs and park-swing Olympics.” It’s also where Lokko met Pastor Mimi Asher as a young adult – the woman who would eventually turn his life around.And that’s where Lokko’s story leaps from the everyday into the extraordinary. He didn’t follow a route carved out for him, leading away from school and into life on the streets. Instead, the 28-year-old found himself – and a new focus – as close to home as the gangland distractions. He’s grown into one of several inspiring Londoners who’ve used their combination of experience and personal knowledge to turn well-known spaces and activities into life-changing sites of positive change.In Lokko’s case, that came down to how Asher refocused his energy, leading him to a very different life. As in giving TEDx Talks, striking up a friendship with Prince Harry and working as a charity ambassador. By grabbing his life by the lapels and steering it in a new direction, the poet, activist and influencer has matured into someone who’s able to see the mundane in a new light. Lokko credits Pastor Asher for nudging him away from criminality. She would open her flat on the estate to him and other vulnerable young men. And inside, she ran a Christian faith group, which she described to the  as being less about God and scripture and more “about helping to give young men identity, value and something to believe in”.Other innovators similarly use their surroundings as a springboard for community work and making a positive impact. Fellow poet Momtaza Mehri takes inspiration from her London upbringing and Somali heritage to write forceful works that vibrate with the capital’s energy. As this year’s young people’s laureate for London, she tackles everything from gentrification to race, street violence and the living, breathing history of her city. Mehri says her writing is invested in “questions or ideas around disruption or movement, whether it’s movement of people or places, movement between different ideas, between how things change over different generations, and in themes of migration and urban spaces”.Elsewhere in the city, Tanya Compas and Charlie Dark work in separate disciplines but both help their communities see themselves in newly affirming ways. Compas is a youth worker, who – through workshops, events and education – empowers young women of colour to see their worth. She’s won several awards, and is one of the Evening Standard’s 1,000 most influential Londoners. Dark founded Run Dem Crew, a running group that began to help inspire young men of colour that has now turned into a city-wide phenomenon in London.Finally, groups such as Muslim Girls Fence – using the sport of fencing to break down stereotypes about Muslim women – and the Big House, bringing isolated care leavers into theatre production, show what can happen when collectives help amplify marginalised voices. As Sarah Saaed, a teenage Muslim Girls Fence mentor put it, the programme “gives me power. It makes me feel like I have strength and I am powerful, and I’m strong and resilient.” Both programmes excel at allowing their participants to see themselves anew.As for Lokko, he’s developed his poetry and songwriting around the city since Asher demonstrated how Myatts Field estate and the wider community could provide inspiration rather than stir up fear. Take the underground, for example: specifically, the Victoria line’s southernmost stop. “As a Brixton boy, any commute across the city started from this point. But what became apparent to me after a while is that poetry was always a by-product on these trips,” says Lokko.And so he wrote the majority of his first poetry collection, The Butterfly Effect, zooming along in tube carriages, he says. “The underground was where people made contact but rarely connected. The British reserve gave way for silence on crowded carriages that would usher, for me, creativity.” Anyone’s surroundings can turn into sites for new potential – you just have to be willing to see your world with fresh eyes.Find out more about the Google Pixel 3 here "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a13c28d2dcf1c4cb7d7f2add8f6c5e719be3819/95_0_2082_1250/master/2082.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cf6c7e6fb867f43e50324f9a0cca7e89","title":"five developments space time fusion physics astronomy","story":"Cern has announced plans for a Future Circular Collider.

Now Adam Price, the man behind the hit drama Borgen, hopes to get audiences similarly enthralled by God, faith and the Danish Lutheran church.Price has solid form in taking seemingly dense themes and making them not merely palatable but positively ambrosial. By the time Borgen finished its third and final series on BBC Four, it was regularly pulling in more than a million viewers, having convinced many along the way that they were experts in the politics of coalition government in Denmark.Channel 4’s streaming service Walter Presents clearly believes that Price’s new series, Ride Upon the Storm, will have a similar effect: the foreign-language platform was quick to snap up rights to the series, which recently won an International Emmy award for star Lars Mikkelsen. The drama will air on Channel 4 on Sundays at 11pm, the late time a testament to the knotty subject matter.“It is a slightly darker and more difficult story than Borgen, which was both very idealistic and lighter in tone,” says Price, adding that he sees the series as being at heart about the “fall of a patriarch”. “Borgen was very much a feminist project looking at how it might feel to be a woman in power, while losing influence within your family, whereas this is about modern masculinity and the weight of expectations. It’s a story about how terribly easy it is to destroy your kids and what that might mean.”The show depicts the relationship between charismatic Lutheran minister Johannes (Mikkelsen) and his two sons, one a quiet but successful people-pleaser, the other seemingly intent on self-destruction. “It’s a bit about religion, a bit about the politics of the church and a lot about a dysfunctional family,” says Price.Price was also interested in the more political elements of the modern Danish church. “The initial spark came because I was driving back home one evening and I heard a report about the election for a new bishop, and thought how perfectly weird it was that you could have this political atmosphere in a space that should be about faith. It made me wonder if you could do a series which took that political environment in Borgen and moved it towards religion.”It helped, he explains, that the Lutheran church occupies a distinct position in Danish society. “Priests are still very important figures, especially outside of the bigger cities, and there is also a long tradition of them being prolific in Denmark’s cultural life. They are often writers and lecturers and very well known, so I thought it would be interesting to look at a man like that, a well-known and respected figure, and consider what would happen to him if things started to fall apart.”The complexity of the subject matter meant that the show took a number of years to come together. “It’s definitely been the most challenging project I’ve ever worked on because there are huge existential ideas, such as what faith is and what it might mean, but the challenge is how to put those into a drama. The answer is by making a character-driven series. This is a story about families and also about dynasty – because one of the interesting things is that we do have families in Denmark where tradition and obligation means that son has followed father into priesthood. I thought that was quite interesting, particularly because I come from an old family of artists – we have been working in the same fields in my family for 300 years, so I knew what it felt like to be part of a long heritage and to have that obligation to succeed, and I wanted to look at what that might mean.”Not that writing is Price’s only outlet. In Denmark, he Price is known both as an award-winning writer and producer and a TV chef: his show with his brother James, Spise med Price (Cooking with the Prices) is in its 11th season. “It’s really a sideline to my main career and a way of having fun with my brother,” he says with a laugh. “We came up with the idea after watching the BBC Food channel and realising that Danish TV had pushed food programmes on to daytime TV. We’re both good amateur chefs but I think the real reason it does well is because it’s about two brothers hanging out and teasing each other. There’s something very appealing about that.”Ride Upon the Storm will air on Channel 4 on Sundays at 11pm from 27 January"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/492f57983d0f1cdb61c2dd1eb183e3dcb7ad565d/0_291_4387_2631/master/4387.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7ec69c60f2ae5f24eca0b9b8b0e83a5d","title":"sundays best tv vera les miserables sas who dares wins","story":"There’s topicality and tragedy in the north-eastern detective series and Valjean plans a new adventure in Andrew Davies’s drama adaptationThe bluff north-eastern detective drama may be guilty of occasional shortcomings, but a lack of topicality is certainly not an accusation that holds water this week.

She lives 2,500 miles from the US border with Mexico, where Donald Trump has demanded funds for a wall in exchange for ending the partial government shutdown.Nonetheless, the shutdown has hit Libby, 26, with devastating force. A mother of two daughters aged four and six, she was on the verge of buying her first home in southern Maine when the shutdown happened.A $200,000 mortgage Libby had negotiated with the support of the US department of agriculture was supposed to close on Friday. But with the shutdown, the loan program has ground to a halt. Meanwhile her landlord has found a new tenant, and Libby, a payroll specialist at a healthcare organization, fears becoming homeless.“My loan officer is pretty confident that at this point, closing in January is not an option at all, and we need to be out of our home at the end of the month,” Libby said. “So my option is packing up all of my stuff, finding a storage unit and sleeping on my mom’s living room floor until I can get into my home.“It’s going to be difficult, especially for my kids.”As the longest shutdown in US history enters its fifth week, the waves of havoc it has created are crashing ever further outward, threatening essential government functions and introducing unexpected hardships in the lives of millions of Americans.Crucial climate change monitoring and research has halted. Unpaid Coast Guard enlistees have had to turn to food banks to feed their families. Asylum seekers who have already waited years for an immigration court hearing now have to wait years longer. Theater workers and stage actors are threatened by an interruption in arts funding. Corrections officers can’t buy gas to get to work. Inmates say basic services are falling apart. Some federal employees have had to tap into their retirement plans.For those employees required to work without a paycheck because their roles are deemed essential, the pressure is intense, said Clifton Buchanan, a bureau of prisons corrections officer and union executive from Houston, Texas.“Last night I got a disturbing call that one of my officers attempted suicide,” Buchanan said. “Not having gas, not having food – I have staff that are contemplating quitting to go find another job. We’re already short-staffed.“It’s not a joke that we’re working for free.”Inside Washington, the shutdown has in part played out as a political circus: Trump serving 300 hamburgers on silver platters to a visiting college football team members of Congress stuck on a tour bus after Trump, at the last minute, canceled their overseas trip the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, telling Trump to delay his planned State of the Union Address angry letters sent back and forth between the White House and Capitol Hill.But each day, terrible new costs of the political deadlock emerge. Federal employees claiming unemployment benefits jumped to 10,000 in the first week of the year, according to labor department figures – double the number from the previous week.According to a Syracuse University data tracking program, the shutdown has derailed more than 60,000 immigration cases and counting, said federal judge Amiena Khan, speaking in her capacity as executive vice-president of the National Association of Immigration Judges union. Because immigration courts are already over-scheduled, delayed cases probably get bumped to the “end of the line” – which probably means the end of 2021, almost three years away.“These are human beings that we deal with in immigration court on a daily basis,” Khan said. “These are life-and-death decisions for many iniduals.”Ironically, given that Trump’s desire to eject and ban immigrants is driving the shutdown, some immigrants whose claims of asylum are without merit have been in effect granted a years-long reprieve by the shutdown.“It shows a high level of dysfunction,” Khan said.The shutdown has threatened to weaken the country’s immigration system in other ways. Border officers are among those working without pay, as are enlistees in the US Coast Guard, an essential part of immigration enforcement that last year recorded an almost fivefold increase in the number of migrants it intercepted off the coast of southern California.Yet some Coast Guard families have faced food emergencies and other crises because of the shutdown, said Katie Walvatne, 34, president of the south-east Connecticut Coast Guard Spouses Association.Walvatne, whose husband has served in the Coast Guard for more than 15 years, recently helped to open a food bank for enlisted families and other federal workers at the US Coast Guard academy in New London, Connecticut.“We just realized that families are going to need something so that they can put groceries in their pantries,” Walvatne said.“I have been there each day, and there’s always a steady stream of people coming in. And it’s everybody. It’s not just active duty.”Walvatne said the community’s sense of solidarity had ameliorated some of the difficulty of the situation.“For as much anxiety and stress as we’re having right now with this whole shutdown, the community – both active duty and not – has just been amazing,” she said.Elsewhere, the shutdown has interrupted basic government functions, such as processing tax returns, providing food assistance and supporting low-income housing. Arts organizations dependent on grants from the National Endowment for the Arts aren’t receiving promised funds for 2019 – and any grant submissions for 2020 cannot be processed, according to the Actors’ Equity Association union.The shutdown also has severely impeded scientists’ ability to monitor and research climate change data, said Paul Shearon, president of the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers union, whose members work at the Environmental Protection Agency, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Nasa and elsewhere.“Even all the way down to weather satellites, a lot of that information is just not being – is not available because those people are out,” Shearon said. Some important field work, such as identifying toxins and conducting cleanup in the wake of last November’s fatal wildfires in California, has been suspended or slowed – or employees are conducting the dangerous job without pay.“People are starting to go into their 401(k) plans to pay for rent, to pay regular bills.” Shearon said. “There are huge penalties that are involved in touching that 401(k) plan – that’s pretty dramatic.”Back in southern Maine, Briana Libby reflected on how close she had come to securing a piece of the American dream, which she hopes might still be hers.“It’s supposed to be a happy, exciting thing – but we are in fear of being homeless,” she said.Asked whether the experience had affected her political views, Libby said, “I don’t really pay too much attention to politics, to be honest. I never was a Trump supporter, but I also don’t really put my nose into it too much because, I just don’t.“But I think he’s making a fool of our country by doing this.

Actress and activist Alyssa Milano tweeted that the footage “brought me to tears”, while actor Chris Evans tweeted that the students’ actions were “appalling” and “shameful”.In a joint statement, the high school and Diocese of Covington condemned the actions of the students “towards Nathan Phillips specifically, and Native Americans in general”.“We extend our deepest apologies to Mr. Phillips,” the statement read. “This behavior is opposed to the Church’s teachings on the dignity and respect of the human person.”“The matter is being investigated and we will take appropriate action, up to an including expulsion.”Covington Mayor Joe Meyer, a Democrat, said the “appalling” footage had rightly inspired “a tidal wave of condemnation” and that his town was now being linked with “intolerance and ethnic intimidation” because of the boys’ actions.“The videos being shared across the nation do NOT represent the core beliefs and values of this city,” he said in a statement.In a separate video uploaded to social media, the 64-year-old Phillips, an elder of Nebraska’s Omaha tribe, wiped away tears as he described the incident.“I heard them saying ‘build that wall, build that wall’. These are indigenous lands, we’re not supposed to have walls,” he said. “I wish I could see that energy of that young mass of young men, put that energy into making this country, really, really great, helping those that are hungry.”He told The Washington Post that while he was drumming, he thought about his wife, Shoshana, who died of bone marrow cancer nearly four years ago, and the threats that indigenous communities around the world are facing.“I felt like the spirit was talking through me,” Phillips said.Phillips holds an annual ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery to honor Native American veterans, according to media reports.He is a well-known Native American activist who was among those leading the Standing Rock protests in 2016-2017 against the construction of an oil pipeline in North Dakota.Democratic US Congresswoman Deb Haaland, a member of New Mexico’s Laguna Pueblo tribe, said on Twitter that Phillips had risked his life for his country, and that the students showed “blatant hate, disrespect, and intolerance”.Reuters and Associated Press contributed to this report"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7c37ad225c6539d68f8f1c6d2b69a26018426f4f/0_171_4534_2721/master/4534.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eef3dc7430714293fbebd5d687b511e6","title":"south africa weird sinister apartheid mercenary saimr keith maxwell","story":"Keith Maxwell, the self-declared “commodore” of the South African Institute for Maritime Research (SAIMR), liked to dress up on special occasions in the garish costume of a 18th-century admiral, with a three-cornered hat, brass buttons and a cutlass. Ordinary members of his organisation were expected to show up in crisp naval whites.Gathered together in upmarket restaurants, or the quiet of the Wemmer Pan naval base in south-central Johannesburg, they had the air of eccentric history buffs. Maxwell talked about the group’s roots in a Napoleonic-era treasure-hunting syndicate, and told outsiders it was still focused on deep-sea exploration.But appearances were deceptive. Beneath the bizarre trappings lurked a powerful mercenary outfit that members claim was entwined with the apartheid state and offered soldiers for hire across the continent.“It was clandestine operations. We were involved in coups, taking over countries for other leaders,” said Alexander Jones, who has detailed his years as an intelligence officer with the group. SAIMR’s leaders described themselves as “anti-communist” to him at the time but the group was underpinned by racism, he said. “We were trying to retain the white supremacy on the African continent.”And among its leaders’ most dramatic claims was that it was behind the mysterious 1961 plane crash that killed UN secretary general Dag Hammarskjöld and 15 other people.Last week the Observer revealed evidence linking an RAF veteran, Jan van Risseghem, to the tragedy. Now new documents and eyewitness accounts shed light on the alleged role of SAIMR, which claimed responsibility for the crash in secret papers and its own recruitment drives.It is not clear if Van Risseghem, who told a friend he had shot down Hammarskjöld’s plane without knowing who was on board, had any ties to the group. Any command could have come through an intermediary.But Jones was clear that SAIMR liked to claim ultimate responsibility for killing the UN chief. Photos of the crash site and wreckage, with purported members of the group standing nearby, featured in a presentation made to potential members when he joined three decades ago, he said.“They didn’t tell us at that point in time that it was Hammarskjöld they just said that they had taken out a very high-profile political opponent,” Jones told filmmakers investigating the crash.Maxwell himself apparently also claimed SAIMR had brought down the plane, in a handwritten memoir about the group that ended up with the family of an SAIMR veteran.Hammarskjöld’s death came amid a post-colonial race for resources in Africa. A champion of decolonisation, he made powerful enemies with his support for newly independent states and opposition to white minority rule.On his final flight, he was heading for a secret meeting to try to broker peace in recently independent Congo. The country was on the brink of collapse after its Katanga province – key to national wealth because it held most of the country’s rich mineral deposits – declared independence. Western mining interests backed the rebels.Jones claims he answered a SAIMR advertisement in a South African newspaper three decades ago and served for several years. He decided to speak out because he felt he needed closure and because young South Africans should know the truth.“Anybody that resisted any white form of manipulation on the African continent, SAIMR was prepared to go and quell those for a price,” Jones said. “And that is one thing that Dag Hammarskjöld was totally against. He wanted every country for the people of that country. He was killed because he was going to change the way that Africa dealt with the rest of the world financially, and he was a threat.”Jones was tracked down by the makers of a new documentary, Cold Case Hammarskjöld, who were looking into SAIMR because of documents handed to South Africa’s truth and reconciliation commission by the country’s National Intelligence Agency two decades ago.Unveiled at a press conference by the commission chair, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, they purported to detail how SAIMR had masterminded the crash in coordination with UK and US intelligence services. Investigators were never able to examine the papers, though, because soon after they were returned to the archives, and the South African authorities have been unable or unwilling to retrieve the originals. The United Nations, which has reopened its investigation into Hammarskjöld’s death, has criticised South Africa for its lack of cooperation in finding the file.Investigators have been working from poor quality photocopies of just eight documents, and for years there were questions about whether SAIMR even existed. In the UK, the Foreign Office suggested the papers were hoaxes planted by Soviet agents in a disinformation campaign, and added that British spies “do not go around bumping people off”.But South Africa was a known recruiting ground for mercenaries who fought in coups and conflicts across much of Africa over the second half of the last century, from Congo and Sierra Leone to Angola and Mozambique.And over the years growing evidence of SAIMR as a real, and dangerous, entity has emerged.Investigative journalist De Wet Potgieter interviewed Maxwell for an article in the 1990s. He took the only known picture of the “commodore”, and also collected a cache of papers from Maxwell.Those papers included a section of his autobiography and purported lists of recruits for several operations, which the filmmakers used to track down former members. They called dozens, but only two agreed to talk.Clive Jansen van Vuuren said he spent two or three months training with the group, which he thought had ties to the security forces. “I know it’s linked to the intelligence bureau of South Africa, but we were never given specifics,” he said.He had kept a certificate that names him as a petty officer and carries the same slightly bizarre emblem as all other SAIMR papers – the figurehead of the British ship the Cutty Sark. But he said he never went on operations.Jones claims to have had a more senior role, over a much longer period, and describes the group as a powerful militia. “SAIMR was not a Mickey Mouse organisation. We were not just a group of guys that got together in the weekend and decided to go do some military exercises and stuff. That was a living, breathing body,” he said.He was recruited as an intelligence officer, after serving in a similar position with the South African armed forces, and participated in several operations. “I was definitely in the frontline: operational frontline, hand-to-hand frontline, fighting frontline. Leading operations, if you want to call it that.” Asked by filmmakers if he had killed people himself, he said “yes”.Jones says he left SAIMR shortly before the advent of majority rule, and destroyed all evidence of his membership.Maxwell commanded SAIMR the whole time Jones served. A strange character, charismatic and idiosyncratic, he wore naval whites at all times unless he was in his admiral’s uniform, van Vuuren, Jones and Potgieter remember. But he was also extremely dangerous. “If he didn’t like you, and if you posed a threat, he would take you out,” Jones said.The penchant for dressing up was confirmed by a doctor, Claude Newbury, who met him through anti-abortion advocacy. He told the filmmakers Maxwell invited him to join SAIMR, describing it as a group focused mostly on hunting for lost treasure. At a private dinner, they had something “a little bit like a ceremony – he had dressed up like an admiral in the British navy from 250 years ago, with a tricorn hat, and a cutlass, and a naval uniform with lots of buttons.”He also confirmed that Maxwell was involved in violence in South Africa, forcing a doctor who was performing abortions to leave the country.“He went down and visited this Dutch abortionist and said to him, you are not welcome here, and killing of babies is an unacceptable pastime, and for the sake of your health I advise you go back to the Netherlands. Which apparently the chap did.”South Africa’s former head of military intelligence, Tienie Groenewald, appears in some of Maxwell’s papers. In an interview recorded before his death in 2015, he claimed he had never heard of SAIMR but remembered meeting the “commodore”.He described Maxwell as an intelligence operative with suspected links to foreign spies, who wanted to meet him in the dying days of apartheid to discuss an armed uprising to block the advent of democratic rule. Maxwell offered both men and arms, claiming “he had resources, to use violence, and to supply weapons, and so on and so forth”.Although Groenewald said he declined the offer, he described Maxwell as the credible leader of a mercenary group. “He appeared to be someone who was in authority … He obviously had a background in intelligence,” he told the filmmakers. “I couldn’t prove it but I was convinced that he was financed and directed by MI6.”Groenewald, who had served as air attache at the South African embassy in London, added: “After spending three and a half years in Britain, you get to know some people involved in the intelligence field. And certain of the names which are mentioned in our discussions were familiar to him.”Maxwell died in 2006, but a lurid account of his life and SAIMR ended up with relatives of an ex-recruit, who shared them with the filmmakers. The handwriting matches other documents written by Maxwell and its authenticity has been attested to by Jones. Maxwell had already handed a few dozen pages of a memoir to Potgieter around 1990, and they were repeated in the new cache, but it also included over 100 pages of new material.Some sections on SAIMR included episodes that he may not have personally witnessed – by his own account he did not join the group until 1964 – and there are some names and details are altered. Still, the episodes are described vividly, from the perspective of an eyewitness.And one details the alleged plot to bring down Hammarskjöld – an account which matches the plan laid out in the papers revealed by Tutu. “This operation has to be arranged as an accident or a heart attack,” the commodore of the time tells his team. “Without any pathologist throwing a ner in the works and making Dag and his colleagues into martyrs.” He asks for three workable plans to take out the UN chief.Maxwell does not say what these were, but details a technician loading a bomb into the wheel well of Hammarskjöld’s plane in the Congolese capital Léopoldville (now Kinshasa) with a beating heart, and his frustration at watching it take off without the bomb exploding.The memoir switches back to SAIMR’s planners, sitting round a table later that evening, disappointed by the failure of the bomb. But according to the truth and reconciliation commission’s papers, SAIMR then dispatched an “eagle” to target Hammarskjöld.In Maxwell’s account, just as the commodore tells them to get some rest, there is a knock at the door. “A lieutenant entered, saluted and handed a slip of paper to the commodore. ‘What’s this? Oh my God, it worked’.”Göran Björkdahl and Calla Wahlquist contributed reporting"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3869e59a7a1f66d6c4c3296ddc67369dd823c7b9/0_127_4091_2456/master/4091.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=447dd81b56724318fe0438c36bed87e1","title":"womens march 2019 in pictures","story":"Thousands gathered across the globe to call for equality and the protection of women’s rights"},{"url":null,"title":"college","story":"The first significant career choice you make will not necessarily be life-determiningRegister your details now \u0026ndash you can determine your final course preferences laterMany students receive financial help but preparation is key when it comes to securing the correct level of fundingAvoid the traps: Parents can offer vital support, but their knowledge is often outdatedWhat factors should you consider when deciding on what career path you wish to takeMultinational firms concerned over standard of foreign languages among school-leaversWe talk to graduates who made the wrong call when they filled out the CAO formTimeline for the 2019 college application processThousands to apply for courses ahead of this month\u0026rsquos application deadlineDownload PDFs of our comprehensive list of level 8 and level 67 courses"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2017/10/12/TELEMMGLPICT000140439032_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"parliament accused conflict interest rejects nda debate","story":"John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, refused to allow Maria Miller to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerfulHouse of CommonsMaria Miller, the Tory MP, last night accused Parliament of a conflict of interest over Britain\u0027s MeToo scandal after it emerged she had been blocked from questioning the Government over it.The Daily  can reveal John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, yesterday refused to allow Ms Miller, who chairs the women \u0026amp equalities Commons select committee, to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerful, including the Topshop tycoon Sir Philip Green.Helen Jones, chairman of the petitions select committee, also rejected calls to allow a parliamentary debate on non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) after two separate petitions demanding a change to the law between them secured 250,000 signatures. It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward. I can\u0027t imagine celebrities would want to be associated with Philip Green. He\u0027s in a tricky situation.

I don’t think you can ever look at a person and know what their voice is going to be. If somebody touches your soul, that’s the important thing, not that they look amazing and fit into a size zero couture dress.”In 2014, the size issue came to the fore when Irish mezzo Tara Erraught was deemed by critics to be too fat for her role in Der Rosenkavalier at Glyndebourne.Singers leapt to the defence of Tara ErraughtIt is also hoped that the competition will reach young people from disadvantaged backgrounds.Judges for the first audition stage will not have access to the contestants’ CVs.Lodge explained: “In my job I’ve read thousands of CVs and I realised how easy it is to form your opinion of somebody before you’ve heard them - the conservatoire where they studied, if they’ve worked for such-and-such company. “There can be 400 people going for one chorus job, so directors have to filter somehow and of course it’s natural to filter by CV.“The established route is via a recognised conservatoire or cathedral school, but in order to get to those you have to have access to information about them in the first place. I want to show that if you are from a disadvantaged background but you are given access, then there are no limits.”The prize fund is £5,000, with two awards of £500 each to be made in the first round recognising singers who have potential and would benefit from further training.Lodge said: “The most interesting thing is not who wins the prize at the end, it’s discovering the raw talent in the first stage and helping those people get more support and tuition to find their way into the profession.”Please review our commenting policy\u0026#39We owe China, what can we do?\u0026#39 Why Muslim countries stay silent over China\u0026#39s mass detention of UighursBangladesh accused of using war on drugs to hide political assassinationsContraceptive pill can be taken every day of the month, after scientists dismiss \u0026#39Pope rule\u0026#39Comment: The British state is a shambles.

This equates to £875 more revenue, per every 500 parishioners.SumUp told The  that the churches using the technology saw their donations double within four months of using the digital collection plate.The total digital revenue taken on the new collections plates has skyrocketed since September and the contactless card readers now account for nearly half of digital donations, such as standing orders, that churches are receiving altogether.“Overall giving has increased. It appears that people who were previously not giving, maybe because they didn\u0027t have cash on them, are now giving when they have the opportunity,” Reverend Margaret Cave of Christ Church East Greenwich told The .“It appears the usual cash collections have not gone down but that we are having additional donations made through the digital collection box.”Vicar Dan Leathers of St Mark’s Haydock in St Helen’s has also been using contactless during church services. He said: “The contactless option allows those who don’t carry cash to contribute to this work of the church if they feel so inspired.”Some church collection plates began to go contactless in June 2017 when the Church of England decided to target one off events like christenings and weddings to increase its revenue.It made portable card readers available to more than 16,000 churches, cathedrals and religious sites meaning that congregations and visitors could make a donation using their bank cards or phones, with Apple Pay and Google Pay compatible with the service.The current roll out sees a digital collection plate passed around the congregation during regular Sunday service, either alongside, or completely replacing, the typical offertory.It comes as SumUp found a 540 percent increase in digital charity donations last year, compared to in 2017, a method embraced by the Mayor of London who introduced contactless giving points across the city last year to generate more donations to the homeless.Contactless use in general has soared in the past three years, overcoming any concerns about the security of pin-free transactions.In 2017, £25bn was spent using contactless which was more than twice the £11bn spent in the previous eight years combined.  The revolution has also swept up pensioners - a new report published by UK Finance last Summer showed that for the first time, more than half of over-65s were using contactless cards, compared to two-thirds of UK consumers at large.Reverend Cave added that although new technology in the church often appeals to millenials, older members of her congregation are embracing it too.She said: “We have a really wide age range and the oldest member of our congregation is 93. He is amazing and he has certainly used the card reader at some point.”Church of EnglandPlease review our commenting policy\u0026#39We owe China, what can we do?\u0026#39 Why Muslim countries stay silent over China\u0026#39s mass detention of UighursBangladesh accused of using war on drugs to hide political assassinationsContraceptive pill can be taken every day of the month, after scientists dismiss \u0026#39Pope rule\u0026#39Comment: The British state is a shambles.

I\u0027ve heard of people getting early screenings before. How do I get in on this action? I\u0027m not a child, or anyone with a particularly tragic story. Just a normal guy. I\u0027m 33, lost my sister three years ago to the same rare genetic disease it turns out I have too. I\u0027ll leave behind a devoted girlfriend and an adopted greyhound. I thought I\u0027d make it to April at least, but my bone marrow is toast.”His fellow Reddit users shared the story, and it eventually paid off as Alexander revealed that Disney had contacted him. He says they\u0027re now discussing plans for him to watch the film, titled Avengers:\u0026nbspEndgame, months before it\u0027s released in cinemas.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialIn response, he said: “I cried when I read their email. It\u0027s everything I hoped for and I owe it to all of you,” adding that he knows “a guy who knows a guy who is chums” with Hemsworth.“I think they called him tonight on my behalf,” he said.Created with Sketch.The most shocking film twists of all time Show all 37Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The set-up: The services of linguistics professor Louise Banks (Amy Adams) are called upon when aliens arrive on Earth. While experiencing visions of her daughter, who we learn died from cancer in her teens, Louise attempts to communicate with the race in a bid to discern the purpose of their visit.The twist: Louise deciphers the language, which gives her the ability to see into the future. What we thought were flashbacks are, in fact, flash-forwards – her daughter is yet to be born.The set-up: Briony Tallis (Saoirse Ronan) falsely accuses the housekeeper’s son (James McAvoy) of raping her cousin when she becomes jealous of his relationship with her older sister (Keira Knightley). He’s sent to prison, but is eventually freed to enlist in World War II – and the audience is told that he eventually rekindled his romance with Cecilia and lived happily ever after.The twist: Only, they didn’t. We learn that this is another lie from an older Briony – both Robbie and Cecilia died in the war.The set-up: Having been hired by Evelyn Mulwray (Faye Dunaway) to investigate her husband’s death, JJ Gittes (Jack Nicholson) discovers the existence of someone crucial to the case: Evelyn’s sister, Katherine. The twist: After being confronted by Gittes, Evelyn reveals that Katherine is also her daughter – and the result of being raped by her father when she was 15.The set-up: IRA member Fergus (Stephen Rea) promises to protect Dil (Jaye Davidson), the girlfriend of a soldier his group has imprisoned, and soon begins an unexpected relationship with her. The twist: Dil is transgender, and was born male. Fergus\u0027s love for her sees him take the fall for a shooting she commits.The set-up: Having awoken in a bathtub, and discovering he has telekinetic abilities, John Murdoch attempts to find the truth behind a dystopian world that’s inhabited by an evil group who can stop time and implant memories.The twist: His search for meaning sees him reach the end of the city. With nowhere left to go, he breaks through a wall and finds the city is actually an island floating through outer space.The set-up: Cop Frank Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) infiltrates the organisation of gang chief Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) at the same time that criminal Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) infiltrates the police force – and both soon suspect they have spies in their midst.The twist: Both end up dead. A shocking sequence sees Sullivan kill Costigan who believes he\u0027s got away with it. Sergeant Sean Dignam (Mark Wahlberg) sees to that in an equally as shocking climactic scene.The set-up: A woman named Christina is enlisted into murdering her husband by his mistress. However, once the deed is done, his body disappears.The twist: Her husband faked his death with the help of his mistress. The pair wanted to make Christina believe she committed the murder in an attempt to destroy her.The set-up: Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) is trained by Obi Wan Kenobi and Jedi master Yoda to defeat the evil Darth Vader, leading to the showdown of all showdowns.The twist: Skywalker’s delivered a blow after making a pretty huge discovery: the villain is his father. Cue shock and awe.The set-up: The world of the film’s insomniac narrator (Edward Norton) collides with that of Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) as they start an underground club that permits ordinary people to have fistfights with one another.The twist: The narrator and Tyler are dissociated personalties – AKA they are the same person.The set-up: Nicholas Van Orton (Michael Douglas) flees after agreeing to participate in a twisted game that sees him – among other things – buried alive and contemplating suicide after accidentally murdering his brother. The twist: It really was just a game the entire time, set up by his brother who wasn\u0027t killed at all.The set-up: Rose (Allison Williams), a white woman, brings her black boyfriend Chris (Daniel Kaluuya) home to meet her family. Chris soon becomes convinced they bury a dark secret and attempts to convince his girlfriend they should leave. The twist: He’s not wrong – only Rose is in on the conspiracy. After uncovering photos of black men she’s had prior relationships with, Chris is abducted, realising that he’s been lured to her cult-like family who want to implant their loved ones’s brains into the body of younger black bodies.  The set-up: When Amy Dunne (Rosamund Pike) goes missing, her husband Nick (Ben Affleck) becomes the prime suspect behind her disappearance.The twist: Mid-way through the film, all becomes clear – Amy faked her abduction and spent months framing her husband in revenge for his extra-marital digressions.The set-up: Brothers Elias and Lukas (played by real-life siblings Elias and Lukas Schwarz) believe their mother to be an imposter after she returns home having had her face reconstructed due to a car crash. They take (rather disturbing) matters into their own hands. The twist: One of the twins actually died in the crash. The other, unable to accept his brother\u0027s death, has merely imagined him to be alive the whole time and exacts revenge, blaming their mother for his death.The set-up: As a convict awaits execution for several murders, 10 strangers find themselves stranded in a rainstorm at a remote Nevada hotel. Soon, they start getting killed off one by one.The twist: The strangers comprise the split personalities of the convict. The motel is a fabricated reality via which doctors are attempting to find out which one is causing his murderous tendencies. They zone in on limo driver Ed (John Cusack) without realising they\u0027ve selected the wrong one: the murderous personality is a nine-year-old kid named Timmy.The set-up: Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) must track down and stop a terrorist known as the Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) who has launched a series of attacks on the world.The twist: He succeeds – but learns that the Mandarin is actually a British actor called Trevor Slattery who has been hired by the actual people responsible.  The set-up: Two contract killers are given a list of people to dispatch of. Their journey leads them to a cult ceremony where one of the men, Jay (Neil Maskell), must kill one final victim known as The Hunchback.The twist: The Hunchback is actually his imprisoned wife with their son strapped to her back. After he kills them, he is crowned by the cultists.The set-up: Leonard (Guy Pearce) is tracking down the man who raped and murdered his wife. However, his search is stunted by his short-term memory loss. Throughout the film, he tells the story of Sammy Jankis, a man who accidentally killed his diabetic wife she kept requesting more insulin as she didn\u0027t believe he had memory loss.The twist: The man responsible only raped his wife and Leonard killed him years ago – he just can\u0027t remember it. His wife\u0027s actual killer is... himself. His real name? Sammy Jankis.The set-up: A grizzled boxing trainer seeks atonement by helping Hilary Swank\u0027s underdog amateur boxer, Maggie, achieve her dream of becoming a professional.The twist: Mid-way through the film, Maggie breaks her neck after being sucker punched during a fight. What was a feel-good underdog story swiftly turns into a hard-hitting drama about euthanasia.The set-up: Helping several others dodge the monsters lurking in the mist, David Drayton (Thomas Jane) leads the escape from the supermarket they’ve been holed up in. They reach a car and drive away, but soon run out of gas and realise there’s no hope. David loads a gun and, as the camera cuts away, shoots the survivors, including his young son. The twist: As he’s gearing up to put the gun to his own head, shadowy figures roll toward him. He’s devastated to learn it’s actually the military who have combatted the mist creatures. He killed his son for no reason. Talk about awful timing.The set-up: Oh Dae-Su (Choi Min-sik) is kidnapped and held in captivity for 15 years. When he\u0027s finally released, he exacts revenge with the help of a young girl named Mi-Do (Kang Hye-jung) whom he falls in love with.The twist: The girl is actually his daughter. His captors orchestrated their meeting.The set-up: The plot centres on a couple who, after the death of their unborn child, adopt a mysterious nine-year-old girl named Esther (Isabelle Furhman) who starts displaying some disturbing behaviour. The twist: Esther is actually a 33-year old murderer who has a condition stunting her physical growth. The set-up: Nicole Kidman stars as Grace, a mother who tries to protect her two children from supernatural forces in their Victorian mansion.The twist: In a spin on the ghost story, it turns out it\u0027s Grace and her children who are the ghosts: she killed them – before turning the gun on herself – in despair over the presumed death of her husband in World War II.The set-up: The film tracks the rivalry of two magicians, Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) and Rupert Angier (Hugh Jackman), who go to extreme lengths to outsmart one another, each pulling off tricks the other considers impossible.The twist: It emerges that Fallon, the bearded carer of Borden’s children, is actually his twin (he’s also played by Bale) while Angier’s technique is far more disturbing: each night, using Tesla’s technology, he sends his clone plummeting into a water tank.2437 Planet of the Apes (1968)The set-up: Three scientists wake up hundreds of years after being launched into space to discover they’ve landed on a planet where primates rule over humans, who are their prisoners.The twist: As Charlton Heston’s character escapes his cell, he eventually finds the Statue of Liberty protruding from sand. Turns out it’s not just any planet – it’s Earth.The set-up: A defence attorney (Richard Gere) has a strong belief that his stuttering altar boy client (Edward Norton) is not guilty of murdering an influential Catholic Archbishop. He\u0027s later found not guilty by reason of insanity after being diagnosed with multiple personality disorder.The twist: He faked the  disorder. The film\u0027s closing moments see him drop the stutter and reveal his guilt as his attorney looks on, disturbed.The set-up: What viewers initially think is a film about a theft committed by Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) turns out to be something far more darker. On the run, she arrives at a motel owned by Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) and is swiftly murdered by his mother.The twist: Only, it\u0027s not his mother – it’s Norman. He killed his mother years before and has since developed a split personality.The set-up: Having been chained up by the Jigsaw killer in a dilapidated bathroom – which has a corpse lying  in the middle of the room – photographer Adam (Leigh Whannell) overpowers and kills his captor. He rummages through his pockets, looking for the key that will unlock the chain around his leg, convinced the nightmare is finally over.The twist: Instead, he finds a cassette recorder that reveals his supposed captor was, in fact, another victim of the Jigsaw killer who was merely following his rules in order to obtain an antidote for a poison in his body. Cue a corpse in the middle of the room rising to reveal himself as the real Jigsaw killer. He was there the whole time.The set-up: David Mills (Brad Pitt) and retired PI William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) have closed in on serial killer, John Doe (Kevin Spacey), who has been using the seven deadly sins as inspiration for his murders.The twist: He has one final murder left to commit – only he’s already committed it. We discover Doe has killed Mills’s wife (Gwyneth Paltrow), which prompts him to complete Doe’s plan by murdering him out of wrath.The set-up: US Marshal Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his partner (Mark Ruffalo) arrive at a centre for the criminally insane to find an escaped killer who drowned her three children.The twist: Teddy is actually a patient, and his partner is his doctor. He killed his wife after she murdered their three children and the elaborate  ruse is an attempt to bring his repressed memories to the surface.The set-up: A young boy who can see dead people encounters a child psychologist named Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) and attempts to discover the reason behind his disturbing ability.The twist: Crowe is, in fact, dead all along. He got killed during a robbery that we see in the film’s opening scene.The set-up: The introverted Angela (Felissa Rose) becomes terrified when a murderer wreaks destruction at the same campsite where her brother Peter was killed eight years before.The twist: Angela is the killer. She\u0027s also not Angela at all, but her presumed dead brother Peter, who was raised as a girl by her aunt following Angela\u0027s death.3237 The Skin I Live In (2011)The twist: The Vera we\u0027re seeing is not wis wife, but a young man whom Robert abducted and subjected to a vaginoplasty six years before.The set-up: Peter Parker (Tom Holland) takes a break from trying to stop the film\u0027s villain, the Vulture (Michael Keaton), to go to his school\u0027s Homecoming dance. The twist: He shows up to his date\u0027s house, knocks on the door... and comes face to face with The Vulture. He\u0027s her father.The set-up: David Dunn survives a train crash that kills 130 passengers, and begins to believe he may have special powers. His life soon collides with comic book store owner Elijah (Samuel L Jackson), who has a rare bone disorder, and helps David discover he has the ability to see the criminal acts of those he comes into contact with. The twist: Elijah is the biggest criminal of them all. When David shakes his hand at the end of the film, he sees that “Mr Glass” is the mastermind behind numerous terrorist attacks – including the train crash he survived.The set-up: Verbal Kint (Kevin Spacey) reveals a criminal plot concocted by the notorious Keyser Soze. He\u0027s eventually set free.The twist He made the whole thing up – Kint is Keyser Soze.The set-up: A mother’s rift with her parents is healed when she sends her two children, who they’ve never met, to stay with them when she goes on holiday. All is going well until the kids become somewhat weirded out by their strange behaviour.The twist: Their mother becomes disturbed when she sees her parents while Skyping her children - it’s not them. It emerges that these imposters are mental home patients who murdered the couple, and have now taken up residence in their house. The twist: The girl was never missing – it was just an elaborate hoax to lure an out-of-towner so the island\u0027s residents could sacrifice him to their Sun God.The set-up: The services of linguistics professor Louise Banks (Amy Adams) are called upon when aliens arrive on Earth. While experiencing visions of her daughter, who we learn died from cancer in her teens, Louise attempts to communicate with the race in a bid to discern the purpose of their visit.The twist: Louise deciphers the language, which gives her the ability to see into the future. What we thought were flashbacks are, in fact, flash-forwards – her daughter is yet to be born.The set-up: Briony Tallis (Saoirse Ronan) falsely accuses the housekeeper’s son (James McAvoy) of raping her cousin when she becomes jealous of his relationship with her older sister (Keira Knightley).

The twist: After being confronted by Gittes, Evelyn reveals that Katherine is also her daughter – and the result of being raped by her father when she was 15.The set-up: IRA member Fergus (Stephen Rea) promises to protect Dil (Jaye Davidson), the girlfriend of a soldier his group has imprisoned, and soon begins an unexpected relationship with her.

Sammy Jankis.The set-up: A grizzled boxing trainer seeks atonement by helping Hilary Swank\u0027s underdog amateur boxer, Maggie, achieve her dream of becoming a professional.The twist: Mid-way through the film, Maggie breaks her neck after being sucker punched during a fight.

The film\u0027s closing moments see him drop the stutter and reveal his guilt as his attorney looks on, disturbed.The set-up: What viewers initially think is a film about a theft committed by Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) turns out to be something far more darker.

He rummages through his pockets, looking for the key that will unlock the chain around his leg, convinced the nightmare is finally over.The twist: Instead, he finds a cassette recorder that reveals his supposed captor was, in fact, another victim of the Jigsaw killer who was merely following his rules in order to obtain an antidote for a poison in his body. Cue a corpse in the middle of the room rising to reveal himself as the real Jigsaw killer. He was there the whole time.The set-up: David Mills (Brad Pitt) and retired PI William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) have closed in on serial killer, John Doe (Kevin Spacey), who has been using the seven deadly sins as inspiration for his murders.The twist: He has one final murder left to commit – only he’s already committed it.

He killed his wife after she murdered their three children and the elaborate  ruse is an attempt to bring his repressed memories to the surface.The set-up: A young boy who can see dead people encounters a child psychologist named Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) and attempts to discover the reason behind his disturbing ability.The twist: Crowe is, in fact, dead all along. He got killed during a robbery that we see in the film’s opening scene.The set-up: The introverted Angela (Felissa Rose) becomes terrified when a murderer wreaks destruction at the same campsite where her brother Peter was killed eight years before.The twist: Angela is the killer. She\u0027s also not Angela at all, but her presumed dead brother Peter, who was raised as a girl by her aunt following Angela\u0027s death.3237 The Skin I Live In (2011)The twist: The Vera we\u0027re seeing is not wis wife, but a young man whom Robert abducted and subjected to a vaginoplasty six years before.The set-up: Peter Parker (Tom Holland) takes a break from trying to stop the film\u0027s villain, the Vulture (Michael Keaton), to go to his school\u0027s Homecoming dance.

It was vital for the wellbeing of the nation, she said, that more people like her, a state-educated Northerner, were able to get on, to be presented with opportunity and fulfill their ability.When it came to questions, a hand went up. Social mobility was all very well, said her interrogator, but what did she feel about the closure of the Putney branch of Marks \u0026amp Spencer? There were murmurs of approval in the room –\u0026nbspthis was a subject dear to the audience’s heart. What was particularly galling, it turned out, was not only that the southwest London suburb was losing its cherished store, but that Putney was bracketed with a host of industrial towns in the North and Midlands that were being dropped by M\u0026ampS, the once bellwether of prosperity. It was shaming, humiliating.M\u0026ampS has just announced another raft of shops earmarked to go: Ashford, Bedford, Boston, Buxton, Cwmbran, Deal, Felixstowe, Huddersfield, Hull, Junction One Antrim Outlet, Luton Arndale, Newark, Northwich, Rotherham, Sutton Coldfield and Weston-super-Mare. The one in my hometown of Barrow-in-Furness, where my parents shopped for fresh food every day, is also on the list.The 17 proposed closures are part of the clothing, homeware and food retailer’s plan to shut more than 100 stores by 2022. So far, before this round, 30 stores have closed and another eight had already been named.M\u0026ampS announces next 17 stores to close down with 1,045 jobs at riskM\u0026ampS, Debenhams and John Lewis reveal disappointing Christmas salesNot just any tattoo: M\u0026ampS fan gets chain’s logo inked on forearmMarks \u0026amp Spencer profits grow as drastic store closure plan beginsThere will be more –\u0026nbspmany in the long-run beyond the 100. M\u0026ampS now has 979 stores in the UK, of which 615 sell only food. It’s the other 364, the larger branches that carry food, clothing and homeware, that are at risk.M\u0026ampS makes 75 per cent of its profits from just 70 of its shops. That gives some idea of the agonies that lie ahead for Steve Rowe, the chief executive and his management team, as they grapple with an estate that grew in a different age, when M\u0026ampS could do no wrong, when there was only M\u0026ampS and competition was not what it is today, when shoppers did not have cars and out-of-town did not exist, when they had to journey by bus to the high street and lug their bags and online had not been invented.But deciding to shut an M\u0026ampS store is not a simple act of putting a red line through a name. Of course, it entails loss of jobs, the erasing of a presence, the scrapping of community relationships, and harm to the neighbouring retailers who feed off the M\u0026ampS. It’s much more, though. To the places affected it’s seen as signifying rejection, that somehow they are not deemed “good enough” to have an M\u0026ampS.In many of those locations, the local M\u0026ampS is the lasting symbol of a formerly buzzing town centre, a sign of its aspiration and middle-classness. Often it’s the only such name left standing or there’s still a Debenhams or a House of Fraser, but they’re not likely to be around much longer.The folk in headquarters in London, have ruled they’re not fit for M\u0026ampS. That’s how they see it, that’s how the Putney people saw it.Closing an M\u0026ampS is to deal a devastating punch. There are other chains that have pulled down the shutters and in some cases vanished completely. M\u0026ampS, however, was still there, the icon that had catered for families for decades. While there was an M\u0026ampS there was a high street that looked recognisably like the high street of yesteryear there remained hope as well of a bustling, rich future. Not now.Of Marks \u0026amp Spencer’s profit comes from just 70 of its storesWhich is why, when an M\u0026ampS goes, all hell breaks loose. The MP gets involved, as do the council, local media, retail and business groups, community action campaigners, and inidual customers. The latter regard M\u0026ampS as theirs. To shut a shop is to drop them inidually.It’s not the same as a Boots, New Look, Topshop, WH Smith –\u0026nbsppick the departure of any brand, possibly with the exception of House of Fraser, and they do not have the same impact.An M\u0026ampS closure has to be handled sensitively. It’s not a case of issuing a bland statement from a regional director, and saying there will be a new food store opening nearby. This is what happened in Barrow’s case, where the town was told an M\u0026ampS Foodhall was coming to Ulverston seven miles away. Good for Ulverston, but of little compensation to the inhabitants of Barrow. It’s about researching how much the people understand about the reasons for closure, what would make up for their loss, discovering the language that helps them feel more positively, what could be done to soften the blow, to make them feel they were not being dumped (a much smaller Foodhall in Barrow, maybe, with click \u0026amp collect for online clothing and homeward purchases, or managing the property portfolio more imaginatively –\u0026nbspwhatever might be practical). And it’s about joining up those findings with discussions with the MP, council, local media and the rest.That’s not to be critical of M\u0026ampS. The retailer, more than any other, is caught in the bricks and mortar versus online battle. It’s not business in isolation, it’s capitalism with a conscience, a CEO and colleagues who must be politicians, diplomats, social workers, as much as naked pursuers of a idend.It’s an extremely current, modern position to hold. Gone are the days when businesses merely had to keep their shareholders sweet. Today, it’s about satisfying a whole gamut of stakeholders, who, thanks to the internet, are in easy receipt of information and have an instant, fierce voice. M\u0026ampS may be on troubled times but those times are shared by others. In that sense it remains very much the bellwether.

It now offers two credit cards and a fixed saver account, alongside an app that allows users to manage their money across different accounts in one place.Revolut: UK digital bank targets 10 million customers by 2020January 13 marks one\u0026nbspyear since the introduction of open banking legislation that forced banks to share customer details with rival services.\u0026nbspTandem is gaining traction alongside other digital banks such as Monzo, Starling and banking services firm Revolut in a race to acquire software that will attract users away from traditional lenders. At 500,000 users, Tandem is still significantly smaller than Monzo, which hit 1 million users in September, while Revolut has 3 million.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialIn January, RBS entered the digital banking market with a £2 million investment in Loot, a startup to help students manage their finances, through Natwest’s digital-only retail bank, Bo.Providers have so far failed to convert a growing number of users into profit. Tandem made a pre-tax loss of £23.6 million in 2017 and while losses narrowed in 2018, Knox says the company does not expect to turn a profit until 2020.Tandem makes money in the same way as traditional banks, by charging interest on credit. It also takes commission if a customer switches its utility bill on a recommendation. Knox says it makes less money per customer than the incumbents: £40 compared to £200 or more at the average bank. “We genuinely are trying to make you better off,” Knox says. “That’s not what Barclays\u0027 mission is.”Knox is a fintech veteran. He already had four companies to his name by the time he started Tandem in 2014 with co-founders Matt Cooper, a former managing director at Capital One, and Michael Kent, who previously worked with Knox on payments companies Small World FS and Azimo. “All of my businesses are purpose driven at some level,” Knox says. “My main mission is to sort people’s finances out.”One of Tandem’s goals, when it launched, was to help customers getting through the month without running out of money. Their market research pre-launch revealed that this was a major area of concern for potential customers. “Customers find that more of a problem than saving,” Knox says. “The solution to prevent people running out of money is aligning income with outcome. That\u0027s what we focussed on last year.”The company acquired Pariti, an app that helps users keep track of spending, in March 2018. Pariti tracks how much a user is spending on debt repayments and suggests changes to help someone pay off their debt more quickly.In September, Tandem introduced an auto-saving feature in beta. It works by topping-up transactions to send excess cash from a current account to a Tandem flexible-saver account, or by rounding-up an aggregate of transactions to set aside as much as someone can afford at the end of the week. “Lots of our customers have told us that they want to save but they can\u0027t do it,” he says. “A direct debit is inflexible.”The company is preparing to roll out the smart savings app to all customers in the coming weeks.While Tandem was built for millennials, the average customer is more likely to be in their 30s than their 20s. “Our service helps you sort out your finances and that\u0027s more likely to appeal to people in the 30s,” Knox says. “I don\u0027t know about you but when I was in my 20s I had more important things to worry about!”He describes 2018 as a year of building the business, while 2019 will be about scaling the bank internationally and integrating all of its current software into one solution. Tandem’s current suite of services is built to appeal to customers who may want to keep their current account with a main provider, while taking advantage of benefits such as free transactions abroad with the cash back credit card, or higher interest on fixed-term saving accounts.Unlike Mozo and Starling, Tandem does not offer a day-to-day spending account, or a pre-paid card. “If you have an account and want to work with new banking services, but not move your money across, our offer works better in that hybrid space,” Knox says.The absence of a pan-European bank allowing users to make transactions in foreign currency without incurring fees is one area of opportunity for digital banks. So far, European expansion has proved tricky. When Revolut started in 2015, it focussed on free overseas transfers but later moved into cryptocurrency. Monzo introduced fees for overseas cash machine withdrawals in 2018, claiming that free withdrawals were “unsustainable”.Knox says Tandem has put plans to expand in Germany on hold until after March 2019 and the UK\u0027s exit from the EU: “We were going to open deposit accounts in Germany but then we got a letter saying you’ll be illegal after March.” The company closed the few accounts that it had. “We’re going to see how it pans out,” Knox says.In the meantime, Tandem is turning its attention to Asia. In November, it announced a £15 million investment from Convoy Global Holdings, a Hong Kong-based financial advisor, putting it on a footing to open one of the first digital banks in Hong Kong. This brings the total funding raised to £39.3 million.UK bank ranking 2018: TSB falls to bottom while Monzo comes out on topKnox says Tandem will need to double its user base and become profitable before it can consider an IPO. “Ultimately, the challenge is do you have enough scale to support the overheads that being a public company brings,” he says. “Sadly just being a bank brings a massive overhead, which also means you are an appropriate size to IPO.”But it’s not just scale Knox is working towards: “Could we IPO within a couple of years? Certainly. Is it on my priorities list? I think we probably want to run private a little longer than that.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The streaming service almost doubled operating profit in the fourth quarter – it rose from $245m (£189m) in the last three months of 2017 to $447m – and revenue grew to $3.7bn from $3.3bn.

George Salmon, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said it was notable that Netflix is “now confident enough to use price increases to slash its cash flow deficit even faster”.“You can only squeeze customers so far, but we think there’s a way to go before the pips squeak. The average customer spends around 10 hours a week on the service, which works out at around 25 cents an hour. Hard to argue that isn’t value for money,” he added.“The worry, of course, is that international bruisers like Disney and Amazon aren’t going to go down without a fight, and both have the financial clout to counterpunch pretty hard. The battle for viewers’ eyeballs is only just getting started.”Analysts also pointed out that Thursday’s share price movement should be taken in the context of 50 per cent stock growth since Christmas Eve. “The fact that investors reacted negatively to what amounted to a strong performance indicates the extent to which Netflix has set a high bar,” said Paul Verna, media analyst at eMarketer. “The bottom line is that Netflix remains the uncontested leader in the subscription video space.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Chief among them is an activity known as credential stuffing, where the logins are plugged into a wide variety of services in a fast and automated way, in the hope of finding websites where people have re-used the stolen emails and passwords.Security experts advise people to use different passwords and change them regularly, so that stolen passwords cannot be used. Those can be stored by a password manager, of the kind now built into Apple\u0027s iOS and MacOS.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The band appear reinvigorated, brimming with energy and self-assurance.Brent Cobb’s music is built around people and places. The country artist returns after the release of his acclaimed 2016 album Shine On Rainy Day with Providence Canyon a slice of blue-collar country offering fresh tales of Southern lifeThe Brighton metal band’s sublime second album is their most ambitious to date. Enlisting Adrian Bushby (Foo Fighters, Muse) on production was a master-stroke – with his help they offer up vast sonic landscapes that recall the drama of Darion Malakian’s Scars on Broadway record, DictatorOne moment opining the joys of leaving a party to pluck your eyebrows, the next raging over the gaslighting of assault survivors, Miya Folick’s debut album continues her habit of cracking the shiny veneer of pop, and unsettling the exceptions put upon a feminine voiceThough their themes remain in the gutter, Suede aspire to monuments, and The Blue Hour will stand as another sordid masterworkSix years after the release of her last LP Sun, Cat Power – whose struggles with alcoholism, addiction and mental health issues have been much publicised – demonstrates “both a newfound sense of calm, and strength” on her new albumHoly Hell offers up some of the best tracks of the band’s career, with a through-line that maintains Tom Searle\u0027s role as an integral part of Architects, particularly on “Doomsday”, while “Hereafter” feels like the song that launches the album’s momentum. Listening to vocalist Sam Carter scream: “I wasn’t braced for the fallout” is intensely cathartic – even non-metal fans will find it hard not to be moved by the band’s sincerity. (RO)Even in discarding such basic pop necessities as melody, Robyn has managed to create a masterpiece. With her first album in seven years, the Swedish singer delivers nine songs that glow and pulse with bittersweet sensuality, sung in a voice that sifts over the synths like icing sugar1040 31. Florence \u0026amp the Machine - High as HopeOn Florence \u0026amp The Machine’s latest album High As Hope, her voice is just as powerful when she holds back. She seems to attribute much of this calmness to her new-found sobriety – she quit alcohol a few years ago and looks back on her twenties with a mix of fondness and regret1140 30. Teyana Taylor - Keep that Same EnergyShe’s not restricted by genre constraints, and K.T.S.E. (Keep That Same Energy) is a pleasant surprise. Embellished with producer Kanye West’s keen ear for samples, it blends Eighties nostalgia with fresh rap and R\u0026ampB. At the core of the project is Taylor’s love of pleasing herself, her relationship with her husband, and being a mother1240 29. The 1975 – A Brief Inquiry into Online RelationshipsOn their third and best album, A Brief Inquiry into Online Relationships, The 1975 have created what so many post-Radiohead bands couldn’t: a coherent pop statement with enough hope, radical honesty and genre-ning breadth to make sense across ided generations1340 28. Kamasi Washington - Heaven and EarthFor a new generation, Kamasi Washington is largely responsible for the revitalised interest in jazz in modern music, most notably with his work on Kendrick Lamar’s jazz-heavy masterpiece, To Pimp a Butterfly. On Heaven and Earth, the Los Angeles saxophonist and band leader splits his second record in two halves: the urgent Earth side explores reality while Heaven deals in dreamy opulenceThe 21-year-old south London MC Novelist’s debut album is a clear, concise look at the current social and political landscape of the UK, offering up astute observations on black masculinity and the music industry along the way.The German composer’s 10th solo album is a stirring, complex work that draws on the concept of connection a fluidity in the way the universe worksCamila Cabello\u0027s debut solo album is the first time fans have been able to see her clearlyOn Mitski\u0027s brilliant fifth album she is desperate and lonely one minute, hardened and withdrawn the next. Her music, which exists in a space between fierce, guitar-led walls of noise and soft, delicate balladry, feels like an open wound – and Be The Cowboy is no different. (AP)Frontman Olly Alexander is offering fans their own generational pop icon: a young man who has the courage to put all of that vibrant, dynamic character on full displayOn Tell Me How You Really Feel, Courtney Barnett turns her keen eye inwards, exploring anxiety and depression while coming to terms with her own emotional life. Written as her burgeoning stature and hectic touring schedule began to take their toll, these 10 songs are Barnett’s attempt to work through her vulnerability and sadnessFor Negro Swan, Blood Orange’s fourth album, the multi-instrumentalist has dreamed up a 16-song suite that weaves together impressionist psych-pop and interstellar funk, late-Seventies Marvin Gaye and early-Eighties Prince, with some tangled ballads and insomniac blues reminiscent of Elliott Smith and King Krule thrown into the pot2140 20. Cardi B - Invasion of PrivacyWhen she sings off the hook, it’s just another moment where Cardi B runs to her own rhythm: because nothing about Invasion of Privacy is formulaicWith producer SOPHIE on board (whose own album, also released this year, is well worth your time), they explore the anxieties and frustrations of being a teenage girl through clattering beats and Nokia samples. The result is exceptionalGhetts re-evaluates much of what he said on Ghetto Gospel, when he was frustrated and angry with the world. Now he looks more to the future, whether on “Next of Kin”, where he speaks from the perspective of a mother carrying her child’s coffin, or “Black Rose”, which addresses fears for his daughter in a society that places double standards on black women. It’s a reminder that grime is so much more than violence and threats. (RO)2440 17. Cypress Hill – Elephants on AcidElephants on Acid is a 21-track monster, loaded with twists and turns that take you as far as Egypt, where Muggs recorded much of “Band of Gypsies” – teaming up with artists on oud, sitar, keyboard and guitar, as well as some of its street musicians. Its lead hook harks back to the glitchy shrieks of “How I Could Just Kill a Man” from their eponymous 1991 debut.His brilliant fourth album Love Is Magic takes listeners on a similar thrill ride, dominated by swirling loops of grand, romantic melody, sly twists of sardonic wit and heart-stopping drops of sheer honestyHis third record, produced entirely by Kanye West, could easily have been an EP, coming in at just seven songs and 21 minutes. While many fans were disappointed by the erratic and self-indulgent nature of some of West’s other releases, including his own album ye, the beats on Daytona are sample-heavy and superb the instrumentation is sparse but all the more impactful for itSince her debut single – the AK Paul-featuring “So Good” – was released in 2014, London-based singer-songwriter NAO has hovered around a near-perfect brand of sultry, neo-soul-inflected R\u0026ampB. Four years later, and she seems to have mastered itThe third solo album from the US artist stars an overwhelming number of (uncredited) guest features, producers and co-writers, but, ultimately, it’s his own, most career-defining work to date. Bloom captures the A to Z’s of modern queer love with pinpoint precisionHoward’s music has always, above all, reflected the shifts and moods in nature, while he sings poetic lyrics in his signature low, warm murmur. On Noonday Dream, he expands on the Cornish landscape that impacted his earlier work and brings in sounds and instruments that spark the imagination for places further afield, in the most exquisite way3140 10. Shame – Songs of PraiseDistinguishing themselves from the hordes of other white, indie guitar bands that emerged around summer 2017, south London natives Shame manage to make raw, bleeding anger on their debut album sound articulate.Gaika broke new ground on the UK music scene and asserted himself as one of the most provocative and multitalented young artists of this generation with his debut album, Basic VolumeTamino’s music on his debut Amir draws on the old-world romance of his grandfather – a famous Arabic musician and actor ¬– but also embodies the genre-less quality of much modern pop. The musical heritage that is so essential to the 22-year-old’s sound comes to life in the dramatic, sweeping instrumentation on a song like “So It Goes” haunting, graceful violins, bold drum beats and the shimmer of a tambourine transport the listener entirely.Mac Miller turned his anguish into one of the year’s most disarming records3540 6. Colter Wall - Song of the PlainsWall’s songwriting is as stark as it comes: his plain-speaking manner is delivered in a slow, melancholy drawl that paints him as some lonely cowboy – the last man of the West, as he describes in the most matter-of-fact terms how a bullet ripped in to “poor Wild Bill”. There’s no fuss in the instrumentation, either, mostly just gentle picking or brisk, deep thrums on Wall’s acoustic guitar, which are bolstered by icy laps of pedal steel and the occasional harmonica. It’s effective in the simplest of ways – and allows the listener’s imagination to do the restKendrick Lamar co-executive produced the Black Panther soundtrack, has writing credits on its 14 tracks, and appears in various skits and features. But his most essential job on this album is that of the curator, as he brings in a staggering array of talent – from Anderson .Paak, SZA and Future to South African gqom (EDM) artist Babes Wodumo and alt-rapper Yungen Blakrok.Kacey Musgraves third album flips between wide-eyed country pop and disco-electronica. Aided by co-writers and producers Daniel Tashian and Ian Fitchuk – both Nashville stalwarts – Musgraves conjures up a feeling of lightness as she melds the traditional and futuristic.Dirty Computer is Monáe’s gift to the LGBT+ community, non-binary people, black men and women… anyone who faces stigma and abuse just for embracing their true selves. It’s a message of love and hope to anyone who fears what is different, but who has capacity to learn and know better. And it’s seemingly a gift to herself, as well. (RO)Tranquility Base Hotel \u0026amp Casino feels more like an interlude between AM and a seventh Arctic Monkeys album – a delve into the bizarre, where even the Steinway piano has its own character. On “The Ultracheese”, the descending piano chords symbolise a kind of final bow the last soliloquy of the night before the curtain closes. Few bands today are as brave as this.Letissier makes her vintage synths snap, crackle, pop, fizz, freeze, squelch, shimmer and soar. There’s even a shattered glass effect (on “Stranger”) to complete the Old Skool Electronica bingo card. Treble notes bounce from air-cushioned soles. Bass lines lasso your hips. Chiffon layers of Letissier’s Anglo-French vocals glide around your neck and shoulders and roll them back. It’s ridiculously danceable.Thom Yorke’s first ever soundtrack summons the darkness of horror, and the terror of blood and evil, over 25 tracks.Marauder is Interpol’s most experimental to date, blending everything from rough garage rock to Motown rhythms.

Angry at living under feudal rules, this\u0026nbspclass of mortgaged renters want the homes they paid for, says Harry ScoffinClick to followThe IndependentIllustrations by Dilruba TayfunThe sun is out in London’s\u0026nbspDocklands. In the emerging metropolis at the east side of the capital, where cranes are a permanent feature of the skyline and one-bed flats can go for up to a million pounds, trendy Hubbub Bar \u0026amp Kitchen is the last place you would expect to hear words like injustice and exploitation.\u0026nbspOutside in the beer garden, local residents gather over drinks to discuss possible names for a new self-help group. “Leasehold Freedom Fighters” is rejected for sounding too political. After some discussion, they settle on “Friends in High Places”.\u0026nbspAs the first meeting concludes, contact details are exchanged. They plan to meet again.With Canary Wharf on the doorstep, and the long-awaited Elizabeth Line set to make the West End a 12-minute hop away, it is striking to find people so unhappy with where they are living.\u0026nbspBut leasehold does not care if you are rich or poor. It preys on those who have the home ownership dream, keen to avoid paying sky-high rents.This erse group s bankers, media types, public sector and office workers, alongside retirees. Some have lived in the area long before its re-development and gentrification. While it might be difficult to shed a tear for those fortunate enough to have bought in such a sought-after location, these people have in fact found common cause with a group of northern working-class mums, who last year established the National Leasehold Campaign (NLC) to tackle similar issues.Rent arrears more than double under universal credit, figures showFrom newbuild houses on private estates across the northwest, to fancy flats in the shiny residential towers crowding the Isle of Dogs, properties originally marketed as offering ‘home ownership’ are uniting people up and down the country in a shared concern.As London expands and demand for homes across the southeast continues to grow, developers are building ever higher and at much greater densities. Leasehold tenure is exploding as more and more flats are constructed.\u0026nbspUnfortunately, many of\u0026nbspthose who do manage to leave the rental market, proudly brandishing the keys to their new home, fail to understand what leasehold means until it’s too late.When you “buy”\u0026nbspa leasehold flat, you are buying the right to occupy it for a certain length of time. Think of it as a long-term rental, with the minimum term 99 years. You pay most of this upfront. You’ll probably have to take out a mortgage to cover the purchase costs.\u0026nbspBut it’s not ‘yours’.\u0026nbspYou don’t own the flat, the building, or any of the land on which it sits.\u0026nbspYou have effectively signed up to become a renter with a mortgage.\u0026nbspEven the law calls you a tenant.The landowner, known as the freeholder, nominally owns the building and is your landlord. He or she will appoint a managing agent to run the estate, often on a\u0026nbspcommission basis. The freeholder\u0026nbspenjoys an annual ground rent from you, which is essentially\u0026nbspprofit, unconnected to services that might be provided to tenants (cleaning of communal areas, for instance), which also come at a cost.Through control of the managing agent, the landlord can choose how high the service charges are set (although the law states that charges must be ‘reasonable’). And he has the all-important power to award contracts to anyone he chooses to undertake works, irrespective of the cost, quality or (say critics) even necessity of the job. But you have to pick up the tab. Every time.\u0026nbspThere are short and long leases, with leases running down to below the 80-year mark deeply unattractive and hard to remortgage.Although your charming estate agent may suggest that a 999-year lease is as good as owning the property outright, this is still a glorified tenancy.\u0026nbspYou will still have to deal with a landlord and his agents\u0026nbspwhen things go wrong.The landlord has the all-important power to award contracts to anyone he chooses, irrespective of the cost, quality or even necessity of the job. But you have to pick up the tab“Recently we have seen an erroneous narrative being propagated that freeholders are ‘noble custodians’ of the building and\u0026nbspserve some valuable service to the leaseholders. Nothing could be further from the truth,” says Louie Burns, managing director of Leasehold Solutions. He describes them as an asset class, using feudal property laws to make themselves owners of the buildings by proxy. “They own the buildings to make as much money as they possibly can from them,” he adds. “It shames us as a nation that this feudal, iniquitous system is still thriving in the 21st century when the rest of the world have rid themselves from it.”But how could such an unjust system come into being in the first place? Home ownership falls more in UK than any other EU countryAfter seizing all land in the name of the crown, and under threat from the landowners he had just dispossessed, the new King William I had to act fast to stay in power. The year was 1067. He consolidated his regime by gifting some of his land to a highly select group of people. These palace favourites, the lords, rushed to break the freehold land into tiny parcels\u0026nbspand sell them on as leases to lesser men\u0026nbspfor agrarian use. The\u0026nbspinnovation allowed for a perpetual form of land ownership. Leasehold would continue to shape patterns of class formation in early modern England, becoming a key instrument of capital accumulation for the wealthy during the industrial revolution. As people deserted the countryside for the cities, the descendants of William the Conqueror’s noble class\u0026nbspwere uniquely well placed to seize the opportunities of this new era. With their monopoly on land, they introduced “building leases”\u0026nbspto allow for the building of flats on their estates. Hard-working people became glorified tenants, with\u0026nbspfreeholders gorging on the ground rents, license and permission fees, building insurance and maintenance charges. Fast-forward 200\u0026nbspyears, and little has changed.With nine\u0026nbspout of 10 newbuild properties being sold as leasehold in London today, this is a rigged market. If you want a flat, it almost has to be leasehold. Although there is an established co-operative mode of property ownership for flats, “share of freehold”, this has been shunned by developers and investors as it offers none of the lucrative opportunities that they enjoy with leasehold.A newer, more advanced form of tenure, “commonhold”, made the statute books in the early 2000s. Commonholders, unlike leaseholders, would own their flats outright and, through an association, own and manage the common areas collectively. With no third-party landlord, residents would be in the driving seat. They would appoint the managing agent. Curiously, London has just one commonhold scheme in existence.Although it was assumed that commonhold would ultimately\u0026nbspmake leasehold obsolete, as savvy buyers sought\u0026nbsptrue home ownership, it never took root because of vested interests and poorly drafted legislation. Conservative MP Crispin Blunt blames leaving it to the market. By splitting the land into freehold and leasehold interests, developers can sell leasehold properties to unsuspecting buyers, pocketing the ground rents through their continued ownership of the freehold, and make a fortune in the process. Still not satisfied, many choose to sell on the freehold to faceless offshore investors. What to Look for When Buying Within a Development“Profit making businesses such as housing developers cannot be expected\u0026nbspto freely and voluntarily disclose their own ‘monetisation maximisation’ model,”\u0026nbspBlunt says.The MP’s intervention raises questions about our democratic politics. Twenty years after\u0026nbspgovernment described the leasehold system as “flawed to its roots”, the question remains:\u0026nbspwhy haven’t we killed it\u0026nbspoff yet? Is the corporate lobbyist really more powerful than the consumer homebuyer?There is growing anger from leaseholders in flats who want to be free of “hold”.\u0026nbspWe hear their stories at the Isle of Dogs beer garden. They have suffered in silence for many years and paid the service charges without question. Yet because these increased\u0026nbspmodestly each year, leaseholders often didn’t know\u0026nbspwhat was happening until they found themselves struggling to sell their leases on the open market. Their home was a depreciating asset all along, even with a residential tenure supposed to last a millennium. The financial nightmare gets even worse when buildings are left to deteriorate –\u0026nbspthe condition of tower blocks has little to no impact on the value of the freehold title or associated ground rent portfolio. The freehold landlord has bought a cash machine. He doesn’t need to worry about keeping the leaseholders happy.And those leaseholders who went\u0026nbsppublic with their experience in the past risked\u0026nbspangering their neighbours, who did\u0026nbspnot want to see the value of their homes affected by negative publicity\u0026nbspsome faced threats of legal action from the freehold landlord. And when your landlord controls every element of the way your block is run, right down to whether your windows get cleaned, it is understandable that many people preferred to stay\u0026nbspquiet.Unsuspecting first-time buyers signed leases with toxic doubling ground rent clauses.\u0026nbspWhen they wanted to buy the freehold, they found it had been sold on to shadowy offshore investors\u0026nbspThings changed when the big developers applied the leasehold model to houses, many of which were made available through the government’s Help to Buy scheme. They targeted the northwest, where 69 per cent\u0026nbspof houses sold in 2016 were leasehold. Unsuspecting first-time buyers signed leases with toxic doubling ground rent clauses. And when they wanted to buy the freehold, they found it had been sold on to shadowy\u0026nbspinvestors who had either taken it off the market or quadrupled the cost.Trapped in unsellable, newbuild leasehold houses, three brave women decided to take on the industry and government. They wielded placards outside new housing developments that were being sold off-plan, warning prospective buyers to avoid leasehold products. They even had themselves chained up as they sat in mock prison cells. Politicians and the media started taking notice, with the wider “fake home ownership”\u0026nbspscandal coming under scrutiny.Half of leasehold house owners didn’t know what they were buyingJoanne Darbyshire, a co-founder of the NLC, says the campaign moved quickly to broaden its reach by articulating the experiences of leaseholders in flats. “It didn’t take long for us to realise that the leasehold scandal was so much more than leasehold newbuild houses,” she says.\u0026nbsp“Newbuild flats were also being sold with onerous ground rent terms and we learnt about the immoral and unethical behaviour of a number of freeholders. We knew the NLC had to campaign for all leaseholders.”With more than 12,000 people now part of the NLC Facebook group, which is being used to direct leaseholders to complete consultations on reform, Darbyshire and her fellow campaigners are giving those who live in flats a newfound confidence to stand up and be counted. After the northwest, London is the next highest represented area on the NLC.Labour MP Jim Fitzpatrick, whose constituents are attempting to overcome collective action problems with Friends in High Places, says: “Whether it is spiralling service charges, inflated refurbishment costs, fraudulent insurance premiums, obstructing residents’ associations being formed or various other ways to cheat decent residents, including forfeiture, the rules have to change.” His Poplar and Limehouse constituency has the second highest number of leasehold properties in the country, after the City\u0026nbspof London and City of Westminster. In 2016, Poplar and Limehouse saw the highest number of leasehold properties sold across England and Wales, at 97 per cent.Whether it is spiralling service charges, inflated refurbishment costs, fraudulent insurance premiums, or various other ways to cheat decent residents, including forfeiture, the rules have to changeAnxious to ease the housing crisis, Tower Hamlets council is\u0026nbspapproving leasehold developments all the time. It\u0026nbspdid not respond to requests for data on what some have identified as a new, more disturbing trend within the murky world of leasehold. The emergence of mixed-use schemes, where squeezed local authority and prospective buyer are enticed by the prospect of building a new school, doctors’ surgery, bars, restaurants and shops under newbuild flats, demonstrates the way leasehold is taking over. Where buildings are over 25 per cent\u0026nbspnon-residential, developers have artfully curtailed residential rights to almost nothing.An investor who gains the freehold of a mixed-use building can use his total control of the service charges from the residential floors to subsidise his commercial operations. Of course he’s not supposed to do this, but the ease with which service charge accounts can be delayed and fudged, and residential spending conflated with commercial makes it a temptation few will resist. If you don’t need to pick up the tab, why would you?The freehold landlord is safe in the knowledge that while\u0026nbspleaseholders theoretically hold the power to win disputes at\u0026nbspthe property tribunal, the chances of them finding the time and resources to cobble a case together against him are slim. People have lives, families, jobs. How many can dedicate the months, if not years, a legal battle can take? And why should a flat dweller have to go to court to force his landlord to clean his windows or repair his lifts or employ decent door staff for a reasonable cost? Especially when that landlord can bill him through the service charge for his own legal costs. Yes, go to the tribunal and if you lose you cold pay both sides’ legal costs. Think of that playground game where the bully forces his victim to smack himself round his own face and you’ve pretty much got the leaseholder’s plight.And to top it all off, the tribunal is not even a court equivalent. According to Christopher Howarth, a senior researcher working in the House of Commons:\u0026nbsp“It does not have the time or interest for long and complex cases, does not take evidence on oath and is easily swayed by the legal firepower at the disposal of large landlords.”Lacking the ability to break free of “hold”\u0026nbspby buying out the freeholder, through a process known as enfranchisement, and also barred from the Right to Manage (RTM), a way of cutting out the landlord by making the managing agent accountable to leaseholders only, flat dwellers in mixed-use developments are in a special kind of leasehold hell.The Law Commission, which has been tasked by government to review the law on enfranchisement to make it “easier, cheaper and quicker”, claims there is no need to change the arbitrary 25 per cent\u0026nbsprule. As developers move away from buildings that are predominantly residential, officials seem to be turning a blind eye to the fact that many more families and young people are set to fall into the leasehold property trap. The Law Commission has been\u0026nbspinviting views on its enfranchisement. Leaseholders will certainly be kept busy, with a commission spokesperson confirming that “the Right to Manage consultation paper will be published in early 2019, and the consultation will last for two months”.They say reform is on its way. But John Paterson, a veteran leasehold campaigner, is not hopeful. He says the government has known about the outrageous racket of leasehold housing since the 1980s. But there has been no meaningful change.High hopes for rent-to-own clampdown but UK’s poorest will struggleX Factor finalists’ house for rent for £12.5k a monthWhat’s next for Generation Rent?Paterson feels sure he knows where this latest chapter will end. “The government likes to stick with 1925 Law of Property and the idea of caveat emptor.\u0026nbspIt will consider that it has warned of the problems of leasehold tenure and, therefore, if iniduals fail to heed these warnings it is their own fault.”Paterson is not far off. The current administration seems content to sit back and watch existing leaseholders face surging ground rents. It hides behind the argument that intervention would set a ‘dangerous’ precedent. However, they are not warning of the problems of applying leasehold to flats. If anything, they have embarked on “Project Save Leasehold”. While\u0026nbspThatcher, Major and Blair envisaged the end of leasehold, May’s administration defends the feudal system. The ruling party sees a cross-class alliance conspiring to bring it down –\u0026nbspand it doesn’t like it. Just last month, Heather Wheeler, the minister for housing and homelessness, claimed in parliament that “leasehold can be an effective tool for making multiple-ownership more straightforward”. Within minutes, her claim was ridiculed online. In surprising numbers, leaseholders were citing US condominium and Australian strata-title as superior models to the leasehold regime.Wheeler’s colleague, the housing secretary James Brokenshire, has demonstrated his personal commitment to “Project Save Leasehold”. He is engaging in what campaigners have called “death-by-consultation”. Not only that, he is actively sabotaging the plans of his predecessor, Sajid Javid. Private Eye says choosing to set ground rents on new leases at £10, as opposed to making them zero financial value, will ensure leasehold persists.With a housing target of 300,000 new homes a year by the mid-2020s, existing leaseholders are pained at the thought of yet more innocent homebuyers falling into the leasehold property trap.\u0026nbspAs a party which\u0026nbspsays it is\u0026nbspcommitted to the principle of home ownership, it is ironic that the Conservatives are effectively\u0026nbspforbidding young people from owning their own homes by allowing flats to be sold as tenancies. England and Wales are the only countries left that have this feudal system. In failing to act against this burning injustice, the Conservative Party may very well be signing its death warrant.Back in the Isle of Dogs beer garden, leaseholders mention a new development going up. They call it “Desmond Town”. Richard Desmond, the ex-press baron, wants to create an income stream of more than 1,500 new homes. There will be a new secondary school, healthcare services, lifestyle facilities, and restaurants and bars. Unfortunately, residents will have no way of buying him out. And if current rules stay the same, they will have no ability to get control of their building and service charges. As London Docklands continues to be a construction site, Friends in High Places has a huge fight on its\u0026nbsphands to end leasehold for good.help to buyOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

George Salmon, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said it was notable that Netflix is “now confident enough to use price increases to slash its cash flow deficit even faster”.“You can only squeeze customers so far, but we think there’s a way to go before the pips squeak. The average customer spends around 10 hours a week on the service, which works out at around 25 cents an hour. Hard to argue that isn’t value for money,” he added.“The worry, of course, is that international bruisers like Disney and Amazon aren’t going to go down without a fight, and both have the financial clout to counterpunch pretty hard. The battle for viewers’ eyeballs is only just getting started.”Analysts also pointed out that Thursday’s share price movement should be taken in the context of 50 per cent stock growth since Christmas Eve. “The fact that investors reacted negatively to what amounted to a strong performance indicates the extent to which Netflix has set a high bar,” said Paul Verna, media analyst at eMarketer. “The bottom line is that Netflix remains the uncontested leader in the subscription video space.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The Independent accompanies her as she makes the complex journey with a five-month-old childClick to followThe Independent“I haven’t been sleeping properly,”\u0026nbspsays Faloshade Olayiwole, 35, zipping her smiley five-month-old into a donated puffer coat. It’s\u0026nbsp8am in Stoke-on-Trent, and the single mother has been ordered to report to a Home Office centre 50 miles away in three hours’ time or risk being detained.\u0026nbspThe Nigerian national is too nervous to eat. “I’m so anxious about my asylum claim anyway. This has made me more stressed,”\u0026nbspshe says, placing two bottles of milk in a bag. The journey is to Manchester –\u0026nbspa five-hour round trip on multiple\u0026nbsptrains and trams – and with no childcare, she is going to have to take her baby.Faloshade is one of around 500 asylum seekers in Stoke-on-Trent forced to take this journey after the Home Office closed their local immigration reporting centre. Over the past year, centres have been closing across the country, including in Portsmouth, Bristol and Nottingham, as a way\u0026nbspto “more effectively manage”\u0026nbspthe reporting population, which includes thousands of asylum seekers.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialCharities say the closures mean disabled people and parents with young children must make long and expensive journeys to “sign on” in compliance\u0026nbspwith immigration rules – already a traumatic\u0026nbspexperience for many – but the Home Office refuses to cap the distance they can be told to travel.Faloshade’s other daughter\u0026nbspNaomi, aged nine,\u0026nbspis getting ready for school. She wears a blazer and tie and packs her school books from the window sill in her tiny, sparse bedroom. “It’s hard living here. My friends’ rooms are full of teddy bears and they’re painted, but I can’t do that,” she says in an eloquent northern accent. “There isn’t room to do very much. I do my homework on the floor.”Naomi has been in Britain since the age of four, but has only known what it’s like to live in asylum accommodation. Her baby sister, Shekinah, sleeps in a\u0026nbspMoses basket that is too small for her\u0026nbspbecause they can’t fit a proper cot in her mother’s bedroom. With no bath, Faloshade has to bathe her in a tub on the bathroom floor.A recent government-commissioned found that asylum seeking families in Britain are residing in unsuitable housing that failed to their meet basic needs, with almost half of asylum properties deemed not fit for purpose.\u0026nbspThe Home Affairs Select Committee meanwhile accused the Home Office of failing to act on warnings that\u0026nbspmothers with small children were living in homes with vermin, damp and inadequate facilities and furnishings.But Faloshade explains that the alternative –\u0026nbspto return to Nigeria –\u0026nbspis not a viable option. She left in 2014 after years of sexual and emotional abuse from her mother and stepfather, which culminated when they insisted that Naomi undergo female genital mutilation (FGM) – a procedure\u0026nbspFaloshade underwent as a child and one which still causes her pain today.\u0026nbspHer asylum claim was recently rejected on the grounds that she had a lack of evidence, and she is now going through the\u0026nbspappeals process.Mother and baby forced to travel 100 miles to sign on with Home OfficeFewer\u0026nbspthan a third of asylum claims in the UK were granted last year, down 4 per cent on the year before. The final grant rate increases to around 50 per cent following appeal –\u0026nbspwith record levels of refusals being overturned in court. Lawyers have raised concerns about this, warning\u0026nbspthat\u0026nbspeach error or delay can\u0026nbsphave a devastating effect on someone’s\u0026nbsplife.Faloshade’s journey begins at 8.20am. She won’t have time to walk Naomi to school, so drops her at the home of a local friend who has agreed to take her. It is cold and the wind bites. She pulls the pram’s rain cover over Shekinah\u0026nbspand after kissing Naomi goodbye, embarks on the\u0026nbsp15-minute walk to Stoke-on-Trent station.On arriving, she buys her train ticket: £12\u0026nbspfor a return ticket to Manchester Piccadilly,\u0026nbspa third of her weekly support from the Home Office. Under current rules, people seeking asylum are prevented from working while their claims are being processed. Despite the Home Office target time for decisions being six months, almost half wait for longer, with some waiting years. In the meantime\u0026nbspthey receive a weekly sum of £37.75 to live on.“It’s not enough,” says Faloshade, sitting in the waiting room. “Baby milk alone is £11 each week. The church and charities give us clothes and sometimes food. I don’t know how we would live otherwise.”The train pulls into the station at around 9.20am and Faloshade hurriedly wheels the pram out onto the platform. Passengers pile in ahead of her until a man finally helps her board, only for her to realise that she’s on a carriage with no area for pushchairs. She hastily gets back off and rushes to embark on the next carriage.“I couldn’t believe it when I saw the letter. I was pregnant,” says the 35-year-old, still out of breath and sitting on a\u0026nbspfold-out seat\u0026nbspso she can tend to Shekinah. “I said OK, I will go. But every time I think about it, I feel stressed. I was afraid – why Manchester?”Faloshade gazes out of the window as the train rolls northwards, checking the time at regular intervals. “I worry about getting there,” she says. “I don’t want to be stressed. I just want to sign and come back. Going to another place to sign makes you worried, you don’t know what’s going to happen. And the letter I saw said that I could be denied\u0026nbspor I could be detained.”The Home Office has the power to detain people while they are signing on at reporting centres, and regularly does so with no warning. The Independent has reported on numerous cases whereby parents of young children have been detained in this way – sometimes leading to their children being taken into care.Once in Manchester station, Faloshade asks a member of staff how to get to Dallas Court and is waved in the direction of the trams. A man working at the tram stop tells her to get off at Salford Quays, and charges her for a £3.20 return ticket – taking another chunk out of her weekly funds.On arriving at Salford Quays it becomes clear that the man’s instructions were wrong. Google Maps shows that Dallas Court is several stops further. “If I was on my own, I don’t know how I would do this,” says Faloshade, bent over her pram as she feeds Shekinah on the tram platform. “I don’t have internet on my phone. And imagine what it’s like for people who don’t speak English.”Faloshade arrives at Dallas Court just before 11am\u0026nbspto find a queue outside. She files to the back but a Somali man close to the front of the line kindly beckons her to stand in front of him because she has a baby.The atmosphere outside the reporting centre is sombre. Nobody speaks. Everyone clutches their papers nervously, in the knowledge that, as their documents state, the Home Office can detain them at that moment. People coming out say they waited inside for a long time – some more than two hours.Some of those reporting live locally and were able to walk, but the majority have had to take at least one bus, with the average distance travelled around an hour. Despite claims by the Home Office that they reimburse people’s travel costs, several people in the queue say they haven’t yet received any money back from the last time they reported.“I had to take three buses to get here,” says one man, who didn’t want to be named. “Last time I was told the Home Office would reimburse me, but a month later I’ve received nothing.”When Faloshade reaches the front of the queue, the officer on the door looks at the journalist\u0026nbspstanding with her and says something to the officers inside. She is taken straight to a counter to sign on, and re-emerges within 15 minutes clutching her immigration papers, and smiling for the first time that day.\u0026nbsp“I thought I was going to take two hours,” she says, relieved. “A girl was in front of me said she had been coming every two weeks and said it normally took two hours. But they said they would attend to me quickly, because they thought I had a lawyer here.”The 35-year-old holds up\u0026nbspa bus travel card dated 11 July which is her next reporting date, but she has been given no reimbursement for today’s travel nor money for the train she will have to take to get to her appointment in six months’ time. All she can think about, though, is making the long journey home.“I feel relieved now. I was very lucky. I can go home in time to pick up my daughter,” says Faloshade, wheeling the pushchair away from the reporting centre. She leaves behind many others who, not so fortunate as to be accompanied by\u0026nbspa legal representative or journalist,\u0026nbspare likely to be waiting in the cold for a lot longer.Asylum and ImmigrationOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It is just beyond belief.”Mr Saberi also\u0026nbspsaid that his parents had a strong emotional bond with their grandson and that could have a detrimental effect on him if they have to leave the country.John Vassiliou, partner at McGill \u0026amp Co which is handling the case, said: “Mr Saberi is in his 80s, his wife is in her 70s. If they go back to Iran it’s difficult for British citizens to visit Iran, they can’t just fly over as if they were going to Spain or France.”“They are showing lots of signs of old age physically and mentally and they just want to be with their family,” he added.“If they go back to Iran they will be two old people living alone whereas here they are living in Edinburgh with all their family around them.”A Home Office spokesman said: “All UK visa applications are considered on their inidual merits, on the basis of the evidence available and in line with UK immigration rules.”Ian Murray, Labour MP for Edinburgh South, has voiced his support for the family.He tweeted: “I’m working with the family \u0026amp their lawyers to try \u0026amp persuade the Home Secretary to do the decent thing.”“This is our family,” she wrote.“We depend on them and they depend on us.

And it is one we will keep.”For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the

we will go for a people’s vote.”And Tom Watson, Labour’s deputy leader, speaking at the same conference, told a questioner urging quicker support for a referendum: “I am tempted to go there with you.”May to face Lords ambush that would scupper her Brexit trade plansThe calls came after Mr Corbyn angered some Final Say supporters by saying Labour would only consider backing a new referendum if the UK was on the brink of the “disaster of no deal”.They suspect him of planning to table repeat votes of no confidence\u0026nbspto try and\u0026nbsptrigger an election\u0026nbspas a device to avoid ever grasping the nettle of a further public vote.Speaking to The Independent after his speech, Sir Keir declined to set a deadline for the dramatic policy shift, with events in parliament over the next two weeks impossible to predict.But he said: “I am deeply conscious that there are only 69 days to go before the 29 March, therefore the window now is quite short.”Sir Keir also vowed the decision would not be taken by a closed circle, saying: “It is very important that, firstly, we hear what everybody has to say and, secondly, that we do it in a united way.”Created with Sketch.Brexit

but it cannot pass the Commons without the support of Labour’s leadership.Ms May appears to have abandoned attempts to find a cross-party consensus, ruling out any significant changes to her deal ahead of Monday’s statement.What would happen if a second referendum delivered another Leave vote?In a bizarre turn of events, May could now get her Brexit deal throughTory MPs turn on May over threat to scrap Human Rights ActMay must give ministers free votes on all Brexit options, says MajorInstead, she spent Friday meeting cabinet ministers – which only underlined the deep split between those urging compromise and those warning the Tory party will implode if she makes concessions.On Saturday, Sir Keir told a conference there were only “two remaining options”, the first being the government accepting a “close economic relationship with the EU”, as Labour proposed.“Secondly, as our conference motion sets out, the option of a public vote,” he said.He added: “I know there is significant support for this in our membership, in many trade unions, among a number of Labour MPs... this has to be an option for Labour.”Mr Watson added, on a second referendum: “That might be the only way that the insurance policy part of our conference resolution can help break the impasse in those Brexit negotiations.”But Ms Thornberry warned that, if Labour ended up backing a public vote, it must not repeat the “dreadful mistakes of the Remain campaign”.Earlier, John Major urged Theresa May to give her ministers free votes on all the Brexit options, along with other MPs, and relegate herself to being a “mediator” to solve the crisis.The Commons had “killed” her deal and she must recognise that attempts to revive it with minor “tinkering” – while sticking to her strict “red lines”\u0026nbsp– were doomed to failure.Calling for a radical “act of statesmanship”, the former Conservative prime minister said: “All party leaders would permit a free vote so we can get an honest representation of parliament.“And that is in the prime minister’s interest for this reason – it’s the only way to get an absolutely honest answer from members of parliament.”Sir John added:\u0026nbsp“If cabinet can’t agree and parliament can’t agree, the only option is a second referendum.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our

A second referendum would ask a different question to that posed\u0026nbspin the 2016 vote, and the outcome would thus almost certainly be much clearer and more straightforward for the government to implement.Johnson claims he ‘didn’t say anything’ about Turkey during BrexitThe sort of referendum being proposed by advocates\u0026nbspof a “people’s vote”\u0026nbspwould be likely see voters asked to choose between very specific outcomes,\u0026nbsprather than a simple expression of will\u0026nbsplike the 2016 vote, which asked\u0026nbspsimply whether or not the public wanted the UK to\u0026nbspleave the EU. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspInstead of just asking voters if they wanted to leave the EU, it\u0026nbspwould probably present them with two possible\u0026nbspways of doing so, along with the option of remaining in the bloc.While there is much debate about the exact question that should be asked,\u0026nbspa second referendum would probably give voters the choice between leaving the EU on the terms of the deal agreed by the government, leaving with no deal at all, or overturning the result of the 2016 vote and agreeing to stay in the EU.Created with Sketch.Brexit deal vote: Opposing groups of protesters gather by Parliament Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.An anti-Brexit protester adjusts her pro-EU wig A message to Jeremy Corbyn in support of a people\u0027s voteA mock Titanic captained by Theresa May heads towards an iceberg in a stunt by campaigning group AvaazProtesters of opposing sides are in close contact outside of ParliamentPaintings of Theresa May and Jeremy CorbynFormer UKIP leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester in Parliament SquareOpposing protesters share the space outside ParliamentAnti-Brexit protesters stand on Westminster Bridge ahead of today\u0027s vote Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outiside ParliamentAnti-Brexit protesters demonstrate outside the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester sets up outside ParliamentAn anti-Brexit protester waves an EU flag on Westminster Bridge ahead of today\u0027s vote Protesters of opposing sides demonstrate outside ParliamentProtesters of opposing sides stand near ParliamentAn anti-Brexit protester adjusts her pro-EU wig A message to Jeremy Corbyn in support of a people\u0027s voteA mock Titanic captained by Theresa May heads towards an iceberg in a stunt by campaigning group AvaazProtesters of opposing sides are in close contact outside of ParliamentPaintings of Theresa May and Jeremy CorbynFormer UKIP leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester in Parliament SquareOpposing protesters share the space outside ParliamentAnti-Brexit protesters stand on Westminster Bridge ahead of today\u0027s vote Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outiside ParliamentAnti-Brexit protesters demonstrate outside the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester sets up outside ParliamentAn anti-Brexit protester waves an EU flag on Westminster Bridge ahead of today\u0027s vote Protesters of opposing sides demonstrate outside ParliamentProtesters of opposing sides stand near ParliamentIf people\u0026nbspagain voted to leave, there would be no need for further negotiations: either the UK would simply leave the EU in line with the deal already agreed with Brussels, or it would crash out without an agreement. The public would have given the government a mandate not just for leaving the EU, but also for how they wanted to do so.If, on the other hand, voters decided to back Remain, the government could simply revoke Article 50, as European courts have ruled it has the right to do, and that would be it: Britain would stay in the EU.The intention of a\u0026nbspsecond referendum would thus be to give a clear instruction as to the specifc course of action that the public wanted the government to take. That is why a growing number of MPs believe it is the best way to break the deadlock in parliament.They say that, while the first referendum gave the government a mandate to negotiate the terms of Britain’s withdrawal from the EU, a\u0026nbspsecond\u0026nbspwould allow voters to decide whether or not they wanted\u0026nbspto go ahead with that decision, knowing much more about what it would mean, and if so on what terms.Got an unanswered question about Brexit?

An exclusive survey for The Independent shows that a fresh vote received more support than any of the\u0026nbspfour other options put to the public, including allowing\u0026nbspthe prime minister to go back to Brussels\u0026nbspor a\u0026nbspno-deal Brexit.The survey by poling organisation BMG Research also suggests that more people oppose\u0026nbspMs May’s deal than back it, although the prime minister can take some comfort in the data showing a softening of opposition.

It found 28 per cent were against and 26 per cent did not know.Remaining in the EU was backed by 45 per cent, while 39 per cent of people said they\u0026nbspopposed reversing Brexit and 16 per cent said they did not know.Forty-five per cent supported further negotiation with the EU, while 34 per cent were against going back to Brussels for fresh talks. More than a fifth (21 per cent) did not know.Some 40 per cent would opt for Norway-style deal – which allows access to the single market – but 36 per cent dismissed the option and 24 per cent were unsure.Leaving the EU without a deal was the least popular option as it was preferred by only 35 per cent, while 45 per cent opposed it and 21 per cent said they did not know.It comes as\u0026nbspthe prime minister has been reaching out to Labour MPs and trade unions in a last-ditch bid to get her deal\u0026nbspthrough parliament.Government insiders are expecting Brussels\u0026nbspto offer\u0026nbspMs May some extra help by Monday, which they hope will ease fears from wavering MPs over\u0026nbspthe\u0026nbspIrish backstop.However, she is unlikely to secure a legally binding guarantee that the UK can independently decide to the leave the backstop, which Brexiteers and her\u0026nbspDUP allies want.BBC analysis estimates Ms May could lose the meaningful vote by\u0026nbsp228 votes next week, after which she would have to come back to parliament within three days with a plan B.Northern Ireland secretary ‘using peace process as bargaining tool’What is the position of the big trade unions on Brexit?The truth about May’s shambolic approach to the unionsFinally, May has realised she desperately needs Labour’s backingArticle 50 set to be extended even if May wins crucial Brexit voteOpposition to Ms May’s deal\u0026nbsphas weakened among the public, as the BMG research shows 37 per cent think\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbspshould reject the deal, compared with 43 per cent in December.When asked if parliament should vote to accept the terms of the deal, 29 per cent said they should, up from 26 per cent last month. More than 30 per cent said they were unsure in both instances.The poll put Labour and the Conservatives\u0026nbspneck and neck on 36 per cent of the vote,\u0026nbspwith the\u0026nbspLiberal Democrats on 12 points,\u0026nbspUkip\u0026nbspon 6 per cent and the Greens on 5 points, once don’t-knows were excluded.The Independent\u0026nbsprevealed on Friday that Ms May’s\u0026nbspchances of delivering\u0026nbspBrexit\u0026nbspon 29 March are fading fast after senior ministers privately admitted more time is needed, even if her deal wins the backing of parliament.On Saturday, transport secretary Chris Grayling was accused of engaging in “gutter politics” when he warned that blocking Brexit could lead to a surge in far-right extremism.Created with Sketch.

The long answer is a bit more complicated, but is still \u0026nbsp“no”.Turkey is officially a candidate country to join the EU – so you might be forgiven for thinking it is likely to join the EU.The twist is that it has been a candidate country since 1999, and since then more than a dozen other countries have joined while Turkey has not.In reality, Turkey’s application has made no progress for years, and has been officially frozen for some time – most recently again in November 2016Why are talks stalled or frozen?Turkey is widely perceived to have taken a turn for the authoritarian in recent years under President Recep Erdoğan. As such it does not meet the conditions of membership on human rights grounds. Observers say Turkey is, if anything, moving backwards on the conditions, and that doesn’t look like it will change any time soon.On paper Erdoğan is still committed to joining the EU, but the accession process is very formal and Turkey has made little progress in meeting milestones set by the bloc. \u0026nbspAdditionally, many EU states have similar fears and prejudices to the ones Vote Leave tried to play on in the UK during the EU referendum – the underlying message of which is that a large, mostly Muslim country should not be admitted to the union.Created with Sketch.

A teddy bear slumps across his load. He tells me that the cuddly toy is his pillow. I imagine him taking it to bed, not to cuddle beneath the covers, but to use as a buffer, a protective layer between his body and cold concreteThe neat repetition of vivid colours and the clear leading lines in this photograph contrast with the instability and blurred boundaries of its political content. Brighton is known for its green politics, but for some that’s not enough: one must go further than being conscious of the environment, and live in a way that sees all species as equalSince residents began displaying political messages in their windows, making the private realm public, this high-rise has become a local attraction. The full sign reads ‘BLOCK BREXIT’. But I wanted to show it from a different angle and gain another perspective, to alter its meaning, to treat reality as something unfixed and malleableThe nickname is misspelt, but Pompey is alive and smiling, up and about like the stranger who had rested on the bench by the sea. Only the sleeping bag is left as a sign of what might have beenAngela Merkel and other leaders have specifically said they would veto Turkey’s membership. This situation appears unlikely to change for the foreseeable future.\u0026nbspBut doesn’t the UK support Turkey’s membership?\u0026nbspOfficially, it does. This is because in some respects, Turkish membership\u0026nbspis aligned with the UK’s long-term strategic goals.Benefits include: keeping a large country with an eastern border in the Middle East aligned with western values and norms, and using Turkey’s perceived support for looser economic integration as a brake on the federal ambitions of other member states.Turkey is also seen as a valuable intelligence partner\u0026nbspin an unstable region where the British state sees itself as having strategic interests.It’s for these reasons that David Cameron repeatedly said the UK supported\u0026nbspTurkey’s membership – even though antipathy towards immigration was probably higher on most people’s minds.Are any other countries going to join the EU?Yes, that’s on the cards – though they’re mostly smaller. The next states on their way to join the EU are the western Balkans – places like Serbia, Bosnia, Macedonia, Montenegro, Kosovo and Albania. \u0026nbspSome tentative steps have been taken\u0026nbspto integrating these countries, but they do have some way to go before they can join. Most do not yet meet conditions\u0026nbspon rule of law, economic, and human rights grounds.They are also all fairly small and could be easily absorbed by the bloc: the EU likes to think it has learned from its previous rapid expansion eastwards, which led to immigration causing disquiet in some member states. Other problems with rule of law in recent joiners such as Hungary and Poland have also caused the EU to be more cautious about accepting new members.\u0026nbspOf the western Balkans, Serbia and Montenegro are both candidate countries who have begun negotiating. Macedonia and Albania are candidates but have not started negotiating, while Bosnia has applied. Kosovo’s sovereign status is disputed but it is a seen as a potential candidate.Got an unanswered question about Brexit?

He is happy to hang around with Stalinists and anti-Semites, Holocaust deniers and apologists for terrorism. But he won’t talk to the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.The Labour leader’s refusal to discuss Brexit with his Tory — and come to that, Lib Dem, SNP, DUP and Plaid Cymru — counterparts reveals the utter smallness of the man.For two years, Jezza has been noisily demanding that Theresa May “reach out” to other parties. Yet the moment she does, he comes over all snooty and stand-offish.He won’t join any discussions about our EU policy unless and until the PM pledges that we won’t leave without a deal.That condition is absurd. Mrs May, as Corbyn well knows, is also keen to avoid No Deal. But the only way to avoid that is to agree on, you know, a deal.That’s precisely why the PM is talking to the other party leaders.The only effect of publicly ruling out No Deal — as several MPs in all parties have been pompously doing — is to encourage Brussels to dig in and thus, paradoxically, to make No Deal more likely.What explains Jezza’s sudden coolness  Is it simple tribalism of the sort that has now taken over the top ranks of Labour Immediately before the vote, for example, Richard Burgon, the Corbynite Shadow Justice Secretary, repeatedly described Conservatives on TV as “the real enemy”.After the confidence motion, another Labour MP, Danielle Rowley, posted a picture of the Conservative benches with the caption, “People are dying because of these people”.Is Corbs unwilling to talk to Tories because he sees them as evil murderers I don’t think so. Part of the old booby’s schtick is that he will talk to anyone. It’s how he justies his meetings with Irish Republicans and jihadi extremists.It’s how he justies taking money to appear on a TV station backed by the ayatollahs in Tehran.He has even said that he would be prepared to negotiate with the head-hackers of IS in order to facilitate peace.I don’t think so. Part of the old booby’s schtick is that he will talk to anyone. It’s how he justies his meetings with Irish Republicans and jihadi extremists.It’s how he justies taking money to appear on a TV station backed by the ayatollahs in Tehran.He has even said that he would be prepared to negotiate with the head-hackers of IS in order to facilitate peace.No, there is a much simpler explanation for why he won’t talk to the PM. It would force him to take a public position on Brexit. And that is the last thing he wants to do.Corbyn is an Old Left Eurosceptic. He took what was, effectively, the Moscow line during the Cold War, namely that the EEC was the economic arm of Nato.He disliked what he saw as its capitalism, and knows he will be able to implement a far more radical form of socialism once Britain is no longer constrained by EU rules on competition and state aid.He also knows that the overwhelming majority of Labour MPs want to stay in the EU.During the referendum campaign, he reluctantly went along with his party, though he made little secret of his distaste.Although we’ll never know for sure, I have a strong suspicion, looking at his face as he left the polling station, that he secretly voted Leave.Be that as it may, he has since kept the Labour coalition together by attacking the Government while saying nothing about what he would do.That ambiguity has allowed him to appease his party without alienating the millions in Labour’s northern heartlands who voted Leave.From a self-interest point of view, it made sense. But the impact on Britain’s negotiating position was dire.Labour’s tactic has been to demand impossible conditions from the Government. As Barry Gardiner, the Shadow Trade Minister, was overheard saying in Brussels: “It’s bollocks — always has been bollocks.”The trouble is, that by adopting its testicular conditions, Labour has ended up arguing for something that would represent the worst of all worlds.The main stated dference between the two parties is over the customs union. Labour says it wants Brussels to control Britain’s trade policy in perpetuity after we leave.As recently as last year, Corbyn was against the customs union on the unarguable grounds that “It is protectionist against third- world countries”.That was the reason successive Labour Eurosceptics, as far back as Clement Attlee, opposed joining the EEC.But last February, spotting an opportunity to vote against the Government without having to commit to anything, Labour somersaulted and started demanding customs union membership.Be clear: Being outside the EU but inside its customs union would be disastrous. It would keep the costs of membership without the benefits of leaving.As former Canadian PM Stephen Harper, a massive Anglophile and a Remain supporter in , put it recently: “It is really critical that this country rediscovers itself as a trading nation. If you do not do that, then frankly the Brexit experience will be bad.” When I put that point to another member of the shadow cabinet in a BBC green room, he looked at me asI was mad. We’re this close to the first truly socialist government in Britain,” he told me. “You really think we care about the customs union either way ”Yet it is precisely that cynicism that voters are turning against. People are furious at the game-playing in Westminster. They accept that MPs have dfering views, but they can tell when a party is advancing bogus arguments for purely selfish reasons.In the last analysis, Jeremy Corbyn has shown himself to be unwilling to work in what he himself sees as the national interest. That is what makes him unfit for office.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

What a powerful statement.This school’s success is rooted in a couple of factors. It has a dedicated “study centre” open from am until pm.The centre was opened after the school realised that some of their students who live in busy or chaotic households don’t have access to a quiet study space.Role models are emphasised within the school, which has created a “university access team” featuring five full-time members of staff who are all Oxbridge graduates.Quite apart from the academic challenges — the privilege and elitism surrounding the world of Oxbridge is so intimidating that even the brightest kids coming from ordinary households could easily conclude that they wouldn’t belong.So the university access team also help them to see Oxbridge as an achievable goalThey take students to museums and find other ways to get them excited about study.Their sole aim is to support potential candidates, from  upwards, to get into good universities. I often say you can’t help where you start but you can decide where you end up.And this is a brilliant example.This kind of success comes down largely to self-belief.These children have been encouraged to visualise a very bright future for themselves, and to believe that they are worthy of it. And with that powering you, the sky really is the limit.Which is why the story about a young woman called Liv Conlon, from Bothwell near Glasgow, also caught my eye.Liv set up her first business at , importing goods from China and selling them online.She used the money she made from that to start another company, called The Property Stagers, which furnishes empty homes and, after years of bullying, decided to leave school at  to run it full time.Liv is now . The company furnishes more than  properties a year, and she’s hired a team of ten people – including her mother and brother.She’s also bought and renovated her own one-bedroom flat — all without the help from the Bank of Mum and Dad.She believes being bullied every day at school for four years made her set on being a success.“It made me more determined. Everyone who’s ever doubted my ability or capability or challenged that just put a fire in my stomach to go on and be better.”An outstanding attitude and what a role model Liv is.Nothing is more powerful than feeling irrepressible and the desire to cock a snook at the people who don’t want you to achieve.Both these stories prove the same point: If you believe in yourself – and you are prepared to work hard – there is no limit to what you can do.Yes, you need a bit of luck. But in my experience the harder you work, the luckier you get.DJ Sara Cox said this week she has to “work at friendship” as she gets older, words that really resonated for me.When you are young friendships are the backbone of your le and feel effortless.But things change.Andyou aren’t careful you get boring.I’m shocked at how easy it can be to reach a point where you don’t want to go out or do anything in your spare time.But you know what  It’s so important to force yourself off the sofa every so often and have a laugh with your girlfriends. I just need to get Dry January out of the way first.No wonder some envious people have been making mean comments.Meghan has glided through the past few months with real dignity, while also looking a milllion dollars.She is positively glowing. . .  something I never quite managed during pregnancy, despite all the promises.MY heart went out this week to Andy Murray, and the despair he so clearly feels that his body is letting him down and ending his career.It’s a reminder that the toughest part of the job for sports stars is the end. And the higher you’ve flown, the bigger the fall.I had a glimpse of how it feels ten years ago when I sold my business and had a bit of a . . . lull, before the next thing happened.During that time, I’d phone people up and when the receptionist asked me where I was calling from, my answer was, “Um, my living room.”For the first time in my le I wasn’t being defined by my business or my job title.The same will surely be true for Andy when he can no longer say that he is an international tennis player.The dficulty for professional sportspeople on retiring is that, suddenly, everything you have been geared up towards and focusing on is not there any more. There is nothing so harsh as the realisation that you are no longer relevant.I’ve seen this happen to a lot of footballers.One day you are a revered player for a Premier League club where everything is done for you. The next you are on your own, trying to make your way in a not-always-friendly world.In my view, people who cope are those who look forward not back. They look at what is happening in the next chapter, rather than who they once were.Take John McEnroe who is a hugely successful TV pundit and author. He has capitalised on his success – and shared it. And I have a feeling that, when the pain subsides, Andy Murray will do the same.HAS anyone  noticed how many news stories at the moment seem to be about people carrying and using a machete Why on earth would anyone need to carry a machete in England  We don’t live in a jungle, although it might feel like it at times.The only way to stop this epidemic is to pass a law prohibiting the ownership of this type of weapon.Anyone selling them on the internet for dispatch to this country needs to be issued with a UK arrest warrant and prosecuted.NOT quite sure what is motivating everyone to take part in the so-called “Ten-Year Challenge” – where you upload a photo of yourself from ten years ago to social media, together with a recent one, we’ve mocked one up for Adele.The only possible reason to do this, as far as I can see, is to say: “Haven’t I aged well ”I like a challenge . . . but this one’s not for me.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

First, a mechanism so we can exit from the backstop — an interim regime of rules.Otherwise we risk being stuck in an indefinite limbo of laws, with no UK say over them.Second, we want a future relationship based on a free trade agreement so we are free to strike deals with other countries, from Latin America to Asia, to create jobs and cut prices in UK shops.If the EU won’t budge, we should keep our pledge to leave on WTO terms. That way, we can mitigate the risks of some short-term disruption.Dissident MPs are firing blanks. The Norway option means more concessions, including giving up UK control over immigration.A second referendum would create more uncertainty, the last thing business wants, and trigger a backlash from the majority who would feel cheated by the rejection of the  result.

Is the planned Festival of Brexit Britain still going ahead  And,so, will enough tickets be sold to hold it in David Cameron’s shepherd’s hut  When Theresa May promised a “strong and stable Government” did she mean the stench of horse dung that left her mouth would be so strong her Cabinet would end up as stable hands, spending all their time cleaning up her steaming piles of cack  And how will we explain to future generations exactly how the Mother Of All Parliaments became the Mother-In-Law of all Jokes. There are many reasons, of course, but let’s focus on arguably the biggest one. How millions of ordinary people, clobbered by austerity, believed wealthy liars when they told them all their problems were down to an aloof ruling elite. An elite, naturally, that these millionaire, public-school-educated, Tory-supporting, ex-City bankers were shydefinitely not a part of. And you only need look at the past few days to see what a blatant, brutal trick was played by these Men of the People. Take Nigel Farage. A year ago he complained about being “skint” as “there’s no money in shypolitics”. That’s despite living in a poundmillion Cha shytownhouse, taking home an MEP’s poundk-a-year salary and being in line for a poundk-a-year pension. This week he was forced to admit he’d taken a private jet from media duties in London to hisworkplace in shyStrasbourg, allowing a reporter to point out that “You cannot rant against the elite when you behave like one of its members”. When asked how much the jet had cost, he said, dismissively, that he couldn’t remember. Clearly too pfling an amount to trouble the poor “skint” sod’s memory. Then there was that great patriot, Jacob Rees-Mogg, who marked the inflicting of the biggest Commons defeat in British parliamentary history on his own Prime Minister, by inviting his chums back to his six-bedroom, grade-II listed, poundmillion townhouse, for a champagne party to toast her humiliation.  Ex-Brexit Secretary David Davis and former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson were among more than  “anti-elitist” MPs greeted with a flute of the finest bubbles at the door, shyprobably by a fleet of nannies. I wonder how many of the ordinary voters they pretend to be battling theshy shyEstablishment for were at the bash  Apart from delivery drivers who dropped off the canapes and cleaners who threw out the empties. Rees-Mogg is a very rich man whose we’s ancestral pile, the -room Wentworth Woodhouse, is the UK’s largest private house. Yet he dismisses those who call for a second referendum thus: “It’s not about the people. It’s about those who think they should be in charge. It’s about the elite.” Sadly, most of the people who fell for the lies about wanting Brexit for the little guy when these phoneys want it solely for their own advancement and enrichment, still believe them. Just as many working-class folk in America still refuse to admit that the billionaire scam-artist they elected on a promise of draining the Washington pond is the most power-crazed sleazebag of them all. I’m sure future generations will agree that this elitist lie was the most dangerous political deception of modern times.

The Prime Minister is due to outline her latest EU withdrawal plan when she updates the Commons on Monday. She will reportedly outline plans for an attempt to turn the Irish backstop, opposed by Brexiteers, into a standalone treaty with Ireland. Mrs May will table a neutral motion - which is expected to attract a flurry of amendments from MPs - which will be debated and voted on on January . Some Remain-supporting MPs are expected to try and seize control of the parliamentary agenda to thwart a no-deal departure.   One group led by Tory former minister Nick Boles and the senior Labour MP Yvette Cooper is attempting to block a no-deal Brexit - something Mrs May strongly opposes. However The Sunday Times reported that a second group led by the former attorney general Dominic Grieve wants to go further and suspend the Article  withdrawal process Pro-Brexit International Trade Secretary Liam Fox warned of a political tsunamithe Government fails to deliver on the  referendum vote. Downing Street described the moves as extremely concerning and said they underlined the need for MPs who supported Brexit to vote for it in the House. A No  spokeswoman said: Any attempt to remove the Governments power to meet the legal conditions of an orderly exit at this moment of historic signicance is extremely concerning. Meanwhile, Commons Speaker John Bercow could scrap plans to quit this summer after Cabinet Ministers threatened to deny him a peerage over of his alleged Remain bias, it was claimed. The reports comes as Mrs May prepares to brief Cabinet ministers on her talks with other party leaders and senior MPs following the crushing defeat of her Brexit deal last week in the Commons. The Sunday Times said it had obtained leaked emails showing that Mr Grieve had been in secret communication with a Commons clerk of bills Colin Lee to discuss how it could be possible suspend Article .   In one email sent on Wednesday, Mr Lee was said to have made clear that the aim of the plan was to delay Brexit. What follows is just for you and you will understand the terms, he said. We have been thinking that legislation is needed, but it occurs to me the substantive motion, say calling for Article  extension, could be made. In a statement, a House of Commons spokesman said: It is common practice for clerks to provide advice to Members on the drafting of many items of parliamentary business, such as bills, motions and amendments. This advice is provided on a rigorously impartial basis. We do not comment on inidual cases. Mrs May is due to make a statement to MPs on Monday setting out how she intends to proceed with Brexit after the tumultuous events of last week. She will also table a neutral motion - which is expected to attract a flurry of amendments from MPs - which will be debated and voted on on January .   With feelings running high, the pro-Brexit International Trade Secretary Liam Fox warned of a political tsunamithe Government fails to deliver on the  referendum vote. He also hit out at ministers calling for Mrs May to rule out a no-deal Brexit, saying the most stupid thing possible in a negotiation is to give away your strongest card. Writing in The Sunday , Dr Fox said: Failure to deliver Brexit would produce a yawning gap between Parliament and the people, a schism in our political system with unknowable consequences. The reaction of the Question Time audience could become a political tsunami. It is time for MPs to deliver on the promises they made. It is a matter of honour and a matter of duty. In a letter to the ,  Tory association chairmen and other senior grassroots figures said the partys  manesto stated no deal was better than a bad deal, and failing to honour that pledge would be a breach of trust with with voters and party members. Meanwhile Commons Speaker John Bercow, was said to be considering abandoning his plans to step down this summer after Cabinet ministers threatened to deny him a peerage because of his alleged bias against the Government over Brexit. The Observer reported that friends of Mr Bercow who have been in contact with him recently said he was now seriously reflecting on whether to stay on - possibly until .

As Cervical Cancer Prevention week starts on Monday, three women tell their story – and explain why getting screened early could save your le.How could I look my kids in the eyeI refused a test  Laura,   When Laura Flaherty received the letter saying her smear test was due, she felt that familiar dread. “I was a mum of two with a full-time job and it was the run-up to Christmas,” she recalls. “I thought, ‘I don’t have time for this’ and kept putting it off.”After several reminders, Laura finally went for a test and, then aged , was diagnosed with cervical cancer in June .She recalls: “When the doctor said the words, I completely broke down. “I begged him to save me. I said, ‘I’ve got two small children at home, they aren’t going to remember methey lose me’. I was utterly devastated.”Already mum to Violet, now four, and Alex, eight, Laura and her partner Ryan made the tough decision for her to have a hysterectomy. “I was convinced I was going to die in the operating theatre,” says Laura. “I wrote letters to the kids, to say goodbye.” Thankfully she survived, and got the all-clear in August . Now she campaigns to raise cancer awareness. Laura, an aquarium worker from Leigh, Gtr Manchester, adds: “I watched Jade Goody on Big Brother and loved her. What happened to her was tragic and it is preventable.“If I kept putting off my smear, my cancer would have killed me – how could I ever have looked my children in the eye and told them I was dying ”  I put off trip to the doc but it pays to get checked Hayley,   It was Jade Goody’s death that convinced mum-of-three Hayley Prince to go for her smear test. She says: “My periods were really heavy and I had painful cramps, but had been putting off the test. I always liked Jade and when she died it prompted me to go to my appointment.” Hayley – a focused care practitioner – was diagnosed with cervical cancer on May , two months after Jade died.Terried Hayley, mum to Nathan, , Joe, , and Ben, , says: “Jade died, so I thought I was going to die. It scared the living daylights out of me. I went to bits.”Hayley had a hysterectomy in July , then six weeks of radiotherapy and chemotherapy as the cancer had spread to her lymph nodes. “It was awful,” she says. “After the hysterectomy, I no longer felt like a woman. Then the chemo knocked me off my feet.” After a dficult recovery Hayley, from Stockport, Gtr Manchester, got the all-clear in January . She recalls: “I threw a party to celebrate with  friends and family members all delighted that I’d beaten cancer. Living with a cancer diagnosis feels like a le sentence. “With cervical cancer, it really is preventable. It is so, so important to get your smear test done on time.”I came through the tears and trauma and so can you Sophie,   Young, active, fit, happy and engaged to be married, the last thing on Sophie Wheeldon’s mind was cervical cancer – until she was diagnosed in November , aged just . “It was a total shock,” says the MS manager. “As soon as you hear the word cancer, you feel like your le is over. I remember thinking, ‘Surely this can’t be right. I’m , I’m far too young to get ill’.” Sophie, from Buxton, Derbys, had no symptoms and was diagnosed following her routine smear test. Once the devastating news had sunk in, she faced the heartbreaking decision of whether to have a hysterectomy – and end her dream of having kids – or choose a trachelectomy, which leaves the womb and oies in tact. “My wonderful partner Alex and I always wanted kids, so the thought of that dream ending killed me,” Sophie says. She opted to have the trachelectomy. Her recovery was slow and dficult and she remembers days when she would “stand in the shower and cry”. But two years on, Sophie is free of cancer. She married IT specialist Alex in June last year and the pair are now trying for a baby. She adds: “I’m happy, healthy and planning my future – my smear test saved my le. It could save yours too.” Most types of cervical cancer are caused by high-risk strains of the HPV virus. Attending your scheduled smear test means doctors can detect any cell changes early and prevent cancer forming. Not all women diagnosed with cervical cancer have symptoms. But look out for unusual bleeding during or after sex or between periods, pain during sex and pain in the pelvis, bleeding after the menopause and changes to vaginal discharge.

It might be possible to buy a house in the country for as little as pound, - the price of a brand new family car.However, buyers can expect to shell out for renovation work and have to compromise on space, Wales Online reports. Still, after some work, they could see the value of their bargain homes increase signicantly. Here are some of the cheapest homes available on the market:Abercwmboi: pound,What: Located on the side of a mountain overlooking the pretty Cynon Valley, this house is a residential village on the way to Aberdare.It has one reception room, a kitchen and a bathroom on the ground floor, and two bedrooms and a bathroom on the first floor too.How: The terrace is going under the hammer with Paul Fosh Auctions for a guide price of pound, on Thursday, February  at pm at The Park Inn Hotel, Llanedeyrn, Cardf.Swansea: pound,   What: For the price of a brand new family car, it might be possible to purchase this house at the end of a terrace within walking distance of Swansea city centre.It has an open-plan reception room and kitchen downstairs and two bedrooms and a family bathroom upstairs. But, as the auction guide price suggests, there are a few challenges to overcome. Its no surprise that it needs a clear-out and a complete refurbishment but it can only be bought by a cash buyer as it only has a lease of approximately  years. Butyou have the cash, including a budget to purchase or extend the lease, then this might be tidy investment.  How: The house goes to auction with Dawsons on Wednesday, February  at pm at the Marriott Hotel in Swansea Marina.Near Narbeth: pound,+   What: Firstly, theres no guarantee that the redundant Horeb Chapel will sell for near its guide price, it could go for far more.Secondly,you do secure this cute Victorian chapel nestled in the Pembrokeshire countryside then theres a mountain of work ahead that could turn into renovation hell, so reading the legal pack before you bid is a must. According to the estate agent selling the chapel, there is evidence that bats have beaten you to it and are already living there. Plus there are currently five requests for future burials by former members of the chapel. And you have to help maintain the graveyard But,all the challenges are considered and tackled, this could be a unique future home in a pretty rural spot, surrounded by rolling Welsh countryside. It could be heaven.

Inside, it is not a typical auction lot as it has a kitchen and bathroom that can both be salvaged and save you money.  However, judging by the photos, there might be work to be done to sort out a damp issue, or at the very least a lick of paint.How: Bid for this at the next auction from Auction House South Wales, on Wednesday, February  at pm at the Village Hotel, Coryton, CardfAbertillery: pound,   What: Want this one  Youll have to be quick as the estate agent has already received an offer of pound, from another buyer and they want to seeanyone  out there wants to make an offer. But dont panic buy because its a bargain...The end of terrace house has two reception rooms and a kitchen downstairs and two bedrooms and a bathroom upstairs. But it might be dficult to secure a mortgage as the kitchen seems to have disappeared, so getting advice is essential before you go shopping in this property January sale.

The Broomloan Nursery in Govan, Glasgow, is fighting child poverty on the front-lines by supplying kids and their parents meals made up of handouts from Tesco and Greggs. Families in the area with children as young as three are unable to afford food.And while Brexit continues to dominate the national headlines the crisis is flying under the radar of politicians, according to the Daily Record .  Dismayed at what is unfolding before her eyes, leader of the nursery, Maggie Frater, has decided to matters into her own hands. “I watched a mum at the Christmas party taking armfuls of sandwiches, Maggie said. “At first we thought she was being greedy, but I spoke with her and realised she was simply desperately hungry. “She hadn’t eaten properly for a few days and she was trying to fill up. “She was squirrelling some of the sandwiches away for her kids because she didn’t have enough to feed them.”   In nursery head Shona Pourvatans office, two pictures drawn by a child at the school help to encapsulate the crisis. In one, a woman can be seen crying with little  around her in the other a woman is smiling surrounded by shopping bags. The artist behind the powerful drawings was an African girl who is said to have no food at home. “She was from Eritrea and English wasn’t her first language,” explained Shona. “Her mum was crying in the picture because there was nothing to eat. You can see she’s drawn a tear-stained face. “But we had some vouchers we were able to offer and the following day, she did another drawing with a smiling face.” Poverty campaigners have praised the work of Broomloan but have condemned the system which requires places like the nursery to step up and fill the void created by ignorant politicians. By their own admission, Shona, Maggie and the rest of their team have established a series of services helping to tackle poverty in the area head-on.  Maggie coordinates a team to take food destined for the dump and transport it to the nursery instead. She also writes letters to business to source toys, clothes, toiletries and baby food for families in need. Broomloan’s incredible efforts – which include a laundry service, home visits and care parcels – are in response to the problems affecting families in the area. In addition, Maggie has crafted links with Tesco, Greggs and other businesses to set up a network of regular donations. “I make sure nothing gets wasted,” she said. “The table foes from full to empty quite quickly and that’s great. We have sandwiches, sausage rolls, stir-fry veg, tins of soup and baby food. “We put out sanitary products, toothpaste and deodorant too. I don’t want anyone to be embarrassed or ashamed. “We know what they need and I can help get it.”   Twice a week staff at the nursery travel to collect end-of-day stock that would otherwise be thrown away. Shoana said: Poverty is a huge issue. We have parents who tell us they are not eating or haven’t eaten for days because they don’t have enough to feed their kids and themselves. “We have introduced home visits for every child who gets registered here. It’s not about snooping on them. It means we can see parents and children in their home environment and the kids will see us as someone they trust.” The nursery have also started delivering care parcels to families outside of term time, to make sure they have all the necessary provisions year-round. Neil Cowan, of the Poverty Alliance, said: “In a society that believes in justice and compassion, it’s simply unjust that nurseries and schools are having to step in to respond to distressing levels of poverty in their communities. “We need to redesign our economy so that it works for everyone. Both the UK and Scottish Governments share a moral responsibility to ensure the social security system enables people to live a dignied le.”  A recent survey found that , of Scotland’s children are living in poverty, compared to , four years ago. The Scottish Government want to reduce that figure to  per cent by . Jim McCormick, of social policy research and development charity The Joseph Rowntree Foundation, said: “People have a strong sense that it’s not right for families to be stuck in poverty, and this is an example of the work people are doing every day to act on their compassion. “While forms of support like these and food banks are vital in the here and now, it is essential that we tackle the root causes of poverty.” Labour’s poverty and inequality spokeswoman Elaine Smith said the Broomloan schemes were “inspiring”. She added: “It shows how badly some families are struggling that the nursery has to take these sorts of steps, and why we need to see change across the country.

The man, who rented a cottage on the Norfolk estate until last year, claimed he had two near misses with the Duke of Edinburgh’s Land Rover Freelander. He told the Sunday Mirror, Philip had twice pulled out at junctions in front of him, causing him to slam on his brakes. On another occasion he had to drive on to the verge to get out of the Prince’s way.   The tenant, who asked not to be named, told us: “The man’s notorious, he drove around and you had to get out of the way. “On two occasions he pulled out from a side road. Once, he pulled out at a junction to my left – I had to steer right and step on the brakes. He just came out on a bend. On another occasion at crossroads he came straight across the junction. “He’s , with a range of medical complaints, and drives ashe’s the only one on the road. If you saw him, you’d get ready to get out of the way.” The claims were also reflected online. Sue Brown claimed: “Years ago, my uncle had a similar incident. It wasn’t until both drivers got out that my uncle realised he was shouting at the Prince.” And teaching assistant Charlotte Tuffnell, of Fakenham, said: “He nearly ran my dad off the road a few years back.” Businessman Patrick Daynes said he was left in a neck brace after the Duke ran into the back of his car at a zebra crossing in . “It was entirely his fault,” he said.   An excerpt from the  book ‘Duke of Edinburgh: A portrait by his valet’, John Dean revealed that shortly after Elizabeth II and Philip got engaged in , the future prince was involved in a nasty collision. Skidding off the road in Cirencester, Gloucestershire, Philip - who according to Dean was renown for his speed - struck a tree, before crashing through a fence. The Prince escaped relatively unscathed but was encouraged a number of people to give up driving, according to Dean. A newspaper clipping from the time described Philip as a keen motorist with a zest for speed which has even upset even the Royal chauffeurs, men with accident-free records who are now chary of driving with him.  On Thursday, Prince Phillip collided with a blue Kia carrying a -month-old child on board near the Queen’s Sandringham Estate in Norfolk. A passing driver, -year-old Victoria Warne - whose husband helped hoist the -year-old from the wreckage - says Philip asked “Is everyone alright ” Before adding, “I’m such a fool.” The Duke was treated in hospital on Friday morning, but is understood to have been “worrying about the others [involved in the crash]”  Mr Warne said: I saw the car flip and thought f*****g hell. Before I even stopped I said to Victoria, dial . I looked down and had the Prince’s blood on my hands. All I could think is, thank goodness there wasn’t more, the pensioner told The Sun. I had his blood on my hands. It wasn’t much and one of the royal people gave me a wipe.” The smash injured a grandmother and mum but the baby travelling in the Kia was unharmed. The duke retired from royal duties in August  and underwent a hip replacement in May last year, having completed some , solo engagements since . A Buckingham Palace statement read: The Duke of Edinburgh was involved in a road traffic accident with another vehicle this afternoon. The Duke was not injured. The accident took place close to the Sandringham Estate.” Norfolk Police said the incident would be investigated and any appropriate action taken.  Two days after the crash, the -year-old was photographed driving a brand-new Land Rover without a seatbelt. A Norfolk Constabulary spokeswoman said the force was aware of the photographs and that suitable words of advice have been given to the driver.

Two years ago it was reported that she was visiting the gym to hit the treadmill – embracing a “wellness” craze and attending yoga classes several times a week. Heeding warnings from doctors that she risks developing diabetes, she managed to lose a few pounds – which isn’t the only thing that changed about her look. Having taken a hairdressing and beauty therapy course, it was also claimed she cut her own hair in a short, feathered style, dyed dark brown. In  she was moved from Bronzefield prison in Ashford, Surrey, to top-security Low Newton, near Durham.  It was reported that shortly before the move, staff had discovered a plot to attack her. Five balls had been stolen from the pool table – to be placed, it was feared, in a sock or stocking which would then be used to bludgeon West.

According to sources in the jail, West likes to see herself as the prison matriarch. But the horror of her prolic killing spree still casts a shadow over the families of the victims – whose lives have been shattered by her and warped husband Fred. Among the first to suffer at the hands of the twisted couple was Fred’s stepdaughter Charmaine. Rose killed the eight-year-old in  when Fred was in prison. When Charmaine’s mum, Fred’s first we Rena Costello, came looking for her, Fred murdered her. He had also murdered a former girlfriend, Anna McFall, who was pregnant with his child.

Posting on Facebook, she said: We approached the family to ask themthey can please not leave without picking up their rubbish, their response was basicallywe have a problem then we can pick it up and that thats what the council is for. She claimed four or five ladies had stood around her, saying they were going to hit her. But the group hit back in an interview with the Herald, and family member David Johnson said rubbish left behind the group was not the end of the world.

In an angry interview , Auckland Mayor Phil Goff told a student radio station: Ive asked the council to follow up because I want to see them loaded with an infringement fine for trashing our country.

All you are really thinking about day-to-day is the next game and getting three points.“Maybe afterwards there will be people talking about it and you are pleased you’ve got a win for him because it is the first time he’s been here.“Before a game, though, it’s not something we’re thinking about.”And,Nesbitt and his team-mates would have liked to have played better in front of the man who pays their wages, he believes the owner could take encouragement from the way United battled for three big points.In danger of being detached at the turn of the year, back-to-back defeats for Ross County and Ayr have left United just one win off the pace in the battle for automatic promotion.And,the former Celtic kid would have liked to have put on a better show for everyone who was at Tannadice, he knows getting the job done mattered most.“Three points and the results where went our way, that makes it a good day.“It was, obviously, a bit of a battle but we got there in the end and that’s what matters.Performance-wise it wasn’t the best and we would expect to play a lot better than that and put on a show but sometimes circumstances in a game mean it doesn’t go that way and then you need to grind it out and win it.”If Nesbitt was nothing like satisfied with his own display, he had the consolation of knowing for the second week running he played a part in a vital goal.His debut against Partick saw him win the penalty to earn United a point and on Saturday he provided the cross for Nicky Clark’s dramatic late winner.“It’s good to contribute when you’re new and I’ve done that in my first two games.“My game play against Dunfermline wasn’t good enough but to make contributions is important andI’m still making those contributions when I’m playing better I will be happy.”In setting up the all-important goal, Nesbitt showed character. He had not been happy with his performance but he wasn’t going to hide.“I had a pass that went nowhere and, before the goal, a cross that went right to their keeper.“When that happens you can put your head down and go into a shell, especially in a game like that one but you just need to keep going, believe in yourself.“I kept going and when I saw Cammy I cut it back to him. It came back out to me and I saw a couple of boys running. Nicky made a brilliant run and when I saw him I just put it in that area and let him meet it. He’s done that and finished brilliantly. It was scrappy but one good ball and one good header and it’s a good day.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/01/5c41d925525d28.88073341.jpg ","title":"dundee uniteds sam stanton does not want to experience another scottish cup shock","story":"Sam Stanton has been on both ends of cup shocks in his time, and it’s the feeling when he was on the wrong end of one that makes him determined to make sure Dundee United win their fourth-round tie against Montrose.As a Hibs player, Stanton was part of the side that made an unexpected exit at the hands of Raith Rovers.That painful memory is one he does not want to experience again.“I’ve actually had good and bad in the cup and, hopefully, this can be another good memory,” said the midfielder.“When I was at Dumbarton, we had a couple of games where we weren’t expected to win and did, so that was a nice feeling.“But, when I was at Hibs, we were beaten by Raith and that definitely wasn’t a nice experience.“They were in the Championship and we were in the Premier League, so everyone expected us to get through. It wasn’t good when we lost.“That feeling is one you don’t want again and results like that one just show you can’t take anything for granted.“Teams in Scotland in all the leagues have good players and,you don’t have the proper approach, you will have problems.”And Stanton expects Montrose to battle tooth and nail to cause a shock tomorrow but believes United will be ready to cope with that.“These are dficult games because you know one team is giving everything they can to beat you because they have that nothing-to-lose mentality about them.“I’ve been there myself in those cup-ties when I was with Dumbarton, where you play teams who are bigger than your club and you don’t normally play against.“It excites you and it’s a chance for you to show how good you are. It’s why,you’re the bigger team, you can never take these games for granted.”He believes the key to avoiding a shock is treating the opposition with the respect they deserve and working towards the tie asit was a big game.“We have prepared for this one like we do every other game and that makes sure you have the right attitude.“The manager has had his videos of Montrose and been telling us about their strengths and weaknesses.“That way you make sure you are going into the game with the right mentality.”And,promotion from the Championship this term is by far the No  goal, Stanton admits he would love to go as far as possible in the cup.“A cup run is always important for the supporters and we know that.“For the players as well, it’s nice to do well and, as a football club, it is always important that we go as far as we can in the cup.“It’s another game we want to win and,you can string some wins together in the league and add a cup run to that as well, it’s always a help.”Stanton is also well aware that a side story tomorrow will be Tangerines legend Sean Dillon coming up against them for the first time since he ended a -year stay at Tannadice in .He expects the man who won the cup with United in  to get a rousing welcome from Arabs but, once that is out of the way and the game kicks off, it will be business as usual.“Sean left before I arrived at United but I know what a good player he was for the club.“He was here a long time and I’m sure he will get a good reception from our fans who travel up there.“For us, it’s about making sure he’s not the one getting clapped off the pitch after the game has finished.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/01/5c4079a3cf34a9.68815705.jpg ","title":"dundee winger andy dales looking to make instant impact","story":"Dundee winger Andy Dales is hoping to hit the ground running after checking in at Dens Park on loan from Scunthorpe United.The -year-old former Derby County youth academy product has joined up with the Dark Blues until the end of the season and goes straight into the squad for Saturday’s Scottish Cup fourth-round visit of Queen of the South.It was a deal that was agreed quickly, so much so, the England C international had to race north on Monday morning to complete the move.He has been in training with Jim McIntyre’s men since and is hoping to make his debut at Dens this weekend.“It’s been really good, I had a little chat with the gaffer on Tuesday morning and have had some intense training sessions so I’m really looking forward to it,” said Dales.“I only found out on Monday morning.

I’ve enjoyed it, the lads, the training, everything about it has been good,” said the man who is teaming up again with boss Jim McIntyre after their time together at Ross County.“The fitness levels are really good and the lads are at it. You can see they are up for the fight and there is some really good quality here, there’s no doubt about that, so it’s looking promising.”And the Liverpudlian believes three weeks off has given Dundee the chance to recharge their batteries.“I think the break has been a good thing, mentally in particular. I’ve been in this position and sometimes when you are in that rut when you are finding it dficult to pick up points it’s nice to have that break.“Mentally and physically you get away from it and then you come back in like it’s almost a new season, so I think it has been welcome.“And the mood here has been good but I don’t think I’ve been surprised by that because the lads know there is enough here and we are adding a few more bodies, so we know we have what’s needed.“We are up for a fight and you can see that looking round.”Curran believes that willingness, starting with tomorrow’s cup-tie, to do whatever it takes to get wins will be vital in the coming weeks.“There are times when it’s not going to be pretty because of where we’re at. There is going to be that sense of anxiousness going into games but we have that hunger and drive to overcome that.“There might be games that are ugly but these are ones we need to make sure we go on and win.“Whether we scrap it out - or -, we have to win and, once we do, we can then go and play a bit like I know we are capable of.”If, on paper, Dundee have been handed the perfect opportunity to report back with a win by being paired with a side from the second tier, Curran knows they’ll have to perform to make the next round.His time at Tannadice taught him there are decent outfits in that ision and, after facing them twice, he puts Queens in that category.“This is not going to be an easy game, just because they are in the Championship, no one can think that.“They have boys who are good players – Stephen Dobbie is on fire right now with his goals.“So, the mentality is the one thing we have to make sure is right and that’s not something I think we have an issue with. We have to make sure we come out on top, that’s our aim.”Curran also took the opportunity to stress he left United on good terms and thanked Tangerines boss Robbie Neilson for allowing him to move early in the January window.“I had a good relationship with Robbie and I only have good things to say about him.“The style he wanted was to play with one striker and Pavol Safranko has been the best player at United by a margin, I feel.“I understood that and he understood what an opportunity this move was for me.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/12/5c051af07378a-e1543840266799-940x555.jpg ","title":"tom duthie scottish football should never allow merger of dundees clubs","story":"The latest outbreak of merger fever in Dundee was no more than another in a long list of  alarms among the city’s football public.It’s not unlike the hypochondriac who catches a cold and immediately thinks he’s gone down with pneumonia.The revelation Dundee owner Tim Keyes wants to increase his shareholding to over % and remove the right of the club’s supporters’ society to veto any merger with neighbours United, had temperatures running high.With another American, Mark Ogren, now in control at Tannadice, fans of both clubs had been examining the “symptoms” and reached the diagnosis that a coming together was desired.That shows the accusation the media never let the facts get in the way of a good story can also, sometimes, be levelled at supporters.All along a forensic examination of the timeline of those symptoms strongly suggested this had everything to do with Keyes wanting to be able to build his new stadium at Camperdown without having to get the go-ahead from the fans’ group.Moving away from Dens is another on the list of protected items they can block and,Keyes is going to spend millions on “Nou Campie”, it’s not stretching the imagination to see why he might not want to need permission from a group that won’t be asked to inject a penny.More signicant is the fact Dundee first raised the matter months ago – before Ogren was on the scene at United. Even though this was a case of putting two and two together and getting five, it shows, despite merger being mooted and quickly dismissed on numerous occasions down the decades, it remains a worrying subject for the fans.And while those further afield may see a lot of sense in a one-club city, for those punters who actually turn up at Dens and Tannadice, it is the nightmare scenario. They’ll take hard times like financial crisis and relegation and stick with their team but what they’d never do is watch a merged team.That alone is why such a move is too dangerous. The clubs should always take the “nos” of the fans who go to games over the “I woulds” of potential new customers of a ‘Dundee City’.There is every chance a build-it-and-they-will-come merger would leave us with a club only slightly bigger than the two that exist.That wouldn’t just be bad for the city but Scottish football and it makes it surprising that, when the topic is raised, no one at the top of the game has come out against it.While sporting performance is rightly the normal criteria for the make-up of our top ision,ever it was to be done on size of club, Dundee and United would be in there – and comfortably so.If Premiership membership was decided on that second basis the top  would be something like Celtic, Rangers, Aberdeen, Hearts, Hibs, Dundee United, Dundee, Motherwell, Kilmarnock, St Johnstone, Falkirk and St Mirren.The likes of Morton, Dunfermline and Inverness may argue they should be in there but it would be on the basis they have more potential than the names at the end of that list.When it comes to core support, the first seven clubs listed are untouchable. If Glasgow giants Rangers or Celtic, on their own, are bigger than the rest put together, those from the country’s three other major cities are also well ahead of the others below them.To reiterate, in all but exceptional circumstances, results should determine who’s in the top league, so it’s up to the likes of United to get back there by winning matches.But when the Tangerines and the Dark Blues are in the top flight, Scottish football is the better for it.That will always be the case."},{"url":null,"title":"mcdonalds-launches-veggie-happy-meals-as-greggs-sells-vegan-sausage-rolls","story":"MCDONALDrsquoS restaurants across Glasgow have launched their first-ever vegetarian Happy Meal for children from today."},{"url":null,"title":"richard-madden-flashback-to-when-rising-actor-spoke-to-the-evening-times","story":"RENFREWSHIRE actor Richard Madden has picked up a Golden Globe for his role in gripping BBC drama Bodyguard."},{"url":null,"title":"sir-andy-murray-from-dunblane-to-double-olympic-champion","story":"FROM gangly, wild-haired teenager to one of Britainrsquos great sporting heroes, Sir Andy Murray may have been forced to hang up his rackets but his impact will be felt for generations."},{"url":null,"title":"dennys-bosses-slam-unforgiving-customers-after-being-bombarded-with-terrible-reviews","story":"DENNYrsquoS bosses have hit back at ldquounforgiving customers who have left negative feedback after visiting the dinerrsquos newly-opened branch near Glasgow."},{"url":null,"title":"celtic-manager-brendan-rodgers-expects-to-bring-in-more-players-but-central-defender-looks-unlikely","story":"For those Celtic fans still eagerly trawling social media sites for hints and clues about the possibility of further signings, there was some good news yesterday afternoon as Brendan Rodgers reaffirmed that he would still like to make a few new additions before the end of the current window."},{"url":null,"title":"scotrail-reduce-carriages-during-rush-hour-between-glasgow-central-and-east-kilbride","story":"Scotrailcommuters were left with reduced carriageson services travelling betweenGlasgowCentral and East Kilbride this morning."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-wakes-to-heavy-frost-after-coldest-night-of-winter-so-far","story":"It seems that winter is well and truly here as the country saw temperatures plummet to the coldest they have been this seasonlast night."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-reacts-to-plummeting-temperatures","story":"As much of the country prepares for disruptions due to snow and ice, Glaswegians have been feeling the cold here in the city - and theyre not happy."},{"url":null,"title":"whisky-galore-as-glasgows-tall-ship-gets-go-ahead-to-sell-drams","story":"VISITORS at Glasgowrsquos Tall Ship will be able to treat themselves to an unusual souvenir as they walk along the decks of the historic asset."},{"url":null,"title":"callum-mcgregor-ready-to-make-history-as-celtic-bid-for-historic-treble","story":"Making history has become Brendan Rodgersrsquo trademark at Celtic.

When did two players from Mid Argyll help Rangers win the Scottish Cup The answer is # . Local girls Jasmine McPhie and Carla Todd were both key players in Rangers Girls triumphant run in the Girls Under  Scottish Cup.In their run to the final, Rangers played the top four under  girls teams in Scotland beating Aberdeen - in the first round, then Hamilton - and Central Girls - in rounds two and three. A quarter-final tie against Glasgow City saw the Rangers Girls win - to set up an old firm semi-final against Celtic Girls in which the Rangers Girls emerged - winners in a close game.The final was played on Saturday November  at the Oriam Performance Centre in Edinburgh. In a competitive match, Rangers started strong but Hibernian began to come into the game and whilst both sides had chances, the score remained - at half time. In the second half, Rangers took the lead in  minutes but three minutes later Hibernian drew level.There were few chances in the remainder of the second half and at full time both teams were level at -. Rangers took the lead again in extra time with a deserved winner to secure the cup.Jasmine and Carla came through the Lochgilphead Soccer Centre from primary one age to primary seven, playing in local festivals.In   the girls were important members of the successful Lochgilphead Red Star  team which won the DFDL league cup and finished second in their league. At the end of that season they joined Rangers Girls where they are in their second season playing mostly in the Paisley League against boys teams but also in national girls# competitions.Both girls have also been involved in Scotland national squads for their age group and the Soccer Centre is delighted to see them thriving with a big club.With more than  girls now playing football through the Soccer Centre, the success of Jasmine and Carla should be a real inspiration for local girls.So girls, you may live out in rural Mid Argyll but with talent, hard work and the right attitude you could be creating your own football opportunities."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 01","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThe conditions being endured by refugees on a remote Greek island might seem of little importance to folk living in Argyll, but Pam Gregory spends time helping make their lives easier.More volunteers are desperately needed to assist as conditions worsen during the winter and Samos Volunteers would love to hear from anyone with the inclination to help.Pam#s dedication and the support of the Craignish community deserve great credit.

Invited to join Cameron up at the Cruachan dam for the second of his two recent programmes, I was delighted to tramp the mighty mountain with Scotland’s Number one authority on outdoor pursuits.As an author and broadcaster, Cameron always has an eye on a good story, and so as well as asking me about the lack of health and safety regulations at the time the hydro project was being built, he also wanted to knowthere really was a murder during the construction. There was, as I told him, a body – but the body wasn’t identied, no arrests were made, no court case took place.It would be a shamethat construction period went down in history as an invasion of , workmen – #Tunnel Tigers# as they were dubbed – into one of Argyll#s most beautul settings and a possible murder.My book was intended to give the story of the local people whose lives were punctuated by this ambitious construction project. Quite rightly, those Tunnel Tigers had been lauded in a number of publications. The work that was done hollowing out Argyll’s highest mountain to provide electricity for the nation was amazing.The plan for Cruachan – as for the other major hydro projects of the post World War II era – was conceived by Tom Johnston, to whom I dedicated my book. Johnston was a politician who remained true to his ideals of bringing rural Scotland into the modern world. There was no power in the Highlands, and without power there could be no industry and no prosperity. The engineering genius was Sir Edward MacColl, whose biographer Norrie Fraser called him #a maker of modern Scotland#.Cruachan was the first reversible pumped-storage system in the world. During its years of construction from  to , eminent international engineers visited the project to see how the water was pumped between two reservoirs through reversible turbine generators. At off-peak hours, the water was – is # pumped back up to the reservoir you see high up in the corrie above Loch Awe, held back by a dam that is now so much a part of our landscape. The loch itself is the lower reservoir.I had imagined that the scale of such a project – using Scotland’s top engineering companies who shipped in workers from other parts of the UK and Europe – would have been a cause for resentment and protest by local people.That, of course, failed to take account of the vision of the folk of Dalmally, Lochawe, and Taynuilt. Although it took men with engineering experience to blast the  miles of tunnels, hollow out the mountain itself, and construct the dam, there was also a need for a support army. There were clerks and porters, joiners and caterers, folk willing to let out a room, a caravan, a house, serve in a pub where just occasionally it was necessary to keep a baseball bat behind the bar to maintain bonhomie. The project kick started careers, fortunes and marriages, and gave the area good roads and a tourist industry.If you haven’t visited the hollow mountain or walked Cruachan’s slopes, make  the year you do.[In bold please] Cruachan: The Hollow Mountain is available from the Argyll Book Centre in Lochgilphead and all good book shops, along with Marian Pallister#s other books of local interest.PICS:The Pass of Brander before work started. no_aCruachanLe before the project # the Loch Awe Hotel with steamers. no_aCruachanThe Queen opening the project in October . no_aCruachanWorking on the  miles of tunnels. no_aCruachanWorking on the road to the dam, overlooking Loch Awe. no_aCruachan"},{"url":null,"title":"sports club lotteries 9","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowDrawn on Monday January , Kilmory Camanachd Club#s lottery numbers were ,  and .

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13865741.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/2_JS172700549.jpg","title":"brexit conservative remainer mp admits","story":"NewsBrexit: Conservative Remainer MP admits he would consider voting Leave in second referendumBill Grant says \"arrogance\" from EU negotiators may push him towards voting Leaveany second referendum arose.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  JAN NewsBill Grant MP \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA Scots Tory MP says he would consider performing a Brexit u-turnBritain goes back to the polls.

Tory group leader Martin Dowey made the plea for the area to be more car-friendly following the announcement of the closure of Hourstons last week. Councillor Dowey urged the council to ease parking charges in the High Street in a bid to encourage more footfall to the area. Speaking at Seafield, Fort and Wallacetown Community Council last Wednesday, he said: “I am frustrated and saddened at Hourstons closing. “Given the retail climate, it wasn’t unexpected.” The councillor said internet and retail park shopping had contributed to the demise of town centres across the country. “Town centre shops need to be smaller and more niche,” he added. “The town centre is far too big for the size of Ayr.   “We need to utilise what we have got to encourage footfall.” SNP ward councillor Siobhian Brown is disappointed that the iconic store is to close and said a long-term plan is needed to attract more people back to the town centre. “It is a sign of times as people buy online,” she added. Norman McLean, the community council’s chairman, said: “It didn’t get the footfall. It was only a couple of months ago I was in the store and I felt like I was the only person there. “Has the council got any contingency plans  “What about waiving the cost of the first hour parking at parking meters ” The meeting heard that Hourstons were paying pound, per year in business rates before they started paying staff and other costs. Now the iconic building could be turned into flats or used by the council for offices.   Councillor Dowey added: “We need more parking and we have to bring cars back into the High Street. “The one-way system brought in the s was probably a good idea then but it is not such a good idea now. “People don’t drive down the High Street as much any more and they don’t see how bad the bottom end is. “I am guilty as anyone because I go to Heathfield for shopping because you can get parking there.” One community councillor said more must be done to attract sport and culture to the town centre to get people back there. “Retail cannot be sustained,” he insisted. “We need cultural tourism to do draw people into the town centre.” Another pointed out that shops in Prestwick and Troon are thriving: “The dference between Prestwick and Ayr is that they have all small units and in Ayr it is all big High Street units for the past  or  years. Big units cost too much.” "},{"url":null,"title":"bossy-and-edwin-line-up-in-gala-for-independent-venue-week","story":"GALASHIELS is in for a two-fold treat during this years Independent Venue Week celebrations.Hundreds of smaller venues across the UK will feature supportive bands and artists between Monday, January  and Sunday, February .And entertaining the Mac Arts in Galashiels will be an exciting double-bill of the very best in new Scottish music.The frighteningly-good Bossy Love, who seem to be everyones favourite new band, are supported by the equally talented Edwin Organ.Glasgow-based Bossy Love burst onto the music scene just over two years ago.And ever since, their refreshing, accomplished and highly infectious RnB-infused pop has been winning them fans and plaudits up and down the country.Amandah Wilkinson and John Baillie Jnr have been described byas sounding like Prince on a trampoline.And their deadly hooks and fearless, anthemic lyrics sitting atop propulsive, rich production has them as radio regulars on  Music.Itrsquos on stage, however, that fans truly get to witness Bossy Loversquos magic.With explosive, searing energy from the very first bar, they command absolute stage presence with the ease, confidence and effortless charm that only comes from years spent honing their skills at the front of the worldrsquos stages.In other words, an act not to be missed this Independent Venue Week.Although Edwin Organ may not yet have enjoyed the same exposure as Bossy Love, the Dunfermline synthpop wizard has already accepted invites to play the likes of T in the Park and Electric Fields.And his terric EP, Missing the T, with its scattered beats and melodic foundations has been gaining more and more airplay.A spokeswoman for Mac Arts said: \"As part of the nationwide Independent Venues Week  do not miss the chance to see these two incredible acts live.\"Bossy Love and Edwin Organ play the Mac Arts on Friday, February .Tickets, priced at just pound, are available from www.ticketsource macarts or the box office on  .Doors open at .pm with Edwin Organ taking the stage around pm."},{"url":null,"title":"pet-of-the-week","story":"This weeks Pet Of The Week, from Borders Pet Rescue, is five-year-old Pal.The charity told us: \"Pal came in to us as his owner was struggling to cope with him.

The storyteller smiled and nodded: ldquoYes we all have dreams of being rich, but rich in what  Rich in love and happiness, or rich in money and things ldquoItrsquos the same, said one child. ldquoI donrsquot think it is, said another, looking at the storyteller. ldquoIs it ldquoThat is a good question, replied the storyteller, ldquofor sure having too little money is not a good thing. And the world is an unfair place where those who have too much money and too many things keep it to themselves, so those who have too little money never get their fair share, even though there is sufficient for everyone to have enough.ldquoSo I want to be one of those that has too much! declared one member of the class, to laughter.ldquoAndso would you share what you have with others who do not have enough  asked the storyteller.The child paused for a moment for thought: ldquoMaybe some of it.Other children voiced dferent opinions. ldquoIrsquod keep it all, ldquoIrsquod share it, ldquoIrsquod give some to my family and friends.It created some discussion amongst the children.The teacher was going to ask the children to be quiet and listen to the storyteller, but he indicated he was happy with what was happening.ldquoBut then yoursquod end up being poor again, said one. ldquoNo, Irsquod not give it all away.ldquoBut the whole point of being rich is that you can do what you want.ldquoWell, it also means you can help other people.The storyteller listened to the debate for a minute or two, then he beat his drum to regain the childrenrsquos attention.ldquoAnd so, for most here, money will be your dream. I understand that. Nobody wants to be poor. But lots of money is not really your dream.A chorus of: ldquoYes it is!ldquoNo, replied the storyteller, ldquomoney is not your dream, it is what you spend it on, what it might make possible for you that you do not have now, that would be your dream. That is what you must think of before you set out on your quest.ldquoBecauseyou pick the apple of your dreams, but have no dreams for your le, then you will still be poor, evenyou have all the money in the world.ldquoThatrsquos just stupid, said one boy. The teacher was quick to remind him not to be rude, but the storyteller asked him: ldquoWhat is stupid ldquoWhat yoursquove just said, you canrsquot be pooryou are rich, that doesnrsquot make sense. Thatrsquos what I meant is stupid.The storyteller smiled. ldquoPerhaps you are right, but do you think sometimes people can also be poor in things that money canrsquot buy There was silence for a moment. Then a girl said: ldquoYou mean people can be poor in dreams for their le The storyteller smiled and nodded.ldquoPrecisely, said the storyteller. ldquoThe whole issue of getting rich has stopped us thinking about what our dreams actually are.ldquoI want to be a dancer, said one child. ldquoI want to drive fast cars, said another.ldquoI still want to be rich so I donrsquot have to do anything and just play computer games.ldquoI want to make the computer games, said his friend. ldquoYeah, me too, agreed his pal.ldquoI want to be the President! another said.ldquoI just want to be happy!The storyteller beat his drum again.ldquoAnd so before you set off on your quest you must think about your dreams. And let me tell you that dreams can be shared too.ldquoHowrsquod you do that  he was asked.The storyteller thought for a moment: ldquoWell, for some their dream may be to save an animal that is in danger of being extinct.ldquoOr save the planet, called out another.ldquoThatrsquos why I want to be President.ldquoSo I want you to think about your dreams, and once you have you got your dreams you are ready for your quest into the forest, said the storyteller.The children assembled their thoughts and soon everyone had a collection of dreams to take with them to the apple tree.ldquoThere is one more thing I forgot to tell you, said the storyteller. ldquoItrsquos an important piece of information. You see, when you finally get to the clearing you must be very careful, for wrapped around the base of the ancient apple tree there is a ferocious dragon.ldquoIt sleeps, but very lightly. It will wake when you approach the tree. It will hear you no matter how quiet. It will hear your heartbeat. And there is no place to hide in the clearing. The moment you approach the tree, the dragon will pounce on you.ldquoCan the dragon fly  asked one.ldquoYes.ldquoAnd breathe fire ldquoYes.There were murmurings.ldquoAnd so, the storyteller continued, ldquoyou must decide how you will overcome and defeat the dragon. It is there to stop you reaching the apple of your dreams.Some of the children came up with immediate ideas:ldquoIrsquod run as fast as I could in zig zags.ldquoIrsquod distract the dragon.ldquoIrsquod shoot the dragon with a gun.ldquoIrsquod make a giant kite and fly to the apple.ldquoIrsquod take some friends and feed them to the dragon while I get the apple, then dream my friends back again.There were many solutions and the storyteller listened to them with interest. Each child came up with a dferent strategy.The storyteller nodded, explaining the powers of the dragon that it couldnrsquot be killed by bullets or blades or fire, that it was faster than lightning and once it had heard you and seen you it would go for you.ldquoKnowing all this, are you still going to try and defeat the dragon and reach the apple of your dreams They all said yes, refining their ideas.And so once the children had come up with their final strategy, the storyteller asked them to think about what they might need to take with them to defeat the dragon. They will have to carry these things through the forest, or perhaps collect them on the way.Then the storyteller set the children the task of drawing the things they would need and then the dragon and apple tree. In drawing the apple they would have to decide what the apple of their dreams would look like.When this was all done, the children settled down to hear who had the right answer.ldquoI have looked at all the ideas, said the storyteller. ldquoWhat I must say is that le is unfair and so is this quest. For some, the journey through the forest will be longer than others. The dragon will be more dficult to defeat for some than others, as its mood changes. But you have all come up with the same answer, and so you are all right.There were howls of protest.ldquoNo, we didnrsquot we all have dferent answers!The storyteller beat his drum again to calm the children.ldquoWell yes, you all have dferent ideas on how to defeat the dragon and reach the apple, that is true. But you all have the same answer to the most important question.ldquoWhatrsquos that  the children asked.ldquoWell, said the storyteller, ldquoI had told you how fierce and dreadful the dragon could be.

And so I think I shall.A story from your head is a term I use to describe a story either made up on the spot or a remembered story that was made up at an earlier time. So essentially itrsquos a story that isnrsquot written down anywhere or got from a book.Of course, reading to, and with, children is really important. But making stories together with a child is a really bonding experience and a fantastic way to encourage the child to explore and develop her or his creative imagination.This dadrsquos child is quite young but the process Irsquom about to describe can be used for any age group, and indeed yourself.Firstly, I want you to think of a mountain. You are standing at its base on one side and you want to get to the other side. In order to do so you will need to climb to the summit first. This mountain in your imagination is going to initially help you make a story, because itrsquos called a story mountain.So now you are standing at the base of the story mountain. You need a few things before you begin your journey to the summit, and the first thing is a character or characters.This is the first question to ask your child: who is in the story  Let them decide, and it can be anyone or anything: a dragon, a princess, a footballer, Spiderman, a Minion, a witch, a boy or girl, or even your child themselves.Next question is to find which place the story begins, that is what the setting is for the beginning of the tale. So you can ask where the character is.It can be an imaginary setting or a real one, perhaps even local, itrsquos up to the child for example, answers might include ldquothe dragon is hiding in a school or ldquothe princess lives in a cave.Once you have a character or characters and some kind of setting you have the beginning of the story. ldquoOnce upon a time, a dragon was hiding in a schoolhellip ldquoThere was once a princess who lived in a cavehellipYou can now help the child to add a few detailsyou wish by asking simple questions about the characters and or the settings. For example: ldquoWhy is the dragon hiding in the school  Or: ldquoWhat does the cave look like Questions like these can help direct the story towards what is going to happen, and that is the next part of your journey up the slope to the summit of your story mountain.So the child may say: ldquoThe dragon is hiding in the school because itrsquos scared of a bigger dragon. Or: ldquoThe cave is cold.Now we have the characters and setting, itrsquos time to make the climb to the summit of the story mountain. This climb represents the issue within the story: a problem, a task or quest, a desire or dream to be sought, a need for change or something to be found and so on. In other words, itrsquos the beginning of the adventure.Itrsquos at this point that beginning the process of visualisation is useful. Visualisation is a technique used by storytellers to help them remember a tale and tell it in their own words. It involves actually imagining yourself in the story, asyou are there.So before you set off on the story, imagine the dragon in the school, enter into the image in your head. Is it your old school, what does the dragon look like, where in the school is it hiding, what are its emotions Likewise with the princess, can you see her in the cave  Enter it in your imagination and look around. Is it large or small, cosy or scary  Where does she sleep and can you see the princess shivering in the cold  What is she feeling and thinking This is what story is all about, entering the world of imagination. Itrsquos not the words you need to remember but the images in your mind. Itrsquos like they become a memory which you can later describe.Your child will have his or her own visualisations, but you can help develop that by asking questions and allowing the child to describe what he or she sees.Painting vivid moving pictures in your mindrsquos eye is the key to not only remembering but developing the story.So now we may have a terried small dragon hiding in the dinner hall of your childrsquos school, and a shivering princess sitting by a small campfire in a huge cave, feeling hungry.The next step is to find out what is going to happen. This begins us on the journey to the summit of the story mountain. To give the child ownership of the story, ask him or her questions like: ldquoSo does the big dragon find the one hiding in the school  Or: ldquoWhat does the princess do to make the cave warmer and get something to eat Now we have the issue that takes us up the hill to the summit. The summit represents the transformative moment in the story, the thing or person or happening that alters the course of events. In any story, this is an important ingredient.So perhaps we will end up with: ldquoThe big dragon flies into the playground and all the children run. But the teacher comes out and is really strict and makes it go away so the children are safe, and so is the wee dragon. Or: ldquoThe princess goes fishing. And she sees a pirate ship while shersquos fishing and decides she wants to be a pirate instead.So the headteacher and the pirate ship are the transformative factors in these examples. They change the course of the story, and in doing so the journey back down the other side of the mountain can now take place, for this represents the conclusion or ending of the tale.Is it a happy, sad, funny ending  So questions like ldquowhat happens to the wee dragon  and ldquodoes the princess enjoy being a pirate and living on the pirate ship  may lead to answers that the wee dragon loves the school and becomes a part of the P class and learns to read, and that the princess becomes the pirate captain.So now the base of the other side of the mountain has been reached, with the storyrsquos ending. Now you can take away the structure of the mountain and lay down the bones of the story you have made along the journey.Here are the bones: wee dragon hides in a school from a bigger dragon, teacher chases bigger dragon away, wee dragon decides he likes the school and stays and joins P princess is in cave cold and hungry, she goes fishing by the sea and sees a pirate ship, she joins the pirate crew and becomes the captain.The visualisation technique can now be used to put flesh on the bones, giving it more detail. You can revisit the tale and develop it later, or leave it as it is.In telling the story, donrsquot think of words, think of the images created in your head, then the words will come naturally as you describe what you see.This way you will remember the story. You may tell it slightly dferently each time, but thatrsquos fine. Your child may remind you of how it was told before, as he or she will have their own visualisation of the tale.Or your child may ask you for a dferent story, in which case you are back at the base of another story mountain ready to climb it!Happy storytelling!"},{"url":null,"title":"plans-for-250-more-homes-in-dunbar-to-be-revealed","story":"Members of the public have the chance to view the

Under the terms of an amendment tabled by Dominic Grieve and controversially passed by MPs, she has until Monday to present a new plan to the Commons.While the details of this Plan B are not clear, the chairman of the Eurosceptic European Research Group, Jacob Rees-Mogg, wrote in the Mail on Sunday that it was possible for Mrs May to get a deal through the Commonsshe persuaded the EU to show flexibility on the backstop and pound billion orce bill.ldquoIf I had to choose between no deal and Mrs Mayrsquos original accord, I would have no hesitation of opting for no-deal Brexit but even Mrs Mayrsquos deal would be better than not leaving at all, he wrote.ndash Itrsquos good to talk: Mrs May has offered to talk to opposition parties and groups with dferent desires and views to find consensus in Parliament.

Such a vote could trigger a general election but this is very much the nuclear option for Tory rebels and the DUP have already said they will not vote with Labour, so it appears to be a forlorn hope.ndash Back to Brussels for more talks: The EU has said repeatedly that it will not reopen negotiations on the Withdrawal Agreement, and ldquoassurances on the Irish border backstop were dismissed by Brexiteers earlier this week.

She makes it sound like paradise.ldquoWhen I was growing up, Teddy, we had everybody in our neighbourhood, so I didnrsquot think about race or colour or anything like that.Spector comes from a mixed-race family. Her dad was Irish, her mum was ldquoblack and Cherokee. Her skin was lighter as a result, but race or colour didnrsquot figure much, she says.ldquoI thought everybody had a neighbourhood like mine, with Jewish delis and Chinese restaurants and black barbecue places. I grew up in a wonderful time. There were no gangs or dope. It was just a wonderful regular childhood. It wasnrsquot crazy.In my mind, I tell her, back then there were doo wop groups singing on every corner in Spanish Harlem. ldquoWe didnrsquot see much of the doo wops on the street, she admits. ldquoWe werenrsquot allowed to go out that much. But I love that because we had a huge family and we were protected. Thatrsquos why a lot of groups got messed up because they didnrsquot have anybody to trust. My mother travelled everywhere with us England, Scotland, America, everywhere, so it was like coming home from school. We never got into drugs and alcohol and all that stuff because your mother was there.I imagine it must have been an eye-opener when she did then go on tour and find that America wasnrsquot really like Spanish Harlem. But Spector says not. ldquoYou didnrsquot think of race, she says.That said, she does recall being on tour as part of Dick Clarkrsquos Caravan of Stars, a package put together by the American radio and TV presenter, and stopping who knows where, but definitely not Spanish Harlem, for food.One black doo wop group wouldnrsquot get off the bus, she remembers. ldquoThey said, lsquoRonnie, would you bring us back a hamburger rsquo I thought it was strange, but at  you didnrsquot pay that any attention. I didnrsquot know what I know now that they were actually afraid to get off the bus.Spector always sang. She remembers at five getting up on the coffee table at home and singing silly songs to a family audience. ldquoMy family would applaud and that stuck in my mind forever.When she was eight Spector used to go her grandmotherrsquos after school with her cousins and shersquod stand in the lobby and sing. ldquoIt was the echo in that hallway that made me feel like, I can really sing. Irsquom like eight or nine years old and Irsquom singing Frankie Lymon songs and all my cousins are backing me up with all the doo wop stuff and thatrsquos my first memory of saying lsquoI can sing.rsquoIn  Frankie Lymon ndash a Harlem boy, a boy destined for self-destruction, a boy who would OD on heroin at the age of  ndash released an album entitled At the London Palladium. She loved it, loved Frankiersquos voice. A few years later The Ronettes would be at the Palladium themselves.When Spector was  years old The Ronettes played the Apollo amateur night. ldquoMy mother would say to me, lsquoIf they like you yoursquove got it made,they donrsquot, finish your schoolwork.rsquoldquoThey loved me, so I knew that I would be a somebody in the business. I didnrsquot know how or when or who.The when was , the who Phil Spector, the how was singing Be My Baby.Other hits would follow. Baby I Love You, Walking in the Rain, most notably. The sixties had started, pop music in all its immediacy and innocence was in full bloom and The Ronettes were part of that. ldquoWe looked dferent from everybody . We had our own hair when most groups wore wigs.Success meant access. Spector met the Beatles, toured with the Stones. These days she lives just  minutes away from Keith Richards. She met him a month ago when she was going into her dentist and he was coming out.ldquoHis daughter was with him. Hersquos a changed man from that seventies era and whatever they were going through. Hersquos a great dad.Read More: Jenna Reid on launching album Working Hands at Celtic ConnectionsRonnie, I say, who was your favourite Beatle  ldquoJohn. As simple as that. He was so nice, and his mind was really intact. He knew what he wanted to do, knew what he wanted to write. We were friends. He took me to Carnaby Street and showed me where to get the T-shirts and the boots. Irsquod come back to America looking all English.ldquoHe was really my favourite one. We dated a couple of times. He took me to a couple of clubs and I remember him leaning over to me and saying, lsquoRonnie, sing a little bit of Be My Baby in my ear.rsquo And I sang, lsquoThe night we met I needed you so helliprsquo I looked over and he had passed out.Good memories. There are bad memories too. The fairy-tale le she was leading took a grim turn when she married Phil Spector. She met the producer, the ldquofirst tycoon of teenwhen she was . He made her a star and then he took it all away from her.The day after their wedding, she wrote in her  memoir Be My Baby: How I Survived Mascara, Miniskirts and Madness, she woke up to see men erecting barbed wire and gates around the Spector mansion in Beverley Hills.In the years that followed she found herself trapped at home by a controlling, abusive, paranoid man. He robbed her of performing, robbed her of her voice .The story has the odd black comic edge. When she did get permission to leave the house she had to drive in a car with a blow-up Phil Spector doll in the back. But her account of those years when published is mostly pure horror show. In the end she had to sneak out of the house and flee with the help of her mother.If anything, her memoir might have downplayed things. In  in an ultimately unsuccessful bid for unpaid royalties, Spector would claim in court that her husband pulled a gun on her during their marriage. In  Spector was found guilty of the murder of Lana Clarkson in Spectorrsquos home.Perhaps, given everything, we shouldnrsquot be surprised that she doesnrsquot want to talk about any of this now.ldquoEverybody knows that story. It wasnrsquot a relationship. I wrote a book about it. Itrsquos been well over  years since I left. I prefer the music we made together to speak rather than dwell on the negative, she says when I tentatively broach the subject.ldquoAs a matter of fact, that made me more positive today. All the hell I went through made me the woman I am today. I dusted myself off and went on with it. When I was there I wasnrsquot singing and that was my passion and without my singing it wasnrsquot even a world I was living in. It was hell.ldquoThatrsquos why I love the #MeToo movement now.

What would not be immediately clear is that Murphys crime, in the eyes of those who would silence her, is stating that men cannot become women.In fact her opponents would argue this is not just a crime in their eyes, but also according to the laws of the land. The reach of these laws ndash some federal, others provincial ndash is currently being tested, including in high-profile legal actions that are making headlines around the world.So why is a discussion on Gender Identity Ideology and Womens Rights so controversial, and what can Scotland learn from Canada about how to legislate around the contentious area of transgender rights  Equally, what might Canada be able to learn from us Our two nations have a few things in common. Each has a neighbour to the south with a population about ten times higher, each is led by a self-declared feminist, and each governing party prides itself on being progressive, especially in comparison to those southern neighbours. The leaders of both countries are, accordingly, loudly and proudly committed to promoting LGBT rights.Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was already a regular at Pride marches before his election in , while last year Nicola Sturgeon led Glasgow Pride during Donald Trumps visit to Scotland, shortly before the Scottish Government committed to including LGBT issues across the school curriculum. Back in November , weeks after Sturgeon apologised at Holyrood to gay men convicted of sexual offences that are no longer illegal, Trudeau issued a formal apology in the Ottawa legislature for the past oppression of the LGBTQ communities.Incidentally, the ldquo stands for two-spirited, a term that refers exclusively to indigenous people with distinct spiritual and ceremonial roles in their communities.The worldwide gender identity debate is, at heart, a debate about the meaning of words. In particular, the words ldquowoman, ldquoman and \"lesbian\". It is a debate about whether iniduals, groups, political parties or governments have the right to redefine those words, then compel others to accept the new meanings.The meaning of \"woman\" matters because this has implications for women-only spaces such as toilets, changing rooms and refuges. It matters because of the impact on all-women shortlists and womens sports. It matters because women around the world suffer discrimination as a consequence of being born female.Because the meaning of words directly affects how people ndash including the small minority who are transgender ndash navigate their day-to-day lives, this is a heated debate. And while many women politely nod along with mantras like \"transwomen are women\", either believing themselves to be progressive or fearful of the consequences of doing otherwise, many feminists are refusing to comply.It is a sufficiently heated debate that when Murphy and her fellow lists started to address an audience of around  women late on a Thursday night last week, there were more than two dozen security guards in the room and police officers too.Those who challenge the idea that men can become womenhave been called many things ndash ldquoTERFs , transphobes, bigots and even Nazis but in Canada ldquocoloniser is added to the mix, with the implication that such iniduals are also anti-indigenous people, anti-immigrant and pro-deportations. This goes down badly with those among their opponents who are indeed radical feminists, aligned to the left.Murphy grew up in a left-wing household, with a father who campaigned for Canadas New Democratic Party. But in recent years, since ldquocoming out as critical of gender identity ideology, she has found herself courted by those on the right, even those who strongly disagree with her positions on other issues such as abortion. When she was last year handed a permanent ban from social media site Twitter for questioning gender identity ideology ndash and then questioning Twitter for punishing her for doing so ndash she received a flood of supportive messages from right-wingers including Ben Shapiro, the influential US commentator.ldquoOf course Im aware that some of those outlets are using me for their own means, which is like, look at what the left is doing, its eating itself, but I dont really care, because theyre right, she says with a wry laugh.She believes politicians on the left who have backed a steady stream of policy changes informed by gender identity ideology ndash relating to everything from signage and the census to prisons and hate speech ndash are poorly informed. ldquoI think the politicians are advised to take a certain line and dont at all understand the implications of the arguments, and dont really think about it very much ... and eventhey did Im sure they would be too scared to say anything.Among those who have taken that line is Vancouvers newly elected mayor, Kennedy Stewart, who said of Murphys event: ldquoI find it despicable ... its not something I support at all. Murphy attempted to contact Stewart to find out what, exactly, he found despicable , but she received no response. Its clear, however, that Vancouver is very keen to promote itself as an LGBT-friendly city. Signs on lampposts ldquocelebrate queer Vancouver, stickers on doors announce ldquosafe places and rainbow and trans flags adorn public buildings.Unlike in Scotland, where the Scottish Trans Alliance has received government funding since , in Canada there is no national organisation pushing for changes to transgender rights. There are also no national womens rights campaign groups comparable to the UK-wide Fair Play for Women, Womens Place UKor For Women Scotland, arguing for the importance of protections based on biological sex. As a result there has been very little public debate about the implications of signicant changes ndash that is, except for the very public opposition of psychology professor Jordan Peterson to the inclusion of gender identity as a prohibited ground of discrimination.The question of gender identity has been in the news on this side of the Atlantic for months due to proposed changes to the Gender Recognition Act ndash a piece of legislation that was passed following a European Court of Human Rights case in . The introduction of the GRA meant that people who identied as the opposite sex could change their legal sex by amending their birth certicates. At that time it was already possible to change the sex recorded on documents such as driving licences and passports, but transwoman Christine Goodwin argued that because she had been refused a new National Insurance number that reflected her new identity, an employer had gained knowledge of her past living as a man and discriminated against her on this basis. The court ruled that preventing trans people from changing their legal sex contravened the European Convention on Human Rights.As the law stands, those applying to change their birth certicates must satisfy a  of medical and legal professionals that they have experienced gender dysphoria, defined by the NHS as ldquoa condition where a person experiences discomfort or distress because theres a mismatch between their biological sex and gender identity have lived in their acquired gender for two years and intended to live in that gender for le. Concepts such as ldquoliving in a gender were not defined in the legislation, with their interpretation left to those appointed to Gender Recognition Panels. Transgender activists now argue that restrictive, stereotypical notions of gender are used to assess whether an applicant is indeed ldquoliving in a given gender, and that the UKs approach wrongly characterises transgender identities as evidence of psychological problems. These are among the reasons why they argue that the UKshould adopt a system of gender self-ID, scrapping Gender Recognition Panels and instead requiring applicants to make a statutory declaration about their identity.The debate about Scotlands census, changes to which are being considered by the Culture, Tourism, Europe and External Affairs Committee, has become a proxy debate about self-ID, highlighting the fact that the current census format conflates sex and gender . The Scottish Government consulted on reforms to the Gender Recognition Act last year, and has pledged to bring forward legislation in this area soon.Official attitudes in Scotland have changed over time, due in large part to the efforts over the past decade of James Morton of the Scottish Trans Alliance. Writing about the challenges of securing and retaining funding for a trans-specic equality project, Morton has noted that the SNP, which inherited his pilot project from the previous coalition government in , ldquowere keen for the rest of Europe to recognise Scotland as a progressive, innovative country. He also explains the strategic thinking behind working with the Scottish Prison Service to introduce a gender identity policy ndashprisons could be persuaded to adopt a policy based on self-declaration in ldquovery challenging circumstances, other public services would likely follow.Those challenging circumstances have been in the spotlight since it emerged that Karen White, a male rapist who identies as a woman but is still legally male, had sexually assaulted female inmates after being remanded in a womens prison in England. White was described as an ldquoalleged transgender female by a prosecutor who suggested there was little evidence of any meaningful transition, but last week it was reported that the serial sex offender ndash who is serving a le sentence ndash is seeking cash from friends to fund gender reassignment surgery, in the belief this will guarantee a transfer back to the female estate.Trans activists argue that such cases are exceptions and that those who oppose prison policies based on self-ID are unfairly seeking to portray all transgender people as sexual predators. Womens rights groups argue that vulnerable women in prison, many of whom have experienced physical and sexual violence, have the right to be housed separately from males.They also argue that spaces such as womens refuges should be permitted to refuse males, and in Canada this is a contentious subject. Back in , a transwoman named Kimberly Nixon sought to volunteer as a counsellor for Vancouver Rape Relief, and when she was rejected on the grounds that she had not been born female she took the charity to the British Columbia Human Rights Tribunal. She won the case, and was awarded , for injury to her self-respect and dignity, but the charity sought a judicial review and the case ended up in the Supreme Court, which ruled against Nixon and asserted that the charity was entitled to apply its women-only policy.Lee Lakeman, a pioneering feminist and fierce advocate for abused women, worked at Vancouver Rape Relief for  years. She joined the  for Murphys event in the city and delivered a passionate defence of female-only spaces, warning: ldquoTo those who imagine you can bully us into submission: you are clearly unfamiliar with us.One might imagine that a transgender person taking a rape charity to court would have damaged the cause of transgender rights, but it appears only to have damaged the charity. When a business in the city recently displayed a poster advertising a Rape Relief fundraiser in its window, its owner received a barrage of abuse and negative Facebook reviews. It remains to be seen whether a male taking more than a dozen female beauticians to the British Columbia Human Rights Tribunal claiming discrimination on gender identity grounds ndash after they all refused to wax ldquoher male genitals ndash will be similarly supported by the transgender community and its allies.In the end Murphys event passed without disruption, perhaps unsurprisingly given the muscle on hand to enforce it. By the time the last stragglers left ndash in pairs for their safety, as instructed ndash they found that many of those who had been chanting out in the cold had since abandoned their placards and gone home. However, a local trans activist later argued that by allowing the event to be broadcast online, Vancouver Public Library knowingly took part in ldquopublishing to the internet an incitement to discriminate on the basis of gender identity or expression, an action prohibited by section seven of the Human Rights Code.As the Canadian left continues to eat itself, Scotland is having an in-depth discussion about what it means to be a woman or a man, in law and in our society. The wording of questions on the census might not seem like a vitally important matter, but the Canadian experience shows just how quickly small changes can have far-reaching effects."},{"url":null,"title":"sir-tom-hunter-hails-progress-made-with-west-lothian-new-town-plan-amid-brexit-uncertainty","story":"Sir Tomrsquos West Coast Capital is set to make a multi-million pound investment in coming decades in the , home Winchburgh project in spite of the uncertainty about what Brexit will mean.However, hammering home his view that there should be a second referendum on Brexit, Sir Tom underlined his confidence the investment will pay off whatever storms may lie ahead.Read more: Sir Tom Hunter lamanets utter scandal of Brexit voteldquoPeople say are you investing at the right time  Irsquove no idea butyou sit on your hands and wait for politicians to sort things out yoursquoll never invest a penny, said Sir Tom.He complained that politicians had badly failed in their handling of Brexit.

Ms Aitken still has to get sign off from a full council her party only has minority control of while the women - who are represented iously by Mr Crossrsquos firm Action  Equality Scotland and trade unions the GMB, Unison and Unite - will need to agree their inidual settlements.Given the time and effort that has gone into reaching the agreement, those matters are considered to be formalities, although there could be a small number of cases where further negotiation is required.The bigger issue from the councilrsquos point of view will be raising the necessary finance to ensure it can meet its stated aim of settling all , claims by December this year.It will be no small task. Though Ms Aitken made settling the dispute a priority when she took over from Labourrsquos Frank McAveety in , the previous administration had been so convinced that it could defeat the women through the courts that it made practically no financial provision for a potential settlement.With less than poundm in its contingency fund when Labour left office, the SNP-led council set aside poundm in the   financial year, all of which will now be put towards the settlement.It will also look to extend its existing debt facilities - which at the end of   stood poundm lower than a year previously at pound. billion - and mortgage some of the non-operational buildings held on its behalf by arms- organisation City Property.While raising half a billion pounds should not cause too much of a problem for a council as asset-rich as Glasgow, it is understood that all those financing deals are yet to be done meaning time, more than anything, is going to be of the essence.Then, of course, there will be the future to deal with.The starting point for this entire process was the pay structure put in place in  following an agreement between the Labour administration and the then male-dominated trade unions.Although it was supposed to eradicate an unfair system that had previously seen male workers earn bonuses their female counterparts were not entitled to, in truth all that pay scheme did was lock those bonuses in, perpetuating the inequality in the process.While the poundm settlement will compensate the women for that, the discredited pay system - and so the pay inequality - will remain in place for at least the next two years while work gets under way on devising a new scheme.It is going to be a complicated process, not just because there is an obvious need to get it right this time, but because it is going to require the value of , dferent jobs to be assessed, compared and signed off by both the council and the unions.When it is done, a further settlement will have to be negotiated to make amends for any pay inequalities during the period between this weekrsquos poundm settlement being paid out and the new pay grades taking effect .As Unison Scottish secretary Mike Kirby said when the settlement was agreed on Thursday: ldquoWhile we have made great progress, we still have a lot of work to do.With the council facing bringing thousands of female workersrsquo pay packets into line with those of just a few hundred male staff one thing is for sure: it promises to continue to be a costly business."},{"url":null,"title":"paul-hutcheon-delaying-brexit-is-vital-if-no-deal-departure-is-to-avoided","story":"IT would not take a clairvoyant to predict that the UK is facing the most serious rupture since the second world war in fewer than  days.Here is how it might play out. By mid-March, Theresa May has successfully headed off a softer Brexit proposed by a coalition of MPs and defeated plans for second referendum by exploiting Labour isions.With the country hurtling towards a no-deal departure, the Prime Minister secures concessions from European partners and puts a revised deal in front of the Commons which wins over some Tory doubters.Labour, the Liberal Democrats and the SNP oppose the new draft, but May is confident support from the Democratic Unionist Party and Tory colleagues will suffice. On the day, a hard core of Brexiteers who still have misgivings derail the plan and defeat the Prime Minister. As a result of Westminster paralysis, the UK crashes out of the European Union without a deal on March th.The consequences for the UK economy and society are immediate. Excessive form-filling at ports in the south of England has led to queues of more than  miles in the UK and France. Farmers are panicking about the lack of seasonal harvest workers and warning about the impact of World Trade Organisation rules on exporting their products.Hotels, pubs and restaurants are also complaining about the effect of no deal on their ability to recruit staff and shoppers staring at empty shelves in supermarkets. Car manufacturers announce plans to relocate from the UK and the financial services sector loses vital passporting rights.But it is the strain on the NHS that is causing the most anger. The cost of medicines is to rise sharply and the Health Secretary has conceded that delays will affect the importation of le-saving drugs. All waiting times targets are suspended for five years and thousands of UK nationals in the EU are unsurethey can receive any care.A no-deal Brexit, and the chaos many predict will ensue, is a live prospect because of the terms laid out in the Lisbon Treaty on how to leave the European Union. Once a country invokes Article  ndash the beginning of the withdrawal process ndash the same state has two years to negotiate a deal. The UK departs at the end of March.As we reveal today, key parts of Scottish society have major reservations about the Brexit impasse and the prospect of no deal. Bodies such as the Scottish Trades Union Congress, the Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations and the Scottish Chambers of Commerce support an extension of Article .Civic Scotland is backed up by political muscle. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, as well as Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie and Scottish Greens co-convener Patrick Harvie, are demanding that Brexit is delayed. Collectively these parties represent a clear majority of MSPs at Holyrood. The Prime Minister is under pressure to heed these calls.The argument for an extension is multi-faceted. The  referendum was won by Leave, but even the most passionate Brexiteer would have to concede there is nothing written in the stars about March . Supporters of the intervention believe it is more important to get a good deal than fixate on a specic date in the calendar.There are also political reasons for a delay. The Leave campaignrsquos specic promises have been pored over, scrutinised and mocked, but eurosceptics consistently said the UK would get some form of deal from the EU. Crashing out was never part of the offer ndash regardless of what we have heard in recent days and weeks. An extension would not contradict the verdict delivered in the referendum.But it is the potential economic damage that is fuelling calls for a push back. According to the Confederation of British Industry, no deal would cause GDP to shrink by up to % and put thousands of jobs at risk. Government analysis claimed the GDP hit could be .% over  years. A contraction of this sort would inevitably lead to huge reductions in public spending.Seeking an extension is within the gt of the House of Commons. Senior Labour figures seem broadly sympathetic and the Prime Minister has pointedly refused to rule out a delay.However, as with much of the Brexit melodrama, the key factor is the internal politics of the Tory party. The Prime Minister may recognise the move is inevitable, but she is worried about the cries of betrayal from right-wing colleagues who will see an extension as a plot to stay in the EU. The clock is ticking."},{"url":null,"title":"snp-to-select-candidates-for-european-elections-in-case-brexit-is-delayed","story":"Nicola Sturgeonrsquos party will vet hopefuls in the next few weeks, while the Scottish Greens and Liberal Democrats are also exploring the idea in light of the current Brexit chaos.A senior SNP source said the move would send a ldquopowerful signal that scrapping Brexit is becoming a serious option.The UK is set to leave the EU on March th, with or without a deal on the terms of departure.The next elections to the European Parliament are scheduled for May, but the UK voters will not elect any MEPs as the country is scheduled to have left the EU.However, given that the UK Governmentrsquos draft withdrawal plan was comprehensively rejected by MPs last year, a range of options have moved into view.These include a no deal Brexit, which will occurMPs fail to raty an agreement struck with EU negotiators, and a second referendum.It is also possible for the UK to delay Brexit by requesting an extension to the Article  process which will lead to the UK leaving in March.And, as a result of a court case brought about by Scottish politicians, the UK can cancel Brexit by revoking Article .One of the lsquodelayrsquo models is extending the leave date by a few months, by which point the new round MEPs will have taken their seats.It would also be possible, but politically harder, to extend Article  for a substantially longer period.At a recent meeting of the SNPrsquos national executive committee , senior councillor Chris McEleny, who has contested his partyrsquos depute leadership election, is said to have raised the issue of the next European elections.It is understood he said the SNP, which favours a second referendum on leaving the EU, should select MEP candidates because it is possible Brexit may not go ahead.A source said: ldquoChris said thatArticle  is revoked or extended then Scotland will still require representation in the European Parliament, and so it would be diligent to have candidates in place.Keith Brown, the SNPrsquos Depute Leader, confirmed the move to this newspaper:ldquoThe SNP is open to candidate applications for the  European Parliament election.

Anna Fowlie, chief executive of the Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations , which has around , members, said:ldquoAfter two years, we find ourselves on the brink of exiting the EU without a withdrawal agreement that both the UK Parliament and the EU can sign up to.ldquoThere is therefore no choice but to seek agreement with the EU to extend Article  to allow time for a second EU referendum to take place.Liz Cameron, director and chief executive of the Scottish Chamber of Commerce, said: ldquoThe rationale for a delay to the Article  timeline is growing each and every day in our business communities.ldquoAn extension to Article  would, first and foremost, avoid a no deal outcome on March , but it would also acknowledge that neither business nor government are prepared for such a scenario.Colin Borland, director of Devolved Nations at the Federation of Small Businesses , which has around , members, said: ldquoThis longer window could give Scottish business a much-needed opportunity to prepare while taking the fever out of the public debate.And David Watt, executive director of the Institute of Directors in Scotland, said business leaders are ldquovery concerned about a no-deal Brexit: ldquoWith all of this in mind, the inevitable conclusion is to extend Article . It may be the only option to ensure a deal and a reasonable transition period.Grahame Smith, general secretary of the Scottish Trades Union Congress, which represents around , trade unionists, also backs an extension, as does GMB Scotland Secretary Gary Smith.Professor Sir Anton Muscatelli, principal of Glasgow University, is also strongly in favour of hitting the pause button as a way of delivering another referendum.\"With the Prime Ministerrsquos deal dead and Parliament in gridlock, there is only one way out ndash that is to request an extension to Article , and call a Peoplersquos Vote, he said.He added that an extension would ldquoappear the only opportunity to avoid the chaos of a No Deal outcome.In todayrsquos Herald on Sunday, the senior civic figures are joined by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie and Scottish Green co-convener Patrick Harvie.It also comes after three former Prime Ministers ndash John Major, Tony Blair and Gordon Brown ndash called on Article  to be either extended or revoked.Major, who was a Tory PM between  and , has said revoking Article  is the ldquoonly sensible course, as a no-deal Brexit would be ldquomorally reprehensible.Blair said he would be discussing the terms of an extension with the EUhe was still in Government, while Brown called for Brexit to be delayed by a year.Mayrsquos minority administration is opposed to an extension, but the Prime Minister has not ruled it out.However, the move would anger her pro-Brexit backbenchers and likely lead to further Cabinet resignations.Boris Johnson, the Brexiteer who quit as Mayrsquos Foreign Secretary in protest at one version of her deal, warned against an extension:\"It would be so utterly pathetic that I do think it would not only

wrist, and it said her friend suffered cuts to the knee in the crash.The newspaper reports Ms Fairweather, a mother-of-two, has told family and friends she is unhappy with how the incident has been

ldquowell-wishes with the injured women and appeared to have no lasting problems following the collision on the busy A-road, a palace spokeswoman said on Friday.A source said on the same day: ldquoThe

the incident will be investigated and any appropriate action taken.ldquoWe are aware of the public interest in this case, however, as with any other investigation it would be inappropriate to speculate on the causes of the collision until an investigation is carried out.Retired NHS worker Victoria Warne told The Sun she spoke to the duke at the scene of the crash as she looked after the injured occupants of the Kia.The -year-old, from Norfolk, said: ldquoThe passenger from the other car told me, lsquoI always wanted to meet a royal ndash but not this wayrsquo.She said the duke asked after the welfare of the Kia occupants, adding: ldquoHe looked so worried and told me, lsquoIrsquom such a foolrsquo.Her -year-old husband Roy helped the stricken duke out of his car, and he told The Sun Philip was overheard telling police he had been ldquodazzled by the sun.Nick Freeman, the lawyer dubbed Mr Loophole, said the duke could be prosecuted for driving without due care and attentionhe was deemed to have made a mistake.But he added: ldquoIf the sun was so low and right in your eyes, sometimes itrsquos impossible to see, and that may well have been the case, and that would afford him a defence.The duke, who retired from public duties in  but remains active, could also avoid prosecution by surrendering his licence, according to the lawyer known for representing celebrity clients like David Beckham.The crash happened as Philiprsquos Freelander pulled out of a side road on to a stretch of the A which was earmarked by the local authority for possible safety measures.The duke

Mrs Mayrsquos remarkable achievement of winning a party leadership vote then a vote of confidence while simultaneously heading the first UK Government in history to be found in contempt of Parliament and suffering the biggest-ever defeat is enough to make anyonersquos head spin.So plotting the next few weeks and months will be dficult, but there are a few gravitational forces that cannot be denied. Firstly, the clock is ticking. Unless something  actively happens, the UK and Scotland with it will leave the EU at pmon March . All this ldquotherersquos no majority in the Commons for No Deal is entirely meaningless, much like the iceberg did not actually bear the Titanic any ill will ndash exit will happen unless they actively do something to stop it.Secondly, Mayrsquos ldquodeal is only to exit. The future is dealt with only in an aspirational Political Declaration which is not worthless, but not binding either. So all the bumping of gums by MPs about Norway plus, Canada minus or upside-down Lichtenstein is all so much puff ndash these negotiations will only start after the exit. If we exit with a deal then a transition period kicks in where EU law will continue to apply as we try to negotiate the future relationship. Basically wersquoll have as little idea of the future, except wersquoll be outside the EU.SoBrexit happens, a ldquosoft Brexit where the UK remains in the single market and the customs union is undoubtedly the least damaging aspiration. This is why the Scottish Government and others have proposed it as a potential ldquoless bad option in the spirit of trying to find solutions, but they have also been clear EU membership is the best option.My concern is that there may well be a majority in the House of Commons for a Norway-style aspiration, but that it will be as unsustainable as all the other pipe dreams and in reality offers no stability at all. It would not withstand its first crisis, which would come all the harder because by then we would have lost the chance to avert it, having left the EU.So letrsquos take a look at it. EFTArsquos own website explains that ldquothe EEA EFTA states have little influence on the decision-making phase on the EU side. Instead, they focus on ldquodecision shaping. This involves informal consultations, attendance at some committees, and submission of views in generally short ldquocomments papers.This is not nothing, but it is light years from the power we have now in council and the European Parliament, and votes for ministers and the UKrsquos  MEPs.The term ldquoVassal State is overblown and grievously offensive to many EU states who actually were until recently, but the reality is that the amount of influence we would have is really very limited. From day one the deal would be ripe for destabilisation by unsatisfied Brexit ultras and their allies.The current members of the EEA and EFTA have spent many decades building up how it works they know the compromises and the shortcomings. The UK political class and administrative machinery are wholly unprepared for the reality that being a rule-taker would bring.You can imagine the mischief the Brexit ultras would make. In a world where outrage can be whipped up over rules on lightbulbs, kettles and toasters, theyrsquod be braying for vetoes to be used at the slightest hint of a controversial EU law. Of course, they would move on to attacking membership of the EEA on this basis.Some already see the EEA as a way to gradually move to a hard Brexit by stealth, so eventhe arrangement survived first contact it is unlikely it would be remotely stable in the medium to long-term.Itrsquos a measure of just how damaging Brexit is that the very best alternative is still much worse than EU membership.

An extension to Article  would, first and foremost, avoid a no-deal outcome on March , but it would also acknowledge that neither business nor government are prepared for such a scenario.

Steam or heat the haggis in the microwave to soften the meat. Gradually add the beaten egg, a little at a time, to bind the mixture.. Prepare the sauce by reducing the cream and whisky by half in a pan over a medium heat. Once cooled, add the mustard. Mix well and set aside.. Remove the pasta dough from the fridge and roll it out on a lightly floured work surface. Divide the dough into two pieces.. Set the rollers of the pasta machine to their widest setting. Dust the first piece of dough lightly with flour and run it once through the machine. Fold in half and run it through the machine again. Do this on the first setting at least  or  times as this will give the pasta a firmer texture.. Change the rollers to the next setting and run the dough through it. Keep changing to the next setting and working the pasta through the rollers until it is thin but not transparent.. Next, fill the ravioli. Lay the sheet of dough on a lightly floured surface. Place one tablespoon of the haggis filling every . to cm apart. Lightly brush or spray the exposed edges with water. Fold the sheet in half, over the filling, and seal around each mound, pressing out the air pockets with you fingertips. Cut between the filling and press the edges to seal them completely..

GDP would fall substantially and lower revenues would usher in a type of austerity politics that would make the last decade feel like the good old days.Unless a resolution is found, the UK is on the verge of a national catastrophe. Our Westminster politicians would never be forgiven for putting citizens through such hardship.As we report today, key bodies in civic Scotland are demanding that Article  is extended so that more time can be devoted to getting this decision right. These calls should be heeded.There may not be an obvious majority for a specic Brexit plan, but most MPs are horried by the prospect of a no deal departure.

Real jobs here are scarce.Under Mugabersquos rule, the rate of unemployment rose to more than %, forcing many people to eke out a living by hawking on the streets, giving rise to Mbarersquos Mupedzanhamo Market, which, loosely translated from the Shona language, means ldquoend poverty.ldquoMbare is a tough place to live, surely you can see that for yourself just standing here, said Joseph Masenda, while his sister nearby filled a bucket with water from an open communal pipe at the foot of a block of dilapidated redbrick flats where many of the windows were broken or boarded up.ldquoWe need change, big change, andEmmerson Mnangagwa cannot bring it, then some new leader has to, insisted Masenda, as we stood talking in the township last year just before the elections many Zimbabweans hoped and believed were the beginning of a new political dawn.At long last, they thought the authoritarianism, corruption, human rights abuses and widespread poverty that had plagued their lives for years might finally be over.The man many pinned their hopes on was Mugabersquos fellow Zanu-PF party member Emmerson Dambudzo Mnangagwa, or ldquoED as he is more commonly known here.However, it was perhaps Mnangagwarsquos other nickname, ldquoThe Crocodile, given to him for surviving a turbulent political career with a mixture of cunning and ruthlessness, that provided the real clue as to where the now president was intent on taking the country.For over these past days, ldquoThe Crocodile has snapped back old style, as he cracks down on street protests sparked by a % hike in fuel prices that has made petrol in this economically shattered country now the worldrsquos most expensive.According to president Mnangagwa, the increase in prices was meant to ease the impact of the fuel shortage on Zimbabwersquos ailing economy.But Zimbabweans, already squeezed by the high cost of living, were having none of it. While most heeded a nationwide stay-at-home protest, others took to the streets, where they were met with force by Zimbabwersquos security forces in Harare and in the southwestern city of Bulawayo last week.Since then, graphic reports have emerged of security forces targeting activists and labour leaders, while the government also imposed a ldquototal internet shutdown in what critics called an attempt to hide evidence of the true nature of the crackdown.On Friday, badly injured people streamed into a hospital in Harare, after assaults by soldiers and paramilitaries.While the government says three people died during the unrest, lawyers and activists say the toll was much higher and mass arrests were used to quell the street demonstrations.On January , Zimbabwersquos Doctors for Human Rights released a statement saying ldquohundreds shot, tens estimated dead in rampant rights violations across Zimbabwe.Their assessment included reports of  patients treated for gunshot and blunt trauma wounds. Human rights group Amnesty International also reported that at least eight people have been killed. The government and media, meanwhile, also accused the opposition Movement for Democratic Change , trade unions and civil society groups backed by foreign funders of orchestrating the protests as part of a campaign to undermine the government and elevate the MDCrsquos leader, Nelson Chamisa, into office. Both the US and Germany were named. Such accusations though are par for the course when the Zimbabwean government faces protests. Based on past experience, it seems unlikely it will supply compelling evidence to support such claims.ldquoOur country is going through one of the most trying periods in its history, the Zimbabwe Catholic Bishopsrsquo Conference said in a sweeping statement lamenting the governmentrsquos ldquointolerant handling of dissent and its failure to halt the economic collapse.Among the  or so people arrested and charged by magistrates was pastor Evan Mawarire, a rights activist who started the popular ldquoThis Flag movement, and rose to prominence as a critic of Mugabersquos rule and led a national protest in .ldquoI cannot tell you how heartbreaking it is. We thought we had a new country and a new way of doing things. None of what I am being accused of is what I have done at all, Mawarire told reporters after being arrested for ldquoinciting violence on social media.ldquoI did nothing of that nature. If we have true justice, letrsquos see it at play, said Mawarire, who will now stand trial on more serious charges of subverting the government.While it remains too early to assess the true scale and severity of Zimbabwersquos crisis or whether itrsquos a warning of big shts in the countryrsquos volatile political environment, activists and civil society organisers who witnessed the violence say the crackdown appears more widespread and severe than those in the past decade.They described widespread beatings by security forces, a police raid on a hospital where those assaulted were receiving treatment, and the military taking over a police station where protesters were detained. All spoke on condition of anonymity, citing concerns for their safety.ldquoThe crackdown is profound hellip and brutal, and we cannot work out what the endgame is, one Zimbabwean health worker was quoted by Foreign Policy magazine as saying.Itrsquos all a far cry from the positive pronouncement made by Mnangagwa last year when I visited the country and he declared: ldquoZimbabwe is now open for business.Walking the streets of Harare back then I couldnrsquot help noticing the number of newspapers on stands praising Mnangagwa.One prominent paper, The Sunday Mail, applauded the presidentrsquos then recent visit to China.ldquoED s with a bagful, it proclaimed in a reference to a deal Mnangagwa was then brokering to secure billion of pounds worth of investment for projects in Zimbabwe.At the time it seemed that Mnangagwa could do no wrong, and concerns over his ability to deliver didnrsquot seem to trouble many Zimbabweans other than those who saw him as a chip off the Zanu-PF block and just another part of the political old guard.Even the European Unionwas prepared to give him the benefit of the doubt.One morning during my visit I attended Mbarersquos Stodart Community Hall, where the EUrsquos Commissioner for International Development, Neven Mimica, who had just met Mnangagwa, signed an agreement with Zimbabwean officials that would see new EU-funded programmes worth pound million launched to improve peoplersquos access to health services and enhance their livelihoods.Mimicarsquos was the first high-level EU visit to Zimbabwe in almost a decade and spoke volumes about the EUrsquos hopes for the country, given that its financial support came with conditions requiring improvement in Zimbabwersquos democratic process and transition under Mnangagwa. ldquoThe EU has always been a reliable partner of the Zimbabwean people and it stands ready to accompany Zimbabwe in its process of change, said Mimica.ldquoWe do not want to be a passive partner in this process, he added, stressing that the EU and others were watching Zimbabwersquos forthcoming elections carefully and that reforms must be made and checks carried out that that process is underway for EU financial support to be maintained.Where now, one wonders in light of events over the past few days, does that leave the EU and wider international community when it comes to supporting Zimbabwe  For the time being, no-one doubts that Zimbabwe still desperately needs that support in both urban and rural communities.Venture out from Hararersquos bustle into the rural hinterland and the true fragility of this beautul countryrsquos economic stability and faltering steps towards democracy quickly becomes apparent.Itrsquos worrying then to hear the EU over the past days issuing a statement noting the ldquodisproportionate use of force by security personnel and the UN appealing for restraint by the Zimbabwean authorities.There are clearly real fears now that Mnangagwa is not the democratic reformer many in Zimbabwe had yearned for when Mugabe was ousted in  after his  years in power.Some have even gone as far as to suggest that what is currently being witnessed is the ldquothe open militarisation of the state.ldquoPeople wanted to see Mugabe go, but they didnrsquot realise that they were actually creating a bigger monster, says Alex Magaisa, a Zimbabwean lawyer and professor at the University of Kent.ldquoThe military is now very much in control and very powerful.In some ways, perhaps, the latest unrest should come as no real surprise. Anger at the government has been steadily brewing since those hopeful days after Mugabersquos overthrow. Even on my last visit to the country its economic woes were plain to see.Everywhere people complained of prices in shops soaring, retailers were closing down and queues for petrol were ening as the country struggled to juggle payments for competing import priorities.Control over the countryrsquos fuel supply, which triggered the current unrest, remains in the hands of Mnangagwarsquos ruling ZANU-PF party, and the huge financial benefits that come with it are reportedly causing factional rivalry.There is widespread public speculation that the shortages are caused by inter-elite squabbles or even deliberately engineered. This sense that Mnangagwarsquos hand controls all was reinforced over the past few days as Zimbabweans found themselves without internet access after the government ordered the countryrsquos biggest mobile operator to shut down service again.After several hours networks were restored but social-media s remained blocked, meaning that people have not been able to access any social-media sites such as WhatsApp, Twitter and Facebook throughout the week.Itrsquos all a long way from barely  months ago when the coup that forced Mugabe from office created a mood of optimism that also played out online.Like many ordinary Zimbabweans, Joy Mviro, a young mother I met last year outside the Edith Opperman Maternity Centre in the heart of Mbare, was adamant that things were changing for the better. Just , Joy still had most of her le ahead of her, as did her six-month-old daughter Keisha, whom she has brought to the clinic as part of a series of regular check-ups since the baby was born #around the time that Mugabe was overthrown.ldquoWe can now talk openly, she told me confidently that day when we met. ldquoBefore Mr Mugabe was kicked out, I would have thought twice about talking to a journalist or answering their questions, but not now, Joy insisted.How sad it is now, then, that such optimism has largely evaporated in light of recent events unfolding on Hararersquos streets. Ten years or so ago, in a small village north of Bulawayo, during one of my first visits to Zimbabwe, I met a -year-old great-grandmother called Golidem.Sitting on the floor of her hut, surrounded by a few meagre possessions and lovingly cradling her one-month-old great-grandson Nkosina in her arms, she talked eloquently of another time in Zimbabawe, a bygone age when dialogue, not ision, made the country a great beacon of hope across Africa.Golidem will have passed on by now but Zimbabwersquos drive to make a better society goes on. Zimbabweans are known for their patience, but just as it ran out with Mugabe so now it is also running out with Mnangagwa."},{"url":null,"title":"brexit-what-might-happen-next","story":"The Withdrawal Agreement was subject of the greatest parliamentary humiliation of a serving prime minister in the modern era, but Mrs May survived a vote of no confidence  hours later.Here we look at what could happen next:ndash Theresa May resigns: While the PM has said she will not lead the Tories into another general election, she has consistently ruled out quitting before Brexit.ndash Plan B is activated: The Prime Minister has yet to reveal what her fallback position is. Under the terms of an amendment tabled by Dominic Grieve and controversially passed by MPs, she has until Monday to present a new plan to the Commons.While the details of this Plan B are not clear, the chairman of the Eurosceptic European Research Group, Jacob Rees-Mogg, wrote in the Mail on Sunday that it was possible for Mrs May to get a deal through the Commonsshe persuaded the EU to show flexibility on the backstop and pound billion orce bill.ldquoIf I had to choose between no deal and Mrs Mayrsquos original accord, I would have no hesitation of opting for no-deal Brexit but even Mrs Mayrsquos deal would be better than not leaving at all, he wrote.ndash Itrsquos good to talk: Mrs May has offered to talk to opposition parties and groups with dferent desires and views to find consensus in Parliament. But her refusal to abandon no-deal Brexit and other leadersrsquo refusal to speak properly until she does suggests one party will need to cede some ground.Also writing in the Mail on Sunday, the chief Brexit representative for the European Parliament, Guy Verhofstadt, said: ldquoIf necessary, this document could still be enhanced in the next coming weeks.ldquoBritish politicians will always find an open door to do that, but they must act soon.ldquoThis will only happenpolitical parties in the UK start to work together.ldquoSuch a cross-party approach is not natural to the adversarial UK political system, but itrsquos time to change course and to put the national interest ahead of narrow party political interests.ndash Confidence vote .: The opposition can in theory call as many of these votes as they like, although the Lib Dems have said they will not support another as they believe it is a waste of time. Such a vote could trigger a general election but this is very much the nuclear option for Tory rebels and the DUP have already said they will not vote with Labour, so it appears to be a forlorn hope.ndash Back to Brussels for more talks: The EU has said repeatedly that it will not reopen negotiations on the Withdrawal Agreement, and ldquoassurances on the Irish border backstop were dismissed by Brexiteers earlier this week. There is little time and no clear indication what more the EU can or wants to offer. France has stepped up its no-deal preparations.ndash Asking for an extension of Article : Mrs May has previously insisted almost to the point of foot-stamping that Britain will leave the EU on March , and a U-turn here would enrage already puce Brexiteers.But writing in the Observer, Unison general secretary Dave Prentis said: ldquoThe PM has pushed us dangerously close to the exit door with perilously little left on the clock.ldquoSo itrsquos vital that immediate steps be taken to extend article .ldquoNot to stop Brexit, but to ensure that therersquos time to force a change of government, or find a solution parliament can back.ndash Halting Article : A court case last year ruled that, while all  other EU states have to agree to extend the Article  process of leaving, the UK can unilaterally reverse it. Neither the Tories nor Labour support a halt but Philip Hammond reportedly told business leaders in a conference call on Wednesday that a bill being rustled up by backbenchers would have this as its aim.ndash A second referendum: Labour members at conference left the door open to supporting a new vote on leavingthe party could not trigger a general election. Mr Corbyn was applauded by Labour activists when he pointed this out in a speech on Thursday. But he also indicated he would rather leave with a Labour-flavoured Withdrawal Agreement.STOP THIS NOW: voices tell Herald on Sunday why we should delay BrexitFormer attorney general Dominic Grieve wrote in the Sunday Times: ldquoI have made no secret of my support for the Peoplersquos Vote campaign but it is important to recognise that this idea may well gain support only at the end of a process when every possible Brexit option has been explored.ldquoI do not doubt that legislating for a new referendum is a dficult decision and the last resort for many MPs.ldquoWe must, however, pursue this debate with courtesy, listening to those of other views and finding areas of common interest, but keeping our own preference in mind. I am convinced on grounds both of common sense and the national interest that a new public vote will be helpful to resolving this crisis.ndash No-deal Brexit: If Theresa May loses and Parliament cannot come together behind an alternative, the UK will leave the European Union on March  without a deal. This is something to either be afraid of, or not afraid of, depending on your view of Brexit."},{"url":null,"title":"a labour of love and dream come true for peterhead director jon","story":"Itrsquos the week before Christmas and Blue Toon filmmaker Jon S. Baird is sitting in a hotel lobby in London, apologising in advance for any trad jazz that might be filtering down the phone line. ldquoJust so you know, theyrsquore piping it through the walls itrsquos not my taste, he says, his Aberdeenshire accentcutting through the background din.As it happens, hersquos been spending a lot of time in hotels over the last couple of months. His new film, the late-years Laurel  Hardy biopic Stan  Ollie, is currently part of this seasonrsquos awards circuit, with a Golden Globe nomination already in the bag for John C Reillyrsquos transformative turn as Oliver Hardy. That means Baird has also been on the campaign trail, zipping back-and-forth between London, Los Angeles and New York to do QAs with Reilly and co-star Steve Cooganand getting influential industry heavyweights to introduce screenings. Just a few days earlier, for instance, Baird found himself in the surreal position of having Martin Scorsese introduce the film in New York.ldquoHa! Irsquom glad you picked up on that it saves me doing my usual name-dropping, he says, with a self-deprecating laugh.Turns out Scorsese is something of a friend and mentor. They first met three-and-a-half years ago after Baird made the Irvine Welsh adaptation Filth.Scorsese was looking for directors to work on his and Mick Jaggerrsquos short-lived HBO drama Vinyl and he tapped Baird to helm one of the episodes. Baird remembers meeting him for the first time and telling him he was the reason he got into film-making.ldquoBy the look on his face you could tell he sort of hears this all the time. He was probably thinking I was going to mention Taxi Driver or Raging Bull or Goodfellas, but then I said that King of Comedy was the one that really got me interested in film-making and he instantly became engaged on a really intense level.ldquoI donrsquot think many people pick that out as one of his best movies.data-src\"https:res. jpress image fetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.ellontimes webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Colin Clark MP, UK Government Minister Lord Duncan and cllr Gillian Owen at the opening event\"  New centre opened in BalmedieviewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\" data-src\"https:res. jpress image fetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.ellontimes webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"David Cook , Cllr Gwyneth Petrie, Cllr Gillian Owen, Cllr Anne Simpson, Cllr Anne Allan, Cllr Iris Walker and Cllr Anne Stirling \"  , Cllr Gwyneth Petrie, Cllr Gillian Owen, Cllr Anne Simpson, Cllr Anne Allan, Cllr Iris Walker and Cllr Anne Stirling \"  Unit to breathe new le into council services viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\"ldquoFrom that moment, he kind of took me under his wing and ever since then, whenever I go to New York I go round to his house and wersquoll have a cup of tea or Irsquoll go to the edit and hersquoll show me stuff from the latest film hersquos been working on. It is like a boyhood dream.Of course, Scorsese is also a walking encyclopaedia of film history, so the fact that Baird has made a film about arguably the greatest cinematic comedy double act of all time must have made him a good person to have in his corner. ldquoHe did mentor me on Stan  Ollie, confirms Baird, who specically sought his technical advice on how to shoot the moviersquos dazzling opening scene: an extended one-take tracking shot following Laurel and Hardy at the peak of their career as they walk through a studio backlot in .ldquoWe only had one day to shoot that because we were in Pinewood and Star Wars had taken all the stages, says Baird. ldquoIt was unbelievable. ldquoWe planned it like a military operation.If the sequence owes something to the cinematic craft of the Copacabana nightclub scene in Scorsesersquos Goodfellas, it also feels like a sly homage to the opening shot of Robert Altmanrsquos Hollywood satire The Player, immediately setting this up as more of a bittersweet look at what happens to movie stars when the glare of the spotlight fades.When Stan  Ollie cuts to  years later, for instance, the protagonists are in a very dferent place.Fondly remembered by the public, but out of step with contemporary tastes, theyrsquore unable to secure even aphone call from producers as they embark on what feels, at first, like a grin-and-bear-it tour of Britainrsquos regional music halls, performing their old routines up and down the country, including in Glasgow, where the Lancashire-born Stan Laurel spent the latter part of his childhood and secured his first professional gig, aged , at the Panopticon.ldquoI didnrsquot really know about Laurelrsquos connection to Scotland until I started doing this film, says Baird, who has fond memories of his own childhood love of watching Laurel and Hardy films on TV in the late s and early s.ldquoTherersquos a picture of me as an eight year-old that my mum still has of me dressed as Stan Laurel at the school fancy dress party, he says.The enduring appeal of Laurel and Hardy is something the filmrsquos melancholic plot zeroes in on and though Reillyrsquos performance is justly winning the lionrsquos share of the acclaim, Cooganrsquos take on Laurel as the quiet, professionally-minded workhorse is perhaps the more relatable.It certainly seems more applicable to Bairdrsquos own career. Having grown up in a fishing town with no family connection to the arts world , he kept his own film-making ambitions secret, moving to London and working in telesales until a friend who worked for a newspaper tipped him off to an entry level job at a production company about to be advertised in the recruitment section.ldquoHe told them there was no space to run it that week and gave me the number. ldquoSo I phoned them up, had an interview, got the job and started the next week, by which point the advert had run and they got  applications.ldquoI know, because I had to st through all the mail!Even now, it still feels like becoming a director was a bit of a pipe dream.ldquoBut I think that made me work a lot harder. I had to. It was either work hard and put everything into it or it was never going to happen. ldquoSo Irsquom glad now, but there were a lot of dark days getting here.Jonrsquos formative years were spent in Peterhead. Educated at the local academy, he worked for his fatherrsquos roofing company and ndash like so many other young loons ndash also worked at the port.He even did work experience at the Buchanie!Despite all this, however, he harboured dferent ambitions ndash he wanted to see his name in lights.In an interview with the Buchanie in , he said: ldquoMy uncle lived in Hampshire and we used to visit him twice a year. On the way we would stop in London and go to a theatre production, usually a musical. My dad used to love musicals. By the age of  Irsquod seen everything ndash you name it Irsquod seen it.ldquoWhen I came out of those theatre productions I had this incredible euphoria. I thought when I was older I want to do something that makes people feel like that. ldquoPeterhead is not a place you can really come from and do that. Itrsquos not achievable.

During that time, hundreds of thousands of people have volunteered their time providing the RSPB with over eight million hours of monitoring garden birds.This year’s event takes place on ,  and  January .The public is asked to spend just one hour watching and recording the birds in their garden or local green space, then send their results to the RSPB.Close to half-a-million people join in the Birdwatch every year and, in Aberdeenshire, the most commonly recorded bird last year was the house sparrow, followed by the starling, chaffinch, blackbird, blue tit, and goldfinch.Over the last  years,  million birds have been counted giving the RSPB an astonishing amount of insight into how our wildle is faring.Mike Clarke, RSPB Chief Executive, said: “Everyone has a role to play in saving nature and protecting our wildle. Big Garden Birdwatch participants have made a signicant contribution to monitoring garden bird numbers over the past four decades. Those taking part work together as part of a community with thousands of other Big Garden Birdwatchers to help the RSPB’s work to protect birds, other wildle and the places they live.“Reaching  years is a huge achievement and shows just how passionate people across the UK are about their wildle.The survey started as a winter activity for our youth members. It’s now the largest garden wildle survey in the world and appeals to both children and adults because it’s an enjoyable, easy, inclusive activity that anyone can do and a great opportunity to connect with nature.” As well as counting birds, the RSPB is once again asking participants to log some of the other wildle they have seen throughout the year. This year, people are being asked to look out for badger, fox, grey squirrel, red squirrel, muntjac deer, roe deer, frog and toad.To take part in the Big Garden Birdwatch , watch the birds in your garden or local park for one hour at some point over the three days. Only count the birds that land, not those flying over. Note the highest number of each bird species you see at any one time – not the total you see in the hour.For your free th anniversary Big Garden Birdwatch pack, which includes a bird identication chart, plus RSPB shop voucher and advice to help you attract wildle to your garden, text BIRD to  or visit www.rspb.org.uk birdwatch.data-src\"https:res. jpress image fetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Out on the ice...The Polar Academys pupils lead the expedition and decide their own route.

He will be  next month but still visits schools and other groups to give slideshow presentations about his war experiences. Here we reproduce an interview with Don which was published in the Groat in June  to mark the th anniversary of the D-Day landings. Don flew to Normandy twice on D-Day, first dropping paratroops and then a glider with more troops and equipment.*WHEN the grey dawn broke over Normandy on June , , Don Mason had already made the first of his two contributions to the momentous events of D-Day. The young airman was part of the six-man crew of a modied Stirling bomber that had dropped  paratroops and their equipment at Ranville under cover of darkness. Heading for home, the Stirling came under fire from anti-aircraft guns on the French coast but ed unscathed to its base at Fairford in Gloucestershire. In the early evening the same crew were back over Normandy, this time towing a glider with more troops destined for the original dropping zone ndash and by this stage, almost  hours after the start of the Allies seaborne invasion, the full enormity of Operation Overlord was clear to see. \"It looked like a scene out of a nightmare,\" Don now recalls.Don had been fascinated with aeroplanes since his childhood in Worcestershire. As a young boy he once walked four miles with his family to see a travelling circus which featured a plane of Great War vintage Don could only gaze in wonderment as the flying machine entertained the crowds, and he resolved that one day he would fly an aircraft of his own. It was an ambition that would be fulfilled with the onset of World War Two.Although just  at the time of D-Day, Don had already clocked up numerous operations as a bomber pilot. He had been severely injured in a fighter attack over Germany in  and was declared medically unfit. After being reinstated on appeal, he was retrained as a radio observer.\"We had been in No.  Group Bomber Command,\" says Don, who moved to Thurso in the s but whose Caithness connection goes back to  when he flew Blenheims out of Wick. \"The whole squadron were suddenly lted out of Bomber Command and put into  Group, airborne support, which was a completely new role because wed never worked with paratroops or the like before.\"He was now in  Squadron, flying a modied version of the Stirling four-engined heavy bomber: the Mk IV troop-carrier and glider tug. \"We had to do a lot of exercises to get used to that aeroplane and to get used to dropping troops and towing gliders, which obviously was a dferent ball game altogether... it required a lot of dferent techniques.\"And it was necessary with any airborne group to drop them accurately in as tight a bunch as possible ndash therefore youd got to operate at a low height and also not get them scattered, so timing was important.\"There developed a formation flying technique which was called starboard echelon, so youve got two lines of aircraft flying parallel to one another. We had to practise these on group exercises, and a number of things happened: tow ropes broke, gliders went down in dferent places.\"On one group exercise we were flying along in this starboard echelon formation and there were literally hundreds of us ndash it wasnt just my squadron, it was a number of dferent squadrons ndash and suddenly an aircraft in the port line veered straight across into an aircraft in the starboard line and they both went down in flames. We lost two aircraft and two crews, just like that, on an exercise. Those are the things that stick in the mind.\"That tragic accident occurred on May , , in one of the last group exercises before D-Day. It was becoming clear that a big operation was imminent, one that would have major repercussions for the course of the war.\"Obviously we knew something was happening,\" Don says, \"because we were practising with troops and gliders and whatever. But we werent aware, of course, until the th of June when we were briefed originally.\"The invasion was scheduled initially for June  but was postponed for  hours because of the weather. \"Before that we had the indications of the airfield being closed off and we werent allowed to leave ndash we were shut in, the mail was censored.\"Paratroops of the th Airborne Division had been arriving at Fairford from the middle of May, and glider pilots were gathering there too as the security arrangements became ever tighter. The troops camped out on the airfield and Don remembers: \"One thing that struck me was that most of them were not very big men but the amount of equipment they carried was phenomenal, with kitbags full of gear strapped to their legs. The other thing that struck me as quite remarkable was they were all carrying water bottles full of white rum!\"Stirling LJ  took off from Fairford at . hours on June  in what was code-named Operation Tonga, with Don as wireless operator air gunner. On board were  fully equipped paratroops and the BBC correspondent Guy Byam.Dons chief recollection of that night flight over the English Channel is the sight of vast numbers of landing craft and other vessels in the assembly area ndash which was known as \"Piccadilly Circus\" ndash as they awaited the signal to head for the beaches.\"We were briefed to drop precisely at a time and place,\" he explains. \"It was important to get the troops on the ground in a bunch, not scattered. We were only over mid-Channel so we did an orbit ndash that was a bit dicey with so many aircraft about, all flying in one direction, and us crossing the stream. It all went to build up the tension.\"Finally, at . hours, the troops were released at Ranville, where they were to set up a homing beacon to aid following aircraft and also to assist in holding bridges over the nearby river Orne after the seaborne invasion had begun. Don remembers the red light in the fuselage turning to green on reaching the dropping zone. \"They all had to go together. Naturally some hesitated on the lip of the door ndash but they had all got to go.\"In the lead-up to the drop, there had been a close encounter between the Stirling and a group of paratroops released by a nearby Dakota. \"He released his troops and they came past us and we flew right through and didnt touch one,\" says Don.\"There was no flak at all over Normandy but then we had to fly in a northerly direction towards the Pas de Calais after dropping our troops, which was a feint because the Germans expected us to attack the Pas de Calais rather than anywhere . So we flew on a northerly track and we experienced flak around Le Havre and Dieppe, and then when we exited France towards Beachy Head we got some light flak on the coast, but there wasnt a great deal of resistance.\"It was a dferent matter altogether when Don and his crew-mates embarked on their second operation of D-Day, code-named Mallard.This time their Stirling had a Horsa glider in tow, containing more troops bound for the Ranville area along with an armoured jeep, four anti-tank guns and ammunition. Take-off time was . hours and the glider was to be released at ..Don remembers the scene vividly: \"The Channel was still littered with shipping but when we approached the Normandy coast it was a chaotic mass of ships and landing craft and smoke and explosions. It looked like a scene out of a nightmare, really. And, of course, as we went over land and approached the landing zone there was a lot more activity and a lot more flak.\"You couldnt tow a glider above  knots so it was fairly slow. You were low because you didnt want the glider to be shot down before it could get down to land. So obviously a big aircraft like the Stirling, with a ft wingspan or thereabouts, and a Horsa glider behind it, was a good target. In fact, all  of our aircraft were hit by anti-aircraft fire.\"Indeed one of those planes was shot down and crash-landed into the beachhead. The airmen were uninjured and got away for a while before being picked up by a German patrol.Subsequently the German position where they were held prisoner was captured and the crew ed to base.Reflecting on the chaos and confusion of D-Day, does Don recall feeling scared by what was happening around him  \"Well, everybodys scared ndash I dont care what anyone says,\" he replies. \"If youre not scared you dont perform, but its discipline and training that takes you through. You do reach a point of no .\"This is rude, I know, but its what I call s**t or bust. You go on and do it. Its a matter of accepting whats going on and just dealing with it, and doing the job youre supposed to do.\"Its not a question of bravery. Im very suspicious when people say, Oh, youre a brave man, or Youve got a lot of courage. You react to circumstances. Its a question of training and discipline and doing your job, without really recognising the probability of being killed.\"And I think to some extent the unorm protects you ndash you feel less vulnerable when youve got a unorm on and youre acting in that capacity. Everything happens very quickly.\"So Im very suspicious about bravery. I think we react more instinctively based on our training and our own iniduality. I dont think I could have coped with being an infantryman, for instance. I dont know how those chaps did it, because it must have been hell on earth for them.\"Don can look back on hundreds of hours of operational flying in a distinguished RAF career that included missions for the Special Operations Executive. And yet, despite the passage of years, he has never forgotten the thrill of his first tantalising taste of aviation.\"I fell in love with aeroplanes when I was a kid when Alan Cobhams Flying Circus came to visit our town with an old World War One aeroplane, and it was fascinating,\" Don says. \"He had a couple of old SEs [fighter aircraft] and you could have a flip round the field for  shillings ndash but of course  shillings was half a mans wage, so we just stood there with our mouths open.\"But the smell of hot engine oil, castor oil and fumes and what-not got into you. I was determined to try to get into it in some way, and of course thats what I did.\"He grew up in Kingswinford, Worcestershire, where his father ran a transport yard. Don trained as a motor mechanic after leaving school at the age of  and went on to qualy as a motor vehicle technician in the summer of . He was called up when war broke out in September of that year, having joined the volunteer reserve two years previously.After pilot training he enjoyed rapid promotion in Bomber Command and was an acting squadron leader when, ing from a mission near Hanover in May , his aircraft was attacked from below by an unseen German fighter plane. The bomb aimer, navigator, flight engineer and wireless operator were all killed but Don survived along with his mid-upper and rear gunner. Somehow he managed tohis crippled Stirling to an emergency landing field on the east coast of England despite suffering severe spinal injuries, damage to his left eye, lacerations around his head and a hole in his knee. He still bears the scars.Don spent eight months in hospital and was discharged as medically unfit. However, he refused to accept that his flying career was over and lodged an objection with the air ministry. Eventually his appeal was successful and he was reinstated, being retrained in the new discipline of radio observer.Operations in the aftermath of D-Day included Market Garden in September  ndash \"I went to Arnhem five times during that debacle,\" says Don ndash and he continued in Stirlings until .He and his first we Lillian were married in  and they had three children: daughter Elaine, now living in Ashby-de-la-Zouch, and sons Peter and Robert, who are both ex-Navy. Peter is in Denmark while Robert has a management post at Dounreay.Don ed to the motor trade after the war and became general service manager with a large garage group. He then spent more than  years working in further education, including a spell as head of the engineering department at a college of technology in Salisbury.Lillian died in  after many years of ill-health and in  Don moved to Thurso, coming out of retirement to work for eight years with local firm Ashley Ann. In  he was married for a second time, to Lybster-born Isabel, whose three daughters became part of the family. Isabel died in .Don still keeps in touch with three of his former crew-mates from those D-Day operations: Jim Wayman, the rear gunner, who lives in Dorset Eric Winter, flight engineer, in Coventry and Sid Harrison, the mid-upper gunner, who lives in Crewe. However, there was a particularly close and enduring bond between Don and his pilot, New Zealander Frank Cox.\"Although our families were half a world apart, they sort of grew up together ndash he came over [to this country] and I went to New Zealand,\" says Don. \"In  his daughter rang me from New Zealand and said Frank was dying of bowel cancer ndash he knew he was terminally ill and he hadnt got long to live. They had asked himthere was anything he really wanted, and hed said, Id love to see my old mate again. So I went to New Zealand and I was with him when he died.\"Now you cant explain relationships like that ndash they exist because of the worth of each one of you to the other in action. Its what they call camaraderie. Im still in touch with his family.\"As his thoughtsto the events of  on the Normandy beaches, Don agrees that D-Day was a turning point ndash \"theres no doubt about that\". But he adds: \"I regret to say I dont think weve learned any lessons. I dont think we should be doing what were doing now [in Iraq].\"As I look back I think first of all how lucky I was and I feel very sad about the people who gave their lives in that struggle. Its not really appreciated, the sacrices that were made both on the home front and in action. Its a sad reflection on society, I feel.\"We ought to be very thankful that were free, because thats what it was about. We should remember that this country wouldnt be freeit had been overrun by Nazi Germany.\"It was all for a cause. People may say, Oh, thats patriotic nonsense. But it isnt.\"* This is a slightly edited version of an interview first published in the John OGroat Journal of June , .Sunday  Jan  : AM"},{"url":null,"title":"More festive frustration for Wick Academy as Formartine snatch victory in stoppage time","story":"Wick Academy  Formartine United Formartine United took advantage of a late red card to Danny Mackay to hit an injury-time winner and consign Academy to a second defeat over the festive period.The Scorries struggled to create any clear chances but defended resolutely and the game appeared to be drting towards a goalless draw before Graeme Rodgerrsquos late strike.Manager Tom McKenna made two enforced changes to his side, with Ross Allan and Andrew Hardwick replaced by Gordon MacNab and Craig Gunn. Sixteen-year old Mark Macadie, brother of Richard, made his first appearance on the bench.Academy started positively and Marc Macgregor twice tested Formartine keeper Kevin Main within the opening  minutes ndash first when he scuffed a shot straight at Main after being set up by a driving run down the right from Davie Allan, and then seeing an edge-of-the-box effort comfortably held.With Wick sitting deep in clear defensive blocks of four and five, the visitors took control after that and passed up several decent opportunities to take the lead.Archie Macphee found himself with a clear look at goal a quarter of an hour in but he somehow poked wide of Sean McCarthyrsquos left-hand post, and Rodger followed that moments later by guiding a shot wide of the same spot.After coming through that tough -minute spell, it was Academy who threatened next when, after a great spin in midfield by Grant MacNab, the ball came through for Macgregor whose shot was blocked by Main.The biggest cheer of the half came when Formartine assistant manager Russell Anderson, unhappy with what he felt was a series of unfair decisions against his team, was given a strict talking to by lineswoman Molly Alexander.Academy made a tactical switch with Craig Gunn and Davie Allan swapping wings and Gordon MacNab moving upfield to partner Macgregor up top. The move failed to pay idends as Wick couldnrsquot trouble the away defence throughout the half, Davie Allan coming closest to goal when he skewed his shot wide after a one-two with Macgregor.Formartine similarly struggled to break down a well-drilled home defence, but they smelled blood when Mackay was given a second yellow card in the last minute after a collision with substitute Scott Ferries.It was another Formartine sub who played a key role in the winner when Liam Burnett skipped past Craig Gunn to the by-line and cut back for the unmarked Rodger, who had the simple task of tapping it home.Wick Academy: McCarthy, M Steven, Farquhar, D Mackay, Manson, Henry, Gunn, Macgregor , D Allan, Gordon MacNab , Grant MacNab .

We also have to look at a number of other matters, including disabled facilities and safety issues.\"Mr Duncan thinks it will take between two and three years to get the project at Spittal Hill completed.The complex ndash which would have a standing and covered area for spectators ndash has great potential, according to local businessman and racing enthusiast Colin Calder, who hopes that a round of the British Sprint Championship could be held in the county in the future.At present, Knockhill in Fe is the only Scottish venue on the circuit ndash the others being in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.Mr Calder is fully behind the scheme. \"It would be absolutely fantastic to have something like that in the area,\" he said. \"Caithness and Sutherland has a tremendous pool of talented drivers and this facility would support the up-and-coming ones as well. The track could also accommodate a number of other activities.\"He said the track, which is  metres long and eight metres wide, has been laid out but needs to be tarred.The layout of the track has been paid for by donations as well as money from the Baillie Wind Farm fund. A lot of the stone was donated by farmer and businessman Tom Pottinger.Sunday  Jan  : AM"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118987.jpg","title":"Silence on A9 scheme","story":"A HIGHLANDS and Islands MSP is putting pressure on the Scottish Government to confirm a start date for the pound million Berriedale Braes road scheme.Labours Rhoda Grant says she wants to know when the improvement project will get under way after what she describes as \"years of pushing transport secretaries to get moving\" on it.Mrs Grant has lodged a parliamentary question asking about a starting date and the available funding, claiming there has been a \"deathly silence\" on what has happened to the scheme.She said former transport secretary Derek Mackay had made it plain in a reply in  that the Scottish Government \"must await suitable funding becoming available to progress it further\".In  the then transport secretary, Humza Yousaf, published made orders for the project \"as a clear commitment to deliver the scheme\".

Work is due to start this year, be completed by spring  and create  jobs during the construction phase.Councillor Bremner, who represents Wick and East Caithness on Highland Council, said: \"While Im keen to see an improvement to the north brae, I still believe we cant take our focus off the south brae.

Improvements to the north brae are very welcome and I hope that it is the start of a bigger vision to improve the entire Berriedale Braes.\"We can expect the standard lead-in period of about three months and for discussions to be held with the contractor on how they propose to physically approach the works and discussions with statutory bodies like the Scottish Environment Protection Agency and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds among others.\"He said that archaeological investigatory works have been completed.The award of the contract was also welcomed by Trudy Morris, chief executive of Caithness Chamber of Commerce.She said: \"We are delighted to see that after many years of dedicated campaigning by the chamber, Caithness Transport Forum and other local organisations, this project is finally moving ahead. For too long, the Berriedale Braes has acted as a pinch point for travellers on the A north of Inverness, disrupting business and jeopardising investment in the region.\"It has been good to see other work on A improvements and repairs going to local companies in recent years, and we hope the principal contractor will engage closely with our highly skilled local supply chain as these works progress.\"Ms Morris added: \"Now that the contract has been formally awarded, we hope to see clarication on exact start dates and expectedof works very soon.

Following on from its four other adaptations of children’s classics, as well as pantomimes and avant-garde entries to the SCDA festival, the group has decided to stage a musical version of Arthur Ransome’s well-known book Swallows and Amazons.Developed for the famous Bristol Old Vic theatre, it tells the story of four rather straight-laced children on holiday in the s, given permission, in those pre-risk assessment days, to take a dinghy out onto the lake with their father’s warning not to be “duffers,” in other words, just to be sensible. They soon get their sense of adventure heightened when they meet the fierce Amazon pirates, otherwise the Blackett sisters, Nancy and Peggy. After a brief “battle of the boats” on the lake, they decide to wage another war against the Blacketts’ Uncle Jim, soon to be renamed “Captain Flint,” simply because he has spent the summer writing a boring book and isn’t a fun uncle any more. That, and a mysterious burglary, makes for an exciting, funny and absorbing play, with a surprise at every turn.The story is great fun, all the more so since the production uses a number of clever devices to turn everyday household objects into boats, rocks, weapons and everything  needed to tell the story. The cast, made up of actors ranging in age from  to  plus, have enjoyed creating their characters and learning the very catchy songs with this year#s musical director Glenys Hughes.Soyou want to see how a hall can be turned into a lake without flooding it, Deerness Dram Group encourage you to come along on February ,  or  and join in the fun!

The names of the companies involved have however, not been released.Minister for energy, connectivity and the islands, Paul Wheelhouse, said: “Issuing the Invitation to Tender marks the next stage of the process to award the new contract to operate the Northern Isles Ferry Services.“The contract will run for eight years, allowing us to build a strong working relationship with the successful bidder, and all the routes within the network are being tendered as a single bundle.“The Scottish Government remains fully committed to high quality ferry services to the Northern Isles. A key benefit of this new contract is the in-built flexibility, allowing the ferry services to be amended to reflect future changes in demand across the important sectors of the islands’ economies – tourism, fishing, food and drink, aquaculture and farming. Scottish Ministers will also retain control of all of important issues, such as fares and timetables, through the public service contract.“We are committed to a fair, open and transparent tender which aims to get the best possible deal for the communities that depend on these ferry services.”• Commenting on the issue, Northern Isles MSP’s Liam McArthur and Tavish Scott said: “The Scottish Government have finally issued the tender. The timescale is very tight indeed given the operator needs to be up and running the North Isles leline ferry services in  months’ time. It is essential that companies make constructive bids with improvements to the existing service. It must, in particular, recognise the growing freight volumes that are being exported south to the Scottish mainland.“So the tender bids must be properly assessed to ensure the service moves forward and not backwards.

She agreed to look at ways the Scottish Government may be able to help in identying potential options.Commenting after these exchanges, Mr McArthur said: “It remains a concern that Orkney continues to be without a local abattoir. I am very conscious that the longer this remains the case, the more dficult it will be to find a solution.“I welcome the cabinet secretary’s willingness to re-engage with the Council and other local stakeholders in Orkney in an attempt to make sure that all possible options are fully explored. Mr Ewing acknowledged the importance of the Orkney beef and lamb brands not just to the islands’ but Scotland’s food and drink sector. I hope, even at this late stage, that a solution can be found.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

SSEN say these changes are aimed at improving the security of supply serving one of Orkney#s most remote islands, enhancing network resilience for the local community.The network operator has also installed new automation equipment on the network which allows SSEN’s teams to remotely operate switches, meaning power can be restored much quicker in the event of a power cut by remotely isolating the affected part of the network.Colin Rendall, SSEN’s Orkney Operations Manager, said: “The work on Sanday forms part of an ongoing commitment to target our investment towards improving network reliability in the areas with the greatest potential impact and improvement for our customers. We’re delighted to have completed this project on time and on budget, providing a more resilient, stronger electricity network for our customers on Sanday.“As a responsible network operator, we worked closely with archaeologists and ecologists to ensure all works were completed in a responsible manner, with careful consideration for the local landscape and environment. We’d like to thank the local community for their support and patience during these works.”This work, delivering on one of SSEN’s business commitments, means the main network line serving  properties from Stove to the north end of Sanday has now been upgraded — resulting in a more resilient network for SSEN’s customers living and working on the island.Mobile generation was deployed throughout the duration of the project to minimise disruption to the island community, ensuring schools, shops, hotels and local businesses stayed on supply whilst SSEN’s engineers undertook this essential work.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The programme starting today will culminate with ldquomemory blankets that each participant will design and create.Evanton Wood education co-ordinator Simon Harry said: ldquoThis is a great addition to our summer dementia programme as we have secured funding to continue this programme of activities in the woods throughout the early part of this year.ldquoThe work will be focused at Evanton Community Woods utilising the woodland cabin as a base and using the surrounding forest environment to help bring to le the memories and ideas of the group.ldquoWe will be working closely with local artist Lizzie McDougal who has been a big hit with our group.He added: ldquoLizzie will lead the sessions with input from Evanton Wood staff and volunteers.ldquoThe process will start with two storytelling sessions in which Lizzie will encourage the sharing of memories and stories from each couple within the group. Lizzie and the group will then create sketches from these conversations to use as prompts for the group to aid their design of the memory blanket.The programme is supported by the UK-wide DEEP project , and the blankets will be used at a DEEP gathering to be run at Evanton Woods in the spring. This gathering will be a celebration of all the positive outcomes that those with dementia in the Highlands have achieved.The Evanton Wood programme will run each Friday from .am - pm at the woodland cabin which is a short walk from the top of Chapel Road.Those attending should follow the signs into the wood, and lunch is included.For more information about the activities on offer in Evanton Wood please contact Simon Harry on  or email simon.harry@forest-educationSunday  Jan  : AMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Therersquos no record showing where this bonnet came from other than what is said on the label and all that says is it was found in a bog at Fort Augustus.ldquoMr Harbord thinks it might be the earliest surviving example and that seems perfectly feasible.

He told the Ross-shire Journal: ldquoThis issue has rumbled on for some time and as the public interest shows, needs resolved quickly. I have written to Highland Councilrsquos director of community services, William Gilfillan, to ask that he attends a meeting with myself and other local community representatives.ldquoI am eager to get the community and the council round the table and thrash out the best way forward for Fighting Macrsquos monument. I have also written to the ward manager to request a site visit so I can see for myself the locally disputed health and safety concerns.More than  people have already signed a petition pressing Highland Council to take action. It states: ldquoThe time for excuses has passed, we have been let down far too often by officials.Its instigator, George Murray, who is leading moves for a business improvement district in the town, said he was delighted but not surprised by the public response.He said: ldquoThe council never understood the monument is more than just a local landmark with a nice view ndash in our area the MacDonald monument is a source of pride. The first man to ever make it from private to general in the history of the British army was a local from the Black Isle and people are proud of that history, why wouldnrsquot they be He said: ldquoWhat that shows is just how big the disconnect between the people and the council really is ndash I suspect its own officials are out of touch with the new chief executive, at least she listens.ldquoPeople are saying how they loved going up there as a child and how good it would be for education ndash the closure has really hurt the town.Dingwall Community Council chairman Jack Shepherd said support for the petition was a good indication of the strength of feeling towards getting the monument reopened.One who signed the petition, Iona McAuley,said: ldquoI used to love visiting the monument every Thursday evening with the Dingwall in Bloom group. I often take my children up to sit at the canons and tell them the story behind it. I have promised one day Irsquoll take them inside ndash hopefully in the near future.Another, Ireneusz Grochowski, said: ldquoIt would be great to see Dingwall from the top of the monument. I think it will be an amazing viewpoint for villagers and tourists.A Highland Council spokeswoman said: ldquoThe council has offered a community buyout and are waiting to hearthis is a proposal the group want to progress. We are following the findings of the health and safety report that highlighted a number of issues. Our insurance section has also advised us that the council would be unable to insure the monument for this public kind of use.The petition can be viewed at www.change.org p the-highland-council-open-the-hector-macdonald-monument-to-the-publicWhat do you think  Share your views by emailing newsdesk@spp-groupSunday  Jan  : AMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

This is an issue which needs addressing and one which requires a Strategy, to be put in place.Whilst I like the idea of our local Assembly producing a strategy, it is vital that this statistic is reduced, drastically.”Ian’s we Beverley lost a family member over  years ago, through suicide. Beverley commented: “our family knows only too well the pain and heartache which family and friends endure, following such a tragic loss. For many years, you ask the question why.You also wonder,only they had engaged with someone, and that person had been able to offer some glimmer of hope, which resulted in them not pursuing their course of action. “There have been a number of suicides in our town recently and since the Samaritans are a wonderful organisation, who offer a tremendous telephone helpline service, we thought that it would be worthwhile to try and raise some funds, for this great charity.”The Samaritans’s vision is that fewer people die by suicide. They believe that it is time to look beyond the statistics and into the real lives of these people, so that they and others, can find ways, to reduce any unnecessary deaths. The Samaritans know that when people are in crisis, talking can help that person.Beverley added: “ the money raised at this event, can fund just one phone call to the Samaritans and the Samaritan at the other end of the line is able to provide some hope and results in one person not proceeding with their plan to take their own le,then this event will have been very worthwhile. “I would appeal to anyone who is facing dficulties, no matter what they are, to call the Samaritans on  . The Samaritans volunteers provide a listening ear,  days per year and you can call them any hour of the day, or night,”If you are able to help out in any small way, by baking a few scones tray bakes or by just coming along to have a cuppa and a scone and to give a donation, the organisers will certainly appreciate your kindness.IN PICTURES: Dromore High opens its doors to prospective pupils Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\""},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.3046300.1315907062!/image/1470201368.jpg","title":"college teacher laid to rest","story":"A FORMER teacher at St Patrick#s College was laid to rest at the weekend in one of the largest funerals the area has seen in years.Terry Grantfought an eight-year battle with cancer - one he bore with great courage according to friends and relatives. The father-of-two and husband to Colette was a well-known sportsman in the district, playing gaelic football with Aghaderg, soccer with the Bosco Club, and squash and golf with the Banbridge clubs.Even in the midst of his illness Terry was keen to keep active, taking part in the Past Captains’ nine-hole competition in . Banbridge Golf Club stalwart Tom Fee paid tribute to a dear friend, recalling that occasion five years ago.“Terry had not been well that whole year and he had played no golf at all,” he said. “But he wanted to play in the Past Captains nine holes competition. Along with his good friend, Seamus McGrath, he struggled round the nine holes. Every shot was an act of bravery.At the end Seamus said thatthere had been one hole left to play, Terry could not have managed it. And the amazing thing is, Terry won the Teddy Holton Memorial Salver with the best score of the day. Anyone who witnessed that occasion will never forget it.”The retired technical drawing teacher was regarded as “an inspiration” by former colleagues and past pupils, many of whom turned up to pay their respects and bid farewell to a popular man. Pupils from St Patrick’s College formed a guard of honour for the esteemed former teacher. Parish Priest Fr Frank Kearney told the congregation at St Colman’s Church that it was the largest number of mourners he had seen at a funeral in Annaclone for some time. Fr McAleenan, a past pupil of Terry’s, took time out from a trip home to concelebrate the funeral mass of his former teacher.Tom Fee, who was also a former colleague of Terry’s, said his example, particularly in how he handled his sickness, is one which should be followed.“Terry was an inspiration throughout his teaching career at St. Patrick’s College and to all those he encountered on the sporting scene,” he said. “And, even more so, he was an example to us all in the manner he bore his illness. There were no complaints, no recriminations, just a smile and a positive response. “Terry was a wonderful human being and it was a privilege to be numbered among his friends. Our sympathy goes out to his we Colette, his son Christopher and his daughter Catriona.

When the war was at its height, the factory started making unorms for the soldiers. From her house in Kinallen, she could see the lights of Belfast light up the sky when the German bombers came.“Just after the war, in , Mrs Jess married and went on to have three daughters.

Schoolchildren, cyclists, runners, older people and people with acute medical conditions immediately spring to mind, but in fact I think everyone should carry an ICE Card. People don’t think twice about wearing a seatbelt or cycling helmet, butyou had a serious accident you’d like your next of kin to know as soon as possible and you’d want the best care possible in a medical emergency. Almost everyone carries a wallet or purse with them so this is the ideal place to keep an ICE Card”.Chief Inspector Barney O’Connor commented: “PSNI is fully supportive of this initiative which is straightforward, practical and user-friendly and provides families reassurance that a loved one has personal information accessible in all emergency situations. Ideal for use whether you are a student studying away from home, an older person or someone with a medical condition.”The ICE Card ensures all the essential information is accessible in one place meaning it could help save lives, provide the best help and care, as well as make sure your next of kin can be contacted promptly.Information about medications and allergies helps ambulance personnel make better decisions about treatments they can give you and crucially in the case of heavy blood loss, it is important for emergency staff to know your blood type. In the case of people with conditions such asAlzheimer’s it can help a person who may be confused contact their family and avoid any unnecessary distress.The cards are initially being rolled out at PCSP and PSNI engagement events and through groups.

In Belfast we have load of Victoria places. A hospital, a shopping mall, a university. We also have a bridge named after Queen Elizabeth. Of course those named venues are not really about the women they are named after. We all know it is about their position, the reign of empire and monarchy.The only other place named after a woman that I am aware of is the Mary Peters’ Track. Unlike the aforementioned, it is hard to view that negatively. Mary earned it the hard way.There are also very, very, few places named after working class heroes. As we walk our streets in West Belfast we walk on the roads named after imperial battles or, less insultingly, places like Donegal. The exception is the Michael Ferguson Roundabout named after the beloved councillor who died too young but had dedicated his short le to the people of Colin.In the s, when standing in the Bolshoi Ballet in Moscow, being hosted by Mikail Gorbachev, Mrs Emma Groves was handed a blini with caviar. She turned to the only other woman in attendance from West Belfast, Clara Reilly, and said, “I think I’d prefer a fish supper.” That night at the performance, Clara sat beside her friend Emma, who had no sight but could hear the glorious music, and she described to Emma the intricate costumes and the air-like dancing.Emma Groves and Clara Reilly were not there on a jolly. They were not invited as political favour. They had travelled to Moscow at the height of the Cold War to ask for help for the most forgotten and dismissed of victims of our conflict. They lobbied for Soviet support to end the use of plastic and rubber bullets. In the same breath we can mention a similar visit by these two women to Washington to lobby the other side of Cold War incredibly impressive human rights advocacy that would be recognised more universally had they not been Irish women from West Belfast highlighting British state abuses. Mrs Clara Reilly embodies the spirit of freedom. A spine of steel and a heart of gold. Her story is yet to be written. But she has some of that story still to write.When Emma Groves passed away, she was carried by those who loved her, including Clara, in a willow basket. She epitomised humility. It was no surprise that her final wishes were to contribute to the earth. She gave example to us all.Both women shone a light of humanity in the darkest of days. Despite horric violations of injury and bereavement visited upon them both, they could only think of others who they used their hearts and strength to support and advocate on behalf of. While other human rights advocates on this island looked to South Africa or Nicaragua in safety, these women stood in their own streets and insisted on human rights beginning at home.This weekend Belfast will have a new nameplate. This time for two working class women who would not be silenced or intimidated. Who refused to allow a line of expedient amnesia to be drawn during our peace process. Our streets become richer with their names. The history of human rights in Ireland will now speak of Emma and Clara. Our friends.

I worked there for a further two years under the stewardship of Jim Deery, who I owe a lot to. Jim really gave me a foot up when I needed it. I cut my teeth in the back streets of the New Lodge learning about social justice, community development and participative democracy.“I always knew I wanted to work with young people – it’s my passion. In St Malachy’s I spent as many free periods as I could get playing football as opposed to studying – I wanted to do teaching at that time, but I wasn’t really interested in the A-Levels I was doing.“There was always that draw to work with people, young people in particular. My mummy was always heavily involved in the community and volunteering, so I also have that family background.”After six years at the Star, Chris went on to become a Senior Development Officer at the Bytes Project before taking up a post as the Children and Young People’s Coordinator with Belfast City Council, where he helped set up a city youth forum and Belfast’s first skate park.Remarkably, he took up the Director’s role at NIYF just a few years later when he was just  years old. It presented a massive new challenge, which Chris insists he was well prepared to meet, despite his young age.“It was definitely in my DNA,” he said.“It’s about building the capacity of young people to affect positive change.“We always talk about young people being part of the solution as opposed to being the problem, and again I have to pay credit to Jim Deery, he was the one who schooled me in that chain of thought.“All of those people in the Star really heavily influenced my thinking. All of my jobs since leaving school, whether it was in voluntary or paid capacity, had that underbelly. It’s about people making positive change for themselves.“When the job in the Youth Forum came up it was like a dream job, it was allowing me to do something that I had been practising for years, but only on a regional basis.“The role here is very strategic. You’re linked into government, you’re linked into the EU, we’re presenting to the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child, so we’re doing all of this amazing work internationally as well as locally.“We are working with young people who are on the margins, such as homeless young people, and seeing those young people building their own capacity to affect change in their own lives and communities is amazing.”He continued: “Some days I feel like I should come in with a firefighter’s hat, because you spend an awful lot of time fighting fires and managing mini crises.“A big part of the job is strategising, lobbying and campaigning. I often talk about speaking truth to power, so it’s about bringing the voice of young people to those in a position of power. Sometimes that’s uncomfortable for those in positions of power, because you’re banging down doors to try to affect change for the marginalised people in society. Every day is a battle. You’re fighting a fight for people who are getting the rough end of the stick.”In an ever-changing world, the problems faced by young people have become increasingly complex, and Chris says that many of them are challenges faced by young people the world over. However, he believes that legacy of our recent conflict makes many of our own young people’s challenges unique.“Whether you’re in Belfast, Paris or Sydney, there are massive problems around mental health, drugs, poverty, exclusion and all of these things you can apply to any area,” he said.“The big thing here is the legacy of the past – it’s the lens that magnies all of these problems. I would relate a lot of the reasons our high suicide rates and mental ill-health to the conflict and the legacy of the past. There is a lot we still don’t know we talk about transgenerational trauma. You just need to look out the window and you can see people living with these issues and a lot of it is linked to the conflict. If we don’t deal with legacy and we don’t deal with the conflict then that’s not going to go away.”Despite the magnitude of the task ahead, Chris and the NIYF are relentless in their pursuit of a better society. After serving that eye-opening apprenticeship he now heads one of the largest providers of non-formal education in the country. There is undoubtedly a lesson to be learned from his experience.“I know it’s a cliché, but what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger,” he said.“Every time you are faced with a challenge it can be a valuable lesson. Again, another cliché, sometimes you learn more in failure than in success. I’m a great believer in ‘Mól an óige agus tiocfaidh sí – praise the youth and they shall prosper’.“In my work le and in my voluntary work teaching kids in sport I try to teach them about work ethic. I try to teach them that hard work beats talent and that talent doesn’t work hard.“The education system as it is set up is designed for maybe  per cent of high achievers, so in my opinion it is failing so many young people. Non-formal education, for us, is about finding that passion. For us it’s about encouraging young people to find the thing that lights the fire in their belly.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"poignant site set to be named after clara and emma","story":"LORD Mayor Deirdre Hargey, along with community leaders, are to attend the unveiling of ‘Groves Reilly Corner’ at the former Andersonstown barracks site in tribute to the late Emma Groves and fellow human rights campaigner Clara Reilly. The renaming of the site, taking place on Saturday, is especially poignant as it is where Emma and Clara stood for decades in protest at human rights abuses and in memory of those fatally injured and killed by plastic bullets. Speaking ahead of the unveiling Relatives For JusticeDirector Mark Thompson said: “What these two women have given our community and achieved is remarkable and as a community, a society, a country, we have been privileged and blessed to have had them there for us all.”Mark added: “And it is this very combination of their work, humanity and humility, which they bring to that very vocation of standing up for rights when and where required that makes them stand out even though they’d be the first to shy away from such public accolades. “Emma Groves and Clara Reilly were also instrumental in establishing Relatives for Justice , our NGO, in April , ensuring that a holistic support and care package, from professional therapeutic counselling support for trauma survivors partnering a rights based advocacy casework approach for addressing human rights violations, framed our work. We stand on the shoulders of giants in the sense that ordinary people both made extraordinary sacrices and did extraordinary work at great personal risk in extraordinary times. “Their motto was simple, in that they paraphrased Edmund Burke, in saying ‘That evil can only flourish when good people remain silent.’ They refused to stay silent,” he said. Paul O’Connor from the Pat Finucane Centre described Emma Groves and Clara Reilly as “two lives of resistance”.“Two women who were leaders in their community –and Clara still is,” said Paul. “Many communities would be lucky to have had one of these indomitable fighters. Belfast and beyond had two but for the saddest of reasons. We say that Emma was ‘blinded by a rubber bullet’ in November  but she was actually blinded by a British soldier, a Para, who deliberately fired a rubber bullet at her face. “There wasn’t even an allegation that she was a phantom gunwoman or nail bomber. She simply refused to turn off the rebel songs she was playing in her own home. At some level the British Government must have regretted that day because Emma Groves went on to campaign, highlight, expose, denounce and bear witness to the dangers posed by rubber and plastic bullets in the following decades.“It is totally appropriate that the site of the former Andersonstown RUC barracks, scene of so many pickets with Emma and Clara, should now be renamed to honour these two strong working class women who did so much for others. “The chattering classes can keep their MBEs and CBEs. Clara and Emma are and were real heroes. And Relatives for Justice is a fitting tribute to all those years of dedication and struggle.”NI Amnesty Programme Director Patrick Corrigan recalled first meeting Emma Groves and Clara in the early s when “in Emma’s living room in Andersonstown, over a cup of tea, she told her harrowing story”.“Wearing her trademark dark glasses, she recounted the day in  when she lost the sight of both eyes after being shot in the face at point-blank range with a rubber bullet. Like so many stories from our recent conflict, Emma Groves’ inidual experience was of one of unwarranted violence and unnecessary pain.Clara Reilly and Emma Groves founded the United Campaign Against Plastic Bullets to bring together families bereaved or injured by rubber and plastic bullets and to end their use here and everywhere.“Campaigning by Emma Groves and Clara Reilly shone a light on the human rights abuses and suffering inflicted through use of the weapons, and inspired many to stand with them. They would later help found Relatives for Justiceand inspire its model of mutual support and advocacy.”Ancient Order of Hibernians’ Sean Pender added: “We are proud to add our voice to recognise Clara Reilly and Emma Groves as the community that they worked so hard and long for dedicates the junction of Falls, Glen and Andersonstown Road in their honour.“These two remarkable women stood strong and never wavered in their quest for justice and peace. The AOH was proud to have honoured Clara with its highest award, the Seán McBride humanitarian award, several years ago in recognition of her long history of civil and human rights work.“It is entirely appropriate that there will be an area that will forever recognise the work of these two great women.”The Groves, Reilly and Livingstone families are lelong friends and played prominent roles in the campaign to ban plastic bullets. Belfast Media Group editor Robin Livingstone said: “It was a pleasure and a privilege to have known Emma and to know Clara. The line of placards on the road beside the barracks was and is a familiar August sight and my family can think of no better place and no better way to celebrate the inspirational lives of two amazing women.” The unveiling of Groves Reilly Corner will take place on Saturday January  at pm."},{"url":null,"title":"lifestyle changes necessary to tackle climate change says minister","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

-year-old passed a police eyesight test on Saturday morning as the investigation into Thursday’s crash continues, with police saying “any appropriate action” will be takennecessary.Meanwhile the passenger in the Kia car involved has been named by the Sundayas Emma Fairweather, , who broke her wrist, and it said her friend suffered cuts to the knee in the crash.The newspaper reports Ms Fairweather, a mother-of-two, has told family and friends she is unhappy with how the incident has been dealt with by police and Buckingham Palace.The nine-month-old baby boy was unharmed, police said.A Norfolk Constabulary spokeswoman said the force was aware of the photographs taken on Saturday and that “suitable words of advice have been given to the driver”.She said: “This is in line with our standard response when being made aware of such images showing this type of offence.”Buckingham Palace did not comment on the images.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  A nine-month-old baby was

Sandringham.The Queen’s transport manager Alex Garty was seen at Sandringham as a replacement Freelander was delivered to the royal residence on Friday.Philip exchanged “well-wishes” with the injured women and appeared to have no lasting problems following the collision on the busy A-road, a palace spokeswoman said on Friday.A source said on the same day: “The duke’s routine in the coming days will continue as normal.”He was examined at hospital on doctor’s advice, but a check-up found no injuries of concern.Norfolk Police said the women in the Kia were treated at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in King’s Lynn following the crash and later discharged.In a statement on Friday, the force said: “As is standard procedure with injury collisions, the incident will be investigated and any appropriate action taken.“We are aware of the public interest in this case, however, as with any other investigation it would be inappropriate to speculate on the causes of the collision until an investigation is carried out.”\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Broken glass and car parts on the side of the A near to the Sandringham Estate Retired NHS worker Victoria Warne told The Sun she spoke to the duke at the scene of the crash as she looked after the injured occupants of the Kia.The -year-old, from Norfolk, said: “The passenger from the other car told me, ‘I always wanted to meet a royal – but not this way’.She said the duke asked after the welfare of the Kia occupants, adding: “He looked so worried and told me, ‘I’m such a fool’.”Her -year-old husband Roy helped the stricken duke out of his car, and he told The Sun Philip was overheard telling police he had been “dazzled by the sun”.Nick Freeman, the lawyer dubbed Mr Loophole, said the duke could be prosecuted for driving without due care and attentionhe was deemed to have made a mistake.But he added: “If the sun was so low and right in your eyes, sometimes it’s impossible to see, and that may well have been the case, and that would afford him a defence.”The duke, who retired from public duties in  but remains active, could also avoid prosecution by surrendering his licence, according to the lawyer known for representing celebrity clients like David Beckham.The crash happened as Philip’s Freelander pulled out of a side road on to a stretch of the A which was earmarked by the local authority for possible safety measures.The duke appeared to be travelling without a police protection officer, iniduals who guard all senior members of the Royal Family when at public and private events.At a meeting,

The students’ display of blatant hate, disrespect, and intolerance is a signal of how common decency has decayed under this administration. Heartbreaking. https:t.co NuPnYuFP— Congresswoman Deb HaalandJanuary , In a joint statement, the Roman Catholic Diocese of Covington and Covington Catholic High School apologised to Mr Phillips.Officials said they are investigating and will take “appropriate action, up to and including expulsion”.The statement said: “We extend our deepest apologies to Mr Phillips.“This behaviour is opposed to the church’s teachings on the dignity and respect of the human person.”This is indigenous lands. Were not supposed to have walls here. We never did.Nathan PhillipsFacebookTwitterAccording to the Indian Country Today website, Mr Phillips is an Omaha elder and Vietnam veteran who holds an annual ceremony honouring Native American veterans at Arlington National Cemetery.In a video posted online, he wiped away tears as he said of the incident: “When I was there singing, I heard them saying ‘Build that wall, build that wall’.“This is indigenous lands. We’re not supposed to have walls here. We never did.”He said he wished the group of youngsters would instead put their energy into “making this country really great”.State politician Ruth Buffalo, a member of the Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara Nation, said she was saddened to see students showing disrespect to an elder who is also a US military veteran at what was supposed to be a celebration of all cultures.“The behaviour shown in that video is just a snapshot of what indigenous people have faced and are continuing to face,” she said.She added that she hopes it will lead to some kind of meeting with the students to provide education on issues facing Native Americans.Congresswoman Deb Haaland, who had been at the rally earlier in the day, sharply criticised what she called a display of “blatant hate, disrespect, and intolerance”.She tweeted: “This Veteran put his le on the line for our country. Heartbreaking.”"},{"url":null,"title":"four vehicle accident closes main derry buncrana road","story":"A number of people are understood to have been taken to hospital following a four-vehicle collision on the main Derry to Buncrana road.The accident, described by the PSNI as \"serious,\" occurred close to Coshquin.The road is currently closed.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshMotorists travelling from the city are being erted at the Whitehouse roundabout while traffic coming in the opposite direction are being erted through Benview housing estate.Police are advising motorists to seek alternative routes."},{"url":null,"title":"foyle mp meets mccallion meets dept infrastructure key strategic projects north west","story":"Sinn Féin MP for Foyle, Elisha McCallion, has met with officials from the Department for Infrastructure and the civil service to discuss the progress in key strategic projects for the north west.Speaking after the meeting, she said:“I met with the permanent secretary of the Department for Infrastructure and the civil service officials dealing with city deals to discuss a range of key strategic projects in the North West.“Among the issues we discussed was the progress made for securing a city deal for the North West as part of the wider strategic growth plan, as well as key infrastructural projects such as the A and A upgrades.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“We also discussed the expansion of Magee and the need for the British and Irish government to work in collaboration to deliver all of these projects.\"She concluded: “These are key strategic projects which will completely transform economic opportunities in the North West and I am committed to working with all stakeholders to ensure they are delivered for the benefit of everyone.”Photo shows Ms McCallion following the meeting."},{"url":null,"title":"hughs house provides derry parents sick children","story":"A fundraiser will take place in the Creggan area of Derry today in aid of a charity which supports parents with sick children.Hugh’s House in Dublin provides free accommodation for parents of children who are being treated in hospital and have nowhere  to stay.It has emerged that several local families have been assisted by the charity since it opened a number of years ago.A volunteer from the charity said that ‘plenty of lovely families’ from Derry have stayed at Hugh’s House.“Three Derry families had been staying with us for the last - weeks and two children have just transferred back to Derry hospital last Friday,” she explained. One of those families was Rachael Mooney and Kevin Lynch, whose baby, Hope Isabella, who was born at  weeks weighing  grams - she had stopped growing at  weeks.They had picked the name Isabella but when she was born their families said \"we will just have to live in hope and keep up the hope for everyday she is living so Kevin looked at her and said, we are calling her Hope.\"Baby Hope is said to be \"doing well’\" and has just been transferred back to Altnagelvin Hospital. The Dublin-based charity offering a haven for families of sick children was founded by Ade Stack after she lost her son, Hugh. Sadly, Hugh lived for just eight months and for the majority of that time he was cared for in hospital. Through her own experience she noticed families sleeping in waiting rooms, cars or having to travel long distances every day.Ms Stack took it upon herself to establish Hugh’s House so that parents in the same situation would have a place for respite which also allows them to remain close to their child in its time of greatest need.Parents are allowed to stay at Hugh’s House free of charge, it is situated at Belvedere Pl, Mountjoy, in Dublin which is a short five-minute walk to Temple Street Children’s University Hospital.Whilst there, parents are also able to share their own experiences which helps build an important support network at what it a very distressing time.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“It’s a place where you’re loved, where you’re cared about, showing that the wider community does care that you’re going through this hard time,” Ms Stack explained.“We depend on the generosity of the people of Ireland, those who say, thank God I will never need that house. Hugh passed away in the August, we never got a cent off the HSE, but we knew the need was there so we actually opened the Spring after he died. The first Mother’s Day after Hugh died was spent hoovering the stairs.“We all expect to lose people in our lives but when you lose a child it’s really hard because it feels unnatural. But this feels really natural, it feels like we just made a little herd and the love of all the people who helped us in the house, all of the rooms have been adopted by families who lost a child, and I hope all of that love is present in the house, and people feel loved and cared for and wanted.”At the house volunteers cook meals for families and there is a play area for young children who may be visiting their sick siblings.Local Independent Councillor, Gary Donnelly, became aware of the charity recently in his role as a community representative. He has now encouraged the public to register to take part and support fundraising efforts tomorrow. “I became aware of Hugh’s House recently when I was looking for help for a local family and I am aware that a number of families from Derry have recently availed of the service. “Creggan Community Collective will be holding a fundraiser on behalf of Hugh’s House Dublin. We will be doing a sponsored Spin Cycle beginning at am on Friday th January. The cycle will cover the distance of  miles the distance from Derry to Dublin.

We could all learn so much from him.Cllr Walker said he hoped those who targeted Ryanrsquos cookie box would realise the error of their ways and stop again outside the young manrsquos home to pay for the food they took.ldquoWhat happened in the dead of night outside Ryanrsquos home is a sad reflection on those responsible. If they do not pay for the goods.

As a result, Castle Park will have provision for a number of motorhomes which are welcome to park up overnight and enjoy what Newcastle has to offer.Cllr Devlin said the provision of the new spaces at both parks will be completed in advance of the new barriers being erected to ensure that there is no gap in provision.She thanked council officials involved in addressing the motorhome issue and is pleased local authority officials plan to speak with representatives from the motorhome community to see what more can be done for them.Cllr Devlin added: ldquoThere is an acceptance that motorhomes contribute to the local economy and that needs to be encouraged and supported where possible..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Young Down side lift McGirk Cup  ","story":"DOWNrsquoS hurlers lted the McGurk Cup at The Dub in Belfast on Saturday night after an entertaining and close showdown that went to the wire.The university lads looked well beaten at one stage, but Simon Dohertyrsquos charges hit back from being - to - down, minutes into the second half to hit back and draw level at - to - as the game entered the final stages.However, it was Ronan Sheehanrsquos Down side who held their nerve and late, unanswered points from Paul Sheehan , PJ Davidson and Conor OrsquoPrey were enough to quell the studentsrsquo gallant challenge.Shea Shannon opened the scoring for the students with a point from play in the fth minute, but a sensational goal from way out on the right hand sideline from Cormac Coulter and a point from Tom Murray had Down - to - to the good.However, UU responded with three points of their own from Oisin McManus and James OrsquoConnellto draw level by the th minute.The sides then exchanged points before scores from Coulter and two Sheehan frees handed Down a - to - lead after  minutes.

By  Northern Ireland had become constitutionally stable, with record support for the Union. Since the vote to leave, the shock of the decision itself and the shambolically destabilising nature of the Brexit negotiations which then unfolded have eroded that support.Some nationalists believe that hardline DUP figures had a calculated strategy to leave the EU in order to see a hard border and thus dferentiate Northern Ireland from the rest of the island. In truth that is unlikely to have featured much in their thinking – and almost certainly not in the thinking of the leadership.From its formation in , the DUP preached hard line Euroscepticism. Founder Ian Paisley’s fusion of fundamentalist Protestantism with politics led to him presenting the EU as a “satanic” force. As late as , he was describing the EU as “a beast ridden by the harlot Catholic church, conspiring to create a Europe controlled by the Vatican”.While many DUP members would give little credence to that proposition, they were instinctively anti-EU for more prosaic reasons, including the EU’s curtailment of British sovereignty. Over time, the DUP came to pragmatically recognise that there were benefits to the EU. But even as the party modernised and expanded, it remained Eurosceptic.Therefore, when it became clear that a referendum on EU membership was to be called, backing a remain vote was always impossible.And yet, for some reason, the party preicated. Whereas for months Sinn Féin and the SDLP were stating that they would campaign to remain, the DUP waited to see what would become of David Cameron’s attempts to renegotiate the terms of EU membership.But in that vacuum, senior MP Sammy Wilson began moves which made clear that regardless of what the party decided, he would be campaigning to leave. In November , the former Stormont Finance Minister joined Ukip leader Nigel Farage at a Leave.EU event. When Ukip challenged the DUP to “come off the fence”, the party denied that Mr Wilson was out of step with its policy. But it was clear that he was advocating a policy which the party said had not yet been decided.In January , Arlene Foster took over as DUP leader. When I asked her about the continued uncertainty over the party’s stance, she responded that the DUP would “definitely” back one side but would “wait and see” what the PM could negotiate before picking a side.Man killed and woman critical in Warrenpoint shooting‘We saw horrors of Nazi Blitz with our own eyes – politics had nothing to do with it’ Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Later that month Mr Wilson emphasised that he would not be waiting. He attended a cross-party Grassroots Out meeting where he signed ‘The Kettering Declaration’, pledging to work to leave the EU.Days later, the confusion led toDUP MEP Diane Dodds mocking Mr Cameron’s renegotiation, saying that he wasn’t asking for enough from the EU – but then refusing to say that the DUP would definitely campaign to leave.In early February, Mr Wilson’s friend and fellow ardent Eurosceptic Ian Paisley Jr went on the Nolan Show and, when asked about the DUP’s EU referendum stance, he said confidently that within “hours... definitive positions will emerge”. That did not happen.But the following day, Mr Wilson told the Commons that the EU reforms on offer amounted to a “dodgy deal which even Del Boy would be embarrassed to be associated with”.Yet still the DUP would not say which way it would go. It would take another  days for the DUP to do so and it only did that at the last possible moment, on the day that the vote was called and in doing so the party said that the decision was taken “on balance”, with an implicit nod to the fact that not everyone would agree. While the best that the DUP’s small but senior band of pro-EU members could have hoped for was that the party would stay neutral, Mr Wilson’s actions preempted that decision and put pressure on Mrs Foster.Recent academic research by Mary C Murphy and Jonathan Evershed of University College Cork sheds further light on what went on around that period. The report, part of a collaborative three-year ESRC project ‘Between Two Unions: The Constitutional Future of the Islands after Brexit’ involving UK and Irish academics, included private interviews with multiple DUP figures.One DUP MLA told them: “I was at the policy-making conference that we had – I say conference, it was a meeting upstairs – where they said, ‘right gentlemen, we need to agree our policy on Brexit’ – this was before the referendum. And  minutes later we had agreed our policy. We just went round the room and it was, ‘Burn it! Shoot it! Strangle it!’”The academics believe that “the DUP’s coming out for leave was as much a matter of party management and political expediency as of ideological principle” and that an unprepared leadership never expected to win. They quote a DUP MLA saying that they were “gobsmacked” when they won and that “obviously, we hadn’t developed policy on the basis of Brexit [but] now we’ve had plenty of time to develop policy. And that policy is out on the strongest possible terms!”There are obvious dferences between then and now. Unlike , the DUP now understands the signicance of this decision. Mrs Foster is also now much weaker than she was then,yet the DUP has the power to topple the government.But there are unmistakable similarities. Just as it preicated then over its decision, now it is delaying stating what precisely it wants. Its “one red line” of no Irish Sea border leaves everything , including the customs union and single market, beingnegotiable. The logic of that one red line is that the party could support either the softest of Brexits or the hardest of Brexits – no deal – because either keeps the UK intact.Mr Wilson is again at the vanguard of the intra-DUP debate and appears to be discreetly pushing no dealthe backstop remains, writing in the News Letter this week that the UK can leave with no deal.But this time he is not the only voice. Others are alive to the strategic importance of this move. Interviewed by Mark Carruthers on The View on Thursday night, DUP MP Gavin Robinson was asked whether the DUP could support a very soft Brexit. In response, he gave a “qualied yes”, saying that there would be “earnest engagement” on such a proposalit protected the Union.If the DUP backs a Brexit in name only, it is vulnerable to internal rows and to rivals asking why it argued for the nation to go through such vast upheaval for such a small change which will rule out many of the potential benefits of leaving the EU.But no deal carries the risk that the cultural nationalists and growing non-tribal group of voters who will be critical to the Union’s survival could reassess their constitutional preference. Evensome of the claims about no deal are hyperbolic nonsense and even in a best case scenario where there are no signicant economic or social disruptions, there is still a risk for unionism.For both sides, Brexit has always been as much about emotion as about facts. If people feel that a disastrous decision has been taken, it could be very dficult to persuade them otherwise – and the DUP is supremely unsuited to persuading non-unionist voters of anything.The academics conclude that “no party has been more impacted by Brexit than the DUP” with the issue fuelling its mistrust of nationalism, Dublin and Brussels while also having “reinforced suspicions about the extent to which the British government is a reliable guarantor of unionist interests”.Publicly, the DUP will almost certainly continue to sound bullish. But privately, senior figures know that they are involved in momentous and uncertain decisions of historic signicance.l Ben Lowry, page JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Disclaimer  Privacy policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_auto,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.newsletter.co.uk/webimage/1.8776465.1547926243!/image/image.jpg","title":"transport","story":".... , , , , Would you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Newsletters\"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia Ltd , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"By clicking on register, you will be creating an account with Belfast Newsletter and agreeing to JPIMedia Ltd#s Standard Terms and ConditionsWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia Ltd , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \" addCustomTextToCreateAccountTemplateNewslettersWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia Ltd , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"  \". s .  \". s  \". s  \".after+text+ .+text+ .before+text+ .after+text+  Transport   Jobs Cars Homes  Directory  Announcements  Advertise My Business NewsletterRegisterLoginEdit Account\"Sign Out\" --\"    --       News Transport Politics Crime Farming Education Business Environment Health Your Say Opinion Offbeat News Politics Crime Farming Education Business Environment Health Your Say Opinion Offbeat Sport Football Rugby Union Cricket Golf Motorcycling Boxing More Sport Whats On Music Theatre  Comedy Arts TV  Film Eating Out Lestyle Nostalgia People Family Gadgets  Tech Outdoors Travel Cars Read This           Transport      Emergency services praised after light aircraft crashes on runwayThe emergency services have been praised for their swt response after a light aircraft crashed on a runway at Causeway Airfield south of Coleraine this afternoon.

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We can now offer our customers a streamlined product supply chain package by integrating their co-packing requirements with the grouprsquos warehouse and transport subsidiary companies.ldquoLogistically, this works out to be more cost effective overall, but also lowers the carbon footprint on the transportation of food products, which is something we are passionate about.Wild Water Group has a current annual turnover of poundm and Mr Rattenbury believes the company can increase that figure by a further poundm within  months and then reach poundm within two to three years.The project is backed by a pound. million investment from Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking and the Development Bank of Wales and has secured Welsh Government funding under the new economic contract.Using a similar business model to the grouprsquos other three sites in Merthyr Tydfil, Llanishen and Cardf Bay, the first phase of development will be the conversion of available space into a large ambient open plan co-packing facility, which will be operational early November  to meet festive season demand.During the first quarter of , Wild Water Group will move the entire Cardf Bay co-packing facility to Aberbargoed, once freezer facilities, production lines and machinery are in place.The company will then continue services such as frozen to frozen storage, bagging, over wrapping, sleeving and tray sealing, as well as the full spectrum of print labelling applications required under the Food Safety Technicalspecications.Economy Secretary Ken Skates said: ldquoThis project will not only see a successful, growing Welsh business create an additional  jobs, it will also create a new strategic hub and facility for both large and small food and drink businesses across the region to pack or store products themselves. This could, in turn, open up new markets for those businesses ndash so Irsquom excited about what this means not only for Wild Water Group and Aberbargoed, but for the region more widely.ldquoIt shows that both our Economic and Food and Drink Action plans are delivering what we had hoped ndash jobs, prosperity and sustainable growth. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Under the terms of an amendment tabled by Dominic Grieve and controversially passed by MPs, she has until Monday to present a new plan to the Commons.While the details of this Plan B are not clear, the chairman of the Eurosceptic European Research Group, Jacob Rees-Mogg, wrote in the Mail on Sunday that it was possible for Mrs May to get a deal through the Commonsshe persuaded the EU to show flexibility on the backstop and pound billion orce bill.ldquoIf I had to choose between no deal and Mrs Mayrsquos original accord, I would have no hesitation of opting for no-deal Brexit but even Mrs Mayrsquos deal would be better than not leaving at all, he wrote.ndash Itrsquos good to talk: Mrs May has offered to talk to opposition parties and groups with dferent desires and views to find consensus in Parliament. But her refusal to abandon no-deal Brexit and other leadersrsquo refusal to speak properly until she does suggests one party will need to cede some ground.Also writing in the Mail on Sunday, the chief Brexit representative for the European Parliament, Guy Verhofstadt, said: ldquoIf necessary, this document could still be enhanced in the next coming weeks.ldquoBritish politicians will always find an open door to do that, but they must act soon.ldquoThis will only happenpolitical parties in the UK start to work together.ldquoSuch a cross-party approach is not natural to the adversarial UK political system, but itrsquos time to change course and to put the national interest ahead of narrow party political interests.ndash Confidence vote .: The opposition can in theory call as many of these votes as they like, although the Lib Dems have said they will not support another as they believe it is a waste of time. Such a vote could trigger a general election but this is very much the nuclear option for Tory rebels and the DUP have already said they will not vote with Labour, so it appears to be a forlorn hope.Theresa May and EU President Jean-Claude Juncker ndash Back to Brussels for more talks: The EU has said repeatedly that it will not reopen negotiations on the Withdrawal Agreement, and ldquoassurances on the Irish border backstop were dismissed by Brexiteers earlier this week. There is little time and no clear indication what more the EU can or wants to offer. France has stepped up its no-deal preparations.ndash Asking for an extension of Article : Mrs May has previously insisted almost to the point of foot-stamping that Britain will leave the EU on March , and a U-turn here would enrage already puce Brexiteers.But writing in the Observer, Unison general secretary Dave Prentis said: ldquoThe PM has pushed us dangerously close to the exit door with perilously little left on the clock.ldquoSo itrsquos vital that immediate steps be taken to extend article .ldquoNot to stop Brexit, but to ensure that therersquos time to force a change of government, or find a solution parliament can back.ndash Halting Article : A court case last year ruled that, while all  other EU states have to agree to extend the Article  process of leaving, the UK can unilaterally reverse it. Neither the Tories nor Labour support a halt but Philip Hammond reportedly told business leaders in a conference call on Wednesday that a bill being rustled up by backbenchers would have this as its aim.The Peoplersquos Vote campaign calls for a second referendum ndash A second referendum: Labour members at conference left the door open to supporting a new vote on leavingthe party could not trigger a general election. Mr Corbyn was applauded by Labour activists when he pointed this out in a speech on Thursday. But he also indicated he would rather leave with a Labour-flavoured Withdrawal Agreement.Former attorney general Dominic Grieve wrote in the Sunday Times: ldquoI have made no secret of my support for the Peoplersquos Vote campaign but it is important to recognise that this idea may well gain support only at the end of a process when every possible Brexit option has been explored.ldquoI do not doubt that legislating for a new referendum is a dficult decision and the last resort for many MPs.ldquoWe must, however, pursue this debate with courtesy, listening to those of other views and finding areas of common interest, but keeping our own preference in mind. I am convinced on grounds both of common sense and the national interest that a new public vote will be helpful to resolving this crisis.ndash No-deal Brexit: If Theresa May loses and Parliament cannot come together behind an alternative, the UK will leave the European Union on March  without a deal.

Osborne King’s Richard McCaig said: “We are delighted to welcome Firemelon and CYTI as our first office tenants in the building so soon after our launch. “The quality of the scheme is exceptionally high and given its central location we have received a number of enquiries from other tenants.”David Corney told Ulster Business: “We are extremely excited to be moving our two businesses into this prestigious development in such a fantastic city centre location“It further extends our already decade long commitment to Belfast as our software development hub and will help us retain our highly skilled workforce as well as attract the best talent the city has to offer to work on our products.”There are now three floors remaining within the building, covering around , sq ft, with a show floor available for viewings.Elsewhere in the city, one of Belfast’s most prominent office blocks has gone on the market for £m.

Ulster Business takes a further look A few years back, the options were fairly limited for NI firms when it came to venture capital funding.Now, between private funds, investors and those backed by Invest NI, the options have widened signicantly for companies – especially those which are high-growth – to seek a cash injection, and get to the next level.Jayne Brady is partner at the Bank of Ireland Kernel Capital Growth Fund NI.“We have been operating in Northern Ireland for five years, and in that period we have seen a growing momentum in the Northern Ireland ecosystem,” she told Ulster Business.“We have  companies in our portfolio, and have invested in eight companies in Northern Ireland as part of that.”And a lot has changed in the last few years, particularly with the sheer number of avenues in which businesses can find access to funding.“There wasn’t an availability of local funds, and it was dficult to get that level from GB, because you needed to reach a certain level.”And where is the investment now going in Northern Ireland  “It’s very strong sectors of expertise, and there is a big FDI element – medical technology, cyber-security. It’s not created in isolation, andan availability of skills.”“More recently, there has been more external investors. We would co-invest, and there is a level of investment from outside players – there are good opportunities.”Jayne says that Kernel Capital tracks investments, and the level and size of deals here has grown. A lot of that has been down to the growth of the Knowledge Economy – which has expanded seven or eight-fold in the last few years.For businesses looking towards funds like Kernel, a typical deal size is from around £m up to £m.One of the largest investments was secured by B-Secur, which has created a biometric technology which uses the human heartbeat to unlock everything from finance and healthcare through to cars and buildings.The company, based at Catalyst Inc, secured £.m from investors including Kernel Capital and ADV.For Jayne, Kernel is looking at companies with turnover of more than £m, which have the ability and scope to be scaled.“We see investment where there is a scaling potential. We look at companies where we are generating £m plus –– which you can scale rapidly, or those with a deep IPfocus. Some companies in services won’t have that level of scale.”Then, there’s the Growth Finance Fund, and Growth Loan Fund II, which provide a total of £m of funding for Northern Ireland’s SMEs.The two new funds are being managed by WhiteRock Capital Partners, a homegrown fund manager set up in  to manage the first Growth Loan Fund, which has committed £m of loans to more than  businesses over the last six years.There’s also the Growth Finance Fund. That will see loans from £, up to £m going to growing businesses. It’s also the first time the British Business Bank has invested in a fund aimed solely at supporting Northern Ireland businesses. The latest figures from the Irish Venture Capital Association, which covers businesses across the island, show venture capital funding has slumped, with a fall-off in major deals and seed funding.Investment was down by almost a third to €min the first nine months of the , confirming a signicant slowdown on .The drop-off in cash accelerated during the year, with the amount raised by tech firms and startups in the last three months just half what it was a year earlier.The figures suggested that the largest segment of funding to see a decline is in deals was above €m .But a Northern Ireland report by Catalyst Inc, published last year, showed companies raised over £m in equity capital in .Elsewhere, flying the flag for venture capital in Northern Ireland for more than  years is Crescent Capital.Run by Colin Walsh, former CBI chairman in Northern Ireland, it’s invested in a raft of the most successful and leading companies here.That includes Andor Technology and Belfast-based biotech firm Fusion Antibodies, which is based at Springbank Industrial Estate in the west of the city.According to Jayne, it’s not just about backing Belfast firms, or FDIs setting up shop in the heart of the city.“We look towards the strong sectoral focuses, and outside Belfast as well. We are very conscious to go to our customers.” That includes holding regular open events across areas such as Newry, Co Tyrone and Londonderry. “We are very open to meeting any companies, and our door is open,” she says.But will Brexit play a part in the future of venture capital funding in Northern Ireland  “We need to be cognisant of any particular indication of any change in regulation,” Jayne says.“From our perspective, because we invest in deep tech, they are somewhat removed from that direct impact.” Elsewhere, there are other revenue streams which firms can look towards, especially when it comes to working capital.That includes Upstream – an alternative finance company run by Judith Totten, which specialises in funding for SMEs.“As Northern Ireland’s largest independently owned and managed provider of working capital, Upstream works collaboratively with organisations’ existing lenders to provide additional capital in a more flexible way to help businesses thrive,” sales director Alan Wardlow says.“Businesses come to us for our responsiveness – our formal credit approvals are achieved in days rather than weeks or months. Upstream has long standing relationships with many local venture capitaland private equity providers as well as the ious Invest NI-backed loan funds and we work closely together to provide solutions for business owners across Northern Ireland“We recently incorporated a trade finance solution into our product range to bridge the gap for organisations who require additional growth funding, quickly, to deliver orders beyond their current capability. This funding is proving incredibly popular alongside our long-standing invoice finance option which gives organisations the ability to release funds against their debtor book thereby freeing up cash flow for businesses to seize growth opportunities as they become available.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/steve_web.jpg","title":"the catalyst to putting northern ireland on the global map","story":"Posted on Wednesday  January  by Ulster Business Ulster Business speaks to Catalyst Inc chief executive Steve Orr about his hugely ambitious plans for growth, expansion and moulding NI into a world-leader in tech ‘We aren’t going to follow anyone , and we need toto becoming leaders in the world.’It’s immediately clear that Steve Orr has big ambitions for Catalyst Inc. He’s just taken over at the helm of the internationally renowned next generation science park which is home to  innovative knowledge based companies, who are employing more than , engineers, researchers, entrepreneurs and executives, across four locations – and has his sights firmly set on making Northern Ireland a leader in two key innovative areas of tech business.Taking on the role as chief executive of Catalyst from stalwart Professor Norman Apsley OBE, just two months ago, plans are under way to build on the foundations of an organisation which has an estate of , sq ft of agile workspace filled with innovative companies. Catalyst leads the way in innovation and entrepreneurship by supporting the creation and growth of innovation companies in Northern Ireland.“We have a rightful place in leading the world. We aren’t going to follow anybody. Let’s get back to leading the world,” Steve tells Ulster Business.“I am going to take the foundation that Norman left and look at how we leverage that by a signicant factor – in terms of economic activity and dynamism for Northern Ireland.“We need deeper, more strategic partnerships with key institutions. It is through collaboration we can do something to scale and put Northern Ireland on a world map.”Catalyst is the thriving, beating heart of Northern Ireland’s booming technology sector and leading the way in educating and preparing companies and young people for the changing world of work through the impact of the ‘Fourth Industrial Revolution, which is seeing the impact of new technologies impacting on le, work and society.Formerly known as the Northern Ireland Science Park, Catalyst is an independent not-for-profit organisation operating across the region. It provides agile workspace across four locations – the main site in Belfast’s Titanic Quarter, the Innovation centres in Londonderry, and Ballymena and most recently opened Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub, a co-working space dedicated to the fintech sector in Belfast city centre, which is a partnership with Danske Bank.“The business model we have had for the first  years was the perfect model for that period. We need a new model for the next. We are identying a simple, but ambitious strategy – building on the existing foundation.”Part of the strength of Catalyst is in attracting big international firms, such as Citi, in close proximity to businesses at the very birth of existence. Steve says as a result, “accidental encounters” lead to relationships and outcomes which otherwise, would not have happened.It also plays host to Queen’s University’s leading research body, ECITwhich itself is home to CSIT .Some of the leading thinkers based at the site include ECIT’s Professor Maire O’Neill – one of the youngest ever engineering professors at Queen’s, one-time UK Female Inventor of the Year and a leading researcher. “You have US companies looking at why would they want to move to Northern Ireland – they want to meet Professor O’Neill. She’s amazing,” Steve says.“Then there are cyber companies, like B-Secur. The firm specialises in technology which can read your ECG heartbeat as a unique biometric identy verication.“There are other indigenous companies, like Titan IC in cyber-security, Displaynote and ProAxsis. We have great companies that are now making a dent in the world.”And pushing forward with what his predecessor Norman Apsley built, plans are under way to expand and redevelop Catalyst further still.That includes another new building, Pierpont  – which will provide another , sq ft of space – and a revamp and refurbishment of Catalyst’s Innovation Centre, as part of an addition £m investment.“We want to make this the best place to work – improving the environment, the flow around the campus, the accessibility, and the experience, so that you love being here.“We want to refresh some of the buildings on the site. The Innovation Centre will be modernised by March and we will freshen-up our identity.”His big goal is to lead the way in two areas of technology and business at Catalyst – putting Northern Ireland front and centre.“We want to help to incubate two clusters where Northern Ireland leads the world.“How do we build on what ECIT is doing  We take the start-up capability, and ecosystem we have in Northern Ireland and leverage that further.“We want to make it easier for corporations to set up in Belfast and Northern Ireland in order to access amazing research talent. They want to define what the next big breakthrough is.“We can develop something for global companies that they can’t find where in the world. We want to create clusters, that will act as a magnet to attract hundreds of companies.”One of the unique elements of Catalyst is Connect – a network of experienced entrepreneurs, business professionals, top research talent and potential investors who provide their time and experience pro bono to help foster and develop the next generation of entrepreneurs.“It’s helping entrepreneurs to figure out how to build a company around their product idea and providing the support to validate and access the marketplace, capital, investment and or talent,” Steve says.“With the Connect network, we had  early stage companies or entrepreneurs engaged in our programmes last year. There is a lot of exciting and vibrant activity going on at the moment.”And it was Connect, which Steve founded and developed at Catalyst, which first drew him back home to his native Northern Ireland, following years of running and founding tech firms in the West Coast of the US.“I was an entrepreneur in Calornia for a number of years, in San Francisco and San Diego. I was there for the peak of the dot coms,” he said.That included his own start-up business, Kineticom, as well as other tech companies. It was his time in San Diego which resonated strongly with Steve.“Personally, I became obsessed with the San Diego story and the parallels to Northern Ireland. When they started on their journey in , San Diego had a population of . million people, % of their economy was dependent on the public sector. They have an ocean to one side, a mountain range around them and another country to the bottom of them.”San Diego went from the bottom of every league table to the top – with the collaboration of top universities, research and development and entrepreneurship, building the city into the tech stalwart it is now.The Connect  emanated from San Diego – a concept which help shaped the programme in Northern Ireland.“Meeting Norman Apsley at the Science Park was just the most beautul thing ever,” Steve says.The financial and economic impact and contribution that Catalyst has is hard to ignore. It’s estimated the businesses which operate there contribute around £m in GVA each year.“Everything we do is based on the simple belief that innovation has the power to transform our economy. People around the world are all innovating quickly, adapting new technologies, articial intelligence, for example. In Northern Ireland,people are producing goods and services, but are behind in adopting those new technologies, our economy is going to be in trouble as we will not be competitive.“The question is, how does innovation become the foundation on which everything is based ”And as a result of Catalyst’s research into the NI Knowledge Economy, an annual report published later this month, which acknowledges the huge changes to the workplace in the coming year, Catalyst is hosting their second Future of Work summit in May  – aimed at demystying how roles and traditional jobs are changing, right across the Knowledge Economy sectors.Of course, Brexit is still on the horizon. For Steve, the main concern is around the availability of talent. “The tech sector is hungry for talent, but with the uncertainty in the last couple of years, fewer people have been willing to consider moving to Northern Ireland. That places a lot of pressure on the existing employees in the sector.”“Long-term, we have to be optimistic and look at the opportunities which can come out of Brexit. The businesses within the Knowledge Economy are export driven, representing over % of all NI exports. With % of these exports outside the EU, the Knowledge Economy is the sector least dependent on Europe and should be the key for driving growth at this time of uncertainty.”So, for Steve, his level of optimism and dynamism is clear in his new role, one which he says he is “very fortunate” to have.“It’s a position which comes around so rarely, and whoever gets the opportunity is so blessed and fortunate to have the opportunity to lead. We have a talented team of people who are all passionate about what is possible. It’s so exciting. The opportunities and possibilities are endless.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/323433.jpg","title":"theresa mays brexit deal voted down business reaction","story":"Posted on Wednesday  January  by John Mulgrew Business groups have overwhelmingly raised concerns over crashing out of the EU without a deal after Prime Minister Theresa May’s withdrawal plan with Brussels was overwhelmingly rejected by MPs. Ann McGregor, chief executive of Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry “The business communities that we represent have always had a erse range of views on what form the UK’s future relationship with the EU should take, however they do agree on the need to avoid a messy and disorderly Brexit. “To achieve this we therefore need an agreement that will secure the transition period and protect jobs. As businesses wait to see what happens next in Parliament, it is crucial that those at Westminster move beyond tactical manoeuvring and look at all the options in order to avoid a ‘no deal’s scenario. “Firms are in the dark on too many aspects of le after March . This has already led to many businesses taking action – pausing on recruitment and investment, stockpiling goods, and relocating factories in other parts of the EU. In fact, a third of NI Chamber members are currently putting growth and investment plans on hold in the absence of clarity from Westminster. There is however nothing to stop government acting decisively on areas within their control, such as migration and customs procedures.”  Aodhan Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium “The result this evening will be a cause for concern across the Northern Ireland business community. Northern Ireland businesses desperately need certainty about the UK’s future trading relationship with the EU and will be severely disadvantaged by a no deal. A no deal Brexit means that Northern Ireland households will face higher prices and less choice on the shelves something they can ill afford. “Se need politicians  to coalesce around a workable solution that protects consumers from the costs and disruptions due to the loss of tarf-free and frictionless trade we currently enjoy with partners in the EU. We are now closer than ever to the possibility of a no-deal that will be a disaster for Northern Ireland.” “  Angela McGowan, CBI Northern Ireland director “Every business will feel no deal is hurtling closer. A new plan is needed immediately. This is now a time for our politicians to make history as leaders. All MPs need to reflect on the need for compromise and to act at speed to protect the UKs economy. “No deal would immediately put Northern Irish jobs and businesses at risk and jeopardise years of positive economic development and integration across the island.  It must be avoided to protect our all-island economy.”  Glyn Roberts, Retail NI chief executive “This is a disappointing but not unexpected result. While the Prime Minister’s draft Withdrawal Bill was in no way perfect, it was definitely preferable to crashing out of the EU with no deal. “The Government now needs to work on a cross-party basis with Labour and other opposition parties to reach a broader agreement for a withdrawal deal and secure the transition period, protect jobs and a positive future relationship with the EU  Colin Neill, chief executive, Hospitality Ulster “Leaving the EU without a deal would damage the sustainability of the Hospitality industry and impact on the potential growth of Tourism in Northern Ireland. We appeal to our elected representatives to work together in a spirit of consensus government to ensure that a no deal scenario does not happen.”  Tina McKenzie, FSB NI policy chair “With the clock ticking down to Brexit Day in just  weeks, we are running out of time to avoid a clf-edge, no-deal outcome. “A disorderly exit from the EU would be deeply damaging for small businesses, causing disruption to supply chains, increasing costs and stling investment. “A no-deal is something which we simply cannot countenance, so it is imperative that political leaders sharpen their focus and do all they can to reach agreement in the short time available.”  View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
