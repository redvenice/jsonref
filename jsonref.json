A total of 2,000 artists will be given a basic income of €325 per week, under plans approved by the Government on Tuesday. The Basic Income for Arts Pilot Scheme was launched following cabinet on Tuesday. The artists will be chosen at random and receive the stipend over a three year period.Speaking at the launch of the initiative, the Taoiseach said the very notion of Irishness was inextricable from artistic traditions of storytelling, expression through music and other forms. He said the scheme had the potential to be as significant an intervention as other steps take to support creative communitie thourgh the history of the state, dsuch as the creation of the arts council in the 1950s. He said the overarching aim of the scheme was to address the “earnings instability” and also to inform future policies in the area. “This pilot scheme has the potential to change tha landscape of the arts in Ireland and how we fund it,” he said.Smoking banTánaiste Leo Varadkar said the scheme would rank alongside the smoking ban and the plastic bag levy in that it would be recognized overseas as an Irish policy intervention that would have wider applications in other jurisdictions. He said the Pandemic Unemployment Payment was a “lifeline” to the arts “but I know that isn’t what you wanted,” he said, and that artists would prefer to be working and earning rather than relying on the State. The basic income was the main recommendation arising rom the report of the Arts and Culture Recovery Taskforce - live worth living - which was launched by Minister for the Arts Catherine Martin in 2020. Ms Martin said the measure is a research project and builds on recent efforts to highlight the need to support incomes in the arts. She said the scheme delivered on the recommendations of the recovery taskforce, and she said it was a “once in a generation, transformationoal” measure for the arts. She said it reflected the value of the arts for their intrinsic value and how they impacted personal and collective wellbeing in the State. “For generations, Irish artists have inspired people all over the world,” she said, adding that the scheme would be a “watershed” moment for the arts. The payment was not a social welfare support but a payment in recognition of the value of creative and artistic work, saying how people “leaned into the work of artisits during times of need”, especially during the Covid-19 pandemic. “It is the arts that will help us make sense of what happened and help us shape the future,” she said, adding that she is determined the pandemic does not do permanent damage to the arts sector.Claire Duignan, who chaired the taskforce on recovery in the arts, told the launnch that the central recommendation of a basic income scheme was identified “from the very start” of its work, to address the risk they identified of people drifting away from the arts during the pandemic due to income insecurity. “It’s hugely satisfying to be here today for the launch of this scheme,” she said. She said the arts were pillars of the creative, cultural, tourism and other sectors. “Protecting, supporting, nurturing and valuing the artist” was the most important thing a country could do to support the arts, she said. She said there should not be an annual debate over how much to allocate to the scheme. The scheme will be “non-competitive”, the Department of Arts said in a statement, and that once someone satisfies the eligibility criteria, they will be be able to enter into the randomized selection process. The payment will be taxable, but the amount of tax paid will depend on inidual levels of income. Eligibility is to be determined by the deficiotn of the arts contained in the Arts Act 2003, meaning expression in a variety of forms including theatre, literature, music, dance and others. Guidelines for the scheme will be available on the Department’s website on Tuesday.

Photograph: EPAAndy RainA British government minister has accepted that “further dialogue” is required with the Irish government over a controversial US-style visa waiver for non-Irish EU citizens crossing the Border as part of proposed changes to immigration laws.During a debate in the House of Lords on Monday prior to a vote, the planned pre-travel clearance checks for those entering Northern Ireland were branded “unworkable”, with members urging the UK Lords Minister, Susan Williams (Baroness Williams of Trafford) to “make concessions”. Responding to criticism about lack of communication with the Irish Government and tourist chiefs, she said: “We do accept the need for further dialogue with interlocuters including the Irish government, Tourism Ireland and Tourism Northern Ireland. I totally accept that point.” Last Tuesday, Westminster MPs voted to reinstate the proposal for an electronic waiver following an amendment by the House of Lords to exempt Northern Ireland from the new legislation. The day after the Commons challenge, the Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney said as far as he was concerned, it had not been finalised. He described the decision as “regrettable”.Coming under the British government’s Nationalities and Borders Bill, the proposal will require EU citizens who are not Irish will to apply online for pre-travel clearance -known as Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA) - before entering the UK, including when crossing the Border into the North.Addressing the Lords on Monday after submitting an amendment, Paul Murphy (Baron Murphy of Torfaen) said he was “hopeful the Minister would have spoken to her colleagues in the Northern Ireland Office and would have made some concessions on this”. “But the dead hand of the Home Office is there again,” he added. The former Northern Ireland Secretary of State said he was “troubled” by the introduction of an ETA, at a cost of €14, saying it would severely impact on tourism, cross-border health services and the “spirit of the Good Friday Agreement” . “Is it really worth jeopardising our (BritishIrish) relationship which is bad enough as it is over the last number of years by this petty and silly proposal by the government...I hope the government will change its mind but I’m not hopeful.”The planned change to the law will also apply to citizens of the European Economic Area (EEA) living in the State, which includes people from Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland.Non-British or non-Irish citizens from other countries, outside the EUEEA, which previously did not require a visa to enter the UK, will now need an ETA.Former SDLP leader Margaret Richie also expressed her opposition, saying the ETA scheme was “unworkable”.“It is unenforceable and would violate the very premise of reconciliation in terms of the Good Friday Agreement,” she told the Lords. She asked the UK minister to “consider the geography” of Border towns and villages, saying: “I believe the Home Office hasn’t fully considered that.” “There’s one village that straddles both Donegal and Fermanagh, that is the small village of Pettigo where that Border goes straight down the middle. “Within one minute you could be in the Republic of Ireland and the next minute, you could be in Northern Ireland.” She queried what discussions had taken with the Irish Government as well tourism organisations.The human rights NGO, the Committee on the Administration of Justice (CAJ), has also condemned the move, which it said was “unworkable and risks a hard border for many non-British and non-Irish citizens in Border communities who have been able to freely cross the Border to date”.Baroness Williams — who described herself as “an Irish woman with a father from Northern Ireland” — indicated however that the ETA plan was likely to be passed. “Once the EU’s come into force next year, Ireland will stand out as one of the few countries in Europe without an ETA style pass,” she said. Referring to tourism, she said that “once granted, an ETA will be valid for multiple trips to the UK”, and that the cost is “likely to be small and unlikely to be a deterrent for visitors”. “Moreover, many of the UK’s international partners have taken a similar approach to border security...It is a very familiar concept for travellers,” she added."},{"url":null,"title":"public sector pay deal talks set for later in month","story":"Minister for Public Expenditure Michael McGrath: Each additional 1 per cent on the public pay bill costs about €250 million in a full year.

However, in the light of surging inflation, the unions have triggered a clause in the deal that allows for a review if circumstances change substantially.The unions triggered the clause two weeks ago, and Government sources said that officials from the Department of Public Expenditure would meet Irish Congress of Trade Unions officials before the end of April.Unions are under pressure from the activists on rising costs, and that pressure is expected to grow as they enter conference season for the trade unions. “This is the only thing being discussed at branch agms and so on,” said one senior union source.Negotiations timetableA Government source said officials would meet with the unions before the end of this month to “sound each other out”, with a view towards entering negotiations before the summer. If a deal was agreed, it could be ratified by the unions over the summer and take effect in the autumn, effectively superceding the existing agreement, with bigger pay increases for public servants than the scheduled 1 per cent later in the year.“If that’s the timetable they’re thinking of,” said one trade unions source, “we’d need to get started.”Minister for Public Expenditure Michael McGrath suggested an extension to the current deal at the weekend, but unions will seek further pay increases this year, whether there is an extension or a new agreement.Unrealistic demandsSome Government sources favour a new agreement of short duration, perhaps for one year, which would allow the two sides to return next year when the political and economic environment may be more stable.Government officials have warned, however, that demands from some union figures for pay rises to match the rate of inflation were unrealistic, and would not be agreed by any government. “There’s no way were going to 6 or 7 per cent, that’s not going to happen,” said one senior source.The Department of Public Expenditure says that each additional 1 per cent on the public pay bill costs about €250 million in a full year.It is also understood that the Government is likely to hold out the possibility of tax reductions of some form in the budget later this year as part any offer to the

appointed a woman as Deputy Chief of the General Staff for the first time.The appointment of Major General Sharon Nesmith has been approved by the Queen. She will begin her new role in August, upon promotion to lieutenant general.Maj Gen Nesmith is already the most senior woman in the Army and has previously spoken of how she was told she would have to resign if she wanted to have a family when she signed up in 1991.Her appointment means that the Army and the Royal Air Force will have women serving at three-star rank, the second-highest level in the Armed Forces. Rear Admiral Jude Terry, the Royal Navy’s most senior woman, holds two-star rank.Maj Gen Nesmith said: “I feel deeply honoured to be appointed as the Deputy Chief of the General Staff at such a pivotal time for the British Army. I look forward to playing my part in leading our Future Soldier transformation to become a more lethal, agile, digitised and expeditionary force.”The Deputy Chief of the General Staff is mainly responsible for managing the Army’s budget and setting the policy for recruitment and career management.Maj Gen Nesmith currently runs the Army Recruiting and Initial Training Command, where she is responsible for the recruitment and training of more than 35,000 Regular and Reserve officers and soldiers across 280 Army courses each year.Although young enough to be eligible for promotion to the highest level in the Army, Maj Gen Nesmith is unlikely to be in the running for Chief of the General Staff in due course as her service has not majored on the “fighting” career path of the infantry and armoured units.She was commissioned into the Royal Corps of Signals in 1992 and spent much of her formative career in Germany. She completed three tours in the Balkans and served in Iraq.Women have been unable to serve in the so-called “teeth arms” of the Army until recently. Following the disbandment of the Women’s Royal Armoured Corps in 1992 – a largely administrative unit – women were absorbed into the rest of the Army. However, they were still largely restricted to support and medical positions.A Ministry of Defence study in 2002 concluded that women in ground combat roles could adversely affect “unit cohesion”.It was not until Dec 2014 and the publication of the Women in Close Combat review that a recommendation was made to end the ban on women in front-line infantry and armoured corps roles.A year later, David Cameron, the prime minister at the time, announced that all Armed Forces roles would be open to women.However, only after Gavin Williamson said in 2018 that women could apply for all combat roles, including Special Forces units, could women serve with parity alongside male colleagues.General Sir Mark Carleton-Smith, the Chief of the General Staff, said: “I am delighted that Sharon Nesmith will be the next Deputy Chief of the General Staff on promotion to Lieutenant General this summer. She is the right person at the right time to drive the Army’s transformation and she brings a wealth of experience, energy and fresh ideas.”More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Every Russian will learn the truth about Bucha, Volodymyr Zelensky vows London local elections 2022: When are they, why is this year significant and how to vote?Local Elections 2022: What is up for election, where, and how to voteCody Ackland pleads guilty to murdering Plymouth teenager Bobbi-Anne McCleodPolitics latest news: Senior Tory MP suggests Boris Johnson privatising Channel 4 out of \u0026#39revenge\u0026#39Pink Moon 2022: when it peaks in the UK and other full moon datesMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"dan walker leaves bbc channel 5 talent exodus continues","story":"Dan Walker will leave the BBC for Channel 5, becoming the latest high-profile figure to join an exodus of talent from the corporation.  The BBC Breakfast presenter has announced that he is leaving his £295,000-a-year role to become lead anchor on 5 News, with his exit following those of Andrew Marr, Jon Sopel and Emily Maitlis.The exodus comes amid shrinking wages at the BBC, insiders said, as well as efforts to clamp down on moonlighting by requiring stars declare earnings from paid work outside the broadcaster.It has been suggested big-name talents facing salary reductions of up to 10 per cent may be frustrated at having to disclose how they bolster their incomes outside the BBC. Mr Walker, a former Football Focus presenter, was last year included on the first register of staff earnings from outside engagements, alongside Mr Marr and Ms Maitlis.It is understood he will have a more bespoke role at Channel 5 and encouraged to help pitch and create new programmes.

The transfer was put on hold due to Covid - but the Mirror understands ministers plan to restart it this Spring. The Department for Work and Pensionswill start with a small number of Tax Credit claimants, up to a cap of , households. They then plan to remove the cap and move onto disability and other benefit claimants, to have everyone on the new six-in-one benefit by the end of . But the Social Security Advisory Committeewarned the change “creates a signicant risk” for benefit claimants, many of whom have “complex lives”.  It also creates risks for the DWP in delivering its plan, the committee warned. Chair Dr Stephen Brien warned there must be “independent oversight and scrutiny”. He announced he would be seeking further advice from experts over plans to lt the ,-household cap. Ministers insist Universal Credit is often more generous than old-style benefits, after they were repeatedly forced to reform it amid public anger and poor Brits turning to food banks. The six-week wait was cut to five, allowances for people in work were raised, and the amount given to debt repayments was cut. But campaigners point out some people could still be worse off. Anela Anwar, chief executive of anti-poverty charity ZK, said lting the , cap must get fresh approval in Parliament. She added: “It ensures DWP avoids a repeat of the shambolic early stages of Universal Credit, when many people were left without anything to live on for weeks or sometimes even months on end. “That resulted in MPs getting hundreds of complaints from desperate and angry constituents.”  Dr Brien was one of the original brains behind Universal Credit, and faced questions over his impartiality in  when he became SSAC chairman. He hit back at this at the time, insisting his work would be “evidence-based”. He told ministers on the latest change: “I can provide assurance that we do not wish to unduly delay the process. “We will not be undertaking a large-scale public consultation on this occasion but intend to seek the advice of a small number of experts, including those with signicant experience or expertise of agile processes and their governance.” But he added: “For the public to have confidence in this process and to minimise risk further consideration needs to be given to establishing appropriate independent oversight and scrutiny of the programme as it moves forward.” DWP Permanent Secretary Peter Schofield said in November that he was “determined” to see Universal Credit fully rolled out by December . He told MPs: “We got the funding in the spending review to finish this on time.” The benefit’s director general Neil Couling suggested the transfer would be a “slow, slow, slow experience”, adding: “You need to develop your processes and do that with small volumes.” A DWP spokesperson said: “Universal Credit is a modern dynamic benefit which supports people in and out of work. We have always been clear about our ambition to move people over from the legacy systems, which are complex, inefficient and based on aging, inflexible IT. “The Department will continue its regular engagement with the committee and our ambition remains to see the rollout of Universal Credit delivered safely and on time by .” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Department for Work and PensionsPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

On Thursday all of us spent the day desperately reading gas and electric meters, photographing them from seven angles and spent two hours trying to send the numbers to a crashed website, while we screamed and family members muttered “take six deep breaths and try again” because the next day the price was going up by two million per cent. Thanks to this sense of fun from companies such as EDF and E.On, from now on we can play this jolly game every year. It can become like searching for Easter eggs, and we’ll all laugh about the time Grandma didn’t quite get her reading in on time, bless her, so she spent the next month living in the sideboard clutching guinea pigs inside her nightie to keep warm.  In a few years, it will be a festival, like Halloween. Each March  one person will dress up as the EDF man and ­children will scream “aaaaagh don’t take our heating away”. People will run from house to house looking into cupboards with a torch, then we’ll all eat raw pizzas that we cannot afford to cook to celebrate ­Meter-reading Day. This has happened becausewe don’t have an exact reading from the moment the price goes up, the energy companies can charge us for everything at a higher rate. They’ve been given a licence to do whatever they fancy. Next week it will be announced: “Due to rocketing fuel prices, energy companies can marry one person from every household” and it will be considered a great honour to hand your sister over to Scottish Power.  The Government gives advice on how to “shop around” for cheaper tarfs, as it’s our responsibility to see which of the big six suppliers are slightly less impossibly expensive than the others. It’s like the police saying: “There have been a lot of robberies in this area lately, so we’ve decided to crack down. We’ve set up an app, so you can contact all the muggers in the area and arrange which one you would like to hold you at knepoint and run off with your bank card.” Because it’s all down to you. This is why you’ll find Government websites that give advice such as: “Save money on boiling water by filling a pan, and taking it to your local crematorium to pop it on the furnace during a funeral, so you enjoy a well-earned brew.”  The only people who aren’t told by the Government how to reduce energy costs are the energy companies who set the costs. I suppose there’s no point in ordering them about as they’re completely helpless. Since  they’ve paid £billion to their shareholders, but there’s nothing they can do to stop that. Their prices and profits just keep shooting up until eventually they’ll own the universe, and creatures from other galaxies will wonder why they have a bill for £ from British Gas. So all we can do is huddle around a candle with a raw fish finger to celebrate.

The official said: “Russia is redeploying elements of the forces that are in Georgia to reinforce the invasion of Ukraine. “We don’t think that this was planned, it’s a very odd thing for the Russian military to do. So we suspect it’s indicative of the problems they are having in Ukraine.” The order came five weeks into Russiaaposs invasion, which has run into fierce Ukrainian resistance. The issue of conscriptsapos involvement in the war is highly sensitive. On March , the defence ministry acknowledged that some had been sent to Ukraine after Putin had denied this on ious occasions, saying only professional soldiers and officers had been sent in, Reuters reported. Putinaposs spokesman said at the time that the president had ordered military prosecutors to investigate and punish the officials responsible for disobeying his instructions to exclude conscripts.  The annual spring military draft, which runs from April  to July , will affect Russian men between the ages of  and , Putinaposs decree said. Shoigu said on Tuesday that those called up would begin to be dispatched to their assigned bases in late May. Most military personnel will undergo professional training in training centres for three to five months. Let me emphasize that recruits will not be sent to any hot spots, he said in remarks published on his ministryaposs website. However, Mikhail Benyash, a lawyer representing several members of Russiaaposs National Guard who refused an order to go to Ukraine, said that under Russian law conscripts could be sent to fight after several months of training.US President Joe Biden today called for a war crimes trial against Putin, and said he was seeking more sanctions after the reported atrocities in Ukraine.Biden told reporters earlier today: “He is a war criminal.  “This guy is brutal, and what’s happening in Bucha is outrageous and everyone’s seen it. “I think it is a war crime ... He should be held accountable.” At the press conference, Biden added that he plans to hit Moscow with additional sanctions for its conduct throughout the war - which began with Putin sending troops over the border into Ukraine on February . The president said, Iaposll let you know, when asked about the nature of those sanctions. Shocking footage emerging from journalists in Ukraine showed charred bodies on a highway near Kyiv. Ukraine said  of some  bodies found in Bucha northwest of Kyiv were victims of extra-judicial killings by Russian troops. Satellite images showed a -foot-long trench dug into the grounds of a church where a mass grave was found. Ukraine called for an International Criminal Court investigation that France and Britain said they would support, and rights group Human Rights Watch said it had documented apparent war crimes. Russia said alleged crimes by its troops in Bucha were a provocation and no resident suffered. The UK has said Russia appears to be committing war crimes but has stopped short of describing the action as genocide, as it is called in Ukraine. That is because the UK sees genocide as something defined by a court of law. A Western official said the UK is “quite legally purist” about the situation. Western officials hope the International Criminal Court will be able to play the role of prosecuting war crimes in Ukraine. Officials are doubtful about the possibility of setting up a separate Nuremberg-style war crimes tribunal, called for by Gordon Brown. An official said that would require a UN Security Council resolution - which couldn’t get through because Russia has a veto.

Saffia Pawlett, , from Middlesbrough, said she was speechless when she saw Denley had dropped two tubs - emulsion and gloss paint - on her kitchen floor.After spending two hours cleaning her kitchen, she posted a photo of the mess on Facebook and asked for help on how to get the mixture out of the cheeky totaposs clothes.She wrote: “So this happened...

It’s emulsion and gloss.” For more of the news you care about straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here While some people tried to offer Saffia a bit of comfort and some advice, many people pointed out she probably wouldnapost be able to save the clothes. One person said: “I wouldaposve just shut the door on it and gone to the pub!” Saffia, who works as a care navigator in a GP surgery, explained that she sometimes looks after “threenager” Denley at the weekend to give her mum a break. She said: I was sitting in our front room with Denley on FaceTime to my mum as he was telling her about the owls we had seen that day and he askedhe could have an ice cream. He’s very independent and likes to get things himself so we’ve been focusing on teaching him to ask first rather than just getting.  I said he was more than welcome to get one and they were in the bottom drawer of the freezer. However, Saffia had forgotten about the tubs of emulsion and gloss sitting in a box on top of the freezer. Denley accidentally knocked the box over, which in turn spilled their contents everywhere, but despite the destruction Saffia didnapost hear a sound. She added: I thought it was odd he hadn’t ed asking me to open [the ice cream]. I jokingly said to my Mum ‘He’s quiet - that’s never a good sign’. “But never in a million years did I expect that. When I first saw it I was stunned to silence, I truly had no words. I watched him for what felt like an hour . I think I was frozen in shock!

However, describing her nephew as an absolute sweetheart she added he was keen to help her clean up after making so much mess. Saffia said: “There was so much paint it was like he was recreating Bambi on ice. “I rang my husband and told him he needed to come home, I didn’t have the words to explain what had happened, just that he needed to come home as soon as possible. “That’s where the picture came from. He ran all the way home. Ryan took charge of cleaning Denley but needed to get him upstairs to the bathroom - we had just gotten new settees the weekend before so taking him through the front room was a big no! “Poor Ryan had to strip down to his boxers and carry him out the back door, round the house through the front door. “Ryan mentioned later that night he was very thankful I found the situation funny as he would’ve struggled to find the funny side!” Although no one on Facebook was able to give Saffia a miracle solution for getting Denleyaposs clothes clean, she enjoyed the funny comments she received. She added she had to send her in-laws to the shops to replenish her cleaning supplies when she tackled the kitchen. Saffia said: I was so fortunate that so many comments were filled with similar stories and that a lot of people found so much enjoyment in the photo. !I didn’t see any negative comments on the photo and I’m pretty sure I’ve got the admins of the group to thank for that!

Haleigh Walsh, , from Tipperary in Ireland, has struggled with her weight all her le - needing a custom gown made for her when she had her communion aged seven. As she got older, Haleighaposs weight crept up and at her heaviest, she topped the scales at st lbs and was wearing size  clothes. Haleigh said: I ate big portions and am shocked now looking back at just how much I could get through. I’d starve all day then have takeaways, share bags of crisps, chocolates, anything I wanted. For more of the news you care about straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here She added she refused to exercise and found herself in pain just from walking. People would tell me I had a beautul face. But I knew my weight was a problem, she said. After planning a holiday in Portugal with her friends, Haleigh says a friend told her something that made her think twice. She said: An old friend told me a horror story of a man who’d been so big he was marched out of his seat to the back of the plane. I was so terried of that happening to me that I bought a second seat, so I wouldn’t be impacting anyone. I remember sitting there on the plane and thinking, aposI am never doing this againapos. Knowing she had to do something about her frame, Haleigh spoke to a relative who had had successful weight loss surgery - and she had seen the results for herself.  While doing a clientaposs make up for a th birthday party, the woman told Haleigh sheaposd been on the waiting list for a gastric bypass in Ireland for nine years. Not wanting to wait that long, Haleigh started researching private clinics and just one month after ing from Portugal in August , she applied to the Nordbariatric Clinic in Kaunas, Lithuania. However, when she contacted the clinic, she was told she needed to lose three stone on her own before going under the kne to reduce the risk of the operation. So for the next  months, she stuck to a primarily liquid diet and managed to get herself down to st lb by July  - and she travelled to Lithuania to have the operation which cost £,. The procedure involves creating a small pouch at the top of the stomach connected to the small intestines, which makes the patient feel fuller after eating less food - and meaning they absorb fewer calories.She said: I wasn’t nervous at all about the operation.Even when the surgeon came to see me, I didn’t have any questions. I felt so confident after watching the surgery being done on the clinic’s Facebook page and reading testimonials about it.The surgeon performed  procedures in the two days I was in the clinic. He was so experienced that I knew I was in safe hands. After having the operation, Haleigh was on a diet of baby food and yoghurt while her stomach recovered. A week later she was allowed to fly back home to Ireland - and was already lbs lighter than when sheaposd flown out. Just months after the operation, Haleigh was slim enough to be able to start doing cardio exercise - and a few months after that, she was able to incorporate weights into her routine too.  As the weight fell off her, Haleigh barely recognised herself - but losing so much weight so quickly left her with some excess skin. Now weighing in at st lbs and fitting into size  clothes, Haleigh is looking to have her extra skin removed, and has her eye on Lithuania again. She said: “Since I’ve been training properly in the gym, I’ve really noticed how bad my loose skin is. I just want it off me now. My body is toning up underneath, but then I have these great folds and flaps of skin. It’s my arms that are the worst. I’m really confident with my size and shape, but still have to have something covering my arms at all times as they bother me so much. The operation, which sheaposs booked for October at the same clinic, will cost £,. Haleigh said: “I just have so much more confidence now. I love going for walks and out on adventures. Before all this I couldn’t even walk down the road without getting out of breath or my back hurting. Now I love taking exercise.

Patients are routinely waiting more than two days for a bed at the emergency department, the BBC reports.Have you been affected by serious and long delays in AE  Get in touch newsdesk@mirror We have witnessed senior experienced staff crying with frustration and anger as they have had to resuscitate patients in the waiting room, examine in the viewing room and CT changing room, seen patients leave the department as they have been pulled out of a cubicle to allow someone more unwell to be treated in their former space and patients die without the dignity of privacy, the letter, signed by the clinical director Graham Ellis, the matron, two managers and the business manager, said. The trust said staff and patient welfare was its priority. But the letter continued: This means that at most times there is limited or no space to accommodate new acutely ill patients causing ambulance handover delays of over four hours and delay in treatment.  Patients, often elderly with multiple co-morbidities, have to sit in the waiting room, some for over  hours waiting for a cubicle space and treatment. Patients wait outside the department as there is no space to socially distance in the waiting room. Staff are mentally drained and despite their best efforts have seen patients suffer and have received negative comments from distraught relatives and carers, the note claimed.  The AE managers claim that they are expected to take patients even when other wards close their doors.A statement from trustaposs chief executive, Kevin McGee, said: The safety of patients and the welfare of staff remain the trustaposs top priorities but like NHS providers across the country, our hospitals have continued to sustain unprecedented pressure which has been exacerbated by the Covid- pandemic.The Mirror has contacted the trust for further comment.

They said trees between their properties in Renfrewshire, Scotland had ruined their enjoyment of their £, family home. It was also claimed that foliage from the trees had blocked drains and damaged their property. They applied to Renfrewshire Council to have the hedge cut down, but were left disappointed when the move was rejected. The couple then appealed the ruling to the Scottish Government who have now said the trees should be lopped to ft.  In an appeal document, the Shorts said: As the hedge has not been maintained by the owner for over  years, it has become massively overgrown in both height and width. Due to the height and width, professional tree surgeons would be required to maintain the hedge which now signicantly overhangs our property. There are also potential costs with damage to property with branches now growing near gutters and roofline. Allowing this hedge to keep growing will bring continued costs to us. We have tried to get this unmaintained hedge brought under control, through dialogue with the owner. Her own evidence confirms that she hasnapost touched the hedge for  years and her responses to us shows she has no desire to do the neighbourly thing. In dialogue with our neighbour and the council, we have always stated that we donapost want the hedge to be removed, we just requested for it to be brought under control to allow us to enjoy our space and right to sunlight into our garden and main living room.  They added: Another example is higher energy bills due to the lights and heating in the lounge having to be on more due to the poor light entering the front of the property. Documents sent to the council revealed Wylie did not think the trees caused any aposrestriction of the enjoymentapos on the Shorts garden. She also claimed that trees afforded her aposprivacyapos and provided aposenvironmental benefitapos to nesting birds and bats and added that the trees were present long before the Shorts property had been built. Rejecting the Shortsapos bid to have the trees lopped, Renfrewshire Council said: As a result of the position of the hedge in relation to the front garden, it is considered that the subject hedge does not result in a signicant adverse impact upon the reasonable enjoyment of the applicantaposs property, which would warrant the serving of a high hedge notice. But overturning the council decision, government reporter Trevor Croft said: During my site inspection I saw a signicant amount of overhanging of the appeal property by the hedge and given its proximity to the garden this would be impossible to avoid. Close to the hedge when standing on the driveway, and particularly when coming down the external stair, this could lead to an oppressive feeling. I allow the appeal and issue a high hedge notice. I have considered all the other matters raised but there are none which would lead me to alter my conclusions. Work on the trees must be carried out by September this year.

Images from the scene showed hundreds of red plastic packages scattered over the road and the pavement.It comes after hundreds of stuffed animals were left strewn across a motorway last week, causing delays to drivers and drawing comparisons to Toy Story.The mystery spillage, which saw around  cuddly toys, including a Winne the Pooh bear, a Minion and several My Little Ponies, left transport officials in Oregon, US, scratching their heads. The blockage occurred around .am last Wednesday, resulting in a back up of vehicles on the interstate near the Burnside Bridge. Oregon Department of Transportation compared the incident to the Disney Pixar film series, joking the toys may have been on their way to Pizza Planet. Don Hamilton, DOT spokesperson, said one lane was closed to the cartoon creatures but said most of them were already to the side of the road. “It’s not often we get several hundred stuffed animals visiting our highways,” he added. It was not immediately clear where the toys came from. Hamilton claried they had, however, been taken to the North Portland maintenance yard for care and feeding. Twitter users were keen to get in on the joke, with one replying: Be sure to check under any traffic cones!He was referring to the scene in Toy Story  in which some of Andyaposs toys hide under traffic cones as they cross a busy road on their way to rescuing Buzz Lightyear.

Itaposs thought they were together for around six months in  before the story broke that Harry was dating Meghan - an actress from the hit TV show Suits.This meant that one of the first times Meghan came to London from Toronto to stay with Harry, they did their best to try not to draw attention to themselves. So they picked an unusual spot for one of their early dates - a supermarket. And they pretended not to know each other to try and stay incognito. Speaking about the date last year on Dax Shepard’s ‘Armchair Expert’ podcast, Harry said: There’s people looking at me, giving me all these weird looks, and coming up to me and saying ‘hi’.“I texted her saying aposis this the right one,apos and she said aposno you want parchment paper,apos and Iaposm like whereaposs the parchment paper ! “I had a baseball cap on, looking down at the floor, trying to stay incognito.

Since that early date, Meghan and Harry have married, spent time as working royals, had two children and now have a new le together in Calornia. On the same podcast, Harry revealed how he can take Archie on the back of his bicycle, something he says he never had the chance to do in the UK. He explained: Living here now I can actually lt my head and actually I feel dferent, my shoulders have dropped, so have hers, you can walk around feeling a little bit more free. Since moving to Calornia, Harry has only ed to the UK twice - for the funeral of his grandfather Prince Philip and to unveil a statue of his late mother Princess Diana. Meghan and son Archie have yet toand daughter Lilibet has never been to Britain after being born in America.This meant that last week, Harry and Meghan missed a memorial service for his grandfather Prince Philip at Westminster Abbey. The couple also opted against releasing a statement or a tribute to Harryaposs grandfather to mark the day. It came amid a row over their security in the UK, as Harry has said it isnapost safe for him to bring his family here. He is currently taking legal action against the Home Office to reverse the decision against giving him and his family police protection while they are in the UK - and says he is willing to pay for this. A legal representative for the Duke said: “ Prince Harry inherited a security risk at birth, for le. He remains sixth in line to the throne, served two tours of combat duty in Afghanistan, and in recent years his family has been subjected to well-documented neo-Nazi and extremist threats.“While his role within the institution has changed, his profile as a member of the Royal Family has not.

The nationwide poll, conducted by the joint supplement brand for dogs,YuMOVE , found the hit TV show, starring Cillian Murphy, left a mark on the nation’s dog owners.The name Alfie swooped in at number three on the list of the top male dog names, again suggesting that Blinders-mad Brits have been inspired by Tom Hardy’s character, Jewish gang-leader, Alfie Solomans.to our TeamDogs newsletter for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories. The research was conducted in response to the recent  per cent spike in online searches for ‘adoption centres near me’ suggesting many Brits may be gearing up to welcome a new dog into their homes this spring. The male name Max stole the top spot for Brits, followed by Dave at number two – and it seems they’re not alone – sharing their preferences with some of the nation’s best loved celebrities and Hollywood superstars. Heidi Klum named her beautul German Shepherd, Max, who lives alongside her two other dogs, fellow Sheppy, Freddie and Irish Wolfhound, Anton, who she adopted on National Dog Day back in . And Gogglebox’s Malone family may well have bucked the trend after melting hearts with their Rottweiler, Dave.

Jayne Laycock, resident vet at YuMOVE, said “S pring is a popular time of year to welcome a new dog into the home. However, before you start to consider names for your new pooch, which we know people love doing, there are lots of other important decisions.Firstly, make sure you thoroughly research the traits of the breed you’re looking to buy or adopt to ensure it’s an appropriate fit for you and your lestyle. For example, some dogs require a lot more physical exercise than others, some are more suited to rural living and some will require even more specialist care and training. Likewise, consider the age of the dog you’re looking to get – puppies require a lot of time, effort and training, soyou’re looking for something a little more ‘seasoned’ - then perhaps look at a rescue dog that’s a little older that’s already house trained.

Baby Dominic who is nicknamed Doodles, has  known allergens arising from a range of foods and materials such as latex, avocado, milk and beef. He also has breathing problems and neonatal absence syndrome following a morphine addiction because of hi mumaposs disability Staff at Astbury Lane Nursery in Congleton are aware of his health problems and work with his mum to keep him safe. So when a staff member saw a red blotch on his face, they leaped into action.  On Wednesday, Dominic started a new oral medication for an allergy-related skin condition. Just hours after his first dose, he began showing the first signs of a serious allergic reaction. Staff at Astbury Lane Nursery reacted quickly and contacted mum Kerri-Louise, who instructed them to give him allergy medication. They administered the treatment within minutes of the blotch being spotted. Kerri-Louise was called to the nursery after he developed an allergy and could see it was spreading.She told CheshireLive : “I could see straight away that his lips had started swelling, his eyes were puffy, lips were a deep red. I am relaying this back to the GP, I said, ‘He’s had his allergy medication but the symptoms do seem to have spread in the   minutes it has taken me to get there.’“He wasn’t at all fighting for his breath, he just had lots of shallow, quick breathing. The nursery staff, Gemma, had put his hand on his chest, and that is when I noticed his breathing.”  The GP told Kerri-Louise she needed to take baby Dominic to the hospital. Staff remained calm and helped Dominic into his mum’s car, who was planning on driving him to Macclesfield Hospital. “Dominic was kind of smiling but quiet. He wasn’t panicked in any way,” Kerri-Louise said. “Neither were the staff. Because I was on my own, the staff carried him to the car for me and strapped him into the car seat. After getting advice from husband Carl, she decided to call an ambulance to meet them at the house as fear increased of Dominic’s symptoms getting worse.He was starting to look more unwell and was becoming lethargic, and more red blotches and patches of eczema were appearing around his face. When an ambulance arrived, they checked him over and decided to take him to hospital to keep an eye on him as his allergy medication wears off. At just one year old, Dominic knows sign language. He has learned over  dferent signs since he was just two months old. Kerri-Louise explained that she was in a car accident at  which left her left leg paralysed and also resulted in spinal damage. She said: “He was born with a morphine addiction because of my disability. It’s neonatal abstinence syndrome, and when you go into withdrawal, your body shakes and you get angry because you need something that you can’t have. “My older sonhas the same thing. So we did sign language with the both of them because although they can’t speak, they can sign from six or seven months old. “Very handy ones have been ‘hurt’, ‘doctor’ and ‘medicine’. He can do animals and really fun ones as well like ‘monkey’ or ‘dog. But the main things we needed him to know were things like ‘medicine’, that would really help us.” While waiting for treatment, Dominic was signing that his head hurt, signalling to his parents that he possibly had a headache due to the reaction. Sign language is an important part of managing Dominic’s health, and the nursery have not shied away from embracing this. They have learned to understand some of the signs to help accommodate Dominic’s needs. Kerri-Louise said: “The nursery have learned sign language to be able to communicate with him as well. He’s probably been there about six months. He started in their baby room, and the baby staff learned sign language because he had been signing since he was about two months old.” Now Dominic has moved to the baby-toddler room with new staff who have embraced the language. His mum continued: “Within that room, he can actually sign a sentence, he can do two or three signs now. So unfortunately, theyhave got the harder job and they have to learn more signs to keep up with him.” Fortunately, due to the medication being administered so early on in the reaction, Dominic’s symptoms did not progress much further. He was discharged from hospital relatively quickly, and the doctor said that they were ‘lucky’ that the reaction had not been worse. Kerri-Louise said: “She was surprised that his throat didn’t close up on him, it could have been a full anaphylactic shock. But it wasn’t, the reaction paused at face swelling.” She is grateful that the staff were so quick in their reaction, especially nursery worker Olivia. The mum added: “She wasn’t tied with Dominic in any way. He wasn’t her responsibility. She’s gone out of her way to know… all his medication, all his health history. She got to know him that well that she could spot something so quickly and know it was serious. That just says everything about that nursery, they are a million miles ahead. They just treat them like family.” The reaction had the potential to be deadly, as it was completely out-of-the-blue and the symptoms were the “most serious”. But the staff at Astbury Lane Nurseryaposs actions saved baby ‘Doodles’’ le. Kerri-Louise explained that the nursery has been incredible with his allergies, and this incident is just a testament to their care and quality. She said: “When I mentioned his health problems, it was never a problem. Nothing is too much for this nursery, they have made something that was so so dficult at home, such a worry, they made it easy. “When he goes to nursery, I don’t worry, because I know for a fact that they will look after him.” It took a week for Dominic’s symptoms to subside, but the situation could have been a lot worse had the nursery not reacted so fast. Nursery Manager, Kate Smithers, said she is ‘proud’ of the team. She said: “After the girls noticed the mark on Dominic’s face, they instantly reacted by giving him the care and treatment needed. The team are incredible and the way they took control of the situation and knew that something wasn’t right, is a detriment to how seriously they take their role. “From the moment they noticed the mark, to the emergency medication being administered was literally a few minutes. Throughout, they remained calm, focused and worked together as a team to support one another, Dominic and also his mother, Kerri.

A statement said: “We have been working to protect the Omo Forest Reserve in Nigeria since  and this is one of the last remaining places in Nigeria where forest elephants still survive. “Visitors are therefore still helping protect elephants when they visit our zoo, even though we no longer have any here.” Last year – when there were  elephants in  zoos across the UK – it was reported that keeping elephants in zoos or safari parks would be phased out. Importation of new elephants would be prohibited and the existing population would be allowed to die out naturally. The news delighted campaigners who said that elephants, which are highly intelligent animals, suffer from mental illness in zoos.The RSPCA said it also causes them physical ailments such as crippling arthritis.They only live for an average of  years in captivity, compared with more than  years in the wild, where they live in large herds with highly complex social lives, and some travel hundreds of miles each year.

His only real problem is that he is consistent at making bad choices, and perhaps in time the worst of all will be when he decidednotto relinquish his motheraposs hand at the Westminster Abbey memorial for his father, to let her be led to her seat by someone  as he quietly slipped into his own.Instead Andrew kept her hand, eyeballed the Dean of Westminster into backing down, and flaunted the Head of the Church of England in front of a bank of TV cameras in the full knowledge that his fatheraposs memorial would be reduced to a news item re-upping allegations of sexual abuse.Worse than the public criticism, though, was the well-briefed fury of Charles and William, the next two monarchs who will not be as forgiving as the current one. And then the entirely-coincidental revelation that Andrew had not mended his ways, and had become embroiled with another scandal.This time itaposs a court case in which he, his ex-we and both his daughters are alleged to have been the beneficiaries of a grand swindle. A Turkish banker allegedly persuaded a Turkish millionairess to trust her cash to him, and she has told the court that he used the money to buy influence for himself with the Royals.The Turkish banker was applauded at the princeaposs now-defunct Pitch@Palace initiative, and around the same time Andrew received £.m, his ex-we £,, and his daughter Eugenie a further £,.The millionairess says she was told the money was for a passport. Coutts says they were told it was to pay for Beatriceaposs wedding. This is despite the fact a passport costs £., and Beatrice married a millionaire.  Andrew has now repaid the £,, but a further £, is unaccounted for. The Duchess of York has refused toher chunk, on the grounds it was paid for her work as a brand ambassador for a green energy company, even though it does not seem to be benefitting much from the connection. Beatriceaposs friends have described her as completely unaware of how her wedding was paid for, while Eugenie has let it be known she spent the £, on a surprise birthday party for her mother.And the question must now be asked of the entire family: what is it about dodgy money that attracts you Becausea £, bill for a wedding was settled by a Turkish political exile, any other bride would know about it. If any other woman got six-figure sums from her ex-husbandaposs chums she might wonder why. Andany one of us wanted to throw a surprise party and found it cost the same as a new car, weaposd throw a smaller onewe didnapost have the means to pay for it. Now the Royal Family finds itself in the unenviable situation of having paid £.million between them to make a scandal go away, just as the Duke of York manages to drive them smack into a new one - one which makes them look entitled, opportunistic, and desperate for cash to supplement a lestyle they cannot afford.At a time when the rest of the nation knows to the nearest penny what they can afford, and are turning off the heating or adjusting their shopping habits to scrape by, the fact that the future Royal Family canapost imagine a wedding that costs less than three quarters of a million pounds is not going to improve its long-term chances of survival.The timing of this court case, which has rumbled on for a couple of years, suddenly being made public in the week after Andrew embarrassed his relatives is interesting. And it may be linked to the fact that the Duke, who just a few months ago confirmed his public appearance at the memorial would be the last, is now reportedly considering smearing his pudgy chops across the Derby, a Falklands anniversary event, and the Platinum Jubilee. Why would a man who vowed to step away from the spotlight now be so intent on hogging it  Read more Prince Andrew is a true pauper prince - a man of poor wit, poor talent, and poor judgement. All that makes him rich is his title, and after giving up every other honoric his HRH is the one thing he has held onto. He is not allowed to use it, but he does still have it.He also held on to his daughtersapos titles, when other siblings relinquished them in favour of a more normal le. He fought for his daughtersapos Royal security, when it was costing £m a year and creating bad news as Met police officers were forced to trail after two girls on their gap yahs. For all the criticism levelled at Harry and Meghan for trying to trade off their Royal titles, Andrew and Sarah of York have done exactly that for decades, and with far more disastrous consequences. It perhaps explains why sheaposs still Sarah of York. Whoaposd want to change their name,it would cost you the chance to earn £, without having to go down the pit  Having lost his reputation, his ski chalet, millions of pounds and the trust of most of his wider family, Andrew seems to be intent on reinventing himself - not as a changed or chastened man, but as a prince, who needs to show no humility or shame. With the Queen by his side, Andrew can try it. But he has underestimated two things. The first is the fury of the British public, which does not forgive sexual misconduct in public le that easily, still less so when it involves someone legally a child. And the second is the ruthlessness of monarchy - the one quality which has been passed through that family since William the Conqueror. Charles may go easy on his younger brother, but William seems to feel nothing but scorn for playboy princes with dubious means of financial support. There will not be space on William Vaposs balcony for Uncle Andrew, nor much patience with the York familyaposs inability to adjust their lestyle to suit their income. Andrew is therefore working against the clock -being a prince is what turns a buck, then how much of a prince can he be, in the time his mother has left  The answer must be: for as long as her family lets the Queen be so exploited.Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Sarah FergusonPrince Philip, Duke of EdinburghPrince Andrew, Duke of YorkRoyal Family\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

One clip shows the creepy Huggy Wuggy singing about hugging and killing and asking viewers to take their last breath - and itaposs worrying parents whose children have been copying the video while in the school playground, reports Belfast Live.Cregagh Primary School in East Belfast warned parents of the trend and asked them to be vigilant around what children are watching.  In a post on the schoolaposs Facebook page, principal David Hegarty said: It has been brought to my attention that a character named aposHuggy Wuggyapos is being viewed by our children online, some as young as Primary One. The character can be easily viewed on YouTube channels and is a teddy bear with razor sharp teeth that sings worrying songs about hugging and killing.On one of the videos the bear asks the viewer to take their last breath. It is a very deceiving characters, as hugs should be seen as something kind and loving, and because of its name is able to infiltrate firewalls and filters. I just wanted to inform parents so you are aware and can be vigilant around what your children could be watching.The same post was also shared to the Facebook page of Abbotaposs Cross Primary School in Newtownabbey.

But after the -year-old had no idea she was actually pregnant and in labour and minutes later, Adrianne and her husband were delivering their son Apollo on the bathroom floor. Adrianne, from Dallas, Texas, said the surprise birth came as a complete shock as the little lad, who weighed a healthy lbs oz, arrived.She had no prenatal symptoms and didnapost gain any weight during her pregnancy back in  - in fact she actually lost lbs in the first two months. Adrianne even revealed that her husband underwent a vasectomy earlier this month to make sure a surprise like -month-old baby Apollo doesnapost happen again. Adrianne - who has six children with her husband-of-ten years including a -year-old step-daughter from her husbandaposs previous relationship - says: With my other pregnancies, I had all the regular symptoms but I had nothing with Apollo. I had a huge bump with my other kids. I actually had some hip issues during my other pregnancies due to the weight I was carrying with the babies. I knew what pregnancy looked and felt like but I had absolutely no idea I was expecting Apollo!Whilst I was pregnant with Apollo, I had been on a serious health kick, eating well and working out every morning. Throughout my pregnancy, I was fitting into all my usual clothes and my tightest pair of shorts! In the first two months of being pregnant, I actually lost weight. I started at lbs and then went down to lbs before going back to lbs again. But around two months prior to giving birth, I did start to experience bloating from time to time. I havenapost got the best digestive system and often had bloating with certain foods, so I didnapost think anything of it. Adrianne - who is a mommy blogger under the username @momofawholelottakids on Instagram as well as the creator of a clothing label - says she started to have painful cramps and excessive bloating in the  hours leading up to Apolloaposs birth.Adrianne did yoga and took a bath in a bid to ease her discomfort. She then decided to use the toilet to try to poop for relief - but instead she left the bathroom with a newborn baby. Adrianne - whose youngest child was a year old when she gave birth to Apollo in September last year - says: I started to have really painful bloating on the day I gave birth. As the day wore on, I began having really bad stomach pain which I attributed to pre-menstrual cramps but they just didnapost stop. I did some yoga in the afternoon to ease my pain and got in the tub thinking my cramps would subside.  I did worry that maybe I should go to the emergency room because I was in so much pain. Now I realise those cramps were contractions and I had probably been in labour for several hours. Anyway, I came out of the tub and sat on the toilet thinking maybe I had to poop something out. But when I thought I had just pooped, I heard something pop. Immediately, I was like thataposs not my water breaking right  I put my hand in and I felt a babyaposs head. Suddenly my instinct clicked in, I went into emergency mode and I knew I had to deliver this baby. I pushed really hard. I swear that within what felt like five minutes, the baby was out and I was holding Apollo in my hands. It was honestly like holding an alien at the time because I couldnapost believe what I was seeing! I screamed for my husband. He came running into the bathroom and saw the baby that I was holding. I remember him just looking at me in complete shock. The only words that come out of his mouth were Oh my godapos. I told my husband to call my midwe immediately. At am, my midweaposs birth assistant came and helped me and Apollo get cleaned up. When Apollo arrived, I genuinely felt relief because I finally knew what was causing my cramps. Apollo was my easiest pregnancy for sure. I was eating so healthy and working out regularly that I wonderthat was the reason I didnapost have my usual big pregnancy bump and tiredness with him. Apollo is such a chilled baby and he fits into our family perfectly. But six kids is definitely enough for now!

When she was seven years old, Vanessa had her hair cut short. She hated how it looked, and pledged never to cut her hair again. As her locks grew longer and longer, she became used to compliments and accrued an online following for her Rapunzel-like hairstyle.Vanessa – who has a daughter Rose,  and son, Jasper,  with her husband,  – told News Dog Media : “When I was seven, I got my hair cut and hated it and promised myself that I would never cut it short again. “I loved having long hair and I was curious to see how long it would grow. I never expected that my hair would grow to my calves! “But it just kept growing. In fact, I saw the most growth in my hair when I had my two kids. “People began to compliment me on my long hair all the time. I was noticed for my long hair and it became tied up in my identity and self-worth. “Of course, sometimes it felt nice to have a compliment but increasingly it started to make me feel uncomfortable. “I wished that people would see that there was more to me than my hair. “My long hair had served me well for so many years. But after doing a lot of soul-searching, I realised it was no longer serving me and it was actually causing me more resistance in my le. “I was becoming a dferent person to who I used to be when I was seven years old.“I wanted to try something dferent and let go of that identity. Part of that transformation meant letting go of hair. “My four-foot long hair had always made me stand out. But I no longer wanted to be viewed just for my hair, I wanted to be viewed as a person.” In November last year, Vanessa secretly went to the hairdresser. She revealed her hair transformation to the world when she shocked her , TikTok followers with her short bob. She explains: “I only told a handful of people including my husband before I cut my hair. “I didn’t want anyone’s opinion to affect my decision. I wanted to cut my hair for me. “I was excited but nervous about getting the chop. I was shocked when I first saw it gone but I was also surprised that I felt pretty and confident with short hair too. “Also I had never realised the sheer weight of my long hair on my neck for all those years. It was so light now.Vanessa unveiled her dramatic haircut on TikTok with trepidation, and was worried that she would lose social media followers. But whilst trolls attacked her haircut, she also gained followers who were impressed by her bold decision. Now she wants to inspire other women to make liberating changes in their le as well. Vanessa says: “I was scared people would unfollow me when I cut my hair. Butanything, that solidied my decision to go to the hairdresser. I had to face my fear that some people only cared about my hair. “When I revealed my transformation on TikTok, of course there were people who told me I wasn’t special or unique anymore without my long hair. Some users threatened to unfollow me, whilst others tried to console me by telling me my hair would grow back. “But I actually got way more follows from my haircut video because it was so extreme. It was quite cool to see that!“Cutting my hair made me face lots of beliefs I had about myself. It made me see the beauty in myself – beyond my hair. “It made me realise my worth doesn’t change according to what I wear or how I look. “I want to show women that their worth doesn’t depend on certain attributes either. You’re amazing because you’re you. “I hope my decision allows other people to examine themselves too and seethey are holding on to things that might be negative. Letting go brought me so much joy. “I’m really loving my short hair right now. Maybe I’ll grow it again someday but definitely not anytime soon!” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Viral\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

As she and her new husband are both historians - who met through their research of the Regency era - they wanted their wedding to look just like something out of Bridgerton, as a way to honour our beginnings. When it came to her maid of honour, the -year-old bride decided on her childhood friend Jessica, who happens to have tattoos on her hands, legs, torso, and neck.When she asked Jessica what she intended to do about the tattoos on the big day so as to be in keeping with the traditional look, Jessica replied that, although she understood how important the theme was to the couple, she wasnapost going to be covering up her body art. Although the bride admits she was a little mfed by this reluctance, she didnapost push things any further and wanted to respect Jessicaaposs boundaries. She also wasnapost too worried, as the bridesmaids would be wearing gloves, meaning only her neck tattoos would be visible. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. However, on the day itself, Jessica turned up wearing short gloves rather than the long ones the bride had expected, meaning her arm tattoos were on full display. Sheaposd also had her neckline unexpectedly adjusted at the last minute, taking her by surpriseTaking to Reddit, she recalled: I did not expect this and was kind of thrown off, but after a while, I stopped caring and was busy having the best day of my le.However fast forward to a few weeks ago, I got back the first set of pictures from my wedding day and the pics with Jessica in them were jarring, to say the least, because of her tattoos. It was honestly so out of place since I had asked my photographer to edit the pics to give them a historic portrait-like look. I wanted a particular pic of my husband and I, our families plus maid of honour and best man framed. However,anyone saw that pic the first thing they would’ve noticed was Jessica’s tattoos, and not my husband and I.The poster, who goes by the username u NefariousnessSafe, continued: I really wanted this one particular picture to look like an actual portrait drawn in  so I went ahead and asked the photographer to digitally remove the tattoos.The post-Photoshop pic came in the mail yesterday and I showed it to Jessica, I knew she would get annoyed with this and I was ready to apologize sincerely, but also let her know that I wonapost be ing the picture. Jessica was very very mad when she saw the pic and told me this was a narcissistic and disrespectful thing to do and stormed out of my house, she was madder than I ever expected her to be so now I’m not sureI was truly way out of line, or just a little bit selfish. Giving further clarication, the poster explained that she believes Jessicaaposs tattoos to be beautul and uniquely her, but simply felt they didnapost fit in with the theme of the ceremony. Her fellow Reddit users have sympathised with her position, agreeing that, as artistic as Jessicaaposs tattoos may well be, she shouldnapost have changed her neckline or gloves without first discussing it. They wrote: Franklyshe wasn’t willing to wear the clothes the poster provided then she should have declined being in the wedding party. Another said: You were wearing period costumes that you paid for and she modied herswithout your consent. The bride and groom are supposed to be the focus of attention at their own wedding, but she dominated the pictures because she insisted on displaying tattoos. If she couldnapost respect your wishes, then you have every right to mody any and all pictures to be consistent with that period and to keep the focus on yourself and your husband.Do you have a wedding-related story to share  We pay for stories.

Jamie, , tried to whip out his camera to get a photo of the beast but it ducked under the surface before he got the chance to get a picture.Warren and Jamieaposs sighting is the second time Nessie has been spotted this year, as an aposexpertapos recorded an official sighting after spotting apostwo objects moving parallel to each otherapos.What do you think about the Loch Ness Monster  Let us know in the comments...Producer and filmmaker Warren, of Newbiggin-by-the-Sea, Northumberland, said: Unbelievable as this sounds, me and Jamie saw something very large in the loch. I saw something like a very large upturned boat out of the corner of my eye about m away from the shoreline, then Jamie shouted stop. He saw it fully and said it looked like a very dark whale - a hump. By the time I stopped the car, a few metres later, trees were covering our view, I quickly reversed, Jamie jumped out.  But all he got on his phone camera were very large circular ripples, but in the exact spot the aposcreatureapos had been. And as we watched it looked like ‘it’ was moving away from us underwater before totally disappearing a few moments later. If we had arrived literally  seconds earlier, we would have caught this properly on camera. We were absolutely gutted that we missed what would have been a genuinely historic picture. “But also amazed at what we had both seen as we were both very sceptical about previous sightings.  As we are actually here in Loch Ness filming a documentary on all of the strange occurrences in the area, we expect ridicule and disbelief but we both know exactly what we saw. Nessie hunter Steve Feltham, who we met later in the day, agreed our experience sounded and looked like a genuine sighting similar to others over the years. And Jamie has logged it with the Register of Nessie sightings. Jamie, of Gateshead, added: I looked towards then cemetery and then the large object or creature in the loch caught my eye. At first I thought it was a big boulder or something, I said to my friend driving ‘Whataposs that itaposs huge ’ The object creature was reflecting the water so looked wet, almost like a whale skin crossed with a fish skin, it was dark in colour - darker than the water surrounding it.

There were dark greys, black, browns in colour, it almost looked like how a whale hump might look breaking the surface minus the fin. There was a definite movement but didnapost see too much of the movement before trees obscured it, it was a very big size at least  foot long, maybe bigger, around the middle of the loch. The earliest sighting of the monster was recorded by Saint Columba in . But Nessiemania really took hold in  when George Spicer and his we claimed a ft-long beast crossed the road in front of his car.

She hoped it would apostake some years offapos and she had the treatment done before parentaposs evening at her -year-old sonaposs school. But after the treatment Mariana, from Northampton, East Midlands, took a turn for the worse and her face swelled up - and when she went to the school her son couldnapost recognise her. What do you think of the treatment  Let us know in the comments...Mariana, from Northampton, East Midlands, said: I wanted to take a couple of years off, hoping Iaposd look like I was turning  instead of . Iaposve got really droopy eyelids on the top and they literally hang on my eyelashes and I can see it - so itaposs not just looking at it, it literally annoys me for my vision. Iaposve also got excess skin and dark circles under my eyes so I was hoping that would help tighten the skin a little bit because itaposs dficult to put make-up on because thereaposs so much skin.Right after I just had red skin and little dots but when I woke up the next morning it was really, really swollen. On the second day I woke up it was super swollen everywhere - top and bottom - and then as the day progressed and the next day the swelling stayed but then my eyes became quite droopy as well. I knew what I was expecting but it was still a shock waking up and realising aposIaposve got to go to parentsapos evening and face my childaposs teachers looking like thatapos.  The teachers asked meI had an allergic reaction and I said aposno Iaposm just trying to look youngerapos. The mum-of-four says she couldnapost help but laugh about her extremely swollen eyes and having to face the teachers on parentsapos evening just one day after the appointment. Most of her family also found it funny, but she says her -year-old son seemed to uncover an unknown phobia, with the sight of the burnt dots around her eyes made him feel aposuncomfortableapos.

This left the teen unable to be in the same room as his mum for a few days and still unable to look at her face on Motheraposs Day. Mariana said: My family thought it was really funny but my son must have a fear of holes or something because he literally couldnapost even look at me or be in the same room as me. It made him feel really uncomfortable and it was funny because it was Motheraposs Day on Sunday and he was worried about how he was going to spend it with me, looking like that. Luckily some of the spots had gone by then and he could at least be in the same room as me evenhe couldnapost look at me. The anti-ageing treatment works by targeting the collagen and protein-producing cells in the skin, stimulating them and causing the area to tighten up. The hot current creates small holes in the skin’s layer which have to be allowed to heal properly to avoid complications like scarring and pigmentation.

While most owners struggle through their petaposs final moments, others choose to avoid it and wait in the hallway for it all to be over. Although it might be easier for you to sit it out, you might want to reconsider and put yourself through the pain of watching for their benefit.A vet has shared a heartbreaking message to owners who leave their pets alone when theyaposre being put to sleep - and is urging them to stay with them no matter how dficult it is. to our TeamDogs newsletter for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories. Speaking to Reddit, one vet said: It might be hard to say goodbye but it’s hell for them. They already don’t like the vet, they’re confused, they’re scared, they’re sad and they’re looking for you when they take their last breath. I can try to provide them as much love and comfort as I humanly can but at the end of the day, I’m a stranger to them. Explaining how a woman dropped off her -year-old dog to be euthanised, the vet said the poor pooch spent its final moments desperately scanning the room for her owner. She added: I told her we didn’t have a vet in clinic as she was on farm calls all day, but she insisted on leaving her there at am knowing that our vet wouldn’t be back until well after pm. She was too busy to bring her back later, so she left her sweet girl to be alone all day before dying.  I kept her with me for most of the day, took her for a small walk, bought her a cheeseburger and donut on my lunch and laid on the ground and cuddled her while she cried, scared and confused. I kissed her and told her she was a good girl while she crossed the rainbow bridge, but her eyes never stopped looking for her family. Dogs know what’s happening, don’t do this to them. Be there when they cross that bridge. It won’t kill you, I promise.Sharing their sympathies with those unable to stay with their pets as the injection is administered, the vet stressed: This very obviously does not apply to anyone who had absolutely no choice during the pandemic.While most users thanked the vet for their honestly, others recalled their own heartbreaking experiences with having to say goodbye to a beloved pet.One user said: While it is one of the hardest things we ever have to do, itaposs our last gt of love to them, after a letime of devotion. We stopped at McDonaldaposs and I ordered her a chocolate sundae. She had refused food for two days prior, but had a tentative, single lick of the chocolate while we cuddled her. My vet is one of the kindest people alive. He comes out to our car and gives her a big cuddle. He positions us so I can cuddle her and look into her eyes as she passes. He wants the last thing she sees to be me reassuring her. He checks her heart beat and steps away to let us have a private moment together, and I can hear him behind his own car having a quite cry to himself. He goes back in to treat his next patient, and when I am ready I go in to thank him. He cries again, I cry too. He gives me a hug and I head home with my lovely girl, to place her with her mates who went before her. Another added: I recently held my sweet little angel baby as her body went limp in my arms. A piece of me died that day but she was surrounded by love and died peacefully in my arms feeling safe. I cannot fathom not being there for her as she drew her last breaths. We truly don’t deserve the love, adoration and loyalty of dogs. A third said: I lost two dogs and a cat this year and my we and I rearrange our schedules to be with them as much as possible before they were put down and we were there during the procedures. It was horrible but we had them for  and  years so they were family. While I can understand not wanting to acknowledge that itaposs happening and wanting to pretend that they are just in the other room, trust me that itaposs better to be there for every second you can for closure and support.

Morgan, from the US, visited a hairdresser last year in the hopes of bagging a stylish platinum blonde look but was left devastated when she left the salon with disastrous results.In a video, the woman said: I think it’s hysterical now I look back on it but at the time it was super traumatic for me. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. The person who did my hair had apparently been doing hair for  years. They told me she specialised in blonde and I was like aposOk cool, I want to be blonde blonde … I want to be platinum.apos But Morgan, who posts on TikTok under the username @morganjade, was then told by her stylist that she wouldnapost be able to have the style sheaposd asked, and the pair had a back and forth for some time about what she could have done instead.Eventually, Morgan agreed to settle for a balayage, which is a technique of applying highlights to the hair and would prevent the stylist from bleaching Morganaposs whole head - which could have damaged her hair because of how dark her base colour was. The woman allowed her hairdresser to finish her hair without her looking at it so she could be surprised at the end, but warning bells began ringing when she was told there were still spots left that needed touching up.She explained in another video: She blowdries my hair and straightens it for me and all the while I’m not looking at it. She’s got me turned around and I don’t what to see it until it’s done. I was getting excited. She was like, aposthere’s definitely some spots I want to touch up, so we’re going to let your hair rest and then next week, I’m going to have you come in and I’m going to touch these spots up.apos So I was like spots  She turns me around and I saw exactly what she meant. I was in utter disbelief. I was in shock. My face, I’m sure it was just white - pale as a ghost.  Instead of the flowing blonde that Morgan had hoped for, she was left with chunky blonde highlights that stopped abruptly before her roots, as well as several patches that resembled leopard print spots. She added: I felt sick to my stomach instantly, there were spots like literally leopard print spots in my hair. I didn’t even have words. Morgan admitted she ended up paying the full for the service plus a small tip, even though she wasnapost happy. And after breaking down in tears when she got outside of the salon, she called her mum who advised her to go back and tell the owner of the hairdresseraposs that she wasnapost impressed - and demand they fix her hair. The woman explained she did eventually get her hair fixed by the owner of the salon, and commenters on the video were quick to offer their sympathies to her. One person said: “I’m a stylist and I don’t know how a trained professional could let someone leave like that.” While another added: Oh hell no they better have fixed your hair for free at this point, I would have freaked out.Do you have a story to sell  Get in touch with us at yourmirror@trinitymirror .Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON HairstylesUmm what Viral\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\" to FREE email alerts with news to brighten your daySubscribeInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

An emotional Volodymyr Zelensky again accused Moscow of ­genocide after he toured the devastated town of Bucha, where  residents were found dead, some bound and gagged.The Ukrainian President claimed ­thousands of people have been murdered and butchered by rampaging Russian troops since they invaded the country. As more mass graves were discovered, Mr Zelensky said: “It will be recognised by the world as genocide. We know of ­thousands of people killed and tortured, with their limbs severed, women raped and children killed.”  Speaking about the massacre in Bucha, just outside the capital Kyiv, he added: “Hundreds of people were killed, tortured. Corpses on the street, mined areas. Even the bodies of the dead were mined. “Concentrated evil has come to our land. Murderers, torturers, rapists, looters who call ­themselves the army, and who deserve only death after what they did.” But shameless Moscow officials accused Ukrainians of staging the killings. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said: “From what we have seen, our experts have identied signs of video falsication and other fakes.” Mr Zelensky has set up a special body to ­investigate Russian war crimes – a call echoed by US President Joe Biden.He said: “I decided to create a special ­mechanism of justice in Ukraine to ­investigate and prosecute every crime of the occupiers in our country.” It will include “international experts, ­investigators, ­prosecutors and judges”. More than  corpses have been ­examined by forensic ­scientists preparing dossiers for future war crimes tribunals. Intelligence chiefs have a target list of Russian troops from  infantry brigades allegedly behind atrocities in Bucha.In Motyzhyn, to the west of Kyiv, the bodies of four people who appeared to have been shot at close range were seen in a pit. Boris Johnson branded the discovery “sickening”. Keir Starmer said Russian soldiers involved in war crimes in Ukraine should know “for the rest of their lives” they will be “chased down” and prosecuted. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss last night called for Russia to be kicked off the UN’s Human Rights Council over the ­atrocities. She said: “After these appalling crimes, Russia has no place on it.”As many as  schools daily have been hit by warplanes since the invasion started, Save The ­Children revealed. More than two million kids have fled while around . million remain. Up to , ­civilians are still unable to leave the besieged town of Mariupol. Grim ­statistics reveal  children have been killed and  injured.  Ukraine’s foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba said the port city had suffered an even worse onslaught than Bucha. He added: “The horrors we have seen in Bucha are just the tip of the iceberg of all the crimes that have been committed by the Russian army in Ukraine.” An evacuation convoy escorted by the International Committee of the Red Cross was blocked in the town of Manhush as it attempted to reach Mariupol last night. Kharkiv resident Olena Kolesnik, who fled to Poland, said: “This is genocide. This is fascism.

Honest media outlets have been shut down, and protests against the war cracked down upon with speed and severity. So the Russian people from Moscow in the west to Yakutsk in the east, from Archangel in the far north Arctic Circle to Irkutsk down south near the Mongolian border have no idea of what is really happening in Ukraine. Since the Russian invaded Ukraine on February , many Mirror readers have been asking what they can do to help. And while many have kindly donated to the Disasters Emergency Committee: Ukraine Appeal and offered to take desperate Ukrainian refugees into your own homes, it still does not feel like enough. Дорогой русский друг,Мы пишем тебе, потому что хотим, чтобы ты знал правду о войне на Украине.Великобритания — друг российского народа. Мы играем с вашими футбольными командами и пьем русскую водку. Мы знаем, что вы хорошие люди, которые хотят жить в мире и видеть, как ваши дети растут счастливыми, здоровыми и заботятся о других.Но мы также знаем, что в России нет свободной прессы, и вас ежедневно кормят ложью о войне в Украине.Поэтому вы можете не знать, что тысячи невинных людей, включая женщин и детей, подвергаются резне. Или что российские войска ушли из Киева, оставив свидетельства казней многих гражданских лиц. Некоторым стреляли в спину, когда они были связаны по рукам и ногам. Нам также очень жаль говорить вам, что женщины подвергались насилию, иногда на глазах у своих же детей.Мы знаем, что ваших сыновей, братьев и парней против их воли призывают воевать на Украине. К сожалению, жизни многих ваших молодых людей уже потеряны, и мы глубоко опечалены скорбью из-за этой ужасной войны.Пожалуйста, поверьте, что эта война, начатая Владимиром Путиным, незаконна, и её осудила уже  страна мира. Ваш президент врёт, когда говорит, что Украина представляет угрозу для России и полна нацистов.Если вы не можете или не хотите верить тому, что мы пишем, тогда, пожалуйста, хотя бы задайте себе вопросы, которые должны таиться в вашей душе. Почему ваш президент заставил замолчать свободную прессу  Почему ваших молодых людей посылают на смерть  Кому выгодна эта война Мы уверены, что вы, как и мы, не хотите, чтобы гибли люди, чтобы дети росли сиротами, чтобы семьи разрывались на части.Мы призываем вас быть на стороне дружбы между народами.Во имя мира,Читатели Daily Mirror So today we are printing a letter written in Russian which you can send to ordinary Russians to enlighten them of the truth and hopefully begin to combat President Vladimir Putin ’s lies.Our letter says: “We know you are good people who want to live in peace and watch your children grow up to be happy, healthy and care about others.But we also know there is no free press in Russia and your leaders are cheating you with a daily diet of lies about the war in Ukraine. Your President is not telling the truth.” The Russian people are not even aware of the heavy losses their own forces - their own sons, brothers, fathers and uncles - have suffered in this evil conflict. Cut out our letter in Russian, pop it in an envelope and address it. Russian addresses can be found on a random address generator at: www.bestrandoms random-address-in-ru  If you do not have the internet, maybe try your local library or ask a friend to help. Posting a letter to Russia costs from £. - and it may begin to change hearts and minds among ordinary Russians who have done no wrong but are simply led by a psychopathic dictator.Dear our Russian friendsWe are writing to you because we want you to know the truth about the war in Ukraine. Britain is a friend of the Russian people. We play against your football teams and drink Russian vodka. We know you are good people who want to live in peace and watch your children grow up to be happy, healthy and care about others. But we also know there is no free press in Russia and your leaders are cheating you with a daily diet of lies about the war in Ukraine. So you may not be aware thousands of innocent people, including women and children, are being slaughtered. Or that Russian forces have withdrawn from Kyiv, leaving evidence they executed many civilians, some shot in the back while tied hand and foot. We are also very sorry to tell you women were raped, sometimes in front of their children.  We know your sons, brothers and boyfriends are being conscripted against their will to fight in Ukraine. Sadly the lives of many of your young men have been lost already and we feel sorrow for all those mourning because of this terrible war. Please believe us when we tell you this is an illegal war by Vladimir Putin that has been condemned by  countries around the world. Your President is not telling the truth when he says Ukraine is a threat to Russia and full of Nazis. If you cannot or will not believe what we write please, at least, ask yourself the questions that must lurk in your soul. Why has your President silenced the free press  Why are your young men being sent to their deaths  Who benefits from this war  Like us, we are sure you do not want to see more people die, more children grow up orphaned, more families torn apart. We urge you to be on the side of friendship between nations.

Owned by Russian billionaire Viktor Vekselberg, the vessel aposTangoapos was seized today at a shipyard in Palma, Mallorca, Spain, along with ious computer devices and documents.

Last month, following the invasion of Ukraine, he was hit with further sanctions by the US, the UK, the EU and Australia.He was also questioned by special counsel Robert Mueller during his investigation into Russian interference in the  US election. He reportedly lives in Switzerland.  In a statement, Spain’s Guardia Civil said they took the ft ship in a joint operation with the FBI and the US Department of Homeland Security.

The Tango sails under a Cook Islands flag and is registered to a company based in the British Virgin Islands, which is in turn managed by Panamanian companies. The Guardia Civil described this setup as “a complex financial and corporate plot to hide the true real ownership”.The force further described Vekselberg as “a person very close to Vladimir Putin” and said he was under investigation in the US for “tax fraud, money laundering and  documentation”.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Vladimir PutinGuardia CivilBillionairesRussiaRussia Ukraine war\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

It comes as mounting evidence of war crimes committed by Russian forces in the city near capital Kyiv will be discussed by a United Nations Security Council today. The Ukrainian President - who was seen holding back tears as he visited the aftermath on Monday - will address the council, which is pushing to ensure justice is done. Volodymyr Zelensky surveyed the alleged atrocities near capital Kyiv, describing the discovery of raped women and murdered children among the dead. He was accompanied by defending servicemen after invading troops had retreated from the area. US President Joe Biden called for Kremlin leader Vladimir Putin to face a war crimes trial, adding he is now seeking further sanctions against Russia. This guy is brutal and whataposs happening in Bucha is outrageous and everyoneaposs seen it, he said in an impassioned speech last night.  Ukrainian officials have vowed to hunt down the butchers of Bucha after hundreds of dead civilians were discovered. Kyiv intelligence sources have named Lt Colonel Azatbek Omurbekov - who leads the th Separate Motorised Rle Brigade which occupied the region - as the commander in the area. Growing evidence points to barbarism in Bucha with local women and children raped and shot and demands are growing for accountability over atrocities by Vladimir Putinaposs forces. Zelensky has warned that worse evidence of mass killings of civilians by Moscow will emerge as the Russian president repositions his troops to the south-east.  It will be his first address to the Security Council, whose presidency is held by the UK, with members including Russia and China. The Ukrainian leader accused Moscow of committing real genocide, as he appeared visibly emotional, flanked by his soldiers and wearing a bullet-proof vest. Ihor Zhovkva, deputy head of the office of the President of Ukraine, said Mr Zelensky will give all the evidence to the international community at the Security Council meeting. If these awful atrocities will not change the agenda of all the world, what will change  the adviser asked on BBC Radio aposs Today programme. Mr Zhovkva said Ukraine needs additional weapons, including tanks and missiles, to liberate more cities from Russia control. Dame Barbara Woodward, Britainaposs UN ambassador, called images coming from Bucha harrowing, appalling, probable evidence of war crimes and possibly a genocide. She cited hundreds of bodies being dumped in the streets or in mass graves and allegations of rape. Ukrainian reporter Evgeny Spirin said: “Some of the killed children had their arms tied up. Children…. They were tying up children. There were shot dogs.  He added: “Irpen, Bucha, Dmitrievka. How to live with this, and is it worth living at all  How do I explain this to myself, how  “They must cease to exist. They must all be destroyed, each and every one of them, turned into dust, into mud, into clay, all of them.”Ukrainian activists and web sleuths have identied the presence of Omurbekov’s forces - which are normally based in the far east of Russia - and a number of other Russian military units. Volunteers group Tretya Sila reported: In Bucha there was a military unit  from the village of Knyaze-Volkonskoye, Khabarovsk region... “Soon all these murderers, rapists and looters will be known by name. InformNapalm volunteers named Omurbekov as unit  of the th Separate Motorized Rle Brigade amid suspicions of grotesque war crimes in Bucha. In the city, too, according to the Ukrainians, were forces from the Fth Separate Guards Tank Brigade of th army of the Russian Eastern military district, the st Parachute Assault Regiment of th airborne ision, the th Parachute Assault Regiment of th airborne ision, the th and th Air Assault Regiments of the th Guards Air Assault Division,  and  separate guard brigades of special purpose the rd special operational regiments of the Russian national guard, and the th separate guards brigade of marines of the Pacic Fleet.  So far no commanders have been named from these forces apart from Omurbekov. Russian sources have hit back claiming the Ukrainians were responsible for the atrocities in Bucha and other locations - and are the ones guilty of war crimes. Russian ambassador to the US Anatoly Antonov said: “The Russian defence ministry has fully rejected these  accusations.” He said: ”I would like to point out that Russian troops left Bucha on March . “The Ukrainian authorities remained silent all these days, and now they have suddenly posted sensational footage in order to tarnish Russia’s image and make Russia defend itself.  I would like to emphasise with full responsibility that not a single civilian suffered from violence when the town was controlled by the Russian Armed Forces.ed Forces. On the contrary, our troops delivered  tonnes of humanitarian aid for civilians. Meanwhile, the fact that the Ukrainian Armed Forces shelled the town of Bucha right after Russian troops had left was deliberately ignored in the US. “This is what could have caused civilian casualties. That said, the Kiev regime is clearly trying to blame its atrocities on Russia.” Konstantin Kosachev, deputy speaker of the Russian upper house of parliament, said: “There are no doubts that it is a staging organised by Kyiv authorities. “And the fact that the West has picked it up and is hyping it makes it an accomplice of this cynical and immoral crime.”  Foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova claimed Kyiv colluded with the West in seeking to blame Russia. I think that the very fact that these statements were made minutes after these materials were released leaves no doubts as for who has contracted this story, she told state-run Rossiya- television channel. The West decided immediately Russia was to blame “based on the videos, seconds-long videos and several photos. “And they are ready to pour accusations. “No expert work done, no information from the other side throwing light on what is going on... She claimed the massacres were a provocation staged by the Ukrainian military and radical nationalists” to disrupt peace talks. Also today, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss will hold talks with her Polish counterpart, Zbigniew Rau, during the second day of her visit to the capital, Warsaw. She has called for Russia to be hit with the maximum level of sanctions and for more weapons to be supplied to Mr Zelenskyaposs forces to help repel the Kremlinaposs troops. The idea that we should wait for something  bad to happen is just completely wrong, she said, applying pressure to allies. The reality is that money is still flowing from the West into Putinaposs war machine - and that has to stop. She pressed for a clear timetable to eliminate imports of Russian oil, gas and gold, and for a further crackdown on industries financing Moscowaposs invasion. Polandaposs prime minister Mateusz Morawiecki has criticised German Chancellor Olaf Scholz for focusing on the voices of German businesses rather than the innocents slain in Ukraine. Prime Minister Boris Johnson is likely to urge Germany to set a date for phasing out Russian gas when he meets Mr Scholz in Downing Street on Friday.

Much of the chamber music that Mozart composed was music for friends to perform and this trio is just one of these.Originally composed for clarinet, viola and piano, the viola part can be performed on cello as Harriet ably demonstrated. Very typically Mozart # easy to listen to and thoroughly enjoyable.On to the Craftsbury Trio, written by the American Gwyneth Walker. This trio has four movements, each depicting the small town of Craftsbury, Vermont.Up Country Toccata, The Lark in the Morning, You Can Buy It at the General Store, to the final movement Craftsbury Common depicting the green with a white picket fence.The movements are as descriptive as their titles and show many dferent skills on all instruments # fluttering sounds, jazz harmonies, numerous glissandos, syncopation, decorations and finishing with gentle rhythmic tapping.There is even a hint of Rhapsody in Blue in the third movement. If you only listen to one piece again this is the one and should be seen live,possible, and not just listened to.Rachmaninov’s Prelude in B minor for solo piano was Claire’s choice for the programme.This prelude, The Bell was Rachmaninov’s own favourite and was the one that he would often perform. The audience was delighted to be introduced to it by Claire.Brahms composed four chamber works which featured the clarinet later in le after a period when he wasn’t writing anything at all.This was the third trio of the evening and was again very dferent in style allowing Jenner , Harrietand Claireto demonstrate their considerable skills as a trio to a very appreciative audience.An arrangement of Consolation No. by Liszt for Trio Ecossaise was their encore.This was the second visit by Trio, and it is only a matter of time before they are welcomed back.There are two MAAA concerts planned for April # The Willow Trioand the Ugly Bug Ragtime Three.

What we are hoping to do is turn some of what nature dealt us into a positive.#We would like to hear from woodland owners who think they may have a suitable ash that we could use to promote the hardwood sector.#Scottish Forestry’s forest industries advisor Ros Wardman added: #As part of the project all the stages from finding the tree, to processing, milling, drying, selecting makers, and creating the furniture, will be fully documented. It’s a great way to showcase Scottish workmanship at its finest.#A strong element of the show will be to educate the public about ash dieback and other tree diseases affecting the hardwood sector.#If we can find a grand tree, it would be a fitting and productive end to a tree that was brought down prematurely by the storms, or about to felled because of the disease.#Woodland owners who think they may have a large ash or ash strands affected by the storms should contact the Scottish Furniture Makers Association on info@scottishfurnituremakers.org.uk"},{"url":null,"title":"news from the districts june 18 2021 2 2 2 2 2 4 4 2 2 2 2","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Fyne Ales has struck gold in a prestigious industry awards scheme.One of the Cairndow-based brewery#s best-selling products, Hurricane Jack, won gold at this year’s national SIBAIndependent Beer Awards.The fruity blonde ale advanced to the national finals after topping the Scottish cask heats in , seeing off stf competition to be named the UK’s best cask bitter up to . per cent.Hurricane Jack is brewed using US Amarillo and Cascade hops.

Baby young cod are not caught in prawn creels. The scientists at the Rural Affairs Committee meeting on March  said that there was zero evidence for creels to be included in the ban, and that the previous evidence cited on the Scottish Government website had now been removed.Our MSP represented to the creel fishermen in Campbeltown that she would:.    Seek a relaxation of the ban to enable the creel fishermen to continue to work as per the scientic evidence advice..    Seek compensation for the creel fishermen for almost three months loss of income.However, in the event she VOTED.    To keep the ban in place.    Against compensation.This is absolutely duplicitous.

If you look at a sunflower, you can’t help but smile. Not only does it remind us of the sun, but its head will track the sun through the sky and wherever the light is a sunflower will find it.Snapdragons are great because they come in a iety of colours and sizes, and you can pinch the blossoms so they open and shut just like a dragon’s mouth.Snapdragon flowers are specically designed for bumblebees, which are just the right weight to trip the opening mechanism of the lower lip of the flower to gain access to the nectar.The four o’clock flower, also known as the marvel of Peru, is a bushy plant with trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of pink, yellow or white.The fragrant flowers don’t open until late afternoon, around four o’clock – so they are good for telling the time.If you are growing your own vegetables, now is a good time to start sowing tomatoes, so you can enjoy them throughout the summer.To grow tomatoes successfully, you need rich, fertile soil or peat-free potting compost, and a good sunny, sheltered spot.Water regularly and feed regularly once the plants start to flower.Tomatoes are split into two main growing types – bush and cordon.Bush types are usually planted in containers and their stems trail around the edge. Cordon types are trained to grow tall and are supported by a cane or stake and will require pinching out.Growing tomatoes from seed is best done under cover, into seed trays, then when the seedlings get to -cm tall, transplant to small cm pots. Keep potting on as they grow in size.They can be planted outside with cane supports once the last frosts have gone, so around May time.For best results, choose trusted ieties like Gardener#s Delight, Money Maker or Sweet Olive.As usual, April really kick-starts the gardening season.As the Royal Horticultural Society says, spring is finally in evidence as daffodils and flowering trees start to bloom.#Expect the inevitable April showers this month but with sunny days too, when you can turn your attention to the lawn,# said a spokesperson.#It#s an exciting month, with indoor-sown seeds well into growth, and it#s also time to start sowing outdoors.

It’s a hormone which helps build trust and attachment, as opposed to cortisol, which increases stress levels.We do sometimes need cortisol when faced with a challenge or fearful situation, so it does have its . It’s part of our fight and flight response. But the problem arises when levels remain too high for an extended period of time, as this keeps our bodies under a constant state of stress.When this happens, it can cause anxiety and depression, but also lots of physical issues such as headaches and tummy pain. It’s very dficult to concentrate and remember things when we are in this state.The study showed that for children in hospital, a time full of stress and worry for many reasons, storytelling resulted in an increase in oxytocin levels and reduction of cortisol, and so made the children feel less anxious and stressed, and even helped ease their physical pain.While the context of this research was children in the very stressful situation of being in hospital, I think the results and conclusions are also relevant for children in other stressful settings, including at school and home. I’m not making a direct comparison, but we’ve not had ‘normal times’ recently, and even in usual times, high levels of stress can be a big issue for many. So levels of stress and anxiety are heightened, even beyond the ‘normal’ for many of us.Some of the language in the article is related to the science of the findings, but the conclusions and observations are things teachers, parents and storytellers of all kinds will recognise. It describes how children being told the story “are transported to another possible world during storytelling sessions” and can “elicit positive physiological and psychological changes”. In other words, it can have a positive effect on physical and mental health.This transportation to “another possible world” is what storytellers often refer to as the story trance. It’s when children are absorbed in a story, and taken by their imagination to the world the story creates. The report explains that this absorption stimulates ious parts of the brain and aids the listener’s development of empathy, as well as a better understanding of their own emotions.None of this is really surprising, of course. But it’s really useful to have this kind of scientic back-up. An important finding was that the stories told were ones widely available and not specically adapted for therapeutic use just the kind of tales you find in a book from the library.And while they used professional storytellers for the research, a key point was that everyone can have this impact, including parents and caregivers: “It is important to note that even though we have used experienced storytellers for our research purposes, we believe that parents should be encouraged to tell their children stories. As we have shown, it is not necessary to use special stories or books or even specic techniques to achieve a successful outcome. Storytelling can be an effective means of creating important emotional bonds.”As I have said, this study looked at the impact of storytelling for children in hospital, which can be a deeply distressing time for both child and parents.Reading the report made me remember the time I was seven years old in the Western General Hospital, in an isolation ward by myself, very ill. I was told a story about a dragon who lived in a castle, and was given a model castle, made from used toilet rolls, and painted silver. I’d look at it when I was alone, which I always was except for visits. It was a stage for my imagination. I’d speak to the dragon and imagine the adventures I’d have with him when I finally got out of hospital. These stories were always my secret, but they helped me get out of hospital and have fun, when in the real world I could do neither.The thing is, our kids, as well ourselves, need this. The story is part of it, the characters, the challenges, the suspense, the connection to the emotions in the tale. It all works on our brain and our being. But it’s also the process of storytelling: the togetherness it creates, the shared space and attention, the heart-to-heart connection, the stimulation of imagination. Not even the best film on a screen does that.We are all storytellers, but sometimes it is good to be reminded just how important it is to be so, and that includes listening to, as well as telling, stories.As the report concluded: “Stories possess a symbolic dimension that seems to create a natural bridge to the core of our humanity.”"},{"url":null,"title":"leading-pig-farmers-plea-cabinet-secretary","story":"Mairi Gougeon MSP was accompanied by county MSP Paul McLennan on the visit to one of several high-health pig farms run by Mr Wyllie.Pig farms across Scotland are all operating at a substantial and growing loss.Mr Wyllie, of Ruchlaw Mains, Stenton, estimates that losses of about £ per pig in February last year have since deepened to more than £ per pig. Overdrafts are rising at an alarming rate and several Scottish farmers have already sold off sows to cut losses.The pig sector encountered signicant disruption during the Covid- pandemic which affected processing capacity and saw the partial closure of Scotland’s largest pig abattoir facility at Brechin.Much to the disappointment of NFU Scotland, several major retailers have continued to stock signicant volumes of imported pork, undermining, the union says, home production.And the dramatic spike in animal feed prices in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine has also signicantly increased the scale of current losses on pig farms.It is in the interests of Scottish consumers, processors, and retailers, adds the union, that farmgate prices for pigs rise immediately to stave off a rapid rate of herd liquidations.Speaking on behalf of NFU Scotland, Mr Wyllie thanked the Cabinet Secretary for the pig hardship scheme in Scotland, established following the Covid-driven closure of the Brechin abattoir, but called on her to consider further immediate, direct support for the sector to ensure a critical mass of production was preserved.He also asked for the Scottish Government to consider an ‘Ongoers’ loan scheme to help financially support those who saw their future in the industry.NFU Scotland called on the Scottish Government to seek greater retailer support for Scottish pork, highlighting that a small percentage increase in the volume of home-produced pork on supermarket shelves would make a considerable dference.Help in re-establishing the Chinese export licence at Brechin, lost because of the Covid outbreak at the plant, would also expand the market opportunities for Scottish pig producers.At a UK level, NFU Scotland called for the Scottish Government to push Westminster on the need for “proper border controls” to monitor pork imports and for the English language requirements for overseas butchers looking to come to the UK to work in the staff-strapped processing sector to be relaxed."},{"url":null,"title":"six-county-schools-come-together-climate-change-event","story":"Teams of  pupils had to produce a plan for a product or initiative and an accompanying poster and presentation, which was made to a judging .Belhaven Hill School hosted the event, which was attended by pupils from Gordonstoun Junior School, Strathallan Prep School, Ardvreck, Fettes Prep and Cargilfield, earlier this month.The categories for the climate change event were defined by the annual Earthshot Prize, with each team choosing from: the restoration and protection of nature air cleanliness ocean revival waste-free living and climate action.Olly Langton, Belhaven Hill headmaster, said: “We want to ensure our pupils know that they can have a signicant impact on their environment now and in the future.“So my we Rosie and I came up with the idea of developing a Community of Prep and Primary Schoolsin Scotland to energise the children and bring them together to form an alliance to protect the things they love.“We were also keen to involve members of the local Dunbar community, where there is a strong environmental ethos which encourages collaboration.”The teams presented to a  of judges from the sustainability sector: Jonathan Hodges, senior innovation engineer at Wave Energy Scotland Duncan Lang, senior environment specialist at the Asian Development Bank and Izzy Heard, technical officer for the Climate Disclosure Project.The lists introduced themselves before watching each -minute presentation and giving immediate feedback.The teams completed a number of environmentally themed talks and activities, while Surfers Against Sewage encouraged youngsters to ‘Think Global Act Local’.“It was a pleasure to hear the great ideas and passionate presentations from this next generation of climate-aware thinkers,” said Mr Hodges.“The projects started by these students have already created positive change in their schools and communities, and I have no doubt they will follow-up with more.”In the afternoon, pupils took part in the Scottish Prep Schools Debating Championship – the motion challenged the children to consider whether short-haul flights should be banned.Edinburgh’s Cargilfield triumphed in both competitive elements of the day.The prize for outstanding inidual award on the day went to a pupil from Ardvreck, who went away with a voucher for a surfing lesson at Belhaven Bay, thanks to the generosity of CoastCoast.The next day, the bay was also the location for the first ForthSHORE beach clean by pupils from Belhaven with GreenTweed Eco.All the children took away a bird box, thanks to the East Lothian Primary Schools Bird Box Project, sponsored by ArdMoor, and a certicate.The next stage of the venture is for all of the schools to take part in a joint fundraising venture in the summer term.

Poverty is very much still with us, even within our most well-off communities. East Lothian Council has an updated poverty strategy and the local area partnerships have had specic funding to tackle poverty and inequalities.The pandemic, Brexit and the war in Ukrainehave all added to the pressures on prices of le’s basics, from food to transport and utilities. A rural area like ours has many who rely on heating oil, which is now about £ a litre. Many in the villages have no public transport and need to run a car.I attend the East Lothian Friendly Food Network – a council-supported network of those involved in food from across the county. Many of those who attend are from the county’s foodbanks and community pantries.The Scottish Government recently ran a consultation on how the need for foodbanks may be ended. However, all facilities in East Lothian report growing calls for support.Those needing help include, as well as those on benefits, increasing numbers of those on low pay who find that the cost of basics is a growing proportion of their weekly income.There have been mounting calls for food that does not need cooking. There are increasing requests for help to pay for gas and electricity. The charges to those on prepaid meters are higher and the top-ups on a card last for much less time than before.One organisation has been giving hot water bottles as it’s cheaper to boil a kettle to fill a bottle than turn the heating on. Organisations across the county are arranging free community meals. Breakfast club provision for children is expanding to ensure children do not go to school hungry.I recently attended a national conference where the cost of living crisis was debated. The experience identied in East Lothian is replicated across the UK.The Chancellor’s Spring Statement could have given much more help than it did. Benefits and state pension remain lagging behind the rate of inflation and could have been increased VAT could have been reduced on fuel for heating, lighting and cooking the uplt in Universal Credit could have been restored the increase in National Insurance waived. Sadly, those with the least income are those who lost out and will continue to see the cost of living eating into their weekly money pot.In the meantime, residents can continue to support the many excellent local organisations offering support, whether as donations of food, money or volunteering time. They remain a vital leline for some of the most vulnerable in all our communities.Jacquie Bell Belhaven"},{"url":null,"title":"reveals-north-berwick-one-uks-best-seaside-towns","story":"The town received an overall rating of %.The list was compiled by reviews from more than , visitors who gave feedback on their recent trips to seaside towns, villages and resorts.Destinations were rated on their beaches, attractions, value for money, peace and quiet, and scenery.North Berwick scored the following for these categories:Beach:  Attractions:  Value for money:  Peace and quiet:  Scenery:  On Tripadvisor, visitors to North Berwick praise the town for its day trips, excursions and sights to see.

We’ve begun to understand the concept of neuro-ersity – thinking in a dferent way – and realise those considered to be autistic can often be viewing le through a fascinating, imaginative lens.But could we have imagined a young autistic Scot not only going on to become a professional actor but landing two major roles – almost as he walked out of the gates of drama college Connor Curren, who grew up in the north Glasgow suburb of Lenzie, has proven all bets are off when it comes to assessing the potential of the neuroerse. Not only has he been appearing in major CBBC drama Dodger alongside Christopher Eccleston, but the young actor is also currently touring the UK in The Curious Incident of the Dog in The Night-time.The stage play sees Curren cast as Christopher Boone, a -year-old who finds a dead dog in his garden and sets off to investigate. We go on a journey inside this young man’s head, a head fixated by numbers, angles, captured by lights, always working out possibilities, yet the journey of just a few streets takes him far from his comfort zone.Based on the bestselling novel by Mark Haddon, Christopher is reckoned to be autisticThis minor superhero role is an incredible part to play, but now the National Theatre has made the decision to cast a neuroerse actor.Does Curren appreciate that  years ago this form of positive casting wouldn’t have taken place. “If I were this age  years ago, I probably wouldn’t have known this about myself,” he admits, speaking from Liverpool where he’s appearing. “It’s a part of myself I would have been yet to discover. And I would guess my le would have gone in a very dferent direction. Or I would have been a very dferent person in so many ways.”Developments in understanding the brains of neuroerse people have allowed us to understand more of how they process information they can have dficulty in organising tasks – yet also possess the ability to approach things more creatively.Curren however suggests that the acting world is already complimented by many neuroerse people. “I think it’s an abundant world, considering the likes of ADHT, dyslexia and Asperger’s. I think this profession attracts people from across the neuroerse spectrum.”Those who think dferently are attracted to a world which encourages it  “Yes, I think so. People who have perhaps more of a need for self-expression. And that can lead to creative pursuits.“And speaking as an autistic person, I think passion and obsession are key traits in acting.” He grins: “It’s a job in which you e headfirst into the deep end.”Yet, in the past, some considered those deemed to be autistic to be lacking in empathy. If this were the case, it’s not a great trait to have in a profession in which the principal purpose is to portray emotion  “I’ve said to many people over the years that having been raised in a neurotypical society I’ve been neurotypical in my head. So, I’ve been acting this way,you will, for most of my le. So, I feel I can do it.“But in terms of the empathy thing, I would say I am an empathetic person, or at least I believe I am. In fact, sometimes there are people in the autistic spectrum who feel they have too much empathy, and sometime emotions can overcome them.“I feel this is something to be considered, rather than the viewpoint of the antiquated society which says we lack empathy. Really, what itoften boils down to is a lack of ability to interpret social cues, and this can be misconstrued.”He adds, smiling: “I’m not a scientist, but I don’t think I have any empathy problems at all.”And acting is, well, acting. You don’t need to have the mechanical mindset of a sociopath in order to play a murderer. “Exactly,” he says.Curren is supportive of the trend for actors to have lived the experience of the characters they are playing. but acknowledges that acting is “all about imagination, to be able to escape into a fantasy world. It’s like being a child, a cowboy or whatever.”But he adds “In the past, you would assume this [acting] to be an extrovert’s game. And a neuroergent would be more academic. But not now.”Connor Curren wasn’t, however, a performing child ready to act from the moment he left the womb. When he walked out of Lenzie Academy aged  “high school wasn’t my forte” with one Higher in Photography his future wasn’t clear at all.“I flirted with acting, did supporting acting work in Waterloo Road,” he recalls. Having already taken acting classes at Glasgow Acting Academy to help build confidencehe studied drama at New College in Lanarkshire.He was then accepted by Birmingham Conservatoire. “Some people may fancy being an actor but then you get into the nitty gritty and that’s when I knew I loved it.”But where are we with neuroersity nowadays  Should we be having this conversation  Do we over-examine young people these days in terms of their personality traits and dferences “Analysing the mind is a great thing,” he suggests. “But so long as we don’t go at it from the angle that we assume there is something wrong with the neuroerse mind. That’s what we’ve been doing for decades. We’ve been looking at it as something that is wrong, less than, or defective. And we’ve got to avoid preconceptions we have of people who are autistic. For example, Christopher is a character who’s seen to be very good at maths, and I’m not. At all.” He laughs. “I’m not playing myself.”Curren was diagnosed aged seven. Did this discovery help make le a little easier  “I suppose it did because you learn more of yourself when you are young.”Were his traits of autism easily discernible  “I don’t want to go too much into my childhood, but there were obsessive repetitive behaviours, attachment to certain objects. Those were the main signs.”Thankfully, public figures such as Melanie Sykes, who was diagnosed recently with autism, help push the stigma down. “Yes, there will come a time when it won’t be seen as a criticism. Some communities, sadly, still view autism as being defective, something that has to be cured, rather than celebrated.”What’s extremely likely is that Connor Curren will become a role model for the autistic community. And he has spoken to groups of young people who are neuroerse, keen to put something back.For the moment however his ambitions are closer to home. “It will be so great to go back to Glasgow, to have my grandparents come and see me in the theatre. They haven’t been able to see me perform since Covid arrived.”He adds: “And I get to sleep in my old bed.”The Curious Incident of the Dog in The Night-time.

There is something about this trio that makes you feel they should be driving a camper van and have a dog called Scooby Doo. Whatever: after years of slight awkwardness they have gelled nicely.The first of nine regional visits was to the Highlands. The one-bedroom Lorne Cottage in Fort William is possibly the smallest home there has been in the competition. Homeowners Ciara and Arran were fans of the show and had plans to enter one day when they had their “big house”. Opportunity had knocked now, however, much to their delight.: A sneak peek inside cutest propertyThere had already been one casualty in their battle to have a magazine standard home complete with mustard-coloured velour sofa. “We no longer let our wee dog Ghost on the bed or couch since moving here,” confessed Ciara. Across Scotland, smirking dog lovers placed bets on how long that would last.With Lorne Cottage cheered to the rafters for its “cute as a button” look it was on to The Tower, a church conversion in the Black Isle dating from the s and modernised in the s. This was home to Rachel, Rob and dog Tia, who was allowed on the couch.Rachel had wanted to downsize to a small fishing village, but ended up with a gaff that could host a medium-sized royal wedding. Stunning, but you had to wonder, with a shiver, what it cost to heat.It was the perfect location for Anna to start throwing round terms such as mis en place and Escher-like staircase . You don’t get many of those on Changing Rooms.The final stop was Loch Lann House, an th century dovecote folly in Culloden that had Michael reminiscing about the good old days when you could buy a piece of land and build what you wanted on it.Fortunately, this was a charming pile, hoaching with character as we say in the west. Home to Rory, Eilidh and the youngest of their six children, Loch Lann had Anna’s favourite thing, a hanging chair, which she rushed to try. Then again, the house had pretty much everything crammed into it, including a golden bath from Paris, so the chances of a hanging chair were good.Michael said the place called to mind a George Bernard Show quote: “Some people see the world and ask why, and there are others that dream of things that never were and say why not ” Personally, I was thinking “nightmare to clean” but each to their own.: SHOTY judge on Skyes charmsThe winner, Lorne Cottage, should answer some of the criticism levelled at previous series: that SHOTY is all about fancy homes and expensive, designer-led style, what you might call a faux fur throw and nae knickers approach to home decoration. But Lorne Cottage won largely because the judges took to its vibe straight away. Who hasn’t done that when falling for a home On to the final, then, for Ciara, Arran, and Ghost. We wish all well especially the bright yellow sofa.

People are also being advised to take a test prior to visiting someone who is vulnerable.If you develop symptoms, you should continue to get a PCR test.On vaccination, the First Minister said: “The advice to everyone, of course, remains as important as ever – please do take the opportunity to get vaccinated as soon as you are able and make sure you get all doses of vaccine that you are eligible for.

We did not expect the extremely positive and proactive response we received from the jobcentre. The team was very helpful,# said Jordan.The support Elite got from the jobcentre was invaluable in streamlining and accelerating its recruitment process which would take up to five weeks.#Now, the jobcentre advertises our vacancies via a sector-based work academy.#Candidates attend a two-week course at Weston College, Yeovil, to gain their Scaffolding Operative Training Scheme and Health  Safety Certications, as well as to prepare for an interview. Now when we interview candidates, they already have a scaffold labourer trainee card and the basic knowledge and understanding of the scaffolding industry. What’s more, all this support via the jobcentre comes without the additional fees of private agencies.#Out of seven candidates, six were offered jobs and five have remained with Elite which has  qualied operatives.#The process was seamless and effective, providing quality candidates who were keen to learn.#Working with the jobcentre is a no brainer! As well as alleviating the burden of interviews that don’t progress into jobs, the savings in cost and time to get candidates suitably qualied are a bonus. It takes the pressure off our own resources and provides top quality candidates in the process.#‘Delighted’: Simon, Employer Adviser, Yeovil JobCentreOnce approached by Elite Scaffolding, also based in Yeovil, he set up a meeting with one of its office managers and worked out a bespoke recruitment package.As part of the programme, he contacted the local Weston College and together they “built” the course content.At the end of the two-week course, six candidates were offered a place on the apprenticeship scheme at a starting salary of £,.#Elite had exhausted all other channels to recruit and were delighted with the outcome#, he said.Moreover Elite referred other local employers to the jobcentre and Simon is running another sector-based work academy with a local roofing company.#The jobcentre has an incredible pool of talent.

Everything went through really quickly.#Continued the  year-old: “My team at JD were great from day one. They made me feel welcome and supported me. I spent six months on the placement and I got paid, too. It’s a proper job which was exactly what I needed. Day to day, I’d look after anything from HR queries and issuing contracts to payroll and pension questions. It gave me a whole picture of what it’s like to work in HR and I’ve been doing it ever since.“After six months, there was the option to stay on and I’m now doing an apprenticeship with JD. Once I’d finished with the placement I got started on a qualication – CIPD level three in HR support. It was another perfect step for me and I’ve now been there for a year.

But six wins from eight outings since has thrust Antonio Conte’s men into pole position for fourth. While they have played a game more than Arsenal, next month’s rescheduled north London derby means Spurs are effectively in control of their own destiny.

Ajax boss Erik Ten Hag and Paris St Germain’s Mauricio Pochettino remain the front-runners.

The identity of a person could undoubtedly be forged by the place of their birth and the community of that place, particularly at a time in the past when populations were less mobile.The traits of a person’s parents manest in their physical appearance their spirit, likes and dislikes, and sometimes even interests or inclinations might appear hereditary – not just from mother and father but perhaps from an ancestor remembered only by name and special characteristic, like poesy or craft skill..The failure by clan chiefs and other landed gentry to recognise this customary right held by the people since time immemorial underpins the Clearances, while demands for its recognition echo through much of the collective action undertaken against this violence, trauma, and dispossession. as far back in history as I can.The world and society these people lived in was so dferent to ours today, making context crucial to understanding the words being used and the philosophy from which they derive.Aside from the multitude which are in still in use today, there are published proverb collections as well as countless sound recordings, many digitized and made easily accessible by Tobar an Dualchais.By their nature proverbs cut across boundaries of class and gender, their survival relying upon oral transmission, on being commonly known in a community and thus reflecting its values.

The strength of attachment to people and place shines through both.Blood is stronger than breeding., ‘blood is thicker than water’, and perhaps it should come as no surprise to us that a society which places strong emphasis on ancestry and blood ties should have so many proverbs reinforcing such beliefs..Sad is the inheritance of a bad disease.This proverb is the perfect reminder that not everything we inherit from our ancestors is good.

Despite their benevolent roots, the modern pressures facing the sector, they say, simply make it too dficult to keep their Portree home open.The building needs too much work and they don’t have the money to pay for it.The only option, families were told, is closure – with the suggestion that the  residents could all be accommodated nearby in a refurbished and expanded Home Farm.It is not dficult to understand why families are so aggrieved at this proposal.Things may well have improved at Home Farm since the horrors of Covid, but have all the lessons been learned The blanket national policy of shting patients from hospitals to care homes in the frantic weeks of early  was a huge factor in the devastating Covid death toll that followed.Yet now, with the pandemic still not behind us, families in Skye are being told they should accept the transfer en masse of their elderly relatives to the very home so ravaged by coronavirus when it was proven to be over capacity and understaffed.At Budhmor, they managed to keep the home safe from the worst of Covid-. Relatives of residents will tell you that was no fluke – but down to good standards, diligent management and conscientious staff.There will be some truth in the financial and staffing pressures that CrossReach cite in their reasons for closure. But two years on from the outset of Covid, should the sector not be doing all it can to preserve and build on the success of an institution which proved such a good example during the pandemic, rather than bowing to the bottom line and accepting its loss.There is also the matter of an options appraisal on health and care needs in the north of Skye, currently being prepared by NHS Highland.Closure must at the very least be halted until this review is complete – andthis requires support for CrossReach, our Government should find it.In the longer term what we really need are alternative models to those that are currently governed by economies of scale than on inidual or community needs. An agenda of rationalisation and centralisation has taken hold of far too many of our public services and is ultimately driving decisions like the closure of small care facilities offering a homely, personalised environment in favour of a vast, but possibly distant one many miles from an inidual’s home community.No-where has this been more obvious, or dangerous, than in the west Highland health and care sector.We should start the fightback by backing Budhmor care home, and keeping it open."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1649069162491.jpg--housing_provider_choice_and_trussell_trust_support_ni_families_in_need.jpg?1649069171000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20220404newshousing provider choice and trussell trust support ni families in need","story":"Local housing association, Choice Housing has partnered with the Trussell Trust to provide food parcels to families in need across Northern Ireland. With the signicant rise in the cost of living, particularly the continued increase in gas and electricity prices, many are struggling to provide the basics of food and heat. Recent research indicated that one in every four children in Northern Ireland are living in a family which is struggling to provide basic requirements of heat, food, clothing, and childcare. Under these pressures many families are at risk of getting into further debt and are heavily reliant on food banks to supplement their financial situation. Carol Ervine, Choice Group Director of Tenant and Client Services said,“As an organisation we are committed to providing more than bricks and mortar and realise that whilst having a home is a human right, there are many who are living with the real threat of poverty and financial instability. With the cost of living continuing to rise, the cost of the weekly shop has become signicantly higher, and many families are making the decision between heating or eating. Working with the Trussell Trust, we are able to provide much needed food parcels to families in need, with the knowledge that this will ease at least part of the burden. The Trussell Trust support a UK network of food banks providing emergency food and support to people in poverty whilst campaigning for change to end the need for food banks in the UK. The Trust recently outlined that in the year  , .m food bank parcels were given to people in crisis in the past year across the UK with close to , emergency food parcels distributed across Northern Ireland in the same period. Jonny Currie, Northern Ireland Network Lead from the Trussell Trust said,“We welcome this partnership with Choice Housing providing vital support to our network of food banks in Northern Ireland. Food banks and their volunteers are extraordinary, and their response to need in their communities is inspiring. But that kind of response shouldn’t be needed. In the last year in Northern Ireland almost , emergency food parcels were provided by food banks in the Trussell Trust’s network – and more than , of these were for children. It’s not right that some of us cannot afford our own food.That’s why we are working towards a just, compassionate future, where no one should have to use a food bank to get by. Choice also manage a Financial Inclusion programme, through which they are supporting tenants to improve their money management, ensuring they can maximise their income. In the last year this programme helped tenants access pound. million in financial gains, and specialised staff at Choice are continuing to help tenants with benefits, debt, and budgeting advice."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_4563957.jpg--.jpg?1649147610000\n","title":"donation to air ambulance ni in nan s memory","story":" The family of the late Nan Crawford, Parkmore, Ballymena, who passed away peacefully on the th December  have made a donation to the Air Ambulance NI Charity in her memory.Nan’s husband Rodger and daughter-in-law Catherine made the donation of pound to Air Ambulance NI as it was Nan’s wish to have donations in-lieu of flowers to the helicopter emergency medical service before she passed away.

Pic: Liam McBurney PA WireNiamh CampbellTwitterEmailApril   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailThe DUP’s new party election broadcast has received a mixed reaction, with many on social media criticising Sir Jeffrey Donaldson’s focus on Sinn Fein.The clip, which last for two minutes and  seconds, shows the DUP leader walking up a mountain outside the Mournes to watch the sunrise with some of his party colleagues, including East Belfast assembly candidate Joanne Bunting and Diane Forsythe, the mum-of-three who replaced veteran MLA Jim Wells as the South Down assembly candidate. Notably, one person who is not featured is Edwin Poots, who replaced Christopher Stalford as the party’s MLA in South Belfast following his sudden death. Mr Poots is now standing for the DUP in the constituency in the upcoming election.Diane Forsythe was selected over Mr Poots to be the party’s South Down nominee in what has been widely seen as a snub to the man who was, for a brief period, party leader.In the new broadcast, Mr Donaldson explains to the camera his five-point plan to “build a better future for Northern Ireland within the union”. His proposals include “fixing the NHS, helping working families, keeping our schools world-class, growing the economy, and removing the Northern Ireland Protocol”.  Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up He goes on to explain some of the measures intended to do this, which involve “creating , new jobs to keep our young people at home” and providing “ hours’ free childcare each week for parents”.“The Protocol remains a threat to our place within the United Kingdom,” Mr Donaldson continues.Sinn Fein want to win this election so they can implement their plans for a border poll, which means Northern Ireland will face months and even years of arguing and fighting, rather than fixing our health service and focusing on rebuilding and growing our economy. Now is not the time for more ision and uncertainty. Read MoreJeffrey Donaldson: Problems with Brexit the fault of other partiesSam McBride:OpinionBeating Sinn Fein will be hard, but dealing with what comes next will be harderThat is why this election is so important. Your vote will decide on whether Northern Ireland’s future is one focused on fixing our health service, tackling the cost of living crisis and replacing the Protocol, or focused on a isive border poll.The DUP is the only party that can stop Sinn Fein’s border poll plans. A first-preference vote for any party other than the DUP will ide and weaken the unionist cause and help Sinn Fein deliver their border poll plan.”The video was first shown at the DUP’s Assembly election campaign launch in a Dundonald cinema on Monday. It has since also been shared across the party’s social media accounts and has aired on Northern Ireland TV channels, such as BBC NI and UTV. One user responded to the clip on social media, writing: “You will be extremely lucky to even get remotely near achieving any of the points in your plan. You have been arrogant and ignored your faithful voters for years.”Another inidual said: “You would need to go back to Stormont to achieve this plan,” criticising former DUP First Minister Paul Givan’s resignation in February, which led to the collapse of the Executive. Multiple people accused the party broadcast of having a “keep them#uns out” mantra, with one Twitter user posting: “Just saw the DUP#s Party Election Broadcast. Gaslighting in action, with a heavy dose of keep them#uns out! They really have nothing to offer society in . Northern Ireland deserves better than reactionaries like the DUP.”Listened to their party election broadcast earlier, same old drivel SF SF SF SF and a wee bit of important stuff,” wrote another. However, some members of the public have been showing their support for the clip, with one commenting: “Will be voting DUP this election.” Great Britain first stronger with Ulster Northern Ireland... support DUP %,” said another.Ulster Unionist leader Doug Beattie has also since responded to Sir Jeffrey’s claims in the broadcast that only his party can win the forthcoming Assembly election and stop Sinn Fein calling for a chance to vote on a united Ireland.Mr Beattie said: “Given that Sinn Fein have been repeatedly calling for a border poll with no success - even going as far as predicting a United Ireland by  - I don’t buy the DUP’s analysis that a vote for them will stop Sinn Fein calling for what they have always been calling for.It’s what Sinn Fein does.

Establish who is talking to you. Is it the candidate, or simply someone who is friend of the candidate and not even a member of their party Askthe candidate is on your street andyou could talk to him or her. If not, ask for an elected representative — there will generally be a politician present.Once you get them, you are talking to someone who actually has power rather than to someone who may know less about politics than you do.. Ask bluntly: Why should I vote for you or your party  This easy question with which to start will give you a sense of the candidate’s priorities and whether they align with your own.. Ask about the issues which matter most to you — whether major political debates such as abortion, the legacy of the Troubles or climate change, or parochial concerns about being able to recycle glass or the state of your street.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Some of these issues will not be Stormont’s responsibility , butthey matter to you there’s no harm in raising them.Councillors and MPs will be out canvassing as well —you recognise one, talk to them about an issue for which they are responsible.  Read MoreSam McBride:OpinionWhen a prospective MLA knocks on your front door, you’re holding more power than them. Ask open questions which don’t reveal your own views. An unscrupulous candidate may hint that they agree with your views — or at least not spell out their ownyou tell them what you think, so keep them guessing.. Ask how they will pay for all the proposals in their manesto. If they say it will be paid for through “efficiencies” or “reducing bureaucracy”, ask them where and how much.Don’t settle for the line about their manesto being ‘fully costed’ — the candidate should know the detail and be able to explain it.You probably won’t need to be an expert in the public finances to get sense of who knows their stuff and who is bluffing.. Health is the most pressing practical issue facing the next Executive and impacts every voter. Expert reports have repeatedly called for the creation of centres of expertise for dferent conditions, but that will mean closing or downgrading some smaller hospitals which is unpopular.Whatever your view of this, ask the candidate to be explicit about what they would support.A politician who honestly tells you something you don’t want to hear is to be respected above someone whose honeyed words don’t reveal how they would use the power which they are asking you to give them.. The MLAs elected in this election will be the first to vote on the application of the NI Protocol in  .Whatever your view on this, ask the candidate on your doorstep how they will vote on the issue in .. If, like many people, you have a low opinion of how the Stormont system has performed over recent years, you can politely but firmly make this clear. If the person on your doorstep is an outgoing MLA, you could ask them what they most regret doing, or whether they accept that their party has played any part in the current mess.The answers will give you a sense of whether the candidate is capable of self-reflection, or just spews forth party propaganda which blames everything on his or her opponents.. Pay attention to the parties you don’t support. This is a proportional representation election, meaning that you can rank the candidates in order of your preference.Many people still fail to vote beyond their preferred party, meaning they have less say in who gets in.There are five MLAs to be elected in each constituency and it makes sense to vote for as many parties as possible.In the lower end of the ballot paper, it can help to think about it as voting against the people even lower down, because that is the effect which it has. To establish your views on these candidates, don’t dismiss them simply because you don’t support their party.. Ask the candidatethey can guarantee that they will serve out their term as an MLA , or whether they may walk away from politics after a few months or years, allowing their party to co-opt in a replacement.As the Belfastreported on Saturday, almost a third of MLAs in the last mandate were put into Stormont undemocratically by their parties rather than being elected by voters.Ask the candidate how they would be replaced — will they make public a list of possible replacements, or are you giving their party free reign to anoint someone of whom you may disapprove as your MLA Related topicsThe Executive OfficeNorthern Ireland AssemblyNI ProtocolMore On The Executive Office PremiumGail WalkerOpinionCovid: It hasn’t gone away, you know... and we’ll rue our actions Premium‘Massive anger’ from nationalists at Stormont’s failure, says Aontu leaderFirst Ukrainian refugees have arrived in Northern Ireland after fleeing Russia’s invasion PremiumViewpointOpinionIntegrated schools failure shames NI PremiumSam McBrideOpinionUlster Unionist Party’s all things to all people manesto involves ambition as well as populismMost ReadTeenager dies after M motorway road traffic collisionMan hospitalised following ‘serious’ road collision in County DownJeffrey Donaldson: Problems with Brexit the fault of other partiesUVF demands UDA Rathcoole chief Gary Fisher punishes thug after home attack breached local peace pactStudent stands before court accused of three counts of rapeTop VideosPlayRoy Reynolds just hours before his death videoed with Michael Campbell the man accused of his murderPlayVideo: Police attend sudden death on M motorway outside LurganPlayThe moment a Belfast made Starstreak missile shoots down a Russian helicopter Latest Northern Ireland Assembly election Sam McBrideOpinionBeating Sinn Fein will be hard, but dealing with what comes next will be harderPatient safety warning as GPs call for Stormont Executive revival after electionsAndrew MaddenOpinionElection briefing: DUP and Sinn Fein set out similar plans, bar the NI Protocol, at two very dferent venuesFirst and deputy First Ministers should be filled by the willing – Naomi LongDUP will notto executive without removal of sea border, Donaldson vowsLatestUkraine: First pictures show inside of damaged Mariupol theatreFirmus Energy announces % increase to gas prices across Greater Belfast NetworkIreland’s top  pubs: Three NI bars make the list of best establishments across islandFirmus announces gas price rise of % in Belfast areaWoman in s burgled twice in two days,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Many people would prefer the salesman, but in fact this is a moment where voters hold more power than politicians.Knowing a little bit about how political parties approach canvassing and what they are hoping to achieve can help you to play the system to your advantage — and also help the politicians, eventhat involves the discomfort of hearing your disobliging comments about themselves or their party.Despite all the sophistication of modern politics, knocking doors to persuade a voter to back one candidate over another is still a key element of political success.Two decades ago, a US study by Alan S Gerber and Donald P Green at Yale University found that in a randomised field experiment of , voters in Connecticut voter turnout was increased substantially by personal canvassing, slightly by direct mail, and not at all by telephone calls.They hypothesised that falling electoral turnout was linked to a decline in face-to-face campaigning.Read MoreThe  key questions to ask candidates looking for your voteMuch has changed since then. Social media is now the sexiest tool for political parties and allows those with money to get ultra-targeted messages advertised on the screens of the voters they need — a particular benefit for parties struggling to attract dedicated campaigners to tramp streets.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up But some people — particularly some elderly voters — still value a personal knock on the door, believing thata candidate wants their vote enough they should come and ask for it.However, canvassing is not just one-way traffic.Yes, the canvasser is trying to sell their candidate to you — but they are also harvesting information.It might seem rude when they askyou would vote for their party, but that is part of a vast data-harvesting operation to identy likely voters whose names will be entered in their database .Depending on how likely you say you are to vote, you may be targeted again closer to the election or on polling day as the party moves to its ‘get out the vote’ operation.But they are not just taking in your answer to that one question they are hearing — or should be — what you are saying about other things your reasons for liking their party, your reasons for disliking it, your priorities, the things you think their party has misunderstood about people like you, or whatever it might be that you say.If large numbers of people are saying similar things to a party’s canvassers, the message is taken seriously by any competent party. This is a form of mass polling, and while politicians may say they don’t believe the polls when they deliver unwelcome news, they believe it when they hear it first hand or through colleagues. This is the most nervous time for a politician — especially for one in a party which is losing support.And yet few voters realise that this is the time when their power is greatest. Voters hold in their hands not only the careers of inidual MLAs, but the fates of parties.A veteran of canvassing in Northern Ireland said that % of people “want you off their door as quickly as possible”, and few say much about how they will vote. But that works in favour of those who do engage —you are part of the % who express your views, they will be seen as far more representative than in fact they may be, because so many other people declined to engage.However you engage with canvassers, be respectful — even to those from parties which you may detest. This is about more than basic good manners democracy can only candidates who profoundly disagree with each other put their names forward for election.Whatever you think about the candidates, it takes courage to put yourself up for what is a form of public popularity contest where the result is announced live on TV. It can be humiliating, and involves its own form of bravery.Many of the canvassers will not be politicians, will not be paid, and may not even be members of the party they are advertising.Today we bring you ten questions you can ask those knocking your door to both get across your views and tease out whether they are worthy of your vote.Most ReadTeenager dies after M motorway road traffic collisionMan hospitalised following ‘serious’ road collision in County DownUVF demands UDA Rathcoole chief Gary Fisher punishes thug after home attack breached local peace pactJeffrey Donaldson: Problems with Brexit the fault of other partiesFake nun banned from Clonard Monastery after eccentric behaviourTop VideosPlayVideo: Police attend sudden death on M motorway outside LurganPlayRoy Reynolds just hours before his death videoed with Michael Campbell the man accused of his murderPlayThe moment a Belfast made Starstreak missile shoots down a Russian helicopter Latest Northern Ireland Assembly election Sam McBrideOpinionBeating Sinn Fein will be hard, but dealing with what comes next will be harderPatient safety warning as GPs call for Stormont Executive revival after electionsAndrew MaddenOpinionElection briefing: DUP and Sinn Fein set out similar plans, bar the NI Protocol, at two very dferent venuesFirst and deputy First Ministers should be filled by the willing – Naomi LongDUP will notto executive without removal of sea border, Donaldson vowsLatestViewpointOpinionNo stamp of approval for Royal Mail’s pricesPadraig Harrington vows to retain cool focus at Augusta National in his drive for Masters momentumBriton fears for friend ‘alone in a war zone’ amid Homes For Ukraine delaysEastEnders star Lacey Turner remembers June Brown as being ‘young at heart’Accidental damage claims involving children cost £ typically, says Admiral,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionBusinessSportLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Irsquod just broken up with my first girlfriend and I think it was me subconsciously expressing stuff about that.Confirming the sci-fi influence, Tim mdash who recently became a dad for the first time mdash said Girl From Mars mostly revolves around the verse and chorus.ldquoI wrote them as a slow little strummy thing and then when we worked on it as a band we rocked it out quite a lot. My little brother Pat was always my first port of call of seeinga song was good and then Irsquod bring it to [bandmates] Mark [Hamilton] and Rick [McMurray].ldquoI used to love going and knocking on his bedroom door and playing him ideas and I remember that he flipped out about the song and loved it. He had the idea for the quiet verse after the guitar solo and it was great.Tim said as soon as the band started playing it they got a really good reaction from their friends.ldquoI used to play stuff before Irsquod even fully written the lyrics wersquod play stuff at shows and Irsquod mumble my way through it. I donrsquot think I wrote the second verse until we actually recorded it two years later.ldquoI wasnrsquot too worried about lyrics back then, maybe because I listened to Nirvana so much and could never really understand them. Our manager and the record label were sure it was going to be a hit, so we put it aside until wersquod be able to promote it. We put it out as a single two weeks after leaving school and it just blew up.Meanwhile, as part of the Church Street investment plan in Downpatrick, around pound, has been earmarked for a shop front improvement scheme with the emphasis on painting and repairing existing facades.Elsewhere, it is proposed to spend pound, on what is being described as a ldquoconcept design of Church Street with the work due to be carried out by a consultant, with pound, earmarked for improving shop fronts in Bridge Street.Fteen thousand pounds has been earmarked for De Courcey Place in English Street to replace a number of heritage-style lamps and signposts, alongside the provision of new litter bins and planting out existing granite water troughs.Just over pound, is to be spent on other planting and landscaping schemes in the Church Street area, while there are also proposals for a new bus stop and power washing the area outside the former telephone exchange, with new safety railings installed outside  Church Street.There are also plans to invest pound, on new interpretation material highlighting the Tower Bell at Down Parish Church and the grave of United Irishman Thomas Russell in the church grounds.Last Christmas, new festive lighting was provided on the side of the Down Arts Centre and on trees in De Courcey Place.Downpatrick area councillor Dermot Curran has praised everyone involved with the work in Church Street, in particular, the talented artists responsible for the murals.ldquoCongratulations to everyone involved in the project designed to breath new le into this part of the town. Given the fact that it has missed out on major funding over many years, the pound, investment initiative is particularly welcome, he said.ldquoThe money will help property owners revitalise their respective businesses at a key part of the town where there are a number of family-owned businesses..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Ballynagross make it past Castlewellan  ","story":"BALLYNAGROSS progressed to the final of the Harry Clarke Cup after defeating Castlewellan Forest by way of penalty shoot-out at Ballyhornan on Friday night.Ballynagross arrived at the match looking for a fourth Harry Clarke final in a row, but Castlewellan Forest had momentum following a close win against Ardglass in the quarter-final.Ballynagross got off to the best start they could have hoped for after a great attack from their defence through the field found Philip Doran, who easily finished to put his side one up in the first seven minutes.Castlewellan stepped it up a gear when a throw-in close to the box found Aidan Dornan, who headed just wide.Castlewellan had an appeal for hand ball ruled out closely after in the Ballynagross box, with the referee having none of it.Ballynagross responded to the pressure from Castlewellan with a pass from Philip Doran to Shea McComiskey out on the right wing. McComiskey saw team-mate Joseph Burns in the mouth of the goal and looped the ball in, but Burnsrsquo effort goes just wide.Castlewellan had their first real chance on the th minute when their corner-kick met the head of Donagh Steele. However, the ball went just over the bar.Ballynagross got their second goal on the th minute after a throw-in from Ryan Tumelty to John Shields allowed the attacker to spray a pass to the right wing to find team-mate Doran. The lively lsquoGross forward found Joseph Burns and the chance was duly converted into a goal.With half-time nearing, it looked like Ballynagross would be going into the interval with a comfortable lead, but an error when clearing the ball from the defence enabled Castlewellanrsquos David Gilmore to close the lead to just a goal as the referee blew his whistle.Castlewellan came out in the second-half with an all out attack approach and it paid off through a corner kick in the st minute.This time Donagh Steele ensured the ball was going into the back of the net and the game was level. It was not to stay this way for long as the Castlewellan goalkeeper clearly took Ballynagrossrsquo Shea McComiskey down inside the box and a penalty was awarded.Connor Marron stepped up to take the penalty and finished well into the top left corner of the net.Castlewellan continued to push forward, but Ballynagross defence of Corey Davis, Connor Marron, Ryan Tumelty and Tom McNeill were holding strong.For the next  minutes it was pretty even, Castlewellanrsquos Sean Dornan took a chance on the edge of the box but Cathail Arnold easily saved. Castlewellan were awarded a free-kick close to the Ballynagross net, but David Gilmorersquos effort was straight at the goalkeeper.Ballynagross had a chance from a corner but it was well cleared by Castlewellan.Forest striker Shane Mooney found himself booked for his comments to the referee in the rd minute.Castlewellan were very much seeking out a goal to level and it came in the th minute after a scrap for the ball in Ballynagrossrsquo box resulted in Shane Mooney scoring with the last kick of the game to send the tie to extra-time.There were a few chances during extra-time for Ballynagross, although neither team could find a break through to escape the need for penalties. Castlewellan swapped out Brian McVeigh in goal for Sean Dornan.Ballynagrossrsquo Connor Marron, who had already scored a penalty during the game, was first to step up and easily converted.Castlewellanrsquos Shane Mooney and Ballynagrossrsquo Declan Dowie followed and both scored.Forestrsquos new lsquokeeper Dornan came out of the net and rushed his penalty, sending the ball over the bar.John Mahoney made no mistake to give his lsquoGross side a further advantage before Ciaran Stratton kept Castlewellan in with a chance.Ballynagrossrsquo John Shields walked up to take his penalty but the lsquokeeper saved to bring it level again.Eoin Travers converted his penalty and now it was sudden death.Tom McNeill confidentially scored his penalty meaning all of the pressure fell on Castlewellanrsquos Ryan Morgan to keep the game going.However, his effort was saved resulting in Ballynagross progressing to the final.Ballynagross: C Arnold, T McNeill, R Tumelty, C Marron, C Davis, J Polley, J Shields, J Burns, L Shields, P Doran, S McComiskeySubs: D Craig, D Dowie, J Mahoney, K Taggart, A Beattie.Castlewellan Forest: B McVeigh, C McCabe, C Stratton, C Burns, J OrsquoNeill, N Travers, S Dornan, D Steele, S Mooney, A Dornan, D Gilmore Subs: S Kinley, G Kidd, E Travers, R Morgan, J Murnin..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Dismal end to league campaign  ","story":"DOWN senior footballersrsquo miserable campaign reached its conclusion as they lost out on home soil to Clare on Sunday.The Mourne side entered this fixture already relegated from Division  and were hoping to gain some,any, momentum ahead of their crucial upcoming Ulster campaign.The uphill task will include having to better Monaghan on May  and then the winner of Cavan and Antrim to make the concluding stage to feature in the All-Ireland series and avoid ato the second-tier championship.Down took to the field in Newry against a Clare side who had endured a mixed bag of results within their league fixtures having won their opening three before losing the next trio of matches.For Down, the loss concludes a point-starved run of fixtures having finished with just one draw and six losses.Clare fielded what appeared to be a physically stronger outfit than their counterparts at Paacuteirc Esler and Downrsquos efforts werenrsquot aided by their lack of discipline.Both Gerard Collins and Pat Havern picked up black cards towards the end of each half while team-mate Finn McElroy picked up a red card with  minutes played.By that stage, the Mourne side didnrsquot appear to be getting anything from the game but that will be little solace to Down boss James McCartan, who has endured a nightmare beginning to his second stint at the helm.Aaron Grfin scored the first goal of the match with nine minutes played, courtesy of a smart left-footed finish which bested Kilcoo-native Niall Kane at his near post.To their credit, Down showed some resilience and managed to notch the next four from five points available with Burren man Liam Kerr kicking over a well-taken score amongst these.However, Clare continued to attack the Down goal and found their second major of the match thanks to Cian OrsquoDearsquos effort.His lowly struck shot took the wind out of Downrsquos sails and the Mourne side entered the break six points adrt at -

ndash The Government is poised to unveil an astonishing pound million scheme to replace the Strangford ferry service with a road tunnel under the lough.The scheme has already been approved at ministerial level and it is believed that the pound million originally intended for the Downpatrick bypass road will be used as start-up capital, with phase top-up grants being sought from the European Community and the Ireland Fund as the scheme progresses.Plans for the mile-long road tunnel have been drawn up by senior consultants engaged by the government and it is believed that the entry points will be manned toll booth terminals in Strangford and Portaferry.The move to replace the ferry service with a tunnel received an extra impetus recently when it was revealed that the ferry service was running at a substantial loss and villagers in Strangford vetoed plans for a new jetty for the vessels.Sources within the government say that the tunnel plan, which has been gathering dust for a number of years, has now been reactivated and local roads bosses intend erting the money intended for Downpatrickrsquos ring road to the scheme before the end of the financial year.Publicly, however, officials are remaining tight-lipped about the project. ldquoThe tunnel plan was first put forward several years ago, but as far as I am aware there are no plans to revive it, said a press office spokesperson.Nevertheless, conservation organisations have been consulted about the possible environmental impact of a tunnel, and a study of its possible effects has been carried out by a university team under the guidance of Prof A Lilo.Prof Lilo told the Recorder: ldquoAs far as I can see, there would be little threat to the loughrsquos balanced ecosystem from a tunnel.There may,

the town.ldquoAn investment appraisal has recently been carried out by the Department of Education to consider how best to meet the long-term needs of the pupils at St Malachyrsquos and this has come out in favour of a new school on the existing site, he added.Mr McGrady said this week: ldquoI welcome this development as I have been making on-going representations on the matter to Lord Belstead

ndash Teenagers, some as young as , are taking part in open-air drinking parties at secluded parts of Downpatrick it was revealed this week.The youth are paying adults to buy drink for them and then going to quiet parts of the town for their parties, a special meeting was told on Tuesday.The police have raided a number of these gatherings in recent months but the teenagers simply move to a dferent location and continue their drinking sprees.While the problem of underage drinking in Downpatrick has not risen in recent years it is nevertheless sufficiently worrying to prompt a group of local community representatives to get together to discuss ways of tackling the issue.Last week youth workers, headmasters, teachers, publicans and councillors met together under the auspices of the RUCrsquos Community Relations Branch and debated the causes and possible remedies of underage drinking.The end result of the discussion was that public awareness needs to be heightened, while teenagers, and their parents, should be appraised of the dangers of alcohol abuse in the young.Superintendent Ronnie Hawthorne, Downpatrick sub-isional commander explained that the problem is a province-wide concern and is not just confined to Downpatrick.He added that underage drinking is also taking place in other parts of Down District.ldquoThere is a problem throughout Northern Ireland and we cannot stop underage drinkers ourselves, we need the help of the whole community, said Superintendent Hawthorne.ldquoThere are a lot associated problems with underage drinking and we will talk to every interested body in a bid to cope with this matter, he added.The full extend of the problems were highlighted by the youth leader in charge of the Patrician Youth Centre, Siobhan Byrne, who

officially launched proposals for the regeneration of the town.A special exhibition in the townrsquos library also features a display on the proposed conservation area for Killyleagh.Mr Quinn referred to community-led initiatives in Seeconnell and Strangford, and stressed the importance of a community coming together to take full advantage of the funding which is available to help themselves.The

marked on ordnance survey maps dating from , sketches from the town lands of Slievenisky and Backaderry, through Carrivmoragh mountain and descends towards Leitrim by Heronrsquos Road.Local people claim that the path is very old and was once used to reach a Mass Rock on the Backaderry Mountain and in later times, to give a short-cut to the new church in Leitrim.It is also believed the footpath is part of the old highway system that existed before the road system was introduced, and links into a system of lanes that go to Ballynahinch.The Council first became involved in the matter in August  when the petition was formally presented, and shortly afterwards the council voted overwhelmingly to adopt the pathway, subject to legal opinions.However, for the next  months no progress was made on the matter until the council appointed a countryside officer in August . He prepared a report on the footpath, which came before the council earlier this month when it was decided not to adopt itAfterwards a statement from some of the local people seeking the right-of-way said the footpath passes over land belonging to  dferent families and only one has an objection to the council adopting it..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Good Morning Down co","story":"THE head of one of the districtrsquos leading charities is officially stepping down from her role next month.Linda Baker has been Good Morning Downrsquos co-ordinator for the past  years and has watched the organisation mdash which provides a telephone befriending service to elderly and vulnerable people across the district mdash increases its operation considerably.The charity provides a valuable leline service to many people across the district, with its hardworking volunteers in regular contact with those who feel vulnerable or at risk, making telephone calls to members at an agreed time each morning.Linda said the service was especially important during the height of the coronavirus pandemic with the deadly virus unfortunately curtailing get-togethers that were organised for clients.Working in partnership with the districtrsquos Policing and Community Safety Partnership, the South Eastern Trust and the Housing Executive, the charity has also received invaluable support from the Allen Lane Foundation and and Halax Community Foundation.ldquoWhen I joined Good Morning Down there were four volunteers making calls to around  people.

They also cause signicant damage to wildle and the environment.Mourne Heritage Trust staff helped with the response to last weekrsquos wildfires using strimmers to create fire breaks, also helping with a controlled back burn and using its argocat all-terrain vehicle and fogging unit to extinguish one branch of a fire that was threatening some field boundaries.In addition, one of the Trustrsquos teams, along with a firefighter, used this specialist equipment to extinguish the fire at Finlieve near Rostrevor.NI Water has also warned that wildfires can have impact on drinking water supplies.The organisation controls so-called water catchment areas in the Mournes which supply water to all of Northern Ireland. The organisation said while it is working hard to deal with the problem of wildfires, it wants to assure customers that tap water quality is unaffected and is of a very high quality.But NI Water has warned that wildfires within catchments not only pose a terrible risk to all le but can remove the primary layer of vegetation, leaving the burned bare soil exposed to erosion which then makes its way into the reservoirs, from where water is abstracted for treatment to provide drinking water.ldquoThe erosion caused by wildfire increases carbon and other polluting chemicals signicantly in untreated water, with sediment accumulating in streams, lakes and reservoirs, said NI Waterrsquos Rebecca Allen.ldquoThis makes raw water especially dficult and more expensive to treat at our facilities to the stringent standards required by the Drinking Water Regulations. A signicant amount of other work by our water supply colleagues also has to be undertaken at the treatment works to ensure excellent quality drinking water during these times.Rebecca added: ldquoExtra water samples have to be collected and analysed, streams from burned areas need isolated, and other remedial measures must be taken like blocking streams to protect reservoirs.Mournes councillor Willie Clarke has praised firefighters, other arms of the emergency services and the Mourne Heritage Trust for their efforts to bring the blaze at the Bloody Bridge under control.He said firefighters in particular were overwhelmed by the support from the community.ldquoI witnessed the devastation of the wildfire first hand which impacted a site that is a protected habitat renowned around the world, said Cllr Clarke.ldquoThe emergency services, particularly local fire crews, should be commended for the professionalism they displayed when dealing with these incidents. However, malicious fires place a massive strain on very limited resources and as we approach the summer I would urge people to be vigilant and report any suspicious activity to the PSNI.Cllr Clarke said the damage caused by gorse fires has a lasting impact and that areas of outstanding natural beauty can take years to recover, calling for a co-ordinated response from the Department for Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs, NI Water, health and public safety departments and the Department of Justice.He continued: ldquoWe need to see a collective response with a sharing of resources and there needs to be additional funding provided to build upon the best practice Mourne Heritage Trust has undertaken to reduce the impact of these fires in the High Mournes. Controlled burns and better land-management needs to be re-established.ldquoMeasures should include the establishment of fire breaks to reduce the fuel load and a cross-departmental strategic response to ensure that the scale of these fires should never happen again.Cllr Clarke said it is important that police proactively investigate what are environmental crimes and those responsible need to be assured that these types of crime will not be tolerated in society.South Down MLA Sinead Ennis has also praised firefighters for their efforts in battling huge fires in the Mournes which started at Hen Mountain and Spelga Dam.She added: ldquoTragically, these fires will have caused widespread damage to the environment and our wildle. This is yet another stark reminder that everyone must behave responsibly while visiting the Mournes in order to protect the environment and the safety of the local community..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Reality TV star Matthew visits ex primary school  ","story":"FRESH from Dancing With The Stars Ireland, TV star Matthew MacNabb and his new girlfriend took the chance to visit his former primary school last week.Matthew and his professional dance partner, Laura Nolan, visited St Patrickrsquos Primary School, Legamaddy, after making it to the semi-final of the top RTE show.The visit to the school, which the Downpatrickrsquos manrsquos brother and sisters also attended, coincided with the school celebrating news of receiving a sizeable grant.It has been awarded pound, which will go towards creating a pollinator garden in the school grounds.Pupils were delighted to show Matthew and Laura around the school, particularly its new outdoor learning hub which allows to have an outdoor classroom for eco projects.The schoolrsquos Eco teacher, Mrs Bronagh Reid, said the school was delighted to welcome Matthew back.ldquoHe was very friendly to all the pupils, who found him very inspiring, said Mrs Reid. ldquoIt was good that he called with us on a day off and it was down to his mother Margaret, who sits on our board of governors.ldquoWe were all hoping that Matthew would make into the final but very impressed that he cog to the semi-final.The schoolrsquos cash injection is part of the Rural Community Pollinator Grants Scheme, which is financed by the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairsand managed by the civic-pride campaign, Live Here Love Here.It is designed to allow community groups and schools across rural Northern Ireland to benefit from funding between pound, to pound, to establish, enhance or develop a local community pollinator garden.A pollinator garden is a shared space with pollinating plants, habitats, wildflowers, flowers, shrubs and trees, and the grants support new initiatives aimed at protecting and providing for pollinators.Mrs Sarah McDowell, principal, said: ldquoWe plan to use the money to create an outdoor learning space which will enhance our school grounds and the local community.ldquoWe will build an outdoor classroom and plant fruit trees to attract more wildle to our school grounds.`We are delighted to receive the support of Live Here Love Here to help us create this space which will benefit the children in our school and will help to improve bioersity in the area.She added: ldquoWe look forward to starting to create this area after Christmas and have it ready for the spring term.The pilot scheme, which made pound. million available for  , aims to cover % of costs to community groups and schools wishing to embark on the community environmental project.Successful grant applicants were required to illustrate their plans to maximise pollinator-friendly land-management techniques to increase the bioersity value of an area by planting for pollinators, and to transform unused spaces into valued community spaces, adding habitats and greening-up formerly grey areas..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Students involved in All Island lights switch off climate event  ","story":"THE lights went out at Stormont at the weekend thanks to ecologically aware local high school studentsA group of pupils from St Patrickrsquos Grammar School and Down High School, who are involved in the All-Island Schools  Climate Action programme, asked for the lights at Stormont to be switched off for one hour on Saturday evening.Local MLAs Harry Harvey and Colin McGrath helped ensure that the request was fast-tracked, with Mr Harveyrsquos we, Sharon, doing a lot of the work behind the scenes.Mr Harvey met with staff and pupils from the two schools in the grounds of Parliament Buildings to observe the dimming of the lights.Stormont joined in solidarity with the  countries from around the world that participated in the th anniversary of the global Earth Hour.

We have so much for which to be thankful here, and I hope our celebration will set the tone for our worship and thanksgiving in the days and years to come..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Tourism centre closure blasted  ","story":"THE closure of a dedicated tourism information centre in Downpatrick has been heavily criticised by two politicians.Cllrs Cadogan Enright and Patrick Brown have also criticised their Newry, Mourne and Down Council colleagues for agreeing to the closure of the tourist information centre housed within the St Patrick Centre.The role of the two council staff who manned the tourist information centre will now be handled by St Patrick Centre employees.Cllr Enright is also concerned that a proposal he tabled at a recent council meeting for the issue to be further discussed was rejected.ldquoTo suggest that the Saint Patrickrsquos Centre can somehow pick up the slack on its diminished funding makes no sense, he declared. ldquoWe need a full time tourism office working seven days a week in Downpatrick.Cllr Enright said the local authority runs tourism information centres in Newcastle, Kilkeel, Newry and CrossmaglenHe insisted that the Downpatrick area, regarded by many as the jewel in the local councilrsquos tourism crown, cannot become an afterthought when it comes to tourism promotion.Cllr Brown said he was ldquomost disturbed by the development, which ldquoworryingly follows on the back of the scaling-down of the Down County Museum.He continued: ldquoIt is unreasonable for Newry, Mourne and Down Council to expect the Saint Patrick Centre to pick up the slack from the loss of these two tourism staff with no increase in funding, he continued.ldquoFunding for the Centre was slashed from pound, per annum to pound, per annum  years ago, with the local council paying pound, in rent for the tourism centre located in the building.ldquoThis means that the Centre has had to manage on pound, per annum with no inflation adjustment for over  years and now must cover the work of two full-time council staff.He added: ldquoNo matter what way the issue is spun, it is about a net cut in essential frontline tourism services which are key to tourism growth and economic development in this area.ldquoWhile I am aware of the huge amount of voluntary work and fundraising that goes on at the Saint Patrick Centre, to suggest that it can easily take up the slack for two full-time council staff looks very improbable to me.ldquoThese two posts were redeployed during Covid- and I want them reinstated..prettyPhoto"},{"url":null,"title":"support for irish unity gives hope to nationalism ","story":"PremiumOpposition to Irish unity remains strong at . per cent but nationalist commentators are encouraged by figures in today#s Institute of Irish Studies-University of Liverpool The Irish NewsRead More"},{"url":null,"title":"west belfast pensioner burgled twice in two days ","story":"Police in west Belfast are appealing for informationafter the home of a woman in her s was burgled twice in two days.The most recent burglary of the Bearnagh Drive house was in the early hours of Tuesday when jewellery and money were reported stolen.The previous day, thewoman#s handbag containing a large sum of money, bank cards andgt voucherswas taken.Detective Sergeant NatalieAsh said: ldquoThese areappalling crimes and willcause real shockto the local community.

Also that no Bill of Rights specic to NI is introduced here. Separate bases for rights legislation on either side of the Irish Sea would be yet another step towards all island policy making. ——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThe owner of Coaltown Coffee was still just a teenager when he started up his business – then called Roasted Joe’s – in  after leaving secondary school with no qualications.Nearly a decade after dad Gordon helped him build his first roaster, Coaltown’s products are being savoured around the world and the company is continuing to go from strength to strength.With the support of Gordon and mum Jennine, Scott has made a big mark on his hometown of Ammanford, with their Foundry Road roastery popular among locals and those from further afield.Given that his parents used to run their own café and older generations of the family were grocers and restaurateurs, it is perhaps no surprise that the coffee industry has been Scott’s calling.Great-grandfather Ben, a miner in the former coal town, inspired the rebranding of the company, and Scott hasn’t looked back since ditching the Roasted Joe’s name.“The mining industry was a big part of everyday le in this area and that’s gone, it’s been completely wiped out,” he told the Welsh Business Heroes webinar.“It was really impactful, and the idea of that industry that’s no longer here was very much the inspiration behind what we wanted to do with the brand, which is where the name came from.“We were doing some research into the mining industry and one of the terms for what they called coal was ‘black gold’.“Coal gave a massive amount of employment and industry to the area, and, when you look at coffee, black gold is the same term used for coffee growing regions.“They are two very dferent worlds but are tied together through black gold.”In , Coaltown became one of the first coffee companies in the UK to be B Corp certied, meaning they are committed to prioritising the environment and society in how they do business..removeAnd that ethical approach to doing things has, according to Scott, always been at the forefront of his mind as an entrepreneur.“We went on a trip to New York to see my favourite roasteries,” he said.“I can’t stress enough how massively influential that trip was. You really do need to go somewhere and soak it all in because it just inspires you and makes you have a completely dferent approach to what you do.“That’s where I first encountered Square as a brand before they opened in the UK, and it was also where I first encountered B Corp.“It’s a universally adopted accreditation which allows you to implement a lot of sustainability ethics into one brand.“B Corp is a really good thing for giving you a general overview of everything you do as a business.“What B Corp means is that you are putting your planet before profit and your business as a force for good and change before anything .“I don’t think any business opening as a fresh start-up today can open without that in mind. It’s not a tradable landscape for you to be able to grow within.“You have to have that ethical approach to everything you do.“B Corp, as a brand, really summed up everything we were as a business “We were awarded that in December  and announced it in late January , and we were the first specialty roastery in UK to get it so we were very proud of that.“It was a big feat because we were up against some really big players in the UK.“We all have the ambition to be ethical and do the best we can, but to get that certication first was a really big thing for us.“It’s looking at how you run your business from the ground up.“As a brand, we’ve been purpose driven, so it’s about how we can bring a new industry to our hometown, and now post-industrial towns across the UK.“It has always been our intention to have an ethical brand.“Essentially, the coal industry is the opposite of what we are, we’re trying to be the opposite of what the coal industry was with fossil fuels and bad carbon.”Watch the Welsh Business Heroes episode featuring Scott James of Coaltown Coffee in its entirety here - www.youtube watch vKZFsjhVei article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

A five-point buffer on fth place, plus a game in hand on Tottenham, puts the Blues in a strong position to prevent a calamitous end to a turbulent campaign. Balancing FA Cup and Champions League commitments could complicate matters but Thomas Tuchel’s men are in control of their own fate, including having to face four of their nearest rivals.Tottenham  vw,vw,px, px\"Antonio Conte’s Tottenham climbed to fourth by thrashing Newcastle - Remaining fixtures: Aston VillaBrightonBrentfordLeicesterLiverpoolArsenalBurnleyNorwich .Tottenham’s top-four hopes were written off by many less than two months ago when they slipped to eighth. But six wins from eight outings since has thrust Antonio Conte’s men into pole position for fourth. While they have played a game more than Arsenal, next month’s rescheduled north London derby means Spurs are effectively in control of their own destiny.

Mikel Arteta is operating with a slim squad and currently has limited options at full-back and up front. Yet it is far from doom and gloom for the Gunners. Facing Cha, Manchester United, West Ham and Spurs in the space of  days is likely to define their season as they bid toto European football’s top club competition for the first time since the days of Arsene Wenger.West Ham  vw,vw,px, px\"David Moyes is chasing Europa League glory and Champions League qualication Remaining fixtures: BrentfordBurnleyChaArsenalNorwichManchester CityBrighton .Aside from Cha, West Ham are the only top-four hopefuls juggling interest where. The Hammers are chasing Europa League glory and begin their two-legged quarter-final tie with Lyon on Thursday. David Moyes’ side fell agonisingly short of Champions League qualication late last term. They are already reliant on favours from where to prevent a repeat.

Ajax boss Erik Ten Hag and Paris St Germain’s Mauricio Pochettino remain the front-runners. Champions League football would undoubtedly make them a more attractive proposition for a new manager and potential summer signings. However, current odds do not appear favourable and a string of draws – nine in total – could ultimately prove their undoing.Wolves  vw,vw,px, px\"Bruno Lage’s Wolves retain faint hope of a top-four finish Remaining fixtures: NewcastleBurnleyBrightonChaNorwichLiverpoolManchester City .Even the most optimistic Wolves fan is unlikely to be dreaming of a maiden Champions League campaign.

Speaking about this project, Lord Mayor Alderman Glenn Barr said: “Banbridge is a town on the up and the new street art positively reinforces this.        \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"     \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily NorthernIrelandWorld Today newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Their creative and inspirational designs will help create a good first impression among international visitors coming to the area to experience the Game of Thrones Studio Tour.“I am looking forward to seeing further regeneration work get underway in Banbridge as part of our Arrivals Project - all of which will create a high quality environment and support the town’s long-term economic and social prosperity.” Irish-Singaporean illustrator and muralist Holly Pereira was inspired by the area’s unique connection to the Brontë family. Her hand-painted ‘Welcome to Banbridge’ mural in Newry Street celebrates the Brontë link to the area using typography inspired by the world’s most famous literary family.Artist Friz pays homage to the town’s most famous landmark and Europe’s first ever flyover, Downshire Bridge. The mural of Irish physicist Professor Ernest Walton at Bridge Street. Picture: Edward Byrne PhotographyHer mural in Downshire Place depicts an old woman who used to sell apples on the bridge and jingle the money in her pocket, giving it the affectionate local nickname Jingler’s Bridge. Inspired by the area’s linen history, Rob Hilken’s mural at Linenhall Street depicts damask linen with a Jacquard weaving pattern that was created by local linen mills. The chrysanthemum damask design used was created by William Liddell and incorporates the distinctive pattern found on Jacquard loom punch cards, which were used to create the complex damask designs that made the Banbridge area world-famous for its linen.Belfast-based artist and illustrator FGB’smural at Bridge Street celebrates the town’s association to Irish physicist Professor Ernest Walton who was educated at Banbridge Academy Preparatory School. Friz at Downshire Place. Picture: Edward Byrne PhotographyHe won the  Nobel Prize in Physics for his pioneering work on splitting the atom nucleus. Dublin-based Decoy’s mural at Scarva Street celebrates Banbridge as a strategic river crossing point, a communication route between Belfast and Dublin and a focus for agricultural industry, trade and commerce. An ancient king’s road connecting Ulster to the rest of the island once crossed the Bann at a forging place a short distance downstream at Ballykeel.In addition to the new street art, one of Banbridge’s most iconic landmarks - a B-listed monument dedicated to Captain Crozier which memorialises his contribution to polar exploration - has undergone signicant restoration work.Holly Pereira on Newry Street.

Do something instead‘Don’t worry!’ How often have we heard that and how often do we say it to others  I suspect it’s being said quite often at the present time, when there seems to be so much to be worried about, writes Rev. Ron Elsdon.By The NewsroomSunday, rd April , : am  \"       \"  There’s the state of the Health Service, the never-ending fallout from Brexit, the war in Ukraine, and the spiralling cost of living which is already inflicting so much hardship on so many. ‘Don’t worry!’ But the problem is that it’s far easier said than done. So when you come across it in the bible as well, you could be excused for writing it off as unrealistic. Please stay with me for a few moments, however, while I try to explain.        \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"     \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily NorthernIrelandWorld Today newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

It points you to something rather more than that. I offer you two examples where it offers you responses that are practical – strategies,you like.Ron ElsdonFirstly, Paul directs people to pray instead, and to pepper their prayers with thanksgiving . The trouble is that we’re so good at finding things to complain about, often trivialities, that finding things to give thanks for doesn’t come easily, even to people who pray regularly, but why not switch course and actually do it, then keep on doing it  Then, says Paul, the protecting peace of God is there to be discovered, even in the midst of stressful situations. Secondly, Jesus talks about worry in the Sermon on the Mount . When it consumes us, he says, what we need is a new set of ambitions which point us beyond ourselves “Seek first God’s kingdom and God’s righteousness” is His command to His followers. As I write, I’m thinking about a local politician, one I shan’t be voting for. I know he spends Christmas Day at a place for the homeless, helping to serve up hot meals for that I admire him greatly. As I write, hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians are fleeing the army of a tyrant from the east, many with nowhere to go in freezing weather. In neighbouring countries, churches and other organisations are swinging into action to help support these folk in their hour of desperate need. So, in their dferent ways, Jesus’ and Paul’s words in the bible are saying to us all, ‘Don’t worry! Do something instead.’Read: Covid travel requirement set to change"},{"url":null,"title":"late s and early s ballyclare may fair era captured in rhymes and ructions ","story":"Entertainer William Caulfield banned for driving up to an estimated ‘mph’   Young teenager dies in M motorway crash between Lurgan and MoiraNewsCoronavirusTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsHealthBusinessEducationPeopleEnvironmentRead ThisUkraine CrisisFootballIrish League FootballSportMotorcyclingIce HockeyOther SportWhats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyleFood and DrinkTravelHomes and GardensCars FamilyYour NIRetroOpinionAdvertise My Businesscanonical_urlCANONICAL_URLhostnameCANONICAL_HOSTNAMElocationCANONICAL_URLreferrerEXTERNAL_REFERRERpage_view_id_PAGE_VIEW_ID_scroll_SCROLL_HEIGHTgeo__INJECT_GEO__cid_ga:CLIENT_ID,comScore:CLIENT_ID,compass_uid:CLIENT_IDversionsha-wJFtySqNnAxBmRbBZGkmXyZeJTYkxlpMdJsFNIrrGVlru-DcIEIZ\" class\"i-amphtml-layout-container\" i-amphtml-layout\"container\"Loading...NewsPeopleLate s and early s Ballyclare May Fair era captured in ‘Rhymes and Ructions’The halcyon days of music and merriment in Ballyclare in the run up to the annual May Fair are revisited in a new publication by author and local historian Jack McKinney.By The NewsroomFriday, st April , : pm  \"       \"  ‘Rhymes and Ructions’ - with its eye-catching and locally-linked front and back covers - refers to the title of a series of concerts organised by the Ballyclare and District Historical Society in the town in the late s and early s. With his ear for a good story and eye for detail, Jack, who founded the historical group in , takes readers on a mirthful trip down memory lane.       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"     \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily NorthernIrelandWorld Today newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

They gradually gained popularity with the audience and, being held on the Monday night before the annual May Fair Day, reflected the atmosphere of jollication that pervaded the town at this special time of year.An eye-catching image from Ballyclare.“The music was provided by ious groups of instrumentalists – fiddlers, accordionists, tin whistle players – and their sessions were interspersed with songs, recitations and stories by local inidual entertainers drawn from the lore and culture of the Six Mile Water region. Many of these songs and much of the material came from an oral tradition and few were available in written form.”Verses of material from local ‘balladeers’ Ernie Scott, Sandy Robinson, Jock Gilmour and Matt Meharg together with short biographical details of these and many others feature in the pages of the book.Jack continued: “Sadly the concerts came to an end when the security situation dictated that crowds gathering in halls became impossible. The Historical Society planned to celebrate the th anniversary of the founding of the society in  by reviving the Rhymes and Ructions concert in  but the outbreak of the Covid- pandemic put paid to their plans.”In his introduction to Rhyme and Ructions Jack, who is the author of a number of local history studies including ‘Stories of a Letime’, also reveals what inspired this latest publication.Author Jack McKinney with his latest publication.“What I am endeavouring to do here is to compile a collection of the ballads and anecdotes that proved so popular at the concerts. The tone and subjects of the ballads y considerably from the amusing to those of a more contemplative nature. As for their credibility I leave the readers to assess this for themselves.”Jack has pursued his interest in local history and its characters with zeal since retiring in  after a four-decade career as an assistant and principal teacher in east Antrim primary schools. The former Mossley Primary School pupil, taught at Abbots Cross, Ballyclare and Whitehead Primary Schools. And in the manner in which he inspired many pupils, Jack is keen to share his enthusiasm for knowledge with a whole new generation of readers.A founder member of the Ulster-Scots Language Society, Jack added: “The ballads are recorded in the style of language used in the originals – standard English or Ulster- Scots. The stories and other text may contain either or both. I have often followed the style of a mixture of Ulster -Scots and English as in the Scottish ‘Kaleyard’ novels, familiar to readers of Archibald McIlroy’s books, where the conversational dialogue of characters is in Ulster-Scots with the rest of the narrative in standard English.”The ‘Wreck of the Never Budge’, ‘Courting and Possible Consequences’ or ‘The May Fair and lots of Houzeldoo’ provide a hint of Ballyclare May Fairs past and possible inspiration for future balladeers and storytellers.

With the signicant rise in the cost of living, particularly the continued increase in gas and electricity prices, many are struggling to provide the basics of food and heat. Recent research indicated that one in every four children in Northern Ireland are living in a family which is struggling to provide basic requirements of heat, food, clothing, and childcare. Under these pressures many families are at risk of getting into further debt and are heavily reliant on food banks to supplement their financial situation. Carol Ervine, Choice Group Director of Tenant and Client Services said,“As an organisation we are committed to providing more than bricks and mortar and realise that whilst having a home is a human right, there are many who are living with the real threat of poverty and financial instability. With the cost of living continuing to rise, the cost of the weekly shop has become signicantly higher, and many families are making the decision between heating or eating. Working with the Trussell Trust, we are able to provide much needed food parcels to families in need, with the knowledge that this will ease at least part of the burden. The Trussell Trust support a UK network of food banks providing emergency food and support to people in poverty whilst campaigning for change to end the need for food banks in the UK. The Trust recently outlined that in the year  , .m food bank parcels were given to people in crisis in the past year across the UK with close to , emergency food parcels distributed across Northern Ireland in the same period. Jonny Currie, Northern Ireland Network Lead from the Trussell Trust said,“We welcome this partnership with Choice Housing providing vital support to our network of food banks in Northern Ireland. Food banks and their volunteers are extraordinary, and their response to need in their communities is inspiring. But that kind of response shouldn’t be needed. In the last year in Northern Ireland almost , emergency food parcels were provided by food banks in the Trussell Trust’s network – and more than , of these were for children. It’s not right that some of us cannot afford our own food.That’s why we are working towards a just, compassionate future, where no one should have to use a food bank to get by. Choice also manage a Financial Inclusion programme, through which they are supporting tenants to improve their money management, ensuring they can maximise their income. In the last year this programme helped tenants access pound. million in financial gains, and specialised staff at Choice are continuing to help tenants with benefits, debt, and budgeting advice.  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_fcefabfacfe   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_afbcdaffadc   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
