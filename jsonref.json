When he first moved to the square in 1985, the property would cost £65,000 on average. A huge 1,042 per cent increase since then means despite he is now sitting on £743,000.Yet the average small business owner only takes home around £29,000 a year, meaning he would be some way short of the £148,609 minimum income required to secure a mortgage were he to buy the same house today.  Ken Barlow (left) first appeared on the soap in 1960. Right: his home on Coronation StreetCharlie Fairfield has been a prominent figure in Casualty since 1986, and the average semi-detached property in Bristol has increased from £43,845 to £474,225 - a staggering increase of 982 per cent. Yet Charlie\u0027s modern-day NHS wage of £26,252 means he would be priced out of the market by more than £68,000, meaning his annual income would have to be £94,845 in order to be accepted for a mortgage. Emmerdale\u0027s Eric Pollard would also struggle to get his foot on the housing ladder today, as a detached house in Arncliff has increased by more than 2,000 per cent in value since he arrived on the show in 1986.          Each soap stars average salary for their job, required income for a mortgage now and the affordability gap between what they earn and need for a mortgage Based on the average income of B\u0026ampB owners, Eric would be nearly £63,000 short of the £91,937 income required to secure a mortgage.  The longest-serving soap star included on the fitures, Christine Barford of the Archers, would have been on around £54,000 as a stable owner before she retired.Having bought in 1953 for little over £2,000, the price of a detached home in Cutnall Green would have increased by 21,355 per cent today.Yet were she to buy today, she would be just over £44,000 of the £98,992 needed to secure a mortgage.          Eric Pollard, as played by Chris Chittell, would struggle to afford his property if he were buying it today  The Grange Bed and Breakfast in Emmerdale The same goes for Tony Hutchinson, Ken Barlow, Jac Naylor and Hywel Llywelyn, who would all be priced out of their respective local markets if they tried to buy today.  Only Jimmi Clay could afford his property today with his GP salary of nearly £70,000 when securing a mortgage in Birmingham. Alastair McKee, Managing Director of One77 Mortgages, commented: \u0027Unfortunately for our best-loved soap stars, the cost of getting on the ladder today would see many of them resigned to the rental sector.           Graphic shows the average price when the characters moved into their home compared to what it is in the current housing climate          Only Jimmi Clay could afford to buy the property he now lives in, according to new figures\u0027Luckily for them, they took that first step when prices weren\u0027t as high and as a result have benefited from some very healthy price growth across the board. \u0027Of course, this research is just a bit of fun and in many cases mortgage affordability would be bolstered by a partner or spouses\u0027 income, but it does raise a more serious issue. \u0027Regardless of property type, profession and location, there is a huge disparity between the price of UK property and the wages on offer and it highlights the struggle facing many aspirational buyers today when trying to secure a mortgage.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"Samantha Markle calls Meghan bulls story imaginary pals praised princess","story":"    Brave: Meghan Markle (above last Friday) was praised in a glowing People profile that featured interviews with five anonymous friends who were tired of seeing the princess be bullied          Counterpoint: \u0027#PeopleMagazine this article is total bulls*** there are plenty of text messages and receipts to prove otherwise.

He will continue presenting Mastermind, and has a book due out in the autumn about his years as a Today journalist.Speaking to Sarah Montague – who was his colleague on Today for 17 years – he said: ‘I genuinely, genuinely worry about what it is going to be like not doing the Today programme.’Asked whether he would tune in after his departure, he said: ‘Ah, that’s the big one, isn’t it?

A. Milne\u0027s poem Now We Are Six ends: \u0027But now I am six, I\u0027m as clever as clever. So I think I\u0027ll be six now for ever and ever.\u0027 That\u0027s how I felt that day. Over subsequent decades my \u0027spirit age\u0027 was mostly far older than my real vintage.The first LP I bought, aged 12, from the Cirencester branch of FW Woolworth, was Bach\u0027s Brandenburg Concertos. As a teenager I ached to wear baggy corduroys and smoke a pipe. I have owned only one pair of jeans and they were not a success.          Quentin Letts says his spirit age is around one year older than his actual age At university in Ireland I hated the pressure to be \u0027with it\u0027 and dated a beautiful Belfast artist who was ten years my senior. As a 30-year-old reporter, I envied older journalists who had seen the world and mastered their craft.When I married Lois in 1996, I knew she was a cracker yet felt itchy when grannies cooed over us as \u0027love\u0027s young dream\u0027 and told us: \u0027It\u0027s all in front of you.\u0027 I didn\u0027t want to be young. I wanted to be established, successful, my own man, with a lawnmower and a drinks cabinet and shoe-trees.Now I\u0027ve got them and it feels right.In The Idiot, Dostoyevsky writes that 56 is the age at which real life can begin: a \u0027fine complexion, sound though discoloured teeth, a stocky, solid figure, a preoccupied air in the morning, a gay face in the evening\u0027.There is also, though this he omitted, a disposition to pity anyone younger, and a sense of relief to have left behind youth\u0027s gulping gawkishness. Thank heavens for middle age.EVEN AT 56 I STILL GET SCHOOLGIRL CRUSHESSusannah ConstantineReal age: 56. Spirit age: 16.          Susannah Constantine \u0027still get schoolgirl crushes\u0027So, Christie Brinkley jokes that she\u0027s turning 50 for the 15th time, declaring her spirit age is far younger than her 65 years. Why has she chosen an age that is ten years older than she looks?When it comes to how I feel, I\u0027d put it at somewhere around 16. I still get schoolgirl crushes and it would be wonderful to have no responsibilities. Often, I see myself in my children and it makes me laugh when I tell them to behave or grow up, when inside I\u0027m wanting to do exactly the same as them, despite the statins, hot flushes and insomnia.I yearn to eat rubbish as often as I like without pumping up the cholesterol levels. I\u0027d love to be able to sleep until noon. It would be heaven to have a night on the tiles and not look like stale bread the next morning.Sadly, at the ripe old age of 56, it would be unwise to live my spiritual age because it could take me to an early grave.    Henry Deedes\u0027s spirit age is the age he got married My spirit age — 28 — is the age I got married. That\u0027s not a dig at my ex-wife, we had many wonderful times. Still do. But I feel younger now than I did then.Midlife complacency set in prematurely after marrying. The burden of responsibility meant I neglected myself.Week nights covering the canape-and-Krug party circuit had left my skin sallow, my belly blubberous. Home life was often a whir of bills and builders as I tottered under the weight of a mortgage bigger than the Brexit orce fee.These days, I eat better, drink less and am mildly more solvent. Frequent exercise means I can wear T-shirts again without feeling like a lager-tummied extra from Benidorm. That feeling of youthful spontaneity is wonderful. I have a sense of adventure again.Every now and again I get a quick reality check. Hangovers get harder. Hair gets greyer. And yesterday I ordered a hip support from Amazon to wear in the gym — but let\u0027s not dwell on that.CHILDREN CAN TELL I\u0027M NOT A GROWN-UPRowan PellingReal age: 51. Spirit age: 15.I have never lied about my age and told everyone when I turned 50 last year. But that might be because I am certain, deep down, that the largest part of me remains resolutely 15.          Rowan Pelling never lied about her age I have spent my life avoiding certain adult responsibilities (tax returns, form-filling, housework, the duller side of childrearing) and veering off into my own vivid, imaginary world.I still make the kind of intense friendships I made at school and like sloping away from chores like a naughty schoolgirl having a ciggie behind the bike sheds.My life would have fallen apart, I suspect, if I hadn\u0027t married a proper grown-up who provides the necessary domestic balance. I happily wear clothes many peers would judge to be age-inappropriate, such as skinny jeans, short skirts and bikinis, and only yesterday I received a Sex Pistols T-shirt in the post.Children (little girls in particular) often recognise I\u0027m not a real grown-up and are happy to talk to me about unicorns, imaginary friends and dragons. If there\u0027s a trampoline or a game of \u0027It\u0027, I\u0027m first in the queue.My chief guilty pleasure is nestling in an armchair with a clutch of favourite children\u0027s books.I don\u0027t think I chase youth: I\u0027ve never had Botox or filler and I\u0027m happy with my wrinkles. But I suspect feeling young is what makes a person buzz, not looking it. If I were ever to have a tattoo, then it would say simply: \u0027There are no rules.\u0027IN MY DREAMS I\u0027M 17 AND A RUGBY HEROStanley JohnsonReal age: 78. Spirit age: 17.          Stanley Johnson dreams of being a rugby hero Even now, I dream about my schooldays when I played prop in rugby for Sherborne, aged 17.The other side (Marlborough? Clifton?) kicks off. I catch the ball full-toss and charge straight for the line, looking neither right nor left, to score under the posts.Of course, I\u0027m not arguing that the grit and determination you acquire on the rugger field as a schoolboy is the end of the story. Yes, I wanted to gain a rugger blue at Oxford after I left school, but I also wanted to get a First and be President of the Union.As it happened, I flunked all three goals, but there was one great consolation prize which I have cherished all my life: I won the Newdigate Prize for poetry with a 98-line poem called May Morning. I had to recite it at the university\u0027s summer prize-giving ceremony, Encaenia.Charlie Chaplin was one of those honoured that year. He signed my programme and, 56 years later, I still have it.In a nutshell, my spirit age still hovers around 17. I have the sense that even though I hung up my boots years ago, it\u0027s worth charging full-tilt towards the goal.BEING A YOUNG DAD WAS THE BEST TIMERay ConnollyReal age: 78. Spirit age: 29.Emotionally frozen at the age of 29, that\u0027s what I was. That\u0027s how I still think of myself.It was the age when I became confident that I knew how to do what I was good at.We bought a big, run-down house on my 29th birthday in 1970 and it felt like a new beginning, setting off on a new adventure with a future rich in hope and possibilities.          Ray Connolly is \u0027frozen at the age of 29\u0027That was also the time when I was a young father. I liked the role of being a dad — I still do. Not the sort of dad who helped much around the house, more the type who saw children as people to amuse and who enjoyed being amused by them.I expect lots of men identify with being in their late teens — which suggests to me they must have had more success with girls at that age than I did. Marrying Plum when I was 25 was the best thing I ever did. We\u0027ve grown old together, but still reckon the years when the children were small were the best.It was hard, of course. Not much money, two children and soon another on the way, redecorating all four floors of our home in the evenings — Wedgwood blue and white panels nearly everywhere.Not everything has turned out as I hoped. There have been some mistakes — like selling that perfect house — and setbacks. But I\u0027m still happily working seven days a week, still getting new ideas and beginning new projects. Still feeling all of 29.WE GRANNIES ARE FULL OF ENERGYLynne FranksReal age: 70. Spirit age: 30.I have been in my early 30s for almost 40 years. Although clearly my body is older, my enthusiasm for new projects and my energy are the same, and my creativity is as full-on.          Lynne Franks has \u0027been in my early 30s for almost 40 years\u0027At 70, I am opening three new businesses, have moved to a new home in Somerset where I\u0027ve never lived before, and am still optimistic about love and romance.I know good health is vital to keeping up my energy and I eat well, take the best natural supplements and stay as physically active as I have time for, with regular boxing sessions, daily dog walks, tennis lessons and dancing.But I think it\u0027s my love of life and excitement for what each day will bring that keep me feeling less than half my biological age.I meet so many women in my work as a coach and mentor who are my age and planning their next career. It\u0027s as if being grandmothers and well past the menopause has given us a new lease of life.Laughter, love, creative ideas, hugs and a belief that we can work together to create a new and better kind of world is what keeps me and my friends spiritually 30.IS IT TIME I FOUND A PROPER JOB?Libby PurvesReal age: 69. Spirit age: 27.If you\u0027re a freelance, your spirit age stays shamefully young. Actors and musicians know the feeling, too, and I suspect a lot of us still unconsciously feel about 27.It\u0027s understandable: you have never been a serious employee, corporate executive or brisk office manager never been eligible for a company pension, sick pay, maternity leave or an unfair-dismissal tribunal. So you roam the landscape as bright-eyed and wary as a weasel.          Libby Purves says freelancing keeps you \u0027shamefully young\u0027You always wonder about the next contract or the next gig, and never mind being busy you remember how the young Roy Hudd, complaining of overwork, was told by a grand, old, end-of-the-pier agent: \u0027Roy, a full date-book is a happy pro!\u0027You rather relish the sense of adventure involved in professional insecurity, wondering who might try to hire you next and if you would match up to their style, or be able to tolerate the management\u0027s notorious attitude problem.Like a twentysomething between boyfriends, you have a giddy sense that something intriguing and wonderful might be just around the corner. And when it isn\u0027t, you learn to laugh it off and scrounge around for anything that\u0027s going.Yet you\u0027re not a callow teenager: by the mid-20s you had learned to accept nasty rejection without falling into a furious depression.At the same time, you have started to know your value and your price and nerve yourself occasionally to say: \u0027No.\u0027But always there\u0027s that roving eye for a new chance, and a faint sense that maybe you ought to be looking for a \u0027proper job\u0027.Even when I had two small children and lived in a Suffolk field, it was impossible not to read the situations vacant column and go into some mad fantasy of retraining as a psychiatric nurse, PE teacher or automotive bodyshop manager.And, shame to say, I still do.Royalty, presidents and \u0027the most famous elevator ride in...Michael Avenatti\u0027s estranged wife says she wishes he would...\u0027She is super smart and has great energy\u0027: Stormy Daniels\u0027...Firing up viewers: Today scores best ratings in two years...Share this article    Roger Alton says his body feels 171My passport says I\u0027m 71, but most of the time my body feels 171.Especially in the morning (come on knees, do your stuff and get out of bed) or the afternoon (try not to snooze with your mouth open), not to mention the evening (have a shower, not a bath, or you\u0027ll never get out). Then there\u0027s the nights (not the bloody loo again).All a bit embarrassing for a chap who still thinks he\u0027s 34 — physically, socially and professionally in the prime of life, with a rich circle of sporting and friendship associates. Eh! Who are you kidding?\u0027Hi guys. Any chance of a game? I heard you were short and I\u0027ve got my kit.\u0027\u0027Actually, it\u0027s OK. But we\u0027d love it if you would make the tea.\u0027I am not alone: Sergio Parisse, veteran captain of the beleaguered Italian rugby team, was asked if he was thinking of retiring before his team played Scotland last weekend.Not really, he said. \u0027In my head I\u0027m still 16.\u0027I know how he feels. Now, if I can only get up and head for bed . . .YES, THERE\u0027S LIFE BEYOND STRICTLYJohn SergeantReal age: 74. Spirit Age: 74.          John Sergeant feels his exact age I get worried when a young person says: \u0027I\u0027m going to go round the world and try to find myself.\u0027This attempt is unlikely to succeed — for we have many selves, from diligent child to grumpy old man, via many other characters on the way.One of my great joys has been being able to take part in a contrasting range of activities, be it Strictly Come Dancing or reporting Parliament and, somehow, making each one my own.To thine own self be true — but I have preferred to be true to mine own selves.My spirit age is highly variable. Sometimes I feel like a teenager, reluctant to get out of bed in the morning. Running up stairs is now a fairly rare pleasure — I am more likely to imagine that my 90th birthday looms.My spirit age also changes as the year progresses. At the moment I have adapted well to being 74.I feel plenty of adventures still lie ahead. But in just over two months I will be 75, and that is a source of unease.I think the best plan is to set my spirit age at 74 until I am ready to take stock."},{"url":null,"title":"Fracking firm claim strict red tape prevents tapping rich reservoir shale gas","story":"    Fracking firm Cuadrilla\u0027s Preston Road fracking site is seen near Blackpool, where they say a \u0027rich reservoir\u0027 of gas is presentThe company has written to its regulator, the Oil and Gas Authority (OGA), to call for a review of the rules.

Cuadrilla had to pause work several times late last year after tremors exceeded the 0.5 limit. The company says it has not been able to complete part of the fracking process – injecting sand after water has been pumped in – without breaching the threshold.Chief executive Francis Egan called for the limit to be raised but did not say where he wants the tremor level to be set.‘All we ask now is that we are treated fairly, with comparable seismic and ground vibration levels to similar industries in Lancashire and elsewhere in the UK,’ he said.          A protester stands outside Cuadrilla\u0027s Preston Road fracking site near BlackpoolThe current limit was imposed after fracking caused minor earthquakes at a different Cuadrilla site in Blackpool in 2011.Dr Brian Baptie and Dr Ben Edwards, advisers to the OGA, have previously said it is safe to treble the magnitude to 1.5 because the risk of harm is ‘vanishingly small’.Earlier this week Sir Jim Ratcliffe, Britain’s richest man and chairman of chemicals firm Ineos, urged regulators to allow earthquakes of up to magnitude 4.0 – said to feel like a large lorry passing by.‘It’s ridiculous we’re not allowed to do the science,’ he said. ‘They’ve just picked stupid levels.

The bulk of the remainder had started implementing plans that had been agreed or were being developed.You can read the minutes of the Bank of England’s meeting, here.We should hear from Bank of England governor Mark Carney in a few minutes.Our economics editor Larry Elliott has been locked in the Bank of England this morning, digesting today’s news. They’ve let him out now, so here’s his take:Minutes of the MPC’s interest rate decision meeting said that over the past three months “key parts of the EU withdrawal process had remained unresolved and uncertainty had intensified.“Businesses had appeared increasingly to be responding to Brexit-related uncertainties, and there were some signs that those uncertainties might also be affecting households’ spending and saving decisions.”The minutes added that consumer confidence, particularly the view households took of the general state of the economy, had weakened significantly.“The economic outlook will continue to depend significantly on the nature of EU withdrawal, in particular: the new trading arrangements between the EU and the UK whether the transition to them is abrupt or smooth and how households, businesses and financial markets respond.”There she goes again....The pound has fallen further against the US dollar, on the back of the Bank of England’s announcement.Sterling is now down over half a cent at $1.2877, a two-week low. Investors are concluding that UK interest rates will remain low for many months to come:The Bank has also flagged up that business investment has been hurt by Brexit uncertainty, even though it’s historically cheap to borrow money to invest.The Bank of England has reiterated that it could cut interest rates, or raise them, after Brexit - depending on how it plays out.That’s because the Bank could (in theory) cut borrowing costs to help the economy, or hike them to protect the pound and fight inflation.It all depends whether Brexit turns into a demand shock (hurting businesses), or a supply shock (in which consumers and firms are fighting over whatever scarce resources make it into the UK).Or, as the Bank puts it:The economic outlook will continue to depend significantly on the nature of EU withdrawal, in particular: the new trading arrangements between the European Union and the United Kingdom whether the transition to them is abrupt or smooth and how households, businesses and financial markets respond.The appropriate path of monetary policy will depend on the balance of these effects on demand, supply and the exchange rate. The monetary policy response to Brexit, whatever form it takes, will not be automatic and could be in either direction.The minutes of the Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee meeting show that it is worried about Brexit, and the wider global economy.On the world economy, the Bank says that the US-China trade war is hurting:The world economy has continued to slow over recent months, with a broad-based softening across all regions. That deceleration reflects the past tightening in global financial conditions, as well as the initial impact of trade tensions on business sentiment.Global growth is expected to dip below trend in coming quarters, weighing on UK net trade, before rising to around potential ratesIt also fears that the UK economy has weakened in recent months:UK economic growth slowed in late 2018 and appears to have weakened further in early 2019. This slowdown mainly reflects softer activity abroad and the greater effects from Brexit uncertainties at home.These uncertainties could lead to greater-than-usual short-term volatility in UK data, which may therefore provide less of a signal about the medium-term outlook. Heightened uncertainty and elevated bank funding costs are assumed to subside over time, as greater clarity on future trading arrangements is assumed to emerge.The Bank of England has also cut its growth forecasts, warning that Britain faced its weakest economic growth in 10 years in 2019.“UK economic growth slowed in late 2018 and appears to have weakened further in early 2019. “This slowdown mainly reflects softer activity abroad and the greater effects from Brexit uncertainties at home.”It’s a unanimous decision - all nine members of the monetary policy committee decided (with Brexit looming) not to move borrowing costs today.More to follow...."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2ba07a288b0ea336fb144bb210ee79844c947324/733_0_3263_1958/master/3263.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a130de45f33a9ac70e95b95b63d7a47b","title":"clear him out palestinian tenants struggle to rent in west jerusalem","story":"In this ided city, an Arabic name can severely limit the ability to find a home – and anti-discrimination laws don’t cover private housingThe new housemate seemed perfect. A young professional from Jerusalem, fluent in multiple languages, he gelled well with the other tenants. After a short sublet, he asked to be officially added to the lease so he could apply for a parking permit.The landlord became angry and refused. The would-be-housemate had a distinctly Arabic name and the landlord said he wouldn’t rent to a Palestinian. In a text message to one of the other housemates, a British-Israeli teacher, the landlord wrote that he didn’t want a “non-Jew” renting and ordered them to “clear him out as soon as possible”. When the housemates pushed back, the landlord threatened to come with his brothers, change the locks and throw them out.“I was shocked,” says the teacher, but their Palestinian would-be housemate wasn’t. He declined to speak on the record or file a complaint. “What do you expect?” the teacher recalled him saying. “This is Jerusalem.”Like many Palestinians, he had experienced suspicion and racism before in Jewish-majority west Jerusalem. Facing discrimination is common for Palestinians trying to rent apartments on the well-maintained west side of the city. Sometimes it’s an upfront “No Arabs” directive from the landlord, but more often it is harder to pinpoint not getting a call back once an Arabic name comes up, for example.A few years back, Lustingman was leaving an apartment in west Jerusalem before the lease ended and needed a replacement. Luckily a friend, a Palestinian doctor, was interested. He had a guarantor and all the paperwork ready.“The landlord would not accept him as a tenant,” Lustingman says. “He wouldn’t allow a Palestinian person to move there … He’d rather the house stay empty.”She offered to represent her friend in a legal battle, which he declined. “He just wanted to find a different place to live.”Of these four Palestinian statuses, two – Palestinian citizens of Israel and east Jerusalem residents – feel the impact of Jerusalem’s housing dynamics.Given this labyrinthine question of status, as well as the history and ongoing violence between Israelis and Palestinians, the two populations are often fearful of mingling. Palestinian suicide bombers in the mid-2000s brought everyday life in west Jerusalem to a halt, and since 2015 there have been waves of Palestinian stabbings. Many Israelis describe Jerusalem as the kind of city where the three main communities – Jewish Israelis, Palestinians, and ultra-religious Jews – prefer to live separately. The Israeli public was elated when US president Donald Trump moved the American Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem in May last year, effectively endorsing Israel’s position that Jerusalem is its unided capital. Palestinians, however, also claim east Jerusalem as the capital of their future state.Amid these political battles, unofficial housing discrimination remains an effective way to keep the population ided as Israel’s right-wing government attempts to extend its dominance over Jerusalem.A number of lawyers and human rights groups contacted say they are not aware of any legal cases contesting this kind of housing discrimination.“It is difficult to prove,” Lustingman adds. “That’s part of the problem. Usually people will see the name and they won’t say directly that this is the reason … There is no direct straightforward test to this.”While Israeli law directly forbids race, gender and other discrimination in areas such as employment and public space, there is no direct prohibition in relation to private housing. There is, however, a basic premise under Israeli law which stipulates that a contract must be negotiated in good faith – and Lustingman says a lawyer could argue housing discrimination violates this.Estate agent Eva Aviad says there are some areas of west Jerusalem, such as the mixed neighbourhood of Abu Tor, where Palestinians would not face problems renting, adding that she has never encountered a landlord refusing to let to an Arab client.“Most of the landlords that I work with are liberal, excuse me for being so frank,” she says. “The trouble is in this country – and especially in Jerusalem, where you really feel the conflict – is it is hard to be a liberal.”Muhammad, 28, a Hebrew-speaking Palestinian raised in the Old City in east Jerusalem, requested that the  only use his first name. He says he has lived in west Jerusalem for several years but for the past few months has been hunting for a new apartment – and is finding it difficult. Ultra-Orthodox Jewish areas of the city are entirely off limits, he says, and he doesn’t want to live on a street where he’s the only Arab.But Muhammad needs to keep living in Jerusalem to maintain his residency. And as a young person looking for freedom, he doesn’t want to live in the Old City – “the bubble,” he calls it – where Israeli paramilitary police patrol, social norms are conservative, and where his family and neighbours can constantly monitor and restrict his lifestyle.So, before Muhammad goes to meet a potential housemate or landlord, he looks them up on Facebook to try to get a sense of their politics. He then holds his breath for the moment when “you feel something change with them” and he’s told there are others looking or the room is already taken.“Bottom line – I’m still looking for an apartment.”Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7e808aa0c857d3f0dcafcaa7c14aea547d060f80/0_69_4550_2730/master/4550.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d0c55ea4b8065bef8f7dd87e1f917a02","title":"arts culture services austerity","story":"Since 2010, £400m has been stripped from these ‘non-essential’ services. It is a short-sighted, dehumanising tragedyAs it emerged Grantham Museum will soon look out on to a bronze statue of Margaret Thatcher, I found myself thinking about the last time I stepped foot in there.Growing up in the town in the 1990s, the local museum was a cheap trip out for my primary school class, a sea of sticky fingers smudging the glass. I still remember the smell – a sort of musty air mixed with a whiff of adventure.For a small market town, Grantham has a big history, producing not only Thatcher but (more favourably) Isaac Newton. As a kid, our museum was a small window into another world, where the past was packed into a space each of us could explore.Then in 2011 Lincolnshire county council ) moved to close Grantham Museum as part of a “cost-saving exercise” for heritage services. More than 80 years after it first opened, the museum was deemed a service modern society could not afford. In the end, local people formed a charity specifically to save it. The museum survives today because of them – a group of 20 volunteers giving their time to keep history open.It’s a state of affairs replicated up and down the country, with museums, libraries and arts festivals increasingly hollowed out by cash-strapped councils. The maths is simple: as years of austerity have left local authorities struggling to cover even their legal duties, such as social care and child protection, a growing number of so-called nonessential services such as art and culture are cut. Research by the County Councils Network (CCN) recently found £400m has been removed from culture and arts budgets since 2010, with some councils at risk of becoming “little more than social care providers”, as they reduce non-care services to the bare legal minimum.By 2025, the Local Government Association says an £8bn funding black hole will “swallow up” popular council amenities. That means closed leisure centres, axed cultural facilities, fewer bus services, and unkempt parks and green spaces. Even lollipop men and women are under threat.This is all on top of existing cuts. One in three parks no longer has any staff on site, with park funding reduced by at least £15m in the past two years. Elsewhere, £30m was stripped from council library spending in England in 2017-18, according to the Chartered Institute for Public Finance and Accountancy. Over that time, 127 libraries closed nationwide, with others only propped up by volunteers.It’s easy to dismiss these sorts of services, but there’s a clear symbolism to an area facing the loss of its green spaces or museum. Just as boarded-up shops eat away at a place’s sense of its own worth, the closure of arts, nature, and cultural programmes entrench a feeling that culture is for “other people”. In an all too familiar story, we find ourselves sleepwalking into a society in which creativity, escapism and fulfilment are increasingly saved for the middle classes or big cities.As with so many of the cuts we’ve seen over the last decade, the short term cost-cutting of cultural services will likely ultimately put a larger strain on the public purse. Cut community programmes and anything from literacy problems to mental illness and isolation shoots up.But more than that, it shows how austerity doesn’t simply reduce the services councils are able to offer, but shrinks the landscape of those who rely on them. Or to put it another way: an ideology based on endless money saving can never understand the value of something. A library is not only a place to store books it’s the place a teenage girl goes to find quiet for her exam revision. An arts programme is not a waste of funds it’s how a young man finds a way to express himself. Local services are worth more than their cost on a spreadsheet.When it comes to the spin of austerity, none have been worse affected than local government: Conservatives in Westminster gutted council spending, knowing that the blame would fall on local authorities. And yet matters of who is to blame for a mess are only useful when determining what needs to be done to clear it up. The answer to that is as unfashionably simple as more money: try as they might, ministers know it is simply not possible to cut this deep and for services not to crumble.The question surrounding it, though, is altogether more complex. Just what is it a modern society expects the state to provide? In the coming years, there needs to be an honest discussion on what role councils are expected to play in their communities, and the level of funding this requires. It would be a small, sad nation that set its expectations so low it decides the highest aim of government is to keep the lights on. There are the services that keep us alive. And then there are those that make life worth living."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5432a911d1ac9d6db2ea7cd263401d0e5e5b0399/0_185_2992_1796/master/2992.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b78bf3c53edf1636daf93687c907b630","title":"green new deal climate change us politics","story":"Franklin Delano Roosevelt sought to redefine freedom in the face of war. The Green New Deal imagines goals for a colorful democracyOne of the biggest challenges of climate politics is that the solutions seem scarier than the problem. We worry that to truly decarbonize, we’d need an authoritarian government or endless austerity. But a big and bold enough Green New Deal could finally make us truly free.The principles that animated the New Deal are often associated with Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s proposed (but never fully enacted) Economic Bill of Rights. These included rights to employment, medical care, housing, education, and social security. Those goals are tragically unrealized for many Americans, and any just version of the Green New Deal must start there. They’re familiar goals for the left, ones we’ve been fighting over for decades. But we also need to rework another New Deal-era statement of principles – FDR’s Four Freedoms.In the twilight hours of 1941, as New Deal progress stalled in the face of white southern resistance to federal power, and the war against Hitler intensified in Europe, FDR sought to describe freedom in new terms. He was struggling to bolster support for his faltering domestic agenda and anticipated foreign one the Four Freedoms were eventually mythologized and sentimentalized in paintings by none other than Norman Rockwell.We’re not trying to reclaim American patriotism or generate support for a coming world war. But the task of reimagining freedom is critical. In 1941, the Four Freedoms idea was a bridge between the New Deal’s unprecedented federal activism, pressed forward by a huge wave of labor and community militancy, and the wartime mobilization that followed, whose speed and scale now inspire the vision of a Green New Deal.The right has claimed the language of freedom for decades. But their vision of freedom as your right as an inidual to do whatever you want – so long as you can pay for it – is a recipe for disaster in the 21st century, when it’s clearer than ever that all our fates are bound up together. Freedom has to mean something more than the capitalist’s freedom to invest or the consumer’s freedom to buy.Here, we modestly upstage FDR with five freedoms that can orient us to an uncertain future.Freedom from fear: FDR called for freedom from fear of military conflict. We’re still working on his call for disarmament – we could start with the US army, the world’s biggest consumer of oil and a purveyor of fear worldwide. We must transform our built environment to grant us freedom from fear of the physical changes that already locked-in global warming will bring: fire and hurricanes, extreme temperatures, sea level rise and storm surges – and freedom from the fear that those dangers will grow exponentially worse. It also means abolishing the social disasters a volatile planet could exacerbate. We need freedom from food scarcity and water shortages, freedom from racist, colonial, and sexual violence, and freedom from militarized borders. Freedom from fear means guaranteed jobs and homes so that we can survive every storm, every relocation, and every reorganization of industry.Freedom from toil: We can’t escape work altogether, and there’s a lot of work we need to do, immediately and in the long term. But work doesn’t need to rule our lives. The great nineteenth-century English socialist William Morris made a distinction between useful work and useless toil: we need the former but should free ourselves from the latter. We can escape the crushing toll of working long hours for low wages to make something that someone else owns. At present, there’s a lot of work that’s worse than useless it’s toil that’s harmful to the people doing it and to the world in which we live. But even useful work should be distributed more widely so that we can all do less of it – and spend more time enjoying its fruits.Freedom to move: We live on a beautiful planet that belongs to everyone we should all be free to move around it. Freedom to move is particularly crucial for those whose homes are being rendered unlivable by rising temperatures and seas. But we should also be free to travel to enjoy our vibrant world’s wonders. Not as quickly as we do now we can’t all fly everywhere at the drop of a hat, and some of us need to fly less often. But it’s the reckless waste of the affluent that must end, not the ordinary person’s occasional pleasure in discovering a new corner of the world. Free public transit is necessary to get around without relying on emissions-spewing cars and airplanes. The freedom to move also means the freedom to pack up and live in another city, region, or country. To cope with inevitable climate displacements, we need solidarity without fences or walls.Freedom from domination: Liberals say the market gives us freedom to choose. But under capitalism, the market is master, determining what we can do and who we can be. Every year or two, we can mark a ballot paper. Every hour of every day the compulsion of the market stamps its will on every aspect of our lives. The left has long sought to end the arbitrary power of the few over the many. We must continue to pursue freedom not only from toil, but from the despotism of the boss, from a viciously enforced racial order, and from the intimate violence of patriarchy. Now, the outrageous power of the few threatens billions with ruin. Domination also names our helplessness in the face of global capitalism. We need to know it’s possible to change our own fate, to be able to imagine the end of capitalism more easily than the end of the world. But we must also let go of old fantasies of achieving freedom by recklessly dominating nature to serve human ends – those dreams have turned into nightmares. We need to live on this planet with other people and species. With innovation, equality, care, and wisdom, we can all have freedom within the realm of ecological necessity.Freedom to live: There is enough on our Earth for people everywhere to have what they need to live well. Reusing, recycling, and – most important – redistributing our abundance will open new vistas. The freedom to live includes freedom from want: plentiful access to the basics, such as food, drink, shelter, healthcare, dental, education, music, art, and green spaces. People are also entitled to the freedom to want: the freedom to enjoy life, to be creative, to produce and delight in communal luxuries, to soak up the public goods we create for everyone’s pleasure, to love those we love, and to find new people to love too. The freedom to live a good life s the shared wonders of knowledge, leisure, and adventure.Enemies of climate action warn of totalitarian dullness, while the fossil industry commits crimes against humanity to maintain the privileges of a few. The point of a Green New Deal is to build the opposite: a colorful democracy for all, to live through sun and storm."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26ca4ebb83908a430230d9ca7ed4f3ad80a672b4/0_540_3707_2224/master/3707.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5c4b8320a7cc3d6a0c3b66cece815733","title":"poundland engagement ring is perfect sold 20000","story":"These days, no one can afford a ‘real’ ring, so what’s wrong about opting for a cheap ‘placeholder’?I can remember exactly where I was (a pub) when I first discovered the economics of wedding and engagement rings, I was that astonished: the groom is supposed to spend three times his monthly salary on the item. The reason it should be so expensive is that the ring has many functions a gesture of such great love it should cost more than a boiler a symbol of inidual wealth becoming irrelevant as two destinies are conjoined and a signal to the rest of the world of the scale of the catch you have just landed. But if it seemed ridiculous in the 90s, it seems even more outlandish now. Savings are so last century.Poundland recently came to the rescue with a £1 “placeholder” ring: the idea is that you choose your real ring together, but this is a myth, like “first-time buyer”. No one can afford a “real” ring, or a separate wedding ring, least of all when they have to get married. The 20,000 “bling rings” Poundland sold, in a week, will be the rings everyone says “I do” to.I got married, for the second time, less than a year ago. Without going into too much detail about how expensive getting orced is, we were skint. My Mr wanted to get a £20 wedding ring from Argos I wanted a secondhand ring for 20 times that. I won’t say it was the first time we argued, or even the first time we argued that day, but it was definitely the first time he gave me that “who even are you?” look. It is true that I do not seem like the sort of person who would make a rash decision for display purposes – unless it were, I don’t know, buying a Darth Vader suit for a dog.But I knew two things: the first is that nobody ever knows what to say to you when you’ve just got married, so they tell you you look pretty, then they ask to see your ring. I don’t think this happens to men, but it sure as hell happens to women. If you have to do that 50 times, then you will basically spend the whole of your special day talking about Argos. You’ll probably get on to the subject of its tiny pens and its awesome distribution network more than once. That’s not to say a ring doesn’t bring potential negative externalities, since it’s hard to make conversation about adornments per se. I had a friend who said, “I can never believe how cheap antique jewellery is”, then sent me an elaborate apology. At that point, I genuinely was offended that anyone would think I could be offended by someone calling my ring cheap.Second, that ring, unavoidably, becomes sentimental. When Snoop Dogg’s Beautiful is playing because you didn’t bring your own CD, when the registrar is asking you to check the certificate for errors, and you’re saying, “Yes, that’s fine, except you’ve misspelled ‘Southwark’, which is weird, as you have it embroidered on your tie”, that’s the ring you’re in. You will never replace that ring. You might buy another ring, but that will be your original ring. And if it oxidises and turns your finger a bit green, it is still your ring.This doesn’t mean a Poundland ring is a bad idea it’s brilliant. You just need to put FAQs on the invitation, with “Poundland” under “Where did you get your beautiful ring?”, so you don’t spend the day talking about the incredible value of its Halloween decorations. Also, buy seven. Because they might be cheap, but they probably won’t be built to last, even as long as the average marriage. Sentimental attachments are transferable between items, so long as they are identical."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/145b9fca05bdc57a7109a6ced031fc836ff7df30/491_818_4717_2830/master/4717.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=10c77e60f30bdc01f4c21e6ce4ba1c92","title":"green new deal alexandria ocasio cortez plan","story":"Blueprint for a carbon-neutral economy has been embraced by prominent Democrats and evokes FDR’s famous legacyAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez is releasing a broad outline of a vision for the Green New Deal, a plan to battle economic and racial injustice while also fighting climate change.The new congresswoman’s blueprint, to be made public today, does not set a date for phasing out fossil fuels. But it does aim to develop a carbon-neutral economy in 10 years, which would require huge strides in reducing the US’s reliance on oil and gas and coal. Specifically, the resolution says it is the duty of the federal government to craft a Green New Deal “to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions”. That includes getting all power from “clean, renewable and zero-emission energy sources”.The document also endorses universal healthcare, a jobs guarantee and free higher education – a huge shift in messaging from nearly a decade ago, when Democrats were advocating for a cap-and-trade system to limit greenhouse gases by allotting industry permits for pollution.Sixty members of the House and nine senators are co-sponsoring the resolution, including several presidential candidates, according to a fact sheet provided by congressional aides. However, any legislation would be dead-on-arrival with Republicans in control of the Senate and the White House, and would be difficult for Democrats to implement even if they controlled government. In supporting documents staffer acknowledge the investment required would be “massive”.The Massachusetts senator Ed Markey is introducing the language with Ocasio-Cortez. Discussions also involved major environment, justice and labor organizations. Backers hope the six-page resolution will push Democrats vying for the White House in 2020 not just to sign on to the general idea but to lay out specific legislative goals.Ocasio-Cortez, a democratic socialist from New York who has been in Congress for just over a month, centered her campaign on climate change and a Green New Deal.But the resolution focuses on the tenets of a progressive policy platform as much as it does on climate change.It is both a framework for a cleaner-energy future and a plan for a large-scale mobilization that would rival in scale and scope the progressive New Deal policies ushered in under President Franklin Delano Roosevelt in response to the Great Depression.One of its goals is “to promote justice and equity by stopping current, preventing future, and repairing historic oppression of indigenous peoples, communities of color, migrant communities, deindustrialized communities, depopulated rural communities, the poor, low-income workers, women, the elderly, the unhoused, people with disabilities, and youth”.The resolution says significant portions of the American population are suffering from declining life expectancy, exposure to pollution, and lacking access to healthy food, healthcare, housing, transportation and education. It spotlights wage stagnation, lacking socieconomic mobility, income inequality, a racial wealth ide, a gender pay gap and weakened bargaining power for workers.The resolution text comes as Donald Trump frequently questions the science that shows humans burning fossil fuels are causing temperatures to rise and exacerbate extreme weather. He did not mention climate change in his annual address to Congress this week, despite increasing warnings from scientists.Democrats in the majority in the House are trying to raise awareness of climate change as an impending crisis, with two committees holding hearings this week and a third to follow next week. But Republican lawmakers remain resistant to any legislation to limit greenhouse gas emissions.Republicans in dual climate change hearings called by House Democrats yesterday attacked the as-yet unwritten Green New Deal, charging that it would be far too expensive and would worsen poverty. Ocasio-Cortez and her supporters say the strategy is designed to do the opposite – to create jobs in a green economy.Meanwhile, Trump’s agencies continue to roll back climate regulations enacted by the Obama administration. And US carbon emissions increased last year, according to analysis by the economic firm Rhodium Group.Ocasio-Cortez elevated the Green New Deal when she joined activists at a protest outside the then minority leader Nancy Pelosi’s office last year. The activists are planning to protest Democratic debates in an effort to ensure the proposal, which was until now largely a liberal rallying cry for action on climate change, is a prominent issue for candidates in 2020.Before the text was released, several presidential candidates had already embraced the notion of a Green New Deal, including senators Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker, and Kirsten Gillibrand. The former San Antonio mayor Julián Castro committed to the plan during his campaign announcement.The Democratic congresswoman Pramila Jayapal, who is the co-chair of the House progressive caucus and a sponsor of the legislation, said the resolution defined the scale and scope of what must be done to combat global warming.“We really need an urgent and comprehensive approach,” said Jayapal.Such legislation has little chance of becoming law as long as Republicans control the Senate and Trump is president. But Jayapal said Democrats would continue to lay the groundwork for a Green New Deal while pushing more incremental legislation.“This is a moment for us to push a comprehensive view of the challenge before us,” she said, “and therefore to offer the solution that we need to address that challenge.”The world has already warmed about 1C since the industrialization in the 19th century and is barreling toward exceeding a 1.5C increase, which climate scientists say will significantly worsen the risks of extreme heat, drought, floods and poverty.Already, the process for drafting the brief documents has outlined the fights ahead, even among progressives who want climate action.A background summary prepared by staffers said the plan “sets a goal to get to net-zero, rather than zero emissions, at the end of this 10-year plan because we aren’t sure that we will be able to fully get rid of, for example, emissions from cows or air travel before then.”But climate justice advocates who represent the communities seeing the worst of environmental damages and pollution already want to quickly phase out all fossil fuels. Many also oppose nuclear power that uses mined uranium but represents a huge portion of the US’s zero-carbon energy.Angela Adrar, the executive director of the Climate Justice Alliance, a coalition of communities dealing with environmental problems, said her group supported the vision of the Green New Deal, even though members were concerned about what they saw as loopholes to allow some fossil fuels use.“The Green New Deal is in the beginning processes. We recognize that it’s being proposed in a very difficult political climate, so while it makes sense to have Beltway consensus on a resolution that might come out really soon, the details is what is really going to make the Green New Deal,” Adrar said.Backers said that even with those differences of opinion, the language released is a significant accomplishment.May Boeve, the executive director of the environmental group 350.org, said in a press release that the “resolution is a massive step forward on the path to making the Green New Deal a reality”.“For too long, we’ve seen legislative action fail to live up to the scale and scope of the climate crisis,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fc94478816bde4925c414ae578b98c0506f60340/0_0_1250_750/master/1250.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6dd3b67f759bc24e1c33682ab76b4dd2","title":"uk worst offender in europe for electronic waste exports report","story":"Electronic waste hazardous due to toxic parts was tracked to developing countriesThe UK is the worst offender in Europe for illegally exporting toxic electronic waste to developing countries, according to a two-year investigation that tracked shipments from 10 European countries.The investigation by the environmental watchdog the Basel Action Network (BAN) put GPS trackers on 314 units of computers, LCD monitors and printers placed in recycling facilities in 10 countries. Researchers mapped what they said was the export of 11 items to Ghana, Nigeria, Pakistan, Tanzania, Thailand and Ukraine. The UK was the top of the list of suspected illegal shipments. Five computers and LCD monitors were shipped to developing countries after they were tracked and placed in council recycling centres across England and Scotland.Ireland, Denmark, Italy, Spain and Germany also exported electronic waste to developing countries in what are suspected to be illegal shipments, the report said.By extrapolating the illegal exports with figures on electronic waste generation throughout Europe, the report estimated that 352,474 metric tonnes of electronic waste was being illegally shipped from the EU to developing countries each year.Jim Puckett, director of BAN, said the illegal shipments perpetuated an EU waste management regime “on the backs of the poor and vulnerable”.“We have discovered a very significant stream of illegal shipments of hazardous consumer electronic scrap to vulnerable populations,” he said.“This flies in the face of EU claims to make continuous efforts to implement a circular economy which can only responsibly exist by eliminating … leakage from the system.”The UK’s shipments went from council recycling facilities to Nigeria, Tanzania and Pakistan.Chris Smith, national intelligence manager for the UK Environment Agency, said: “The Environment Agency takes these matters very seriously with a proactive criminal intelligence led team in place that is dedicated to detecting and preventing illegal waste shipments from England.“However, our challenge is vast. Detecting illegal waste shipments is the ultimate hunt for the needle in a haystack, and this is where partnerships allow us to extend our reach and effectiveness. By providing the Environment Agency with an early insight into their tracker deployment, the Basel Action Network enabled us to quickly and efficiently close down four illegal waste operators who exported the electrical waste containing their trackers.”The report said that due to the lack of proper waste management in the recipient developing countries, including open burning of e-waste, there was likely to be local contamination of crops and threats to humans from the illegal exports.Far more should be done, the study said, to prosecute the robust illegal trade, including working with target countries to stem the toxic tide.Puckett condemned lobbying by the electronics manufacturing industry, which is attempting to create a loophole in the Basel convention to allow broken, low value electronic scrap to flow from Europe on the grounds that it will be “repaired” in developing countries. He urged the EU not to agree to the loophole.“The answer to criminal activity is not legalising that activity but improving the enforcement to ensure the future health of Europe is not dependant on poisoning the rest of the world.”In the last two years the rest of the world has increasingly begun to act against imports of rubbish and waste from Europe. China banned the import of millions of tonnes of plastic waste last year.Thailand – one of the countries to which illegal shipments were found to have been made – acted in June 2018 to stem the flow of e-waste being imported after concerns it was becoming the dumping ground for the world.Other countries have also begun to restrict waste imports from European countries. recently revealed concerns over illegality and fraud in the plastic recycling export industry in the UK as the impact of the import bans created a crisis in UK recycling."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a617c78c096c4884eb21f067e0860fd40a7521c4/0_374_1242_745/master/1242.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=66db1d266c5a7e242260e73f5f9d966a","title":"gucci withdraws jumper blackface balaclava","story":"Italian fashion house lambasted over ‘balaclava’ polo neck with large red lipsGucci has withdrawn a polo neck jumper from its shops after social media users said it resembled blackface.The $890 (£689) “balaclava” knit, part of the autumnwinter 2018 collection, covers the bottom half of the face and has a cutout mouth with large red lips.On Wednesday, Twitter and Instagram users posted pictures of the jumper, with several pointing to the fact it was currently Black History Month in the US.One person tweeted: “Balaclava knit top by Gucci.

He had meddled too much with the script. The studio wanted him gone.Moneyball, a back-office drama about the Oakland A’s manager Billy Beane’s quest to revolutionise baseball analytics, was eventually shepherded – by a substitute director, Bennett Miller – to six Oscar nominations. It was a Hollywood success story. But for Soderbergh it was more evidence that Hollywood was failing: another film made in competition with its studio.The director announced his retirement from film-making a few weeks later. “Movies don’t matter any more,” he said. Directors were being treated like dirt.Almost 10 years later. Another revolution. Soderbergh hasn’t changed, but Hollywood has. High Flying Bird, his third film since his return to feature directing in 2017, lands in a new world. A micro-budget Netflix production shot on a smartphone, it’s a very different sports drama, but another story about an innovator upturning the order for the love of the game.André Holland stars as Ray, a basketball agent whose acquisition of the year’s number one draft pick would be a slam-dunk, if only his player was allowed to play. There’s a lockout between the NBA and the athletes, a dispute over pay that has left new recruits like Ray’s client, Erick (Melvin Gregg), sidelined.Ray, a black man looking after the interests of young black men, has to navigate carefully. But, with the help of a sparky former assistant (Zazie Beetz), he takes on the corporations (personified by an ultra-slimy Kyle MacLachlan) and uses their staleness against them. The digital age offers opportunities the old guard have been too slow to tackle. The lockout covers TV broadcast, so streaming platforms are fair game.It’s here that Netflix sub themselves in and it’s this celebration of the company’s own disruptor status where the film fouls up. A particularly clunky scene has Ray, shoring up his client’s confidence in his scheme by proudly announcing that he’s got meetings lined up at Netflix. It plays like a meta love-in between Ray, Soderbergh and the studio, but Netflix – which spent more than $13bn on original productions last year – is too big to claim outlaw status.Still, High Flying Bird makes risky plays. The bold take on race and sport isn’t – and couldn’t be – Soderbergh’s alone. Instead, the film is passed between the director and the screenwriter, Moonlight playwright Tarell Alvin McCraney. His script zips between sports jargon and scripture, analysis and allegory. One sequence has a character draw parallels between professional sport and slavery, then another character quickly ridicule the same. We’re left with Ray’s mentor as our guide and castigator: “Anyone who refers to the institution of slavery in front of me, particularly in reference to basketball and its players, must say these words: ‘I love God and all of his black people.’” Again, this isn’t your typical studio ballgame.The film – with cinematography by Peter Andrews and editing by Mary Ann Bernard (both Steven Soderbergh aliases) – doesn’t always look beautiful. It has a cold blankness, befitting both the soullessness of its subject matter and – perhaps – its $2m budget. It warms up through short interviews the director has filmed with real-life basketball stars Reggie Johnson, Donovan Mitchell and Karl-Anthony Towns, who talk about making the transition from rookie status to the NBA. Filmed as they look up, above the camera, they talk about mistakes, insecurities, family and home. Suddenly, we see them as Ray sees them: as kids. Super-talented, multimillionaire kids, but kids all the same.In picking at a system until it’s threaded, High Flying Bird is a classic Soderbergh construct. Throughout his career – from Sex, Lies and Videotape to Erin Brockovich to Che to Magic Mike – he’s revelled in telling stories of the inidual chipping away at the status quo. Like them, like Ray and like Moneyball’s Billy Beane, Soderbergh sought an alternative to a system that was doing their passion a disservice. The rules have changed, it’s his game now."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/031079c32ab0548656496a7cb65037c19723ab28/502_108_3158_1896/master/3158.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=349101966560281ca2411ef639af24d2","title":"black sheep guardian film nominated for best short documentary oscar","story":"Ed Perkins’ film about a young black boy’s response to a racist gang after he moves out of London is up for an Academy awardBlack Sheep, a film commissioned by the , has been nominated for best short documentary at the 2019 Oscars.Directed by Ed Perkins, Black Sheep tells the story of Cornelius Walker, a black 11-year-old from London who moves with his family to a housing estate in Essex after the murder of schoolboy Damilola Taylor in 2000.

A Japanese snack company is offering chips that require only a single hand to consume – and you don’t have to touch the chips at all. The Tokyo company Koike-ya is behind One Hand Chips, which come pre-smashed so that you can essentially drink them, according to the Wall Street Journal. Now you can swipe with clean hands, and while the calories pile up, you don’t have to waste valuable energy chewing. As one enthusiast tells the paper: “I can just take it and chug it.”Koike-ya is aware of the significance of its accomplishment, calling One Hand Chips “a new snack style humankind has been waiting for”, the Journal reports. But it’s far from the first company to tailor the dining experience around our phone-centric lifestyles.Nearly a decade ago, TechCrunch reported on the Potato Chip Hand. It’s a plastic stick with pincers on one end, forming a grabber that pleasingly mimics the white gloves favored by Mickey Mouse and Goofy. It emerged just a few years after release of the first iPhone.McDonald’s, meanwhile, has gradually refined its own tools to address the phone-grease conundrum. In 2017, it unveiled the Frork, which is a device to hold and dip French fries. Wooden chip forks are commonplace in the UK, of course – with the life-changing implication that fries can be a meal – but this was different. The beauty of the Frork was how the fries became a part of it, serving as makeshift tines that you could sweep through ketchup. The trouble was loading the holder with fries, which was essentially impossible without touching them, as the writer Tim Carman observed in a series of Washington Post pieces on fry-centric tech.Perhaps that’s why the brilliant minds at McDonald’s rethought the strategy last year. Instead of targeting the fries, they focused on the phone with the Frylus. Your hands might be covered in grease, but the tool allowed you to use your phone without touching it. Had Apple considered this innovation, perhaps the iPhone would have come with one from the start.According to General Mills, makers of Cinnamon Toast Crunch, you shouldn’t have to “choose between eating and posting” selfies, either. The cereal team invented the selfie spoon a few years back, as reported in Time and promoted in this horrifying music video.It’s a selfie stick with a spoon at one end. They are (or were) free – “Our awesome fans love to share their obsession with our cereal on social media so we wanted to show a little love back,” a marketing planner said on the company’s blog – but you do have to cover shipping. SelfieSpoon trumpets the fact that this is “really a thing”. They are sold out, presumably forever, but one is available for $50 on eBay.One-handed eating is not new. Chopsticks predated the Frork by roughly 4,000 years. There are also a number of longstanding snacks well suited to one-handed eating – I personally recommend granola bars. A word of caution, however: you’re probably better off keeping eating and Instagramming separate. Unsurprisingly, researchers have found that using a phone during a meal leads to less enjoyment. Presumably subjects were not using selfie spoons."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/55d51c9019132b10e4e2adab7e051b6d0e5159b6/1723_669_1844_1107/master/1844.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ed48c59064da87249ae2d4f5c9582739","title":"jack harper interview real madrid malaga scotland","story":"The Harpers had been on the road for 21 days when the engine failed 1,786 miles from where the journey began and still more than 100 from their destination, so they just set up home there.

And then Jack arrived – a tale that, told with a grin and a little help from Ryan, unfolds like some 20th-century Spanish nativity scene, as if it was all meant to be.“They used to come on holiday and thought it was a good place to bring up the next set of kids,” Jack explains. “They had me on the way when they came and, about six months later, I was born in the centre of Málaga, right next to the cathedral. My mum still talks about it. They didn’t know where the hospitals were, didn’t speak Spanish and had no way of communicating they were expecting a baby, looking for a hospital, asking everyone, but had no idea what anyone said.

He is, says Marca, a “revelation”, scorer of the goal his coach wants shown at the academy the striker who is leading Málaga, third in the second tier, in their attempted return to La Liga a former Real Madrid forward and not-very-foreign foreigner who is a local hero, an “idol” according to the newspaper whose offices are a goal kick from the ground in the city where he was born.The family no longer have a caravan – “That would be the dream,” Harper says – and they moved to nearby Fuengirola, living on Málaga street. “There’s an Iceland in Málaga. Now and again, when I deserve one, I do like an Irn-Bru,” he smiles, but his diet was mostly Mediterranean, his environment too, and he became as Spanish as British. You can hear it in his accent when he talks Scottish in one language, malagueño in the other. “It was school then football – in Spanish – then a switch in my head when I got home.”Like Ryan, who played for nine Spanish clubs before suffering a knee injury, and younger brother Mac, forced out by back problems, Harper could play, leading him to Madrid at 13 and a meeting with Cristiano Ronaldo. A lesson too. “I took a picture. I was tiny, it’s funny looking at that. I’m a fan – he’s the hardest worker, he was always there, I don’t think I’ve ever seen his car move. If it was easy, everyone would do it. He’s obsessed.”Harper does extra shooting and sessions in a hyperbaric chamber – “like a spaceship” – and at Madrid he progressed, seeing the first team more often. “At 17-18, I trained with them a bit. Maybe the manager wants extra men you play the ones who didn’t get on at the weekend, or you play the centre-back, simulating the striker they’ll be up against. We were workers. You go, play, come back, we weren’t told much. But every year I’d get closer.”Every year people would be more aware too. Harper laughs. “I had Twitter and people messaged me every now and again, going: ‘Are you actually Scottish?’ I got my first call-up at 15. We went to Largs.”There he was different. “The only Scottish people I really speak to are my family, I don’t have friends there, so I didn’t have the patter. Even playing, they’d say words I wasn’t sure about. I felt like they’d observe me a bit more, keep their distance, thinking: ‘He doesn’t even speak English’ or: ‘His attitude won’t be good because he’s from a big club.’ I just wanted to blend in, play for my country. The style was different too.”Perhaps that crystallised at U19 level when the coach, Ricky Sbragia, left Harper out, seeking a more physical, taller team – even though he was already over 6ft. Sbragia said that, while Harper was “exceptionally gifted”, he was a “luxury” who could “float” for Madrid whereas Scotland needed discipline, insisting: “We can’t carry him.” He has since admitted being “at fault”, conceding: “My choice of words was not exactly brilliant.”Amid the fallout, the prospect of Scotland losing Harper to Spain appeared more real. When he is asked what his parents, from Barrhead, would have thought had he ever chosen Spain, his brother Ryan shoots back, laughing: “Adoption!” Harper takes over: “They would have supported me through anything but I’ve always known my dad would have dreamed of one of his kids playing for Scotland. I wasn’t asked and I don’t think you would be you’d just get the call-up and then have a decision to make. But I always thought of playing for Scotland.”Could that dream be close now? “I haven’t had a call, and no one’s asked me for tickets, but I’d like to think they know what I’m doing,” he says. “I think they have to, playing the way I’m playing and the club I’m at.”As scouting trips go, it is a nice one, heading south to the sunshine, but it could have been closer. Harper has only been back in Málaga two years, arriving home via the UK, having been convinced that playing in England would benefit his career, aged 19. He is still convinced even though things did not go as planned. Injury intervened, with internal bleeding on his knee keeping him out for six months and causing him to fail a medical.Instead he moved to Brighton, grateful to have had support through rehabilitation, but limited to just over a dozen games for the U23s. “I didn’t have much time to show what I was worth but it prepared me. Growing up at Madrid, I’d say I have the tiki-taka side, but I still had to man-up and England gave me that. It was a learning curve and more than football, it made me a stronger person.”After six years away, a basement room at his parents’ awaited, aged 20. Harper joined Málaga, leading the B team to promotion as the first team suffered relegation, offering opportunity – handed to him by Juan Muñiz. “I’ll never forget this manager,” he says. “The year you break through in professional football, you need trust. In his first talk with me, he said if managers didn’t give chances to youth teamers, there’d never be any footballers. You have to break through somewhere.”Harper broke through. He has started 17 of 24 games with Málaga, who are only a point behind the leaders, Albacete. The pressure is building and he admits that “fun” might not be the word, aware that in football “a lot of people’s emotions are in play, even more this season because I’m from Málaga, but it’s going well.Just one doubt, then: when he scores, what does he say? “¡Gol!” or “Yes!”? “Erm, tough one … I don’t know. I think my mind doesn’t have a language. But I probably shout “¡Gol!” because that’s what all the fans are shouting.”Gol de Harper, the kid who came in a caravan."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/320612cd436c8ab348b5bb3de43d4add7b2c8b5c/0_0_5200_3121/master/5200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d491a231d996d48af90d96303003e18c","title":"brummies not yam yams and nine other unwritten rules of birmingham","story":"Britain’s ‘second city’ is its own world, with unique customs. Get to know the unspoken lay of the land There’s a whole country outside your window, waiting to be explored. That includes the nation’s second city the crown jewel of jewellery making, and my home: Birmingham.Brummies know that our city can be underestimated (it was once described as “very desolate everywhere” by Queen Victoria), but learn its ways and you too will discover its magic. These 10 unwritten rules will equip even the most insular traveller with the skills to become an honorary Brummie.Remember, Brummies and Yam Yams are differentBrummies are from Birmingham. “Yam Yams” are from Dudley.This fundamental difference is a matter of life of a banishment from the West Midlands. Locals don’t take well to being categorised among those who don’t share their postcode. The DYs and the Bs matter.The accent is supposedly different, but I don’t hear it much. I’d advise you to pretend to acknowledge their differences. Though engaging in a cold war, the Yam Yams and Brummies have shared a unified history from the height of the Industrial Revolution … and a unified aversion to the south. Also, don’t attribute the Industrial Revolution to Manchester. Not if you want to be invited back.When it comes to shopping, no stress allowedNo pushing, no shoving, and no jostling in the shopping areas – that’s not how we do things here. With more than a million residents, the city can feel busy and vibrant, but in our malls – The Mailbox, The Bullring – you won’t find hour-long queues and customers cramped up. It’s all very classy in Birmingham, so much so you can even pause for a snap in front of some art while you shop – that is Laurence Broderick’s iconic bronze bull statue (known as The Bull) outside The Bullring which has been named one of the world’s greatest works of public art.For the best bars, avoid the main dragsKeep away from main roads, otherwise it’s main road prices (who wants to pay £10 for a cocktail?), and what a waste that would be. Birmingham is one of the few cities with an affordable nightlife – the average price of a pint is £2.90 – and some great places to start the night are Suds ‘n’ Duds, a quasi-speakeasy disguised as a launderette, 40 St Pauls, a specialist gin bar, and Jekyll and Hyde, which boasts cocktails inspired by its namesakes’ creativity.Travel by rail to enjoy the best of the city’s nightlifeGetting into Birmingham couldn’t be easier, with London Northwestern Railway running trains to and from London and Liverpool – with stops at major towns and cities including Milton Keynes, Coventry, Wolverhampton and Crewe. The train will drop you at Birmingham New Street, slap-bang in the city centre and the perfect place to start your trip. Don’t battle for parking or against traffic – Birmingham is all about the peace and love – and instead, enjoy a tipple and let the train driver do the work.Do not argue about who birthed rock. It was BirminghamThis is an indisputable fact. You can even walk the road Ozzy Osbourne walked down to get to school. Although, for a music hit that’s a little more creative, visit Nick Drake’s grave in Tanworth-in-Arden or John Bonham’s in Rushock instead.You don’t have to spend a fortune to have a good day outCannon Hill park, Ikon gallery and Birmingham Museum \u0026amp Art Gallery are all must-sees and they’re free to visit, too. There are optional paid extras, such as access to dedicated exhibits, or a ride on the swan boats in Cannon Hill park, but you can have a great day out without breaking the bank.Real Brummies venture outside the cityThere’s plenty to do outside the city centre itself. Spook yourself out at Wychbury obelisk and its accompanying forest, home of the infamous mystery: Who Put Bella in the Wych Elm? You could also check out the Black Country Living Museum, where Peaky Blinders is filmed. And The Red House Glass Cone in Stourbridge is a bittersweet tribute to long-dormant artisanal glass-blowing that the town was famous for in its heyday.Do not miss Soho House (no, not that one)Readers of celebrity magazines might be familiar with London private members’ club, Soho House. But Birmingham’s answer is even better heeled. Soho House is a tranquil Georgian home to refresh your mind and learn something while you’re at it. Along with the standard afternoon tea opportunities that come with stately homes, Soho House hosts talks on the textile industry, women of the Lunar Society and Cafe Scientifique, an informal science debate featuring guest speakers.Watch out on the escalatorsLondoners, are you tired with order confining you to the right-hand side of the escalator? Lucky for you, the West Midlands operates on a free-for-all basis. Want to stand in the middle and have no one attempt to push past you? Want to lean on the left-hand side? Revel in it and stand wherever you want. Want to get past someone? It’s anyone’s game at this point. Godspeed, dear reader.Birmingham has more canals than VeniceSorry, Venice. You might have narrow cobblestone streets and lavish architecture, but we beat your paltry 26 miles of canals by nine, with 35 miles in total. What can you do with these canals, you ask? Well, you can go for a relaxing walk along them or take a canal tour.

The UK’s three major commercial radio networks are investing heavily in new, digital-only outlets in the belief that the proliferation of digital radios and smart speakers such as Amazon’s Echowill encourage people to try new stations.The BBC’s director of radio, James Purnell, has previously said he was not concerned with such metrics and was instead focusing on developing the audience for the much-criticised BBC Sounds app and ensuring its output was relevant to the next generation through increased investment in podcasting and online audio.The period covered by the Rajar figures was shortly before a substantial changeover in the world of radio that saw several high-profile presenters switch stations including Chris Evans to Virgin Radio, Zoe Ball and Sara Cox starting new shows on BBC Radio 2 and Simon Mayo leaving to start a new classical music station.BBC Radio 1 also lost half a million listeners, though the new Greg James breakfast show added 300,000 people to its audience when listeners aged 10 and over were included.Radio 4’s Today programme is now listened to by 6.8 million listeners a week, only a slight dip on the same period last year. On Wednesday John Humphrys confirmed he would be leaving the station after 32 years with the programme.Elsewhere in the commercial radio sector Bauer Media’s Magic network has hit a record high of 4.2 million listeners, while Global’s Heart network is reaching 9.7 million listeners a week.Rupert Murdoch’s Wireless Group, the third-biggest UK commercial radio group, has made a substantial investment in the likes of Virgin Radio and TalkRadio, but listener figures suggest it is still struggling to build an audience.Despite outbidding the BBC for sports rights and hiring Jeremy Kyle, Matthew Wright and Eamonn Holmes, the audience for its national stations has only edged up slightly from a low base and it remains a comparative minnow in the industry.Virgin Radio only attracted 447,000 listeners a week at the end of 2018, a far cry from the 9 million who tuned in to the final months of Evans’s BBC Radio 2 breakfast show. His bosses will be hoping this figure jumps substantially in the coming months, aided by his high-profile arrival, heavy advertising and cross-promotion from the Sun newspaper."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c6e4aa8078e270eed6ebcc250e79a66ebbd91c13/9_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c7d7ed15add82f04864bf077ca173218","title":"aj tracey review londoner british rap debut album","story":"(AJ Tracey)The west Londoner’s lyrics are a blur of Vegas hotels and high-end cars – but laced with witty asides about Lenny Henry If you were searching for an artist who embodies the air of confidence currently surging through the UK rap scene, you could do worse than alight on AJ Tracey. He is, by his own admission, a “cheeky arrogant prick”, who seems to delight in the fact that his rise to fame has put noses out of joint among the elder statesmen of grime. “I’m not here for just trying to emulate what they did and just trying to keep their nostalgia alive – I’m trying to usher in the new era,” he told one interviewer, not long after his self-released single Butterflies went gold last year. It’s a theme he returns to within seconds on his eponymous debut album: “Me and you are not the same,” he assures nameless backbiters, “I’ve got a different past.”Indeed, self-assurance seems to find expression in ways that go beyond standard interview braggadocio. His debut album arrives in a sleeve that features the 24-year-old west Londoner cradling a baby goat. If it isn’t clear exactly what cradling a baby goat has to do with the album’s contents, it’s certainly an effective way of putting some distance between Tracey and his peers in terms of iconography: you can have the bling and the gritty urban landscapes, I’ve got livestock. Following on the heels of an onstage appearance with Jared Leto’s Thirty Seconds to Mars and the announcement that he would like to collaborate with, of all people, pallid teen-poppers the Vamps, a lot of pre-release attention has been attracted not by the album’s guest stars – a great, calm-but-menacing turn from Giggs on Nothing But Net and rising Brooklyn rapper Jay Critch amid the soft-focus, Auto-Tune-heavy Necklace among them – or indeed the inevitable co-sign from Drake, but the fact that among its multifarious styles lurks a track that Tracey has described as “my take on country music”. Even in a scene increasingly untroubled by the kind of generic isions that once defined it, a metaphorical jaunt to Nashville feels like a brave new frontier.As it turns out, to describe Country Star as country music amounts to gilding the lily. It features an acoustic guitar and the lyrics mention both “cowboy spins in the car” and “cowgirls zipping off bras” – this is very much what the role of girls, cow or otherwise, amounts to throughout the album – and there the similarity ends. It’s a rare instance of Tracey writing cheques with his mouth that his music can’t cash. Tracey’s impressively dextrous flow can conceal a slight lack of lyrical content – aside from a solitary mention of hating Nigel Farage, the politicking rapper of the Grenfell marches and the Grime4Corbyn campaign is noticeable by his absence, preferring to stick with the less provocative topic of how successful he is both financially and with the ladies, including, Doing It suggests, some famous ones. But his musical versatility is never in doubt.The album leaps surefootedly from the pop-facing and melodically lush Psych Out! and Butterflies to the claustrophobic rhythmic clatter and 80s arcade game electronics of Horror Flick. Tracey seems as at home essaying a great slice of retro two-step garage – Ladbroke Grove, enriched by a melancholy, helium-voiced hook that butts against the party-starting lyrics – as he is performing over an opening brace of tracks that are sparse and understated but never forget to include a nagging sample: the lovely piano coda of Double Cs, the introspective-sounding guitar figure that punctuates Jackpot. “I feel like a human jukebox with all these melodies,” he crows on Psych Out!, and it’s far from a hollow boast. What his debut album is really good at is hitting a mainstream sweet spot, coming up with music that functions as pop but feels natural and unforced. There’s never any sense of the craven show-me-the-money desperation that marked out the short-lived UK pop-rap explosion of a decade ago.For all the lyrics’ tendency to fly past in a blur of namechecks for designer labels, Vegas hotels and high-end car manufacturers, there’s self-awareness and occasionally very British wit behind them. Henny gets rhymed with Lenny Henry, Prada Me is based around a pun that only works in a London accent, and there’s a nice moment on Horror Flick where he breaks character to assure the listener that, for all the swagger and sex talk, you could take him home to meet your mum: “I’m a cool guy – I’m lovely with parents.” Necklace is audibly inspired by Drake, but Tracey is smart enough to take on his influence while scrupulously avoiding the rapper’s penchant for solipsism and self-pity. Then again, as he would doubtless point out, he currently doesn’t have much reason to feel sorry for himself.International Teachers of Pop: Another Brick In the Wall (The Re-moaner Mix)Better even than the 1980 disco cover by Snatch that completely changed the lyrics – “Yes, you need an education” etc – Pink Floyd’s teacher-admonishing hit recast as icy Teutonic synth-pop."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c72bc2b1b54079364edaa5d064d5edd4dcbc89f9/0_165_2819_1691/master/2819.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d9d139f5331e4fcbd2844ef1e832faa6","title":"thank u next why pop stars fell out of love with albums ariana grande","story":"Chart-toppers used to focus on long-players. Now, in the streaming era, they can release tracks whenever they like – and many, including Ariane Grande, have decided to do just thatWhat’s your favourite Ariana Grande single of the past nine months? Was it April’s No Tears Left to Cry, or July’s ballad God Is a Woman? Maybe it was September’s anti-anxiety anthem, Breathin. Perhaps you weren’t a fan of Sweetener, the album that housed all three, and preferred November’s Thank U, Next, a single from a forthcoming album of the same title released this Friday. That global chart-topper was followed a month later by Imagine, which has now been replaced by 7 Rings.Grande’s more-is-more attitude not only demonstrates how rapidly streaming culture has reshaped the way music is released, but, as she outlined in a recent interview with Billboard, how it liberates her from the music industry’s traditionally long-winded release cycle (“Do the teaser before the single, then do the single, and wait to do the preorder, and radio has to impact before the video, and we have to do the discount on this day”). Instead, she releases music direct to her fans, “in the way that a rapper does”.Grande’s rapid-fire release strategy aligns her with a host of emerging pop artists who pepper streaming services with tracks, collaborations, acoustic covers, EPs and so-called “retail mixtapes” (basically an unofficial album) on an almost weekly basis.Australian pop star Betty Who says it is about circumnavigating the music business “middlemen” rather than seeing which songs connect with fans. “I don’t feel like I’m trying to find what sticks. I get to make the music I want to make and I don’t have to get permission from anybody.”Fellow Australian singer-songwriter Emmi has a more complicated relationship with streaming services. In 2016, Taylor Swift included Emmi’s track Sleep on It on her playlist of new music, and more people started paying attention. “Every artist falls prey to the notion that doing anything is better than doing nothing, particularly when there’s a buzz, and your fans are filling up your DMs with: ‘So what’s next?’” she says. “It’s possible you just release because you feel the pressure to keep people happy.” Still, she’s currently releasing a trilogy of playlists. One, out already, follows a relationship from start to finish another is inspired by Shakespeare. “Much like curated playlists on Spotify and Apple, each one has its own mood, style and concept,” she says.Neither Betty Who nor Emmi are on major labels. But for acts that are, such as Anne-Marie and Dua Lipa, this kind of strategy, where a succession of songs are released until one takes off, and then the album follows, can risk boring fans who were in at the start.For Mabel, another major-label pop artist, the trek to her debut album has been a long one. Since her arrival in 2015, she has released 12 singles, an EP and a mixtape, Ivy to Roses. An album is mooted for this year, close to two years after her biggest hit so far, Finders Keepers, a song that took months to build and ended up spending five weeks in the Top 10. Ivy to Roses, originally released in 2017, has recently been expanded to include her new single, Don’t Call Me Up. It has a lot riding on it after her previous single, One Shot, peaked at No 44. In the world of streaming, however, artists can quickly move on from a flop with tracks used to tide fans over before a hit kickstarts an album campaign.So what of pop’s old guard, used to things called “CDs” being sold in places called “record shops”? “Big pop artists need to re-establish themselves in a modern context,” says Chute. “You might spend years planning a new album only to return to a landscape where you have to give half of that music away pre-release, as it boosts your profile.”Olly Murs, who hasn’t added to his tally of eight UK top 10 singles since streaming data was added to the charts in 2014, released a double album last year featuring one side of new songs and one of greatest hits. Recently, Dido rolled out a campaign involving two “promotional singles” ahead of what then turned out to be the proper lead single, a tactic that might have worked had either of the early tracks taken off. Cheryl, meanwhile, is releasing songs on a track-by-track basis, with no threat of an album as yet her comeback, Love Made Me Do It, peaked at No 19.This shift in the mechanisms of pop is embodied by one of its most interesting practitioners, Charli XCX. Having released two traditional albums, in 2017 she put out two album-length mixtapes. Over the next two years, she released six “proper” singles including the Troye Sivan-assisted 1999. When the latter became a hit, she announced that 2019 was the year she would record a new album, tweeting “about time, right??”. Ultimately, the album remains attractive to artists – it can get you Brit and Grammy nominations and a No 1 position, and can allow you to craft a narrative.Perhaps, then, the future is an overlapping of the traditional and the disruptive. “Artists are just putting out what they want, when they want these days, and calling it whatever they need to,” says Emmi. “I think it’s an exciting time.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f6f84e733526d67ba0ae91daa75d92f76e25032c/0_153_4060_2436/master/4060.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a383a839d61adf38b632ac036a5c4c50","title":"is climate change way worse than we realise today in focus podcast","story":"David Wallace-Wells, the author of new book The Uninhabitable Earth, depicts a world ravaged by climate chaos.

By doing this, they can help avoid the need for costly and time-consuming customs checks during trade between members of the union. Asian shipping containers arriving at Felixstowe or Rotterdam, for example, need only pass through customs once before their contents head to markets all over\u0026nbspEurope. Lorries passing between Dover and Calais avoid delay entirely.Customs are not the only checks that count – imports are also scrutinised for conformity with trading standards regulations and security and immigration purposes – but they do play an important role in determining how much friction there is at the border. A strict customs regime at Dover or between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland would lead to delays that will be costly for business and disruptive for travellers. Just-in-time supply chains in industries such as car making could suffer. An Irish peace process built around the principle of entirely unfettered travel between north and south could be jeopardised.His intervention will dismay backbench Labour MPs and grassroots activists still hoping he will switch the party’s policy towards demanding a second Brexit referendum – which is not mentioned in the letter.And it comes as No 10 prepares to publish legislation underpinning workers’ rights, perhaps as early as next week, in an attempt to win support from Labour backbenchers.In his letter, Corbyn calls for the government to rework the political declaration setting the framework for Britain’s future relationship with the EU – and then enshrine these new negotiating objectives in UK law, so that a future Tory leader could not sweep them away after Brexit.He says the changes to the political declaration must include:There is no mention of the second of the shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer’s six tests, which said that Labour would not support any deal that failed to deliver the “exact same benefits” as single market and customs union membership.Labour’s approach, which Corbyn called “constructive”, appears to be focused firmly on the forward-looking political declaration, rather than the 585-page withdrawal agreement, which contains the Irish backstop and the orce bill.“We recognise that your priority is now to seek legally binding changes to the backstop arrangements contained within the withdrawal agreement, as we discussed when we met,” Corbyn writes.“However, without changes to your negotiating red lines, we do not believe that simply seeking modifications to the existing backstop terms is a credible or sufficient response either to the scale of your defeat last month in parliament, or the need for a deal with the EU that can bring the country together and protect jobs,” he says.He does not explicitly say that article 50 should be extended – a move that the shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, described as “sensible” on Wednesday.But he said that because of the government’s negotiating failures “time has run out for the necessary preparation and for legislation to be finalised”. He added: “Following last week’s rejection by the House of Commons of no deal, all necessary steps must be taken to avoid such an outcome.”He concluded: “My colleagues and I look forward to discussing these proposals with you further, in the constructive manner in which they are intended, with the aim of securing a sensible agreement that can win the support of parliament and bring the country together.”May has so far vehemently resisted the prospect of reopening the political declaration, focusing instead on securing changes to the Irish backstop, which has been the flashpoint for Brexiter Conservative MPs.But at the same time, her government has been trying to win over Labour backbenchers with new legally binding promises on workers’ rights.She could propose a new draft bill as early as next week guaranteeing that UK workers’ rights will keep pace with Europe.Backbench Labour sources said the new bill was in the late stages of drafting and would include a “regression lock” that the UK parliament would ensure workers’ rights would never slip below European standards. That approach appears likely to come close to meeting one of Corbyn’s five tests.Multiple Labour MPs who have met May over the past few months have made it clear to her that they needed the guarantees to be made in primary legislation – because they do not trust that May will remain in No 10 for much longer.Those who are in negotiations with the government have insisted that the bill must be tabled and have had at least one day of second reading within the next few months.The Labour MP John Mann, one of the key figures behind the push for legislation, said: “There needs to be a bill produced soon. We aren’t basing anything on a promise, with all due respect to the prime minister. We are doing it based on statute.”The Labour MP Lisa Nandy, who has also intimated she could back May’s deal, said the right offer from No 10 could win over up to 60 Labour MPs.But Phil Wilson, the Labour MP for Sedgefield and a leading supporter of the People’s Vote campaign, said: “It was perhaps inevitable that at some point my party would publish something like this even though most Labour MPs, members and voters have long since worked out that there is no form of Brexit that can meet the promises made in 2016 or do anything but make people poorer … In the end there is only one way out of this mess for both our country and the Labour party – a people’s vote.”Trade unions are understood to have been pushing for the legislation to include an easing of restrictions on union activity. Union leaders had been seeking more concrete proposals for regulation of the labour market after Brexit and the enforcement of existing law.“Their desire to bring in seasonal agricultural workers from around the globe, as well as barista visas, really does ring alarm bells,” one union source said. “Our fear is that when workers depend on their bosses for their visas, exploitation is sure to follow.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3593181eaf0f4ca8b33eebef16af70cce3a29b66/0_99_3113_1869/master/3113.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=06f396aa66dee1b779cb564b7e993cb0","title":"brexit latest news developments theresa may brussels talks corbyn faces backlash from labour pro europeans after sending brexit plan to pm politics live","story":"Rolling coverage of the day’s political developments as they happen, including Theresa May’s visit to Brussels for Brexit talks with Donald Tusk and Jean-Claude JunckerTurning back to the Jeremy Corbyn letter, the Mirror’s Pippa Crerar has an interesting line.And here is some comment from journalists on the joint MayJuncker statement.From the Sun’s Nick GutteridgeFrom the BBC’s Laura KuenssbergFrom the Express’s Joe BarnesFrom the Times’ Sam CoatesFrom the Sun’s Tom Newton DunnAnd the ’s Peter Foster has a whole Twitter thread on this. It starts here.Theresa May and Jean-Claude Juncker, the European commission president, have issued this joint statement after their talks.Prime Minister May and President Juncker have met today to review the next steps in the UK’s withdrawal from the EU.The talks were held in a spirit of working together to achieve the UK’s orderly withdrawal from the EU, especially in the context of a shared determination to achieve a strong partnership for the future given the global challenges the EU and the UK face together in upholding open and fair trade, cooperation in the fight against climate change and terrorism and defending the rules-based international system.The prime minister described the context in the UK Parliament, and the motivation behind last week’s vote in the House of Commons seeking a legally binding change to the terms of the backstop. She raised various options for dealing with these concerns in the context of the withdrawal agreement in line with her commitments to the Parliament.President Juncker underlined that the EU27 will not reopen the withdrawal agreement, which represents a carefully balanced compromise between the European Union and the UK, in which both sides have made significant concessions to arrive at a deal. President Juncker however expressed his openness to add wording to the political declaration agreed by the EU27 and the UK in order to be more ambitious in terms of content and speed when it comes to the future relationship between the European Union and the UK. President Juncker drew attention to the fact that any solution would have to be agreed by the European parliament and the EU27.The discussion was robust but constructive. Despite the challenges, the two leaders agreed that their teams should hold talks as to whether a way through can be found that would gain the broadest possible support in the UK parliament and respect the guidelines agreed by the European council. The prime minister and the president will meet again before the end of February to take stock of these discussions.Here are the key lines.Downing Street has given its initial response to the Jeremy Corbyn Brexit letter. (See 9.36am.) A spokesperson said:We will reply in due course. Our positions on many of the issues in the letter are well known. Our position on the backstop has not changed.Pressed on the arrangements for next week, Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the Commons, suggested that the debate on Thursday next week would either be on a revised Brexit plan, or else a general Brexit debate on an amendable motion.The government has said repeatedly that it wants a vote on a revised deal as soon as possible and that, if that does not happen by Thursday, there will be a debate anyway on Thursday on Brexit, on amendable motion.Leadsom seemed to be implying that, if Theresa May does get a revised deal next week, the debate and vote on that deal would be on the Thursday.At that point John Bercow, the speaker, intervened to say that, when he saw the draft business for next week last night, it did not include the promised Brexit debate. He said he was alarmed about that, and he said it was very important for the government to honour its promises to MPs about the Brexit vote.Earlier in the Commons Tom Watson, the deputy Labour leader and shadow culture secretary, accused the government of implementing a “Tory triple-whammy tourist tax”. He made the claim as he asked an urgent question about the HuffPost report saying, in the event of a no-deal Brexit, mobile phone roaming charges could return for people visiting Europe under government plans. Watson said:But Watson said that this assurance was not good enough for consumers. He told MPs:Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the Commons, has just announced the business for next week. It does include a debate on Brexit on Thursday.She said the government was still committed to having a “meaningful vote” on a revised deal as soon as possible. If this does not happen by Wednesday next week, Theresa May will make a statement to MPs, followed by the debate on Thursday, Leadsom said.Theresa May encountered an anti-Brexit campaigner when she arrived the the European commission HQ in Brussels, the BBC’s Adam Fleming reports.A senior Labour source says that Matthew Pennycook’s claim that the party will move to backing a second referendum if Theresa May does not accept its Brexit proposals in full (see 10.52am) does not reflect the official leadership position.The Lib Dems, who are campaigning for a second referendum, have criticised Jeremy Corbyn’s Brexit offer to the government. Tom Brake, the party’s Brexit spokesman, said:Jeremy Corbyn has turned his back on the millions of Labour members and voters who demand a better future than Tory Brexit Britain. He has chosen to forget that Labour conference voted for the party to campaign for a people’s vote after failing to secure a general election.After thirty years sitting on the backbenches arguing for more power for members and against the EU, Corbyn has finally chosen to go for the latter at the expense of the former.Matthew Pennycook, a shadow Brexit minister, says that if Theresa May does not accept Labour’s Brexit conditions (see 9.36am) “in full”, the party must move to backing a second referendum.What Pennycook is saying is entirely consistent with the Labour Brexit policy agreed at party conference. But that document was a masterpiece of elasticity, designed to accommodate all opinion within the party ranging from People’s Vote to Corbynite Lexitism.In truth, Pennycook’s message is rather different from Jeremy Corbyn’s. In his letter, Corbyn did not say anything about what Labour might do if May does not accept his proposals and he did not raise the issue of a second referendum at all. Also, whereas Pennycook is saying May must accept Labour’s demands “in full”, the Corbyn letter said any negotiation with the EU would require “flexibility and compromise”.I’ve asked Corbyn’s office if they support what Pennycook is saying. I will post the response when I get it.On the Today programme David Lidington, the Cabinet Office minister and Theresa May’s de facto deputy, said that the government would be happy to talk with Labour further about its Brexit plans. He said that he had not received any “direct overtures” from the party about talks, but that he would be willing to discuss the issue with Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, or Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary.But he also claimed that the Labour proposals (see 9.36am) reflected “wishful thinking”. A key part of any discussion would be “to understand exactly where the Labour frontbench is coming from”, he said. He went on:I would be saying to Labour, ‘What is it that you don’t like about what is in the political declaration at the moment?’, because what we have there is an idea of a customs arrangement with the European Union that still allows us to have an independent trade policy on top of that, but while getting access - tariff-free and quota-free - for our goods and agriculture to the European market.I would be asking what on earth they mean when they say they want to be in a customs union with the EU but also for Britain to have a say in EU trade policy with other countries. That’s not something that’s allowed under the European treaties. This seems to be wishful thinking.Here are three more Labour MPs expressing doubts about Jeremy Corbyn’s Brexit offer to Theresa May.Theresa May has arrived in Brussels. Last night Downing Street sent out a briefing note setting out the key messages that Theresa May will be delivering in Brussels today. For the record, here they are in full.The UK’s objective is to find a way to guarantee we cannot, and will not, be trapped in the backstop.The prime minister is open to different ways to achieve this, but is clear it must be legally binding and therefore will require changes to the withdrawal agreement.Securing such changes will not be easy.The withdrawal agreement was the product of much hard work and was negotiated in good faith.However, parliament voted by a significant majority in the meaningful vote, sending an unequivocal message that change is required.Last week, parliament made clear that for the first time it could support the withdrawal agreement, subject to changes to the backstop. Importantly, MPs also reiterated their absolute commitment to both avoiding a hard border and leaving the EU with a deal.While Labour did not whip for the Brady amendment, Jeremy Corbyn has said he also has concerns about the backstop – so this is an issue that needs to be resolved, not just for our Conservative MPs and the DUP, but for MPs across the House.To achieve this we have launched urgent pieces of work examining alternative arrangements to the backstop and considering legal changes to the current backstop that could provide the type of guarantees MPs from all sides have said they need.The government now wants urgently to work with the EU to secure such changes.The EU shares the UK’s commitment to leave with a deal. We must show determination and do what it takes to now get the deal over the line.The People’s Vote campaign, which wants a second referendum, has released a response to the Corbyn letter from the Labour MP Phil Wilson, one of its supporters. He calls for the Corbyn plan to be scrutinised - so that it can be rejected. He says:It was perhaps inevitable that at some point my party would publish something like this even though most Labour MPs, members and voters have long since worked out that there is no form of Brexit that can meet the promises made in 2016 or do anything but make people poorer.What’s needed now is for this and any other alternative Brexit proposal to be given the same level of scrutiny that led parliament to reject the government’s deal last month. That will show that no number of tweaks to the political declaration pretending we can have our cake and eat it can change the reality that any Brexit deal means leaving the EU without clarity or certainty about where we will end up.Our party conference agreed last year that if it couldn’t get a general election it should explore other options including a new public vote. The party and parliament should examine this option so that if and when it is rejected, Labour can fulfil the wishes of the overwhelming majority of its voters and members by campaigning to give the public the final say. In the end there is only one way out of this mess for both our country and the Labour party - a People’s Vote.Although People’s Vote is calling for the Labour plan to be subject to rigorous scrutiny, in fact a critical analysis has already been published - by the People’s Vote campaign itself. Last month it published a 16-page briefing paper (pdf) highlighting problems with the “Norway plus” plan, with Labour’s plan, and with a no-deal Brexit.(Compared to the usual standard of political attack documents, this one is remarkably good. In recent months the People’s Vote campaign has started devoting more of its time to highlighting the flaws with alternative Brexit plans, on the grounds that people will only back a second referendum when the alternatives have been shown to be unsatisfactory. The campaign is well funded, and the briefing material is produces is currently of a much higher quality than anything journalists get from either the Conservatives or Labour.)Here is an extract from Jeremy Corbyn’s letter to Theresa May, setting out Labour’s five demands for Brexit.Labour has long argued that the government should change its negotiating red lines and seek significant changes to the political declaration to provide clarity on our future relationship and deliver a closer economic relationship with the EU. That would also ensure that any backstop would be far less likely to be invoked.The changes we would need to see include:We believe these negotiating objectives need to be enshrined in law before the UK leaves the EU to provide certainty for businesses and a clear framework for our future relationship.We recognise that any negotiation with the EU will require flexibility and compromise. Our first priority must be a deal that is best for jobs, living standards, our communities, in the context of increased and more equitable investment across all regions and nations of the UK. That approach should guide how alignment with EU regulations is to be maintained in future, as well discussions on dispute resolution, the role of the ECJ, and competition and migration rules.Theresa May is in Brussels today for her first face-to-face talks with EU leaders since her Brexit deal was comprehensively rejected by MPs. As my colleague Heather Stewart reports in a handy scene-setter, May does not have a firm alternative plan to propose, suggesting that her meetings might achieve little.But this morning there is an alternative plan B on the table. As the  reports, Jeremy Corbyn has written to May setting out five changes to the Brexit plan that could lead to Labour MPs backing it in the Commons. Labour used to have six tests for Brexit, which seemed drafted in such a way that the PM’s plan was always bound to fail. These new conditions are different, because they read like the outline of something that could eventually pass the Commons. Indeed, during PMQs yesterday, after listening to May’s pro-European deputy David Lidington and the shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry, Ken Clarke told the House that he got the impression that if the two of them were left in a room together “they would take about five minutes to agree a proposal that would take us smoothly through 29 March into proper negotiations.”Here is the Corbyn letter. And a more readable version of the full text is here.Corbyn’s letter is addressed to the PM. But it will be read closely in Brussels and, as Politico Europe’s Jack Blanchard points out in his London Playbook briefing,it has the potential to change the dynamics around May’s talks. Blanchard says:The PM’s whole message to the EU, remember, is that there’s no way to get the Brexit deal through parliament without reopening the withdrawal agreement and rewriting the backstop. As of today, that is no longer true. Juncker and co. can politely suggest she go back home and cut a deal with the opposition if she wants to get this thing done. One Labour source confirmed last night: “This is as much a letter for the EU as it is for Theresa May.”But Labour pro-Europeans, who were hoping that after failing to trigger a general election through a confidence vote, the party would be campaigning and voting for a second referendum, not offering to facilitate Brexit, have reacted angrily to Corbyn’s move.These are from Chuka Umunna, one of the leading Labour supporters of the People’s Vote campaign.This is from Owen Smith, who challenged Corbyn unsuccessfully for the Labour leadership in 2016, partly fighting on the grounds that Labour should be open to a second referendum.This is from David Lammy.And this is from Chris Leslie, who was shadow chancellor for a short period after the 2015 election.Here is the agenda for the day.9.30am: Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, takes questions in the Commons.9.30am: Liz Truss, the chief secretary to the Treasury, and Nick Timothy, Theresa May’s former chief of staff, take part in a debate on the future of the Conservative party at the Resolution Foundation.10am (UK time): Theresa May meets Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European commission, in Brussels. At 1pm she will meet Antonio Tajani, president of the European parliament, and Guy Verhofstadt, the parliment’s lead Brexit spokesman. And at 2pm she will meet Donald Tusk, the president of the European council.10.30am: Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the Commons, makes a Commons statement about next week’s Commons business.As usual, I will also be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web, but I expect to be focusing mostly on Brexit.

Three writers log their health and fitness weeks – from swimming to meditation – as they embark on a journey to wellnessIt’s been my ambition to do the splits since I was a teenager. My last attempt, at a Christmas party, didn’t end well. I had to be physically carried off like a sack of potatoes and left in a darkened room with nothing but deep regret and a bag of frozen peas for company.I can’t do that again, so either I have to stop showing off or I’d better get more flexible, and, if we’re being completely honest, the second one is easier. Given the number of women doing the splits up a mountain on Instagram while talking about their #yogajourney, I figure yoga is the place to start. My week begins with some deep ing into YouTube and I discover Yoga with Adriene. She’s funny, a good teacher and – best of all – she doesn’t speak with a wispy, breathy voice.Next, I buy a 30-day unlimited class pass from my local yoga studio. This allows me to try lots of different classes throughout the week, ranging from an absolute beginner’s introductory session and a slow-paced and gentle yin class to a more dynamic vinyasa flow class. Four days in, I even pluck up the courage to try a hot yoga class, where I entirely underestimate how hot and crowded the room will actually be.I tell one of my teachers that I want to be able to do the splits between two moving trucks like Jean-Claude van Damme and she laughs in my face. But I remain undeterred. I’ve even downloaded an app called 1 Second Everyday that nudges me to record a daily video. The app then stitches the footage together so I can see my progress. (It mainly reveals how I’ve pretty much been wearing the same workout gear day in, day out).One week in, I’m not even close to my splits ambition, but that’s OK. It’s nice to get into a routine – even if it’s just 10 minutes of yoga first thing in the morning or last thing at night or, better still, the odd yoga class during my lunch break. Plus, everything they say about yoga boosting your energy is, unfortunately, completely true. I’m sleeping better and crashing less at work. And I think I might be becoming unbearably smug. Guys, hold on tight, I’m on my #yogajourney.Meditation has always been one of those things that I have mentally filed away in a box marked “Sounds Nice But Not For Me”. Yes, I would theoretically love to experience its purported calming and energy-boosting benefits, to briefly hit pause on the frantic whirl of work and social obligations and the corralling of two young kids. But I could never justify it to myself. Gifted with a free hour I will happily head off on a long, mind-unknotting run, play tennis or even, creaky 35-year-old knees be damned, hop on a skateboard. But, just, sitting there? Doing nothing? Ridiculously wasteful.So, it’s fair to say that I approached a week of guided meditation with a degree of apprehension. And my first day – firing up a newly downloaded mindfulness app at the start of an overwhelmingly busy seven days – is only a partial success. I perch on the edge of the bed mid-morning, shut my eyes, follow the soothing instructions and try to focus on my breath. But my mind keeps snagging on all the things I’m meant to be doing andor pondering how much voiceover actors get paid to do a mindfulness app.But then, on day two, something clicks. I open my eyes after a three-minute session (which I’ve now made part of my pre-shower morning routine) and I feel transformed. Rested. Calm. Vaguely atingle and utterly blissed-out. It is as if my mind has been on a micro-spa break. My pile of tasks is still there but, somehow, it doesn’t feel as insurmountable. And it occurs to me that, in contrast to the somewhat stressful logistics that precede a game of tennis or even a run, this is a quick, easy emotional battery charge I can always fit into my day. All that and the prospect of fewer embarrassingly acquired skateboarding injuries. I feel calmer already.There’s something about the prospect of gliding through water that elicits a child-like glee in me, but as I emerge from the changing rooms and glimpse the intense blue of the pool, my excitement is replaced by a creeping anxiety. I haven’t swum in a long time. I’m not a beginner by any means – I reached level 6 in my school days – but despite the pool being quiet, I feel intimidated. After a couple of deep breaths I lower my body into the shallow end of the pool and tread water for 10 minutes, but I can’t quite muster up the confidence to swim. I leave.On my second visit, the pool is busier and just before I get in I see a swimmer doing a beautiful butterfly stroke – I used to able to do that quite effortlessly too. I linger by the changing room doors until the swimmer has gone. Once they leave, and before a new set of people appear, I decide this time I just need to go for it – I haven’t come all this way to just tread water again! I submerge my body into the pool, and propel myself forward with a kick, alternating my arms. My anxiety evaporates, my body acclimatises to the lukewarm water and my muscles relax. I lose my balance slightly, but I persevere. I manage a few, somewhat scrappy but determined strokes to get to the other side of the pool and then come up for air – I haven’t felt this energised for as long as I can remember.Later that week, I return and my confidence grows even more. Swimming in my own lane feels good. But I’m beginning to realise that carving out this time in my week is giving me so much more: space to reflect on the whirlwind few months I’ve had since publishing Slay in Your Lane, and time to reflect on my next move as a writer.

While being told to discuss the possible misuse of images, words and videos online with their children, the recommendations ask adults to curb their own oversharing.“Parents and carers should never assume that children are happy for their photos to be shared,” the recommendations said. “For everyone – when in doubt, don’t upload!”The guidelines come days after a report by the Commons science and technology select committee flagged a lack of high-quality research into the effects of screen time on young people, including studies that explored the impact of particular uses of screens.A commentary by the chief medical officers that accompanies the guidelines also stressed that more research was needed.However, the officers said immediate action to safeguard young people is necessary by the government, social media platforms and technology companies. Among their suggestions are that the latter sign up to a voluntary code of conduct to protect children online, before the possible introduction of new laws.Further recommendations echo those of the committee, including calls for tech companies to share anonymised data to aid research. The officers also said those who sell technology should make sure consumers are aware of child security features and shown how to use them.Andy Burrows, the associate head of child safety online at the NSPCC, agreed urgent action is necessary.“For over a decade, tech giants have failed to protect their young users, and we can’t waste any more time waiting for them to clean up their act,” he said.“We urge the government to legislate without delay, to make social networks accountable and punish them if they fail to keep children safe.”Dr Bob Patton, a lecturer in clinical psychology at the University of Surrey, said it is impossible at present to break screen time down into “good” and “bad”, since it is highly dependent on content and context.“Idly flicking through a social media site is not the same as doing research for a project or homework – clearly those are very different activities – but at the moment, they have all got lumped together into a general ‘how much time do you spend on the screen’,” he said.The advice for parents and carers includes:"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/24a994391f29b2e7afeeb84277ee5616b49c921b/1232_1139_4768_2861/master/4768.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f19e7a5c29f5f444060c0214652be0d9","title":"control life alexa role public service chatbots councils","story":"Councils, the police and Whitehall are using virtual assistants for new tasks, from supporting disabled people to queries about school menus Every few hours, Alexa, Amazon’s voice-activated virtual assistant, helps Scott Walker stay well. Walker’s cerebral palsy means he has poor coordination and movement, but since last spring Alexa has reminded him to take his medication, as well as automating other tasks around his home.Previously, Walker, who works at Next, used light from his television to get into bed, but can now turn the room lights on and off with his voice. “I haven’t fallen since I’ve had this machine,” he says. “It’s feeling you are in control of your life. My father doesn’t have to worry I am taking my pills at the right time.”An estimated five million UK households have a device that runs either Alexa or Google’s equivalent, according to the research firm Enders Analysis. While most people use chatbots – software that recognises spoken or written natural language and responds in kind – to play music or get answers to questions, there’s increasing interest in people using them to take greater control of their lives. “It could stop a partner becoming a carer,” Walker points out. Walker’s speaker, provided as part of a pilot run by Hampshire county council for 50 recipients of adult social care, does not replace regular visits from care workers to help with physical movement, but means he can do more for himself. Many social care visits are brief calls to check on whether, for instance, someone has taken their pills. If chatbots can replace some of these shorter visits, it could mean care workers being able to spend longer on more useful visits.Graham Allen, Hampshire’s director of adult health and care, says almost three quarters of those in the pilot felt the device helped improve their lives and almost as many felt it had improved their independence, with numbers fairly consistent across different ages. “It’s not a cure-all,” he says. “It needs to be used along with other measures.” But he can see potential for many care service users living at home, and the county’s children’s social services department has just started issuing similar devices.A number of public sector organisations have introduced chatbots, so far mainly to provide information and enable people to report problems. The politan police  is reported to be developing ways for people to report crime via voice-activated systems. School menus in Hampshire are all  online and Amazon’s Alexa can answer questions about them. from parents and children. The Cabinet Office’s government digital service has taken a similar approach with the gov.uk website, so voice-activated speakers can get answers to detailed questions on, for example, the minimum wage for 17-year-olds.Some organisations have gone further. In June 2017, Transport for London launched a text chatbot that uses Facebook Messenger. “It’s useful for people, particularly in their early 20s and 30s, who are more used to the conversational style of messaging platforms,” says Ben Gammon, head of digital services.The TfL chatbot helped more than 29,800 users with travel queries in the last three months of 2018, is available all the time and provides up-to-date, consistent information, says Gammon. “Customers who have simple questions can get an answer while on the go more easily rather than having to search online or call our customer services line.”Aylesbury Vale district council, which runs both text and voice-based chatbot services to deal with a wide range of queries, uses staff to check most queries and, if necessary, edit software-generated responses. The software does provide automatic answers for a handful of the most common queries, but a member of staff still monitors this work and responses are marked as being from an automated system. “ It is important to be transparent,” says Maryvonne Hassall, the council’s digital strategy manager. Last spring, the London borough of Waltham Forest introduced its Walt environmental reporting chatbot, accessible through Messenger and direct messages to a Twitter account @WFTellWalt. It accepts reports on problems such as fly-tipping by asking a short series of questions, with smartphone users able to pass on their locations and pictures of problems. Reports are passed on to the council’s contractors, and people are notified when a problem is solved – something the council says users appreciate. But building chatbot services is expensive for councils, particularly as they are unlikely to be used as much as other channels: three fifths of reports in Waltham Forest come from a standard website form, for instance, with only one fifth arriving through Facebook and Twitter and the rest by phone.Rocco Labellarte, Oxford city council’s chief technology and information officer, says building chatbots is not something councils can do on their own. The city is leading a group of 12 English councils with central government funding to collaborate on developing text and voice chatbots. When Oxford explored voice services, it realised it could afford to build only a couple – a drop in the ocean compared with the hundreds of services most councils provide. If the collaboration’s initial assessment phase justifies further funding, the group hopes to develop text and voice chat services for adoption by more councils. Labellarte led the introduction of the Amelia chatbot service at the London borough of Enfield, which handles queries and requests for permits and authenticates licences. He says that, despite initial set-up costs, chatbots will save councils money by automating the task of answering queries. Labellarte says this could enable people to move to more complex work, where demand is increasing, but there are fears that automation could lead to staff losses and Mariarosaria Taddeo, research fellow at Oxford University’s internet institute and deputy director of its digital ethics lab, believes public services need to exercise care when introducing chatbots. This includes making it clear when bots are in use: “It’s important that users realise there is a machine on the other side,” she says. It also means ensuring automated systems are fair. Many chatbot systems rely on machine learning and there is growing concern about built-in bias. Automated systems can make organisations more efficient – but they must be supervised by real people, says Taddeo.  In Aylesbury Vale, Hassall says chatbots can provide a better service when it comes to factual questions, because they give a consistent response. But she adds that real people should continue to deal with complex queries and anything that requires compassion, such as the result of medical tests. “You need people to engage with people.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/83c0013f70c80a38a9cea699b656cf7508c3c162/0_0_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e47595ec602f5f26c3ea1cb706549ee7","title":"british skier james woods wins first world title slopestyle","story":"Great Britain’s James Woods has been crowned world champion for the first time after winning the men’s ski slopestyle competition in Utah.The 27-year-old defied difficult weather conditions to edge out Norwegian teenager Birk Ruud and US double Olympic medallist Nick Goepper.Woods said: “It feels good.

A George North-inspired Wales handed Italy’s bottoms to them in a 61-20 hammering, taking top spot in the standings, but if Ireland could beat Scotland by 21 points they would usurp the Welsh. They did so with room to spare, running out 40-10 winners at Murrayfield and thus meaning England needed a 26-point victory over France. They gave it a fair dig, ultimately ‘only’ winning 55-35 and the Irish took the title. Still, 221 points over three matches isn’t bad.4) The New England Patriots won what has been widely regarded as one of the worst Super Bowls of all time last week – at 13-3, it was certainly the lowest scoring. However, the 2000 edition – enticingly billed as a clash of the two best defenses in the game – between the Baltimore Ravens and the New York Giants is in with a shout, while a thumping is never particularly edifying so the San Francisco 49ers’ 55-10 blowout against the Denver Broncos wasn’t a great watch. Then there was the previous low point for, erm, points, when Washington kept things tight by beating the Miami Dolphins 14-7 in 1973.5) Great Britain are playing in the Federation Cup this week: they’ve never won, but here’s the closest they came in 1981, one of four times they were runners-up, when Chris Evert beat Sue Barker.

The results are intriguing. Aletta Collins’ Blue Moon, set to composer David Sawer’s April\\March, has the closest relationship to the score. The seven women match the careful propositions of the music with careful poses or take light flight across a flute motif. There’s a refreshing sparseness about what’s on stage, and – unusual this – the dancers look like they’re having a really nice time.Based On “a” True Story demonstrates the singular voice of Royal Ballet dancer Kristen McNally. Taking her lead from Samantha Fernando’s music, a piece with a thrillerish edge, the mood is unsettling, a place where a hand curls ominously around a neck before a stage blackout. The pair of pale-faced dancers seem like outsiders, locked together, and the possibility of violence lingers. There’s more unsettling territory in Alexander Whitley’s Uncanny Valley, set to Mica Levi, pondering the dislocation between technology and humanity (I know, big question for a short dance). It’s all uncannily not-quite-right: five dancers just out of sync their gait awkward in a way that’s hard to pin down – it’s the pinched, stressed shoulders – meaning they and we can never relax into the rich toffee-pull texture of Whitley’s choreography. Lots to chew on.Less successful are two duets: a puppet master pas de deux by Goyo Montero, and one by Juliano Nuñes that feels like a lot of hard work for little reward.The most surprising debut is from Calvin Richardson, a 24-year-old Royal Ballet soloist who boldly throws together a lucky dip of styles in Something Borrowed: vogue, street, catwalk strut, gymnastic ballet and even Irish steps. Set to Anna Meredith’s clubby score, with fringed costumes that make the dancers look like human piñatas, it’s clearly an early work (and the young cast look way too polite in the less classical sections) but it’s confident, fun, and I can’t wait to see what Richardson does next. This is exactly the kind of talent that should be nurtured and showcased on this stage."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bcd236261988ef9dd5fd3df6aa573963ec18b78d/0_375_5624_3374/master/5624.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=59d4221c3bad464fd5b1d450e0774731","title":"pinter seven review dumb waiter danny dyer martin freeman a slight ache jamie lloyd","story":"Harold Pinter theatre, LondonDyer and Freeman excel as gunmen in The Dumb Waiter and Jamie Lloyd’s staging of A Slight Ache, with John Heffernan and Gemma Whelan, is a revelationThe season of Harold Pinter’s one-act plays comes to a glorious climax with two of his earliest pieces. The pairing of Danny Dyer and Martin Freeman in The Dumb Waiter (1957) guarantees a pre-sold hit. But it is Jamie Lloyd’s production of a lesser-known radio play, A Slight Ache (1959), with John Heffernan and Gemma Whelan from Game of Thrones, that provides a genuine shock and surprise.The Dumb Waiter is a classic study of two gunmen nervously awaiting instructions in the bleak basement of a Birmingham restaurant. It owes much to Hemingway’s The Killers and anticipates Martin McDonagh’s movie In Bruges. At the same time, it combines the staccato rhythms of music-hall cross-talk with a political study of power and victimisation. Gus, an anxious hitman, asks endless questions while the senior partner, Ben, obeys orders. In Lloyd’s production, even the dumb waiter comes crashing down with the force of a guillotine.But the play is also a joy for actors. Past pairings have included Lee Evans and Jason Isaacs, and Kenneth Cranham and Colin Blakely. The current duo are a match for their predecessors. Freeman avoids the temptation to make the fretful Gus overtly comic: instead he gives us a dapper organisation man, aware that something is not quite right. Dyer, with his looming physique, is the perfect epitome of fake assurance as he rubs his sweaty palms on his thighs. The beauty of this production is that it shows both men are aware that they are part of a hierarchy of terror.If A Slight Ache comes as more of a revelation, it is because of Lloyd’s radical staging. He openly acknowledges this is a radio play and has Heffernan and Whelan initially sitting at microphones as they play a comfortably middle-class couple, Edward and Flora, having a mild spat over the breakfast table. But the action hinges on the intrusion into their lives of an old match-seller who exposes the precariousness not just of their marriage but of their whole existence.On stage, the match-seller is normally a visible presence: sweaty, decrepit and balaclava-helmeted. Lloyd, however, follows the conventions of radio drama and leaves him to our imaginations. As a result, it becomes a play about two people projecting their deepest fears and desires on to a fantasy figure. Heffernan’s Edward moves from a breezily comic attempt to co-opt the unseen match-seller into his own world (“I was in commerce too”) into revelations of panic and insecurity. Whelan is equally remarkable. She adopts a cut-class accent that gradually yields to a disclosure of her unfulfilled longings: when she urges the match-seller, “Speak to me of love”, it is in the breathily urgent tone of a woman who, you infer, has long been denied the joys of sex.These two plays conclude a season that has itself been full of discoveries. It has reminded us that Pinter, while experimenting with form, had a unified imagination. It has also demolished the myth that one-act plays, like short stories, are an inferior form. In Pinter’s hands they are as richly fulfilling as many an inordinate three-hour epic."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a430250ba6c0bcde7ba5c22baf40e72487e007b1/0_0_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e997d2d2a8435cc547a284f0ff410055","title":"five things every aspiring vegan should have in their kitchen","story":"From flax seeds to coconut oil, these ingredients will make your vegan diet easy and deliciousIt’s a common misconception that being vegan is both tricky and dull. The truth is, there are simple food switches we can make to eat fewer animal products, and with the likes of Ben \u0026amp Jerry’s introducing non-dairy versions of some of its most popular flavours, being vegan is now easier than ever.Here are five simple store cupboard updates that will help you be a little more vegan …Flax seedsThe sheer number of things you can use flax seeds for is, quite frankly, mind-boggling.First off, flax eggs. One tablespoon of ground flax seeds mixed with 2-3 tablespoons of warm water becomes a mixture that has the same texture and volume as egg white. You can use these flax eggs in place of chicken’s eggs when binding bakes or adding body to things such as pancakes.Ground flax seeds are also a powerful thickening agent for everything from porridge oats to pasta sauces. Adding a subtle nutty taste and a slightly crunchy texture, they work best with deep flavours such as curries.What makes flax seeds even more essential for vegans is that they contain omega-3, the same kind of good fats you get from oily fish. These oils are essential for optimal brain function, blood flow and can even help reduce the risk of heart disease, so if you’re not getting enough flax seeds in your diet, now’s a great time to start.Keep them whole, boil them with some water and you can even make your own glue or hair gel with them – check out the videos online if you don’t believe us.A word of warning: once ground, flax seeds start to lose their beneficial properties over time, so if you buy them whole, grind them up in a smoothie maker and store them in the fridge. That way, you’ll get the most from these mighty, mini seeds.ChickpeasWhen we say chickpeas, you probably think hummus, and rightly so. Hummus has become a firm favourite in the UK over the past decade, enhancing mealtimes as a condiment and serving up a time-saving savoury snack when combined with veggies or pitta bread.If you have a blender and have never made hummus, you’re missing a trick. It’s a whizz – just blitz a can of chickpeas with a tablespoon or two of tahini, olive oil, lemon juice and salt, then add a teaspoon of water at a time until it all turns into that wonderfully familiar, rich, pale, hummusy-textured gloop.Chickpeas aren’t just tasty, though – they’re an excellent source of complex carbs and fibre.And whatever you do with your can of chickpeas, don’t throw away the water. Known as aquafaba, this juice is rich in starch and is a great egg replacement for making meringues or macarons.Pasta sauceWe’re all busy people, and having a staple, cost-effective “meal in minutes” recipe can be the difference between success and failure when embarking on a new diet. What’s handy is that vegan quick fixes can be pretty similar to non-vegan ones, with a piping hot, saucy bowl of pasta being up there with the best of them.Other than puttanesca, which contains anchovies, most jars of tomato-based pasta sauces are free of animal product.Nutritional yeastThe name might make you think of baking and bread, but unlike traditional yeast, nutritional yeast is deactivated, so it doesn’t rise when warmed and wet. It has a distinctly nutty, cheesy taste and looks a lot like fish food flakes.An insider vegan secret for a long time, these tart, deep and earthy-tasting flakes can be sprinkled over pasta as a parmesan replacement, combined with probiotics, ground cashews and agar-agar – a vegan gelatine substitute – to make vegan cheese. They’re also excellent in a crumb coating when whizzed up with some flax seeds.Coconut oilIn a world with no dairy, coconut oil reigns supreme as the most indulgent alternative around. Combined with almond butter and some agave, it’s a sweet, satisfying snack. Melted and ready to get sizzly, it’s the base flavour for the richest stir-fries and curries. And if you’re using cold-pressed coconut oil in baking, it adds a creamy, subtly tropical aroma and taste to everything from brownies to cookies.Melting at around 24C (76F), it tends to stay solid at room temperature in most climates, and in a similar way to cocoa butter, becomes liquid when melted in our hands or mouth.In addition, cold-pressed oil – the pricier variety – can raise levels of good cholesterol. Meanwhile, the cheaper, standard coconut oil carries no coconut flavour, so is an excellent, versatile fat for cooking coconut flavour-free dishes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e716abc367f653c36a1afe0528d3dce1420cf188/0_117_2350_1410/master/2350.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=86a86670b2e36f1e16102e411cb9fcf2","title":"disability campaigners give to new emojis for 2019","story":"Guide dogs, prosthetics and accessibility emojis welcomed by rights groupsFrom falafels to mischievous sloths, dozens of new emojis will bring greater ersity to messaging applications this year, as the organisation behind the symbols responds to a number of campaigns.The introduction of image-based characters such as hearing aids, wheelchairs, prosthetic limbs and guide dogs will help redress the underrepresentation of disabled people on the emoji keyboard, while there will also be a wider range of mixed-gender and ethnicity couples for users to choose from.Disability rights campaigners welcomed the new accessibility-themed icons. “Love them or hate them – emojis have become part of our everyday digital lives,” said Phil Talbot, the head of communications at disability equality charity Scope. “Social media is hugely influential and it’s great to see these new disability-inclusive emojis. Up to now disability has been greatly underrepresented.”Following a campaign by a girls’ rights charity to introduce a period-themed emoji, a new ‘drop of blood’ icon is also being introduced.“The inclusion of an emoji which can express what 800 million women around the world are experiencing every month is a huge step towards normalising periods and smashing the stigma which surrounds them,” said Lucy Russell, the head of girls’ rights and youth at Plan International UK. “An emoji isn’t going to solve this, but it can help change the conversation. Ending the shame around periods begins with talking about it.”Spanning a number of other items that were previously omitted, the 59 newly approved images are expected to be released in the second half of 2019.The perceived ambiguity of one of the new emojis sparked a debate on social media. It is believed that a pinching hand gesture reported to indicate a person’s penis size could be useful for rebuffing “unsolicited dick pics”.Yawning faces, raccoons, a pot containing the South American drink maté, and waffles were among other new emojis that are potentially less open to interpretation.Last year, the highly anticipated addition of emojis depicting cartoon people with ginger hair dominated the headlines, following the annual series of additions from the Unicode Consortium, the body which maintains and regulates the library of characters."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/538d43627198d0539941584f404163bbe4bd630b/0_0_4446_2668/master/4446.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7a7f448a8e7af7ce27175bfcbc4c949b","title":"back up bookmarks google","story":"Jenifer wants a backup while EC wants a replacement for Google+, which is shutting downI have a lot of bookmarked sites for medieval manuscripts on my laptop, which it took a long time to collect. How can I back them up in case the laptop dies? JeniferAs you know, Google is closing Google+ in April. I currently use the site as my online bookmarking tool. Can you suggest something that is easy to use both online and on mobile? ECFirst things first, Jenifer. You should have a backup of your whole hard drive in case your laptop dies. Your operating system almost certainly includes usable backup software. Otherwise, there are more than 30 free third-party alternatives for Windows including BackUp Maker, AOMEI Backupper Standard and EaseUS Todo Backup Free.Fortunately, almost all browsers let you save bookmarks into a single file in the web’s HTML format. Double-clicking this file will load it in a tab in your default browser, where you will be able to click the links to your heart’s content. In fact, some people find that having their bookmarks as a local webpage is handier than folders of bookmarks. The drawback? The saved document isn’t updated when you add a new bookmark.In a well-designed browser such as Vivaldi, you can go to the File menu and simply select “Export Bookmarks …” to create a backup file. Opera is almost as good – you select Bookmarks then “Export Bookmarks …” – but most browsers now make it more complicated.In Firefox, for example, you have to use the obscure Library button, or press Ctrl-Shift-B (for Bookmarks), then click the drop-down menu item for “Import and Backup”. In Google Chrome, you can press Ctrl-Shift-O (for Obscure, I assume) to load the bookmark manager or, like me, type chrome:bookmarks in the address bar and hit enter. After that, click the three dots in the blue Bookmarks bar and select “Export bookmarks”.In Microsoft Edge, click the three dots for Settings, or press Alt-X, then the “Import from another browser” button. The export routine has been cunningly hidden behind the import routine.Once you have saved a file called Vivaldi_Bookmarks-20190207.html or something similar, you can stow it somewhere safe. The options include an external hard drive, a USB memory stick, an SD card and so on. You should also load the file – drag and drop usually works – into one or more of your free online storage spaces such as Microsoft OneDrive, Google Drive, Apple iCloud, Dropbox or whatever you prefer. Once the file is online, you can access it from other PCs, smartphones, tablets and other devices.You can even store your bookmarks in a Microsoft Word document, which will preserve any layout and provide Ctrl-clickable links. I do this by loading the HTML file into a browser, saving it as an MHTML or MHT file, loading that into Word and then saving it as Word file (eg as a doc, docx, rtf file, etc). Internet Explorer can save files in the standard MHTML format. Chromium-based browsers such as Google Chrome, Vivaldi and Opera can also save MHTML files if you edit the settings (chrome:flags or vivaldi:flags or opera:flags etc). Alternatively, add a browser extension such as SingleFile, which works in both Firefox and Chrome. (MHTML usefully encapsulates whole web pages in a single file, without creating a subdirectory to hold loads of separate js, css and other files.)Browsers generally use folders and subfolders to manage bookmarks. Many of them including Chrome, Firefox, Vivaldi and Edge also have synchronisation systems built in to sync bookmarks across different devices, which can be used to restore them onto replacement computers should the worst happen. However, folders can become unwieldy when you have hundreds or thousands of bookmarks, which is where bookmark managers come in.Bookmark managers generally allow you to add tags, notes and comments. Tags are useful because you can give each link multiple tags, which is like putting them in multiple folders.Bookmark managers should also provide an extension or bookmarklet so that you can bookmark sites from your browser, without going to the bookmark manager’s website.Google has one of the simplest bookmark managers, which is deservedly obscure, but could suit some users. Apple’s iCloud Bookmarks is rather better, and works in several different browsers – Safari, Firefox, Chrome, IE but not Edge – on many different devices.I have not used many bookmark managers or checked for online apps, so you’ll have to try a few to find something you like. The options include start.me, Bookmark Ninja, Dropmark, Raindrop.io, Bookmax, Atavi and, for Chrome only, Booky. Sadly, two of the most popular sites in this category – Delicious and Xmarks – have closed down.There’s also the excellent Pinboard, which now costs $11 a year. Pinboard is run by its founder, Maciej Cegłowski, who bought the remains of Delicious.  Technology used Pinboard for a few years for linkbucket blog posts.Pocket – which is incorporated into Firefox but available for Chrome – would work as a bookmark manager, but is generally used for saving pages to read later. Instapaper does much the same thing.Most researchers who need Zotero will already know about it, though it could well suit someone who likes medieval manuscripts.Otherwise, people who habitually use Microsoft OneNote or Evernote will know they can work really well as bookmark managers, as well as storing web clippings, photos, documents and many other things.Bookmarks graduated from being personal directories to shared resources on sites such as Delicious. This gave rise to social bookmarking and, from 2005-07, a boom in folksonomy or collaborative tagging. In other words, lots of different people adding tags to public links. Delicious was the archetypal example of the genre. Lots of us loved it.Folksonomy was replaced by #hashtagging. This is exactly the same thing, except that hashtags can be applied to anything, not just bookmarks. The main hashtagging sites include Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. But they are social networking sites, not bookmark managers.I would not have suggested Google+ as a bookmarking site, but perhaps its failure as a social network helped make it viable for that purpose. You could replace it with Bookmax (where free accounts are limited to 1,000 links) or Raindrop.io, but Pinterest might be the best alternative.The basic idea of Pinterest is to create public displays, but you can have any number of “secret boards”. These are private by default, though you can share them with selected people. You could create a separate board for each set of bookmarks to cover news, movies, music etc.Either way, you should download your data from Google+ before it closes on 2 April. The download page lets you select posts from your page and Google+ Communities in HTML format, plus contacts from your Circles. These are in vCard format by default, but you can select CSV, HTML or JSON instead. It doesn’t matter because you only get their name, nickname (if any) and their doomed G+ address. You don’t get their email addresses, phone numbers, job titles or anything else that might be useful.You can have your takeout data sent to Google Drive, OneDrive, Dropbox or Box, or download it from an emailed link. In my case, it was only a 9MB download, 17MB when unzipped.Have you got a question?

The challenge is completing the writing test without smudging the ink, avoiding the dreaded Tawse (the thick leather belt that sends a shiver down her granny’s spine). The school is just one of 30-odd buildings – relocated to the 32 hectare site – from different eras of Highland life from the 1700s onwards.

Young readers reveal why they adore it – from the sarcasm to the timeless love stories ... and Fat MonicaA new survey into teenage media habits done by Childwise shows that the New York-based comedy is the favourite TV show of viewers aged five to 16 in the UK. It’s a remarkable statistic, given that the majority of those surveyed would not even have been born when the series ended in 2004. We asked you to tell us why you love Friends. Here’s what some of you said:It gives us all hope that everything will work out. In real life, friendships don’t happen like they do in Friends and neither do relationships, but I think everyone who watches it wishes they did. I also think people love the idea of always having someone to talk to and share things with.My favourite character is Chandler. I think he is underplayed: many people like Joey and Phoebe because they are seen to get all the best lines, but Chandler has a different type of humour – one that I appreciate! His relationship with Monica is perfect, too, and they balance each other out.My favourite episode has to be The One with Five Steaks and an Eggplant. It’s a bit of an odd choice as the gang are at ends with each other, but I love how they do everything they can to work things out. This is really rare nowadays, when a tiny disagreement can end friendships. Molly, 15, HertfordshireI watch Friends almost every day and when I finish the 10th season I rewatch it. I find out a lot of things about life from the show. I like being treated like an adult when I hear people talking about it and I can join in. I have only been allowed to watch it since May as I’m nearly 12.I don’t have a favourite character – I have a list. My top favourite is Fat Monica. Second is Rachel and third is Chandler. Chandler is funny because he’s sarcastic and I like sarcasm.I like all the flashback episodes, but my favourite is where Rachel and Monica watch the Thanksgiving tape and see Ross about to take Rachel to prom. Leah, 11, EnfieldFriends is relatable to nearly every person, as well as being funny. It involves scenarios people my age are starting to go through, but instead of taking them seriously, it manages to make a joke of every single one. It’s based on everyday lives, and most people can relate to one of the characters. My favourite character? That’s a tough one. I’d have to go with Phoebe, because of how she deals with everything that comes her way. She gets herself into situations that are just hilarious.There are too many good episodes to choose from, however one of the best would be The One with Chandler and Monica’s Wedding: Part 2, when Rachel’s pregnancy is revealed to Monica and Phoebe. When Phoebe finds the pregnancy test she assumes it is Monica’s. When Phoebe realises that it is in fact Rachel’s, instead of revealing it, she says she is the one who is pregnant with James Brolin’s child and that she needs to call and let him know! Sam, 16, LeicesterI love Friends because it’s one of the first series (in another language) I ever watched. When I watch episodes again, it’s like going back to my comfort zone.If I had to choose a favourite episode it would be the one when Phoebe and Ross discover that Monica and Chandler have been going out. It’s SO funny … but I think I watched it too many times. Sol, 16, Rosario, ArgentinaFriends has surprisingly been a conservation-starter with a few of my friends. It’s like the glue that sticks us together. Plus, the show stands as the epitome of how friendship should be. Whenever I watch Friends, I fantasise about a friendship circle I would like to have. The silly jokes and the awkwardness between the characters are bonuses.My stand-out character is Phoebe because she is silly but smart and knowledgeable. For a person who you might think would have anger bottled up, she seems pretty calm. She takes control of her own life and she is not abashed about what she does and what she thinks. Hal, 17, IndiaFriends handles issues such as orce, unemployment and unrequited love in an excellently comedic way. It perfectly captures sibling rivalry between Ross and Monica that is surprisingly relatable. It looks at the difference of class and intellect between the friends and you get to know each one personally until you realise there is more to them than meets the eye.My favourite character has to be Chandler. His witty lines, physical comedy and mannerisms just turn him into a super lovable character. Also he’s kinda fit (good looking)! I think everyone has parts of all the characters in them, no matter how much you try not to. (Ross is my least favourite character. He’s so ANNOYING).All the episodes are really funny! If I had to choose a favourite, it would either be the one where Chandler hooks up with one of Joey’s sisters but can’t remember which one, or (spoiler alert) the one where Ross and Rachel finally start dating.

Why did the powerhouse that was black TV drama lose its way? We speak to its trailblazers‘We’re guests here, always on our best behaviour, never at ease. No wonder so many of us go round the twist.” So says Don Warrington in Carbon Copy, a television play first broadcast in 1975. Warrington’s character, Albert, is the son of Jamaican immigrants and is reassessing his place in “the mother country” after a recent awakening of his black identity. Had he been able to see four decades into the future, Albert would doubtless feel even less at ease.Last year’s shaming Windrush scandal, in which British nationals of African-Caribbean heritage were targeted for deportation by the Home Office, demonstrates how some in the UK are still determined to treat black people as “guests”. But Albert might also be depressed at the state of British television 40 years on: how little it built on pioneering dramas like Carbon Copy, and how little is even remembered of them.The title of the British Film Institute’s current season, Forgotten Black TV Drama, is no exaggeration. Most of the titles it gathers together have not been seen by the public since they were first broadcast. Between them they tell a story that is in many ways all too familiar, but in others surprising, perceptive and eerily prescient. In another forgotten drama, 1973’s The Museum Attendant, a black character declares “hating immigrants is the only thing that draws English people together”.It is often assumed that US cinema and television blazed the trail when it came to representation of black people on screen, but British television was ahead of both, argues Stephen Bourne, co-curator of the BFI season. The BBC soap Compact, which began in 1962, had a black magazine photographer, played by Horace James, as a recurring character. ITV hospital drama Emergency – Ward 10 regularly featured a black doctor, played by Joan Hooley, who embarked on a relationship with a white man – including a then-controversial interracial kiss. This was in 1964, four years before Lt Uhura and Captain Kirk kissed in Star Trek. And it wasn’t even the first such kiss on British TV (that was in the Armchair Theatre play Hot Summer Night, in 1959).Interracial relationships figure in the forgotten dramas of the BFI season, but they are by no means the sole preoccupation. The works of Jamaican-born writer Barry Reckord, for instance, are about class isions as much as racial ones. In 1962’s You in Your Small Corner, an educated young black man (played by Reckord’s brother, Lloyd) begins a love affair with a working-class white woman. And in Reckord’s Club Havana, from 1975, Warrington comes from Jamaica to his mother’s Birmingham nightclub and begins an affair with the barmaid, played by a young Julie Walters. His mother dismisses Walters as a “cheap white woman” – not good enough for her son.In Carbon Copy, too, Albert mingles with the white middle classes. His mother is a wealthy first-generation immigrant. “In England, people don’t look down on a person for being black,” she tells him. “They look down on him for being uncultured.”After rediscovering his “blackness”, Albert falls for a British-born black woman, played by Cleo Sylvestre, who is not quite as rapturous about their mystical “African” bond as he is. Nor is she into isive race politics, favouring class solidarity. “We’ve got to separate to keep our identity,” Albert tells her. “No,” she replies, “we’ve got to get together with people who’ve been screwed just like we are.”“Why should we assume that all black people that came to Britain after the second world war were working class?” says Bourne, who has researched and written about black British history and culture for 20 years. “There have been middle-class, affluent black people coming to this country since the year dot. It’s just one of those myths that needs to be addressed.”Reckord came from a well-to-do Jamaican family. He earned a scholarship to Cambridge University in 1950 (brother Lloyd joined him in the UK a year later). Between them the Reckord brothers staged and performed some of the first black British works to be performed – several of which were adapted for television.There was also Guyana-born Jan Carew and his Jamaican wife Sylvia Wynter, who spent a few fruitful years in Britain in the 1950s. Their work seems to have found sympathetic ears – on radio, then on the small screen. In 1961, ITV filmed two of Carew’s plays: The Big Pride (co-written with Wynter) and The Day of the Fox. Both are set in the Caribbean but British immigrants would readily identify with their examinations of postcolonial politics and identity. Somewhat incongruously, The Day of the Fox is led by Sammy Davis Jr - who had just made Ocean’s 11 the year before. The fact that he had to come from Hollywood to British TV to make anything vaguely “political” tells its own story.It is difficult to resist the temptation to describe this as a golden age – even if it was only a few enlightened commissioners allowing the occasional black production through the gates. By the 1980s, though, the quality black drama had somehow dried up. Bourne cites Enoch Powell’s infamous Rivers of Blood speech, in 1968, as a turning point. “After that all the good work we’d done before was erased and forgotten.”Sylvestre agrees. Before her part in Carbon Copy, she became one of the first black soap characters: Melanie in Crossroads, who turns up at the motel and announces she is the adopted daughter of the manager, Meg Richardson.According to Sylvestre, the producer Reg Watson cast her in response to Powell’s speech and the rise in racial tensions around Birmingham, where the show was set. “He wanted to show a young, black character who wasn’t defined by her colour,” says Sylvestre. “It was a very bold move at that time. In fact, I used to get people coming up to me in the street who I’m sure would have agreed with Enoch Powell who’d say, ‘Oh, I love your character.’”For the most part, comedy became the preferred medium for broaching British ersity. Warrington went on to star in one of the better offerings: Rising Damp. His character Philip, who claimed to be an African prince but was actually from Croydon, was often the subject of landlord Rigsby’s animosity. Far less sophisticated was Love Thy Neighbour, which wrung crude, cringeworthy racial humour out of a black couple and a white couple living next door to each other. The white husband routinely referred to his black counterpart (Rudolph Walker) as “nig-nog” or “sambo”.That shift from drama to comedy is clearly visible in the work of writer Trix Worrell, best known as the creator of the hit 1990s sitcom Desmond’s. Originally a theatre director, Worrell made his TV debut in 1984, after he won a scriptwriting competition held by the recently launched Channel 4.His play, Just Like Mohicans – also part of the BFI’s season – was adapted into a 40-minute TV drama. It is virtually a two-hander: an encounter between an elderly Jamaican widow and a hip-hop-savvy black teenager (future EastEnders regular Gary Beadle) who breaks into her house to burgle her. The relationship steadily morphs from victim-criminal to mother-son, and the play becomes an angry clash of generational values.It was heavily autobiographical, acknowledges Worrell, who was born in St Lucia and moved to London as a child in the mid-60s. “Our parents bought into that whole empire, British thing and wanted to better us and better themselves. But we were on the street. We had to suffer the slings and arrows. We were the kids that suffered Sus” – “suspected person” laws, a 1980s precursor to stop and search. “We were walking home from school and being spat at and called all sorts of crap – and that’s just by the police. Shit happened all the time. So you start to go, what the hell are we here for?”The only positive representation Worrell remembers growing up was Carmen Munroe as a nurse on ITV soap General Hospital (he later cast her in Desmond’s). But they still watched Love Thy Neighbour, he says. “We watched it because there we were. We could see ourselves on screen, and that was a thrill in and of itself.” There was also the newsreader Trevor McDonald, Worrell adds. “So it went from the sublime to the ridiculous: Trevor reading the News at 10 and Rudy Walker being called a ‘nig-nog’ in the same evening.”Desmond’s was arguably the first mainstream series to simply accept black Britons as characters in their own right, and it was a huge hit. “I’ve always said you can sell more in comedy than you can in drama,” says Worrell. “You can be more hard-hitting. You can bash them over the head and make them laugh at the same time.”Times have moved on and representation has improved immensely on British television but looking back at the passionate, angry, questioning dramas of the 1960s and 70s, something has been lost. Subsequent generations seem to have had less of a platform to engage with these issues seriously – at least on the small screen.New black British talent is more likely to thrive in the US than at home, looking at the experience of actors such as Idris Elba, Thandie Newton, Daniel Kaluuya, Gugu Mbatha-Raw and John Boyega. The continuity has been broken. The contributions of these black dramatists and performers is in danger of being erased, from history and from the archives. It is never too late to start remembering."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbd7d01dcf0e15f66f97c89e2494990efc4cc131/0_325_4916_2951/master/4916.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bf0f95e9c8313ba737993fbf2162382a","title":"new zealands waitangi day 2019 celebrations in pictures","story":"The national holiday celebrates the signing of the treaty of Waitangi on 6 February 1840 by Māori chiefs and the British Crown that granted the Māori people the rights of British citizens and ownership of their lands and other properties"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3784560.1549484261!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"british nuclear waste facility could be located near newry","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tNuclear waste is stored at about 30 sites across Britain, but predominantly at ground level at the Sellafield reprocessing plant in Cumbria. Photograph: PAThe Border town of Newry is being considered as a location to dispose of the United Kingdom’s nuclear waste, with research identifying the area as potentially suitable for an underground disposal facility.It is one of five sites in Northern Ireland under consideration as possible stores for the waste and among 45 being examined across the UK as whole.An area of granite bedrock near Newry may be suitable for a geological disposal facility (GDF), according to a recent preliminary report by Radioactive Waste Management (RWM), a UK State-owned company.The area of rock stretches from Slieve Gullion to the Mourne mountains. Geological disposal sites hold radioactive waste hundreds of metres underground, and there are no current facilities in Northern Ireland.Future policy decisions on nuclear disposal in Northern Ireland rest with the Stormont executive, where power-sharing has been collapsed for more than two years. The British government’s current preference is that one facility would service the entire UK, a spokesman for RWM has said. Any future facility would need the support of the local community before it could be approved.Nuclear waste is stored at about 30 sites across Britain, but predominantly at ground level at the Sellafield reprocessing plant in Cumbria.Granite“There are granites and similar strong rocks around Newry, in which we may be able to site a GDF,” the recent RWM report said. “We would need to do more work to find out whether these rocks have suitable properties and thicknesses in the depth range of interest for a GDF.” Preliminary reports into other regions of Northern Ireland found a section of strong rock between Omagh and Cookstown, Co Tyrone, which might support a similar facility.A number of areas in the north of the country could also possibly be suitable, researchers found. These included one location between Belfast and Larne, areas around Coleraine, Co Derry, and Ballymoney and Ballycastle, in Co Antrim.On Monday, an emergency motion was passed at the Newry, Mourne and Down District Council, unanimously opposing locating any nuclear waste facility in the local area.Some 45 preliminary regional reports had been completed across the UK, assessing what locations might have suitable rock types to build a facility. The reports began a process that could take 10 to 15 years to identify a suitable area, gain the consent of a local community and build the facility, the RWM spokesman said. There was a “false narrative” that nuclear waste disposal facilities would be forced on communities, he said. The waste facility will contain multiple barriers to secure the radioactive material underground for hundreds of thousands of years. The British government has also promised communities hosting future facilities significant investment.Responding to the Newry report, Sinn Féin MP for South Down Chris Hazzard said Britain could not be allowed to use the North “as a dumping ground” for its hazardous and toxic waste. “Not only would this have dire consequences for our environment but it would also pose a serious health risk to the population,” he said.Fine Gael councillor for Dundalk, Co Louth, John McGahon said the initial report was likely nothing more than a “fishing expedition”.He said the probability of any plan being approved was “extremely remote”. It was important politicians on both sides of the Border were not “asleep on the issue,” but equally that local representatives did not engage in “scaremongering,” he said.

But the European Council president (61) was filmed laughing after a press conference with the Irish leader Leo Varadkar who had told him he would get “terrible trouble” over the rant.: Tusk warns of ‘special place in hell’ for those who backed Brexit without a planThe European Union’s frustration with the British government has erupted into the open, prompting a vicious war of words across the Channel as Theresa May heads to Brussels to try to salvage her Brexit deal.Unscripted comments from Donald Tusk, president of the European council, warning of a “special place in hell” for those who pushed for Brexit “without even a sketch of a plan” set off a furious reaction in London. opinion piece: Donald Tusk’s special place in hell looks like where we are right nowAfter a Brussels press conference punctuated with knowing sighs, in which he again made clear the withdrawal agreement was not up for renegotiation but that – as a gesture of goodwill – he was willing to entertain sensible alternative suggestions from the UK government, the EU Council’s president concluded with a simple thought. “I’ve been wondering,” he mused, “what that special place in hell looks like, for those who promoted Brexit without even a sketch of a plan how to carry it out safely.”This was Donald Tusk unplugged. A politician tired of diplomacy that kept going nowhere – “What bit of backstop doesn’t the UK get?” – and happy for once to speak his mind. “They’ll give you a terrible time in the British press for that,” whispered a delighted Leo Varadkar, the Irish Taoiseach. Tusk merely smiled. “Yes, I know. Hahaha.” He no longer cared that much what anyone thought. He had tried to be nice to the Brits but all you got in return was news bulletins with Theresa May in a Spitfire and people comparing the EU’s aims with Hitler.The Daily Mirror: Brexiteers will have a ‘special place in hell’ declares EU chief Donald TuskBrexiteers will have a ‘special place in hell’, EU chief Donald Tusk declared in an extraordinary, furious speech. The European Council President lashed out at Tories who pushed Brexit without a plan as talks remain deadlocked just 51 days before the UK is supposed to leave.The Financial Times: Tusk warns of a ‘special place in hell’ for Brexiters with no planTheresa May is braced for a hostile reception in Brussels on Thursday, with EU chief Donald Tusk fuming over her failure to come up with new ideas to rescue her Brexit deal and saying there was “a special place in hell” for the UK’s leading Eurosceptics.The European Council president’s remarkable outburst reflected Mr Tusk’s “genuine, deep frustration with the mess that we are in”, according to one EU official, but it only complicated Mrs May’s attempt to placate pro-Brexit Tory MPs.The prime minister’s visit is intended to explore ways to revise the deal that was heavily rejected by the house of commons last month, but hopes of a breakthrough were set at zero: “We will go there and they will say No,” said one May aide.They weren’t off-the-cuff remarks, but a planned outburst. The softly-spoken politician who holds the authority of all EU countries has just completely condemned a chunk of the British cabinet, wondering aloud: “What that special place in hell looks like for those who promoted Brexit, without even a sketch of a plan how to carry it out safely”. Sure, for a long time the EU has been frustrated with how the UK has approached all of this. And sure, plenty of voters in the UK are annoyed too at how politicians have been handling these negotiations.But it is quite something for Donald Tusk to have gone in like this, studs up, even though he sometimes reminisces about his time as a football hooligan in his youth. Be clear, he was not intending to talk about voters who wanted to leave, but politicians who were involved in the campaign.Süddeutsche Zeitung: Tusk: “Special place in hell” for the BrexiteersDonald Tusk is known for his ironic comments. In September, the EU Council president posted a picture of himself and British prime minister Theresa May at a cake buffet on Instagram. With an ironic reference to the difficult British wishes in the Brexit negotiations, he wrote: “A piece of cake, maybe? Sorry, no cherries.” The accusation of picking out only the best made great indignation in Britain.Even months later, the Brexit drama has not ended and Tusk has since developed his own ideas of what the British Brexit followers deserve: a place in hell. “I was wondering what the special place in hell would be for those who pushed Brexit without even having a blueprint for putting it safely on the grid,” Tusk said after meeting the Taoiseach Leo Varadkar on Wednesday in Brussels.Sammy Wilson, a DUP MP, has branded Donald Tusk a “devilish Euro maniac” after the European Council president said there will be “a special place in hell” for those who promoted Brexit without any plan for how to deliver it safely. Mr Tusk’s comments came as he repeated the EU’s insistence that the Withdrawal Agreement reach with British prime minister last year cannot be reopened to remove the backstop arrangement for the border.He was speaking alongside Taoiseach Leo Varadkar after talks in Brussels in which they discussed preparations for what Mr. Tusk described as the “fiasco” of a no-deal Brexit on March 29th. Mr Wilson, the DUP’s spokesman on Brexit accused Mr Tusk of showing contempt for those who voted for the UK to leave the EU. “This devilish Euro maniac is doing his best to keep to keep the United Kingdom bound by the chains of EU bureaucracy and control,” he tweeted. He added: “All he will succeed in doing is stiffening the resistance of those who have exercised their choice to be clear of Tusk and his trident-wielding cabal.”The Irish News opinion piece: This is not the time for inflammatory languageWith March 29th fast approaching and the prospects of a deal looking slim, tensions are high. This febrile context provides a part explanation for Donald Tusk’s remarks if not justification – but then again, it’s difficult to not understand the European council’s frustration. He’s certainly not alone in being bewildered and disheartened by the antics of the British government in recent months...that said, this is not a time for inflammatory language and equally, the tone of Mr Tusk’s remarks was unbecoming for an EU figurehead even if you sympathise with the sentiment."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3785324.1549533677!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"nurses and midwives hold third 24 hour strike over pay","story":"On day three of their strike INMO general secretary Phil Ni Sheaghdha has said that the strikes by nurses have lifted the lid on the massive risk that exists in the health service on a daily basis due to staff shortages. Video: Bryan O\u0027Brien \t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tNurses picket outside St Vincent’s Hospital, Dublin as part of a dispute over pay. Photograph: Nick BradshawThe strikes by nurses this week and last have lifted the lid on the massive risk that exists in the health service on a daily basis due to staff shortages, their trade union has said. As members of the Irish Nurses and Midwives (INMO) hold a third 24-hour strike over pay and staffing issues on Thursday, its general secretary Phil Ni Sheaghdha said all of a sudden HSE managers who due to the stoppages were working a 24-hour cycle were recognizing this risk. Asked whether the work stoppages were placing patients at risk, she said: “there is a massive risk in the health service in a daily basis due to staff shortages. What we are doing is highlighting the risk that exists every single day.”She said the INMO had made very stringent efforts to put in place emergency services that will continue. “We have been meeting the HSE continuously for the last three weeks. We have agreed many derogations. And in addition to that we link in with then every two hours. “She said the union was satisfied with the emergency services that were being provided during the days of strikes. “What we are not satisfied about us the level of care that exists on an ordinary day. We know that is high risk and does not provide a safe level of care for patients. That is why nurses and midwives are protesting and on strike.”Ms Ni Sheaghdha said the union had received no correspondence from Government about finding a resolution and she said her members remained “resolute”.40,000About 40,000 nurses who are INMO members are taking part in the strike today in a dispute over pay. About 50,000 patients are likely to be affected by the stoppage which will see all outpatient, inpatient and day surgery appointments scheduled for today cancelled. Minor injury units will be closed and routine community nursing services and health centre nurse clinics will also be cancelled. Thursday is the third in a series of eight 24-hour strikes planned by nurses over their pay claim and nurses are planning to strike for three days next week. Nurses also plan to strike on February 19th and 21st. They are seeking pay parity with other medical professionals which would equate to an approximately €7,000 pay rise per nurse, or a rise of around 12 per cent. The Government has said it will not offer additional payments to nurses, although it said on Monday it was willing to discuss staffing and other non-pay issues. Nursing unions have rejected the proposal. Separately, an overtime ban by psychiatric nurses has resulted in what the HSE describe as “significant challenges” in ensuring a safe service in mental health facilities Wednesday. This ban will continue throughout Thursday night. The HSE said it was “continuing to engage and negotiate with the PNA”. On Wednesday night, ambulance service staff said they would also go on strike next week. Up to 500 ambulance workers plan to strike for three more days in the weeks ahead as part of a dispute over trade union representation rights and the deduction of union subscriptions at source from their pay.The staff, who are members of the National Ambulance Service Representative Association (Nasra), will stage stoppages on Friday, February 15th Thursday, February 28th and Friday, March 1st.The action will run from 7am to 5 pm each day. Members of Nasra already staged a 10-hour work stoppage at the end of January. "},{"url":null,"title":"brexit an idiot s guide to the united kingdom leaving the european union","story":"Brexit basicsBrexit - A combination of the word Britain and exit was coined in 2012 to describe the idea of the United Kingdom leaving the European Union. So it should probably have been Ukexit but Brexit trips off the tongue better.Peter Wilding, the managing director of the British Influence think tank, is credited with coining the term Brexit. Wilding was former Conservative party leader David Cameron’s media and policy director of the Conservative Party in the EU from 2005 to 2008.Wilding, who campaigned for the UK to remain within the EU, first used the phrase in 2012 before it was first used publicly by Cameron. Brexit is a first cousin, once removed, of Grexit, which was used to describe Greece’s possible departure from the euro zone during the economic crisis.David who? David Cameron is the former Conservative Party leader and British prime minister. He romped home with a big majority in 2015 riding a wave of a promise he gave to Tory hardliners to hold an inout referendum on the UK’s membership of the European Union. The feeling is\u0026nbspneither he, nor anyone else, really believed the vote would pass. His election victory is now a distant memory. Cameron is rarely seen but is sometimes spotted avoiding members of the media as he jumps into a black Range Rover. Or as Eastenders star Danny Dyer put it, Cameron, who he labelled a “twat”, was in France “with his trotters up” while everybody else was dealing with the Brexit calamity.Theresa May - Ok, so unless you’ve been living under a large rock with no wifi, you’ll know that Theresa May is the Conservative Party leader and current British prime minister. At least as long as nobody else on the planet wants the job. She became British prime minister\u0026nbspin July 2016 in the wake of the Brexit vote and the resignation of Cameron. May who will be 63 in October 2019, was first elected an MP for Maidenhead in 1997 and served as British home secretary (basically, our minister for justice) from 2010 to 2016.Article 50 - This is the “get out clause” of the Treaty of Lisbon. It grants an EU member state the power to quit the bloc unilaterally. Once triggered, it gives the departing country two years to negotiate an exit deal. Theresa May triggered the UK’s exit on March 29th, 2017, scheduling Brexit for 11pm on March 29th, 2019, and starting the countdown clock. A European Court of Justice ruling has said the UK can unilaterally withdraw its article 50 application but extending it, thereby postponing the exit, would require unanimous agreement from the European Council, the group of EU heads of state and government.The Withdrawal Agreement - This is the deal reached in November 2018 between May and the European Union on the terms under which Britain would exit the EU. Also known as the “WA”, the “orce deal” and “Theresa May’s deal” it includes a transition period of two years (and possibly longer) after Britain leaves when not much would change. It also contains a provision called the backstop that will kick in to keep the Irish Border open in the event that trading and border arrangements sufficient to achieve this aren’t reached during the transition period.Apart from the backstop, the key issues it covers are the mutual rights of EU and UK citizens now living in each other’s territory and the UK’s financial obligations to the EU (often referred to the the “orce bill”). It is not yet ratified as it is facing strong opposition in the House of Commons. The European Parliament also needs to approve it.The Political Declaration - This is a separate document also agreed in November 2018 between the two sides setting out how they hoped the future relationship will develop in key areas including trade, political and security co-operation and so on. Unlike the withdrawal agreement, this is a political (not a legal) document. So it could be tweaked to try to bring the UK parliament on side.Backstop: The backstop, part of the withdrawal agreement, is a kind of insurance policy that will kick in to ensure that there is no hard border in Ireland, no matter what the outcome is of future trade talks between the UK and the EU. The agreement involves a transition period, a kind of standstill when most current arrangements would apply until the end of 2020, at least. It can be extended up to the end of 2022. If a trade deal between the EU and UK is not finalised in this time or is not far-reaching enough to ensure that no border checks are needed, then the backstop kicks in. It would involve the whole of the UK staying in a customs union with the EU and the North also sticking to some of the rules and regulations set down in the EU single market. Both sides say they want to avoid using the backstop, or if it is triggered to ensure this only happens for a short period. The term comes from cricket it is a fielding position where the backstop stands behind the wicket-keeper to stop the ball reaching the boundary and prevent the batting team from scoring should the wicket-keeper miss it.Transition period: This is the standstill period which would start immediately the UK leaves on March 29th under the withdrawal agreement. The UK would remain in the EU trading bloc - as a member of the single market and customs union and the rights of business and citizens would remain. The transition period - sometimes referred to by the UK government as the implementation period - would last at least until December 2020. There is scope to extend it until December 2022, at the latest. Brexit supporters don’t like it as it would keep the UK tied to EU laws, but with no say in how these are changed.No-deal Brexit: This means the UK leaving at the end of March- or at some later date if an extension is agreed - without the withdrawal agreement being ratified. This would mean that all the UK’s legal links to the EU would end overnight, new trading rules and regulatory regimes would come into effect immediately. It has led to warnings of economic chaos for the UK and Ireland and more widely in some sectors such as car manufacturing.The EU Single Market - The body of rules, regulations and practices designed to allow free movement of people, capital, goods and services across the EU.The EU Customs Union - The agreement that goods can move freely within the EU with no tariffs, or special import taxes, being applied as they move from one country to another. It also involves common agreed tariff levels on goods coming into the union from outside - meaning that once they enter the EU they too can also circulate freely.Brexit lingo - the everyday phrases\u0026nbspBrexiters - these are simply people in favour of Brexit. Brexiteers are Brexiters, but not necessarily the other way around.Brexiteers - If Brexit and the Three Musketeers had a love child it would be a Brexiteer. The term is used to describe those who are fervently in favour of Brexit to the point, perhaps, where they would carry a sword to make their point. Jacob Rees-Mogg and Boris Johnson are Brexiteers, although we are in no way suggesting they would resort to violence to further their cause.Arch Brexiteer- A Brexiteer with a cherry on top, imagine if Jacob Rees-Mogg or Boris Johnson had a love child with the Incredible Hulk’s angry sister.Remainer - Somebody who voted against the UK leaving the European Union. Can sometimes be heard apologising to the Irish nation on radio and television news programmes or sitting in tears in a hipster cafe in central London reading Fintan O’Toole’s latest  column.Remoaner - A derogatory term used by Brexiters, Brexiteers or Arch Brexiteers to describe a Remainer. Calling someone a remoaner is up there with calling your female work colleague a nag.Red Lines - Issues where compromise is not an option. Everyone from the Democratic Unionist Party to the Dublin Government to the British government to the Conservative party hardliners to the European Union itself have their own favourite red lines. There are so many red lines, it very quickly after June 2016 began to look like a big bowl of spaghetti and red pesto. There is a lot of talk now, in particular, about whether Theresa May will move any of her “red lines” to try the break the logjam and win House of Commons support for her deal.Strong and stable - British prime minister Theresa May called a snap election in April 2017 saying the UK needed a “strong and stable” government because of Brexit. It is an expression she would live to regret after she lost her majority and was forced to rely on the Democratic Unionist Party to prop up her minority government. The DUP are among the most vociferously opposed to the withdrawal agreement Theresa May negotiated with the EU and to the backstop. The institutions expected to guarantee strong and stable society in the UK and other democracies are now very weak and unstable.Brino or Bino - “Brexit in name only” is the position the United Kingdom might find itself in if it were to leave the EU on terms dictated to it whereby the country must align itself to such an extent that it would operate in almost the same fashion as if it were inside the EU. So it would have left the European Union but would be still subject to the same trading rules and legal obligations. Bino is the worst case scenario for those who want Brexit.Irexit - A second cousin of both Brexit and Grexit, this describes Ireland’s exit from the European Union, which of course if very unlikely to happen any time in the near future. The most recent Eurobarometer survey shows Irish people to be more than happy with EU membership, notwithstanding our relationship with European authorities during the economic crash.Regrexit: The feeling of regret and guilt for voting in favour of Brexit. The phenomenon was felt as soon as the morning after the vote in June 2016 as it is thought many voted for Brexit as a protest against other issues with the assumption it would not pass. Doh!Nebulous - What Theresa May accused European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker of calling her during a Brussels showdown in December. That’s according to lip-readers. He was calling “the British position” nebulous, he insisted. The whole episode was caught on camera and the entire world collectively wished Mammy and Daddy would stop arguing. Explaining the episode afterwards May said: “I had a robust discussion with Jean-Claude Juncker. I think that’s the sort of discussion you’re able to have when you’ve developed a working relationship and you work together. And what came out of that was his clarity that when he used that particular phrase he’d been talking about the general level of debate. I had further conversations with him through the morning,” she said.Nebulous (2) - Lady Sylia Hermon described the proposals in an amendment supported by Theresa May’s government to come up with an “alternative” to the backstop as nebulous.Hard border - This refers to the situation where border checkpoints by police andor soldiers would be erected to regulate the movement of people and goods between the Republic of Ireland, which will continue to be in the EU and Northern Ireland, which will remain in the UK and therefore outside the European Union. The idea strikes fear into the hearts of most people on the island of Ireland and many in Britain given how much a target border infrastructure was for paramilitaries during the Troubles. Not to mention the disruption a hard border would cause to everyday life in border communities. The backstop was set up specifically to avoid the hard border.Soft or frictionless border - This describes how the Border between the Republic and Northern Ireland operates now. People can move freely back and forth without even knowing which jurisdiction they are in. Think leaving Forkhill to visit your Aunty Mary in Dundalk without getting stopped by a soldier to ask what’s in the boot of your car. Goods can move freely too, with no hindrance or checks, though there are police operations against smuggling.The buzzwords\u0026nbspSecond referendum - This is a mechanism deployed in Ireland several times, designed to allow people who feel regrexit to have another bite at the cherry. Those who want a second vote say the electorate was led down the garden path the first time around, while those against it say the people have already spoken. If a second referendum were to be held it remains unclear which side would win. Remember that snap UK election Theresa May called in 2017 seeking a strong mandate from the people? They ended up with a lame duck administration propped up by the arch-Brexiteer Democratic Unionist Party. Dealing with the electorate is like trying to herd cats - anything could happen.Unless and until - The phrase used many, many times, to describe how long the provisions of the backstop would stay in place, i.e. unless or until there is an agreement that ensures no hard border in Ireland. Tánaiste Simon Coveney has been saying it at the drop of a hat. For Brexiters, Brexiteers and arch Brexiteers it is the proverbial nails on the Brexit blackboard.Time-limited backstop - A key problem in the UK parliament with the backstop plan is that – after the transition period – it commits the UK to stay in a customs union with the EU until another solution is found to the Irish border issue. For this reason there are demands to put a time-limit on the backstop. However, for Ireland and the EU this goes against the “ unless and until” commitment.Alternative arrangements - The UK argues that there are other ways to control goods flowing across the Irish border, apart from physical infrastructure. And so these are alternatives to the backstop . These include advanced customs processes and the use of specialist technology to monitor the movement of goods. The EU has promised in the draft withdrawal agreement to assess alternatives to the backstop with the UK, but has pointed out that there is no border anywhere between two trading zones where some checks do not take place .Maxfac - Maximum facilitation or “maxfac” is a phrase often used by Brexiteers to describe the idea that technology and customs processes can be used to avoid a hard border with infrastructure.The Malthouse Proposal - a plan which has found support in the Conservative Party late in the day, for the UK to exit the EU and replace the backstop with a free-trade deal with the EU combined with the use of technology to do away with customs checks. It also proposes to extend the standstill transition period until the end of 2021. It sounds like it was dreamt up in a pub but in fact it was brokered by housing minister Kit Malthouse.SoftSofter Brexit - It had been thought that Theresa May, following the rejection of her original deal in the House of Commons, might try to reach agreement on a softer version of Brexit. A softer Brexit would mean the UK remaining more closely aligned to EU rules and regulations and probably also remaining in a customs union with the EU. However there has as yet been no effort to reach this kind of deal with Labour, whose support May would need to get this over the line in the House of Commons.Canada ++ - This is the idea that the UK would end up, after Brexit, in a free trade deal with the EU similar to the one completed with Canada but hopefully involving an even closer relationship (hence, plus, or plus plus). The trading arrangements between the two sides are only due to be negotiated after Brexit takes place. If there is a no-deal Brexit and no agreement on the terms on which the UK leaves, it is not clear what the options will be for future negotiations.Norway - A Scandinavian country’s name but also used to describe the way Norway trades and relates to the European Union. The Norway model might be considered Bino by Brexiters as it would involve staying in the EU single market and subject to its rules (though overseen by a separate court). Norway-plus is sometimes used to refer to a Norway-style deal with additional membership of a customs union with the EU. This would solve the Irish Border problem but would be too close a relationship for the Brexiteers.WTO rules - If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, then it will trade with the EU and everyone else – on the basis of rules set down by the World Trade Organisation. This would involve tariffs, or special import taxes, on goods moving in and out of the UK to EU and third country markets. The UK would hope to maintain existing trade links, negotiated by the EU, with many other countries and also to do a future trade deal with the EU. There is debate on whether, immediately after leaving, the UK would immediately invoke WTO rules. It is meant to deal with all countries with which it does not have a trade deal the same, but enforcement of this is via a long drawn-out disputes process.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

This set the UK on course to leave the EU, but left all the details of its exit still to be decided. The timetable was set the following March 29th, when British prime minister Theresa May took the formal step, required under EU law to start the exit process, of triggering Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty. Under the two-year process the UK will leave the EU on March 29th, 2019. An extension to the exit period is possible\u0026nbspif all 28 EU members agree. However negotiations have been taking place on the assumption that the UK leaves in March 2019.\u0026nbspThe talks between the UK and EU started in June 2017 and so far have focused on the details of the UK’s withdrawal, which must be set down in a formal, legal agreement. Outline agreement has been reached on what the UK will pay the EU after departure – the so-called exit bill or orce bill – and on the mutual recognition of the rights of UK citizens in the EU and EU citizens in the UK.In November, agreement was also reached on a backstop for the Irish border, a way to provide a guarantee that there be no hard border on the island of Ireland no matter what future trade arrangements are agreed between the EU and UK.\u0026nbspThis cleared the way for a draft withdrawal agreement and final talks on a political declaration outlining the principles for future negotiations. This draft needs to be ratified politically by both sides.For a country to leave the EU is unprecedented ‑ and the extent of the complications has\u0026nbspslowly become evident\u0026nbspin the last couple of years. EU membership is a central part of the economy and society of all its members and unscrambling this is very complex, before account is even taken of sketching out how the two sides will relate to each other in future.Much of the discussion has been about the UK’s membership of the EU trading bloc. There are two elements to this. First, the UK is part of the EU customs union. This is a free trade area under which allows goods to circulate freely through the EU. Part of this is a commitment by all members to impose the same import tariffs – or taxes – on goods entering from outside the EU.The UK is also part of the EU single market, the system of rules and regulations which allow free movement of goods, services, people and capital. Together, membership of the customs union and single market allows goods to move freely across the EU and also for free trade in services like banking. Common EU regulations also underpin trade in a host of different areas, for example pharmaceuticals and food.The single market also allows free movement of people across the EU. The UK is also involved in common international policies co-ordinated at EU level, notably in foreign policy and defence and in trade deals with other countries.Brexit talks between the UK and the EU are taking place in a sequenced order, which has led to no little confusion in the debate.What has been agreed are the draft terms on which the UK leaves, contained\u0026nbspin the withdrawal agreement. A political declaration on what the future relationship might look like has also been finalised. However, details of the future relationship between the EU and UK will be decided in talks after the UK actually leaves ‑ \u0026nbspassuming the two sides are still talking.In the short term the conclusion of the withdrawal agreement would mean that once the UK leaves in March 2019 a transition period, a kind of standstill, would commence and last until the end of 2020. The draft withdrawal agreement also suggests that this transition period could be extended until 2022. If the agreement is ratified and the transition period kicks in, not much will change on March 29th, except for the UK’s formal departure.If there is no withdrawal agreement, then the UK would leave the EU in a so-called “no-deal” Brexit in March 2019, which could be chaotic as barriers to trade would go up overnight and there would be uncertainties in areas ranging from aviation to pharmaceuticals to co-operation in nuclear regulation. There is speculation that the EU and UK would work together to try to avoid the worst of the chaos – though they could only do so much ‑ \u0026nbspor even that there might be late moves to delay the UK’s exit date.The crunch point is that the EU insists that the UK must either be fully in the EU trading bloc and accept all the rules, or be out of it, and have a relationship similar to the EU and Canada. For the UK, the more closely aligned it remains with the EU, the less freedom it will have to set its own economic course after Brexit.The UK’s departure from the EU means Northern Ireland is leaving the bloc too so checks would be required along the 499-kilometre Irish Border as different trade rules would apply north and south after Brexit. The Border in Ireland will become the only land border between the UK and the EU after Brexit.The 1998 Belfast Agreement laid the foundation for Northern Ireland’s peace process with many all-island rules and institutions. Neither side wants the return of border checks because of the risk to peace whereby a physical border infrastructure would be considered a potential target for paramilitaries.The economic impact of Brexit is negative, for both the UK, Ireland and the rest of the EU. The biggest impact will be in the UK itself and in Ireland, its closest trading partner. \u0026nbspFor the UK, any trade arrangement reached after Brexit – barring full membership of the EU trading bloc, which the UK has ruled out – will be less favourable than current arrangements. Economists say that any new trade opportunities elsewhere will not make up for losses in trade with the EU. Weaker sterling since Brexit has already cut the purchasing power of UK consumers and uncertainty has hit investment, with growth estimated to be 1 to 2 per cent per annum lower over the couple of years.For Ireland, growth remains strong and the main short-term impact has been via a weaker sterling exchange rate, which is good if you’re going to the UK to buy a second-hand car but bad if you’re an exporter to the UK market.\u0026nbspThe main threat to Brexit comes from barriers to exports to the UK and also delays and higher prices for importers of UK goods to Ireland. Forecasters have estimated that in a harder version of Brexit, where the UK leaves the EU trading bloc, the Irish economy could be 4 to 7 per cent lower in a decade’s time, with most of the hit in the first five years. A no-deal Brexit means the economic effect would be more severe and happen more quicklyFebruary 13th, 2019:\u0026nbspTheresa May has scheduled a second “meaningful vote” on her Brexit deal for this date after the UK parliament rejected the withdrawal agreement brokered with the EU by 432 votes to 202 on January 15th.February 22nd, 2019: Irish Government hopes to publish in full emergency legislation to cope with a no-deal Brexit, the Miscellaneous Provisions (Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union) Bill. This is an omnibus piece of legislation with 17 sections covers a range of areas including economic, social, transport, health and justice activities.March 14th, 2019: The Government is targeting the passage of the ‘hard Brexit’ emergency legislation by the Oireachtas by this date.February to March, 2019: If the withdrawal deal is on track, then national and regional parliaments across the EU will vote on it. The European Parliaments has to approve it by a simple majority.11pm, March 29th, 2019: Brexit - the United Kingdom is scheduled to leave the European Union.

Photograph: Olivier HosletEPAWe are in clutching-at-straws mode here, with barely 50 days to go to a “hard” British departure.And so on Monday, when there was a hint that the European Commission was coming up with a new idea – however thin – to break the backstop deadlock, it was pored over by the British press in forensic detail. In truth a storm in a teacup.Had commission secretary general Martin Selmayr, president Jean-Claude Juncker’s right-hand man, really suggested that it might be willing to add to the withdrawal agreement the assurances given to the UK by Juncker and European Council president Donald Tusk, to give them legally binding force?Well, not exactly. In fact, not at all, according to Selmayr, after MPs from the Commons cross-party Brexit select committee suggested as much following a long meeting with him.At issue was whether the idea, which was certainly discussed, emanated from Selmayr or from the MPs. If the former, was he really suggesting that the commission, contrary to its repeated insistence, would be prepared to “reopen” the 585-page withdrawal agreement to include what has been described variously as an additional “codicil” or protocol?‘Unzipping’“I would term it unzipping,” he explained somewhat indelicately.Responding to press reports of the meeting, Selmayr tweeted a non-denial denial saying: “On the EU side, nobody is considering this.”He added: “Asked whether any assurance would help to get the withdrawal agreement through the Commons, the answers of MPs were ... inconclusive...”What Selmayr did make clear to the group, having emphasised that he, no more than they, was not a negotiator, was that the EU was unlikely to concede anything new without cast-iron guarantees from the UK that would swing the Commons behind them.Any premature offer, Brussels knows, could simply be pocketed by Brexiteers with an endless series of demands for yet more. We are not going there.Kinnock reported that “Selmayr’s question to the Brexiteers was: If we did that, would you vote it through? And they weren’t able to answer that question.”Tory Brexiteer MP Stephen Crabb acknowledged the secretary general was concerned that adding the legally-binding assurance would be worthless if offered to MPs.‘Legal protocol’Crabb told the Express: “We talked around the idea of the Tusk letter being written into some sort of legal protocol but everytime someone asked him if it is something he could do, he said first of all it’s not me negotiating and secondly let me turn around the question – if we were to do that would you be guaranteed to vote for the deal?”A commission spokeswoman on Tuesday described the account as the most accurate report of the meeting – probably the first time the Eurosceptic paper had ever been praised by the commission.In truth few believe that these assurances, even in legally-binding form, could provide Theresa May with anything like the swing votes for her deal that she needs. If this is indeed what she will be seeking in her visit here on Thursday.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe Juncker and Tusk letter of assurance was sent to the British prime minister last month to help clarify the EU understanding of the backstop, and specifically to respond to demands for a time limit or unilateral exit mechanism from it. But it made clear that the EU is not in a position to resile from or in any way undermine the obligations set out in the withdrawal agreement, specifically its Northern Ireland protocol.‘Facilitate the next steps’“As you know,” the letter says, “we are not in a position to agree to anything that changes or is inconsistent with the withdrawal agreement, but against this background, and in order to facilitate the next steps of the process, we are happy to confirm, on behalf of the two EU institutions we represent, our understanding . . . ”That understanding involves a joint view of the backstop as a malign necessity which can only be temporary “unless and until” it is replaced by an agreement on a future relationship which provides the sort of guarantees necessary to safeguard a frictionless border.The commission commits to entering negotiations and proceeding with them as expeditiously as possible with a view to ensuring that when the extendable transition period of two years comes to an end it will not be necessary to trigger the backstop.Why anyone should believe that a reiteration of that kind of assurance, whether or not in legally binding form, would help build a May majority is not clear.

He was speaking after talks with  Leo Varadkar in Brussels. \t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFigures from the Irish-American caucus on Capitol Hill said they would definitely speak out fi the Belfast Agreement was threatened.Britain’s hope of striking a trade deal with the United States after Brexit could be in jeopardy if the Belfast Agreement is compromised by Britain’s withdrawal from the European Union, senior US figures have warned.Speaking at an event in the United States Capitol building to mark the 100th anniversary of the Dáil, Republican congressman Peter King told an audience: “If the British want to consider any type of trade agreement with the United States it is important that the soft border is maintained.”He continued: “What influence we have, we will use it, in the Friends of Ireland” he said, referring to the Irish-American caucus on Capitol Hill. “We will definitely speak out.”His warning was echoed by Richard Neal, the Massachusetts congressman who was recently appointed chairman of the Ways and Means committee. The committee has sweeping powers over US trade policy, and would have ultimate oversight of any trade agreement signed between the United States and Britain after Brexit.Trade dealSpeaking at the event, which was hosted to honour Tánaiste Simon Coveney who is on a three-day visit to the United States, Mr Neal said that concerns about the Belfast Agreement would “weigh on his mind” as his committee considers a new trade deal between the United States and Britain.He said he has already outlined his concerns to the United States trade representative, Robert Lighthizer, although he ultimately wanted a trade deal between the US and United Kingdom.“I think that America is heavily invested in the success of the Good Friday Agreement and anything that might disturb the success that America offered certainly would not be welcomed, that’s for sure. I think there are few parts of American foreign policy that have worked as well as being an honest broker in the run-up to the Good Friday Agreement, so we take great satisfaction in what happened and undoing it for a problem that appears as though the British government got themselves into, I think would be a step backwards.”In addition to Mr Neal, two other Irish-Americans – Brendan Boyle of Pennsylvania and New York congressman Brian Higgins – are members of the committee.Later, in a speech, Mr Neal commended the Irish Government for the stance it has taken in the Brexit negotiations. “The way that the Irish government has remained so firm on that border is so gratifying to us here,” he said, noting that all parties in Ireland and Northern Ireland except one were unified on the issue.“It is extraordinary that that border has been as successful as it has been and there might even be a debate about going back to checkpoints,” he said.Former congressman Bruce Morrison also warned Britain about the difficulties ahead in negotiating a trade agreement with the United States – a key priority for Brexiteers who have pointed to their ability to negotiate a future trade deal with the United States, and other non-EU countries, as a key economic benefit of leaving the EU customs union. The US is Britain’s main trading partner outside the EU bloc, and exports to the US are worth an estimated 100 billion pounds to the British economy each year.“I think the British have made a lot of assumptions about trade agreements with the US and with other countries and frankly, from a hard-headed economic standpoint, dealing with the EU is a lot more important than dealing with Britain, so I think they have an uphill slog on that,” Mr Morrison said. “They’ve been talking to themselves and not talking to others in thinking how great it’s going to be to be out of the European Union.”Face-to-face meetingThe intervention from Capitol Hill came hours after Mr Coveney held his first face-to-face meeting with US secretary of state Mike Pompeo at an event in the US State Department, at which the Minister for Foreign Affairs discussed the need to protect the peace process in the context of Brexit.But Mr Coveney stressed that Ireland was not asking the United States to “take sides” amid increasing concern among the Irish-American caucus on Capitol Hill about the implications of Brexit on the Belfast Agreement.“I made it very clear to him that we’re not asking the US to take sides – Ireland over the UK or UK over Ireland,” Mr Coveney said. “But we are asking people here to think about a peace process that they have been very much involved in creating and sustaining, and using influence to ensure that decisions that are taken in relation to Brexit don’t undermine that progress.”Nonetheless, he said that Mr Pompeo, as well as representatives of other nations attending the global coalition against Isis on Wednesday, had discussed Brexit. “Obviously there have been a lot of questions today from US voices, but also many of the other ministers who were here today for the conference, all asking the same questions – where is this going, how can we avoid a no deal Brexit.”Mr Coveney’s visit continues on Thursday with bilateral meetings with member of Congress about Brexit and its implications for the border with Northern Ireland.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Stefan RousseauPA Wire Europhile Labour MPs have rounded on their party leader, Jeremy Corbyn, after he offered to support Theresa May’s Brexit deal in exchange for significant concessions.Mr Corbyn wrote to the British prime minister on Wednesday evening, saying that Labour would support her agreement with the EU if the non-binding political declaration were changed towards a softer Brexit.“We recognise that any negotiation with the EU will require flexibility and compromise,” the opposition leader wrote.His five proposed changes include keeping the UK in a customs union with the EU, something that Mrs May has repeatedly refused to countenance because it would curtail the UK’s ability to sign trade deals. However, the tone of Mr Corbyn’s letter – and his willingness to accept the withdrawal agreement, with its controversial backstop to avoid a hard Irish border – deepened anger among Europhile backbenchers.Chuka Umunna, one of the main Labour backers of a second Brexit referendum, said Mr Corbyn’s letter was “totally demoralising”.“This is not opposition, it is the facilitation of a deal which will make this country poorer,” he said.Chris Leslie, another Labour backbencher, said Mr Corbyn had put Labour’s conference policy, which potentially includes support for options such as a second referendum, “in the bin”.Lucy Powell, a Labour MP who backs membership of the customs union and single market, said Mr Corbyn had made “a really significant move to break the Brexit paralysis”.Brussels meetingMPs on all sides of the Brexit debate are awaiting the outcome of Mrs May’s meeting with Jean-Claude Juncker, the European Commission president, on Thursday.The prime minister has so far failed to specify what alternative arrangements might replace the backstop, the insurance mechanism that Eurosceptics fear would trap the UK in a customs union with the EU. She has mooted a time limit to the backstop and a unilateral exit mechanism, options that have been previously rejected by Brussels.The EU has, however, indicated its willingness to amend the political declaration if the UK’s red lines change.With just 50 days until the scheduled date of Britain’s exit from the EU, Europhile MPs are running out of time to influence the process. They are expected to table motions next week, calling for an extension of article 50, the EU’s formal exit process, and also propose that parliament hold Brexit debates in which MPs could vote on different ways forward.Similar motions, put down by Labour’s Yvette Cooper and the Conservative Dominic Grieve respectively, failed last week, partly due to rebellions by more than 25 Labour MPs. None of the eight shadow ministers who rebelled was sacked from Mr Corbyn’s cabinet.Europhile MPs and some trade unions now suspect the Labour leader is manoeuvring to allow Mrs May’s deal to pass parliament, without Labour taking political responsibility for it.Along with a permanent customs union, the other Brexit demands made by Mr Corbyn are: close alignment with the single market a pledge to keep workers’ rights in line with those in the EU commitments on UK participation in EU agencies and “unambiguous agreements” on future security arrangements, including “access to the European Arrest Warrant”. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2019Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Video: Reuters\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tVirginia governor-elect Ralph Northam (centre) celebrates with lieutenant governor-elect Justin Fairfax and attorney general Mark Herring at Mr Northam’s election night rally in Fairfax, Virginia, in November 2017. All three men are fighting for their political lives. Photograph:  Aaron P BernsteinReutersThe political crisis in Virginia deepened on Wednesday when the attorney general admitted to wearing blackface in the 1980s at a college party, becoming the state’s third high-ranking Democrat caught up in scandal.Attorney general Mark Herring (57), who has expressed gubernatorial ambitions and called four days ago for Mr Northam to resign, admitted in a statement he donned brown face paint at a party in 1980 to impersonate a rapper.Mr Northam (59) acknowledged last weekend to having worn blackface – a practice dating to 19th century minstrel shows caricaturing slaves – in 1984 to impersonate Michael Jackson. His admission came after a conservative media website published a photo on Friday from Mr Northam’s page in his 1984 medical school yearbook showing one man wearing blackface beside another masked figure in robes of the white supremacist group the Ku Klux Klan. After initially saying he was one of the two depicted in the photo, Mr Northam changed his story and said neither was him.A separate scandal engulfing Democratic lieutenant governor Justin Fairfax (39), who is black and would succeed Mr Northam were he to step down, intensified on Wednesday when a woman accused him of sexually assaulting her at the Democratic National Convention in 2004.Mr Herring, who like Mr Northam is white, is second in line to succeed the governor as attorney general.Republican twistThe simultaneous controversies embroiling the top three-elected politicians in the executive branch of Virginia’s government raised the unlikely prospect of Democrats losing the governorship to a Republican. Kirk Cox, Republican speaker of Virginia’s House of Delegates, is third in the constitutional line of succession.Mr Cox (61), a former high school teacher who has served in the state’s Republican-controlled House since 1990, issued a statement on Wednesday saying the controversies in the executive branch “are disturbing” but “will be resolved in due course”. In the meantime, lawmakers would focus on budget deliberations and “hundreds of bills remaining before us”.Legislators otherwise kept a low profile on Wednesday, ducking reporters as they left the state capitol in Richmond following Wednesday’s legislative session.Mr Northam has remained out of public view since Saturday, when he held a news conference to address the furore over his yearbook pictures, which sparked calls for his resignation from fellow Democrats in Virginia, a key swing state in the 2020 presidential race.Civil rights groups and at least five Democratic candidates for the White House also have urged Mr Northam to step down.Despite the Democratic Party’s current zero tolerance for bigotry and sexual misconduct, Democrats might be motivated to rally behind Mr Northam if faced with the prospect of Republicans suddenly assuming the governorship.In his statement, Mr Cox singled out the allegations against Fairfax as “extremely serious”. The lieutenant governor has acknowledged knowing his accuser but on Wednesday repeated his assertion their encounter was consensual.The woman, Vanessa Tyson, in a statement issued by Washington law firm Katz, Marshall \u0026amp Banks, said that Fairfax forced her to perform oral sex on him in a hotel room.“I cannot believe, given my obvious distress, that Mr Fairfax thought this forced sexual act was consensual,” Ms Tyson said in the statement, which was published by multiple US media outlets.The same website that disclosed Mr Northam’s yearbook photo was the first to report Ms Tyson’s allegations on Monday.RespectAfter she came forward, Mr Fairfax again denied wrongdoing but asked that she be treated with respect. “But I cannot agree with a description of events that I know is not true,” he said in a statement.Elected officials in both parties have recently seen their careers ended by allegations of racism and sexual misconduct.Florida’s Republican secretary of state last month resigned after a newspaper published a photo of him wearing blackface at a 2005 costume party.Democratic US senator Al Franken resigned in 2017 after being accused of sexual misconduct.Attorney general Mr Herring said in a statement on Wednesday he now realised he showed poor judgement by dressing as a rapper and donning a wig and brown make-up to perform a song with similarly attired friends.“I had a callous and inexcusable lack of awareness and insensitivity to the pain my behaviour could inflict on others,” he said. – Reuters"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2017/10/12/TELEMMGLPICT000140439032_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"parliament accused conflict interest rejects nda debate","story":"John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, refused to allow Maria Miller to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerfulHouse of CommonsMaria Miller, the Tory MP, last night accused Parliament of a conflict of interest over Britain\u0027s MeToo scandal after it emerged she had been blocked from questioning the Government over it.The Daily  can reveal John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, yesterday refused to allow Ms Miller, who chairs the women \u0026amp equalities Commons select committee, to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerful, including the Topshop tycoon Sir Philip Green.Helen Jones, chairman of the petitions select committee, also rejected calls to allow a parliamentary debate on non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) after two separate petitions demanding a change to the law between them secured 250,000 signatures. It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward. I can\u0027t imagine celebrities would want to be associated with Philip Green. He\u0027s in a tricky situation.

The Maduro regime must LET THE AID REACH THE STARVING PEOPLE. #EstamosUnidosVE”John Bolton, the US national security adviser, echoed his comments, and lashed out at Mr Maduro for seeking only to look after himself.“Maduro and his cronies live lavishly in Europe and enrich their Cuban patrons while plundering Venezuela’s wealth,” he said. “Meanwhile, they are physically blocking the Venezuelan people, including the military rank and file, from receiving humanitarian assistance.”He said the US would protect any senior military official who accepts Mr Guaido’s legitimacy.“The US will consider sanctions off-ramps for any Venezuelan senior military officer that stands for democracy and recognizes the constitutional government of President Juan Guaido,” he said. “If not, the international financial circle will be closed off completely. Make the right choice!”Mr Maduro, increasingly isolated, has sought to sell off the country’s gold reserves to keep his regime afloat. The Bank of England, which holds $1.2 billion in Venezuelan gold, has blocked him from doing so, but Mr Maduro\u0027s government last year sold 73 tonnes of gold to Turkey and the United Arab Emirates without the required approval of the opposition-led national assembly, an opposition politician said on Wednesday.Nicolas Maduro, pictured inspecting troops on MondayCarlos Paparoni also said that Mr Maduro\u0027s administration had transferred 127 million euros to bank accounts in Russia, without specifying when. Since Monday, the Venezuelan government has not been able to move money between its accounts in banks in the European Union, he added.We will keep working so that not one more gram of gold can be sold, Mr Paparoni said.The FBI raided a bank in Puerto Rico on Wednesday, on suspicion of the bank breaking sanctions placed on senior members of Mr Maduro’s government.And the aid delivery represents the latest attempt by Mr Maduro\u0027s political rival, 35-year-old national assembly president Mr Guaido, to weaken the Venezuelan regime by forcing members of the military to disobey Mr Maduro\u0027s orders.Mr Guaido on Tuesday met with former cabinet members of the late Hugo Chavez to discuss the way out of the impasse. He also met with mayors of Venezuelan cities to discuss distributing the aid.Venezuelan opposition leaders, who have gathered in Cucuta, appealed to the Venezuelan military to allow safe passage for the aid trucks.You know there\u0027s a red line, you know well there\u0027s a limit, you know that medicines, food and medical supplies are that limit, said Miguel Pizarro, a pro-Guaido politician.Tents and other logistical supplies have begun to arrive in Cucuta, but the bulk of the 60 tons of aid remains in the Colombian capital, Bogota. Local officials suggested the arrival may be delayed until the border crossing is cleared, or until both sides have negotiated an agreement to let the aid pass.The United Nations and the Red Cross expressed alarm on Wednesday about the politicisation of aid.Humanitarian action needs to be independent of political, military or other objectives, said Stephane Dujarric, UN spokesman, speaking in New York.When we see the present stand-off it becomes even more clear that serious political negotiations between the parties are necessary to find a solution leading to lasting peace for the people of Venezuela.Mr Guaido wrote to UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres last month asking for help in tackling the country\u0027s crisis. But Venezuela\u0027s seat at the 193-member world body is held by Mr Maduro\u0027s government and Mr Guterres is unable to ramp up a humanitarian response in Venezuela without Maduro\u0027s approval or UN Security Council authorisation – something which would be blocked by Russia and China.In Geneva, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said it was doubling its resources to cope with the crisis, where food and medicine shortages have pushed 2.3 million people to flee since 2015.Our focus is really to, on the one side increase our response to Venezuelans, and on the other hand to keep away from the political controversy and political isions which are characteristic to the crisis in Venezuela, said Peter Maurer, ICRC chief.Juan Guaido, the man recognised by Britain, the US and dozens of other nations as the rightful interim president of VenezuelaWalter Marquez, a former member of Venezuela´s national assembly, told The  that the refusal to allow the entry of food and medicines contravenes international law.“The UN must assume its responsibility to protect the people of Venezuela,” he said. “The International Criminal Court has the power to take preventative measures and that´s what we´d like to see.”Mr Maduro has said repeatedly that the arrival of humanitarian aid would be the start of a US-led invasion, insisting that no one will enter, not one invading soldier.”Mr Marquez denied that the Venezuelan opposition hoped to provoke military intervention, but he said he was pessimistic about the chances of a peaceful solution.“I don\u0027t see how negotiations will work,” he said. “They will have to use force to get the aid in.Sign up for your essential, twice-daily briefing from The  with our free Front Page newsletter.Please review our commenting policyBrexit latest news: UK and EU locked in Brexit stalemate after Theresa May and Jean-Claude Juncker refuse to budge in crunch talksComment: The 3 choices the PM now faces are simple: betray your people, betray Northern Ireland, or leave without a dealCan Mrs May learn the lessons of her past failures in Brussels?GP surgeries to be provided with in-house lawyers for patients Comment: The EU has a special place in hell for Mrs May: doing a Brexit deal with the Labour devilComment: The backlash against Turning Point UK rather proves its point it\u0026#39s hard being a conservative on campusLibby Squire: Man, 24, arrested on suspicion of abduction in connection with missing Hull studentWhat is the Brexit backstop, and why is the Irish border so important to the deal?The EU is furious with Theresa May and will leave her empty-handed -

To lure her away, Apple gave Ahrendts company stock valued at $70 million in 2014. In her last full year at Apple, she received a compensation package valued at $26.5 million, according to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\u0026nbspAhrendts’ arrival at the Cupertino, California, company coincided with the rollout of the Apple Watch, which the company designed to be a fashion statement in addition to a wearable piece of technology.\u0026nbspWhile at Apple, Ahrendts engineered renovations of high-profiles stores in San Francisco, New York, Chicago and other cities in an attempt to transform them into hip places to hang out while shoppers checked out the company’s latest innovations. Her lofty description of the stores as the equivalent of “town squares” became the subject of derision among some analysts and media commentators.Additional reporting by Associated PressBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

In the same sitting, MPs also voted against a no-deal Brexit in a non-legally binding motionIn November the Bank had expected business investment to grow by 2 per cent in 2019. Now it expects a fall of 2.75 per cent. Its 2020 forecast is also slashed from 5 per cent to 2.75 per cent.As expected by markets, the Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted to keep interest rates unchanged at 0.75 per cent. The markets are currently pricing in no rate hike until the middle of 2020. In December they had priced in one quarter point increase in 2019 and another in 2020. With the Bank’s inflation forecast broadly unchanged by the end of the forecast period from November, anticipated at\u0026nbsp 2.1 per cent in Q1 2021, markets are likely to take the latest inflation projections as a signal that the MPC is in no hurry to raise rates.The Bank’s 2020 GDP growth rate is also reduced to 1.5 per cent, down from 1.7 per cent previously, although it has pencilled in a recovery to 1.9 per cent in 2021 if Brexit is smooth and the UK is safely in the transition period.Emphasising how much damage Brexit has already done to business investment, which accounts for around 10 per cent of UK GDP, the Bank noted that the post-2008 recovery in firms’ spending had “stalled” since the 2015 referendum act was passed.The Bank also published some modelling which suggests that if uncertainty fell and financial conditions across the economy improved UK GDP growth could be lifted to 1.6 per cent this year and 2.2 per cent in 2020.The latest report from the Bank’s network of regional agents relates that around half of the 200 firms questioned said they are “not ready” for a no-deal Brexit, even though most had a contingency plan in place.In the near term, the Bank expects growth in the final quarter of 2018 to have been 0.3 per cent and to decline to 0.2 per cent in the first quarter of 2019. This opens around a small amount of slack (0.25 per cent of GDP) in the economy according to the Bank.The Bank re-iterated its warning that, in the wake of no-deal Brexit, interest rates could move in either direction, depending on MPC estimates of the extent of damage to demand and supply, although many analysts think that the Bank would be more likely to cut rates to support spending in such circumstances.“The economic outlook will continue to depend significantly on the nature of the EU withdrawal,” said the Bank. “In particular: the new trading arrangements between the European Union and the United Kingdom, whether the transition to them is abrupt or smooth, and how households, businesses and financial markets respond.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That forecast in the Bank’s latest Inflation Report is down sharply from the 1.7 per cent growth it estimated in November and would be the feeblest performance since GDP plummeted by 1.4 per cent in 2009.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialIt also sees a roughly one in four probability of a recession in the second half of 2019.\u0026nbsp“This slowdown mainly reflects softer activity abroad and the greater effects from Brexit uncertainties at home,” said the Bank, admitting that business investment had been considerably weaker than it previously anticipated due to fears over a Brexit cliff-edge for trade.Yet the Bank stressed that even this much weaker outlook was conditioned on a “smooth adjustment” to life outside the EU.

In the same sitting, MPs also voted against a no-deal Brexit in a non-legally binding motionIn November the Bank had expected business investment to grow by 2 per cent in 2019. Now it expects a fall of 2.75 per cent. Its 2020 forecast is also slashed from 5 per cent to 2.75 per cent.As expected by markets, the Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted to keep interest rates unchanged at 0.75 per cent. The markets are currently pricing in no rate hike until the middle of 2020. In December they had priced in one quarter point increase in 2019 and another in 2020. With the Bank’s inflation forecast broadly unchanged by the end of the forecast period from November, anticipated at\u0026nbsp 2.1 per cent in Q1 2021, markets are likely to take the latest inflation projections as a signal that the MPC is in no hurry to raise rates.The Bank’s 2020 GDP growth rate is also reduced to 1.5 per cent, down from 1.7 per cent previously, although it has pencilled in a recovery to 1.9 per cent in 2021 if Brexit is smooth and the UK is safely in the transition period.Emphasising how much damage Brexit has already done to business investment, which accounts for around 10 per cent of UK GDP, the Bank noted that the post-2008 recovery in firms’ spending had “stalled” since the 2015 referendum act was passed.The Bank also published some modelling which suggests that if uncertainty fell and financial conditions across the economy improved UK GDP growth could be lifted to 1.6 per cent this year and 2.2 per cent in 2020.The latest report from the Bank’s network of regional agents relates that around half of the 200 firms questioned said they are “not ready” for a no-deal Brexit, even though most had a contingency plan in place.In the near term, the Bank expects growth in the final quarter of 2018 to have been 0.3 per cent and to decline to 0.2 per cent in the first quarter of 2019. This opens around a small amount of slack (0.25 per cent of GDP) in the economy according to the Bank.The Bank re-iterated its warning that, in the wake of no-deal Brexit, interest rates could move in either direction, depending on MPC estimates of the extent of damage to demand and supply, although many analysts think that the Bank would be more likely to cut rates to support spending in such circumstances.“The economic outlook will continue to depend significantly on the nature of the EU withdrawal,” said the Bank. “In particular: the new trading arrangements between the European Union and the United Kingdom, whether the transition to them is abrupt or smooth, and how households, businesses and financial markets respond.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They are the ones who think, rightly or wrongly, that the future has been made more difficult for them.“The more highly skilled you are, the better your life chances. It is a very rational thing that young people are doing.”James Seymour, director of admissions at the University of Buckingham, said: “Although there’s lots of uncertainty around Brexit there’s a feeling of certainty when it comes to doing a degree in the UK.“There’s a feeling of ‘it’s my choice’ regardless of what is going on with Brexit. There have been some question marks over apprenticeships but people feel they can trust a degree.”Clare Marchant, chief executive of Ucas, said: In this time of uncertainty, it\u0027s welcome news to see more EU and international students wanting to come and study in the UK.Alongside this, demand from UK 18-year-old students remains strong, despite the falling numbers of this age group in the population.The unexpected rise in the application rate from English 18-year-olds, against the population trend, signals they still recognise the challenge and rewards of full-time undergraduate study.Alistair Jarvis, chief executive of Universities UK, said: It\u0027s excellent to see that 18-year-olds in England increasingly value a university education, with a record rate of applications.We are also pleased to see a record high in the percentage of young people from disadvantaged areas applying to university.However, we need to be more ambitious. To retain a competitive advantage on the global stage post-Brexit we must encourage and support more of the population through higher level study.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

William Cook travels to Brussels to meet the famous duo, who have\u0026nbspturned their lives together into a perpetual, seamless artworkClick to followThe IndependentGilbert and George outside their house in Spitalfields: ‘We really believe that Fournier Street is the centre of the world for us’In a dilapidated old arsenal on the industrial edge of Brussels, Gilbert and George are singing the music hall song that made them famous. Their audience seem a bit bemused, and who on earth can blame them? “Underneath the Arches” is as British as warm\u0026nbspbeer or test match cricket, and equally incomprehensible to European punters. First performed by a very different duo, Flanagan and Allen, way back in the 1930s, it was already a golden oldie when Gilbert and George started singing it in art galleries 50 years ago.Half a century later, it’s become the theme tune for their lifelong career as Living Sculptures. No wonder these continental liggers are nonplussed. To anyone who isn’t steeped in British culture, with its weird passion for nostalgia, Gilbert and George must seem very odd indeed. “We never wanted to be weird because all artists like the idea of being weird, and we never wanted to be normal because everybody’s normal,” says George, by way of explanation. “We like to be weird and normal at the same time.”Gilbert and George are here in Brussels to open Brafa, one of Europe’s most prestigious art fairs. Each year, a famous artist is invited to be Brafa’s guest of honour. Last year, it was Christo. This year, it’s Gilbert and George. Their big bold artworks are scattered around this huge hall, an incongruous contrast to the antique paintings that surround them.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialThis juxtaposition is surreal – and here in the Belgian capital, the city of Magritte, that’s really rather fitting. For Brexit-obsessed Britons, Brussels may be synonymous with the European Union, but for Europeans it’s always been synonymous with surrealism – and what could possibly be more surreal than Gilbert and George?Despite their matching suits, and shirts and ties, they’re easy to tell apart. George looks like Eric Morecambe. Gilbert looks like Ernie Wise. However, unlike Eric and Ernie, they’re more than just a double act. They live together, they work together, they always appear in public together. This has been their way of life since they met, in London, in 1967, at St Martin’s School of Art (now Central Saint Martins). Their artworks are striking, and often bizarrely beautiful, but they’re a sideshow compared to their greatest work of art: themselves.Created with Sketch.Gilbert and George: portraits and works Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Gilbert and George in their local cafe in Spitalfields, 2017Gilbert and George outside of their favourite restaurant, Mangal II, a Kurdish restaurant in Stoke Newington 2017 Portrait of Gilbert and George RA after receiving their medals at the Royal Academy of Arts on May 2, 2017Portrait of Gilbert and George RA after receiving their medals at the Royal Academy of Arts on May 2, 2017Gilbert and George, 2015Gilbert and George in their younger yearsGilbert and George - SFG (2013)Gilbert \u0026amp George, White Cube and Albert BaronianGilbert and George - HANDBALL (2008)Gilbert \u0026amp George, White Cube and Albert BaronianGilbert and George - TEACHER STRAIGHT (2011)Gilbert \u0026amp George, White Cube and Albert BaronianGilbert and George - BEARD RAIDS (2016) Gilbert \u0026amp George, White Cube and Albert BaronianGilbert and George - BEARD MAD (2016)Gilbert \u0026amp George, White Cube and Albert BaronianGilbert and George, 2017Early morning.

Everyone assumes so, but no one seems to know for sure, and their public life is far more intriguing than whatever they might get up to in private. Young men feature prominently in their work, women are conspicuous by their absence, but you wouldn’t call these pictures homoerotic. Indeed, there’s something strangely sexless about them, like artworks from another planet.Their\u0026nbspDirty Words\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspNaked Shit\u0026nbsppictures caused a predictable furore (the titles are self-explanatory) but most of their work isn’t overtly controversial. The most radical thing about them isn’t their art, but the way they’ve merged their inidual identities into one.‘Fake’ Hitler paintings seized by German police in BerlinThey’re reluctant to discuss the details of their lives before they met, but their backgrounds are fascinating. When pressed, they stress the similarities – they were both war babies from provincial, lower-class, unartistic families – but the differences are far more notable, and the most notable difference is that one half of this very British duo wasn’t originally British at all.Gilbert Prousch was born in a small village in the Italian Dolomites in 1943. His father was a shoemaker, like his grandfather, great-grandfather and great-great grandfather before him, but after the war mass-produced shoes became much cheaper and so Gilbert’s father struggled to make a living. Inspired by Michaelangelo, Gilbert studied art in Salzburg and then in Munich, where he heard about St Martin’s. He travelled to London and wangled a place on its internationally renowned advanced sculpture course. He didn’t speak a word of English. He still speaks with a strong Italian accent today.George Passmore, conversely, speaks like a BBC newsreader from the 1950s. He was born in Devon in 1942. His father left home soon after George was born, possibly before. His mother was uninhibited, and George had a succession of “uncles”, which must have exposed him to gossip in postwar Totnes. At state school he showed a talent for art, which eventually won him a place at Dartington Hall, a private school renowned for its progressive attitudes. Inspired by Van Gogh’s letters, he went on to art school, and ended up at St Martin’s, on the advanced sculpture course, with Gilbert Prousch.“George took an interest in me,” says Gilbert. They became friends – and then lovers? Last time I met them, in their home in London, I asked them if it was love at first sight. “No,” said George. He described their relationship as something that happened gradually, “like an atmosphere or a cloud”. Do they ever wonder what might have happened if they’d never met? The idea clearly seems inconceivable to them. They believe they were destined to be together. “It was fate,” says Gilbert.The sculpture course at St Martin’s was (in)famously laissez-faire. Students could do whatever they wanted, which suited Gilbert and George just fine. “St Martin’s was the best art school in the world,” says Gilbert. “This was a school that said to an artist, ‘Anything goes. You are free to think in different ways.’ No other art school did that.” His art training in Munich had been traditional and academic. “St Martin’s was different – anything could be art.”Their fellow students included Barry Flanagan, Bruce McLean and, most notably, Richard Long, who turned walking into an artform. Gilbert and George went even further. They turned their lives together into a perpetual, seamless artwork. As Gilbert says, “We were the centre of our art.”While Long set off into the wilderness, Gilbert and George wandered around London’s East End. It was here, in a Dickensian junk shop, that they found an old record of “Underneath the Arches”, and came up with the idea of singing along to it, for hours and hours on end. They called this artwork The Singing Sculpture. “We felt we were doing something different,” says Gilbert. Like all the best ideas, it was both in keeping with, yet contrary to, the spirit of the times. Conceptual art was all the rage, but most of it was terribly earnest. Their Singing Sculpture was full of fun.Brafa, one of Europe’s most prestigious art fairs\u0026nbsp(Fabrice Debatty)“For the artists who were showing in those galleries, colour was taboo, figuration was taboo, sex was taboo, feeling was taboo – and these were all of the things we were interested in,” says George. Other artists got drunk in the evening, then went back into the studio in the morning to make sombre, sober art. Gilbert and George turned their drunken revels into art.They couldn’t get any public subsidy, and they had no family money to support them. Looking back, they now believe this gave them an advantage. “We could feel more free – we didn’t have to fit in in any way,” says George. “Middle-class people are more constrained.”They got their big break at a group show in London called When Attitudes Become Form. When the curator declined to include their work they gatecrashed the private view, and stole the show with their Living Sculptures, standing in the middle of the gallery like showroom dummies. Konrad Fischer saw them at this show, and asked them to perform in Düsseldorf. In Düsseldorf they were seen by Illeana Sonnabend, who invited them to New York. Fischer and Sonnabend were two of the world’s most influential art dealers. Gilbert and George had arrived.Around the same time they moved into a Georgian townhouse in Fournier Street, in London’s Spitalfields. They’ve lived there ever since. It was a poor area when they moved in. It’s got a lot smarter since, but it’s still a tough old place. The tramps that used to live there have been replaced by drug addicts, but they don’t mind this shifting cityscape – they embrace it. “We are very optimistic people,” says George. “We are never against anything.”Like a lot of their boldest statements, this is only partly true. They were certainly against the artistic orthodoxy of the 1960s and 1970s. In their suits and ties and starched white shirts they stood out a mile. “To be an artist you had to be critical. You had to be against the bomb, or against America, or against the Conservatives or against Labour,” says George. “We thought, ‘How marvellous it would be if we didn’t have to be Anti!’” It’s a philosophy they maintain when people bring petitions to their front door. “If it’s for something, we sign it. If it’s against something, we don’t sign it. We must have signed for some horrible things, but at least we were for.”Living in Spitalfields has been absolutely central to their art. “We really believe that Fournier Street is the centre of the world for us,” Gilbert tells me. “It’s an amazing mixture of different kinds of people.” Spitalfields has long been a refuge for arriving immigrants: Huguenots, Jews, Sikhs, Muslims… “The East End of London is a mixture of so many countries, a mixture of so many different people.” This is just the way they like it. “You face the modern world whenever you step out of the front door,” says George.They’ve exhibited all around the world, but though their pictures attract a lot of interest, wherever they go the main attraction is always Gilbert and George. It’s the same story here in Brussels. It’s like attending a press conference with Quentin Crisp and Oscar Wilde. Sure, it’s the same show every time, more or less, endless variations on a single theme, but it’s still more entertaining and enlightening than talking to any other artists I can think of.They set off for a walk around Brafa, followed by a swarm of hacks. “Our motto is ban religion,” says Gilbert, as they pause for photos in front of one of their monumental pictures. Religion loomed large in both their childhoods: Gilbert was raised a Catholic George’s brother became a vicar. Their artworks are oddly reminiscent of stained glass windows, but they’re both devout atheists. “We don’t believe in God,” says Gilbert. “All the gods are manmade. We are in charge of what we are doing in this world.”“We’ve always firmly believed that the national galleries of the world should remove all of the Christian art and hand it back to the Church,” says George. “They can look after the insurance and maintenance and conservation, and give over the national museums to humanist art, not Judeo-Christian voodoo.” George tells a story about an elderly vicar who knocked on their front door. “I thought it was marvellous that you said Ban Religion,” he told them. “My congregation come to church every week, and they’re all very religious. But I don’t want them to be religious. I want them to be good.”“We believe in the enlightenment, when people became human for their own sake,” adds Gilbert. “They didn’t need God anymore to make themselves human.” Their heroes are Charles Darwin and Alan Turing.We stop in front of a montage they made from tabloid posters, which they stole from outside newsagents. “It’s not a very easy thing to do because the shopkeepers don’t like you to do that, so one of us would go into the shop to distract the shopkeeper while the other stole the poster,” confesses George. “After three and a half years we ended up with more than 3,700 posters, and then we ided them into subjects – the ones which said Rape, the ones that said Murder, the ones that said Mugged, and ended up with a very big group of pictures.” They only got caught once. “We were very polite and gave it back to the shop, but we went the next night and stole it again.”‘Honest posters’ take down this year’s Oscar nomineesMan mistaken for employee strolls out of art gallery with $1m paintingThe rise of graphic novels, from To Kill a Mockingbird to SabrinaDespite these rebellious attitudes, they’re reassuringly old-fashioned. They don’t use the internet, or mobile phones. The only time they use the telephone is to book a table at the local restaurant where they’ve eaten for the past 20 years. After 50 years in the spotlight, they still maintain they’re outside the art establishment.Maybe they were, once upon a time (when they met, in 1967, homosexuality had only just been decriminalised) but that time has long since passed. Today they’re Royal Academicians who’ve exhibited in virtually every major gallery across the globe. If they were ever anti-establishment, the establishment has long since absorbed them. Yet for all their success there’s still something discreetly anarchic about them, a hint of danger behind their impeccable manners and immaculately tailored suits.They’re now lionised by the art world, but they don’t like hobnobbing with other artists. “We had friends in London, Paris, Germany, New York, a huge group of friends – drinking, celebrating, parties – and then one day we cut it off, we stopped,” says George. “We realised it was all to do with gossip and business – the nightmare of a world that has nothing to do with being an artist.” “We wanted to be free of gossiping,” says Gilbert. “We have friends, but we don’t want artist friends.” Though the art world has appropriated them, and sanctified them, they’re still outsiders at heart.So what advice would they give to an aspiring young artist starting out today? “Tomorrow morning, when you wake up, sit on the edge of your bed, keep your eyes closed, and don’t open them and stand up until you have decided, ‘What do I want to say to the world today?’” says George. Gilbert’s advice is a lot more succinct: “Fuck the teachers.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Rosalind the rover captures this spirit and carries us all to the forefront of space exploration.”Rosalind Franklin was central to the discovery of DNA, alongside\u0026nbspCrick and Watson, but her part in the work has been historically overlooked. She was not mentioned when Crick, Watson and Wilkins were awarded the Nobel Prize in 1962 for their work on DNA, and her name was left out of many science books until the 1990s – but in recent years there has been a major effort to recognise her part in the pioneering work.The lander has already had its landing site chosen ahead of its touchdown in 2021. The area is thought to have once been covered in a large lake, and scientists hope that signatures of life might be lying there.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It is unlikely the pair will ever be heard from again.It has been more than a month since the robots were last heard from and they are now millions of miles beyond the red planet.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialBut Nasa considers the very fact it could talk to them at all a major success. The two craft pushed up against the limits of experimental technology, they say, and helped prove concepts that could allow such tiny robots to venture even more deep into space.MarCO was th first interplanetary mission to use a class of small spacecraft known as\u0026nbspCubeSats. Together, the pair worked as communications relays during the landing of InSight, a Nasa rover that dropped down around New Year and will be delving deep into Mars\u0027s surface.The two spacecraft were able to beam back data during the descent of the lander in near real-time, and sent back the stunning first images that were taken by InSight. The craft even did some science of their own: WALL-E took its own photos, and EVE did some simple radio science.Because the technology was experimental, Nasa weren\u0027t relying on either of the CubeSats working at all. If they had broken on their way – as engineers suspected they might – the data would still have been sent back but it would have taken much longer to receive it.After their work was done at Mars, they carried on off into space. WALL-E hasn\u0027t sent a message since 29 December, and is thought to be more than a million miles past Mars EVE is even further away, at about two million miles, and hasn\u0027t spoken to Nasa since 4 January.Nasa\u0027s Mars InSight lander sends back stunning first selfieResearchers don\u0027t know exactly why the pair have lost touch. WALL-E has a leaky thruster and might be wobbling so that it can\u0027t send commands. The sensors that allow them to charge their batteries from the sun might also have broken.They will continue flying away from Earth as February goes on, making sending any data\u0026nbspever more difficult and so meaning that Nasa don\u0027t expect to ever hear back.This mission was always about pushing the limits of miniaturized technology and seeing just how far it could take us, said Andy Klesh, the mission\u0027s chief engineer at JPL. We\u0027ve put a stake in the ground. Future CubeSats might go even farther.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s most stunning pictures of space Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.130 Earth from the ISSFrom the International Space Station, Expedition 42 Flight Engineer Terry W.

Sterling fell 0.45 per cent against the dollar to hit £1.2874 and dropped 0.13 per cent against the euro to €1.1365.The central bank’s monetary policy committee voted unanimously to hold interest rates at 0.75 per cent but warned that Brexit uncertainty will slash UK economic growth in 2019 to the weakest rate since the global financial crisis a decade ago even if the UK manages to secure an orderly departure from the European Union next month.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialThe central bank now expects growth in 2019 to come in at only 1.2 per cent, driven by slumping business investment.Threadneedle Street also sees a roughly one in four probability of a recession in the second half of 2019. “This slowdown mainly reflects softer activity abroad and the greater effects from Brexit uncertainties at home,” said the Bank, admitting that business investment had been considerably weaker than it previously anticipated due to fears over a Brexit cliff-edge for trade.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Ben Chu looks at the possible consequencesClick to followThe IndependentSupermarkets may sell only to British-based customers but around 30 per cent of our food is imported from the EUThe Brexit media spotlight has, for understandable reasons, tended to shine on exporting firms and major manufacturers with just-in-time supply chains, such as Nissan.These businesses are clearly at severe risk from the impact of a no-deal Brexit because they would suddenly face EU tariffs or import delivery problems that could shatter their ability to function.But what about UK firms that don’t export or manufacture?

What might the impact on them be?For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialThe answer is (as so often): it depends. If these firms rely on imports for their stock they too are severely exposed to any problems at the border. Think of supermarkets and grocers. They may sell only to British-based customers, but around 30 per cent of our food is imported from the European Union.Retailers that source “fast-fashion” clothing items from developing countries\u0026nbspcould also be adversely affected.

Some may have taken out hedges against such currency volatility. But those that haven’t will find their costs rise sharply. Smaller firms, in particular, are much less likely to have hedging protection.Liam Fox, the trade secretary, has this week floated the idea of the government abolishing all import tariffs entirely in a no-deal scenario. This could (notwithstanding delivery delays) mean a surge in the availability of cheap manufactured or produce imports from around the world. Even firms that only serve the UK domestic market and don’t import at all could struggle to cope with this sudden burst of cheaper competition.Another factor for domestic-focused firms to consider is the macroeconomic impact of no deal. If this inflicts a severe shock to the overall UK economy – resulting in lower consumer spending and a slump in investment spending by firms – that would probably hit the sales of most domestic firms, regardless of any border or tariff issues. If a no-deal Brexit harms the financial sector, domestic firms may find it harder to access bank borrowing.These firms could also be hit by a shortage of workers if a no-deal scenario results in an exodus of EU workers. Almost a tenth of workers in the construction sector – 200,000 – are EU-born. In retail, hotels and restaurants the share is 25 per cent.The important thing to remember about the UK economy is that everything is connected – no firm, whatever its main market, is an island.Got an unanswered question about Brexit?

Thus, the post-crash recession of 2008 was less severe than it might have been.Under the Maastricht Treaty of 1992, the UK and Denmark were the\u0026nbsponly EU member states relieved of the requirement to join the euro once certain economic conditions were in place, for example on government borrowing and inflation (the “convergence criteria”).For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialThat treaty was eventually subsumed into the Lisbon Treaty of 2007. The European Commission states: “The treaty does not specify a particular timetable for joining the euro area, but leaves it to member states to develop their own strategies for meeting the condition for euro adoption. Seven of the 13 member states who joined the EU since 2004 have already joined the euro area, most recently Lithuania on 1 January 2015.” The UK and Denmark’s “opt-outs” are still in force.The question now arises, then, of whether this special situation would continue of the Brexit process, under article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, were now paused or revoked (ie reversed).What’s behind the latest Brexit row over Gibraltar?The short answer to that is yes. The UK would remain, as now, a member state under existing terms. Including the euro opt-out.However, if the UK were to formally leave the EU at any point, even under a “soft Brexit” and remaining in the European Economic Area, the single market or customs union, it would still need to reapply for membership in the usual fashion if it wanted to return. Just as, say, Albania or Serbia are now, the UK would become a “candidate” for accession.This would require acceptance of the “acquis communautaire” – all the rules, regulations and laws of the EU as they currently stand. Any exceptions would have to be agreed by the EU.Created with Sketch.

But it is still beautiful, not only geometrically with its lines and curves against the fluidity of the ocean, but also as an emblem of a British seaside culture slowly fading.On the euro, the UK would have lost the opt-out, and be required to fix the pound’s exchange rate irrevocably to the euro, and to transfer the running of UK monetary policy – interest rates – from the Bank of England to the European Central Bank in Frankfurt. There the Bank of England would be represented along with the other central banks.In due course, when the convergence criteria had been met, the UK would then join the euro and abolish the pound, first in bank deposits and then in notes and coins. However, it is interesting that Sweden maintains that it is not obliged to join the euro, and would only do so after a referendum. It has been an EU member since 1994 and still uses the krona.The UK joining the euro would be a controversial question, as it was when it was a live issue in the 1990s.If history is any guide, and with acknowledged flaws in the eurozone’s governance, joining the euro would be a significant obstacle to the UK rejoining the EU, if the EU insisted on enforcing it. Critics would claim it would mean bailing out Greece or Italy at great costs. Supporters would point to how it would make cross-border trade and price transparency much easier.Got an unanswered question about Brexit?

This is why we insist on the backstop.”\u0026nbspMs May has promised to put forward a fresh plan for maintaining an open border in Northern Ireland by next Wednesday, but Mr Tusk warned that any new proposals from the UK must be “believeable”.\u0026nbspHe said: “Give us a believable guarantee for peace in Northern Ireland and the UK will leave the EU as a trusted friend.\u0026nbspLive – EU council president says ‘we will not gamble with peace’“I hope the UK government will present ideas that will both respect this point of view and at the same time command a clear and stable majority in the House of Commons.”His stance was echoed by Mr Varadkar, who said\u0026nbsphe was “open to further discussions” with the UK but that the current withdrawal agreement remained\u0026nbsp”the best deal possible”.He said: “While we expect that the backstop will never be used, we agreed again today that it is needed as a legal guarantee to ensure that there is no return to a hard border on the island of Ireland while protecting the integrity of our European single market and customs union.“I think the events in London and the instability in British politics\u0026nbspin recent weeks demonstrates exactly why we need a legal guarantee and a solution that is operable, that we know will work and will last.”After their joint press conference, microphones recorded Mr Varadkar joking to Mr Tusk: “They’ll give you terrible trouble in the British press.”A laughing Mr Tusk replied: “Yes I know.”The comments sparked a furious response from Brexiteers.Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the Commons, said Mr Tusk has no manners, telling\u0026nbspthe BBC: “I think that what he has said is pretty unacceptable and pretty disgraceful.I\u0027m sure that when he reflects on it he may well wish he hadn\u0027t done it.The DUP’s Sammy Wilson called Mr Tusk a\u0026nbsp”devilish, trident-wielding, euro maniac”, adding: “Donald Tusk once again shows his contempt for the 17.4 million people who voted to escape the corruption of the EU and seek the paradise of a free and prosperous kingdom.

In the end there is only one way out of this mess for both our country and the Labour Party – a People’s Vote.”But speaking on the BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, the party’s shadow international trade secretary Barry Gardiner defended the shift in policy away from the six tests Labour originally set for a Brexit deal, saying the offer was made “in a spirit of co-operation and compromise”.“It’s not about tests now,” he said. “What we are doing is saying we believe that these are the options that are available that would actually secure a majority in the House of Commons.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But if we are able to make progress sooner, then that might not be necessary.“We can’t know at this stage exactly which of those scenarios would happen.”There is\u0026nbspgrowing concern\u0026nbspamong ministers that there is not enough time to pass the necessary legislation before exit day,\u0026nbspamid reports that the February recess could be cancelled to give Ms May more time to win over the EU.Mr Hunt said a solution had “not been properly worked up” to replace the\u0026nbspIrish backstop – which aims to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland.\u0026nbspMPs backed a bid to\u0026nbspreplace it\u0026nbspwith “alternative arrangements” in a series of crunch votes on Tuesday.He said it was “difficult to know” if negotiations would run to the end of March, but added: “Whereas a week ago none of us really knew whether this was going to be possible, we are now in a situation where it clearly is possible.“There are lots and lots of hurdles –\u0026nbspno one is saying this isn’t going to be very challenging –\u0026nbspbut we do now have a consensus in parliament.“Providing we can do that, which I think we can, then I think there is a way through.”However his Austrian counterpart, Karin Kneissl, said it would be “very difficult” for the Brexit timeframe to be extended and warned that Britain could be heading for a no-deal exit.She said: “According to the Article 50 procedures, the deadline is 29 March,\u0026nbspso there is a time pressure because what couldn’t be reached by negotiation over the last years, it’s very difficult to imagine that there can be a tremendous breakthrough – a magic solution – in the next few days in order also to have this ratified in due time for the remaining EU members.”Created with Sketch.

Another key takeaway is they are planning to meet at the end of February, which is dangerously close to exit day on March 29. Are we getting closer to a delay?Read it in full below:Prime Minister May and President Juncker have met today to review the next steps in the UK’s withdrawal from the EU.The talks were held in a spirit of working together to achieve the UK’s orderly withdrawal from the EU, especially in the context of a shared determination to achieve a strong partnership for the future given the global challenges the EU and the UK face together in upholding open and fair trade, cooperation in the fight against climate change and terrorism and defending the rules-based international system.The Prime Minister described the context in the UK Parliament, and the motivation behind last week’s vote in the House of Commons seeking a legally binding change to the terms of the backstop. She raised various options for dealing with these concerns in the context of the Withdrawal Agreement in line with her commitments to the Parliament.President Juncker underlined that the EU27 will not reopen the Withdrawal Agreement, which represents a carefully balanced compromise between the European Union and the UK, in which both sides have made significant concessions to arrive at a deal. President Juncker however expressed his openness to add wording to the Political Declaration agreed by the EU27 and the UK in order to be more ambitious in terms of content and speed when it comes to the future relationship between the European Union and the UK. President Juncker drew attention to the fact that any solution would have to be agreed by the European Parliament and the EU27.The discussion was robust but constructive. Despite the challenges, the two leaders agreed that their teams should hold talks as to whether a way through can be found that would gain the broadest possible support in the UK Parliament and respect the guidelines agreed by the European Council. The Prime Minister and the President will meet again before the end of February to take stock of these discussions.Downing Street confirmed that Jeremy\u0026nbspCorbyn\u0027s letter had been received, and a spokeswoman added: We will reply in due course. Our positions on many of the issues in the letter are well known. Our position on the backstop has not changed.The spokeswoman said that no further meeting between Mrs May and the Labour leader to discuss Brexit had been scheduled, but added that her door is open.Andrea Leadsom\u0026nbspconfirms there will be a debate on Theresa May\u0027s\u0026nbspBrexit deal on Thursday, February 14.The PM will bring a \u0027revised deal\u0027 back to the House for a second meaningful vote \u0027as soon as she can\u0027. If that\u0027s not possible by Feb 13, the government will table an amendable motion on Thursday.\u0026nbspThis comes off the back of a story in the Huffington Post, which revealed roaming charges could be brought overnight for Brits abroad in the event of a no-deal Brexit.\u0026nbspLiam Fox has warned MPs risk making the pitfalls of a no-deal Brexit more likely by voting against the Government\u0027s Withdrawal Agreement.The international trade secretary, asked about processing trade deals with minimal delays, told the Commons: In terms of the continuity of agreements we already have, the best way to ensure full continuity is to have a deal.All those who talk about the pitfalls of no deal would do well to remember that in voting against a deal they make those pitfalls all the more likely.Labour accused Dr Fox of giving away the shop before negotiations start after reports he is planning on scrapping all import tariffs post-Brexit.The cabinet minister replied: The government has made no decision on this, when we do so we will communicate it to stakeholders, the public and Parliament.Of course the best way to avoid this scenario is to have a deal with the European Union and whipping up fear about people\u0027s jobs is simply the humbug that has become the hallmark of Mr Esterson.Theresa May will use talks with European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker, Donald\u0026nbspTusk and other prominent EU figures to press for legally binding guarantees on Irish\u0026nbspbackstop.The backstop, which is intended to prevent the return of a hard border on the island of Ireland, would see the UK continue to obey EU customs rules after a transition period if no wider trade deal had been reached.Downing Street said that the PM will insist that the UK cannot be trapped in the backstop. She is\u0026nbspopen to different ways of achieving her objectives but they must be legally binding.The PM will say parliament has sent an unequivocal message that change is required but MPs have made it clear they can support her deal if the backstop is addressed.David Lidington, the de-facto\u0026nbspdeputy PM, said Donald\u0026nbspTusk\u0027s comment wasn\u0027t the most brilliant diplomacy in the world.He told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today: I think Mr Tusk was venting yesterday, but I don\u0027t think that will detract from what I expect to be a courteous and sensible grown-up discussion between the different EU leaders and the prime minister.Mr Lidington said he and Brexit secretary Steve Barclay want to sit down with Labour frontbenchers but its\u0026nbspkey Brexit policy on a customs union with Brussels was wishful thinking.If it\u0027s Keir Starmer or Emily Thornberry or anybody else, the idea is - if this goes forward - it would be me and Steve Barclay who would be sitting down and meeting them, he told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme.Let\u0027s hope those conversations can take place.Mr Lidington said a key part of any discussion would be to understand exactly where the Labour frontbench is coming from.He said: I would be saying to Labour, \u0027What is it that you don\u0027t like about what is in the Political Declaration at the moment?\u0027, because what we have there is an idea of a customs arrangement with the European Union that still allows us to have an independent trade policy on top of that, but while getting access - tariff-free and quota-free - for our goods and agriculture to the European market.I would be asking what on earth they mean when they say they want to be in a customs union with the EU but also for Britain to have a say in EU trade policy with other countries. That\u0027s not something that\u0027s allowed under the European treaties.This seems to be wishful thinking.Welcome to The Independent\u0027s politics liveblog, where we will be bringing you all the latest updates throughout\u0026nbspthe day.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Despite the challenges, the two leaders agreed that their teams should hold talks as to whether a way through can be found that would gain the broadest possible support in the UK Parliament and respect the guidelines agreed by the European Council. The Prime Minister and the President will meet again before the end of February to take stock of these discussions.”Ms May\u0027s meeting Mr Tusk comes a day after he caused a row by\u0026nbspwarning that there was a “special place in hell” for those who promoted Brexit without even a basic plan for how to actually enact it.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

absolute – poverty.“Relative poverty – the invisible poverty that often bypasses social safety nets – is still a potent issue,” he said.“It cannot be right that – in the fifth or sixth richest nation in the world – food banks have become essential in the lives of so many people.“And poverty amid plenty – is corrosive.\u0026nbsp It alienates and breeds resentment.\u0026nbsp The human spirit can endure great hardship but inequality gives it a bitter edge.”The speech comes after Sir John became the first Conservative to call effectively for Brexit to be scrapped, saying the government should “revoke Article 50 with immediate effect”.Corbyn facing backlash from pro-EU MPs over Brexit letterBrexit already hitting UK household finances due to higher pricesEU ‘place in hell’ warning puts

was urged to recognise that MPs had “killed” her deal and that attempts to revive it with minor “tinkering” – while sticking to her strict ‘red lines’ - were doomed to failure.Sir John also highlighted how the government’s own forecasts suggested the North East’s economy would crash by 16 per cent under a no-deal Brexit.“In recent decades – through no fault of its own – the North East has lost shipyards, coal mines and glass manufacturing,” he said.“No government could – or would – stand by and watch that happen – but even the fear of it suggests that measures to protect the North East must be put in place – and quickly.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news

The country’s future is at stake, and it’s about time the national interest took priority.”But the political logjam over Brexit appears to be putting the government’s legislation on hold in the aftermath of Theresa May’s deal being crushed by a historic margin.And given the lack of an agreed deal at Westminster – or knowledge of what the deal will eventually entail – it is difficult for the prime minister to make progress with five Brexit-related laws, including the fisheries bill, the agricultural bill, and the financial services bill.\u0027Special place in hell\u0027 for pro-Brexit campaigners, Tusk saysThis is why in recent weeks cabinet ministers such as the foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt and the Commons leader, Andrea Leadsom, have suggested the government may need to delay Brexit by a few weeks in order to pass critical legislation – if Ms May eventually cobbles together a majority for an exit deal.Asked about the adjournment of the Commons at 3.27pm, the prime minister’s official spokesman said: The business of the House is set out in advance, there have been days recently where they have been working beyond midnight dealing with statements and with debates on Brexit.I think this week they have been dealing with some important domestic statutory instruments and other significant issues which are going to be debated in the coming days.Created with Sketch.Brexit and travel: all you need to know Show all 14Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.British passports that expire after 29 March 2019 will continue to be valid as UK travel documents, but will lose the power that comes with being a European Union passport – notably the right of free movement within the EU27.You will still be able to travel to the EU with your pet after Brexit, but it could well get more complicated depending on the status that the European Union decide to apply.

The first that person will know about it is when someone bangs on their door in the early hours of the morning to bundle them into an immigration enforcement van and take them to a detention centre.“Those we get to hear about are probably only the tip of the iceberg, but we do know that £21m was paid out by the Home Office in just five years to compensate for wrongful detention, and terrible mistakes are certainly what happened in the Windrush cases.”The committee said it had looked at the Home Office files of Windrush citizens who had been unable to prove their UK residence, and that there was “masses” of evidence, including records of national insurance contributions going back decades.Algerian man dies in London immigration detention centreGovernment plans risk ‘riding roughshod’ over rights of immigrantsSuicides in immigration removal centres kept ‘state secret’, MPs told“If there had been any independence in the decision making, these people would never have been detained, yet they were detained not once but twice. The papers in their files were ignored, and the pleas of their families were swept aside,” Ms Harman added.“After the right to life, the right not to be unlawfully detained is one of the most important human rights. It should not be the case that a person has fewer protections from wrongful detention as an immigrant than they would if they had actually committed a crime.”The MPs also said detainees should have better and more consistent access to legal aid to challenge their detention, and that a reinstatement of legal aid for immigration cases should be considered.Sam Grant, policy and campaigns manager for Liberty, supported the calls, describing indefinite detention as an “ineffective and inefficient waste of money and human life”.\u0026nbspBella Sankey, director of Detention Action, also backed the calls, saying\u0026nbspa 28-day time limit was “urgently” needed along with early judicial oversight and safeguards against “cat and mouse” re-detentions.“The JCHR has expertly laid bare the injustice and abuse inherent in our current system. Parliament will have the opportunity to take this historic step when it considers the immigration bill and we urge MPs of all parties to take it,” she added.UN backs calls for time limit on UK immigration detentionLeila Zadeh, executive director of UK Lesbian \u0026amp Gay Immigration Group, welcomed the report but called for the government to bring an end to the detention of LGBT+ people, saying it was “wholly inappropriate”“They run a significant risk of being locked up among other people who may display the same discriminatory attitudes and hostility from which they have fled. They also frequently struggle to be granted refugee status if they have to make their asylum applications from inside a detention centre,” she added.A Home Office spokesperson said:\u0026nbsp “Immigration detention is an important part of the wider immigration system, but we are committed to usingdetention sparingly and only when necessary. Ninety-five per cent of people liable for removal at any one time are managed in the community.“Any decision to detain someone is reviewed by a Detention Gatekeeper who acts independently from referring and case working teams to ensure an inidual’s suitability for detention has been fully assessed, and any vulnerabilities have been considered.“An inidual is only detained when there is realistic prospect of removal within a reasonable timescale. We do not detain people indefinitely, and the law does not allow it.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereAsylum and ImmigrationOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

However it notably drops Labour’s previous demand to secure the\u0026nbsp”exact same benefits” of the single market.There are also calls for “unambiguous agreements on the detail of future security arrangements, including access to the European Arrest Warrant and vital shared databases”.Additional reporting from agencies\u0026nbspThe Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Im still your buckaroo, and to this day your hugs are still the very best in the whole wide world, the star wrote on Instagram in  - sharing a throwback snap of her with her father when she was a baby.Thanks for my work ethic, my love of Busby Berkeley films  club sandwiches, for teaching me the importance of handwritten thank you notes, and for giving me that signature Markle nose.

Here, leading Conservative Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg offers his view:THE EU has taken an almost religious approach to Britain’s latest move towards securing a Brexit deal.The compromise put forward by my fellow MP Kit Malthouse has been immediately dismissed and any prospect of further negotiation turned away. The mighty EU has spoken and will not be gainsaid.In negotiating the compromise, both Leavers and Remainers made concessions. This has led to criticism from their supporters, as I found in my weekly radio show on LBC.Callers felt that I had become a “snowflake” in my willingness to see £billion of taxpayers’ money spent without giving us any advantage in future negotiations.The legal basis for the EU demanding money is weak. A House of Lords report came to the conclusion that while there could be a moral obligation, under UK, EU and international law there was no valid or forceful claim.The only motive for paying is to secure a good future deal, rather than to pay a ransom for our freedom.Yet I have come to the conclusion that leaving on March  is at risk and exiting the EU is a prize worth paying for and on which thewill be great.Unfortunately, in spite of the Referendum result, the majority of MPs are reluctant to see the UK part from the EU and at the least want terms that mirror our membership.This may well not be the view of most voters, who seem to welcome the clean break and are not fearful of the scare stories.It is, therefore, crucial to ensure the fears of those who are far from enthusiastic Brexiteers are assuaged. This is where the Malthouse Compromise comes in.By offering money and making the prospect of a No Deal Brexit unlikely, possible moderate former Remainers are willing to avoid Parliamentary tactics that would frustrate our departure.They can accept the replacement of the backstop, which could keep us tied in to the EU’s rules and courts forever, with a routine trade agreement based on existing processes commonly used around the world.This would not hamper the development of a future relationship which would be discussed once we have left. Although in these discussions we would lose the leverage of cash, we would not be squeezed by the backstop.The second stage of the compromise is that the implementation period could be extended by one year. Currently the withdrawal agreement proposes a maximum of two years.In this time we would remain subject to EU laws and what follows, but it makes the prospect of not finalising a future relationship less likely, which gives comfort to those who are determined to avoid No Deal.In my view, an extra  months of vassalage after  years is an unwelcome but not unaffordable price to pay. Critics may ask why Brexiteers want to lessen the chance of a No Deal departure — and the reason is simple.Regardless of the folly of Project Fear, which becomes more preposterous by the day, the Parliamentary arithmetic means we must either lessen the prospect by compromise or it will be done by sharp practice in the House of Commons.This could lead to delay or even no Brexit at all. This would destroy any remaining trust of politicians in our constitutional settlement, it would show reckless contempt for voters, yet the Brexit-denying amendment put forward by Yvette Cooper last week was only defeated by  votes.As with all compromises, Malthouse is not perfect but is enough for each side of the argument in the UK to accept.The question remains, will the EU response be positive  So far, it has not.This has always been at the heart of the debate, and in a way a compelling reason for going. Is the EU a Mafia-style organisation that has to punish countries that do not subscribe to its religion Their response to the Malthouse Compromise and the PM’s request to re-open the text will answer this question. It must be clear to the EU that the current withdrawal agreement will not do.Defeated in the Commons by the largest margin ever achieved in the lower house on Government business, it is simply too one-sided and allows too great a triumph to the EU.If the EU were to insist on its inalterability requiring the punishment of a recalcitrant, freedom-loving nation then it will reveal its true and barbarous colours. It would be evident on its own that we are right to leave.How much better it would bethis were wrong and that in fact the EU is the civilised organisation it claims to be — respecting democracy, the nation state and constitutional procedures.

Her squabbling party has called a temporary truce. And nobody, including the EU, wants Jeremy Corbyn to take control.Even Labour MPs are rallying behind her — at a price. And working-class voters have given the Tories a healthy seven-point lead. They might even win a snap election.Played skilfully, this could win a deal that satisfies both Remainers and Leavers.Yet there are fears Mrs May will use it to revive her wretched Chequers plan, which sparked the resignations of Boris Johnson and David Davis, or the botched deal thrown out last month by a -vote margin.She has made a worrying start by apparently binning the No Deal card — the only one that truly scares the EU. Mrs May has no intention of playing this ace — and never had.There are other worrying signs.This showdown with EU hardliners requires fresh thinking and shrewd advice from seasoned players. Crawford Falconer, an ex-World Trade Organisation ambassador, was recruited by the Brexit department for precisely these skills.Indeed, he is the ONLY person in the Government machine who has ever negotiated a trade deal.Yet bafflingly, Mrs May is keeping this star player on the sidelines.Instead, she will fly to Brussels with Whitehall mandarin Olly Robbins, the pro-EU fanatic who plunged Britain into the backstop trap she is now under pressure to escape from.Robbins hates Brexit and has privately warned the PM this is Mission Impossible.Mrs May — herself a Remainer who has never grasped the case for Brexit — will be joined by trusted “deputy PM” David Lidington, a dyed-in-the-wool Brussels worshipper.In such company, even the inclusion in her team of a thundering Brexiteer Attorney-General Geoffrey Cox is only mildly reassuring.Mrs May is notoriously stubborn. She can also be devious.After nearly three years, even her closest political colleagues — who can be counted on one hand with a couple of missing digits — have no idea what her Brexit might look like.Voters are increasingly irritated by this foot-dragging.Why should we remain part of an organisation that wants to punish us by stealing Gibraltar, Northern Ireland and our car industry Nobody who watched the brutal humiliation of poor little Greece will be surprised. This tragic and insolvent nation should never have been admitted to the EU, still less the Eurozone.Only with the assistance of US banking giant Goldman Sachs — “The Vampire Squid” — got them in under the wire. Once inside, they launched a borrowing and spending binge which ended in tears in the  crash.Greece might have flourished as a cheap but lovely tourist economy. Instead, it is now being cruelly tormented by Brussels and lumbered with multi-billion euros debts it can never repay.Greece symbolises all that is wrong with arrogant Brussels — the catastrophic Euro, inflexible economic policies and mass unemployment for under-s.Above all, there is the sneering contempt of unsackable Eurocrats for the million people they rule from subsidised ivory towers.Theresa May is a poor negotiator who never truly believed No Deal is better than a bad deal.Without this implicit threat, Brussels will give little and demand much in . It would be a pleasure to eat my words and watch Mrs May play a blinder.She can use her good luck to land a historic victory. Or she can blink and condemn Britain to colony status, paying billions more into EU coffers while being led by the nose on trade deal promises that never materialise.In which case, forget about that snap election fantasy.The Conservative Party would never be forgiven by the .million voters who voted Brexit — or those who wish they had.SECURITY CHIEFS are dusting off Cold War plans anticipating a Soviet nuclear strike to whisk the Queen to safety in the event of . . .  er . . . a No Deal Brexit.Presumably The Mall will be cleared of traffic and used as a landing strip to fly Her Maj out before revolutionary Remainers string her up for supporting Brexit.The only question is whether she will go quietly.The royals refused to leave London even after Buckingham Palace was bombed during the Second World War.This Project Fear nonsense is even more insane than the idea that thousands will die of fruit shortages.To quote Corporal Jones: “Don’t panic!!”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Do they not want Britain to succeed Do they not see that their bizarre, condescending attitude is EXACTLY why they lost in  THE rocketing suicide rate amongst teenagers is nothing short of a national crisis.And the solution MUST involve the social media firms who are profiting from youngsters’ suffering.They have been given quite enough warning that they are not doing enough to protect vulnerable kids.They have said for years that they just need a bit more time, and that they’d fix the problem themselves.Well, they’ve failed.Government has no choice but to step in – and it needs a concerted effort from the Education, Health and Culture Departments.One more tragic death is one too many.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I love you. I have one father. Please stop victimising me through the media so we can repair our relationship.’“He writes her a really long letter in , and he closes it by requesting a photo op with her.“She feels like, ‘That’s the opposite of what I’m saying. I’m telling you I don’t want to communicate through the media, and you’re asking me to communicate through the media. Did you hear anything I said ’“It’s almost like they’re ships passing.“He knows how to get in touch with her.“It’s super-painful because Meg was always so dutul.“I think she will always feel genuinely devastated by what he’s done. At the same time, because she’s a daughter, she has a lot of sympathy for him.”The close friends spoke anonymously to US magazine People after Thomas made a string of public outbursts about his royal daughter and Meghan’s half-sister Samantha cashed in on their “non-existent” relationship.The Sun understands the pals spoke to People with Meghan’s approval, and that her press team at Kensington Palace were kept in the dark.One friend said: “Meg has sat silently back and endured the lies and untruths.“We want to stand up against the global bullying we are seeing and speak the truth about who our friend, a  mother-to-be, really is.“We worry about what this is doing to her and the baby. It’s wrong to put anyone under this level of emotional trauma, let alone when they’re pregnant.”The pals vehemently defend the Duchess and reveal she was devastated by her father’s response to her letter and did not talk to him after that.They also claim that:They said Thomas’s older children, Thomas Markle Junior and Samantha Grant, “were in their mid-to-late teens when  Meghan was born” and “were not a part of her le”.The friend added: “They’ve been made to appear as siblings who were very close and then they had this falling out, and that’s not the truth at all.“Fast-forward to Meghan dating Harry and now Samantha isname Markle. And then she began this career capitalising on Meg.“Everyone who knows Meg knows the two of them have no relationship.”The same friend also gave Meghan’s side of the story, after her dad Thomas pulled out of walking her down the aisle at the royal wedding due to a heart attack.They told the magazine Meghan had looked after her father financially, despite what  Samantha had claimed.They said: “Meghan’s been a rock for everyone in her family.“It’s a shame that it’s being painted in this other light that is just absolutely .“She took care of her father with such incredible generosity.“The fact that this could be flipped around, that she was acting out or not caring for him, is preposterous.“The Saturday before the wedding, she and Harry were told that a story was going to come out the next day saying that Tom was staging pictures with the paparazzi.“Their team told them thatthe story was fake, they could file a complaint.“So Meg calls Tom and asks him, and he’s swearing up and down that it’s not true. The next day the pictures come out.“Even with all that, Meg and Harry were still so focused on getting him to London.“At no point was there talk of, ‘Now that we know he lied, he’s in trouble’.“Tom wouldn’t take her calls, wouldn’t take Harry’s calls. The next morning when the car got there , he wouldn’t get in.“ Meg heard he’d had a heart attack and she’s calling him and texting him, even up to the night before the wedding.“It was like, ‘Please pick up. I love you, and I’m scared.’ It was endless.”Another friend revealed how spiritual Meghan was, saying she meditates and “really lives in the current moment”.They also reveal that the Duchess does all her own make-up, dresses and styles herself and writes her own speeches for herself and Harry.Former actress Meghan has been accused of intimidating staff with am emails and a “demanding manner”.But one of her former colleagues on US TV drama Suits said: “The email thing is such a weird slant on someone who is actually an incredibly organized, diligent, focused, hard-working person.“She was always that way.“She showed up on set more prepared than anyone .”Meghan was also praised for providing hand-warmers for Palace guards standing in the cold weather and for laying on an ice-cream and sorbet stand for her staff.Kensington Palace refused to comment.NOVEMBER , : Meghan and Harry announce  engagement but he admits he hasn’t met her dad Thomas.DECEMBER :   Thomas  tells reporters he’d “love to” walk his daughter down the aisle.MAY , :  Kensington Palace  says Thomas will be giving his daughter away.MAY : It’s revealed he took cash, allegedly £,,  for staged paparazzi pictures.MAY : He pulls out of the wedding for health reasons.MAY : The royal wedding.JUNE :   Thomas appears on Good Morning Britain to say the photos were a “mistake”.JULY : He gives a newspaper interview claiming his daughter would be “nothing without me”.AUGUST :   He reveals he once slammed the phone down on  Harry during a heated call over the snaps.OCTOBER :  The royal couple announce they’re expecting baby in  the spring.OCTOBER :    Thomas says he heard about his grandchild on the car radio.NOVEMBER  DECEMBER:   He gives more damaging   interviews, saying things like he hopes to meet the baby one day despite Meghan “ghosting” him since her wedding.JANUARY , :  He  tells The Sun  he is writing a tell-all book about his daughter.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Ever.You cannot ever even call in sick as that is not allowed.We are British, but generally cannot ever manage to hire British due to poor work ethics.Following the row, Jullian has stood by his views, claiming that the work ethic of Brits are inferior to those from Eastern Europe.Jullian said: Our experience of running a small, private, family-run coffee shop in Hove is that the very poorest type of employee is a British one. Full stop.The last candidate you want to take on - and we try ardently to hire everyone - is British.He added that Brits take advantage of the fact they have a benefit system and theyre not motivated to earn money.Jullian said his business has been hit with floods of bad reviews online from angry Brits after Victoria posted screenshots of their conversation on Facebook.A TUC spokesperson said: “If he’s looking for the title of Britain’s Worst Boss, it sounds like he’s going about it the right way.“It’s illegal to discriminate against job applicants based on their ethnicity. And profiteering from staff illness by docking their wages is very likely illegal too.“Britain’s workers have a very strong work ethic.

It is uniquely rooted in ties of family, history and geography.The recent past has been a moment of reflection in the UK and Ireland as we have commemorated the centenary of a series of key events in our shared history.Today those ties of family and friendship between our countries are more important than they have ever been.And I believe there is a yearning in the hearts of all the peoples of these islands for a close and trusting relationship between all of us, and an absolute horror that we should take even a single step backwards in the progress we have collectively achieved.She proposed annual meetings between the British and Irish governments after Brexit to ensure the two countries work closely together.She promised to lobby Mrs May on the issue when they hold talks in Belfast tomorrow.She said: We will be reiterating our opposition to the current backstop. And the fact that Parliament has now backed that position means that she has a clear mandate to go back to Brussels.The current backstop is toxic to those of us living in Northern Ireland, and indeed for unionists right across the United Kingdom, because it would cause the break-up of the United Kingdom into the medium and longer term.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Like Mr Benn on crack, it was.Armour, codpieces, nappies, tights, doublet and hose, and a gigantic white smock, bleached with human urine, which had one grovelling “courtier” wondering: “Has all the p*** been washed out, my Lord King ”A good question.We didn’t actually get the answer, though, until part two, on Wednesday, when, after a brief detour round his ancestors, Louis IX of France, William the Conqueror and Henry II, viewers got to the nub of things, with Professor Chris Given-Wilson explaining the agonising death of Edward II: “By thrusting a hollow instrument, like the end of a trumpet, up his fundament.”“’Old on a minute,” said a rattled Danny. “He’s been stabbed  With a trumpet ”“Into his fundament.” Long pause.“Don’t tell me it’s up his a**e ”Right up it, Danny, with a red-hot poker. News which didn’t just do his “nut in”, it seemed to derail the entire documentary.They ran out of direct royal ancestors shortly afterwards as well, and the BBC adopted its stupid default setting in such circumstances. It turned Danny’s Right Royal Family into a dance and cookery show, complete with demonstrations of both, from medieval experts.It was about this time I also sussed out what was going on in the background, with all those winsome historians. An audition.The BBC was using it to find its new face of history, though why any of the blokes turned up is a mystery. Auntie’s already made it clear: “The days of white, middle-aged men explaining stuff are over.”Danny, on the other hand, can be tolerated, because he’s their new performing Cockney. A novelty act who can be dressed up and patronised so much he ended this one doing some weird medieval can-can, with his family, in front of his lost ancestral pile.A trumpet wasn’t quite shoved up his fundament as they danced, but the p*** had very much been washed out of him, my Lord King.GREAT TV lies and delusions of the month. “I think it’s going to be a really great show.” Cheryl Tweedy, The Greatest Dancer.“We do TV shows and we’re national treasures.” Jedward, Celebrity Coach Trip.“People will remember my name and I love that.” Some t**t off Ship- wrecked.IF you’re to take anything from the news experts have claimed Monday, January  was the most depressing day of the year, it’s probably the fact the experts clearly never sat through what happened eight days later, on Tuesday, January .Britain’s Top  Dogs Live: .

In a bombshell letter  days before Brexit, the Labour leader has shted his red lines and offered Theresa May a clear way to leave the EU -she backs a full customs union. It meansshe accepts his demands, Mrs May can get a House of Commons majority for Brexit. But firstly, thats a huge  that could split the Tories. Secondly, it throws a huge spanner in the works hours before the Prime Minister meets EU chiefs in Brussels today. And thirdly, its enraged some Labour MPs who want Jeremy Corbyn to stop helping the government push through Brexit - and back a second EU referendum instead. All that means its a long shot, and probably wont happen. But its still an important intervention in Brexit. So what is new today, how has Labour changed its position, and why are Remainer MPs angry  Heres our guide - and the letter in full.  Labours leader has written a letter to Theresa May, saying he WILL back her on a Brexit dealit meets five demands:A permanent, UK-wide customs union with the EU Close alignment with the EU single market Dynamic alignment on rights and protections, so UK standards keep pace with new ones in the EU Clear commitments on participation in EU agencies Unambiguous agreements on future securityMr Corbyn has already held talks with the Prime Minister and more are expected to follow. He promises to discuss his proposal with her in a constructive way to secure a sensible agreement. He says compromise is now needed to please both the EU and the House of Commons, which voted down the -page Brexit deal by a record majority last month. How has his position changed   Labour already backed a customs union. But this change in tactics is vital. Firstly, the letter means Labour has officially ditched its six tests a Brexit deal would have to meet before being backed. The tests were unveiled in March . They were based partly on Tory promises about Brexit, but included ambitions that were obviously impossible - such as securing the exact same benefits the UK currently has. They were derided as bollocks by Shadow Trade Secretary Barry Gardiner. Today the very same Mr Gardiner told the BBC: Its not about tests now. What we are doing is saying we believe that these are the options that are available that would actually secure a majority in the House of Commons. Secondly, it means Labour is putting calls for a second EU referendum firmly on the back burner - despite huge pressure within the party. Labour pledged to keep a second EU referendum as an option on the table thanks to a motion at the party conference last year. Remainers say Labour should campaigning for that public vote NOW, having failed to force a general election. But Jeremy Corbyn is against it. Thirdly, there is no mention in the letter of delaying Brexit. Labour has said extending the March  date may be inevitable. But this shows the party is still striving to help get a soft Brexit through as soon as it can. Why are some Labour MPs furious   Labour Remain-backers have voiced their fury at Jeremy Corbyn for - in their words - enabling Brexit. They want him to back a second EU referendum instead. And the words of Shadow Trade Secretary Barry Gardiner, who quoted Theresa May herself, wont help. He said: Jeremy is trying to set out what we believe is needed to make a success of Brexit. Labour MP Chuka Umunna blasted: This is not opposition, it is the facilitation of a deal which will make this country poorer. Labour MP Owen Smith said: “Backing Brexit - even on these terms - would still shrink our economy, cost jobs and lost investment, indulge nativist nostalgia and isolationism. Fellow Remainer MP Chris Leslie said: “Seriously  Offering to help Tory Govt enable Brexit  It’s not just Labour’s conference policy in the bin. When the jobs go  revenues for services dry up as a result, Labour’s leadership will have ZERO right to complain: they share responsibility.” Labour MP Tonia Antoniazzi wrote sarcastically: Nice to be briefed about this @UKLabour @WelshLabour. If at ANY point you would like to consult MPs and also take the Labour Party conference motion into consideration... Just let me know... Cheers...  For the first time, it means Theresa May doesnt need to change the backstop - or appease Tory Brexiteers - to get her deal through. The backstop is an insurance clause that would trap the UK under EU customs rules from , in exchange for keeping the Irish border open. The Prime Minister is meeting EU chiefs in Brussels today to try and tweak the clause. Shes done that because Tory Brexiteers said otherwise, theres no way they would pass the Brexit deal. Yet EU chiefs say they wont change the backstop, leaving talks deadlocked. Now Labour claims it has a way out by offering that permanent customs union - arranged, crucially, through the future framework and not the -page exit deal that contains the backstop. If she backs it, Labour claims, Theresa May wont need Tory Brexiteer help to get a Commons majority. Barry Gardiner said: What were saying is actually you can do this another way. What you can do is say lets look at the future political framework, andthe future political framework were agreed now between the EU and ourselves to be a customs union, then actually theres no problem at that point when you get to the end of the transition period, because youre already in a customs union and therefore you dont need the backstop.  Theresa May has made clear she wants to be able to strike trade deals around the world. If the UK is in a full customs union with the EU, she cant do that. And Labour proposed a customs union before - only to be defeated in the House of Commons. Evenshe did fold and accept a customs union, the row over it could split Theresa Mays party for good. Tory Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg once warned of a revolt the size of that over the Victorian-era Corn Laws. There is one important upshot though. If Theresa May refuses Jeremy Corbyns offer, he can reasonably pin the blame on herit leads to a No Deal Brexit.  A No spokeswoman said: The letter has been received and we will reply in due course. Many of our positions on many of the issues in the letter are well known. The PMs focus is on securing changes to the backstop. Thats what she is focused on today. But a No spokeswoman repeatedly declined to say Theresa May will put any specic proposals to EU leaders today to solve the deadlock. She said: She will be discussing the ongoing urgent work we have been undertaking since the vote to secure the changes that mean we can secure parliamentary support. She added: You know our position on the customs union and that has not changed. No new meetings with Corbyn were confirmed as of am but Mrs Mays door remains open.What happens next   Theresa May is meeting EU chiefs including Donald Tusk and Jean-Claude Juncker in Brussels today. Theyre likely to brush her off, a day after saying Tory Brexiteers who had no plan have a special place in hell. Then shes travelling to Dublin on Friday night for dinner with Irish premier Leo Varadkar. Hes likely to brush her off too. But in between and afterwards, theres a window for talks with Jeremy Corbyn and his top team about the offer. David Lidington, her de facto deputy, said there would be a channel open to Labour. Shes unlikely to have a new deal ready by next week, meaning MPs will get a vote directing the way forward on February . That could bind her hands, delay Brexit, or just leave us in more deadlock as time ticks down to March .  Dear Prime Minister, Thank you for taking the time to meet last week to discuss the Brexit negotiation and our alternative approaches to finding a deal that can command support in Parliament and be negotiated with the EU. There is, as was demonstrated last week, a clear majority in Parliament that no deal must now be taken off the table and that there can be noto a hard border in Northern Ireland in any circumstance. We recognise that your priority is now to seek legally binding changes to the backstop arrangements contained within the Withdrawal Agreement, as we discussed when we met. However, without changes to your negotiating red lines, we do not believe that simply seeking modications to the existing backstop terms is a credible or sufficient response either to the scale of your defeat last month in Parliament, or the need for a deal with the EU that can bring the country together and protect jobs. As you have said many times before, the EU has been clear that any withdrawal agreement would need to include a backstop to guarantee noto a hard border on the island of Ireland. Labour has long argued that the Government should change its negotiating red lines and seek signicant changes to the Political Declaration to provide clarity on our future relationship and deliver a closer economic relationship with the EU. That would also ensure that any backstop would be far less likely to be invoked. The changes we would need to see include: * A permanent and comprehensive UK-wide customs union. This would include alignment with the union customs code, a common external tarf and an agreement on commercial policy that includes a UK say on future EU trade deals. We believe that a customs union is necessary to deliver the frictionless trade that our businesses, workers and consumers need, and is the only viable way to ensure there is no hard border on the island of Ireland. As you are aware, a customs union is supported by most businesses and trade unions. * Close alignment with the Single Market. This should be underpinned by shared institutions and obligations, with clear arrangements for dispute resolution. * Dynamic alignment on rights and protections so that UK standards keep pace with evolving standards across Europe as a minimum, allowing the UK to lead the way. * Clear commitments on participation in EU agencies and funding programmes, including in areas such as the environment, education, and industrial regulation. * Unambiguous agreements on the detail of future security arrangements, including access to the European Arrest Warrant and vital shared databases. We believe these negotiating objectives need to be enshrined in law before the UK leaves the EU to provide certainty for businesses and a clear framework for our future relationship. We recognise that any negotiation with the EU will require flexibility and compromise. Our first priority must be a deal that is best for jobs, living standards, our communities, in the context of increased and more equitable investment across all regions and nations of the UK. That approach should guide how alignment with EU regulations is to be maintained in future, as well discussions on dispute resolution, the role of the ECJ, and competition and migration rules. EU leaders have been clear that such changes to the Political Declaration and a closer relationship are possiblesuch a request is made by the UK government andthe current red lines change. We believe that a close economic relationship along these lines would make it far less likely that any backstop arrangements would ever be needed. The Government’s failure to secure a deal that can command the support of Parliament means time has run out for the necessary preparation and for legislation to be finalised. Following last week’s rejection by the House of Commons of ‘no deal’, all necessary steps must be taken to avoid such an outcome. My colleagues and I look forward to discussing these proposals with you further, in the constructive manner in which they are intended, with the aim of securing a sensible agreement that can win the support of parliament and bring the country together. Yours sincerely, Jeremy Corbyn MP Leader of the Opposition "},{"url":null,"title":"no deal brexit mobile phone","story":"NewsNo Deal Brexit: Mobile phone roaming charges face immediate rise after March Tory ministers have been accused of \"sneaking out\" the end of free EU roaming laws in an obscure law just  days before BrexitShareCommentsByDan BloomOnline Political Editor:,  FEB Updated:,  FEB NewsGuaranteed EU free roaming launched in  - but you can kiss it goodbye in no deal\"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMobile roaming charges face an immediate hikethere is a No Deal Brexit, the government has confirmed. Tory ministers are revoking the EU law which guarantees UK citizens pay the same for using their phone on the Continent as they do at home. That will leave mobile phone firms free to hike costs whenever they like after the UK leaves. Guaranteed free roaming launched across the EU just  months ago - and meant big savings. But that guarantee will be scrappedthere is no deal, thanks to an obscure law laid before Parliament this week.   The current system caps the costs charged between EU and UK phone operators, letting them pass on the savings to customers. But the Mobile RoamingRegulations admit these caps will have no legal forcethere is no Brexit deal. That means phone giants could see their wholesale costs spiral, making roaming packages unaffordable and forcing them to push up costs, the government warns. Under the new rules, customers will still be prompted once theyve spent pound to prevent massive accidental bills. Travellers will also be prompted when theyve hit % and % of their data allowance. But it will spell the end of guaranteed free roaming across the EU, notes on the new law admit.  Alex Neill of consumer group Which  told HuffPost UK: “Anyto sky-high charges for using mobile phones abroad would be a bitter blow for millions of consumers. “The government should seek to avoid these charges by securing a deal with the EU. Butthat is not the outcome, companies must be absolutely clear about any extra charges their customers could be facing. Back when warnings first emerged about an end to roaming, the government insisted firms would not hike charges because of market competition. But MoneySavingExpert revealed last week that just two out of  major UK phone firms have guaranteed to keep free roaming in a No Deal Brexit . Most said they had no plans to raise charges - but stopped short of giving a cast-iron guarantee.  Consumer groups lobbied the government to keep roaming free by law. But after careful consideration the government did not agree, because it would pass all the costs on to phone firms. That, in turn, could have pushed up the cost of mobile phone tarfs overall to compensate, an explanatory note to the new law says. Shadow Brexit minister Jenny Chapman said: “These proposals prove that it will be holidaymakers and businesses that are forced to pay the price for this government’s incompetence. “It’s unacceptable that these plans have been snuck out. Ministers need to start being straight with the British public about the consequences of no deal and take it off the table once and for all.  The anti-Brexit group Best For Britain branded the fiasco the Last Days of Roam and claimed business travellers could be forced to pay pound more per month. Lib Dem MP Layla Moran said: The cost of a hard Brexit on British travellers is becoming abundantly clear. Millions of people are facing higher costs to make calls and texts abroad because of the Prime Ministers botched Brexit plans. A Department for Culture, Media and Sport spokesperson said: “The Statutory Instrument removes references to the EU mobile roaming framework from UK law to ensure our laws are effective andin the event we leave the EU without a deal. “It gives mobile operators legal clarity as to which laws they are subject to following EU withdrawal.” "},{"url":null,"title":"alfie lambs mum sent text","story":"NewsAlfie Lambs mum sent text saying they know were lying after car seat deathThe Old Bailey heard a message sent by Adrian Hoare to her boyfriend Stephen Waterson, from Croydon, said: \"They know that we are lying\"ShareByLuke OReillyEmily Pennink:,  FEB NewsAlfie Lamb was crushed to death in the footwell of a car, the Old Bailey was told \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA mum whose little boy was allegedly crushed by a car seat messaged her boyfriend saying police know were lying, in the aftermath, jurors were told. Adrian Hoare, , is accused of doing nothing when -year-old Stephen Waterson allegedly squashed three-year-old Alfie Lamb during a trip in his Audi convertible last February. Testying at the Old Bailey, she said she was scared of Waterson - and felt little when he bragged about his important family. Waterson was previously accused in court of using the fact his father is ex-Tory minister Nigel Waterson to make himself untouchable. She said she called her son my little noodle and fatpants. Hoare said: Hewas good with him. They had a bond as well. She said that Waterson also had a nickname for Alfie, calling him Tarzan. Asked about another name used for Alfie and she replied: Little s***.  Katy Thorne, QC, defending Hoare, asked: What about the name little s***  She replied: It was just another name it was not to be nasty or horrible it was just another name. Hoare told the court that both her and Waterson had hit Alfie in the past but only little taps. Waterson told the Old Bailey he lied to police after the incident because he was worried that he would get in trouble because the driver of the car, Marcus Lamb, had been disqualied. He told emergency operators he had been driving by and stopped to help try and revive Alfie.  The couple then claimed Alfie had been injured in a taxi which had driven off. A message sent from Hoare to Waterson just hours after the incident at .pm on February  of last year was read to the jury. It said: They know that we are lying. Duncan Atkinson, prosecuting,said: Even before you had reached the hospital you did not know what lies she had told the police, you were trying to get her alone and away from the police. Waterson answered: No-one was allowed in the room with Alfie, Alfie was with doctors. I did not know what lies she had told the police.  Mr Atkinson said: You were trying to get her alone. Waterson asked him: Is it a crime to be alone with your partner  He added: I have already admitted lying in the beginning, I have pleaded guilty to it, lies were told, I did not want to get anyone in trouble. Waterson is accused of deliberately moving his seat back because he was annoyed at Alfies crying. Giving evidence at the Old Bailey, Hoare said she felt scared when her partner was annoyed or angry, adding: You never knew how he was going to react to things. The hairdresser told jurors how police had been called after an incident in Gravesend, Kent, the year before Alfie died. She said she had been at a friends house when she heard Waterson had been seeing another woman. I asked him over the phone what was going on and we started arguing. He had come down to Gravesend in the car and asked me to go and speak to him. I had gone to speak to him and he had said that to me to get in the car. He started driving stupidly and he was shouting at mehe did not carehe killed us in the car. He was driving at speed and he did not carethere was other cars coming towards him or anything, she said.  Katy Thorne QC, defending, asked: When he said he did not carehe killed us, who was us  Hoare replied: I had just found out I was pregnant at the time. He was saying himself, me and the baby. She went on: I was scared and I eventually got him to stop the car. He then took me back down to near where my friends car was and went back to her house to speak to the police. My friends had been ringing Stephens phone trying to get him to take me back to the house and saying they would ring the policehe didnt.  Ms Thorne asked Hoareshe knew Watersons family had some important jobs. Hoare replied: He used to put it in conversation, yeah. Asked how it made her feel, she said: Little compared to him but I didnt really have anything. Hoare described Alfie as like any normal three-and-a-half-year-old boy. The defendant, who had a troubled upbringing in Gravesend, said: He could be naughty. He would try to climb about. He had a good imagination. Hoare said she used to call Alfie her little noodle and fat pants, while Waterson used the nickname Tarzan.  On February  last year, Alfie was captured on CCTV running around and holding his mothers hand. Hoare said Alfie had been happy on the shopping trip but began getting tired and stroppy. On Watersons relationship with her son, Hoare said: There had been times that Stephen had told him not to do something or he would tell him to be quiet and Alfie would not listen so he had got annoyed with him sometimes. Hoare denied she had hit her son, but said both she and Waterson would tap his hand. She told how she met Waterson in  after she moved to Blackpool for a fresh start. Her previous boyfriend was jailed for setting fire to her house in Gravesend, jurors were told.  Waterson had a big personality and was nice but did not like her speaking to other people, she said. Hoare suspected he had been unfaithful with ious women during their relationship. But she said: When I confronted him with it, he said I was being silly, I was being paranoid. Hoare and Waterson, of Croydon, south London, have denied manslaughter and the trial continues.

Adam Lamb said the teen smiled at him and was chewing her sleeve as she walked past him in the street in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, on May , . He had closed a car door to make it easier for her to pass, reports Nottinghamshire Live. She smiled asto say thanks. She was chewing her sleeve and walked along Westfield Lane, he told the inquest. She was looking into the bushes asshe was going inside them and then she was gone. After a TV appeal, Mr Lamb dialled  the next night and passed on details, saying he believed she was aged between nine or .  Chief superintendent Rob Grfin, for Nottinghamshire Police, who is responsible for missing person teams, said police officers spoke to Mr Lamb, but he was among many callers who reported sightings although they did not know her. Unfortunately the officers didnt ask Mr Lamb to take them to the scene and conduct a more thorough search, he said. Mr Lamb was like many others who describes a person who generally fits the bill for Amber rather than I know Amber. The bushes were dense and Mr Grfin said officers would have been forgiventhey had not found her hanged. A pathologist said there was no evidence others were involved in her death.  The inquest was told Ambers mother suspected her of attention seeking on the night she left home. PC Nicola Roe filled in a missing person form while speaking to mother Kelly Peat. She was told Amber had been asked to empty a cool box, was not happy about it and left. Assistant Coroner Laurinda Bower, who is conducting the hearing at the Council House in the city, asked about her observations of Mrs Peat. She seemed matter of fact when she was describing the situation, the officer said. The coroner asked: Did that surprise you  The officer said: Not really, to be honest. She seemed not particularly emotional or upset, maybe frustrated.  She described her background, referred to Amber throwing temper tantrums, what she called attention seeking. Mrs Peat said Amber had gone missing before and ed home safely.The mother seemed well rehearsed in giving information the officer said. PC Roe told the coroner: They expected her back the next morning. The coroner askedshe knew the family went to Tesco and had their tea before alerting the police that Amber was missing. PC Roe answered: I dont remember being told that or discussing specics with them. The inquest heard Ambers case was initially classed as medium risk by Nottinghamshire Police. When she had disappeared before while living in Derbyshire, that force graded them as high given her personal circumstances the coroner said. The inquest continues.

At the inquest, coroner Professor Paul Marks said the evidence showed Ms Majors death was an accident.   Ms Majors father, Mark David Major, said she had been looking forward to spending time on two booked holidays. He said: I think it was just an accident. She was just wanting to get her high. Ellie did not mean to take her own le and under estimated the strength of her tablets.The mum-of-one had been diagnosed with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, a type of arthritis effecting her joints, when she was aged  and was prescribed painkillers to deal with the pain.An inquest into her death atHull Coroners Courtheard Ms Major had attempted to end her own le by overdosing on drugs in March , which resulted in her losing custody over her son. But it had taken six months for her to be assessed by mental health experts because she was not a high risk - a decision which her family said had contributed to her poor mental health.   Ms Majors social worker told the hearing that the young mum had been “at the bottom of her list” because she was at a low medium risk. She told the hearing through tears: When I found out about Ellie’s death I was following up an appointment with her. I never accepted it, and that is what has thrown me so much. When I spoke with Ellie, she reassured me that her previous attempt to take her own le was impulsive and she was very remourseful. But Ms Majors heartbroken mother Marie Mitchell, , said it was beyond her she had been deemed a low risk. She said: How they can say there is not an urgent risk for a mum who tried to take her own le is beyond me - and her first assessment only happened six months later. Service manager at the Humber NHS Trust Jo Kent had put together a report and said no lessons had been learnt since Ellie’s tragic death.  Workers at the mental health teams said that Ellie had not attended planned meetings. The family also demanded answers over why Ellie was still being given eight dferent types of medication, despite her using the drugs to take her own le previously. Mr Major said he grew concerned about his daughter when he did not receive a WhatsApp message from her. She was found dead in her home in Hessle on August , . Police Officer John Norcross found “boxes and bags of prescription drugs” across the property. PC Norcross told the hearing: There was no evidence of third party involvement or anything suspicious.  Dr Ian Richmond, consultant histopathologist, said that the medical cause of death was multiple drug toxicity. Concluding the inquest as an open conclusion, coroner Professor Paul Marks said the evidence showed Ms Majors death was an accident. He said: The evidence heard today could make me believe up to the civil standard of proof, that I am persuaded by her fathers communication, this is probably an accident. The family said they would be looking to lodge a complaint with the NHS and take things further. Her heartbroken mother Marie said: It is better than what we were expecting, but we still have a lot of unanswered questions which we couldnt ask because the GP didnt have Ellies notes in front of him.

Sun lovers Laurel Cormack and David Crook say the luxury five-star resort in Corfu looked like a swamp. They had been looking forward to spending two weeks at TUIs Mayor Verde Grand Resort in Agios Gordios, which has a well-publicised private beach. However when the couple got there they found the usually golden sands littered with towering ft-wide smelly seaweed mounds buzzing with flies. David claims they were only able to spend half a day on the hotel beach and had to abandon their sunbeds due to the seaweed-choked waters and head to the crowded hotel pool.   The recruitment consultant blasted TUIs cavalier attitude to their complaints and for failing to inform guests of the natural phenomenon in advance so they could make alternative plans. TUI said they were sorry to hear of their disappointment and would be in contact with them again. David, from Southend-on-Sea, Essex, said: Were very much beach people and always book hotels with their own piece of beach with them. If were relaxing we prefer to sit on the beach rather than by the pool as it always gets crowded. The black seaweed was in very long strips andyou put your foot in it it would stick to your legs. In the water it was ft deep.   The seaweed was smelly and had a lot of flies around it, the water wasnt clear either. The holiday wasnt as good as it could have been as the one facility we paid for [the beach], the whole reason we picked that hotel, we werent able to take advantage of. When we booked the holiday online I was expecting the golden sands I saw in the brochure, not mounds of stinking seaweed. The -year-old said both he and his customer service assistant we Laurel, , were taunted by glossy promotional videos displayed in the hotel showcasing the resorts unspoiled beaches.  David said: The really irritating thing was in the main reception they had a big -inch TV with a continuous looped video. It kept showing all the bits of the hotel that wed booked the holiday for and werent able to use because they were seaweeded out. They were even playing in the lts and showing the same thing - we couldnt get away from them. Grandad-of-one David said that diggers were out at am scooping up the seaweed from the sand and dumping it in mounds on the hotel area of the beach instead of taking it away. David said: When we complained about it the TUI rep shrugged her shoulders and said theres nothing we can do, the hotel and local authority is doing all they can.  The diggers were there a couple of hours from am on a few mornings trying to clear the beach but as fast as they moved it the seaweed ed. They werent removing it though just piling it up, it was an eyesore. Apparently a couple of weeks before we were there there was a dredger that took away about  tonnes of seaweed. We werent there for that but you dont order a dredger and get diggers on the beachits not a problem. We could have used the less affected public beach further along but that would have entailed paying for sunbeds, parasols and snacks which defeats the object of going all inclusive. Our argument has always been never about assigning blame or responsibility for the seaweed. Its a natural phenomena, its not the hotel or TUIs fault and I never said it was.  What I was really incensed about was the fact that all theyre doing is hiding behind it being a natural phenomena. It first started at the end of March and we went in June - theyd known about this for three months. Do they not monitor their resorts for this type of event  Do they not noty customers  If wed had an informed choice we wouldnt have cancelled our holiday, but we would have just gone to a dferent resort not affected by it. I dont want a load of money back, I just want them to hold their hands up and admit its something they should have made people aware of.  I wouldnt want other people to go through the experience, its just wrong. David complained to TUI in writing and said he was disappointed with their response - even receiving a missive thoughtlessly sent out. David said: I had an email from one TUI rep again explaining it was a natural phenomenon and that she was sorry about the incontinence this has caused. My first thought was that the email hadnt been put through spell check or checked for any autocorrects it was just speedily bashed out with little or no thought. Ive also tried speaking to them on the phone and on one glorious occasion was on hold for  minutes listening to a continuous loop of the same song - by the end of it I was losing the will to live. Dad-of-two David said the experience had put him off booking a TUI holiday in the future. David said: The cavalier attitude TUI took has meant that we will never use them again and nor would we recommend them. The amount we paid might not be a lot of money to a lot of people, but its a big chunk of money for us. Were not wealthy people were just normal working people - its our two weeks of rest and relaxation. TUIs whole attitude really disappointed me, its just left a really bad taste in the mouth. I never said it was their fault, all I was saying was do you not monitor your resorts for this kind of occurrences to let people know so they can make an informed choice about whether they want to proceed with it or not  A TUI spokesman said: Were sorry to hear of the Cormack partys disappointment and we will be in contact the customers directly once again to discuss in further detail.

The mum-of-three wore a dress by Eponine - a small, independent brand she has worn on a number of occasions and has been credited with putting on the map. She teamed the pound, green dress with black tights and trendy black boots. But fashion lovers quickly spotted something a little strange about the bright look - and theyre not impressed.   Fans noticed the pockets of the dress resemble an angry face, and one fan even dubbed it the worlds angriest dress. Some even compared it to a monster, the childrens character Evil Pea and Kermit the Frog. But others loved the look regardless of the positioning of the pockets.  Kate was asked to bring an item that made her happy along to one of the schools, and what she picked was adoarble.She took a photo of her family - including Princes George and Louis and Princess Charlotte - which she took out of her purse and proudly showed it off the the pupils.The printed picture is the adorable snap the Cambridge family used for their Christmas cards this year, and shows them sitting on a log in the grounds of their county home, Anmer Hall in Norfolk.They are all dressed for the autumn, with Prince Louis wearing several handmedowns, and look relaxed and happy. Ahead of her visit it was announced Kate is launching a personal crusade to highlight childrens mental health - as figures reveal suicide rates have tripled to hit a -year high.   A palace source said: As a mother of three, the Duchess is determined to raise the profile of childrens mental health as one of her key roles in the Royal Family. She is passionate about children and their wellbeing, and this focus has already been shown to be a huge part of what she sees as her work. With the Royal Foundation and Heads Together, the royals have laid a path for this subject to be discussed more openly. The Duchess believes the mental health of children and young people is one of the big challenges of our time.

Now Jacky Rom, from Romford in Essex, is desperate to trace the man caught up in the mix-up, because he was much nicer than the man she ended up meeting. Jackie had arranged to meet a man on dating app Plenty of Fish.When she arrived at the Fox and Raven in Chelmsford, she was excited to be greeted by a man with a twinkle in his eye, Essex Live reports.But sadly for her it turned out the mystery man was supposed to be on a date with someone  - and the mix-up only came to light when their real dates turned up. Now Jacky is desperate to find the man she thought she was meant to be dating.  Jacky, who has a -year-old daughter and has been single for nine months, spent Monday morning preparing for her first ever blind date, dressing to impress. She said: When I pulled up in the car park I saw a guy behind me and thought he looked nice, I did think it was a bit funny that he didnt say hello. I went inside and ordered a drink and sat down, when he walked in he came over to me straight away greeted me with a peck on the cheek and said I thought you were a red head. When he said that I didnt think much of it, because I have always had dferent coloured hair, I just thought I was pleased with my choice.   He had a twinkle in his eye and he was a gentleman, even though I wasnt what he expected when he saw me he said its ok, it doesnt matter. He then went over to the bar and got himself a drink, at which point my actual date walked in. It was only a matter of minutes that Jacky spent with the man she mistook for her date but she said: It didnt even occur to me he was the wrong person I didnt even think of that I thought oh a nice guy for a change. My actual date was no where near as nice as the other man, but we all at that point had realised what had happened and laughed about it. When the red head turned up shortly after the four went their separate ways and continued their dates.   Jacky, who is an author, said: It was so annoying, we were sat there chatting away and I was not giving him my full attention. I was thinking about pretending to go to the toilet and instead running outside and putting my business card on his car windscreen, because I knew what car he had as he followed me in. But after about  minutes they just left and I couldnt do anything, I didnt knowthey had had a good date or not. Jacky has been single for nine months and downloaded Plenty of Fish around a month ago to seeshe could find love, and this was her first ever blind date. She said: Its a shame I had the coffee with the wrong one. I would like the chance I missed. Now, having recovered from the embarrassment, she wants to track down the mystery man. The four shared a moment of awkwardness before laughing it off. Jacky described the man as being around  foot tall with an unusual haircut. She said: It was grey and it was closely shaven at the sides and longer on top, he looked very stylish and was wearing grey skinny jeans. Jacky estimated his age to be around - but she couldnt recallthe man had facial hair or not. She also described him as having a local accent. Despite downloading Tinder, match and Bumble in a bid to find the man, Jacky has had no luck and reached out to Essex Live for help. She said: I would kick myselfI didnt at least try to reach out and find him. If you were in the pub at the time or think you may know the man, or his red headed date, and would like to help Jacky please get in touch by emailing paige.ingram@reachplc.

He winces with pain as he plumps his grubby duvet and lies down, zipping the flap shut behind him Because in , roofer Steve broke his back in three places falling off a building, and sleeping on a wet, cold street is agony. “After the fall I lost my job and my home,” he croaks through a sore throat . “I came home to the Rhondda then ended up here on the streets six weeks ago. “I went to a hostel one night but got pick-pocketed while I was sleeping and the place was full of druggies.The second time I had night terrors and a member of staff woke me up by slapping me, hard. So I feel safer here. “But it’s bloody miserable. I just want my own place again, to get back on my feet.” Steve is just one of dozens of tent dwellers living in the centre of Cardf who reveal the complexity of Britain’s rough-sleeping crisis.   There were some , homeless people in Wales last year – a rise of % in  months – with , in the capital. But the number of rough sleepers in Cardf doubled in three years, to around . Last month a Tory councillor was suspended, though later reinstated, for demanding their tents be “torn down” as they were harming local businesses. And since “tentgate” made headlines, even more people have appeared under canvas on the city’s streets.But Cardf has some of the best homeless services in the UK, with hundreds of places in council and charity-run hostels and outreach teams offering support. Every night there are least  surplus bed spaces. So why does anyone need to sleep in a tent or doorway   Rough sleepers say they feel safety on the streets and maintain their independence. Charities blame the lack of social housing, rent increases, welfare reforms and the Universal Credit debacle – along with an “explosion” in spice use and substance addiction in Cardf, and an increase in mental health issues.  Those they do help into accommodation cannot always maintain it, leading to what council outreach workers call “a revolving door of homelessness”. But tent dwellers like Steve dream of having a real front door again. So does Donna. She and her husband Paul, , have been living in a tent in the pedestrian shopping area for three weeks.  They were evicted on Donna’s th birthday, when their landlord suddenly sold up. Paul has recovered from a stroke and a heart attack and beaten bowel cancer, and both he and Donna have mental health issues. “We’ve been to a hostel, but never again,” she says. “It was filthy used needles in the shower, people openly taking drugs and robbing each other. It’s no good for you. “Sleeping in doorways is far too dangerous, so a tent is the best solution.  “It keeps you warm and dry and out of the way of the shop owners trying to make a living.” She invites me in to her immaculately kept tent. We sit on a brightly coloured patchwork blanket surrounded by all her belongings, lined up neatly or packed in bags. There is even an air freshener in the corner and a pint of milk keeping cool by the door. “I take pride in keeping it nice,” she says. “I sweep it all out every day. Everything’s got to be tidy.  “And we’re on a the waiting list for accommodation, so hopefully it won’t be long before we’re out of here. I just want to get back behind my own front door again.” But for now, like Steve and the other tent dwellers, a zipped-up a flap of canvas will have to do.

Job applicant Victoria Atkins, , applied for a role at Intenso Espresso in Hove, East Sussex, and went for a trial sht after passing the interview stage. But, when she was unable to make her sht due to bad weather, Victoria claims she was sent a series of rude messages from Jullian Preston-Powers. Jullian, who claims to have a supervisory role at the cafe and is married to the owner, slammed her no-show, claiming a poor work ethic... is highly synonymous with being British. The businessman went on to state that staff cannot ever call in sick and that he would dock wages from a previous shtthey did so without a doctors note. He went on to champion one staff member who hadnt had a day off in three years because that was normal for thin, healthy people who dont eat bacon.   Victoria said she was very, very offended and branded his statements about British workers nasty. However, when approached for comment, Jullian defended and reiterated his stance that the very poorest type of employee is a British one, full stop. The Trades Union Congress slammed his actions and defended British workers, who they claim put in some of the longest hours in Europe. Victoria, from Brighton, East Sussex, said: He is very rude and nasty. I felt disgusted in his expectations and it just goes to show how hes not an understanding, professional business owner at all. Id had a really bad morning and just askedI could rebook the trial sht. Id taken the bus and left plenty of time, but due to delays I soon realised I would be late. By this time I was soaking wet because the bus only went half way, and my friend lives on the same road as the cafe so I went there to shower and dry off. I was already a couple of hours late so askedI could go at a later date, which is when he said no. Dont get me wrong, I understand why he didnt let me just do another sht, but his comments about British people having no work ethic were shocking.   Victoria claims the member of staff who interviewed her had been polite and really lovely and even offered her a trial sht, however she felt very, very offended by the comments made by Jullian. His responses to her texts left her feeling that she was grateful he showed who he really is before she accepted a job. Victoria said: [The member of staff] was really lovely and after the interview she asked me to come back for a trial sht the next day. I feel sorry for the stafftheyre going into work ill because theyre scared of losing pay. Ive worked in the food and drinks industry for years and used to be a barista at [popular coffee chain] and trained as a maestro. I also took management courses. I had plenty of experience and knew how to do the job well. When he made the comment about eating bacon, I was very, very offended. I never even met him and Im happy as a size . He wasnt even at my job interview. Its like saying all British people are fat when especially in Brighton, we are known for lots of vegans. In his message, Jullian wrote: Sorry you are having a stressful morning. Its probably better you did not succeed in getting the job because you can never be late for or miss work at our business. Ever.   You cannot ever even call in sick as that is not allowed. Literally, you have to be at work as scheduled with us andyou do not, you get a whole days wages from your previous sht docked and then are sackedit happens just once again. We are British, but generally cannot ever manage to hire British due to poor work ethics. When Victoria replied saying how dare he be rude to her because she is British and that he was an awful business owner, Jullian carried on in further messages. His second message read: Not because you are British, because you managed to show poor work ethic before even getting a job - which is HIGHLY synonymous with being British! [OMITTED] is perfectly happy and has been with us into her third year now. She has a well paying job and has never, not once, called in sick. Victoria responded: Well its not normal to never be sick in the space of three years. Maybe she is spreading her germs about the cafe haha og well Im done now good luck to you. Jullian then said: Yes, it is normal for thin, healthy people who dont eat bacon. Victoria wrote back: Im not fat, thank you. Im very happy with my body.   In response to allegations made by Victoria, Jullian stood by his belief that British people have poor work ethic and claims every single British person he has employed in the past has had issues. He said his business experience was that the work ethic of Brits are inferior to those of from Eastern Europe. Jullian said: Our experience of running a small, private, family-run coffee shop in Hove is that the very poorest type of employee is a British one. Full stop. The last candidate you want to take on - and we try ardently to hire everyone - is British. It is true, comprehensively, that every single one of the British employees that weve had will call in and have some issues, or be late. Be very dferent employee to have. But when you have someone who comes from a country where there are no jobs and appreciate they have a job, they work every single hour. Its just a preference and making it very clear and being honest about what genre of people have the best work ethic. We dont not employ British people, the business employs three British people. Were British and we hire British people. In his text messages to Victoria, he also claimed he would dock the pay of an employees previous shtthey call in sick without a doctors note. He admits he operates outside of the legal position to ensure the business is not affected.   Jullian said: The legal position is that you can self-certy, but we work outside of that. We specically use policies that are beneficial to small businesses. We have a policy thatyou dont show up for work, for whatever reason, the entire previous sht will be docked from your wages, unless you can provide a doctors note to prove youre too sick to work. What British people do specically is they really take advantage of the fact they have a benefit system and theyre not motivated to earn money. If you were someone who was to have your day off and the manager calls you up to say Im very sorry, [someone] didnt turn up for work. The shops still closed - can you go in, what we do for that person is pay them double pay. If someone worked eight hours the day before then doesnt show up for work, their previous sht pays for the double pay for the other person, because why should the business have to pay for that  Statisticallyyou there were ever such an analysis drawn across peoples backgrounds and where they were from, there would be a massive spike in British absences unfortunately. In his final message, Jullian mentions that one of his employees had managed three years without a sick day because she doesnt eat bacon. He claims this was in response to her new diet and that she was thin - but admitted hed never met Victoria in person and made no judgemental condescension as to her weight or diet. Jullian said: Ive had hundreds of messages of support coming through. We just recently employed a British man who is  years old who has been working in the coffee business for many, many years.[An employee] and I had a meeting this morning - this woman [Victoria] has caused hundreds of people to put negative reviews all over TripAdvisor, Facebook and Googl , so its been quite detrimental to the business.A TUC spokesperson said: If hes looking for the title of Britains Worst Boss, it sounds like hes going about it the right way. Its illegal to discriminate against job applicants based on their ethnicity. And profiteering from staff illness by docking their wages is very likely illegal too. Britains workers have a very strong work ethic. They put in some of the longest hours in Europe and billions of pounds worth of unpaid overtime each year. In , the outspoken businessman told a -year-old member of staff to quit smoking or shed be fired - and successfully helped her kick the habit.

Larissa was left virtually bedbound when her symptoms were at their worst and even having a shower became too painful and left her skin red raw. She has released a graphic photo diary showing how bad her reaction to ditching the creams really was as she admits there wee times she wouldnt leave the house because she was so worried people would stare.  But now the -year-old now manages her eczema holistically - and wants to use her horric experiences to encourage doctors to think twice before prescribing steroid cream.Larissa, who lives with her partner, Robbie Taylor, , in Portsmouth, Hampshire, severe reaction came after she developed topical steroid withdrawal . She had decided to wean herself off steroids because, over time, they had become less and less effective. TSW is a little-known condition causing painful and traumatic reactions when people try weaning themselves off steroid creams.   Larissa said: “When I stopped using the creams, Robbie and I had just bought our first house together. “It should have been this wonderful time, but instead I was bedbound with the pain. I’m only in my s, but I felt like I was . “I knew how important it was to push myself to get out and see people or do things, but I just wanted to hide. I was so worried people would stare, and when it’s something like skin that you can’t even cover up, it’s all the more soul-destroying.”  Larissa, who teaches navigation, was first diagnosed with eczema when she was just nine-months-old. With doctors hoping she would eventually grow out of it, she intermittently used small doses of prescribed steroid creams throughout her childhood. Larissa said: “I’d find that sunshine and sea water were a massive help. “I remember my eczema being particularly bad on my joints and how I’d get told off for scratching in class. “But, now I think back, it’s nowhere near as severe as dealing with TSW.”  Instead of easing, her eczema became more severe as an adult, although stress was the only trigger she could identy. Larissa said: “I look back now and try to figure out patterns, examining what was happening in my le at particular points and trying to work out why that’d make it better or worse. “The major trigger I found was stress. I tried my best to minimise it in my le, but sometimes, it’s out of our control. “There is an awful lot of pressure in le now. People are so busy and want to do everything as fast as possible. Then there’s also things like social media, and how it makes us compare ourselves to others.  “They sound like little micro-stresses, but they can all add up without you realising.”As her skin condition became more severe, Larissas use of steroid cream increased until eventually, by around , she was applying it every few hours having been told to use as much as she needed.But the more she used, the less effective it became. Larissa said: “You see that word steroid and know it’s not something you want to be using every single day. “By the end, I was getting no relief whatsoever from the creams.  “I was still having to bandage my wrists and arms every night to minimise scratching in my sleep, and had to be incredibly careful about what products or materials I put on my skin. “I used to love cosmetics, and have this whole vanity case of lovely makeup that I can’t use. I could only apply moisturiser to my face, or use prescribed shower gel. “It made it even harder that there was nothing I could do to cover up my skin.” At the end of January , she ditched the steroid creams for good, but was completely unprepared for the severe reaction to come. By March, Larissas skin – particularly on her face – felt tight, red and raw, asshe had been burned. Then, after posting photos to some online eczema support groups for advice, a fellow sufferer mentioned TSW for the first time. She became convinced this was what was cuasing her problems. Larissa said: “I contacted some friends that work in medicine and they sent me over some studies to read. “The condition is such an unknown, especially as controlled studies are virtually impossible, as they’d mean withholding eczema treatment from somebody who really needs it.  “But the only change I could think of that had sparked this was coming off the creams. “I made an emergency dermatology appointment, but things went downhill very quickly. It got to the point where even showering would leave me in tears, as it was so painful and my skin was so raw I couldn’t even wear underwear.” Eventually, her entire body affected, Larissa had no choice but to start a course of the immunosuppressant drug cyclosporin. She has also been seeing a naturopath to discuss alternative therapies, as well as a hypnotherapist and cognitive behavioural therapist to deal with the emotional turmoil. Larissa said: “People don’t understand, and think it sounds silly to be saying this about a skin condition, but there were genuinely times when I wondered how I was going to get through,the rest of my le was going to be like this,” she admitted. “Everyday things that you take for granted were so dficult, like undressing for a shower. Not only was it painful – I also didn’t want to have to look at myself. “Thankfully, I am feeling much stronger, though the not knowing why this happened, and living with something so unpredictable is still very tough.” Larissa, who has now moved on from taking cyclosporin and is beginning a course of an antibody called duplimab, is urging doctors to treat eczema patients such as herself holistically, rather than simply prescribing steroid creams. She said: “There is a time and a place for steroid treatments. Everyone is dferent and they can help some people, but we also need to be looking at triggers like stress and diet. Every journey is dferent, and iniduals need to do what they can to help themselves. “There is, in my mind, a clear link between mental health and skin conditions. Stress is a huge trigger, and you are bound to feel low when there is no end in sight and every little thing you do is a huge decision about whether it’ll make your skin better or worse. “We are getting better at talking about mental health but we still need to be changing our approach and looking at things as a whole.” "},{"url":null,"title":"third salisbury novichok assassin may","story":"NewsThird Salisbury Novichok assassin may still be in UK after aborting escape planIt is believed a third man flew into the UK at the same time as the agents who attempted to murder Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia, but there is no record of him leavingShareCommentsByJoshua TaylorDeputy news editor:,  FEB Updated:,  FEB Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video skripal-poisoning-suspects-say-were-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News ,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News ,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email A third Salisbury Novichok assassin may still be at large in Britain, according to reports.The Russian intelligence officer is believed to have travelled to the UK under a  name on the same day as the two hitmen who tried to assassinate Sergei and Yulia Skripal last year.The third man, travelling under the name Sergey Fedotov, was reportedly booked onto the same flight home as Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov - the two ex-Russian soldiers wanted over the murder plot.But Fedotov changed his travel plans at the last minute and did not board the plane, according to a security source.

The strong winds are expected to hit the morning rush hour today and more blustery weather is forecast into the weekend. Forecasters have told drivers to be careful of tricky conditions on roads as transport could be affected. The QEII Bridge at the Dartford Crossing has been closed for public safety due to overhead winds of over mph and strong crosswinds, Essex Live reports. Southbound traffic on the M will instead have to travel through the East tunnel, which has a height restriction of five metres. This is expected to cause long delays around the Dartford Crossing and surrounding roads today. The Met Office has put a warning for wind in place. The warning covers Wales and southern and central parts of England. More than  homes in Cornwall were blacked out as the mph winds sent trees crashing across power lines this morning.   The M motorway is closed after a serious road traffic collision between junctions  and  in Leicestershire. The northbound section of the road is not expected to re-open until after rush hour after an accident involving a lorry and other vehicles. The fire service said it is expected to stay shut for a signicant amount of time. In further travel disruption, the M Severn Bridge in South Gloucestershire was closed in both directions earlier this morning but is now reopened.  Overnight winds reached mph on the Isle of Wight, and mph on the Isles of Scilly off the coast of Cornwall. Meteorologist Mark Wilson told motorists they should take care. He said: Be mindful that there could be some tricky conditions on the roads, for example there will be strong winds that could affect transport, like high-sided vehicles crossing bridges, so there could be delays. While winds will ease off into breezy weather mid-morning, leaving sunshine and showers, gusts are due to pick up again by midday on Friday, with a warning from then covering most of the UK and remaining in place until Saturday evening. This will be accompanied by a warning for persistent heavy rain in Scotland, where as much as mm is forecast to fall over high ground.   Temperatures will stay mild on Thursday, with highs of Cin Scotland and Cin the south of England, Mr Wilson added. But today will see rain, snow and strong winds slowly clearing, followed by sunny spells and blustery showers, mainly in the west. Showers could be heavy at times and wintry over the hills, the Met Office said.  Friday will be very windy and rainy with -mph gusts and a risk of flooding carrying over into Saturday morning. The Met Office warned: Heavy rain will move eastwards through Friday, with frequent heavy showers following. Melting of snow will also contribute to the risk of #flooding. Strong winds are expected to last into Saturday with scattered showers. Sunday could be drier and less windy, but the south could see further wet and windy weather.

Amanda said: Being fat makes me happy, physically and sexually. Introduced to feederism by a friend in , Amanda is known as a gainer, or feedee - someone who likes the physical act of getting bigger, so either increases their size by overeating or by using padding to make themselves larger. There are also feeders, who like to watch others getting bigger and encourage their weight gain. She said: I was shy about feederism at first.

The figures are damning: the number of people living in the streets has risen by % since the Conservatives came to power, more than  die sleeping rough each year, , households are homeless. But statistics never tell the full story. That is why the Mirror wanted to give voice to those who have fallen on hard times. Their stories are of people who have struggled with addiction, people with mental health problems and people with nowhere  to turn. They are scared, lonely and destitute. Many tell of how they have been assaulted, had their tents stolen and let down by the services supposed to support them. There are also stories of great kindness and compassion. The volunteers who get up at the crack of dawn to check on rough sleepers in their area, the charities which provide vital support and the health workers who have mended broken lives. Above all, we heard time and time again from people who never thought they would be in this position.  As one homeless person told us: “people are a tissue-thin slice away from disaster, they just don’t think about it.” In a country as rich as Britain this shouldn’t be the case. We are seeing the consequences of a government which stopped caring. The safety net which should be there has been torn to shreds. You could point to the Universal Credit or the shortage of accommodation or the lack of drug treatment services or the paucity of mental health provision. All are responsible for the rise in rough sleeping and all flow from the cuts imposed by this Tory government. What makes this so shameful is there is a better way. The Housing First strategy pursued in Scotland is transforming lives by giving people a secure home and support for addiction or mental health problems. If the Government is serious about tackling rough sleeping it should follow this approach. We have given those on the streets a voice. Now we need to give them hope.

Nine-year-old Khushpreet Kaur was left screaming in agony in the freak accident that tore off large parts of her scalp. The youngsters head was torn apart by a tractors crop spraying machine in rural India .She was sitting on top of her uncles tractor, when her dress got caught, dragging her helplessly towards the machinery. Her dress became tangled up in the spinning sprayer, which led to her hair getting caught and wound around its rotating parts. Her hair was pulled clean from her head.   The horric ordeal happened on November  last year when Khushpreet was riding on top of her uncles tractor in Dharampura village in Punjab, India. He was watering a field of orange orchards when he discovered his niece covered in blood and missing half her scalp. She was rushed to hospital km away in Bathinda, where surgeons performed an eight hour long operation to reattach her forehead and scalp.   Aspiring school teacher, Khushpreet, spent  days recovering in intensive care at the Cosmo Superspeciality Hospital following the operation. She has now fully recovered and her hair is beginning to grow back. Lead cosmetic surgeon, Dr Raman Goyal, says he had to cancel other operations to prioritise Khushpreets urgent medical emergency.   He said: Khushpreets complete scalp and the skin of her forehead had peeled off in the accident. As soon as she was brought in we decided to conduct micro vascular repair of the scalp and reattach the same. The complex surgery lasted for about eight hours.

Her sweet Giovanna had always had a small pot belly, but watching her train, she could see her stomach was clearly jutting out. And later, when feeling the schoolgirls protruding stomach, she was shocked to find what appeared to be a five-month baby bump. I fretted, imagining the worst, Ange recalled. With her daughters stomach rock hard, she began asking herself terrying questions, like whether the teen could have been assaulted. But it would later turn out that Giovanna wasnt expecting. Instead, she had silent killer oian cancer - with the mystery bump actually a football-sized tumour on her oy.And in July , despite gruelling chemotherapy, Giovanna peacefully passed away, surrounded by her heartbroken family. The courageous teen had only recently turned . Our daughter is the bravest, strongest, most beautul person I ever knew, Ange, from Merbein, Australia, toldtoday. And I am so proud and honoured that she chose me to be her mum. In a message to other parents, she added: Always talk with your children about their health and being aware of changes in their body.  Have the dialogue open and teach them that they can advocate for their health. Education is key in our children learning more about their bodies as well as silent illnesses that can arise. Bubbly Giovanna, known affectionately as G, had been taking part in netball training when her coach approached her mum. She asked her, Is Giovanna pregnant , leaving her furious.In a beautul letter to her daughter, published on Kidspot , Ange recalls: What the hell  She’s only a kid! I fumed inwardly.But that night, the mum gently asked her daughter whether she could feel her stomach - and discovered the apparent baby bump. Putting my hands on your stomach, it felt like a five-month baby bump and hard as a rock, she writes in the letter.  The following day, Giovanna was taken to the doctors, where she did a pregnancy test before being rushed for an ultrasound. The scan revealed her enormous growth. And later, after undergoing surgery to remove her -kilo tumour, the brave teenager was diagnosed with oian cancer. They removed her oy along with a kg tumour, Ange told us. Giovanna recovered in hospital for the next five days. By this time disbelief had worn off and we were all upbeat about going home, and of course Giovanna was over the moon with her now new figure and flat tummy. [But on] May , , we were rushed down to Melbourne to be told Giovanna had oian cancer. The schoolgirl, who had undergone the operation at Victorias Royal Childrens Hospital, subsequently underwent chemotherapy.  She had her first round of treatment on her th birthday. While her main concern was the thought of losing her hair, her mum feared that she may not be able to have children in the future. Little did we know this was not our main concern, Ange said. She added: All she wanted for her birthday was a party with all her friends, so two weeks after her chemo  of her best friends joined her in celebrating her th birthday. She said afterwards that it was the best night of her le. I am so glad and thankful that we did this, it is even more special now as it was to be her last birthday. Giovanna, who had also been suffering from tiredness before her diagnosis, was rushed back to hospital at the end of May .  She was in agonising pain, with her stomach growing once again. And this time, it swelled to the size of a nine-month baby bump. I even had to buy you a pair of size- pyjama pants, Ange, who also has a son, Nando, writes in her touching letter to her daughter. After spending a week at Royal Childrens Hospital, Giovanna was transferred to the Royal Womens Hospital in Parkville, Melbourne. Despite medics best efforts, her organs began shutting down and she was sedated to ease her pain, as her family stayed beside her. And at .pm on July , the schoolgirl lost her courageous battle, as her distraught mum sobbed: Go darling, fly with the angels. Her final, selfless wish was for her family to raise money to fund Ronald McDonald Houses, which provide a home away from home for seriously ill children and their loved ones.   Today, Ange and her husband Fred are living every persons worst nightmare, suffering from a dull ache that is constantly present.But in honour of their beloved daughter, they have set up Giovannas Gt , a charity which raises awareness and money for oian cancer research and Ronald McDonald Houses.The couple, who are determined to make sure no-one  has to walk in their shoes, fund a room at the Ronald McDonald House in Parkville in memory of Giovanna. And they also raise much-needed funds for teenagers with cancer who at times are the forgotten ones when it comes to gts and items of need.   They are desperate to spare other families the same pain they are going through. Oian cancer, the silent killer, is not so well known as its cousin, breast cancer, yet can be far more dangerous, Ange said. Oian cancer is one of the most common types of cancer among women, but its symptoms can be dficult to recognise.According to the NHS , they include a swollen stomach, feeling constantly bloated, stomach or pelvic discomfort, feeling full quickly when eating, and needing to urinate more often than normal.

That happens with late goals but we still have to take confidence because it still was a good performance.“I came in two weeks ago and we had five new boys on the deadline.“They’ve only trained once so it was always going to be hard but in periods of the game you could see we can all play together and how it can come off.“Hopefully, we can show more of that in the upcoming games.“It’s always disappointing to concede a last-minute goal but I think the boys worked their socks off. The performance might not have been as good as against Motherwell and Hearts but every one of us certainly put everything in.“Unfortunately, a strike like that happens and you can’t do anything about it.”Despite only signing for the Dark Blues on January , Dales has already featured five times for the club and is set for his sixth turn-out in tonight’s clash at home to high-flying Kilmarnock.It’s been a non-stop start to le at Dens Park for the -year-old who is enjoying le already in the Scottish top flight and is hoping to experience his first victory in dark blue in just over  hours’ time.He added: “I think I’ve settled in quite well.“It’s definitely dferent up here, it’s a lot quicker, up and down all the time but I think that suits me.“That’s my game, to be dynamic, so I think it probably suits me more up here than down in League One.“I’ve only been here a couple of weeks and I’ve already played four-and-a-half games in two weeks.“Some of the others have played five so it has been pretty thick and fast butwe can put another good performance on again I think we can get the three points.“It’s a great opportunity to do that as long as we work as hard as we did on Saturday. If all the lads put in % like that I don’t see why we can’t get the three points.”Despite coming in from mid-table League One side Scunthorpe to join Dundee’s push to avoid relegation from the Premiership, Dales says he’s up for the challenge.“Some people prefer to go into a promotion-chasing team but, for me, there’s nothing wrong with being in a relegation battle.“I’m up for that and I think every single player in the changing-room is definitely up for it.“With the quality we have and,we can keep showing that for most of the game, there’s no reason why we can’t get to where we should be.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/02/5c5435fee7f0d9.26716581.jpg ","title":"dundee united loan signing charlie seaman wants to return to bournemouth with medal","story":"Dundee United loan signing Charlie Seaman has come to Dundee United to develop as a player and get first-team experience.And he also aims to be heading back to parent club Bournemouth this summer with a Scottish Championship medal in his pocket.In capturing the -year-old full-back from one of the surprise success stories of the English Premier League over the past few seasons, Tangerines boss Robbie Neilson stressed the deal was exactly what it said on the tin – a loan.The end of the season will see Seaman head back to the south coast and be expected to challenge for a top-team place with the Cherries.However, while his time in Scotland will be a learning experience, the former West Ham youth wants success as well.“Hopefully, coming here and learning dferent things will help me for when I go back for next season,” he said.“I can learn dferent styles here so I am really happy to be in Scotland with United.“The boys here love to play football and that’s good because it’s that way down at Bournemouth.“Every side of the game, though, on the ball, off the ball I am trying to learn, it’s what I’m here for. Defensively I am trying to be better and I want to be better offensively as well.“I came here to get experience of first-team football. I was waiting for my chance at Bournemouth but I felt I could get it here sooner, get some games for the rest of the season. Hopefully I will be more readyI get the opportunity when I go back, or wherever it may be.“There is a job to do for the team as well and our goal at Dundee United is to win this league. Yes, it would be nice to be finishing the season with a medal for that.”Seaman’s time north of the border hardly got off to the perfect start and, within hours of his arrival, he was tasting defeat as United went down to Ayr.His temporary manager was disappointed with the team performance at Somerset Park but did make a point of saying the new arrival had put in some good work.The young full-back took encouragement from that but has admitted he did not necessarily agree with Robbie’s assessment.“I was happy to make my debut last week, obviously disappointed with the loss, but it was good to get out there and experience something dferent,” he added.“I didn’t think I started the game too well but I thought I grew into it. Still, personally, I don’t think it was one of my better games by any stretch.“It was my first game at the club, my first playing a dferent style of football and my first playing in dferent weather conditions and stuff like that.“It was all a learning curve, something to take from that game into future games.“I came up Thursday night, so I only had a day here before the game but I have high expectations and I like to set high standards.“When I don’t reach them, I’m disappointed.”The aim now is to show up well as he makes his home debut as Morton visit Tannadice and United try to get back to winning ways to keep in touch with leaders Ross County.And Seaman does admit this week has given him more time to do his homework on the opposition, saying: “Before Ayr the gaffer gave me a lot of clips of Ayr to watch so I had a fair idea of what they were going to do.“I was relatively ready for the game in a tactical aspect but I did only come up on Thursday night.“For this game against Morton we have been getting information throughout the week. So I’ve an idea of what to expect and I am looking forward to playing in front of our own fans.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/02/5c593edc5c5222.30407689.jpg ","title":"dundee uniteds ian harkes is making his dundonian grandad very happy","story":"He had never been to the city before signing for Dundee United and, despite being born down south, Ian Harkes was so young when his family headed back to America he has no memory of his year or two in Britain.However, family ties mean moving to Dundee has been something of a homecoming for the -year-old American.As was well-documented when he signed up last month, grandad James is a Dundonian and was delighted when Ian told him he was joining boyhood heroes United.That made his impressive home debut against Morton at the weekend a special moment not just for Ian but his family back in the States and, in particular, James, who was born a stone’s throw away in Fleming Gardens.For Ian, though, just as special as those family ties is the fact he’s now playing his football in a city and country where football isn’t just a sport, it’s a way of le.“It was good to be in for my home debut at Tannadice and I thought my energy was good,” he said.“I spoke to my grandad a couple of weeks ago and he was over the moon at me signing and I’ll be speaking to him again soon because I’m sure he was delighted about me playing at Tannadice.“The whole family caught the game I think and they were pleased. I actually don’t have any relatives here in Dundee because they all moved to America but I’m sure they will be over soon to watch me in person.”And the former DC United man admits being in an environment where the population live and breathe football is a special feeling.His grandad’s love of United and the fact dad John, a former USA skipper, spent a big chunk of his career in England, means that’s not come as a surprise.“Over here everyone talks about football all the time and it’s the culture. It’s everywhere, which I love, and it’s all over the city.“There are so many competing sports back in the US that are big but football is getting bigger and at the final this year in Atlanta you saw , people there and that is great to see. The game is going to keep growing there and you will see more and more players coming through but here it’s on a dferent level.“I knew what it was like over here, I got it from my dad from when he was here. My mum and dad talked about it a lot, how everyone is immersed in the sport.“I get in taxis here and they are talking about it and all the people are. I love that.”For Ian, though, just being able to experience le in a football-mad country is not going to be enough.He’s come to United to progress his career and that means helping get them back to the Premiership and making a name for himself at that level.With the squad Robbie Neilson has put together, that’s a goal he’s convinced he will achieve.“There’s a lot of new guys in the squad and I thought you saw us start off well against Morton,” he added.“You also saw glimpses in the second half where we had to finish off the game and get that third goal and we didn’t.“However, I think in the first half the guys were moving the ball around well and getting into good positions.“Pete Pawlett was coming inside for us and Pav Safranko was stretching them. That got us the space to play and I think we got a bit away from that in the second half but it will come.“If we keep going and show our class we will finish off games a bit better.“I think, like the manager has said, there are a lot of good players who have good experience so when they get in, they just gel.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/02/5c5ac61f76f544.56248025.jpg ","title":"free cash folk throughout dundee perthshire and fife in line for cold weather payment are you eligible","story":"People throughout Dundee are in line to receive cash after the recent bout of cold weather.The Government#s Cold Weather Payment scheme dishes out £ to people living in an area where the average temperature has been C or below for seven consecutive days.Every person living in the DD postcodes endured these conditions between January  and February , it has been confirmed.Folk in Perthshire and Fe are also in line to receive a windfall due to the cold weather.Click here to seeyou are eligible."},{"url":null,"title":"raiders take car keys from dundee home then drive off with owners ford fusion car","story":"Police are appealing for information after a raid on a Dundee home.A break-in took place in Argyle Street between January  and February .Car keys were taken prior to the vehicle # a Ford Fusion car, registration GP MBY # being stolen.Televisions and bikes were also stolen.A police statement said: #Call you know where the car or property is.

That could change in Saturday’s Scottish Cup visit to St Mirren and at the very least he will provide experienced cover for Benjamin Siegrist.Charlie SeamanIt was a dficult start for the Bournemouth kid as he made his debut in the defeat at Ayr United just hours after flying north to begin his loan. The -year-old, however, did reasonably well at Somerset Park and looked good as he made his home debut in Saturday’s win over Morton.Mark ReynoldsThe vastly-experienced Aberdeen defender showed his ability and know-how as he strolled through his debut against the Ton, despite injury meaning that was his first competitive outing since last May. Reynolds was handed the captain’s armband and showed leadership qualities that could prove vital in the coming months.Mark ConnollyThe arrival from Crawley Town is another centre-half and Saturday saw him show instant signs of being able to form a solid partnership with Reynolds. The Irishman is a no-nonsense defender who looks perfect for the physical requirements of the Championship.Calum ButcherBack for a second spell at United having previously played at Tannadice under Jackie McNamara, the midfielder was brought in to add bite in that area of the park. He lasted an hour at the weekend and in that time won his tackles and had a big influence on those around him in the middle of the park.Ian HarkesThe -year-old American was something of a surprise arrival but with his energetic box-to-box running has shown why Robbie Neilson wanted him. The former DC United team-mate of Wayne Rooney covered a lot of ground and, as he showed in the Scottish Cup win at Montrose, also has a goal in him.Morgaro GomisAnother who is ing to United, in his case for a third spell in tangerine. Gomis blotted his copy book by picking up a red card in that defeat at Ayr. Now , the  Scottish Cup winner is unlikely to start every game but will provide good cover in central midfield.Peter PawlettThe manager spent most of last month working to secure the services of the former Aberdeen man who played for him at MK Dons. Pawlett wasted no time showing why with a superb debut against Morton that saw him grab his first United goal. His pace, use of the ball and movement off it means he will be a very big player.Cammy SmithThe third of the arrivals who have played for United before. Smith has fitted in well since joining up from St Mirren. He goes about his work in quietly but his knowledge of how to win promotion from this ision makes him an asset.Aidan NesbittAnother who played for Neilson at MK Dons. The former Celtic kid has signed until the end of the season and so far only one of his five appearances have been as a starter. At , the attacker could be one for the future –he can add goals to the nice touches seen so far.Osman SowAnother ex-MK Don and the Swedish striker also played for Neilson during a successful spell at Hearts. The -year-old has had a lack of game time buthe can get his match fitness back quickly there is no question he has the ability to get goals in this

Norman said that in the early hours of Monday morning the charity’s outreach team found a lad sleeping rough in the West End of the city.“As he was freezing cold we got him into our warm van, gave him a hot chocolate and sleeping bag.“We contacted Dundee City Council’s homeless services and due to complications which we can’t ulge they were unable to offer immediate support.“We arranged for him to

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13926204.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_18355078.jpg","title":"ayr united 2 inverness 3","story":"NewsAyr United  Inverness : John Roberston hails Somerset Park among best grounds in worldThe Inverness gaffer was full of praise for the old fashioned surroundings as his side clung on in the face of a stirring fightback.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN NewsNathan Austin puts Caley - up \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailJohn Robertson hailed Somerset Park as one of the best grounds in the WORLD after Caley held off a storming Ayr fightback. Inverness were three up and on easy street after a crazy opening  minutes which saw United gt-wrap the game. But a Lawrence Shankland inspired comeback almost grabbed a share of the spoils for Ian McCalls title contenders. A relieved Robertson said: Had it finished - you wouldnt have been surprised. Somerset Park is one of these grounds that sucks you inyou give them a snf. Its a good throwback and their fans make it intimidating and a good atmosphere for teams when you lose a goal. Its brilliant...one of the best grounds in the world to come and play your football. In the past we might have lost a game like this so Im delighted.  Ayr knew a win here would take them top of the Championship and started well with Robbie Crawford missing a good chance in the first minute. But they soon hit the self destruct button as their defence went AWOL to allow Nathan Austin in for a double before Liam Polworth rammed home a third. The game looked over with barely  minutes on the clock and shellshocked Ayr took time to regroup. Coventry-bound Michael Rose rocked the post with a header before Michael Moffat drew a fingertip save from Cammy Mackay. McCall turned to the bench at half time and introduced top gun Shankland who immediately turned the tide. He set up Declan McDaid to haul Ayr back into the contest with a close range finish eight minutes after the restart. And a resurgent Ayr thought they had a penalty when Carl Tremarco appeared to handle in the box but ref Nick Walsh waved away loud protests. United continued to pour forward as the clock ticked down and Shankland set up a grandstand finish when slamming home a  yard free kick with five minutes left.  But their comeback proved too little too late as Inverness clung on. Ayr boss McCall said: Im just gutted. Weve conceded three goals and at least two of them were gted with just crazy defending. And were the team with the best defensive record in the league. I think a draw would’ve been fair but it’s just one of those nights.

The iconic property, near Ayr Central, went under the hammer last Thursday. Wilsons Auctions Land and property sales executive, Lorren Mullen were managing the auction of the ex hotel. The three and a half storey building, which has lain empty for more than  years, consists of two commercial shop units on the ground floor and sandstone units above is located on Kyle Street. It had a guide price of pound,. A spokesman for Wilsons Auctions Land  Property Sales, said: “Unfortunately we cannot disclose any further detail on this property in terms of the identity of the purchaser or the sale price . “However this figure will be disclosed by the Registers of Scotland and the Ei Group in the coming months.” In May, the Post reported how plans to knock it down and turn it into a gym were rejected by councillors. Builders Dawn Developments wanted to build a new block in its place to home a gym and shops. But the plan was cut short as council planners want the hotel preserved or refurbished instead. And the sale happened after concerns about the safety of the former hotel were discussed at this month’s Fort, Seafield, and Wallacetown Community Council held at Ayr Town Hall. One community councillor said: “It is the most dangerous building in Ayr. ” It wasn’t the only empty building t discussed at the meeting. The meeting heard how young people were putting themselves in danger by gaining access to Belleisle House One said: ”If we can show concern then the council can take action and step in..” And the meeting was told how youngsters were “masquerading around” Strathdoon House.

Now the proposition has got a whole lot dferent. Pet Heaven, a crematorium for family animals, has just opened in Ayr. And businessman Forbes Robertson believes it is the answer for many families who want to give their four legged - or two-legged in the case of birds - friends a splendid send-off. No expense has been spared in an -month project at the former commercial garage site in West Sanquhar Road. Area MP Bill Grant performed the official opening ceremony last week. The lavishly decorated gilded interior includes a parlour where families can pay their last respects. Entrepreneur Forbes, who has business interests throughout the area, revealed up to  people can attend the pet funeral services . Mourners can watch as their pet recedes behind the final curtain at the close of the service, similar to what would happen in a human ceremony at Masonhill. As yet Pet Heaven cannot handle horses, but the biggest of dogs to cats, hamsters and birds. There is a tea and coffee service as well as any choice of music desired and a book of remembrance in the reception area.  Much of the interior decoration has been gathered by Forbes, a keen antique hunter and auction room collector.

their own lives and lestyle choices, and as long as you keep within the law, the state should have no place in telling you what you can eat or drink.A motion put forward by Councillor Scott called for

to study a wider choice of subjects.At an open information evening last week, head teacher David Fyfe updated parents on the progress the school has made since its HM inspection last year, and spoke about plans to increase the number of subjects currently on offer, as suggested by inspectors.In order to provide six subjects in the senior phase, the school is considering increasing the number of periods in the week to seven a day.Consultation with pupils and staff began in August last year, and Mr Fyfe emphasised how much the opinions of parents are valued in the process.The school is looking at a choice of two new timetable models: Monday to Friday with seven periods, giving  periods a week or three days a week with seven periods and two days a week with six, giving  periods a week.At the moment, there are  periods a week.In addition to the timetable change, S and S students will maximise their time in school instead of being able to #sign out#.Pupils will be encouraged to study additional subjects, assist junior students in class, and volunteer in the community to gain Saltire Awards.Special arrangements will still be possible to enable other wider achievements such as gaining a driving licence.Mr Fyfe said: #We want our young people to make the best use of their time at school and gain valuable experiences which will benefit them when they leave.#S and S pupils will soon be required to give their initial option choices to allow the school to judge demand for each subject, although these will not be final.Mr Fyfe also shared the results of a parents and partners survey on the school#s visions and values and #rights respecting schools# charter.He said: #So far we have had  responses but there is still time for you to let us hear your views.#We really value input from parents so it is vital that as many people as possible come forward and make their opinions known.#The survey showed that . per cent of parents felt that the school#s aims, outlined in last week#s Courier, either fully capture what is important to the school, or capture it well.The survey also found, however, that . per cent of those who responded felt that they had #not been

midpoint of winter, half way between the shortest day and the spring equinox.For Christians it has a particularly special meaning as it was  days after the birth of Jesus and the day when, according

around Candlemas and one of the most interesting came from Scotland.In the olden days, Candlemas was the day when children brought candles to school so that the classrooms would have light on dull days.As time went on, gas lighting took over from candlelight and the children brought money to school with which the teacher was supposed to buy sweets for the children.The child who brought in the most money was declared Candlemas King or Queen and they ruled for six weeks.They had the power to make one whole afternoon a week a playtime and to excuse anyone they wished from any form of punishment.I don#t think this will catch on in Argyll!I think it is a lovely custom to take a child to church or temple for a blessing and to give thanks to God for their birth.I have the privilege of

It was a cold day but my friend, who is skilled in bushcraft, had brought his portable fire pit with him.We searched for drtwood and sat by the fire, roasting marshmallows and warming our hands. It was a short walk but dramatic rock formations loomed above us, making it feel like a real adventure. The kids climbed them and explored the rocky beach, where once there had been an open-air bathing pool.On our , we went through a small tunnel-like arch. I stopped for a moment, suddenly taken by the view. The ruins of Dunbar Castle were beautully framed by the archway. Locals call this archway the keyhole and I reflected that the term is a perfect name.When we look through a keyhole, our vision is narrowly focussed. Such was the effect here. It cast a visual spotlight on what is left of what was once a mighty fortress.The kids trundled on before me, noticing smaller wonders: a frozen worm on the path, a sea shell and interesting-looking stones. But I stood for some moments, taking in the view beyond and thinking of what stories those old stones of the castle could tell.Many people pass this way every day, both locals and visitors. Itrsquos a section of the John Muir Way. I have often been with my family to Dunbar Leisure Pool and the harbour and town. But somehow I had missed this short but spectacular nearby walk until this day.Dunbar Castle is now but a fallen-down ruin. Indeed, itrsquos dficult to imagine what it once was. But the weathered sandstone castles on the shoreline built by nature still stand defiant, somehow reminding us of their greater permanence in the face of human transience. But as I stood looking at the ruins, the keyhole focussed my thoughts as well as my vision.History is also viewed through a keyhole, a very narrow one. The lives and events of the castle were lived in most part unrecorded by it. The spotlight of history has illuminated only brief moments, and even then the characters have been only those deemed lsquoimportantrsquo.There are moments where the view through the narrow keyhole of history has included insights to untold stories. The bravery of Black Agnes, as she defied the siege in , is one of those. With her husband away, she was in charge of this important fortress during war with England. She refused to give up the castle, even in the face of bombardment and attempts to starve her small garrison into submission. Her mocking of her besiegers by dusting down the battlements with her maids after a bombardment is an image seared in legend.But itrsquos a chink of light on a huge untold story we are led to believe by historyrsquos silence that women were insignicant players in events. For sure they were oppressed and put down by a system that centred on male power, but they are half of humanity and at least half the story.As the actions of Black Agnes reveal, even with such constraints put on them, women were there, part of events and often refusing to accept their assigned role.The le of Mary Queen of Scots has always been for me an example of this. Yes, she was privileged and powerful by birth, but because of this history took notice of her.Despite all the political and religious challenges she faced, it was her womanhood which men deemed her main failing. And so she was judged by dferent standards. Had she behaved with the morals of her father she would not have lasted five minutes in power. But no one raised an eyebrow because he was a man.But more than this, even though Mary was the monarch, her royal authority was deemed diluted and even less legitimate merely because she was a woman.So she understood she needed to find a husband to bring her royal authority to full strength in a country full of powerful and bullying misogynist men.She chose the dashing young Darnley, and the fact that he turned out to be dross was not, in my opinion, Maryrsquos fault. How easy it is to blame a woman for a manrsquos failings. She was taken in by him it was he who was the failure, not her.Thatrsquos what Irsquove always maintained, despite the protestations of my tutors at university. And her third husband Bothwell, well he was a disappointment as well.It is the stones of Dunbar,they could speak, who could tell us of the truth of his forced union with Mary. She had been taken there by him in April . The circumstances of this still remain debated. Was she abducted by him as later claimed, or did she go willingly It was also claimed she was raped and forced to marry Bothwell soon afterwards to save her honour . This idea has been disputed by some because Mary is said to have miscarried with twins while imprisoned at Lochleven Castle some months after, suggesting a relationship with Bothwell even before Darnleyrsquos murder. So a woman cannot be abused by a man she has had a relationship with  Really If they could talk, the stones of Dunbar would whisper the truths of those events in , and the despair and desperation of a strong and clever woman whose destiny was stolen mainly because of her sex.These were my thoughts as I stood looking through the keyhole towards Dunbar Castle. Suddenly, my daughter Manja broke my trance by wiggling the frozen worm in front of me. I smiled and thought to myself that thankfully times have changed since the days when the castle was a fortress.But sometimes, I fear, not as much as we think they have."},{"url":null,"title":"new-fidra-gin-hoping-for-east-lothian-base","story":"Fidra Gin is the brainchild of Emma Bouglet and Jo Brydie and is currently based at Ballencrieff and Aviemore.The duo came together to create the juniper berry-based drink and have already enjoyed immediate success, with the product already available in a number of Edinburgh restaurants.Now they are hoping to make it  per cent based in the county, with plans under way to find suitable premises.Emma said: ldquoWe pick all the botanicals in East Lothian and, at the moment, we use a still in Aviemore.ldquoA friend has lent us his still for the time being so we can get enough momentum behind us and bring the whole operation to East Lothian.ldquoWe have potentially secured a premise in East Lothian.

It will also advise on any further, long-term solution to the issues at the beach.The groyne at the northern end of the beach will provide protection over part of the northern section of the seawall, with the potential to develop a higher beach in front of the wall.Finally, armour stones will be put in place along Lamer Street to protect the seawall.Discussions on how to revitalise the East Beach, which was once a popular tourist attraction, have been ongoing for more than five years.Pippa Swan, chairwoman of the townrsquos community council, has been heavily involved in the talks to find a solution.She was hopeful the latest measure would help and told community councillors: ldquoThe rock breakwater, the design has been worked on for more than two years.ldquoIt is now the preferred design solution and is the subject of a planning application.ldquoThere has been a lot of chatter about the East Beach and I wanted you all to be aware of what is going on and to be able to speak with some authority.Stones weighing anywhere between three and six tonnes will be used as part of the project, with work expected to take place throughout the summer and into the autumn.Mrs Swan was expecting heavy machinery to be on the site and said: ldquoIt will require big machines, at least -tonne trucks, moving these rocks around.ldquoThe East Beach will be the site of quite a lot of activity over the summer and we are bound to get some negative comments.

The doorsquocot is a clue that once a residence of some signicance stood here. It was called Dolphingstone Castle. Nothing now visibly remains of the castle, but around  years ago ruins were still to be seen.It was at one time an elegant mansion, but before that, on the same site, an older castle once stood ndash now all gone, and the structures of modernity are hemming in what is left of this ancient site. A wave of new housing laps at its walls to the west, the A traffic roars past on its south, and roads surround it on other quarters.One wondersthis small slice of East Lothian history will survive the developers. I hope it does. It is a small, historic fingerprint and gives a mysterious glimpse into our countyrsquos past, in an area now being carpeted with thousands of new houses.Earlier maps suggest that Dolphingstone Castle was surrounded by woodland. So perhaps the planting of a small wood or orchard within the old walls could create an island of both nature and history amidst the tide of urbanising development in this area.Up above on the ridge of Falside Hill to the south, the restored Farsquoside Castle looks down on the developments below . It sits like an eagle perched on a high ridge, observing the land below.How dferent the landscape it surveys would have been in  when, according to an old story, a small force of hand-picked warriors descended from the castle under the cover of darkness.It was just past midnight when they left, guided by a slither of moon. It was a raiding party, bent on revenge and heading for Preston Tower in what is now Prestonpans.Tradition tells us a feud had existed between the houses of Farsquoside and Preston for some years. The cause of the feud was the breaking down of walls between the two estates and the animals of each side grazing on the land of the other. Regular, and sometimes violent, clashes had taken place.But then Hamilton of Prestonrsquos livestock had been poisoned, or so it seemed. They had drunk from a burn which flowed from Farsquoside and it was assumed the water had been deliberately poisoned. Hamilton of Preston Tower, making no investigation, sent his men on a raid of violent retribution.Farsquoside Castle was attacked and blood was shed. This was the act which the select band of warriors who had set forth from Farsquoside were to avenge.In darkness, they filed down from the ridge on a path now known as Whinney Loan. This took them down to where the new houses are now being built on the southern edge of Wallyford.From here, great care was needed lest they be seen or heard. Dolphingstone Castle lay ahead and although their grievance was not with the occupants of Dolphingstone, early discovery could ruin the element of surprise.So the raiders veered north of Dolphingstone, by way of Prestoungrange, and at dawn, with the smell of the salt pans in their noses, they set about their vengeful work.Screams and running bairns alerted the occupants of Preston Tower. Armed men were ready, for this raid was expected, although not from this direction.The walls of Preston Tower held the attackers at bay but the people of the village suffered the worst of the slaughter. What senseless violence: neighbours separated only by the brae of a hill had been whipped up into a hateful frenzy against each other. Gradually the raiders melted away, back up the hill, with blooded swords.But hate builds on hate and the reckoning was not slow in coming. The very next day, Hamilton of Preston led a force westwards. It arrived by the walls of Dolphingstone Castle and then rounded past them to head up the hill towards Farsquoside, crossing where now the A speeds by.No attempt at surprise was required, this was to be an open fight. The Lord of Farsquoside had arranged his men along the top of the ridge, looking down on the approaching force of Hamiltonrsquos men. The order to charge was given and the men of Farsquoside poured down the slope.The leaders of both sides were in the thick of the fighting. It was the Lord of Farsquoside who fell, pulled from his horse and hacked to death by Hamiltonrsquos men.Seeing the death of their leader, the men of Farsquoside fled back to the castle. But the Lady of Farsquoside, in shock and rage at the death of her husband, rallied the men. She led them out of the castle in a furious charge as the sun began to set, forcing Hamiltonrsquos men to flee back to Preston.The battle, or skirmish as some would call it, was over, and the feud had reached its bloody climax. Soon after it was discovered an infectious disease had stricken the cattle, not poisoned water. Cattle on both sides had been equally affected. No one was to blame.How easy it had been to make enemies out of neighbours based on  assumptions. We are told Hamilton attempted to make amends. But the dead could not rise and the Lady of Farsquoside was said to be devastated at the loss of her husband.

That is exactly what she is doing. For the last two years she has put Scotlandrsquos constitutional issues to the side and pushed for Scotland and the UK to remain within the customs union and single market. All and any analysis I have read has given that outcome as being in the best economic interests of the UK and Scotland, but Ms Sturgeon, the Scottish Government and Scotlandrsquos Parliament have all been dismissed with contempt.The May Government is only interested in the Tory party and the DUP. The EU has proved extremely flexible in dealing with Mmember territories in or out of the EU, so it was possible Scotland and Northern Ireland could have had a dferent status to England Wales but was never asked. Indeed it has been reported that London insisted to the EU that Scotland be denied sharing in any dferentiation on offer to others.Mr Redfern advocates for what he calls the ldquoMay compromise: trouble is that Theresa May changes the parameters of her deal on a daily basis. Donrsquot believe me ndash ask her own Tory MPs. It is the Tories who have led us to this clf edge, and it will be the Tories who tip us into the abyss. Scotland voted to stay in the EU but has zero status or leverage within the UK ldquoUnion. Ireland is respected and her interests are being protected in the EU Union. The dference is stark and should be an example to any Scot with an ounce of gumption.GR Weir, Mill Street, Ochiltree.ROBIN Gilmourdraws a somewhat simplistic comparison between Irelands long struggle for freedom from British rule and the UKs vote to leave the European Union.He is correct to state that the Republic of Ireland, over hundreds of years, fought against domination by Britain and eventually won its independence. However, Britains partition of Ireland, designed to keep the bulk of the Unionist population and heavy industry under the UK flag, sowed the seeds for future conflict in the north of Ireland.Our present vexatious issue with the Irish protocol has only arisen because the UKs decision to depart from the EU leaves Northern Ireland as, obviously, thanks to the partition of , the only part of the UK that shares a border with an EU country.The Irish Government and the EU are trying to work together with Theresa May and her Government to avoid future loss of le and conflict in Northern Ireland by ensuring that there is no hard border, now, and in the future.The only obstruction to Britain arriving at a solution at present appears to be from those who see the people on the island of Ireland as an irrelevance and a hindrance to a clean break with Brussels,despite  per cent of people in Northern Ireland voting to remain.Mr Gilmours exasperation displays an age-old condescending British attitude towards the Irish that I had hoped had evaporated into the mists of history. As he himself says, Ireland is an independent sovereign nation on a par with Britain.

pupils Tami Fadeyiand Ruairidh Cummingunveiled a ceremonial plaquePupils in the school’s choir sang two songs at the ceremony while a video documenting the construction project played alongside them.The £m project was completed last year and pupils have been at the school since August.During the building’s construction more than  pupils were taken by bus daily to nearby Midmill School for  months, following a fire in the old building back in .Temporary accommodation on site was made for the nursery children.The new library space at Kinellar SchoolThe new school is built on the same site as its predecessor. As part of the build, the project team used the opportunity to improve facilities in the village by redeveloping a derelict tennis court and constructing an enclosed children’s play park as well as additional parking for use by the school and local community.The school’s social staircase is already becoming a well-used architectural feature alongside its many other bright and airy flexible learning spaces, including the glass fronted library and learning area upstairs.Its teaching wings benefit from cleverly designed acoustics, modern set up and technology offerings in all  classrooms, and are on two levels, with lightwells connecting them.Specially commissioned artwork is also an important feature of the new school.Local artists worked with pupils to design and create a number of pieces, including a large Oak tree in the dining area symbolizing growth with leaves painted by every child.  Aberdeenshire Provost Bill Howatson said: “A great team effort has led to the delivery of an extremely high quality building on time and on budget, and we’re thankful to everyone who has played their part in that. data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Erasums students question what will happen after Brexit\"  What is the future for Erasmus students after Brexit  viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"“It stands testament to what a community can achieve by working together, right from those dark early days after the fire when local people rallied round to offer soup and sandwiches to staff, to the lovely reception pupils received from the community in Kintore.”Chair of Education and Children’s Services Committee, Councillor Gillian Owen said: “It’s not only wonderful to see the pupils at Kinellar enjoying their new school but also to reflect on what a fantastic learning experience this project has given them. In addition to the educational opportunities – working with artists, the community and the construction team – the pupils have also learned important lessons when it comes to being resilient and flexible.”Head Teacher Pamela Farquhar added: “As much as we loved our time at Kintore it is nice to be back home.“The new school was made possible thanks to Anne Gibson who sold her land to Aberdeenshire Council.“Her husband was a former head teacher here so the school has a special place in her heart.”"},{"url":null,"title":"kintore flats plans raise objections","story":"Councillors will next week debate proposals for  new affordable flats in the heart of Kintore which have attracted a host of objections.Langstane Housing Association has tabled plans for four property blocks featuring  one-bed flats and six two-bed flats on vacant waste ground on Forest Road.But  objections have been raised on the grounds of insufficient parking and road safety, increased traffic and congestion on Forest Road and the scale of the development and the adverse impact on the amenity.In a report to Aberdeenshire Council’s Garioch Area Committee which meets on Tuesday, director of infrastructure services Stephen Archer says that “on balance” while the development may have an amenity impact on the neighbouring properties, it will fall within acceptable standards.He says: “The proposal for  affordable flats would make a positive contribution to affordable housing provision in Kintore.“It is accepted that any development on this site will alter the outlook from neighbouring dwellings, however, the use of the site for a flatted development is considered compatible with the infill nature of the site and settlement location.”Councillors will be told that the pre-application consultations and discussions during the determination of the application to reduce the potential impact on the neighbouring properties has resulted in the final layout and design.But in its objection, Kintore Community Council slams the proposal, particularly in terms of inadequate parking spaces.Chair Fiona Cooper states: “The proposed parking for the development of  spaces for  residents is insufficient and would result in overspill parking on the oppositie side of the road which would obviously have a major affect on existing residents.”In terms of the scale of the development, the community council recommends a maximum of two-storeys, with Mrs Cooper adding: “The proposed development by reason of size is out of character and would have an unacceptably adverse impact on the amenities of the properties immediately opposite the site and the surrounding area by reason of overlooking and having a visually overbearing impact.”data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..!

A no deal Brexit would result in the introduction of tarfs, estimated to cost UK wine importing businesses over £ million a year.ldquoThe introduction of no deal Brexit tarfs would be a double blow for wine businesses after the Chancellor elected to single out wine for a duty rise at the Autumn Budget.From February  the duty on a bottle of wine went up by p, but add a tarf to the duty rise and VAT and this means an average priced bottle of wine, which today costs £., will cost £. in the event of no deal.Read more: How will Brexit affect your travel plans  This is an extra p a bottle more than consumers paid before the referendum result when an average priced bottle of wine was £..There could be some positive benefits for British vineyards however.It is believed that British wines will seem less expensive than its European counterparts as retailers wonrsquot be forced to hike prices because of rate or tarfs.However, British vineyards could be hit with the lack of skilled workers from the EU and vital agricultural funding streams. data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Brian McKandie\"  Murder trial jury to consider verdictviewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\" data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Martial law could be introduced to prevent riots after Brexit\"  What is martial law and why might it be introduced after Brexit  viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"The WSTA also wants confirmation that funding that was before provided by the EU will be picked up somewhere .Tamara Roberts, CEO at Ridgeview in East Sussex, said: ldquoAs we prepare for Brexit, it will be critical that the government does all it can to help English wine grow and that includes continued access to funding streams.ldquoComplete confidence in the quality of our wines has allowed us to expand production but so has access to funding streams, some of which derive from EU structural funds.At the moment, while the future is uncertain as to what will happen with Brexit come March , it may be worthwhile buying a bottle or two extra of your favourite European tipple.

He said some areas of the town, such as Shore Street and Upper Ormlie, had been designated as one-way streets some time ago but this had not been implemented. \"That needs to be corrected,\" he said at Tuesday nights meeting.Mr Potts and other community councillors felt something had to be done to address the issue of speeding and one suggestion was for more sleeping policemen to be installed in problem areas of Thurso.Councillor Rosie, who represents Thurso and Northwest Caithness on Highland Council, said what is needed is a transport review which can take a comprehensive look at the issue. \"We need a strategic look at the whole thing ndash something which covers transport management and pedestrians,\" he said.However, community councillor and former police officer Bert MacLeod urged caution. He said: \"You need to be careful you dont go overboard with this  mph limit. Modern cars can stop quicker than vehicles did in the past. We need to be sensible.\"Mr Potts claimed \"some of the driving in Thurso is abysmal\".Mr MacLeod replied: \"Why should you and I be affected because someone drives like an idiot \"He also pointed out there are problems with installing sleeping policemen on roads. New laws have been introduced as cars have been damaged by them, he said.\"It is not just a case of putting them down,\" stated Mr MacLeod.

We have been calling for more parking enforcement in Wick for a while now.\"High Street and Bridge Street are far too regularly packed with cars parked where they shouldnt be. Its an issue that has been raised time and time again by both drivers and pedestrians. Some people think they are above the rules and for too long theyve got away with it.\"He added: \"Under the current proposals Bridge Street and much of High Street will essentially become double yellows, meaning no parking at any time. This should also help stop the constant issue of people selfishly parking in areas like the Market Square.\"The parking bays there are intended only for those who are disabled badge holders but these rules are often ignored by people who just canrsquot be bothered walking.\"Councillor Sinclair said the order would give council officers the power to enforce parking restrictions once they receive the required training but, initially, existing enforcement staff would carry out the work.\"We should expect a much more regular presence than under the old system,\" he said. \"The discussions Irsquove had with the officer responsible for parking have been extremely encouraging.\"Having an enforcement officer in the town for regular and random visits is a great start butthe situation doesnrsquot improve we will still be pushing to get someone in this post locally to clamp down on rogue drivers.\"He explained that in Inverness several council employees have been trained to undertake parking enforcement duties as well as their day-to-day jobs. \"There is no reason why the same couldnrsquot be done up here. If these orders get the go-ahead, and I am confident they will, then I hope we will begin to see a dference in peoples behaviour.\"The Caithness civic leader, Councillor Willie Mackay, also backed the plan. \"It is a fantastic idea but it is the enforcement that is the key to the success of this,\" he said. \"If we can get enough staff trained up to act as traffic wardens ndash and I am pretty sure we can ndash then their presence will deter bad parking.\"Parking in the centre of Wick has been a contentious problem for some time and has often been raised by the local community council and others.

In addition, D photogrammetry is taking place so that digital D models of the wreck can be produced. By using these techniques, in essence, the team is able to digitally bring HMS Royal Oak to the surface.Survey organiser and licence-holder Emily Turton said: “The wreck of HMS Royal Oak is the final resting place of  men and boys. As the most intact underwater dreadnought-era battleship, she has an architectural grandeur befitting of any national memorial.

The planning application also covers landscaping and future restoration of the site.The application process is being handled by consultants AECOM.The council-owned quarry currently supplies stone and aggregate materials for Council roads and building projects as well as the local construction industry.  It extracts Devonian Flagstone which is highly suited to a range of crushed aggregate products, in particular as roadstone and aggregates, used for producing asphalt for road construction and maintenance, with the quarry being the only active producer of asphalt in Orkney.The activity at the quarry generates an income for the Council which is reinvested to provide and protect some of the vital services we provide in Orkney.The current quarry area is heading towards the end of its use and an expansion would safeguard supply of materials. Current output ranges between , and , tonnes of rock per year andapproved, the ha expansion will release approximately  million tonnes of additional resources, sufficient for another  years of production.Full details are available on the Council website at http:www.orkney.gov.uk Council C long-term-development-of-cursiter-quarry-in-firth.htmPersons wishing to provide comments on the proposed development can do so by writing to AECOM at fraser.blackwood@aecom or by post to Fraser Blackwood, APEX ,  Haymarket Terrace, Edinburgh, EH HD by  February .OIC says that, at this stage, comments made to Aecom are for the purposes of assisting with the scheme design and EIA process and as such are not representations to the Planning Authority.

These moves are hugely intensive and provide a short-term boost for local workers and the economy. Such projects also develop the expertise and credibility of Scotland’s already impressive pool of financial services talent. : Nicola Sturgeon: Real and growing risk of no-deal BrexitHowever, that fact remains that much high-value work generated by exporting financial services to the EU is draining out of the Scottish economy permanently.On the other hand, there are new opportunities emerging as a direct result of the Brexit effect – for example firms are bringing some foreign operations back to Britain. Whilst the inward surge is not expected to match what is being lost, we are seeing a trend of UK and foreign firms relocating parts of their business to the UK to ensure they can continue to support their UK customer base. This includes many UK insurers who had previously set up offshore subsidiaries.The driver for larger UK firms moving operations to the EU is to satisfy their European customers, who are seeking assurances that there will be no disruption to their services in the event that no withdrawal deal is reached.However, some customers have raised concerns about whether they will get the same levels of consumer protection as offered in the UK – such as the protection of the Financial Services Compensation Scheme.We are advising a range of organisations, including a number of high-growth, financial technology businesses, who are planning their international growth strategy with Brexit in mind. We are seeing particularly high levels of activity in the payments industry. Many expanding fintech businesses in Scotland have an ambitious global outlook.: Brexit: Queen to be evacuated in event of no-deal, reports claimIt would be much simpler for them to grow abroadthe EU wasn’t to suddenly become a ‘foreign’ jurisdiction. On the other hand, many of these firms already have processes in place to manage a truly international business. For those companies, the potential barriers to exporting financial services to EU are relatively simple to plan for.International trade in financial services is particularly restricted by the requirement of firms to be authorised to undertake regulated activities. This is why Brexit is a serious issue for the financial sector to contend with. Currently we are part of a common regulatory regime, so any firm authorised to provide financial services in one EU member state can effectively get permission to conduct business in any other member state, using a mechanism known as ‘passporting’. When we are no longer in the EU, UK firms will lose their rights to passport their permissions to the EU. UK firms will be subject to the same restrictions as other firms from where across the globe.The UK will be eligible to apply for equivalence in a limited number of regulated activities, but this process is not automatic. It requires the approval of the European Commission, which could take considerable time and be subject to political obstacles. If an equivalence is approved for the UK, there would be a requirement to maintain close alignment to the EU financial services regulations. The Commission has the discretion to withdraw their approval at any time, which would provide little certainty for UK firms.On the flipside, any EU firm wanting to trade here will have to satisfy the UK’s own rules. Even though no deal has been agreed at the moment, the UK Government has thus far given assurances that regardless of what happens we’ll continue to give EU firms the opportunity to continue trading whilst applying for UK permissions up to March . They must noty the UK regulators in advance of Brexit to get the temporary permissions, but this gives more certainty to EU firms trading here than the other way around as it stands.If we are looking for positives where there are some short-term benefits of a weaker pound, which helps keep inward investment into the UK on the radar as an appealing prospect, but there is a bigger foreign exchange risk for the future should our economy and currency value begin to erge signicantly from mainland Europe.We have been helping our clients to review their businesses in order to better understand how Brexit will affect them. In some cases, depending on their set-up, it turns out after a thorough analysis that there are few specic risks.However, the process has been useful as a prompt to look at their operations in detail to see where there could get more general business efficiencies and opportunities. That may be the one silver lining to emerge from the Brexit process, whether there are any more remains to be seen.Stuart Murdoch is a solicitor advocate and partner at Burness Paull LLP©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4869283.1549532873!/image/image.jpg","title":"nicola sturgeon should be reminded of david cameron when pushing for scottish independence vote","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...The country#s leading pollster has warned Nicola Sturgeon she risks following a political path set by David Cameronshe pursues a refrerendum she presumes won#t happen.Professor Sir John Curtice said pushing for IndyRef could backfire on the SNP leader in similar fashion to when ex-PM Cameron called for a vote on the UK’s place in Europe.The First Minister should instead wait out the Brexit process before deciding whether or not to back a second vote on independence, the Strathclyde University academic said.Cameron resigned the morning after the Brexit vote in .

If anything, it should be amplied.It turned into a trilogy. There was a Great Book of Skye Two in , and now we have the #Great Book of Skye Three#.That was perhaps predictable. In the first volume, Cailean Maclean commented that he had two problems in persuading Norman Macdonald to prepare the book. The first problem was to get him to start the second was to get him to stop.Three books and , pages later, the prof has stopped — or so he says.The three volumes comprise a Dictionary of Skye Biography. The lives of almost , people are profiled and illustrated inside their pages. They have all #been Skye born or bred or are people who have had an intimate connection with the island. They have all been noteworthy in one way or another… #There has never been more than , people living in Skye at any one time, and for much of history — particularly recent, recorded history — its population has been much smaller than that.Nobody, however, will be too surprised that Norman and Cailean uncovered and portrayed over a thousand eminent Sgiathanaich. Without wishing to kickstart Norman once again, the miracle is that they enumerated so few. The island, like almost all Hebridean islands, has been a breeding ground of talent and character.The only other qualication for entry in the Great Books of Skye is that you must be dead. You, dear reader, however, accomplished you might be, will not be able to read your entry unless metaphysics permits you access from your celestial cloud. These are obituaries, not panegyrics.That lends a sombre tone to certain pages of the Great Book of Skye Three. There are people featured here who, we are sharply reminded, were alive when volume one was in preparation.Here, for instance, is the smiling face of Dr Vicky Ann Galbraith, who was born in Portree in  and who died at home in Aird Bernisdale of brain cancer in .Vicky Ann was achievement personied. A leading scientist for Roche Pharmaceuticals, she also played for Scotland#s national women#s rugby union team on  occasions. Following her fatal diagnosis, she raised thousands of pounds for cancer research by leading sponsored walks from Portree to Glasgow, up the West Highland Way and where.Here is Thomas William Mackenzie. You may have known him as Tommy. He was born in  and he died last March. He was, in the GBS abbreviated subheading, a #printmaker, etcher and gallery owner, Chieftain of Skye Highland Games, boat race devotee, tug-of-war revivalist, shinty enthusiast, and half-marathon runner.#That just about covers it, as a dictionary of biography is forbidden to indulge itself and cannot add that for very many people, Tommy Mackenzie was the face and personality of modern Portree.These volumes, these hefty Great Books of Skye, are a leisurely parade along Wentworth Street and then out to the peninsulas, pausing to wave at or pass the time of day with Victorian land reformers, clan chiefs, bards, teachers, surgeons, fishermen, and climbers. It#s a verbal Skye equivalent of the cover of #Sergeant Pepper#s Lonely Hearts Club Band#.Sir Harold Boulton was not a Sgiathanach. He came from Hertfordshire and was educated at Harrow and Oxford.In  he married into the Highland quality via a Dingwall military family. Boulton already had an interest in Gaelic song and music.He enters the Great Book of Skye because, in the late th century, Boulton seems to have heard a Gaelic rowing song and put his own, English, words to the tune.Those lyrics and that tune have become internationally known as #The Skye Boat Song#. Norman Macdonald digresses wonderfully on Boulton#s creation of a supposed Jacobite anthem.We are still left with the dilemma of the bonnie boat#s journey. The original Gaelic version may have celebrated a voyage from Torrin to Loch Coruisk. For most of the th century, it was assumed to refer to Charles Edward Stuart#s post-Culloden flight by sea from the mainland to Skye.As Charles never made such a journey directly by sea, pedants have more recently suggested that Boulton must have been referring to the Pretender#s actual sea voyage It really, really, does not matter. We are in the realms of mythology. Charles may as well have been sailing from Papua New Guinea. Harold Boulton invented the whole damn thing — the misty isle#s most famous song is a Victorian concoction — and in recognition of that, he deserves his entry in the Great Book of Skye Three.And finally, here we are back in Portree. William Cowie was born in Kiltarlity in  and became an agricultural advisor in Skye in the s. The brother of a professional footballer, Cowie devoted himself to shinty and became one of the greatest players of his era.Fittingly, he married in  a grand-daughter of the captain of the Skye shinty team which had won the inaugural MacTavish Cup in .William and Margaret Cowie had two sons, Ross and William. He died too young, at the age of  years, while playing badminton in Portree Drill Hall.William Cowie would, therefore, have been shy of his th birthday had he led his natural course to June  and a day in Fort William which would have caused him, more even than the rest of Skye, unimaginable pride.It is tempting to say of all three Great Books of Skye that they are for dipping in and out rather than reading as a single narrative. The trouble with that suggestion is that once you#ve dipped in, it is very hard to dip out again.As a trilogy, they are a phenomenal publishing achievement. They should take their place, alongside the inevitable Tommy Mackenzie print, in every home in Skye."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/INDOOR-SHINTY-19-P4-7-FINAL-2.jpg","title":"skye schools indoor shinty competition all the action in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineYoung shinty players fromthroughout Skye gathered to take part in two indoor tournaments for primary school teams last weekend.Portree High’s Fingal Centre hosted competitions for P-P and for P-and-under teams.On a fast and furious day of excellent shinty action teams fromBun-sgoil Ghàidhlig Phort Rìgh won both competitions.Broadford were runners up in the P- competition, with North West taking second spot in the P-under tournament following an epic final."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/web-subs-3.jpg","title":"skye charities work to be showcased at skeabost","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineA multi-charity event will be held in Skeabost on Saturdayto highlight the work of several good causes across Skye.The event will be held at Skeabost Memorial Hall from  am until  pm and will provide information on the work carried out by a iety of charities in the area, as well as insight into the costs and challenges they face.to raise awareness of the event, which will support Skye and Lochalsh Young Carers the Skye and Lochalsh Foodbank Crossroads Care # Skye and Lochalsh Macmillan Cancer Support Skye Dance Bloodwise, and Rotjanas Hands, which Mr Williams set up with his we nearly  years ago.He said: “I have been an independent fundraiser for many years – I am a trustee of Rotjanas Hands – formally known as Hands Across the Water – which I set up alongside my we following the Indonesian Tsunami .”He added: “For me, it has always been important to share particularly when we are so fortunate and others not so.

I was born in , my family have been resident in Ballymena for generations, Allen, obviously, on my fathers side and Gribben on my mothers. My parents moved into the Demesne Estate shortly after it was built, first living in Carnduff Drive and then after a few years moving to Glenshesk Drive where they lived the rest of their lives.  I attended Ballymena Boys Secondary School. Music lessons were pretty much a non event. Every exam time each student would be hauled up to the front of class to sing a song and was awarded a C grade. My standout memory of music lessons was hearing the music teacher playing an album of Holsts Planet Suite to himself, this at least started a le long love of classical music.  In my early teens Glam rock was the big thing but apart from Bowie, T Rex, Rod Stewart etc I seldom listened to the charts.  I was more into album bands like Cream, Taste, Hendrix, early Fleetwood Mac, Pink Floyd and especially Led Zeppelin. Of course I followed the usual links from these back through Willie Dixon, Muddy Waters, Howlin Wolf to the Delta greats, Robert Johnson, Son House and Charley Patton.  First real early Blues album I heard was by Leadbelly and then Robert Johnson : The King of the Delta Blues , album which has been a major influence on my playing ever since.  I started playing bass guitar when I was about twelve then switched to six string. FLAMINGOMy first paying gig was at The Flamingo playing bass with local rockers Angel when I was fourteen.  After discovering the joys of Blues and Booze, I could be found many a night after closing time, sitting around a fire in the woods at the back of my old school, playing guitar and singing the Blues with friends.  Many Friday nights were passed in The Bridge, Dunloy listening to South Bound Train and most Saturdays were spent in The Pound or The Harp Bar in Belfast, catching as much live music as I could.  This was during the dark days of the Troubles, with bomb warnings and check points an everyday normality but somehow music lovers seemed to live in a world apart, music clubs being one of the few places religion didnt encroach on.  I have played in ious bands throughout the years, including Angel, AGS, Harpers Hill Blues Band, The Flood and BIDDY EARLY as well as playing as a solo Delta Blues player, playing slide guitar harmonica.  Lately I have seriously got into electric Blues Harp, being influenced by Sonny Boy Williamson ii, Little Walter, Paul Butterfield, John Myall, Walter Horton etc. I currently play Blues Harp with The Matchstick Men, Irelands premier Status Quo tribute act, and I also regularly sit in with Legal Tender and Blues Taxis. I can be found most first Saturdays of the month at the excellent BT Blues and Rock Club sitting in on Harp with the featured bands. For the last six years I have been host of BIDDY EARLYS Open Mic at the BT Club, one of the Provinces most successful Open Mics which I also founded. I have finally decided to call an end to it at the start of this year to concentrate on my own music.  I play ious instruments guitar,  string guitar, slide guitar, bass guitar, banjo, mandolin, auto harp, Appalachian mountain dulcimer and of course Blues Harp.  Yeah, after all these years, Ive still got the Blues, once your hooked, thats it for le! - see BB King, John Lee Hooker, Buddy Guy etc.  As for other local promoters of the Blues, theres the afore mentioned BT Blues Club which Looi Burns has been doing an excellent job of running for many years and of course local bands like Legal Tender and Blues Taxis.

The knocker-up used a baton or short, heavy stick to knock on the clients doors or a long and light stick, often made of bamboo, to reach windows on higher floors. At least one of them used a pea-shooter!In , the knocker-up would be paid a few pence a week. The knocker-up would not leave a clients window until they were sure that the client had been awoken.A knocker upper would also use a snuffer outer as a tool to rouse the sleeping. This implement was used to put out gas lamps which were lit at dusk and then needed to be extinguished at dawn.There were large numbers of people carrying out the job, especially in larger industrial towns. Generally the job was done by elderly men and women but sometimes police constables supplemented their pay by performing the task during early morning patrols.The pictures, re-discovered by areporter on a research task at the Local Studies Department of Ballymena Library appeared in the Belfast Newsletter in January of .

At only four-days-old Dáithí travelled to London where he underwent open heart surgery. Six days after that he underwent his second open heart operation.Máirtín described the stay as a “hard week” for his family and told the Andersonstown News that although Dáithí’s hearthasn’t declined, there had been slight damage done to his kidneys due to the high dosage of medicine the Ballymurphy toddler has to take.“It was a hard week for Dáithí, it was a hard week for us as well,” explained Máirtín. “There were constant needles, test after test for Dáithí but we got through it. The staff were amazing and the cardiologist seemed happy with Dáithí’s heartbut noticed some kidney damage.“Dáithí takes medicine for his heart, to help him go to the toilet he takes aspirin, around  doses of medicine in total a week. The hospital will be keeping an eye on it. Dáithi’s heartis okay at the minute and he is stable.“I know I speak for Seph and I when I say it was tough for us. When we first went over last year we have been educating ourselves ever since around organ donation and it’s got a lot more real. We were speaking to the surgeon who is going to be taking Dáithi’s heart out and eventually putting in a new one hopefully, it’s a lot more real,” he saidSince the family’s ‘Is Deontóír Mé Yes I Donate’ campaign began back in July, launched by Lord Mayor Deirdre Hargey, there has been an increase of four per cent in the number ofpeople in the north who have opted into the organ donation register.Máirtín stressed how transplant is not a cure, but a last resort when all other options have been exhausted.“Seph and I came back from Newcastle saying we had to up the campaign, we have to keep raising awareness. When we were over we had to sign consent forms for the heart surgery for when Dáithí receives his gt, for the surgery to go ahead. You are basically siging a consent form with a list of risks and the first thing that it states is ‘death’ in capital letters and that’s jumping out of the page.“I did a radio interview this week and we were asked ‘so you are basically waiting for someone to die’ so that Dáithí can receive his gt – I said my son is dying, that’s the reality of it. We are desperate to help save his le and truly believe that awareness is key.”“Dáithí had his tube out for three months there and people thought he was fixed because he looks so well, people don’t always think he is sick.”An avid Paw Patrol and Liverpool FC fan, Máirtín and Seph spoke of how their son will continue to wait on the routine list. “He is stable enough to be at home,” explained Seph. “We asked the medical team over in Newcastle what are his chances of getting a heart on the routine list and there was little to none. It’s not impossible but it doesn’t happen that often. There are quite a few children around Dáithí’s weight and age that are unfortunately on the urgent list. We want to be at this stage because it means we are getting more time.”“You don’t want him to get worse but he is going to get worse,” added Máirtín. “While organ donation as a whole is up, hearts for children are down the last two years and that list is going up. As I said transplant is not a cure, transplant give you time. Everybody is dferent the first transplant baby in the UK is now in her ’s. The anxiety that Seph and I have will probably never go away. The last two years have been some of the best and worst times of our lives. We love Dáithí so much and will do anything to get as much time with him as possible.“We have put down hurdles, the first was getting to Newcastle, the second was getting Dáithí assessed, the third was getting him accepted onto the organ list and the next one is getting him a new heart. There will be lots after that but we’ve been taken it one wee step at a time. We would rather be on that rocky road than no road at all,” he said.A family health morning will take place on Saturday February  from -pm as part of Heart Awarnesss month at Glór na Móna.To register to become an organ donor visit: www.organdonation.nhs.uk register-to-donate register-your-details "},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"catherine mcevoy to be named musician of the year","story":"FOR anyone who is familiar with Catherine McEvoy’s music it will come as no surprise to learn that she is to receive the Musician of the Year accolade at the upcoming TG Gradam Ceoil  in Belfast’s Waterfront Hall. As one of the leading concert flautists in Irish traditional music, recording success, TV and radio appearances and a considerable teaching contribution has marked her distinguished career. While Catherine is no stranger to critical acclaim, she says that she was “completely shocked” by the announcement of the award, which comes at a time in her le when she least expected it.Over the last  years Catherine has balanced her own music career alongside a teaching career at St Joseph’s School for Children with Visual Impairment and ChildVision in Dublin. By providing lessons and music therapies to students with multiple disabilities and visual impairment, she gives children a  for their talents and helps equip them with skills to improve their quality of le. The positive impact of Catherine’s work is undeniable but, admittedly, it allows her little time for her own music. Despite being a professional Catherine says she deals with her hectic schedule by treating her own music as a hobby.“I wouldn’t have loads of time for my own music, but I was never a full-time musician,” she explains.“Music was always a hobby for me. I would do some teaching at home, and I would do the Willie Clancy Summer School, and I would do some stuff in the States too. The funny thing about the trips away is that they’re almost like a holiday. “When you’re a professional musician you are under a certain amount of pressure all the time, but I’m lucky in the sense that I’m not because I still play my music in the way I want to play it – it’s something that I’ve always done and I love doing it. It’s still a hobby for me even though it takes up most of my le. I’d love to do a lot more playing for myself than I am, but sometimes work can get in the way.”In her family le, Catherine is also surrounded by music. Her husband Tom also plays the flute, while her three grown-up children, Jane, Ruairi and Fergus are accomplished musicians in their own right, but surprisingly, having grown up in Birmingham, Catherine says she herself hadn’t heard Irish traditional music until she was -years-old. However, it was in those musically formative years in the city that followed that she picked up the distinctive traditional music style of her parents’ native Roscommon, which she would become renowned for in the years to come.“My dad was more into football and my mum was a good ballad singer, she would’ve sang at parties and that,” she says.“I remember listening to Elvis and Clf Richards – we had those sort of records in the house when we were very very young, but not particularly traditional music. “It was only later when I was around eleven that I heard traditional music. I thought ‘oh, I like it’. Then my brother was away in boarding school learning classical fiddle and then he got into The Dubliners and started buying their records. That’s when the whole thing took off. “There was a prolic music scene in Birmingham, as there was in London, but it doesn’t get such a high profile. A lot of the big musicians gravitated towards London, but there was still a lot of great musicians in Birmingham, many of them from Roscommon, and there was lot of great musicians passing through. “Funnily enough I heard an interview with Finbar Furey recently where he was talking about playing in folk club in Birmingham run by a man called Mick Hipkiss – the Skillet Pop Club, and we actually used to play there. I remember seeing Finbar play there, and Christy Moore. I also remember the night when Mick Hipkiss announced this new group that had just been formed and were getting on the road called Planxty – that was back in the early s.”She continued: “A lot of County Roscommon players would travel to Birmingham. One of the first lady flute players I saw play was a woman called Peggy McGrath from County Roscommon and I was really taken with her style – that really spurred me on as well.“The Roscommon style, or the Sligo-Roscommon style, is a rhythmical, flowing sort of style as opposed to what they would call the Northern style,” she explains.“It’s slightly smoother and quite up-tempo. It’s something that I inherited. I wasn’t that I consciously decided to play in that style, it’s just because that was the flute playing that I heard. I’m self-taught and what you hear is what you learn.”Although Catherine says she inherited the Sligo-Roscommon style, she has made it her own indelible skill and fluency. Her recognition as the TG Gradam Ceoil  Musician of the Year undoubtedly encompasses a le-time of achievement, but having picked up a serious injury in her hand just over two years ago, she says it comes following a particularly low part of her career. While her musical ability has suffered as result of her injury, in some ways, the award could not have come at a better time.“Two years ago I had aspontaneous rupture in my right hand in part of my tendon, so I’m very lucky that I can still play,” Catherine says.“It took a lot to get over that I initially thought I wouldn’t be able to play again. I’ve actually had to change my hold on the flute slightly. Obviously the older you get the harder it is to recover, but it has taken a lot of mental anguish to get back to level of playing that I would be happy with. I’m probably only back to about  per cent – I’ll never be  per cent, which is sad in away because I had this idea of retiring and going off into the sunset playing for the rest of my le. I had just gotten over it, and then they go and give me a Gradam Ceoil.”She continued: “It was the biggest shock I ever got in my le. It was massive boost, especially coming from a very low part of my le two or three years ago and sort of clawing my way back. “There are probably loads of other people out there who deserve it, but it’s a great thing and I’m really honoured. I’m delighted and to get an award for something that you’ve been doing for most of your le, something that you get pleasure out of doing, is a great bonus.”She adds: “It’ll be wonderful. It does come with a certain amount of pressure because it’s live TV. I’m the type of person who doesn’t really know how to handle the limelight, but I suppose a lot of Irish people are like that. But it is great, and I’ve had so much good will, which sometimes you don’t realise because you live in a bubble where you think people aren’t thinking about you and then you are showered with all of this good will. That’s nice, and the traditional music community are great.” Gradam recipients, who represent the crème de la crème of traditional music and song, will be joined in live performances on stage by their own special musical guests, including Irish fiddler Paddy Glackin, Michael McCague and multi-instrumentalist Sinéad Egan, to name but a few. A range of VIP guest presenters will also take to the stage last year, actor Stephen Rea and President Michael D. Higgins were amongst the VIP guests at the event.Tickets for the February th TG Gradam Ceoil Awards , priced from £., are available from www.waterfront or +  ."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/bmg-advert-banner-classified-v01.png","title":"ulster u21 club football tournament","story":"Carryduff -St Brigid#s -From David Mohan in CregganDANIEL Guinness was the toast of Carryduff on Sunday as his late point sent his side through to the final of the Ulster U Club Football Tournament at Creggan at the expense of South Belfast neighbours St Brigid#s.This unique local derby between the champions of Antrim and Down lived up to the pre-match hype as the teams served up a thrilling game with some fine scores and plenty of drama with the result in doubt right up until the last kick of the ball when Rory Brolly#s late effort from distance sailed wide as he tried to find an equaliser for the Malone club.In the end, Carryduff probably just about deserved their win as they were a little better in front of the posts with Ronan Beatty notching six points and having a hand in others to take the man-of-the-match award, while Owen McCabe was also in top form for the Down side.St Brigid#s had big games from Patrick Finnegan and Peter Webb, but they just found their scores a little harder to come by, although they certainly couldn#t be faulted for effort as they stuck to the task and almost forced extra-time at the end.Carryduff were first on the board from a Rory Anderson free after three minutes, but St Brigid#s enjoyed a fine spell with Webb kicking a magnicent score in response off his left boot, while Peter Henvey, Rory Brolly and James Smith added points in quick succession to move the Antrim champions three clear after just eight minutes.They would have to wait another  minutes to add to their tally as Carryduff settled into the game and they were on terms soon after when Josh Connery sold a couple of dummies to make a little space and he drilled a fantastic low shot into the net.John McGough followed with a pointed  and Carryduff almost had a second goal straight away, but Pearse Laverty#s shot flashed across the face of goal and wide.Ronan Beatty opened his account from a free on  minutes to make it - to -, while St Brigid#s ended a barren spell with Webb kicking another beauty.The teams went score-for-score for the remainder of the half with Beatty and Connery to the fore for Carryduff, while Webb and Smith raised flags for St Brigid#s as the Down side went in at the break leading - to -.A Laverty free two minutes after the restart extended the gap to three for Carryduff two minutes after the break, but St Brigid#s were level on  minutes when Patrick Finnegan was trailed back inside the area as he was about to pull the trigger and a penalty was awarded. Up stepped Peter Henvey and his shot was well-struck high into the net to tie the game at -.Carryduff made the perfect response as from the restart, they moved straight upfield with Beatty getting on the ball, finding Ciaran Sherry who broke through and squared for Darragh Connolly who rose to palm into the net and restore his side#s three-point lead.Beatty and Owen McCabe added points as it appeared Carryduff were set to pull away, but St Brigid#s refused to break as John Blaney and Rory Brolly kicked scores to get them back to within three.Beatty and Finnegan traded points while Beatty added another from play to make it a four-point game with seven to play, but St Brigid#s were far from done.Five minutes from time, substitute Paul Bradley gathered Peter King#s long ball and waited for movement inside. He spotted James Smith in space and played a high ball that Smith rose to meet and brilliantly palm to the corner of the net.Again, Carryduff went upfield and found the net when Beatty put Connolly in on the right, but while his shot was destined for the net, substitute Eoin Rooney decided to make sure of it by getting his foot to it. However, Rooney was well inside the small square before the ball and the effort was correctly ruled out for a square ball.St Brigid#s took full advantage as they swept upfield and Smith thumped over a great point to level with three to play.Once more, Carryduff were able to respond. This time, Guinness created space  meters out and his shot curled just inside the post with the referee # standing right behind the shot # overruling the umpire who waved it wide.St Brigid#s still had time to save themselves, but they couldn#t engineer a score as Carryduff broke away and almost sealed their win, but Rooney#s shot crashed off the crossbar to give the Antrim champions one last chance. But with the whistle in referee Martin Conroy#s mouth, it was now or never and Brolly had to shoot from an unfavourable distance, the effort tailing right and wide as Carryduff held on.CARRYDUFF: D Ross L Toal, G Henderson, C Cunningham J McGeough , D Coogan, D GuinnessP Laverty , J ConneryR Anderson , O McCabe , P Loughran D Connolly , R Beatty , C Sherry.

The Prime Ministers official spokesman told reporters in Westminster: \"The conditions for a border poll are set out in the Belfast Agreement. It remains the Northern Ireland Secretarys view that the majority of the people of Northern Ireland continue to support the current political settlement and that the circumstances requiring a border poll are not satisfied.\"Ms McDonald said Theresa May did not commit to saying in what circumstances an Irish unity poll might be called. The  Belfast Agreement states that the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland may call such a referendumat any time it appears likely that the majority of voters in Northern Ireland would wish to leave the United Kingdom and enter into a united Ireland. The exchange between the Prime Minister and Sinn Fein leader came during a series of meetings with political parties at Stormont House in Belfast. Ms McDonald said that a majority here voted for the United Kingdom to remain in the European Union, and that by the region being taken out of the EU with the rest of the UK, the principle of consent - a key principle of the Belfast Agreement - has been damaged. \"Nobody in Ireland has consented to Brexit, the people of the north of Ireland voted to remain,\" she said. \"The Good Friday Agreement, the central premise of it as regards to constitutional arrangements, is the concept of consent. We believe that in attempting to coerce the north of Ireland out of the European Union against the democratically expressed wishes of the people, that the concept of consent has been damaged. \"We also know from polling data north and south that public sentiment is of a view that in the event of a crash Brexit, that peoples preference would be for Irish unity. \"The only way that anyone can act in a democratic fashion is to respect consent, to respect the democratic wishes of the people of the north of Ireland and to use the Good Friday Agreement, its provisions, to guide us in the time ahead. \"Sothere is a Tory crash, and Mrs May has conceded as much on the floor of the House of Commons, in that event, not alone will there be pressure for a referendum on Irish unity, there will be absolute democratic imperative to call such a referendum.\"When pressed over how Mrs May had responded to this during their meeting, Ms McDonald said that neither the Prime Minister or Secretary of State Karen Bradley committed to saying when oran Irish unity poll would be called. She said: \"But that is the secondary consideration, the primary issue here is the concept of consent which is hardwired into the Good Friday Agreement, the fact that the people of the north of Ireland have not consented to Brexit, the fact that business, farmers, academia, community sector, trade unions and political system almost unanimously regard Brexit as damaging and negative, almost unanimously regard the backstop as the absolutely bare minimum and the bottom line. \"The exception to that consensus is the DUP. The DUP cannot rule the roost on these matters, actually the people need to be in the driving seat, just as they voted against Brexit. In the event of a crash, I think the democratically correct thing to do, the compliant thing to do as regards the Good Friday Agreement, is toto the people again, and in a structured way, to allow for the debate for the conversation for the transition and to put the question on Irish unity. \"Mrs May is a unionist, she takes a dferent view.\""},{"url":null,"title":"unionists vote down bid to celebrate pride 2019 with town","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

However, unionist councillors voted down the motion, which would also have resulted in a council presence at the annual Belfast Pride Parade in August. Members of the DUP and Ulster Unionists rejected the plan and said they would not be taking lectures on equality from Sinn Fein. Last August, Sinn Fein spearheaded an attempt to fly rainbow flags on the councils premises to show support to LGBTQ+ citizens during Pride.Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon was set to make history by becoming the first council in Northern Ireland to fly the Pride flag above its three civic buildings.But the DUP invoked the call-in mechanism, which allows decisions to be reconsideredat least % of councillors request it.The DUP said strict procedures on flying flags and emblems hadnt been followed properly.The council then sought legal advice, which both the DUP and Sinn Fein claimed justied their stance. The row meant Pride Day last August passed without the flags in place. People taking part in the Belfast Pride parade set off from Custom House Square in central Belfast. Michael Cooper PA WireSinn Fein council group leader Darren McNally told the Ulster Gazette newspaper it was disappointing but not surprising that both unionist parties had voted against lighting up the civic buildings. He said: \"We have a erse community and the onus is on us to ensure we not only represent minority groups such as our LGBT community but that we make them feel valued, included, welcome and safe. \"Lighting up the civic buildings on Pride Day and an official presence at the parade is a forward-moving gesture - small but signicant - which would send out a clear message that ABC council are here for our LGBT community at a time when they are subject to hate attacks and left feeling isolated. \"In amending our original motion of the flying of the Pride flag, we were recognising that some parties are on a journey with regards to this particular issue. Other unionist councillors have supported similar motions in other councils.\"However, UUP councillor Jim Speers hit out at what he called the \"mischievous\" motion. He said: \"Sinn Feins actions go counter to the good working relationships we need at ABC Council. \"They are the last party that should be giving lectures on the need for equality. For a party which was linked to an organisation which terrorised this community for over  years to be talking about equality is disgusting.\"The DUPs Gareth Wilson accused Sinn Fein of \"blatant electioneering\". He added: \"Given the ious and well publicised anti-DUP messages associated with the event in question, our party grouping decided unanimously to decline support for this latest Sinn Fein motion.\" "},{"url":null,"title":"brusselsbound pm may is left in no doubt over bitter brexit divisions","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

to landfill by %.Mr Hannaway said the council was also delighted to open the new poundm Down Leisure Centre which he described as a ldquosignature project that will make a real contribution to improving citizensrsquo health and wellbeing.ldquoWe are even more ambitious for the coming year, with the agreement on funding for the Belfast Region City Deal, we have plans for a new conference and theatre facility in Newry City, the delivery of the Southern Relief Road and a -year programme of economic growth, the chief executive continued.ldquoThe reopening of the Warrenpoint Municipal Park in August and the opening of the Carlingford Lough Greenway from Newry to Victoria Lock in July demonstrate our councilrsquos commitment to improving our arearsquos attractions and environment.Mr Hannaway said that in the coming year Newry and its Cathedral Corridor would see pound, for improvements, festive lighting and events, to building on what has already been achieved in these locations.His focus also turned to Brexit, explaining that as the March  deadline for leaving edges ever closer, the councilrsquos relationships with government departments, the EU, cross border bodies and institutions across Ireland and Britain will become even more important as it seeks to improve the district.ldquoThese partnerships will remain a priority for the coming year as we deliver initiatives, programmes and services for all the people living, working and investing in our district, he continued.ldquoSome of the projects that will be progressed during the   year include further revitalisation of Warrenpoint, with pound, for town improvements, including shop fronts, new signage and a promotional and marketing campaign.ldquoThe council has also secured approval for the Ballynahinch bypass, a plan that will greatly improve access throughout the area and relieve the traffic congestion in the town centre.Mr Hannaway said plans for the southern relief road in Newry will be progressed after the preferred route was announced and was confident that developing a strategic link road between the A Dublin Road and the A Warrenpoint Road mdash a project that the council is working on with Stormont officials ndash will contribute to increasing the economy of the whole region.He said improving public services and the way they were implemented was another important goal for the council in the new financial year, revealing that five ambitious performance improvement objectives had been identied.They include encouraging healthy lestyles, improving economic growth and promoting the district as a premier tourist destination, delivering urban and rural regeneration initiatives, creating a cleaner, greener district, and encouraging and empowering local communities to work with the Council to deliver on its programmes.ldquoOver the coming months, the council will be working with local groups to ensure that their views on how best to implement these important goals, he confirmed.ldquoOver the coming year, the historic town of Downpatrick will benefit from a new public realm improvement scheme as part of the Masterplan which will be delivered in partnership with the Department for Communities and the Department for Infrastructure.Mr Hannaway said the district continued to benefit from EU funding, with pound.m being provided to South East Area Fisheries Local Action Group which promotes economic growth and job creation in coastal and inland communities.Under the PEACE IV programme pound.m had been allocated to the council to deliver the Local Authority Action PlanmdashBeyond Tolerance in the three key areas of children and young people, shared spaces and services, and building positive relationships.Projects funded under this initiative include an

the table to nine points when they condemned Killough to the also rans category at The Links, Strangford on Saturday.Killough, who have been forced go play their home games anywhere they can as the Mill Field undergoes further repairs, could easily have collected three points with a resolute second half display, but Ballynagross closed up shop after taking - lead at the end of the first half.Both sides settled quickly with the excellent playing surface encouraging players to keep the ball on the floor. It was Ballynagross, who didnrsquot seem to miss the suspended Matthew Rooney and Declan Dowie too much, that drew first blood in the fth minute.The dashing Eoin Rooney, who was making his first team debut following a recent move from Downpatrick FC, took full advantage of a failed offside call from Killough, sped past Stevie Laverty and beat new lsquokeeper Peter Kelly with a clinical finish.Killough retaliated immediately with Michael Burns, Gareth George and Tony McIhone prodding patiently from the middle of the park and when an opening came, Declan Looney, a team-mate of Eoin Rooney at Downpatrick not that long ago, put the burners on and rled a sweet equaliser past Conor McCullough, a former Killough lsquokeeper, from just inside the box.As expected from a derby clash, no quarter was asked or given and it took a few yellow cards to bring the combatants under control before Daniel Taggart popped up in the box to restore the visitorsrsquo lead with a poacherrsquos finish.Killough tried to get back on level terms with Freddie OrsquoConnor raiding down the flank and Ross Armstrong working overtime in a bid to create something of note. However, a Ballynagross back four of Conor Marron, John Shields, Aaron Beattie and Gary Carberry were in dominant form and they steadfastly refused to give way.Karl Gelstonrsquos side was more than happy to hit Killough on the break and midway through the first half, assassin Donal McCavera gave them a - lead as Killough were caught chasing the game.Killough had to throw caution to the wind and pulled a goal back just before the break when the dangerous McIlhoneexploded into le when he drilled in a beauty to give his side every chance of getting a result.The second half, although as equally as combative, never reached the dizzy heights of the first  minutes with two well-matched sides cancelling each other out in a midfield war of attrition.Chances were few and far between with the respective defences on top. Killough again did the chasing, but there was just no way past Carberry and Beattie and lsquokeeper McCullough did all that was asked of him.The longer the game went on, the deeper Ballynagross defended, but in the final analysis, Killough just didnrsquot have the necessary firepower to break them down.Killough: Peter Kelly, Colm Kearney, Stevie Laverty, Jason Clarke, Kevin Groves, Tony McIlhone, Michael Burns, Freddie OrsquoConnor, Declan Looney, Ross Armstrong, Gareth George.

It literally became a tidal wave of women going, lsquoYes Me Too, Yes Me Too, Yes Me Toorsquo.ldquoSexual assault is everywhere.It has been normalised. It has been accepted.

He has a proud direct lineage to the band when it first started out  years ago. His great-uncle, James Strain of Woodgrange, was the bandrsquos first pipe major.He also has pipes dating back to the early days of the band, a much-prized piece of heritage along with the framed photographs of former pipe band members and lodge members which line the walls of the Orange Hall.James Strain was taught by the bandrsquos first piping instructor, William Maxwell from Newcastle, who used to travel by train to Tullymurry on the Ballydugan Road and then arrive by bicycle or horse and cart to the hall.Sammy, who joined the band when he was seven, says, as do other members, that his introduction into the pipe band world was a natural extension of his family le.ldquoIt was actually my cousin who taught me the pipes even though my father Sam was pipe major at the time, he said.ldquoI joined in  and played my first Twelfth in Newcastle in  when I was nine. At that time I was playing whatrsquos called a three-quarter set of pipes.ldquoI canrsquot remember being askedI wanted to join but as my great-grandfather was one of the first members, it was just in the family. It was just handed down, it was taken for granted, more or less, that you were going to learn the pipes.ldquoWhen we started out, there really was nothing  so the band was number one. Itrsquos dficult now to keep a band going with so many other things for the young ones to be doing, so how we managed to keep a band going  years, I do not know.From head to toe, it can cost from between pound to pound, to kit out an adult pipe band member in full unorm and around pound for child members.The unorm has always represented a major investment mdash in addition to practice and competition timemdash for any member.In his history of the band on its th anniversary, Sammy recounted the lower end of a quotation given for a new unorm in  coming in at  pounds  shillings, which is equivalent to around pound today.The retired farmer has been with the band during the worst and the best of times.ldquoWe went through a lean period in the late Eighties and we werenrsquot contesting then. We started contesting in  and then again about five or six years ago, he said.ldquoThe best time of the band I can recall was in  when I retired as pipe major. My cousin, Francey Strain, took the band over and as we had a lot of young ones then, those were the best years up until  where we went to the World Pipe Band Championships in Cowal and we were upgraded three times in that time.The best of times for Hollymount was when they came runners-up in their grade B at the World Championships on their first entry into the competition.Ronnie Steele recalls: ldquoWe were very nearly not going but decided at the last minute so it was a real rush to try and book the boat and to find somewhere for us all to stay.Hollymount achieved their biggest achievement to date on one of the blackest days in Northern Ireland history mdash the day of the Omagh bombing on August ,.While the band continued throughout the  years of the Troubles, it emerged unscathed, according to Ronnie, who adds: ldquoThrough all the Troubles we had never any bother down here we never missed anything out.Another strong family connection belongs to pipe major Sam Gill ndash whose maternal uncle is Sammy Strain. His two sons, Jackand seven year-old Charlie, are in the band. When the  year-old isnrsquot at the band or at work as a mechanic, he continues to perfect his skill as a former world ploughing champion and the winner of the NI title for  years.ldquoMy father, Raymond, played in the band as did my twin brother, David, who now plays for Drumlough Pipe Band.ldquoWhen I joined at the age of eight, it was just a matter in those days that after my father came home from work and got a bit of dinner, he would have say, rsquoRight, I take you up to the bandrsquo.ldquoSammy Strain taught me the notes on a blackboard whereas now you have the likes of Ronniersquos daughter, Christie, who records me on her phone playing and she practice.Ronnie shares his love of the band with daughters Christie , Ashleyand three year-old Megan. No doubt his youngest, one year-old Alexandra, will be drafted in a few years time.Piper Ryan Green, who used to play for the former Seaforde and Woodgrange Pipe Bands, has also introduced his  year-old son, Matthew, while piper Robert Neill plays alongside his  year-old daughter Laura.Sometimes the pull towards piping and Hollymount misses a generation. However, the family influence remains strong as in the case of siblings Jessica and Thomas Watson, whose great grandfather, David Stranney, was in the band, although their parents werenrsquot.But the members know that keeping the band going for the next generation is an even greater challenge today than it was  years ago.They are delighted that it currently has  members aged  and under in the band.Apart from marching in the annual Twelfth celebrations, the main activity for the band is performing at local concerts where it has raised more than pound, in recent years for charities.Sam Gill says that the next big push, once some of the younger members are ready for it, will be to start competing in contests again, although they know it may take some time to reach their former B grade.ldquoTherersquos still a hunger to try and get the band to be as good as possible.

Within a week of its multi-million pound replacement opening for business, membership numbers doubled.The stunning new three-storey facility boasts a range of facilities which would rival any of those more commonly found in leisure complexes attached to five star hotels.Boasting ultra-modern equipment, the magnicent and futuristic , square metre centre heralds an exciting new dawn in the history of leisure provision across the district with facilities including an  station wellness gymnasium featuring the latest equipment.There is also a -station spin studio, -metre six-lane swimming pool, luxury vitality health suite including a sauna, steam room and vitality pool.

We have more quality control on our beef and that is what makes it high grade. This leaves us in a very dficult position because we cannot produce our beef for any less than we already do.ldquoOur fear is that, in the event of a lsquono dealrsquo and there isnrsquot enough UK beef to satisfy demand, they will look at bringing in beef from outside of the UK. If itrsquos brought in at a cheaper price it could very well leave us in a tight spot.Mr Rice, whose family has been in farming for generations, continued: ldquoBeef and lamb have been subsidised by the EU indirectly in the form of Single Farm Payments. Dairy, pork and chicken are already at world prices and can already compete. They will not see such a big fluctuation whereas we will be more exposed.ldquoIf Prime Minister Teresa May were to step in and take over the subsidies, the outlook looks favourable in the short term.ldquoBut when a boat load of beef comes in from Brazil then almost certainly subsidies will be reduced and wersquoll be paid to maintain the landscape. In other words wersquoll be reduced to gardeners.Describing Brexit as the ldquobiggest peacetime emergency in almost a century, Ballynahinch farmer Barry Higgins said the uncertainty of the situation did not do farmers any favours.ldquoWe feel itrsquos more of a back lash than a back stop, he remarked, adding that he hoped no farmers would be forced out of business.Dessie Canavan, from Kilcoo, said farmers were being ldquodragged into Brexit against their will.ldquoIt is unfair for us to compete against the likes of Brazil and Argentina, he remarked. ldquoDepending on the size of our farm, sometimes we are forced out into part-time jobs to subsidise our income. And thatrsquos before Brexit comes into force. There is much to be concerned about.A spokesman for Downpatrick Co Operative Marketing Ltd said its role was to respect the views of all its shareholders and customers, who are farmers.He added: ldquoOur business relies solely on the trading of livestock both locally and outside Northern Ireland and we are therefore concerned about the impact Brexit will have on our daily business and the local faming community we serve.ldquoAs part of a democratic society we respect the peoplersquos vote to leave the EU, but we are also aware the majority of people in Northern Ireland voted to remain.ldquoWe now have a situation with two main options mdash either crash out or negotiate a deal to leave. Our main fear with the crash out option is that it exposes us all to a greater risk of casualties rather than survivors.ldquoOver the past  months Teresa May has been trying tirelessly to negotiate a Brexit deal with the EU that represents and respects all the people within the UK.The spokesman said: ldquoAll we ask is the same respect is given to any deal which identies and supports the uniqueness of trading and faming in Northern Ireland. Businesses and farmers are very good at adapting to change in whatever form it comes but at present, with no clear decision on Brexit, the ongoing development of any business has been affected.The Ulster Farmersrsquo Union is also concerned at the prospect of a lsquono dealrsquo Brexit UFU president Ivor Ferguson added: ldquoWe respect the referendum result and that the UK will leave the EU. However, the uncertainty is very damaging.ldquoWith March  less than  days away decisions need to be taken urgently and a deal agreed. Leaving the EU without a deal would be catastrophic for Northern Irelandrsquos farming families and their businesses.ldquoNo deal means high tarfs on our exports creating an effective trade embargo and the possibility of lower standard imports flooding the UK market.ldquoThese practical issues will have an immediate and profound impact on farmers, causing major disruptions to the supply chain, crippling the industry and rendering our farmers uncompetitive..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C February 6%2C 1979  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH mdash A Ballynahinch headmaster hit out at the education authorities this week for the lack of permanent accommodation at his school where two thirds of the pupils are in wooden huts.Mr Harry Bent said St Colmanrsquos High School had been promised a major extension, but was unlikely to get it ldquoas long as comprehensive education is the policy of the Government.Speaking at the schoolrsquos annual prize day, Mr Bent said it angered him that the provision of accommodation had not kept pace with the growing numbers and successes of pupils.ldquoIn St Colmanrsquos nine temporary classrooms accommodate  pupils out of a total of , he said. ldquoThis means that almost two thirds of our pupils are in temporary accommodation which was first erected as a temporary measure ten years ago.Mr Bent stressed temporary classrooms may solve a financial problem for the Government, but there was so substitute for normal school accommodation.ldquoAt least  of the  subjects on the secondary curriculum are practical subjects, such as domestic science.

The only exception would be when sensitive information is being discussed, he said. ldquoNo reasoning was given as to why the CIL visit should have been in private.Councillor Dermot Curran said the event should have been held in the ldquofull glare of the public and asked why more meetings were now being arranged mdash at the ratepayersrsquo expense mdash when one open to all councillors, the press and the public would have been sufficient.Slieve Croob councillor John Rice also expressed concern that only elected representatives were able to hear from the Commissioners.ldquoThis meeting was about a lighthouse and it was ridiculous that the public, in particular those campaigning to retain the beam, were not permitted to listen to the debate, he added.Cllr Cadogan Enright, whose proposal that reporters and the public should have been admitted was defeated, believes there was no reason to exclude them. He claimed the attitude of ldquohiding what was going on in council was becoming too common and needed to be stopped.ldquoTransparency in council is the best way to win public trust, he declared. ldquoThe Commissioners said they are not proposing to take away the existing apparatus except for the mercury bath. They propose putting a new rotating LED beam on the top of the lighthouse to demonstrate that they were listening to local people and plan to bring this all to consultation later in the year.Cllr Enright said the Commissioners confirmed that Newry, Mourne and Down Council could bring forward a partnership with a local preservation group in a manner similar to what happened at Loop Head lighthouse in Co Clare.A council spokesman said: ldquoThis workshop was a preliminary information session for councillors and prior to any plans being finalised or put in place for St Johnrsquos Point lighthouse, a wide ranging public consultation is planned, he said.The spokesman added: ldquoCouncillors present also agreed to invite officers from the Commissioner of Irish Lights to a joint DEA Forum meeting to ensure information can be shared and that local stakeholders and communities are fully consulted upon any proposals for the lighthouse in the immediate future..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Magical Mooney conjures up late%2C late winner  ","story":"DOWN were forced to rely on an eleventh hour intervention from Caolan Mooney to get over the line at Connolly Park, Sligo, on Sunday.The Rostrevor governor swooped in added time to turn a - to - deficit into a winning scenario with a sensational last-gasp goal to give Paddy Tallyrsquos charges their first win of the campaign.It all looked so bleak for the visitors for most of the game as Sligo dominated the exchanges, but Down hung on grimly and Mooney saved the day four minutes into added time.Sligo started in a hurry and points from Pat Hughes and Liam Gaughan gave the hosts a - to - lead after five minutes.Hughes slammed in a quick goal to increase Sligorsquos lead to five points before Paul Devlin registered Downrsquos first score with a converted free in the eighth minute.Further unanswered points from Pat Havern and Ryan and Jerome Johnston brought Down to within a point of the home side midway through the first half.

It is also hoped to provide a storage and work area and space for the community to use.Cllr Curran said many people were eager to read the conclusions of the government departmentrsquos review, particularly in the context of a post-Brexit scenario.He added: ldquoAt this point in time all those within the fishing sector in particular are looking at the ongoing discussions around Brexit and wondering what any final decision will have on an already heavily regulated industry.Meanwhile, Ardglass Golf Club is the venue for a special event next Wednesday, February , when funding opportunities under the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund support programme will be outlined during an information session which runs between am and .pm.The funding initiative is designed to support a broad range of projects that focus on promoting economic growth through job creation and social inclusion in coastal and inland communities which depend on fishing and aquaculture.This includes the ersication of activities within fisheries and into other sectors of the maritime economy with the pound.m funding cake being administered by the South East Area Fisheries Local Action Group which comprises representatives from the public, private and voluntary sectors within the Newry, Mourne and Down and Ards and North Down council areas.The projects eligible for financial support must must demonstrate how they will impact on fishing dependent communities..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Spa’s James and Kirsty dance to success  ","story":"YOUNG farmers from all over Co Down descended upon a Belfast hotel recently for this yearrsquos star-studded grand final of Strictly Young Farmers.More usually associated with Simmentals and Shorthorns the Strictly contestants showed they were equally at home with a good salsa or a samba on stage at the Crown Plaza Hotel in a bid to win the much revered glitter ball.The event sponsored by Barclays, saw Young Farmersrsquo clubs from all over Co Down welcome a crowd of over , made up of sponsors, family and friends, to support this yearrsquos dancers.The enthusiastic audience were dazzled with a vast array of steps and styles including the cha cha cha, jive, charleston, paso doble and American smooth.In preparation for the big night the committed couples underwent a strict regime every Monday evening since last November.Following much swinging, sweat and a lot of fake tan the couples were well able to showcase their talent at the annual event to raise funds for Alzheimerrsquos Society and local Young Farmersrsquo clubs.The event was hosted by past YFCU president Roberta Simmons, of Rathfriland YFC, past YFCU vice-president Harry Crosby, of Spa YFC, and current YFCU vice-president Andrew Patton, from Newtownards YFC.Assisting with the eveningrsquos entertainment were judges Karen Patterson from the BBC and past Young Farmer, James Trotman, Agri Manager for Barclays, Janet Plunkett, Fundraising Manager for Alzheimerrsquos Society in Northern Ireland, and Zita McNaugher, current YFCU deputy president.Competing couples George Porter and Laura Sproule, Matthew Ney and Rebecca Nelson, Chris Reid and Sarah Robinson, Harry Walker and Emma Connolly, James Gilpin and Emma McAnea, Ward Patterson and Sarah Reid, Richard Kennedy and Jessica Lee, Harry Hamilton and Louise McAnea, Graham Annett and Sarah Graham wowed the crowd with their twinkle toes.However, it was James McCauley and Kirsty Burrows, from Spa YFC, who danced their way to the top with their energetic charleston to be crowned Strictly winners .The organising committee, led by Co Down YFC chairperson Linzi Stewart and secretary Kristina McKeag, thanked everyone who helped make the night such a success, particularly sponsors, hosts, judges, family and friends and last but not least the dancers, who were the stars of the show..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/farming/resources/images/4368582.jpg","title":"outstanding quality at second calf fair","story":"Breed judges from throughout the UK and Ireland were unanimous in their praise for the Pedigree Calf Fair and Beef NI Expo, held at the Balmoral Showgrounds in Belfast on SaturdaySpeaking after the one-day show, which featured three show rings and  native and continental beef breeds, event organiser and Chairman, David Connolly said: ldquoItrsquos been another fantastic event, and we certainly exceeded our strap-line lsquoBigger and Betterrsquo.ldquoThe  show has surpassed last yearrsquos inaugural event, attracting hundreds of spectators and more than  trade exhibits.

However, the Irish government, facing a growing revolt on the matter from TDs, says the bill would breach EU law and is opposing it. The Control of Economic ActivityBill  does not specically mention Israel but would make it an offence for a person to “import or sell goods or services originating in an occupied territory or to extract resources from an occupied territory in certain circumstances”.The bill passed through the Upper House of the Irish Parliament, the Seanad, by - and - in two votes in November. Last month, a further vote in the lower house, the Dail, saw it supported - with three abstentions. It has a further three stages to go in the Dail after which it would have to be signed by the Irish president to become law. Some observers suggest it is unlikely he would, due to government opposition.DUP MLA William Humphrey said: “It seems bizarre that the European enthusiasts in the Dail would try to pass a bill boycotting Israeli goods when such a move is not compatible with EU trade law.“Israeli technology and goods are embedded completely in our everyday lives and those proposing boycotts ignore the practical and economic realities of such a move. “If the Republic of Ireland wants to turn its back on the opportunities of working with Israel I would extend an invitation to the Israeli legislators to come to Northern Ireland. I know many businesses would welcome the opportunity such a visit would bring.”In a speech to TDs on January , Irish Deputy Prime Minister Simon Coveney said the bill would place the Republic in breach of EU trade law.“Trade is an exclusive competence of the European Union,” he said. “We are not in a position to raise a barrier and declare that it is prohibited to bring to Ireland, for sale or personal use, goods which enter the EU legally, and are freely circulating where in the single market.”The bill will not signicantly impact on Israeli settlements, he said. However, it could lead the Republic into legal challenges, signicant EU penalties and paying damages to those with economic interests in the Israeli settlements.Brexit: DUP will vote against any backstop, says Sammy WilsonPolice called to deal with agitated male carrying alleged offensive weapon Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Such legislation would also undermine the Republic’s credibility to influence Middle East issues at EU and UN level, he said.And it could create conflicts for US companies in the Republic and Irish companies in the US, he said, because the US Congress has been considering legislation which forbids companies based in America from cooperating with Israeli trade bans. “For these reasons, no responsible party of government could support this bill and this government must and will oppose it,” Mr Coveney said.Opposing the bill in the Jerusalem Post, Irish Jew and former Irish minister for justice and defence, Alan Shatter, said none of the proponents of the bill in the Irish Parliament had mentioned ongoing terrorist attacks on Israeli civilians or the support by Hamas and Hezbollah for Iran’s “genocidal objective of destroying the Israeli state”.Although not much emphasized, he said, it is also clear from the bill’s terminology that it applies to any goods or services originating from any Israeli presence in east Jerusalem and on the Golan Heights.In addition, he said, Sinn Fein’s enthusiastic support for the bill is “payback for the training given by the PLO in terrorism and bomb making” to the IRA.And slamming Fianna Fail’s support for the bill, he noted that in the s the party “denied residential visas to many German Jews trying to escape Nazi Germany and, postwar, to Holocaust survivors”. He believes that the bill’s passage “may grind to a halt”the government considers it too expensive to implement and designates it as “a money bill”.

I think he’d be wasting quite a lot of someone ’s money.”New Presbyterian moderator calls for ‘common sense’ over Irish language act Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch  TrendingIN PICTURES:  things you should never EVER say or do to someone from Northern IrelandHas PSNI officer Bobby Singleton become an unwitting sex symbol Ian Ogle daughter: UVF gang that murdered Dad are still planning to kill my brotherVIDEO: Police investigation into fight at Belfast International Airport, AldergroveIN PICTURES: the funeral of Ian Ogle          ..

I wanted to do something which would allow me to combine the flexibility of family with work and give me a good balance. I also wanted to develop and use my skill sets.”From her initial idea, Eveva was born – setting her up as a virtual assistant. “I saw a niche in the market for this type of work with small businesses and self- employed people who simply do not have the time to manage the tasks themselves,” she explained.“I offer a range of services, particularly in digital marketing, where I manage email marketing campaigns and social media pages for clients. I joined a few local networking groups, where I have since met my first clients and I am now starting to see referrals come through.” she explains.Eve turned her vision into a reality after taking part in the Go For It Programme, which is delivered free of charge by a team of experienced business mentors through Northern Ireland’s wide network of enterprise agencies. “Often it is hard to know where to start that was my experience before starting the Go For It Programme.

But also we recognise that it has been politicised in many ways, and we think that discussion needs to be depoliticised for the benefit and the good of the whole of our land.“I think we need to be sensitive, particularlygetting an Irish language act was too costly and bureaucratic and we need to measure that against hospital beds and all those aspects. So from that point of view, I think we need a little bit of common sense in the discussion.”He went on to add: “I think we just need to be careful within the breadth of what that encompasses.“Certainly we’ve to value the Irish language in a way that those who do think it’s important [are able to] recognise that and can see that.“But I think there have to be constraints and there has to be a bit of common sense in just how much it actually costs, and that I suppose is the other angle other people come at it from.”Lord Trimble raises £k in two days in legal action over backstopBrexit: DUP will vote against any backstop, says Sammy Wilson Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch  TrendingIN PICTURES:  things you should never EVER say or do to someone from Northern IrelandHas PSNI officer Bobby Singleton become an unwitting sex symbol Ian Ogle daughter: UVF gang that murdered Dad are still planning to kill my brotherVIDEO: Police investigation into fight at Belfast International Airport, AldergroveIN PICTURES: the funeral of Ian Ogle          ..

The site will potentially generate up to  new work positions across management, supervisory, warehousing staff and apprenticeship roles.Speaking of the new facility and what it will bring, Mr Rattenbury said: ldquoWe are delighted that our vision of a lsquoone stop shoprsquo for our customers is being realised and having a  hour, seven day a week co-packing facility in the heart of Wales, is a game changer for our industry. We can now offer our customers a streamlined product supply chain package by integrating their co-packing requirements with the grouprsquos warehouse and transport subsidiary companies.ldquoLogistically, this works out to be more cost effective overall, but also lowers the carbon footprint on the transportation of food products, which is something we are passionate about.Wild Water Group has a current annual turnover of poundm and Mr Rattenbury believes the company can increase that figure by a further poundm within  months and then reach poundm within two to three years.The project is backed by a pound. million investment from Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking and the Development Bank of Wales and has secured Welsh Government funding under the new economic contract.Using a similar business model to the grouprsquos other three sites in Merthyr Tydfil, Llanishen and Cardf Bay, the first phase of development will be the conversion of available space into a large ambient open plan co-packing facility, which will be operational early November  to meet festive season demand.During the first quarter of , Wild Water Group will move the entire Cardf Bay co-packing facility to Aberbargoed, once freezer facilities, production lines and machinery are in place.The company will then continue services such as frozen to frozen storage, bagging, over wrapping, sleeving and tray sealing, as well as the full spectrum of print labelling applications required under the Food Safety Technicalspecications.Economy Secretary Ken Skates said: ldquoThis project will not only see a successful, growing Welsh business create an additional  jobs, it will also create a new strategic hub and facility for both large and small food and drink businesses across the region to pack or store products themselves. This could, in turn, open up new markets for those businesses ndash so Irsquom excited about what this means not only for Wild Water Group and Aberbargoed, but for the region more widely.ldquoIt shows that both our Economic and Food and Drink Action plans are delivering what we had hoped ndash jobs, prosperity and sustainable growth. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

I now intend to present an amended report to cabinet on February .ldquoThe report will propose that option one in the previous report now be taken forward, which retains the current roundabout though enhances the gateway route into Penarth whilst providing much safer crossing opportunities for cyclists and pedestrians. There is no requirement to complete any spending on this project by the end of this financial year.ldquoIt is very dficult to please everyone with highway improvement schemes but I very much hope that this option provides the active travel benefits we are seeking and is viewed by residents and visitors to Penarth as being the most appropriate. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It was made with willow grown in the grounds of Cogan Primary School.More than  people attended the hill rolling ceremony down Clf Hill towards Penarth Esplanade - with the school pupils from Cogan and pupils and families from Ysgol Pen Y Garth helping to roll it along.The head was accompanied by a wooden frame from the Mabinogion stories called the Window of Sorrows made by Tony Simms, and the artist Ifor Davies undertook the ritual sawing of the Window of Sorrows on the clftops and read the Bendigeidfran story from the Mabinogion tales before the rolling went ahead.The head of Bendigeidfran and the Window of Sorrows was accompanied by Penarths Mari Lwyd which is a symbol of hosting, and negotiating hospitality through song and teasing. Richard Parry led the Mari Lwyd this year, and on arriving at the bottom of the hill the celebration visited local shops and resaurants along the sea front wishing the proprietors and customers a Happy New Year. We sang for Romeo Italian restaurant, The Fig Tree, James Sommerin, The Crazy Cafe and Hamptons seaside shop. After reaching the bottom of the hill the head was carried by the children along with the Mari Lwyd to the shops and cafes along the seafront where dferent New Year songs - called Calenig - were sung in each venue and led by local opera singer Richard Parry.Speaking about the event, artist Haf Weighton said: \"I loved working with Cogan School. Itrsquos a hidden gem in Penarth with very enthusiastic staff who were happy to jump in to get involved in this project at short notice. Richard Parry and the schools deputy head Tom Lewis, ran a assembly to the whole school on the new year traditions. Then children from across the school came to see me working on the piece. \"It was lovely to hear children who donrsquot come from homes where Welsh is spoken enthusing about the mabinogi tales and Welsh traditions. Children from Pen y Garth joined in after the head was created. They helped us roll it down the hill from the clf tops.\"Richard Parry, who helped to organise the event and led the Mari Lwyd, said: \"It was great to see so many people come together to celebrate Hen Galan in Penarth. The giant Bendegeidfran got his name because he was the Blessed Bran - the best friend anyone could ever want - and in the stories of the Mabinogion he was loved by those who knew him. He is a symbol of friendship and celebrating together. \"The community celebration on the clftops was thoroughly enjoyed by children and adults alike, and even though its a bit chilly it was wonderful to see so many people out of doors, celebrating, singing and enjoying wishing everyone we met Blwyddyn Newydd Dda and Happy New Year.\"The head will now go on display at a iety of places, including Pen y Garth School, Cogan Primary School, Penarth Library and The Hearth Gallery Llandough Hospital. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We tell client’s stories through engaging content written by former journalists – grab their customers’ attention with stunning design, maximise conversions by using the latest digital marketing expertise, and develop websites which are living, breathing, online stores or shop windows. As content director, my role is to bring almost  years’ experience in journalism, political communications, corporate PR, crisis management and digital content crafting to Grofuse. How did the business start and how has it grown The business was created by a fusion of expertise to achieve sales growth, including experienced digital marketers, PR consultants, web developers, software developers, graphic designers, illustrators and motion designers. I co-founded the company with expert digital marketer Denis Finnegan who has spent  years fuelling online lead generation for businesses. Growth has been swt over the last  months. We’ve employed an effective combination of marketing efforts and created fans of our existing clients.What is your background I’m a seasoned hack, having worked in print journalism for almost  years followed by a few years as a political communications adviser. I spent a brief period teaching English and history at secondary level before entering a newsroom. The working environments were poles apart in terms pace, excitement and... language choices. As a school pupil and university student, I worked on building sites, supermarkets, farms, bars, bread delivery vans, a bakery and even a bacon factory kill-line. However, I had never encountered such flurries of expletives as I did in newsrooms. Great places to work. High pressure, tight deadlines and great target-setting – a superb way to fuel productivity in any work environment.What do you do dferently from your competition and what are your strengths Clear communication with our clients is our greatest strength. We listen intently to what our clients’ goals are, take time to learn about their products and gain full understanding of their ideal customers. We start with a blank canvass and devise bespoke digital strategies to fuel each client’s business growth by engaging their target market effectively and delivering genuine sales leads that are easily quantiable.Who are your main customers Our customers operate across a wide range of sectors. We are currently working with clients across the UK and Ireland, US, France and Spain. Do you have a target in mind in terms of where you want the business to grow We are currently focusing the bulk of our efforts on the island of Ireland with a particular focus on Dublin and Belfast. What challenges have you faced The somewhat ‘snake-oil industry’ reputation of digital marketing sometimes poses a barrier to speaking with decision makers who in the past have invested with little . However, once we’re given an opportunity, we like to let the results do the talking. Who most inspires you Those who thrive in the face of adversity and have strong growth mind-sets. The type of person with the right measure of accountability, skill and relentlessness to inspire their teams to achieve targets. It’s a mind-set akin to that of a top athlete whose body is screaming ‘slow down’ in the business end of a race but whose mind interprets that as a cue to go faster. My we Martina – a former operations manager with Lidl Ireland who co-founded and runs leading human resources consultancy, HR Team – has these qualities in abundance. She inspires me in everything I do.Where do you see yourself in the next few years I love living and working in the North West. Whatever people like to call Derry or Londonderry, it’s a very special place with a lot of talent and a big future in driving the cross-border regional economy. With our headquarters at Catalyst Inc and plans underway for satellite offices in Dublin and the UK, we want to ensure our agency plays a part in shaping that economic prosperity with the provision of more high-quality jobs for the area.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/js_1.jpg","title":"uncertainty interconnectors and the future of ni energy post brexit","story":"Posted on Monday February  by Ulster Business With a potential ‘no deal’ around the corner on Brexit, what will that mean for the future of Northern Ireland’s energy policy – especially on renewables, the I-SEM all-island market and power generation  John Simpson takes a closer look On the last working day before Christmas , the System Operator for Northern Irelandpublished draft proposals of how the electricity systems and grids on this island may operate in -. Subject to confirmation by the all-island Single Electricity Market Committee, the auction for electricity generators to be awarded capacity contracts, on an all-island basis, has identied electricity capacityof , MW which will be in place for the year starting October ,  – , MW of that all-island total is attributed to Northern Ireland.This is a critical series of draft decisions which will reassure the large conventional generators about their contracts and will impose the discipline of revenue limits constrained by the capacity auction. The draft decisions also point to the expectations in terms of the capacity earmarked from renewable sources, from inter-connection with the Scottish grid and the capacity adjustments that may follow from demand-side adjustment contracts.SONI has not been as open and transparent as should have been possible. Readers must make the assumption that ties location to where capacity payments are identied in sterling and euro.The SONI statement lists  generator names ,  of which are identied as DSUswhich leaves  others. Eight are shown as part of the AES capacity in Ballylumford and Kilroot: four are small capacity generators, six each have capacity of over MW , and the last capacity source linked to Northern Ireland is the Moyle Interconnector.SONI does not present the capacity awards in a way that allows readers to identy the location of each successful unit.The Utility Regulator has agreed that the available Northern Ireland capacity should include  MW from the Moyle Interconnector which represents over % of locally available capacity. This is a judgement that might be queried. Is the interconnectora guaranteed source of capacity  If, at a time of peak demand in Northern Ireland, demand in the grid in GB had no spare capacity, presumably the capacity might not be available for supply to Northern Ireland. The regulator and SONI are well placed to judge the probability of this outcome and might argue that it is a minimal risk.There are some interesting features stemming from the assumptions made in setting the framework for the capacity auction. First, Northern Ireland has been treated as meriting some contract iations because of locational constraints. This is a reflection of the limited capacity of the electricity grid on the whole island to send electricity to the places where there is demand. Both the Dublin area and Northern Irelanddid not attract auction bids adequately to supply these area locational constraints. For Northern Ireland. the easy explanation lies in the absence of the long awaited north-south grid expansion from to the planned distribution hub in Co Tyrone.The capacity auction allowed for the acceptance of bids with prices which are higher than the main auction prices which would match supply and demand across the whole island. Because of the locational deficit, some Northern Ireland bids now show capacity payment prices above the all-Ireland ceiling of £, per MW which applies to most of the successful bids.In the quotation from AES for the two large fossil fuel burning units, the proposal is that they should attract payment prices of £, and £, per MW. At first sight this appears to allow a premium of nearly % on the payment price for each MW. This seems more than a marginal cost and points to the possible cost savingsthe proposed new north-south link had been operational.This answer for the older high capacity units at Kilroot is a further reflection of the doubt about the continued viability of these units. It will be remembered that a year ago, these same two units were deemed unsuccessful in the auction but, at a late stage when faced with a request for a derogation to be allowed to close these units, the initially agreed settlement was revised.A year ago, the first capacity auction under the rules of the newly instituted I-SEM, was accepted with a capacity supply of near to , MW for all of Northern Ireland. Now, in early , SONI has concluded that for security of supply Northern Ireland should contract for just under , MW. There is no obvious major uplt in demand in Northern Ireland so that, quietly, the suggestion is that the arithmetic in late  may now be thought to have been slightly too risky.The capacity auction is a fundamental building block of electricity supply policy for Northern Ireland. However, on its own, the allocation of capacity and the possible scope for investment in new generating capacity must also be seen in the context of increasing,market forces allow, the proportion of electricity supply that is supplied from renewable sources. The distribution of generating capacity is still dominated by fossil fuels. Northern Ireland’s capacity is nearly % from gas andcoal. However, the statistics showing the proportion of electricity supply from renewables points to average consumption from renewables of nearer to -%. Because of the iability in the contribution of wind based renewables, it would be hazardousgreater security dependence was allocated to renewables.In turn, the caveat about the possible role of renewables points to the possible value of further investment in energy storage for which no major scheme has been launched. If Kilroot power station survives for a further three to four years, then the experimental electricity storage capacity on that site may become an attractive asset.There are several continuing questions about Northern Ireland’s security of electricity supply. Will Kilroot be given further stays of execution after   Will the North South interconnector eventually be built  Will the proposed large natural gas burning power station be built in Belfast  Will the politically unpopular investment in anaerobic digestion plants be tackled  Will the Brexit settlement, or lack of it, damage the continued operation of the all-island single electricity market  But... it seems Kilroot has been given a temporary extension of its role in keeping the lights on.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
