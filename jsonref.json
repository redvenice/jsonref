Essentially this case is going to take up the rest of this year and if it takes up the rest of this year, that\u0027s the whole of his mother\u0027s Platinum Jubilee.\u0027The only thing he could have done to stop this getting worse is to have pulled the case and stopped it in some way so there was no alternative news.

But he was a man of his time,’ says one alumnus. ‘The way Jesus is treating him, you’d have thought he spent his life flogging plantation workers. In reality, he was a wealthy courtier in London who made business investments, probably because the King told him to. But because a tiny proportion of these involved slavery, his entire legacy is being shredded.‘If this stands, where does it lead? Will people in 100 years be combing through donors to cancel people whose pensions were invested in oil or tobacco firms?’Many alumni are understood to have cancelled monthly donations to the College in protest.Meanwhile, the Rustat Memorial Group has lodged a formal objection to the College’s proposals.In court next week, they are expected to argue, among other things, that Rustat’s investment in the slave trade was marginal in the context of his life, and that the College, which claimed on its website that he ‘derived great wealth’ from the Royal African Company, has misinterpreted the evidence.The group’s expert witnesses include Nigel Biggar, a distinguished Oxford professor who once upset the forces of political correctness by describing the British Empire as ‘morally mixed’.Also keeping a watchful eye on proceedings will be descendants of Rustat. One, former Chief Scientist at English Heritage Sebastian Payne — who is descended from Rustat’s brother, Robert — regards the removal of the monument as a sort of desecration of his ancestor’s grave, since it was his dying wish to be buried nearby.High-profile figures within Cambridge have also criticised the case.Prof David Abulafia, an emeritus professor of history at Cambridge, has described the shaming of Rustat as ‘virtue-signalling’. Dr Colin Kolbert, emeritus professor of law at Magdalene College, accuses Jesus of ‘entirely empty gestures’, telling me: ‘If the College really cared about having a clean conscience, they’d be giving back the money he gave them.’In response, Jesus says that returning cash would breach charity law, and argues: ‘The College is not seeking to cancel Rustat. It is applying to have his memorial moved from a place of worship to a more suitable — but still prominent — place in the College.’The fate of that ambition will soon rest in the hands of His Honour Judge David Hodge QC.While the outcome is hard to predict, the whole thing will be expensive. Bringing the case will cost Jesus around £55,000, while relocating the memorial in a listed building could cost £30,000.Even if Jesus wins, opponents are likely to appeal, pushing costs (which, since the college is a Charity, come from charitable funds) still higher.Luckily, the College has deep pockets: it’s worth around £350 million, thanks to benefactors such as the late Tobias Rustat — not to mention some deep-pocketed Chinese Communists, too."},{"url":null,"title":"Biden signals troops Eastern Europe near term","story":"Share this articleRussia Positioning Helicopters, in Possible Sign of Ukraine Plans - The New York TimesAnalysis: New discord between Ukraine and US plays right into Putin\u0027s hands - CNNPoliticsAnalysis: New discord between Ukraine and US plays right into Putin\u0027s hands - CNNPoliticsRussia ready to mount complete takeover of Ukraine in two weeks, West fears | News | The Times‘We don’t have a Titanic here’: Ukraine plays down threat of Russian invasion | Volodymyr Zelenskiy | The GuardianUkrainian president downplays U.S. assessment of imminent invasion - POLITICO"},{"url":null,"title":"Pregnant insurance broker sacked looking prams online work hours","story":"Share this article \u0027She was not sure of the time she looked at the various websites, but stated that they could have been during her breaks.\u0027A disciplinary investigation was launched, during which she admitted to checking the emails of colleagues, including managers, and adding inboxes to her own Outlook account.The tribunal said: \u0027Miss Mowatt explained that she had started this from just before she stepped down as manager as she felt she was being left out of things such as emails and WhatsApp groups.\u0027The tribunal heard many of the emails she viewed had nothing to do with her and included return to work after sickness documents from other members of staff.The panel found: \u0027She had not searched for herself in the emails by name but was conducting a general browsing where she did not appear to be looking for anything specific.\u0027The emails were viewed at multiple points throughout the working day.\u0027She was fired but later sued her employer for victimisation and unfair dismissal after viewing emails between managers in which one called her a \u0027f***ing muppet\u0027. But the tribunal threw out her claims.Employment Judge Neil Maidment said: \u0027Miss Mowatt\u0027s viewing of colleagues\u0027 emails was calculated, sustained and extremely wide ranging involving her not simply in searching for references to herself but viewing correspondence which had nothing whatsoever to do with her and which in some cases was of a private nature.\u0027One Call Insurance did not act outside the band of reasonable responses in considering that there was such a loss of faith and trust in Miss Mowatt that it could no longer sustain her employment.\u0027  "},{"url":null,"title":"Its Britains fertile land theres plan cover 2 800 acres solar panels","story":"Share this articleShare this article ‘It’s simple things like that which to a lot of people are vital for their mental health.

Photograph: iStockThe Leaving Cert may end up as a traditional exam this summer with additional choice for students after officials ruled out the use of “school profiling” for a hybrid model.Taoiseach Micheál Martin and other party leaders were informed by senior officials earlier this week that a hybrid or accredited grades model – based on teachers’ estimates – might need to draw on schools’ historical results in the Junior Cert exams.This is due to the absence of exam data for about 25 per cent of this year’s Leaving Cert candidates, who did not sit the Junior Cert in 2020 when it was cancelled due to Covid-19 concerns.This data is regarded as crucial in the standardisation process, which aims to ensure teachers’ estimated grades in different schools are equitably awarded.However, Government sources said the use of this data has now been ruled out in the event that some form of accredited grades is used because it could prove to be as “too problematic”.A decision on the format of this year’s Leaving Cert is likely in the next week or so.The Government had planned to use school profiling in 2020 when Leaving Cert exams were first replaced by a system based on teachers’ estimates.However, it dropped the plan following opposition claims this could penalise students attending school in disadvantaged areas.Officials are now understood to be examining whether it is possible to generate accredited grades in a different way that is fair and equitable.One Government source said it was their understanding that Leaving Cert options have now narrowed. “It seems to be edging towards traditional exams this year, with greater choice for students,” they said.DisruptionWhile additional choice in questions in the forthcoming State exams were announced last August, officials have been exploring ways of going further due to the level of Covid-related disruption which has occurred since.This could see a similar level of choice incorporated into the summer exams as was used last year.Another Government source said all options were still being considered and nothing had been ruled out. “Things are still at a delicate stage,” they said.Students are calling for the introduction of a hybrid Leaving Cert on the basis that many have experienced significant disruption to their studies due to the pandemic.Teachers’ unions are opposed to grading their students for the purposes of the Leaving Cert and say further adjustments to the exams are needed.It is understood Mr Martin, along with Tánaiste Leo Varadkar and Green Party leader Eamon Ryan, were briefed on potential options for the format of this year’s exam on Monday by Minister for Education Norma Foley and her officials.The decision to omit school profiling in the 2020 Leaving Cert was at the centre of an legal challenge taken by Belvedere College student Freddie Sherry, who argued that the decision impacted unfairly on his results.However, the High Court ruled that the Government was fully entitled to make changes to the standardisation model which they considered to be in the public interest.It found that Mr Sherry had not shown he, or Belvedere, were subject of an unfairness arising from the final approach taken and had “certainly not” established an unfairness that would lead the court to conclude the system was unlawful.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"small number of omicron sub lineage detected in state","story":"Cillian De Gascun, director of the National Virus Reference Laboratory, said there are indications that the presence of BA.2 could be rising. Photograph: Colin KeeganCollinsThere has been a “small number” of cases of a sub-lineage of the Omicron variant detected in the State, a public health official has said.However, Cillian De Gascun, director of the National Virus Reference Laboratory, said there are indications that the presence of BA.2 could be rising.According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), the Omicron variant has three main sub-lineages: BA.1, BA.2 and BA.3.BA.1 was largely responsible for the surge in Omicron cases over the winter period, according to the WHO, which resulted in record-breaking case numbers detected in many countries.However, the prevalance of the BA.2 sub-lineage has increased internationally in recent weeks. It has already become dominant in Denmark and is likely to become dominant in the UK in the coming weeks.The UK Health Security Agency has declared the sub-lineage a “variant of investigation”, with early analysis suggesting it has a growth advantage when compared to BA.1.SeverityThere is currently no data on the severity of BA.2 compared to BA.1, and a preliminary assessment by UK officials did not find a difference in vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic disease between the two.In response to questions from The , Mr De Gascun said the UK risk assessment “doesn’t give too much cause for alarm at this stage”.The difference in mutations between the two subtypes allows officials to monitor the emergence of BA.1 through genome sequencing, he added.“So, while we’ve seen only small numbers of BA.2 cases in our sequencing to date, the SGTF proportion has declined from 97 per cent to 93 per cent over the last few days, so that could signal the start of something, which we will of course continue to monitor,” Mr de Gascun said.Genome sequencingAccording to figures from the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC), some 2,936 cases of Covid-19 in Ireland have been identified as the Omicron variant through genome sequencing between November 25th and January 17th.Of those, 2,926 were BA.1, nine were BA.2 and one was BA.3.The WHO has said that investigation into the characteristics of BA.2, including virulence, should be “prioritised independently (and comparatively) to BA.1”.Meanwhile, the National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) reported an additional 5,109 PCR-confirmed cases of Covid-19 on Friday.In addition, 4,482 people registered a positive antigen test through the HSE portal on Thursday.As of 8am on Friday, 707 Covid-19 patients were hospitalised, of whom 69 were in ICU.The Department of Health said it will no longer report daily case numbers at the weekends.

The deal had been worked on at the highest levels of the Department of Foreign Affairs, with Minster for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney personally involved.The last few days and nights have seen a frenzy of intense activity to finalise the deal.The 46-year-old father of four had been prevented from leaving China since February 2019 over a legal dispute involving a Dublin-based aircraft leasing firm that he worked for.The businessman was caught up in the dispute between the Chinese authority and Min Jiedong, the chairman and main shareholder of the Dublin firm China International Aviation Leasing Service, where he is a director.The dispute centred on Min’s raising of funds from Chinese investors in a crowdfunding scheme to buy an Airbus aircraft. This predated Mr O’Halloran’s employment with the company.The aircraft has been leased on a long-term arrangement with a Finnish airline.Mr O’Halloran attempted to leave China in February 2019 after testifying against Min but was stopped by Chinese police and told that an exit ban was placed on his passport.The Dubliner was not suspected of any wrongdoing nor was he charged with any crime, but his exit was blocked as the Chinese authorities sought the return of investors’ money in full.At one point, Shanghai police demanded $36 million (€30 million).The Dublin company was not in a position to repay the money in full but under an agreement drafted by Irish businessman Ulick McEvaddy, who became a director of the company to try to secure Mr O’Halloran’s release, monthly repayments have been made to the Chinese authorities from the lease income on the aircraft.More than $100,000 (€90,000) per month is being paid under that agreement.Mr O’Halloran’s family have repeatedly spoken of the mental and physical toll on the businessman due to his detention in China.\u0026nbspThey are not expected to make a public statement about his release until after he lands back in Dublin.His family are said to be “delighted” that he has been allowed to leave China and with Mr Coveney’s statement on his release, and are looking forward to his return home.While Mr O’Halloran had been prevented from leaving, he had been permitted to live freely in the country.Mr Coveney travelled to China last year to meet his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi where he asked for Mr O’Halloran to be released.Department of Foreign Affairs officials have been working on his case in the background over recent years.President Michael D Higgins, Irish TDs and European MEPs are among those who have lobbied extensively for Mr O’Halloran’s release.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"china to receive years of payments for irish businessman s return","story":"Richard O’Halloran speaking to RTÉ’s Prime Time from China Significant payments will continue to Chinese authorities for years following a deal struck to enable the return of Irish businessman Richard O’Halloran from China.Mr O’Halloran was permitted to leave China on Friday following an enforced stay of almost three years after becoming embroiled in a legal dispute involving the chairman and main shareholder of his Dublin-based company.He initially flew to China in 2019 during the fallout from a crowdsourcing deal for an aircraft owned by his employer, China International Aviation Leasing Service.However, despite giving evidence against the firm’s one-time chairman Min Jiedong , who was convicted of offences relating to the deal, Mr O’Halloran was prevented from leaving.At one stage, €30 million was demanded of Mr O’Halloran, while hundreds of thousands of euro were paid over to the Chinese authorities derived from income associated with the lease of the plane purchased under the original crowdsourcing deal.Future commitmentsMr O’Halloran had to make two court appearances in Shanghai earlier this week to finalise and sign off on financial arrangements and future commitments to pave the way for the lifting of the exit ban.It is understood the financial commitments relate to future payments from the income on the aircraft that was purchased with money raised from Chinese investors and leased to a Finnish airline.The agreement is also understood to relate to the return of the aircraft to the Chinese authorities when the lease agreement ends in 2026.

It is understood that his wife, Tara O’Halloran, had been set to appear before the Oireachtas Committee on Foreign Affairs next week.Mr O’Halloran, a father of four, is expected back in Dublin on Saturday.However, there was criticism for the Government. Fianna Fáil MEP Barry Andrews, who lobbied for Mr O’Halloran’s release, said he was “puzzled” that Mr Coveney expressed gratitude to the Chinese authorities for their help when they were responsible for his detention.“It surprised me because it implies the Chinese authorities were blameless in the matter and clearly they weren’t,” he said.“This was a negotiation between the Irish and Chinese authorities. The implication of that is that the Chinese authorities were controlling the process and a process that had no basis in law.”Mr Andrews also criticised the Department of Foreign Affairs for not using the resources of the European Union’s delegation in Beijing to help in Mr O’Halloran’s case.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"post brexit checks for goods moving into north are not fit for purpose eu officials","story":"An anti-NI protocol sign near Larne port, one of the locations of post-Brexit agrifood checks. File photograph: Mark MarlowBloombergEU officials have said that the system for post-Brexit checks on goods moving from Britain to Northern Ireland is “not fit for purpose”.A draft report by EU officials, compiled following an audit carried out by the European Commission in June last year, is highly critical of the current system of agrifood checks and recommends a series of changes.Officials say the UK government has “failed to ensure that sufficient resources – human and structural – have been made available to the responsible competent authorities in Northern Ireland”.Since the UK left the EU, new trade arrangements have created economic barriers on the movement of goods between Britain and Northern Ireland, with the aim being to avoid the creation of a hard Border on the island of Ireland.The latter has been achieved by effectively keeping Northern Ireland within the EU’s single market for goods, which has led to the checks on agrifood products crossing the Irish Sea into Northern Ireland from Britain.Staffing was cited as a major issue, with EU officials bemoaning an insufficient number of “suitably qualified staff so that official controls and other official activities can be performed efficiently and effectively”.‘Stunt’This week, Stormont’s DUP First Minister Paul Givan said his party colleague Edwin Poots will order a stop to the controversial checks, but the anticipated move by the North’s Minister for Agriculture has been branded a stunt by other parties in Northern Ireland.The other Executive parties insist Mr Poots does not have the authority to prevent checks required under the terms of the EU-UK Brexit withdrawal agreement, an international treaty.Unionists parties and loyalist groups have long been opposed to the post-Brexit trading arrangements for Northern Ireland, arguing that they damage the union between the region and Britain.The UK and the EU remain in talks as both sides attempt to reach a deal on issues relating to the Northern Ireland protocol, the portion of the withdrawal agreement that has given rise to the trading arrangements.Among the recommendations contained in the report are calls to ensure that the authorities have access to a sufficient number of qualified staff, as well as pointing out the need for better facilities and improved information-sharing.“Undertakings given in the United Kingdom’s unilateral declarations have also not been delivered,” the report concludes.“The system in place for controlling the entry of animals and goods into the EU SPS area via Northern Ireland border control posts does not, and cannot in the current circumstances, function effectively.” – PA How is Brexit affecting you?

It takes seconds to post on social media but the fallout can last much longer. It’s important to think before you post, particularly when a matter is the subject of court proceedings or a Garda investigation. Being fair and accurate is crucial. The potentially serious consequences for overstepping the legal lines include a fine, and even jail, for contempt of court or damages for defamation. Here’s a guide to help stay on the right side of the law when you’re online. What’s the legal position when a person is arrested in connection with a criminal offence?The matter is deemed to be sub judice, meaning it’s before a court or judge, and there are clear limits on what can and cannot be said. From the time an inidual is arrestedcharged, the facts are for a court to decide. An inidual arrested and questioned in connection with a criminal offence should not be identified prior to being charged.Why can’t more details be given?Because we operate in a democracy governed by the rule of law. An accused is entitled to the presumption of innocence unless and until proven guilty. Public discussion of the case, which can sometimes be ill-informed, could prejudice a jury whose role is to decide the facts.So what can I say? It’s best to say nothing when a matter is subject of criminal proceedings. There are good reasons for this, including that information circulated about an accused or crime is sometimes inaccurate and whipping up public opinion against accused people has contributed in the past to people being convicted of offences they didn’t commit. What happens if an arrestedcharged person is identified? It depends on what is said. Anyone who publishes negative material about someone who is arrested leaves themselves open to contempt of court andor defamation proceedings. When material about a charged person, or details of the offence with which they are charged, is published, the consequences can be serious. Apart from exposing its publisher to defamation and contempt proceedings, such publication has potential to derail or even collapse a jury trial.What does defamation mean?Defamation is the publication to at least one other person of comment, inaccurate statements, false reporting or other material capable of causing damage to the reputation of a person, business or other organisation. The Defamation Act 2009 defines a “defamatory statement” as one “that tends to injure a person’s reputation in the eyes of reasonable members of society”. Anyone suing for defamation has to show there was “publication, by any means” of defamatory material concerning them to one, or more than one, person. The Act applies to ALL publications and there is a rising number of cases alleging defamation and contempt of court over online content, including social media posts. A couple received €30,000 damages against their neighbour in county Donegal who had put up a Facebook post making allegations including of an affair. Surely I can say what I like to my friends and family in my WhatsApp groups?There’s a risk in saying what you like, even on WhatsApp, if the content is defamatory. Online defamation is the publication of defamatory statements in e-mails, web postings, Facebook posts, tweets and mobile phone group messaging such as WhatsApp groups. A retweet or simple forwarding of a message can be akin to acting as the original publisher, particularly if further comment is added.What about the likes of Google, Facebook and Twitter? Can they be sued over what’s posted on their sites? E-commerce regulations mean intermediaries such as Google, Facebook and Twitter are excluded from liability under a “hosting defence” for material published on their systems where they are unaware of the defamatory, false or criminal content. If intermediaries are given notice of defamatory material, they are expected to take it down speedily if they want to benefit from the hosting defence and are not deemed to be a publisher. Orders may also be sought against internet service providers aimed at identifying posters of defamatory material. Anonymity online is not absolute due to protocols on device and internet addressing.

most of which are Labour-run - have written to parents explaining that pupils should continue wearing face coverings in corridors either until the end of January, until February half-term, or until further notice.Some cite high rates of Covid case numbers in the local area, while others say it is a precautionary measure aimed at protecting the school community.A further six councils, who are responsible for another 380,000 children, have said they support headteachers to make their own decision about face masks.Nadhim Zahawi, the Education Secretary, insisted last week that “all schools” should banish face masks so that children could “enjoy a normal experience” in the classroom.The Government updated its official advice last week to say that face masks in the classrooms would no longer be required from January 20.And from January 27, masks are not required for teachers or pupils in communal areas such as corridors.The Department for Education (DfE) has written to every headteacher in England to reiterate that masks were only introduced as a “temporary measure” and that they were “no longer recommended in classrooms”.Mr Zahawi said local directors of public health could reintroduce face masks in the event of an “extraordinary” outbreak with his express permission.Seven councils - including Central Bedfordshire, Tameside and Rotherham - are recommending that masks continue until February half-term.Another five councils - Barking and Dagenham, Blackpool, Salford, Wigan and Derby - say masks should continue until further notice, while Bradford says they should continue until the end of the month.Officials at the DfE declined to say whether any of the councils which have reimposed masks have sought or obtained permission from ministers.Council chiefs have been accused of imposing “draconian” rules on school children which go further than what is asked of adults.Arabella Skinner, director of the parent campaign group UsForThem, said parents were “furious” that face masks still being insisted upon in schools“As we have seen throughout the pandemic, local public health directors - who are unelected - have taken it on themselves to issue their own more draconian rules for schools,” she said.“It is notable that they only ever appear to issue these to school children and not to wider society. Parents who live in these areas are furious that their children are subject to this postcode lotteryThe SNP’s “despised” mask mandate in schools must be ditched immediately due to growing evidence it is harming children’s social skills and mental health, headteachers have warned.Dorothy MacGinty, head teacher at Kilgraston School in Perthshire, and Rod Grant, headmaster at Clifton Hall in Edinburgh, said lessons were becoming increasingly difficult to deliver and that normal interactions were being lost.It was claimed that children were coming “bottom of the government’s priority list” and that their civil liberties were being unfairly curtailed.However, Nicola Sturgeon has so far refused to agree to any change, with the mask rules backed by the powerful EIS teaching union which SNP ministers are reluctant to defy.In a letter to The , Ms MacGinty called on the Scottish Government to “be bold enough” to finally scrap the rule and warned “learning is being critically, perhaps irreversibly, hampered by their use.”Earlier this week The  revealed that schools are continuing with their own Plan B measures such as keeping libraries closed, banning hot lunches and insisting on face masks.A DfE spokesman said that face-to-face education for all students “continues to be our top priority”.They added: “We kept our promise and removed the requirement for face coverings to be worn in the classroom as quickly as possible, and have now also removed the requirement for them to be worn in communal areas, in line with the national move out of Plan B.“Our guidance applies to all schools - and if required local teams from the department work with inidual schools to support them in implementing the guidance.”More from NewsTurf war with a twist: Pensioner rips up neighbours’ flowers at 3am in garden rowWhy the Met Police suddenly changed its mind on redacting the Sue Gray reportCarrie Johnson offered to bring cake to Boris Johnson’s alleged lockdown-busting birthday partyDemocracy itself is imperilled when the political sphere is invaded by officialdomBoris Johnson lines up Sir Lynton Crosby ally and high flying civil servant for No 10 rebootShould he stay or should he go?

Whether or not it causes more severe disease will become apparent as more data is collected.“Of course, it is important to keep monitoring the situation and try to gain a better understanding of how this variant behaves, but so far there is nothing in these early analyses to worry us unduly.”The new UKHSA report also confirmed that the recent rise in coronavirus infections in care homes has not led to an increase in hospital admissions.Health officials said the findings suggest the current wave of omicron infections is unlikely to lead to a major surge in severe disease in care home populations with high levels of vaccine coverage or natural immunity.Professor John Edmunds, an epidemiologist at London School of Hygiene \u0026amp Tropical Medicine, said it was possible that BA.2 could take over from the original omicron strain in the next few weeks, as it has done in Denmark.He added: “The good news is that, at present, there is no evidence to suggest that it is more severe than omicron and as the UKHSA analysis shows, the vaccines appear to be as effective against it as they are against BA.1.”More from NewsTurf war with a twist: Pensioner rips up neighbours’ flowers at 3am in garden rowWhy the Met Police suddenly changed its mind on redacting the Sue Gray reportCarrie Johnson offered to bring cake to Boris Johnson’s alleged lockdown-busting birthday partyDemocracy itself is imperilled when the political sphere is invaded by officialdomBoris Johnson lines up Sir Lynton Crosby ally and high flying civil servant for No 10 rebootShould he stay or should he go?

The \u0027partygate\u0027 report was expected to be released as soon as Wednesday, but remains in limbo as legal checks delay its publication.  readers looked ahead to what the report\u0027s findings could ultimately mean for Boris Johnson’s premiership. Elsewhere, the crisis in Ukraine was a big topic of conversation this week, as the dispute with Russia continued to heighten. Our readers focused the discussion on the West’s involvement in the crisis, as Boris Johnson confirmed on Tuesday that the UK would contribute to Nato deployments in the event of a Russian invasion. Read on to find out what our readers had to say about these stories and the week\u0027s biggest talking points.Camilla Tominey assessed the \u0027partygate\u0027 scandal so far and concluded that aspects of the situation, such as Ms Gray’s desire to have the report published in full, suggest that there is only so much power the most powerful man in the country can wield. Our readers expressed their disappointment over the scandal and discussed whether Boris Johnson could and should survive \u0027partygate\u0027.I was a big supporter of Boris Johnson that changed when it became apparent that he had lied to Parliament and the people, who took him at his word and trusted him with their votes. \u0027Partygate\u0027 was the catalyst that exposed the true Mr Johnson, a man who thinks rules and laws are for other people. When one’s integrity is lost, trust is lost. We need to find another leader, so who is going to stand up to the plate?There\u0027s much mediocrity in Westminster. One would hope for good judgement at the top, but that looks severely lacking. It seems evident that there is a lot of sweating over this impending report, and attempts to redact parts of it. The suggestion that the appointment of a new Prime Minister would require a general election for a mandate is absolute desperation.I would happily see Boris Johnson held to account for his handling of the Covid crisis and lockdowns. That won’t happen within the context of this current process. The people manoeuvring to bring him down are up to their necks in the devastation that lockdowns have caused and would probably happily resume them tomorrow.Boris Johnson should stay, for now. It is up to the public to announce his time is up, not political enemies who would have happily overturned the 2016 Brexit vote (in which I voted to remain) and the 2019 General Election result.If Boris Johnson does go down for lockdown breaches then every single MP, civil servant, public health official, clinician and journalist who did likewise should also lose their jobs.In summarising the stances taken by Western countries in the handling of the Ukraine crisis, our columnist Sherelle Jacobs believes that the US and Europe risk tipping into a death spiral of humiliation and decline. Our readers took to the comments section to voice what they think has made the West so weak.I do think that liberal democracy is worth fighting for but I don\u0027t know anywhere that has one. Why America is always held up as a shining example of a perfect state is beyond me - you have to be a billionaire to be President, there isn\u0027t universal suffrage and the separation of powers is non-existent.As with the UK, the system is ruled by the increasingly mega rich at the expense of a stable, hard working middle and working class. Crime and the criminal classes are flourishing. As for \u0027freedoms\u0027, Covid has shown how easy it is for \u0027democracies\u0027 to take these away for years without any appeal by its own citizens, most of whom acquiesce weakly.Here in Western Australia the state government has announced an extension of draconian rules which prevent its own citizens returning to their homes, not just from abroad but from other areas of Australia. This has now been going on for two years and counting, separating families and causing immense hardship.It\u0027s been on the cards for a long time and it looks increasingly as if Vladimir Putin will march into another of his neighbouring countries and take what he wants. Sadly, the West can only look on, but it will most likely do nothing more than make a lot of empty threats and utter a lot of sanctimonious platitudes.That won\u0027t worry Russia one iota - whilst the West is busy wallowing in self-recrimination, wokeness, saving the planet, trying to control nature and all the other nonsense that only the decadent and smug thinks important, Russia has ambitions and it will simply march on, unopposed.Countries that no longer care about affairs beyond their own borders will eventually go into decline and lose their influence and purpose. The cards have been on the table for a long time.Outsourcing industrial activity to China and other Asian nations because of their lower labour costs was a huge error. It offset our carbon emissions and salved out guilty imperial consciences. It also made China rich, powerful and able to bully the rest of the world.Our national organisations are staffed by apologists for something, anything and everything. Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping watch on, open mouthed and incredulous.Our Moscow correspondent, Nataliya Vasilyeva, and senior foreign correspondent, Roland Oliphant, answer your questions on the Ukraine crisis, here.Boris Johnson confirmed that holidaymakers who are fully vaccinated will no longer have to take any Covid tests for travel abroad. Our readers agreed in believing that this is a positive step in the right direction, but some were still weary of how this could affect the spread of the virus.I don’t want to go abroad yet. Most politicians are still too volatile and the rules are changing too much and too often. What a nightmare if one of your group tests positive before or during your trip. What a nightmare if the rules change between booking and going away. What a nightmare if there’s an outbreak at your destination shortly before or during your stay. All the what ifs completely spoil the idea.I am starting to look at where to go in a few years time. Anywhere crazy like Australia, Canada and most of Europe are off the cards. But Mexico, Croatia and Cape Verde are looking promising at the moment.\u0027This is ridiculous logic. You can still spread Covid jabbed or unjabbed. The only thing that had an iota of sense were the tests. Totally and utterly nonsensical thinking. It is following the same pattern of stupid decision-making throughout this pandemic.A move in the right direction but, as usual, no detail to help travel agents field the volume of calls as to what defines \u0027vaccinated\u0027. Never was so much harm done to outbound and inbound travel for so little.Nigel Gardiner highlighted this week that previous US Brexit opponents, such as the Washington Post and New York Times, are now seeing the positives of Britain\u0027s exit from the EU, especially during the current Ukraine crisis.  readers discuss their thoughts on Britain’s stance as a pillar of freedom in Europe.It is no coincidence that Britain is freer now to make significant contributions to international affairs. That always was one of the main points of Brexit. Leavers did not want our foreign policy to be submerged in the feeble, negative, self absorbed policies of the EU. Brexit was never only about GDP.Just confirms the US has no idea about politics inside or outside the US. The EU’s silence over the Ukraine crisis is deafening, from Germany and France in particular. We ignored Barack Obama’s meddling just before the referendum and Joe Biden\u0027s dislike of the UK is completely misguided. The best thing this country has done is leave the EU, and that is what Remainers still can’t accept.No one knows better than us how one incursion into a foreign country leads to more and more countries being overtaken. Again history plays its vital role in understanding what has happened in the past has the potential to be repeated. The EU’s approach of \u0027let sleeping dogs lie\u0027, pretending that nothing is going to happen and anyway if it does, it’s not our problem, echoes the mantra of see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil. Fortunately, we have such excellent Intelligence Services that we understand how Vladimir Putin’s mind works. Brexiteers are proud of our country and our globalist approach, but they desired to be rid of the EU’s shackles.With many office workers returning to their desks this week, Lucy Burton argued that commuting is just too miserable with overpriced, overcrowded trains and high omicron cases.  readers took to the comments to share whether they will be returning to the office or not.Commuting can be a great way to add incidental exercise and socialising to your day. It is also time to think andor do something a bit different like read a book. My commute is a mixture of walking and a short train journey. It has never felt like a waste of time and puts a nice barrier between home and work. I’m looking forward to going back to it.This seems to be an entirely train-orientated article, aimed at the London-centric commuter. Millions of people do not live or work in London or another big city. Most live outside London and get in their cars to commute 5, 10 or 20 miles each way to their office. Public transport is either unavailable or so slow and distant from their start or end points that it is irrelevant. Remote working for these commuters is a benefit in so many ways, both to the employee and the employer.For those that care about such things, just think of the \u0027carbon footprint\u0027 of commuting by road. The Government will keep pushing the benefits of public transport, while leaving most of the population no choice but to use their cars.After a huge investment in IT and equipment to enable staff to work from home, few employers are going to demand all staff return to the office full time. As for those who consider home workers lazy, I have found my personal output far greater while working from home by being able to get my head down without all the interruptions and chit-chat of the office.Find out what current stories are getting our readers talking by visiting the  Community HubMore from NewsTurf war with a twist: Pensioner rips up neighbours’ flowers at 3am in garden rowWhy the Met Police suddenly changed its mind on redacting the Sue Gray reportCarrie Johnson offered to bring cake to Boris Johnson’s alleged lockdown-busting birthday partyDemocracy itself is imperilled when the political sphere is invaded by officialdomBoris Johnson lines up Sir Lynton Crosby ally and high flying civil servant for No 10 rebootShould he stay or should he go?

But almost three years after the inquiry was launched, ministers have now decided it will not be released. DWP minister Baroness Stedman-Scott admitted: “We were unable to assess the deterrent effect. “Therefore this research doesn’t present a comprehensive picture of sanctions.” This week the DWP refused a Freedom of Information request to release any part of the report. Officials claimed releasing it would hurt the “free and frank exchange of views” in government.  Despite admitting it could “provide a greater understanding of the effectiveness of benefit sanctions”, they said it was important to consider the “deterrent” effect of sanctions - in other words, the fear of getting a sanction rather than the sanction itself. “Without this, the research is incomplete,” they claimed. Dr David Webster, a University of Glasgow academic who made the request, now plans to appeal. He told the : “It doesn’t look good when the DWP launches a new sanctions policy and does not let the public see the evidence that might help them to judge it.”The DWP faced an angry backlash this week for launching a new sanctions crackdown on benefit claimants. Under new rules, people will have their benefits stopped just four weeks after making a Universal Credit claimthey turn down any job - evenit’s not in their area of expertise. Ministers said it would help move , people into work by June. But Joseph Rowntree Foundation director Katie Schmuecker said the policy “completely misses the point”. Anastasia Berry of the MS Society added: “Taking a forceful approach will not help everyone, especially disabled people, get into and remain in high quality and appropriate work. “Instead, it risks creating huge amounts of anxiety and stress – and could force people to do unsuitable, poorly paid and insecure jobs.” The DWP pledged the report after MPs said in : “At best, evidence on the effectiveness of sanctions is mixed, and at worst, it shows them to be counterproductive.” The National Audit Office also previously said the DWP was not following the effects of sanctions closely enough.  The DWP pledged to look at the effect of sanctions on “an inidual’s likelihood of entering work and on their earnings once they are in work”. A final report was pledged in late Spring . In June  officials said it was “a bit late” but still being worked on. A DWP spokesperson said: “With a record number of jobs available, it’s right that people who can work are encouraged to take up available roles. “Our new approach will help claimants get quickly back into work, while ensuring businesses get the people they and the economy need. “We know work is the best way for people to get on, to improve their lives and support their families because, as well as being good for mental wellbeing, people are at least £, better off in full-time work than on benefits. “As part of our new campaign, jobseekers will receive better, tailored support to get into work from our work coaches, and through jobcentres partnering with employers to match talent to vacancies.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Conservative PartyDepartment for Work and PensionsNational Audit OfficeThe economyDisabilityPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Yet we’ve just seen the Chancellor write off £.billion stolen from taxpayers by criminals who abused the furlough schemes. Lesson: don’t be exploited on the minimum wage by amoral firms kids, set up your own one. We tell those who want to become a senior public servant, such as an MP, that they must swear an oath to the Queen vowing “true allegiance” to herself and all her “heirs and successors, according to law”.Yet one of them, her second son, is Prince Andrew. The very sight of whom, I’m guessing, makes most young people want to swear in a dferent way.  Then there’s Robert Halfon, chair of the Commons Education Select Committee, claiming thatschoolkids want to succeed they need to follow the example of James Dyson. That’s the vacuum cleaner tycoon who ­championed Vote Leave due to the economic opportunities it would bring British industry before moving his global head office to Singapore. In other words, kids, talk the talk, then screw your country, andanyone complains, tell them to suck it up. But what must really puzzle them now is why they need to be truthful. We teach them that honesty is the best policy and cheats never prosper, yet the man elected to the top job in the country is acknowledged by even his closest colleagues to be a liar and a cheat. Treating the truth like a house guest with fleas hasn’t done the Prime Minister’s prospects any harm, has it  What must young people make of that  What must they make of Britain spending the last couple of months in political paralysis over Downing Street’s refusal to admit it was Party Central when their parents will soon struggle to heat the house and Russia threatens war  All because Boris Johnson lacked the moral decency to be honest when Partygate surfaced.  There would have been no need for a drawn-out Sue Gray report or the drip-drip of leaks about illegal drinks in Nothe people who made the rules we were all ordered to follow had owned up to breaking them and faced the consequences. And as Johnson looks to ride out whatever damning conclusions are in that report and carry on as though nothing happened, what does that tell young people on the cusp of adult le  Especially one who has a Tory MP, who, rather than call Johnson out for what he is, cheered him on as he brazened out his shame in the Commons. Or a Tory MP who waits to see how the report’s conclusions play with their constituents before calculating the best course for themselves. Then there’s the country’s top cop, whose skin has been repeatedly saved by the PM, refusing to investigate criminal allegations against him until a report about them is set to be released, then stepping in to effectively censor it. Our revised advice to kids should be that cheats do prosper and honesty’s not the best policy. Looking after No  is. But the next time you give a young person a lecture about decency don’t be surprised , like the people running the country, they laugh in your face.

Now, the Met Police has demanded Sue Gray delays releasing parts of her reportBoris Johnson after attending the weekly Prime Ministers Questions on Wednesday Image: Getty ImagesopinionByVoice of the Mirror:,  Jan Updated:,  Jan |commentsIn a healthy democracy the police should neither be beholden to politicians nor seek to do their bidding.The actions of the politan Police risk blurring these clear lines. It should have investigated the partying in Downing Street as soon as it was revealed by this paper. Now, after eventually deciding there was sufficient evidence to launch a criminal inquiry, The Met has demanded Sue Gray delays releasing parts of her report. Whether by accident or design, it has been a helpful ally of Boris Johnson who is playing for time in the hope the scandal will blow over. It may be in his interests to prolong matters but it is certainly not in the country’s. For as long as Partygate remains unresolved the Government is effectively paralysed. The quickest way out of this unsatisfactory situation would have been for him to resign. We don’t need an investigation to know he attended at least one party during lockdown or that his initial denials misled Parliament. A Prime Minister who is honourable and decent would have quit by now. But that is not Boris Johnson, who instead limps on as a discredited and diminished figure. What a choice Nobody should have to decide to heat or eat. But that is the choice facing an increasing number as living costs bite. Not everyone is struggling. The oil giants Shell and BP are set to record bumper profits. Shell rakes in more per hour than an average nurse earns in a year. While they laugh all the way to the bank, millions turn to foodbanks. Labour’s plan for a windfall tax on these firms would raise £.billion – enough to cut VAT on fuel and increase the warm homes discount. It speaks volumes that the Tories have rejected the proposal.

It appears the top civil servant will have to split her report in two - or delay it entirely - after the Met Police asked her to cut some references to gatherings it’s investigating. Ms Gray could decide as soon as today how to proceed with her report after the bombshell move.But either way, a late or half-baked report could fall short of the “killer blow” to Boris Johnson ’s authority that triggers a leadership challenge.And the PM clearly thinks heaposs in the clear for now - as Parliament is set to rise with no publication today, and heaposll spend the weekend kicking back at Chequers.Sir Keir Starmer said the government was “paralysed” by the chaos, which has come after days of briefing and counter-briefing about the report. Labour ’s leader said: “While the Tories are focused on this charade of Boris Johnson’s making, people around the country are worried about paying their bills, whether they can afford to fill up their car, and about the tax rises about to be imposed on them in a few weeks’ time.“They are getting no answers from a government mired in sleaze and scandal.” Scotland’s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: “This gets murkier by the minute.“Sue Gray and the Met are in dficult positions but the sequence of events and the situation arrived at now creates the suspicion - however unfairly - that the process of inquiry is aiding Johnson at the expense of public accountability.” Here’s what on earth is going on - and what might happen next.What is the Sue Gray report  Top civil servant Sue Gray is investigatinga string of parties between May  and April  - mostly in No and its garden.The -year-old took over the inquiry from Cabinet Secretary Simon Case after it emerged a party had been held in his own office. Her probe was set up to get “a general understanding of the nature of the gatherings”. That means saying who attended, the “setting and the purpose”, and “reference to adherence to the guidance in place at the time”. But she cannot rule whether the PM broke the lawor the Ministerial Code . And the names of junior staff are likely to be kept anonymous. Disciplinary action will be kept secret too. When is the Sue Gray report due - and why is it delayed Her report was due this week, with Boris Johnson promising to publish it within a short time of receiving it. But it was thrown into chaos after the Met Police began investigating “a number of” the Downing Street gatherings she’d looked at. Government and police officials are wrangling over what parts of the report could prejudice a police investigation. Sources claimed earlier this week that Scotland Yard had no objection to the report being published. But after days of confusion, the Met Police said: For the events the Met is investigating, we asked for minimal reference to be made in the Cabinet Office report.  The Met did not ask for any limitations on other events in the report, or for the report to be delayed, but we have had ongoing contact with the Cabinet Office, including on the content of the report, to avoid any prejudice to our investigation. This means the report now has to be either published with key details missing, or delayed entirely, or in full defying the police - a terrible choice for Ms Gray. As of lunchtime on Friday, Ms Gray was still in talks about whether and how she could release her report.Do the police have a good reason for this Scotland Yard’s decision prompted bafflement after the force spent weeks not investigating, only to launch one at the worst moment. Lawyers point out Sue Gray’s report is very unlikely to prejudice any court case, because lockdown breaches are almost always punished with on-the-spot fines.Nazir Afzal, a former chief Crown prosecutor for the North West, said onTwitter: This is absolute nonsense from the Met Police. A purely factual report by Sue Gray cannot possibly prejudice a police investigation. They just have to follow the evidence, of which the report will be a part.Top barrister Adam Wagner, who is an expert on Covid rules, tweeted: I am not a criminal lawyer so perhaps I am missing something.  How would a factual civil service report about events the police is investigating aposprejudiceapos their investigation  Former No aide Nick Timothy said it was “absurd to say that publishing Gray derails a police investigation prosecution. These are fixed penalty notice offences.”But others pointed out that Scotland Yard wants to “avoid any prejudice to ourinvestigation” - “investigation”, not prosecution.Nick Aldworth, a former Met chief superintendent, said knowing what’s in the report could “give the potential defendants an opportunity to conceal or alter evidence. Barrister Andrew Keogh tweeted: aposCriminal proceedings’ does not just mean a trial, so prejudice to them also means the investigation. Giving a potential suspect early sight of other evidence may for eg risk prejudice. We need to think wider on this one. Police slammed for not acting, now for doing it properly.Why is there so much confusion over the release date The Mirror understands confusion was worsened by an anonymous briefing from the Met. Police sources claimed on Tuesday that Scotland Yard had no objection to Sue Grayaposs report being published in full. But No later learned this was not, in fact the case. The opposite was actually true, and Scotland Yard still had questions over the report. Will the Sue Gray report be published in full No has repeatedly promised to publish the full findings of Sue Gray - in other words, the same report she hands to No. But the more relevant question is how much Sue Gray’s report will be “self-censored” before it gets to No. Even before the Met statement, the Mirror understood it would not contain all the evidence she received, only a summary, and could leave out inidual staff names. This meant it would not contain elements like text exchanges or photos of Boris Johnson with wine bottles. Now that the Met Police have intervened, whole parts of Sue Gray’s account - by definition the most damaging ones - could be left out too.Will this all help Boris Johnson Most observers think it will. The timing of the report is crucial for Boris Johnson because it affects his own MPs trying to topple him as Prime Minister.  Tory MPs need to send no confidence letters to trigger a leadership challenge, and many were waiting for the outcome of Sue Gray’s report before deciding. One Tory elected in  told the Mirror things had “quietened down in the past week”, adding: “Sometimes you get to the precipice, look over and go ‘aagh!’.” Pushing any conclusions into the long grass could allow the Prime Minister more time to “sort out” Downing Street and satisfy his MPs with a response. It could also ensure media coverage and public outrage over the scandal die down, meaning evendozens of people are fined, he survives politically. Meanwhile, publishing a half-baked report now will allow him to deflect and bluster, claiming he’s been exonerated by a half-report. There are no good options.Did Boris Johnson talk to the Met to ensure a ‘stitch-up’ Downing Street insisted it did not ask Sue Gray’s team to go back to the Met to ensure her report did not interfere with police investigations. A spokesman for Boris Johnson said: “It’s an independent investigation. we haven’t been privy to the details of that investigation or any of its content. “So that would be a matter for the investigations team and the Met.” AskedNo  had any conversations with the Met about the Gray report and what could be published, the spokesman said: “Not that I’m aware of, no.” Askedit was correct that the announcement from the Met – that they asked for the Gray report to make minimal reference to alleged events they are investigating – had no involvement from No , the spokesman said: “I believe that’s correct.” He added: “I’m not across the detail, it wouldn’t be appropriate for me to be so.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Downing Street party\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The row casts fresh doubt on the PMaposs integrity as he waits for the results of Sue Grayaposs report into Downing Street parties. Sir Philip, the Foreign Officeaposs permanent under-secretary, initially told the committee that Mr Casey had not received any correspondence about the PMaposs involvement.But leaked emails, published by the BBC, show Mr Casey asked an official to seek clear guidance for us from No  asap on what they would like us to do in the case.Sir Philip has now written to the committeeaposs chairman Tom Tugendhat to apologise for giving inadvertently inaccurate answers. But he said that on the day the email was sent, Nigel was almost entirely focused, in his role as Gold in our crisis response, on the terrorist threat to the evacuation. Labouraposs Chris Bryant, who sits on the committee, said: “The disaster of our withdrawal from Afghanistan requires the highest level of scrutiny. Parliament can only do thisthere is transparency from Government. “Since we published internal Foreign Office emails earlier this week, further emails have come to light that make it dficult to have confidence that we are getting full answers from the department.” The chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan last year is being scrutinised by the Foreign Affairs Committee amid ongoing questions about the Governmentaposs handling of the crisis.  Sir Philip was criticised when he admitted he had stayed on holiday for nearly two weeks after Kabul fell to the Taliban. The-then Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab also failed toimmediately from a family holiday in Crete. The evacuation of animals looked after by the Nowzad charity sparked a major controversy as thousands of people trying to flee the Taliban were left behind. Downing Street has repeatedly denied intervening to help Mr Farthing, who was able to evacuate  cats and dogs from the country using a plane funded by donations raised in a high profile campaign But an email shared with MPs by whistleblower Raphael Marshall showed a Foreign Office official saying that the Prime Minister had authorised the animalsapos rescue.And the BBC reported another email from the same day saying then-foreign secretary Dominic Raab was seeking a steer from No  on whether to call Nowzad staff forward.Another email from Mr Casey showed him asking a security official to seek clear guidance for us from No  asap on what they would like us to do.  The emails to the Commons inquiry were submitted by Mr Marshall, who worked for the Foreign Office at the time and alleges the animals were evacuated following an order from Mr Johnson.Commons Leader Jacob Rees-Mogg tried to downplay the dispute as fussing about a few animals.Downing Street sought to argue the officials in the first correspondence to be published may have been mistaken. The Prime Ministeraposs official spokesman said: Itaposs not uncommon in Whitehall for a decision to be interpreted or portrayed as coming directly from the Prime Minister even when thataposs not the case, and itaposs our understanding thataposs what happened in this instance. We appreciate it was a frenetic time for those officials dealing with this situation. Mr Farthing submitted a five-page statement defending his actions to the committee, saying the animals were transported in the hold of the plane which is not safe for humans. He said the charity had offered seats on the plane to British evacuees but their offer was turned down by the Government.

Conor Stapleton has the bizarre condition where his feet point almost perpendicular to the ground all the time.This leaves the -month-old unable to walk properly.Worried mum Jade Hatton first spotted the issue when Conor was around -weeks-old, Manchester Evening News reported.She said that she was told by health visitors to monitor his mobility on two occasions, but in the nearly two years since she claims his situation has only grown more dire and left him unable to walk or even put on shoes. Jade, from Hyde in Greater Manchester, said: “[Doctors] checked him when he was born, but didn’t say anything. But when he was -weeks-old, I could tell there was something wrong with his feet.  “I said to the health visitor that his feet were pointed, the visitor said he was fine. “When he got to about nine months, they were questioning me why he wasn’t trying to walk, or stand against things to bend down and pick things up. “I said it was because of his feet. They said ‘wait until he’s one’, then ‘wait until he’s  months’. Growing ever more worried, the -year-old mum took her son to the GP. They confirmed Conor was suffering from tight tendons, meaning he can only perch on his toes for a brief amount of time.  After already being referred to one hospital, the mum says she then had to aposwait months for an appointmentapos to see a specialist at a second hospital. She added: “Then in June last year, I went to the doctor again who said it was tight tendons, it took them ages to get me an appointment. “I went to Tameside Hospital, where the doctor said it was tight tendons, I then had to wait two, three months for an appointment at the Royal Manchester Childrenaposs Hospital. When Jade and Conor finally reached the doctor who would be putting casts on his feet in order to begin to correct his standing, the family were told he was apostoo ticklishapos, claims Jade.

Never miss a moment by signing up to our newsletter here.  Now, she says she has been referred back to Tameside, leaving her confused. Jade continued: “I went on January , took him in. The [doctor] sat down, she felt his feet and said ‘he’s too ticklish - to make my job easier, I’m not going to put his cast on today, I’m going to wait until he’s older and know why he’s having it done’. “Those were the doctor’s actual words. That appointment was specically for him to have his casts on because he can’t wear shoes, it’s a struggle putting his socks on. He can’t do anything at all. Not only are Conoraposs pointed feet giving him trouble learning to walk, there are other huge development impacts, adds the mum. “It’s made him extremely clingy to me, said Jade. Even when I take him to playgroups, he won’t go over to other children, and they won’t come over to him because he’s crawling. “So he can’t interact or play with them. “When he’s standing against the couch, he’s flopping back down and hurting his leg or banging his head. He’s learned to walk on his knees, and they’re getting bruised. “He just stays at home most of the time, playing with his cars or reading his books because that’s all he can do. “I wanted to take him to nursery, but he won’t be able to do things children his age do because they go out at playtime or go for walks in the woods. He would have to be in a pram. “And he’s getting that stressed and upset now because he can’t get about, he’s starting to have bad mood swings. “If he wants to climb on something and I don’t have the time to pick him up straight away, he’ll scream because he can’t get up on his own yet because of his feet.A complaint has been lodged with the NHS apos Patient Advice and Liaison Serviceby the mum, but she says she fears it could be aposyearsapos before Conor gets his casts - as delays to treatments across the health system continue in the wake of the pandemic. “I feel like screaming because I’ve been saying this since he was -weeks-old. I think people feel like it’s not a big deal because he’s not theirs, they don’t have to deal with him getting stressed and upset. “I rang PALS to complain and they came back to me saying they wanted a doctor to go over his feet again for the third time, she says. “The PALS staff member told me thatI didn’t hear back in a week, to let them know. It’s been about two-and-a-half weeks and I’ve heard nothing back. “It just feels like I’m not being listened to. He really needs casts to help him because his feet are so pointed. “My friend’s kids, who are even younger than him, who are walking, he can’t do anything like that. It puts a knot in my chest because he can’t walk, he can’t play. “I’ve been trying my hardest since he was -weeks-old and I don’t know what to do anymore, I’m stuck.  Adding to her anxiety, Jade is pregnant again and cannot continue to pick Conor up to carry him around like she used to. “I’m also  weeks pregnant, says Jade. I can’t keep carrying him aroundhe needs to go somewhere, itaposs putting pressure on my stomach and back lting him up. Iaposve had miscarriages in the past. But he canapost have a regular bed, he needs a cot that I have to lt him out of, because he could roll out and not be able to get back up. My partner works nights so itaposs usually me there. Heaposs like a baby thataposs as heavy as a toddler. I feel like Iaposm on my own. A spokesperson for Manchester University Foundation Trust, which runs the Royal Manchester Childrenaposs Hospital, said: “Conor’s mother has been in touch with our Patient Advice and Liaison Service and they’ll be discussing his referrals and treatment with her directly.” Tameside and Glossop Integrated Care NHS Foundation Trust Fountain declined to comment.

As the government relaxes “Plan B” restrictions in preparation to simply “live” with Covid rather than introduce more lockdowns, a study of , adults found  percent agree this is the best way forward. More than halfare happy “living with Covid”, with the average adult feeling this way for the last five months – despite soaring numbers over the winter, and the introduction of more restrictions in December. While more than seven in ten are “fed up” with the ever-changing rules and regulations, and would rather accept the virus as part of everyday le instead. And  percent are okay with the fact they might have to always wear masks in public places, while  percent no longer careit means booking holidays are now “complicated” and “uncertain”. Despite this, almost a quarterwould oppose the ideathe government confirmed this decision. A spokesman for lateral flow test provider, RapidTests, which commissioned the survey, said: “Itaposs understandable people have had enough of how weaposve been living for the past two years, and are keen to get back to “normal”.“Our research has shown how adults are prepared to accept Covid as part of their daily lives. “People are keen to enjoy making plans without the fear of last-minute cancellations and wasted money.” Workplaces, international and domestic travel, and live events are among the places people would most like to see restrictions come to an end – with nightclubs at the bottom of the list. Of those who are still working from home,  percent miss their usual place of work to some degree. And it’s reached such a point that half of those polled don’t remember a time before the pandemic, where mask-wearing or travel restrictions weren’t the norm. Nearly six in ten have even stopped booking holidays altogether, because it’s too stressful when worrying about delays or cancellations. And  percent have already experienced trips that have had to be postponed or changed. The research, conducted via OnePoll, also revealed just how many don’t feel Covid is as much of a threat – with more than a third of those who are fully vaccinated believing themselves to be “pretty much immune” to any serious symptoms of the virus. In fact, of those who know they have caught Covid at one stage or another, more than half said their symptoms were better than expected.The spokesman for RapidTests added: “It’s such a hard call to make as the vaccine has had a major impact on cases, but coronavirus does not seem to be going anywhere anytime soon.“It’s great that we have tests available to monitor the virus in hope that we can try and live as normal le as possible going forward.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON CoronavirusFace MasksCoronavirus vaccine\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus briefing with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

I was part of the Re:Act Disaster Response team who stepped up to help. The NHS was under the cosh at the time and I was part of the RE:ACT Disaster Response team who stepped up to help. I helped build the Nightingale hospitals in Wales and also worked with the local council in Hereford to distribute PPE. Now I’m at the pop-up vaccination centre in Hereford. There are two of us here who are ex-military – the other guy is an ex-submariner so we’ve got a broad range of skills. There’s not a lot that comes across our path that bamboozles us.The first time I volunteered was on a day off from work. We were tasked with letting people know about the vaccination centre, but of course we didn’t want to browbeat them so we let people come to us. Initially people thought we were giving out lateral flow tests – we’d say, No, we’re here for boosters or your first or second vaccination. It was quiet for the first hour, but word obviously spread around Hereford and by the end of the day I’d say we’d vaccinated about  people, from schoolkids upwards. I think . per cent of people were happy to have a vaccination. I thought: Evenyou get five people vaccinated, that’s five people who won’t suffer.” Yes, you might catch it, but you’re much less likely to end up in hospital. When people ask meI think it works, I feel like I can provide the back story for them.We’ve now even had people come in for their first jabs. I asked one, What changed your mind  He said,Omicron, because it’s more infectious’. I just said, “Well done.”So while I don’t strong-arm people, I do tell them, “I think you should get vaccinated. ‘We all need the booster so that le can get back to normal’  I joined the Royal Air Force in  and my last posting was out in Cyprus, but I always wanted to transition to a career in the NHS. Back in October  I joined the East of England Covid- mass vaccination programme and my first role was to provide support in the planning and delivery of large-scale centres, hospital hubs and community pharmacies. Now I’m working as the children’s project manager, leading and coordinating plans. This involves collating, analysing and improving plans, reporting to the programme director and the national team, using my past experiences to collaborate, advise and implement processes.  I’m good at seeing a problem and thinking outside the box to solve it. I can get parachuted into a project within the Covid- programme and am able to run with it. Every day is dferent, but that doesn’t faze me. I’m very adaptable and flexible – and I’ll give  per cent to achieving the common goal. Working with other people from the Forces means there’s a great sense of camaraderie. We share the same service ethos. If there’s a deadline, we’ll just knuckle down and get the job done. This is not a - job. Even though I might have to get up at .am to jump on a work call, I have no problem with that. I was motivated to join the Covid- programme by my sense of duty, and I’m really proud to be part of it. I have a passion for helping people and making sure things are completed to the highest standard. This gives me a real sense of achievement. I like being able to make a dference. The public response to getting boosted has been great, but there is still a long way to go. I believe the Get Boosted Now campaign is so important because we need to protect ourselves, the vulnerable and the future generations. We also need to get everyone boosted so we can get le back to normal as soon as possible. ‘One of my ex-soldiers gave me the Covid- jab’  I was  when I joined the Navy as a medic. It was the year after the Falklands War and I thought I’d like to get involved in something for the service of the country – to do what’s necessary when the time comes. As a Navy medic I was trained to deal with trauma from the very basic things up to the most drastic ones you could think of, like gunshots and traumatic amputations. After  years, I left in  to join the Army, then in  I moved to the NHS. During the pandemic I was initially asked to oversee the distribution of PPE. There were shortages across the board, and having worked overseas with the Royal Marines, my logistics knowledge came to the fore. I could make sure community midwives and health visitors had what they needed. In some cases this entailed doing the deliveries myself in the van!  For me, the pleasure in the role was being able to provide medical staff with the assurance that they would have the equipment they needed. I felt I was making a real dference. When the time came to get my Covid- jab, it was one of my former soldiers who gave me it. That was very impressive because when I met him he was , wide-eyed and fresh out of the box. When I next met him he was teaching the volunteers and St John’s Ambulance staff how to administer the vaccine. I was full of admiration for him. He’d stepped up as a young man and was teaching much more mature iniduals. But I wasn’t surprised – that’s what we expected our troops to do: step into the breach, wherever the breach happens to be. You can’t praise the veterans highly enough for getting involved in the vaccine campaign. They will serve their community in whatever circumstances, whether it’s dficult or easy. You’ve got a group of people who drop everything as soon as they’re asked, regardless of what their family commitment might be, and go and do the job. I don’t think there is a better resource for the country to draw upon.Follow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON British ArmyRoyal Air ForceNHSRoyal MarinesFalklands WarNigel JonesJake WadeHelen RobertsHospitalsSoldiersArmed forcesTeenagersThe FalklandsMost ReadRecommended"},{"url":null,"title":"dragons den reject secures double","story":"Dragons Den reject secures double investment after being turned downA Dragons Den candidate has told how he bounced back from rejection after his appearance promoting his non-alcoholic beer on the hit BBC show didnt go as plannedDragons Den reject Mark Wong says it was a great learning experience Image: Mark WongByRosaleen FentonDeputy Features Editor:,  Jan |commentsDragonaposs Den has helped launch some incredible businesses in recent years - but the show has also missed out on a few opportunities.

If you are sadly one of these people then fear not, because weaposve wrapped up some of the must-know information for visitors to the -year-old site, with the help of English Heritage.Barnard Castle history  The first stones are thought to have been put down on the site in  after the Norman Conquest of England. They were laid above the river Tees with the hope of controlling river crossings between the territories of two landowners. It is thought to have been built by the Picard knight Guy de Balliol who was succeeded by his son Berndard, who gave the castle its name. After his death in the mid-th century, the castle underwent ious improvements and developments until it was laid siege to in  by northern forces loyal to King Alexander II of Scotland. The siege was bloody but the defending Balliol family held off their advances, and the castle and those who lived in it entered into a period of prosperity.  From the early th century until the late th, the castle changed ownership multiple times with the comings and goings of ious lords, eventually falling into the hands of King Richard III. The king liked the castle and performed several repairs. He installed the still stunning projecting oriel window of the great chamber that overlooks the river and took great care of it until his death at the Battle of Bosworth in .

Its a very nice little town with lovely local shops  well worth a visit for an afternoon strolling around  shopping. Another, TeamWard, said: Barnard Castleaposs Castle is well worth a visit, the place would have looked mighty impressive + years ago with the sheer size of the area it covers, some excellent views of the river tees, plenty of ruins to explore and well supported by English Heritage and not Mr D M Cummings.  A third, called Steve-and-Andie, said: You donapost need your eyes tested to how lovely and peaceful this ruined castle is. Well maintained th century ruined castle with loads of information boards. Good views over the river Tees. Parking is a bit of a pain in town. Give yourself a good hour for your visit. Not everyone was so impressed though. User RchardN, said: We wanted to include Barnard Castle in our sight seeing tour. The signage for the castle is almost non existent until you are on top of it. Then there was just a very small sign no bigger than a street sign. To add to our frustration the doors were shut and it was closed. I checked the English Heritage website but there was no mention of closure. When is the best time to go to Barnard Castle  English Heritage says many of its sites can get particularly busy on bank holidays and between am and pm. Instead it suggests visiting outside of these hours for a quieter trip. For the best time to visit with virtually no one  there, you might want to consider going in the middle of a national lockdown.

And it is thought that Andrew’s older brother Prince Charles is among those concerned by the latest twist in his legal battle.The heir to the throne reportedly also played a major part in the decision to strip the Duke of York of his military titles and royal patronages earlier this month. Despite being brothers, the pair had very dferent upbringings and have also had very dferent adult lives. And it appears there have been several incidents - partly driven by Charles’ desire for a slimmed-down Monarchy - that have proved there has been tension between them… Dferent childhoods Charles is the eldest son of the Queen and the late Prince Philip with his birth coming in .Andrew was born in  - meaning there is an age gap of  years, so the pair didn’t really grow up together. But despite having the same parents, it seems that Charles and Andrew had very dferent experiences growing up.Experts believe the Queen has long felt the weight of raising Charles to be the next king - but with Andrew, she is said to have a far more hands-on relationship. Royal author Katie Nicholl told the documentary: There is a real tension between Charles and Andrew. Andrew has a very dferent relationship with his mother and the Queen was much more hands-on. Princess Dianaaposs former butler Paul Burrell added: Andrew has always been the Queenaposs favourite son and he has never done anything wrong in her eyes. While journalist Penny Junor said: I think the Queen has always had a bit of a blind spot when it comes to Prince Andrew. Close wives Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm. Click here to sign up.In the s, both Princes were granted grand weddings when they wed their respective ex-wives - Princess Diana and Sarah Ferguson. Diana and Sarah had a close bond and they were often pictured chatting at events, such as Ascot.They even took their children on skiing holidays together with Fergie frequently describing Diana as her best friend. This meant Charles and Andrew also spent a lot of time together, with royal expert Katie Nicholl noting the brothers had more companionship between them at that stage in their le than perhaps at any other. However, neither marriage lasted and both were orced by . Slimmed-down monarchy  As heir to the throne, Charles has spent his entire le preparing for the day he takes to the throne to become King.And it’s long been reported that he plans for a slimmed-down monarchy with a team of seven senior royals - that doesn’t include Prince Andrew or his daughters Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie.This came to a head in , when Beatrice and Eugenie were stripped of their -hour taxpayer-funded security.And one royal expert said Charles was forced to intervene in the debate about funding for Beatrice and Eugenieaposs security after it caused a row behind palace walls.It is thought the heir to the throne stepped in after the younger of his nieces racked up huge security costs as she travelled the world on her gap year. A report published at the time suggested Eugenie spent more than £, of taxpayersapos money as she explored India, America, Thailand and South Africa. Charles reportedly stepped in to control the spending, with royal author Angela Levin telling the programme Beatrice and Eugenie: Pampered Princesses  he suggested the sisters didnapost need costly security as itaposs unlikely they will ever become working royals.  But Charlesaposs suggestion didnapost go down well and is said to have left Andrew furious. Meanwhile another incident between the brothers also reportedly left Andrew angry. It came in  when the Queen was celebrating her Diamond Jubilee and an appearance by the royals on the Buckingham Palace balcony was planned.It was reported that Charles had a hand in the decision for only senior royals, such as the Duchess of Cornwall, Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge, to appear on the balcony - leaving Andrew dismayed. Royal expert Richard Kay wrote in the Daily Mail in : For Andrew, according to one close figure, being excluded from the balcony scene was a sudden and totally unexpected demotion from front-rank to peripheral royal. It was ‘like a dagger to his heart and he hasn’t got over it’.But this was a dramatic statement of intent by Charles, who long ago decided that when he is king the Royal Family would be ‘slimmed down’. But as a friend of the Duke of York says: ‘The speed and suddenness with which Charles has acted has taken Andrew’s breath away. It’s dreadfully high-handed.’ Public duties In , Andrew gave a famous car crash interview with BBC Newsnight and spoke atabout his association with billionaire paedophile Jeffrey Epstein.Andrew vehemently denied any accusations of wrongdoing over his links to Epstein, including allegations he had sex with Virginia Giuffre when she was  years old. In the days after the interview, his le began to change considerably and he stepped down from public duties. After the sad death of his father Prince Philip, Andrew talked to television crews outside All Saints Chapel, Windsor Lodge, to express the feelings of the Royal Family. He also very briefly appeared in a documentary about his fatheraposs le in September.However, it was reported in October that royal sources had claimed his siblings have ruled out anyback to public le for Andrew.An insider told the Sunday Times that a meeting was held last January where Charles - along with Princess Anne and Prince Edward were in agreement that their brother should never be allowed toto public le.Stripping titles  Last year, Virginia Giuffre began the process of suing Andrew in a civil case in New York for allegedly sexually assaulting her when she was a teenager.And earlier this month, a judge decided the Queenaposs son will have to face a civil trial. Andrew vehemently denies all allegations.Buckingham Palace then announced that Andrew would not undertake any public duties and that his military associations and royal patronages have been ed to the Queen. Charles is said to have had a hand in the decision to remove Andrew’s titles - along with his younger son William.And royal expert Robert Jobson said they had no other choice. He told the Mirror: “Prince Andrew will be devastated at the way he has been cut adrt by the royal family. But the Queen, Prince Charles and Prince William - the main players in this shocking move - will feel they had no choice.” After Buckingham Palaceaposs announcement, a reporter asked Charles a question about Andrew, but he didnapost answer. Proceeding to trialThe latest news in Andrew’s legal battle came earlier this week when his legal team filed documents in New York stating he “hereby demands a trial by jury on all causes of action asserted in the complaintHe also officially denied to the court a catalogue of sex abuse allegations brought by his accuser.  And now it’s been reported that Charles, as well as William, are aposshockedapos Andrew wants to fight his civil sex abuse case before a jury and are trying to persuade him to settle it quickly.A royal source claimed senior royals were shocked at his decision to have a jury trial and fear it could make things worse.They told The Sun: After the car crash of Newsnight no-one thinks a seven-hour deposition is a good idea - he were to appear in court it could be many times worse and senior royals were deeply shocked when they heard that he was demanding a jury trial.”Read MoreRead MoreFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Prince Andrew, Duke of YorkPrince Charles, Prince of WalesRoyal Family\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

He had recorded six videos of herKevin Syder admitted the charge Image: Hull liveByKelly-Ann MillsNews ReporterMark Naylor:,  Jan  A pervert brazenly filmed up a young womanaposs skirt as she stood in the queue to pay in Primark in what the court heard was crude, ugly, perverse, disgusting opportunist behaviour.The shocked -year-old was alerted to the degrading and embarrassing violation of her privacy by another shopper. She told Hull Crown Court the disgraceful and disrespectful filming had left long-lasting effects on her and it was one of the worst days of her le.Kevin Syder admitted recording images under the womanaposs clothes on March , , Hull Live reports.Richard Butters, prosecuting, said -year-old Syder from Hull was detained by security staff at the townaposs Primark in Princes Quay, after being alerted by a member of the public. The witness spotted him using a phone to take photographs up the skirt of a woman standing in front of him in the queue.  The shopper told the woman: Excuse me, I have just seen this man taking a photograph up your skirt. The woman was with her younger sister at the time. There were six videos showing the womanaposs bottom and underwear that had been filmed by Syder. He attempted to run out of the store but he was fortunately detained very quickly by security staff, said Mr Butters. He was arrested and his phone was seized. It has had a very long lasting, profound impact on his victim. The woman later said she felt myself freeze. I felt shocked. It was extremely upsetting and shocking and I was crying, she added. I donapost even recall what I was saying. I was so shocked about what had happened. I canapost remember exactly what I was shouting. I should be able to wear whatever I wish to and not have anybody taking a photographic image up my skirt. She told the court she felt violated, adding: I feel really numb and upset. The woman said that she would have to carry the incident around with her and she would be on edge the next time she went into town, especially to Primark. This crime has left long-lasting effects on myself and my family. I think about what happened to me every day, she said. Itaposs not just the physical act of what happened but the emotional trauma from a day that stays with you. I went through one of the worst things to happen. Itaposs degrading and embarrassing. I find myself reminded of what happened. I threw away any skirt or dress that came even slightly above the knee because I genuinely felt I didnapost have the confidence to wear them. I could barely concentrate on the work I had to do. That day was one of the worst days of my le. Julia Baggs, mitigating, said Syder wanted to apologise to the victim. This was clearly an impulsive and opportunist act, said Miss Baggs. This behaviour was completely irrational. He didnapost stop and think about the impact on the complainant. He does understand the seriousness of the offence and the damage that he has caused. He is deeply remorseful and sorry for his actions. He does feel deep shame and regret and this disgraceful and disrespectful act, to use his words. He is deeply sorry for this degrading and disgraceful piece of behaviour. Syder had no previous convictions and had worked as a plasterer before becoming a long-distance lorry driver for  years, a job which he lost because of this offence. He had served in the Territorial Army for more than  years, the court heard. He had been married but has no children. Judge Michael Fanning told Syder: Itaposs upskirting. Itaposs a crude, ugly word and it describes crude, ugly, perverse, disgusting conduct. I am well aware that the impact on victims is very, very real. He told him the woman was entitled to wear her own choice of clothes and to expect that some pervert is not going to stick a camera under her skirt for his own sexual gratication. She should not have to feel degraded, humiliated and violated, said Judge Fanning. This was very much targeted offending. You saw an opportunity. You saw and seized that opportunity. You recorded that victim under her clothing and that was for your sexual gratication. The real risk was that you shared it. Fortunately, you were caught on the day, the video was seized and that brings it to an end. Syder was given an -week suspended prison sentence, with rehabilitation work, and he was ordered to pay £ compensation to the woman. He must register as a sex offender for seven years and the phone will be forfeited and destroyed.

So it’s likely the family will gather on the balcony to wave to royal fans in June during the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee celebrations.However, one member of the family who won’t be making a balcony appearance is Prince Andrew.Earlier this month, a statement from Buckingham Palace confirmed the Duke of York would no longer be taking part in any public duties.It comes as he faces a civil trial in New York following sex abuse allegations made against him. He vehemently denies the claims.  However, it won’t be the first time that Andrew has not been present during a royal balcony appearance. In , the Queen was celebrating her Diamond Jubilee of  years on the throne - and an appearance by the royals on the Buckingham Palace balcony was planned.It was reported that Charles had a hand in the decision for only senior royals, such as the Duchess of Cornwall, Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge, to appear on the balcony - leaving Andrew dismayed.Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm. Click here to sign up.Royal expert Richard Kay wrote in the Daily Mail in : For Andrew, according to one close figure, being excluded from the balcony scene was a sudden and totally unexpected demotion from front-rank to peripheral royal. It was ‘like a dagger to his heart and he hasn’t got over it’.But this was a dramatic statement of intent by Charles, who long ago decided that when he is king the Royal Family would be ‘slimmed down’. But as a friend of the Duke of York says: ‘The speed and suddenness with which Charles has acted has taken Andrew’s breath away. It’s dreadfully high-handed.’ As heir to the throne, Charles has spent his entire le preparing for the day he takes to the throne to become King. And it’s long been reported that he plans for a slimmed-down monarchy with a team of seven senior royals - that doesn’t include Prince Andrew or his daughtersapos Beatrice and Eugenie. Meanwhile, it has been reported today senior royals led by Charles and Prince William are aposshockedapos Andrew wants to fight his civil sex abuse case before a jury and are trying to persuade him to settle it quickly.The Duke of York has always denied accusations of rape and sexual assault made by his accuser Virginia Giuffre, who was this month handed the right to take the Queen’s son to trial in the United States. In his first official response to the court regarding claims made against him last August, the Queen’s son issued  straight denials of Ms Gufre’s allegations.  A royal source toldThe Sun:After the car crash of Newsnight no-one thinks a seven-hour deposition is a good idea - he were to appear in court it could be many times worse and senior royals were deeply shocked when they heard that he was demanding a jury trial.The best outcome for everyone is that this is settled as soon as possible. There are deep, deep worries that this will get worse and worse for the family and will overshadow Platinum Jubilee celebrations.

Former royal protection officer Paul Page said the Queen aposs second son was scruffy and wearing a tracksuit when he was spotted outside the Queenaposs bedroom and he was thought to have been an intruder.He claims the Prince then threw a tantrum and swore at the officers who were trying to protect the palace. Mr Page said he was in a control room checking CCTV when they spotted a man walking alone along the Queenaposs corridor, so he went along with a sergeant and two others officers to investigate.Her Majesty was not at Buckingham Palace at the time, so this was a major potential security scare. We approached from either end of the corridor so we could surround the potential intruder, he told The Sun.He added that they soon realised it was a scruffy looking Prince Andrew wearing a tracksuit. I apologised and said, aposIaposm sorry, your Highness, we went to investigate a possible intruder in Her Majestyaposs apartmentsapos. Andrew replies, aposThis is my house, I go where I want, now f*** offapos. Mr Page, who has spoken out about his time as a royal protection officer before added that he thought Prince Andrew was a bully. I never had any problems with any other members of the Royal Family in my time at Buckingham Palace. The Queen is a lovely lady, but Prince Andrew had this nasty side to him, he treated staff terribly, he said. Speaking to the Mirror, Mr Page, who worked in the Royal Protection Command from  until , alleges he personally made three separate complaints to palace officials about the prince. He claims he is aware of “at least a dozen” other reports made by colleagues. Mr Page, whose revelations this week sparked a string of complaints about the prince, said: “Buckingham Palace launched a bullying investigation against Meghan last year after she was accused of wrongdoing. “If it’s a fair organisation that looks after its staff, an investigation should be started to confirm whether or not Andrew is guilty of being a bully and of intimidating staff.”  He alleges complaints he raised during his service were ignored because senior courtiers did not want to create a stir. Mr Page told the Sunday Mirror: “The Palace have a problem because there are instances and evidence of Prince Andrew being overbearing and verbally abusive.” In  Mr Page lost his job after he was jailed following a £ million property scam. He set up a sham company, tricking colleagues, friends and family into parting with their cash, savings and pension payouts. The judge said the scheme was “breathtakingly dishonest, relentless and callous”.  The former Buckingham Palace royal protection officer ed to public eye when he appeared in the ITV documentary, Ghislaine, Prince Andrew and the Paedophile, during which he described the access Ghislaine Maxwell had to the palace.He told the documentary Andrew would “shout and scream”his collection of toy bears on his bed were not placed in exact positions by maids. That prompted the prince’s former maid Charlotte Briggs, , to come forward with allegations. She accused Andrew, then in his s, of foul-mouthed rants and ludicrous demands. They included making her run up four flights of stairs to close his curtains while, she says, he was right next to them.

She also told of being in tears and of hiding to avoid the “bad-tempered” and “entitled” royal. Diplomat Simon Wilson, who hosted the duke in Bahrain, previously claimed the “rude” and “boorish” prince had “childish obsessions” and was nicknamed HBH by staff – for His Buffoon Highness. Former maid Janette McGowan, , claimed she had to check a Polaroid of  teddy bears on Andrew’s bed and lay them out in exact positions to avoid him becoming angry. Mr Page claimed there “must have been at least a dozen complaints” about bullying in the time he was there.  He alleged: “It was well known in the palace, but no investigation was conducted by the royal household.” Mr Page claimed a colleague had been called a “fat lardy-a***d c***” by the prince after stopping a woman at the gates who had not been listed as an invited guest. He said: “Even the woman went bright red and said, ‘I’m really sorry’. Another time a woman got locked in and he came down f-ing and blinding and ranting.” Andrew,  – ninth in line to the throne – is facing calls to be evicted from -room Royal Lodge after being told to stop using his HRH title and stripped of his military titles and charitable affiliations. He is fighting sex assault claims in the US in a civil suit by Virginia Giuffre, the alleged sex slave of his former pal Jeffrey Epstein. He vehemently denies the claims.

Charles has been heir to the throne for much of his le and has constantly been preparing for the day he finally becomes monarch.However, he will only become King once his beloved mother the Queen sadly passes away. And according to royal biographer Penny Junor, it will be a terrying prospect for the Prince of Wales. Speaking on Podcast Royal, she said: “This is a moment that he has been dreading all his le really because his achieving the top job, the job he’s been training for and preparing for all these years does inevitably mean the death of his mother and he loves his mother very dearly.  “So it’s going to be a very vicious week, moment and I think that I am sure that he is pretty terried of the whole prospect. He is a very emotional man and a sensitive man, he did take the death of his father very badly. He takes the death of any loved one to heart and I think it would be, it’s devastating for him as it is for anyone who loses a much-loved mother.” Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm.

Royal author Angela Levin told talkRADIO : Prince Charles has wanted for a very long time to cut the monarchy down to save costs and to make people be worth the money that they got from the taxpayer.I think the outer edge of the family, which the Queen has wanted to keep together for a very long time for sentimental reasons, which at her age she didnapost really particularly want change which I think is understandable.

But each bottle will set you back an eye-watering £ - compared to Sainsburyaposs own brand, which sets you back just p. The sauce, which is flavoured with dates, apple juice and spices, comes in a glass jar with a Royal Estate label. It states on the bottle: A real family favourite, packed full of tomato and lightly spiced, this ketchup is delightful. Vibrant and fruity, this ketchup can be enjoyed any time of the day, perfect to add flavour to a dish.  The Queen is also selling a brown sauce for the same price, with the description: a tomato based sauced packed with vinegar and spices. The Monarch is said to be a fan of the sauces but doesnapost use the condiments on a regular basis. The Queenaposs former chef Darren McGrady said in  that kitchen staff would make their own versions of takeaway favourites for the royal family. However, they never eat fast food - so you wonapost catch royal hands around a Big Mac any time soon. He explained: It always tickled me at Balmoral, we would make our own burgers. They would shoot deer, and we would do venison burgers. Thereaposd be gorgeous cranberry and everything stuffed into them, but we never set buns out. He went on to say: Her Majestyaposs Victorian upbringing dictates that the only thing you would pick up and eat with your fingers is afternoon tea. They would have burgers, but not the buns. So they would eat it with their kne and fork.

He also said HM hates pizza and during his time in her service, not a single one was ever served. But she doesnapost tell anyone what her favourite food is - and for a very good reason. The Queen has attended banquets around the world and tried a number of dferent cuisines, but when it comes to her favourite food, sheaposs been keeping the exact dish under wraps for years. But a royal insider has explained how she doesnapost ulge her favourite food before travelling, so that she isnapost served the same thing everywhere she goes.

She was so incensed she had to later send out a message confirming ‘Clive is alive’.I’m not surprised she was furious. THIRTY POUNDS  I’d want a whole sheep and a field of turnips for that. Now I love a roast dinner more than most. Just thinking about tender meat soaking up gravy makes me drool. But come on, prices are getting ridiculous.I was going to wax lyrical about how mutton can taste just as delicious, and how scrag ends of meat in a stew contains the same goodness. I was tempted to suggest putting lesser cuts of meat in a big pie to make a substantial meal for half the price.  But then I stopped myself and thought: why, decades after our parents had rations, are we having to think this way  Why are we putting up with outrageous price rises on essentials  Why are honest, hardworking people punished in the pocket and at the dinner table  My dad always said, whenever the budget announcements were made, working people were hit hardest with the increased price of a pint and packet of cigarettes. Now it’s food. Thinking about it left me angrier than Clive’s we. Bittersweet time for Her Majesty Staying at Wood Farm cottage at Sandringham in the run up to the th anniversary of her father’s death next weekend will be extra emotional for the Queen as it’s the first time she’s been there without Prince Philip. I imagine it will feel comforting one moment, heartbreaking the next. The rooms, the gardens, the views and even the smells will remind her of the good times she’s had there, but the people she shared them with are gone. Loch Lomond is the special place where Colin and I enjoyed our special times. Each year I’d askhe’d like to have a holiday in Portugal or Loch Lomond, and he always chose Scotland. We loved everything about our trips there, from the long drive with our Motown music, Scotch eggs and tin of travel sweets. We’d always stop at Tebay services which has beautul scenery, turkey pie to die for and a farm shop.  We stayed in a cosy lodge, where even a cup of tea or a Chinese takeaway seemed to taste nicer. We’d walk in the wilderness for miles, spotting red deer, and we’d end up at little tea shops where it would have been rude not to order cake. Sometimes we’d drive to explore the surrounding areas and we’d get lost, in the days before sat nav, but somehow always found a warm, friendly pub. Colin loved the gentle pace and peace of our holidays there. And I adored how everything about the place made us both feel so relaxed and happy. I get a little tearful when Loch Lomond appears on television. Then I remind myself I was lucky to have had such fantastic times there.  Bloominapos solo birthday While Boris had a party for his birthday, I spent mine alone. My two sons bought me flowers and left them at the end of the drive because we wouldn’t have dreamt of breaking the social distance laws. I am too tired to be angry. Listening to all the political rows has left me weary and drained. Instead, I just wish all sides of the political spectrum would get their heads together and get our country up and running again.  Drama a real blast It can be hard to stay awake in January when it’s a long, grey, damp anticlimax. But an explosion scene in the new TV series Trigger Point made me jump out of my skin. My eyes popped so wide I felt more awake than I had in weeks.  Loo are you talking to  Fancy new research says lots of British phrases are no longer used because the younger generation are baffled by them. What a load of codswallop. Whoever did the survey needs to listen to my daily chat with my friend Beryl because we use such phrases constantly. I say this as a woman who still calls those sweets Opal Fruits and will never say Starburst. So here’s my guide to those sayings which have got young people’s knickers in a twist. Flogging a dead horse means there’s no point in arguing any more - that’s what I say whenever I’m giving our Robert a talking-to because he never he pays any notice. I’m fit for the knacker’s yard means every bit of me is falling to pieces and no use to anyone, which is how I describe myself these days.  Dropping a clanger is a less posh way of saying committing a faux pas - something my friends say I do every day. No wonder no one understands that ‘spend a penny’ means going to the loo because they usually cost a pound now. And a dog’s dinner is what I create each time I try cooking. But I have no idea where ‘daft as a brush’ comes from - or why my friends use it whenever they talk about me. Bobsleigh, the coolest sport The Australian Open tennis has turned my body clock upside down because I’m glued to the coverage. Soon I’ll be riveted by the Beijing Olympic Winter Games. The bobsleigh is my favourite. Me and my friend Janet reckonwe could get in one we’d shoot down faster than anyone . But we’d laugh so hysterically there’d need to be room in my skin-tight race suit for a Tena Lady.If you’d like to write to Val, please email features@mirror or write to Val Savage, PO Box , E DD The Mirror makes a donation to the Alzheimer’s Society in lieu of payment. alzheimersRead MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Novak DjokovicPrince Philip, Duke of EdinburghRobbie SavageAustralian OpenWinter Olympic GamesRoyal FamilyMental healthPrice risesAlzheimers diseaseBobsledDaily Mirror\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Ulidia Integrated College in Co Antrim, Northern Ireland, has defended its strict toilet policy where the loos operate as a one-in one-out policy at break and lunchtimes.Requests to use the loo during class time will be refused unless the pupil shows a medical card or exemption to the teacher, parents were informed via email.Furthermore, pupils who need to use the toilet outside the specied times during their period will need a note from their parents, which will then be dated and counter-signed by their form teacher, BelfastLive reports.  The school said it has been dealing with ious issues amongst an increasing number of Year  pupils, which included disrespecting staff, misuse of toilets, unorm breaches, Covid- breaches, and vandalism. The school has said that from January  it was implementing a zero-tolerance approach.One parent Ciaran McCauley told BBC Radio Ulsteraposs Evening Extra on Thursday: My son is in Year  at the school and he came home on Friday last and was quite concerned because he had become aware of the email that had gone out to the parents of Year  students.It doesnapost affect my son directly but he was able to empathise with the issues that might be impacting the other students.  He complained that the toilets were being locked and students and parents had been asked to supply notes. If the children needed to access toiletsthey were on their period, they had to bring a note in, have it counter-signed by a teacher and dated. Ciaran believes itaposs an unfair policy and wrong. He added: I thought it was regressive and led to embarrassing situations for kids. Unfortunately, we live in a society where periods still have a stigma attached to them and theyaposre still an embarrassment for many.  Ciaran initially thought the email was a rumour, but when he contacted the school they confirmed it. In a statement, principal Michael Houston said: As a rights respecting school, Ulidia Integrated College is in full support of the Period Dignity Project, which refers to the accessibility and availability of essential care needed to support a period in conjunction with the removal and breaking of stigma and taboo around periods. Education is a key factor in breaking the stigma surrounding periods and promoting respect, understanding and open discussions about what people may experience. Following repeated incidents of vandalism and breaches of Covid- safeguards in the toilets, many of which occurred during lesson times, some facilities had to be closed, replaced or repaired. We want to ensure that all pupils in the particular year group affected are always given access to clean and sanitary facilities during their period. Mr Houston added that the measures are temporary and protective, only relevant for the pupils in a single year group who have to leave during lessons as facilities are freely available before school, at break and lunch time, end of day and between lessons as required. He added: In addition all single person all access toilets are open too all pupils all day every day without exception. It comes two months after a Co Down grammar school was criticised for its toilet policy after it emerged there were just three toilets for , pupils.The rules about going to the toilet imposed at Glenlola Collegiate School in Bangor were labelled “draconian”.Thehas contacted the school for a comment.

The Grade ll Listed baronial gothic manor house oozes elegance with castle turrets on the roof and its sweeping staircase in the hall. The th century property boasts a library, outdoor swimming pool, tennis courts, a gym and cellars. The bedrooms include one with a four poster bed. But itaposs not until prospective buyers walk through the picturesque walled garden that the real treat is revealed.  A Hobbit Hole - like that inhabited by Bilbo and Froddo Baggins in the fantasy books and Hollywood blockbusters - is hidden in the woodland. The tiny, green painted shed even comes with a trademark circular door. But the magic doesnapost end there, there is also a stunning tree house - complete with lighting and a fireplace.  The elf-like wooden hut is built up in the branches and access is gained via two rope bridges. The house in St. Margarets-at-Clfe, Dover, Kent is on the market for £.million with Sothebyaposs International Realty. The Rightmove listing reads: Oxney Court is an elegant Grade ll baronial gothic manor house located on the Kent coast. It has extensive grounds and formal gardens together with further accommodation in two cottages.  It is situated in a most secluded and discrete setting, accessed by a long private drive. Oxney Court has an interesting history. Whilst there has been a house on this site for a few hundred years the current house dates from the late th century.  Substantial gates open to a driveway which passes through ancient woodland before continuing through more formal gardens on approaching the house. A striking entrance porch leads to an octagonal reception hall with stone flooring.  Moving through, the staircase hall has a stone fireplace and a sweeping staircase leading to the first floor landing. Beyond, the elegant principal reception rooms stretch across the front of the house. The main accommodation is provided over three floors. The ground floor accommodation consists of a fine, generously proportioned dining room which is in the gothic style. There is a large bow window with detailing and a high ceiling with ornate mouldings. The drawing room has a striking mirrored wall and a double sided fireplace to the end of the room which also opens into the library with fitted bookshelves.  Beyond is the triple aspect sitting room which, like the dining room, has gothic detail. Together these rooms provide a wonderful space for both family living and formal entertaining. A spacious corridor leads to a double aspect study, led with oak and on to the kitchen breakfast room. The kitchen is fitted with handmade oak units arranged around an island unit and is naturally illuminated by a large roof light.  An elegant hexagonal conservatory is set to the southern corner of the house and views of the garden to the rear. The first floor consists of elegant and spacious bedroom suites. The master bedroom is of good proportions having a bow window with easterly views and double doors to a well appointed bathroom. This can also be approached from the tower staircase. From here, double doors overlook the turreted porch below. The family bathroom is situated to the rear of the first floor. Across the front of the house are three well-appointed suites, the largest enjoying a triple aspect. A fth bedroom is found at the rear, adjacent to which is a large rooftop balcony with a southerly aspect.  There are cellars and store rooms beneath the main house. But then the Lord of the Rings surprise is revealed as it adds: The gardens and grounds are laid to areas of lawn interspersed with laurels and rhododendrons and surrounded by deep belts of trees and woodland.The lawns are underplanted with a great iety of flowering bulbs, shrubs and other plants and the more formal garden to the rear of the house has deep herbaceous borders enclosed by yew hedging and high brick walls.There is a further area of garden, mostly laid to lawn, as well as a rose garden which is enclosed by box hedging, and an arbour. In the woods there is a magnicent tree house with rope bridges and a hobbit house.

The report is expected to be sent to No in the coming hours or days after Ms Gray handed over evidence of possible lockdown breaches to Scotland Yard.No will then decide when to publish it, with the government previously suggesting this would happen when Parliament is sitting - which is next on Monday.  However, the report is set to follow the Met Police request to include only “minimal reference” to Downing Street parties the force is investigating. It is unclearor when a fuller report with all the details will be published, after the Met finishes its investigation. The politan Police asked the top civil servant to make minimal references to the parties it is investigating in her report to avoid prejudicing its inquiry. Scotland Yard is looking at a number of events in Downing Street and Whitehall during the pandemic - but the force has not specied which ones.Reports have suggested it could be as many as eight gatherings. At the same time, Sue Grayaposs report had been expected this week but the timing has been thrown into chaos by the Metaposs bombshell announcement of a police probe on Tuesday. The Whitehall inquiry is understood to be still ongoing but Ms Gray may be forced to decide whether to delay her report or strip out key details. Opposition MPs blasted the appearance of an establishment stitch-up and a Whitehall whitewash, which could buy Boris Johnson a reprieve.The Prime Minister will spend the weekend at his Chequers retreat as he seeks to shore up his battered leadership. In a statement on Friday, Scotland Yard said: For the events the Met is investigating, we asked for minimal reference to be made in the Cabinet Office report. The Met did not ask for any limitations on other events in the report, or for the report to be delayed, but we have had ongoing contact with the Cabinet Office, including on the content of the report, to avoid any prejudice to our investigation. However some legal figures questioned why publishing the Whitehall report would prejudice the police investigation.

I was like aposOh my God, that is the most thoughtful gt anyone had ever given me. The fact that his voice is in a teddy, itaposs just so pure and I can hug it and listen to it when Iaposm sad so I think I was just happy, If Iaposm sad, I can just talk to it because itaposs got his voice. Itaposs not him, but itaposs him to me. The feeling to know that the teddy is in my room just made me feel happy. He was such a genuine person and he would literally light up a room as soon as he walked in. There was no bad energy, he was just positive vibes, and he was always thereyou needed him. He was just like the best person ever. The thoughtful gt was a Christmas present from her younger sister Maddie. Rodneyaposs body was repatriated to Zimbabwe ahead of his funeral in September . His brother filmed proceedings and sent it to Taylor so she could watch. Taylor added: I was a mess for ages, I still am to be fair. I would just think of him for a day and Iaposll just start crying as the emotions just wouldnapost stop. I just broke down, I couldnapost breathe. I [was thinking] aposThis isnapost true, he was one of the best people in the world, why has he been taken so soon apos I made myself believe that it wasnapost real. The feeling was just so heavy on your chest, itaposs like aposNo way this is real, Iaposm dreaming.apos I just couldnapost stop crying.” Footage of Taylor using the bear went viral on TikTok.

Nicknamed ‘stealth Omicron’, it appears to be more contagious than the original, and is spreading faster than the original iant.What are the symptoms of Omicron  Omicron is a iant of Covid, which means the classic symptoms are a new, continuous cough, a fever and a loss of smell taste, according to the NHS.However, scientists behind the ZOE Covid symptom app have revealed people testing positive for Omicron are logging symptoms more closely associated with the common cold. The top five symptoms found in in positive cases are:Runny nose Headache FatigueSneezingSore throat However, there are two lesser known symptoms that it is important to be aware of – back pain and dizziness. Dr Ann Mary, Consultant, General Medicine, Amrita Hospital, Kochi, told IANS: “Back pain, though common in most viral fevers, but compared to Delta, Omicron patients tend to have more back pain and less loss of smell and taste. “A signicant number of these patients are having back-breaking pain in the lower back and severe myalgia which is adding to the patientaposs woes.” Brits will be well aware of the three main symptoms of coronavirus – a new, continuous cough, a fever and a loss of taste and or smell. These are the officially recognised symptoms according to the NHS. However, with the new Omicron iant, symptoms have been described as being more similar to a common cold. Itaposs important to be aware of the symptoms in order to limit the spread of Covid. most common symptoms of Omicron, overtaking the  aposclassicapos Covid symptoms Is a rash a symptom of Omicron  Is altered taste a symptom of Omicron  Warning in your eyes doctor warns could be sign of Omicron Warning signs that the Omicron symptoms youaposre experiencing arenapost mind Omicron symptoms parents may be able to spot in children  least pleasant Omicron symptom – including dizziness  The NHS also reports that dizziness can be a sign of Covid, although it’s perhaps a lesser known symptom. They describe the dizziness as a “sensation of spinning or an altered sense of motion often called vertigo” and “lightheadedness”. The NHS notes that this can occur “during the acute phase of the infection, during recovery or as part of Long Covid symptoms.” What to doyou think you have Covid If you have any of these symptoms, especially the three aposclassicapos symptoms, you should book a free PCR test, and self isolate until you have the result.

Impressive footage shows Leo carrying a miniature first aid box in his mouth before laying it gently next to a prone mannequin. Emily then says aposnoseapos prompting the two-year-old to put his own head to the dummyaposs lips and check whether itaposs aposbreathingapos. Leo then jumps off his front paws and onto the dollaposs chest five times before going back to their nose and then repeating the routine a second time.Emily, from Aberdeen, said: Leo learnt CPR as part of a task called paw tricks for the International Trick Dog Competition. He has won the Champions League six times in a row.For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. He jumps up and down when I say aposupapos and checks for the breathing when I say aposnoseapos. I taught him to check for breath using a target stick on the mouth of the dummy until he learnt where he needed to keep his nose. Leo weighs kg which is a bit too heavy to have him jumping on me. Every day he totally amazes me. Heaposs a real dog in a million, Iaposll never have another Leo. Leo constantly surprises Emily at how quickly he learns tricks, and even some she doesnapost even think are possible, he masters in just  minutes. Iaposve been training him ever since I brought him home at eight weeks, she said. I already had his half-sister Phoebe so I actually met him when he was three days old.  The footage of Leo performing the CPR has been viewed more than , times on social media and has received thousands of comments from people who were stunned by how clever he is. One person said: So clever. My spaniel would be running off with the first aid kit refusing to let go. Another wrote: That would definitely bring me round. Dogs are so much cleverer than us. A third commented: OMG. You training him to do this is nothing short of a miracle. Emily teaches Leo a new trick every week and builds them up methodically by making them slightly more dficult.  Emily said: For stacking the rings I started by teaching him to hold objects in his mouth, then dropping them into a washing basket. Gradually his target became smaller and eventually I got him to drop the rings onto the stack while I was holding it. It took about a month in total from start to end. Some of them are using similar skills but using them on dferent objects. Leo is so incredibly happy when heaposs training. Heaposll fall asleep watching TV afterwards but ends up waking himself up by wagging his tail so much. Phoebe will do tricks for treats but she isnapost as keen to do the brain games as much, she prefers weaving through targets. Emily ramped up Leoaposs training after he almost died in March  when he contracted a parasite called giardia. Emily said: I thought he was just sleeping under my desk one afternoon at work but when it came for me to leave, he just didnapost stand up. Leo had gone into shock so I rushed him into the emergency vet. They thought it was Lyme disease initially but a few days later it came back as giardia. The Mirror is committed to more hopeful news.

It was a horrible few days. Incredibly he recovered physically after only a few days but it really affected him mentally and made him very anxious. We started to get back to normal and then we went into lockdown. So from nowhere, we were at home all of the time and he was just really sad. He wasnapost like the happy dog he was before and I knew I had to do something to help him out of his slump. I knew heaposd always enjoyed his training so I decided to focus on doing a bit more of that with him and thataposs how the tricks started.Have you got a story to share We want to hear all about it.

Kris Tierney was bought the gt by her daughter Jamie Nowacki, , a teacher from Ohio, to mark her first anniversary without late husband Tim. Tim would always give his we flowers, so Jamie also followed suit and took a bouquet to her house to mark their th wedding anniversary. She gave her a teddy bear which has a sound box placed inside, so that when pressed it plays an audio recording of Tim saying, love you. The audio recording is from a voicemail which they cut down to use as a shorter soundbite. Kris couldn’t believe it when she heard her late husband’s voice once again, and said she will cherish the bear for a long time. Jamie said: “It was my parentsapos wedding anniversary and the first without my dad, so I knew I needed to find something very special to give her. “My dad always gave my mom flowers so I knew we had to take some over to her. He passed away unexpectedly from a fall. “What made the bear even more special was that my mum always called him her Timmy Bear and he signed every letter and card he gave her with aposTimmy Bear’, thataposs why I knew it had to be a bear. It started way back before they even got married.  “She didn’t realise what the bear did until we told her to push its paw. Once she heard his voice she lost it. “I knew it was just what she needed to hear, his voice saying ‘love you’. It made her day, even though it was such a hard day. “It was a dficult day for her and she said that she felt happy, sad and thankful all at once.” Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON LoveMarriageBears\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Daniel and Lacey Rawlings were given  months of supervised probation without jail time in their sentencing on Thursday. In a Colorado court, Judge Timothy Wright sentenced Daniel to  months of probation and , hours of community service, while Lacey received  months of supervised probation and  hours of community service.The horror incident happened on November  of , after a period of heavy rain in the area north of Phoenix,People reported.The Bar X Crossing at Tonto Creek had flooded and authorities had placed a barricade to turn vehicles away from the area. Daniel was driving the military-style vehicle, with seven children in the back.  Authorities alleged that he drove the vehicle around the barricade and through the creek - a journey he had made several times earlier that day. However, this time the vehicle was swept up in the rushing water. The parents and four of the children were rescued by helicopter, but the three other children did not survive. The bodies of the coupleaposs -year-old son, Colby, and the boyaposs cousin, -year-old Austin, were recovered the following morning, while the body of Colby’s sister, -year-old Willa, was found two weeks later on the edge of the lake, several miles away. Both Daniel and Lacey were each initially charged with seven counts of child abuse.  Daniel, who was behind the wheel of the vehicle, was also charged with three counts of involuntary manslaughter. In December, Daniel entered a guilty plea to three counts of manslaughter and seven counts of child abuse. Meanwhile, Lacey pleaded guilty to one count of child abuse. Speaking in court on Thursday afternoon, Lacey described the incident as a “mistake [she agonizes] over every minute”.  “I will continue to agonize over it for the rest of my le, she said. Iaposm so sorry. Lacey went on to describe her surviving children as being her “world”. My kids are the reason I get out of bed every single day. My kids are the reason I found a way to move on. They deserve a happy le. They deserve a mother who tries her absolute hardest to give them everything they need. Daniel took the stand next to read a prepared statement.  I wish every day that I could go back and relive and redo the events of that horric day, he said. I wish I could take that trauma and carry it myself. I wish I could take everybodyaposs pain and bottle it up and hold it myself because nobody deserves to endure pain that I have caused them. While many family members spoke on the couple’s behalf, at least one relative urged the judge not to be too lenient. Austin’s grandmother, Lynn Morey, told the judge she still has nightmares about the incident. Cutting corners when it comes to childrenaposs safety is a deal-breaker,” she said. Thanksgiving has never been the same since. That feeling of dread lingers throughout the weekend, overshadowing everything our family does, despite our attempts to live through this, be grateful and move on. The coupleaposs probation begins immediately.

No matter how hard you try, those whites always end up looking grey. However, one TikTok trend doing the rounds on social media promises to have your whites looking bright, and the best bit is, itaposll only set you back a few pence. The hack was shared by one user, @burcibaci, who revealed the one simple and cheap item you need to add to your wash to ensure those whites stay white - washing up liquid.  For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. All you need to do is add a small amount of washing up liquid to a small cap, before throwing it in the washer with your white load, although the TikToker recommends you do this in addition to your washing detergent, rather than in its place. aposaposI would also add your detergent too for the best clean, she wrote alongside the clip, which has since been viewed more than , times. Although she used a pale coloured Fairy Liquid, other TikTok users recommended blue soaps as they can be used to cancel out the yellow tones in the white materials. Many people questioned how the bubbles from the soap didnapost overflow, but @burcibaci simply explained that you only have to use a very small amount for it to be effective. It also makes a great stain remover! One part dawn dish soap, one part hydrogen peroxide, one helpful TikToker commented.

One woman has gone viral online after sharing the jaw-dropping tale of how she was catfished by her manager at work, of all people.

She gave her aposhisapos number and the pair began texting and arranged a date - only for Olivia to be stood up.And when they planned a second date, she was stood up again as he claimed he was stuck in meetings. A third date was planned and the guy said he came to the bar, didnapost see Olivia and left - then tried to come back to find her and his train got stuck underground. At this point, Olivia had enough and told her manager she didnapost think things were going to work out between her and the male friend.  A few months later at Christmas, the mysterious guy sent her a text again asking for one more chance and having nothing better to do Olivia agreed. However, she was once again stood up at dinner as this time the guy claimed heaposd been in a car accident. Bewildered, Olivia finally started to connect the dots. Did you also start putting the pieces together, like maybe it was your manager the whole time and maybe you found out she had a burner phone and used some random gayaposs photos who lives in Georgia, she explains. She also sent flowers to your house pretending they were from the guy and when you fact-checked the handwriting on the note with the flowers, her handwriting and his handwriting were exactly the same.  In a follow-up video, Olivia adds that she reported the incident to HR and her boss was fired. She also found out this wasnapost the first time the manager had done something like this, sheaposd also done the same thing to a woman at a previous company sheaposd worked at. Olivia believes her manager had been struggling with her sexuality and might have had a crush on her. Thousands of people commented on TikTok, with many stunned by the story. One person wrote: What the F**K. Another said: Sprinting to HR. A third asked: What in the letime move is this ! Someone  added: NO STOP.

Speaking honestly to her subscribers, she admitted ‘people-pleasing’ when it came to choosing what to call her two sons and daughter. She eventually chose Frederick David for her first son, Finn Barnaby Boo for her middle child and Evelina Blossom for her youngest. I always loved floral names, she said. My husband hated all flower names, he wanted a stronger, more classic girl name and that they are not to be taken seriously. I really disagree and feel I should have been a bit firmer. Sarah-Jayne, known as SJ to fans, said her other choices for Evelina had been Marlowe, Florence, Juniper and Bronte.  What do you think of the names  Have your say in the comment section below.She continued: We wanted to be a bit safe in our choices and that’s something that I regret, I think I went way too safe, I think I just went too middle road and I should have pushed the boat out a lot more. She also admitted that there had been a particular boysapos name that sheaposd always loved. SJ explained: The number one name I really regret because I didn’t give it enough of a chance was the name Atticus. It’s a people pleaser thing when you pick names because you worry about what other people will think of it. If I went back I think I would be a lot braver because I definitely regret not sticking to my convictions and listening to other people. Don’t pick the one you think everyone  is going to like - pick the one you think is a bit more unique and special and you will love. This isnapost the first time the mum-of-three has made headlines. In , SJ made the news after she broadcast her labour of Eveline to , people online. She currently boasts K subscribers on her popular YouTube channel, where she posts content about parenthood. In a video welcoming newcomers to the channel, the influencer says: I started YouTube because motherhood and parenting is literally the best thing Iaposve ever been lucky enough to do. I wanted to capture it. I wanted to literally capture every single second I could. I know for an absolute fact that one day when Iaposm older, Iaposll sit and watch hours and hours of these videos and Iaposll definitely cry, Iaposll hopefully laugh, and I know Iaposll just wish to go back to their childhood just for one single day, and I hope through this that I kind of can.Did you pick an unique name for your little one  Email yourmirror@trinitymirror.Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON PregnancyParenting\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\" to FREE email alerts with news to brighten your daySubscribeInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The mum-of-two had originally agreed to attend the event, which was set to take place in June, but the bride has since decided to have a destination wedding in Spain. The price of the trip, including travel and children, has meant sheaposs unable to afford the Liverpool hen do.The the bridesmaid organising the celebration and several other attendees were angry with the mum as they would have to absorb her costs, reports Liverpool Echo. The woman took to Mumsnetaposs popular Am I Being Unreasonable [AIBU] forum for advice - but tricked users in a bid to get honest answers.Posting a reverse, she told the story from the perspective of the bridesmaid who was tasked with arranging the getaway. Iaposm organising a hen do for later in the year for my friend who Iaposm bridesmaid for. She is getting married in Spain, she wrote.  Iaposve booked a hen do in Liverpool for  weeks before the wedding which is costing £ each and we were all paying for the bride within that cost. One of my friends who was attending the hen and the wedding has text[ed] over the weekend saying she canapost afford to do both and is therefore pulling out of the hen do so she can still go to the wedding. The thing is she had told us she was coming so now it means that we are short for the activities we had planned and either have to now do less than we have told everyone, or ask the bride to pay for herself. She said we can keep the £ deposit she paid. AIBU [am I being unreasonable] to think that sheaposs being a bit selfish, as she already committed to coming  Hundreds of users weighed in, with % of them voting it was unreasonable for the bridesmaid to call the mum selfish for pulling out. She then revealed she was actually the friend who has cancelled and that her posed had been a aposreverseapos. Justying the move, she added: Confession... this is a reverse. I didnapost want to pull the aposwoe is meapos card and have people vote in sympathy. Everything  is totally true. Have you had a wedding drama  Email yourmirror@trinitymirror.I knew the cost at the start, they were very honest and I felt that it was a lot but still agreed and instantly regretted it. I didnapost know at the time that flights to Spain would cost as much as they have, plus I have  young dc [dear children] and when we go to the wedding we are having to put them in a holiday club at the cost of £ a day between them as family who have them for the  days in August that fall on working days work full time. I canapost afford it but have been made to feel so guilty these last  days by the bridesmaid and others going, I feel like the s****est friend in the world. Iaposve not spoken to the bride yet as she knows nothing and I donapost want to drop anyone in, it or upset her. What a mess. Fellow Mumsnet users rushed to support the woman, with one commenting: I canapost abide this extravaganza that weddings have become. Itaposs about the marriage! Another added: If theyaposre so keen to have you there, OP, they can stump up the cash for it! Maybe bride can pay for herself and reduce the cost for everyone ! Responding to the comments, the mum said: Thanks. Sorry for the reverse as well... I know theyaposre flipping annoying... But as I was writing my OP [original post] out it felt very much like I was trying to sway the vote with pity. Itaposs no excuse though.Do you think she was right or wrong  Have your say in the comment section below.Something has happened financially to us this past  weeks which is why my circumstances have changed so much. A few of the group do know about this Iaposve not hidden it, but itaposs meant the hen do which felt very expensive before is just no longer affordable unless I take out a credit card and thataposs something I really want to avoid, or by the time I get back Iaposll be paying it off in the run up to Xmas which means it will just be ongoing.

The three-bed property in Middlesbrough is set to go under the hammer next month. The tiny price tag could also fetch you a Prada Ostrich leather bag or a pre-owned Ford Fiesta, which sell for around the same amount. The property, which is located on Finsbury Street in the Northeast town, boasts three spacious double bedrooms and a bath and shower room. It also features a family-sized living room, and a kitchen leading out onto the garden. One of the bedrooms even has space for an office desk in the corner as well as a double wardrobe, making working from home a real possibility for potential homeowners. With nearby Middlesbrough, Thornaby, and Marton railway lines all within three miles of the property, the house is well-connected to transport links.Fancy living here  Have your say in the comment section below.  But the residential area is also ideal for beach walks, with Finsbury Street roughly a -minute drive to the nearby coastline. Royal Estates, the company that manages the property, describes it as: A three bedroom terraced house located in a quiet residential area. The property briefly compromises of: entrance hallway, through lounge, kitchen leading into rear garden, three bedrooms, family bathroom and a turfed rear garden. The impossibly small price tag pales in comparison to average UK house prices, and is much more affordable than other homes in the area. The average price of terraced houses sold in Middlesbrough last year was £,, while houses on the same street came in at an average of £,. A house in London, however, would set you back an average of £K, according to Zoopla, while the national norm is £K.

Despite having numerous clothes airers, she couldnapost find space to hang all of her clothes to dry. But one day while she was putting her bedding out to dry, the -year-old had a eureka moment. As she covered the clothes horse with the bedsheet, placing it near the radiator, she found that the sheet had created a pocket of hot air, drying the clothes underneath within just two hours. For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. It was kind of a eureka moment,” Alix, a postwoman, said. I was trying to find where  to hang the bed sheet to dry, apart from over the kitchen door which ends up smelling of whatever you’re cooking. I usually keep my clothes frame by the radiator, especially in winter and I just thought aposwhy not throw the bedsheet over the frame, tuck the ends behind the radiator and under the stands then the hot air from the radiator will dry my clothes in hours.apos I stay in a small, cosy, one bed flat with my partner and we always have two clothes frames at once as we have busy lestyles and go through a lot of washings which takes up too much space.  We have a tumble dryer but to be honest, it costs far too much and doesn’t really leave your clothes smelling the best. I think the reason this hack would benefit people is it saves money on tumble drying. You probably have the heating on anyway as it’s January. It saves up space as your clothes would be dry within hours and the clothes horse can be packed away again and into the cupboard. Instead of the usual  hours and your clothes are still damp – then low and behold, it’s time for another washing! It doesn’t have to be a never-ending cycle anymore.Alix shared the incredible results on Facebook, where her post racked up more than , likes.Thousands of users took to the comments section to share their own experiences and tips. One person said: Done this for years it’s actually brilliant all my clothes dry so quick! Another wrote: Definitely giving this a go, takes about three days to dry an airer full of washing. A third commented: Well this looks like a bloody game changer! Someone  said: “Omg why haven’t I saw this before, constantly wondering how to dry washing faster with all radiators being full, dryer full and clothes horse full. [sic] Alix also shared a few top tips to maximise results. She said: People askdampness occurs, but I use a double bed sheet over a king sheet so it’s not totally covering the whole clothes frame and there’s still gaps for the air to escape and heat the room up – win win! If you’re worried about damp, crack a window slightly or have a dehumidier nearby. People have also askedthis can cause fires but I don’t think a radiator is hot enough,you’re that worried just turn it down on a low heat for longer and keep an eye on it. I’ve found on a medium-high setting, they were dry within - hours and - on low give or take. My clothes also still smell fresh of the fabric conditioner because they dried so quick.Have you got a story to share We want to hear all about it.

Zuzana James, , a flight attendant from Bedford, wanted to give her kitchen some much needed TLC. But knowing that her friends had been quoted £, to have professionals fit their kitchen, which is a similar size to hers, she decided to attempt to do the work herself. In just five days while in self-isolation, she spent £ on supplies from BQ, eBay and Etsy, turning her dreams of having a Pinterest-perfect cream shaker kitchen into a reality.Zuzana told LatestDeals : The idea was in my head for a while.I always look for ways to improve our home and follow a lot of home accounts on social media. For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. I saw other people completely transforming their kitchens with a lick of paint, but I never really had the time to give it a go. Then I tested positive for Covid just after New Year and had no symptoms, so I took my self-isolation as the perfect opportunity to crack on.” Zuzana used bargains from BQ, eBay and Etsy to complete her kitchen transformation. She continued: I got everything I needed from BQother than the door handles. I used click and collect and sent my husband to collect as I obviously couldn’t leave the house. I spent about £ on the supplies, which included primer, cabinet paint, topcoat, frog tape, sugar soap, a couple of sanding blocks and some brushes and foam rollers. I started by scrubbing all the surfaces with sugar soap to get rid of any dirt and grease. I then took the doors off the hinges and took the handles off. All the cabinets got a light sanding with a sanding block before I started with the primer. For priming I used the Bullseye primer and did two coats, lightly sanding in between coats.  Then I used V cabinet paint in Soft Grey and also did two coats. I then finished off with two coats of sheer satin topcoat.” Believe it or not, the kitchen handles were the biggest cost for Zuzana. She explained: The handles ended up being the biggest cost of this transformation. I tried to do it cheaply and ordered cup handles and knobs from Amazon, but ended up sending them straight back because they were super flimsy and cheap looking. You do get what you pay for!So I had to bite the bullet and spend £ on door handles. The cup ones are from eBay and the knobs are from Etsy. But they just make such a dference!For the tiles, I just used the same primer, some white tile paint I already had at home and the same topcoat.  Instead of getting a whole new worktop, Zuzana decided to wrap it using DC Fix Oak Effect, also from BQ. She purchased three rolls, which were £ each. She added: I used the leftover wrap to wrap a couple of shelves and created a display cabinet for my little Starbucks mug collection. Wrapping the worktop was the trickiest job, so I’d recommend getting a second person to help hold it all in place. But it is doable - I managed on my own. This brought the complete cost to about £ - and it was worth every penny!” Zuzana has some advice for people who are looking to transform their space but aren’t sure where to start. She said: The advice I would give people is to go for it - but onlyyou have at least four or five days of time on your hands, as it’s not a job for one afternoon. Personally it took me five days to do everything, but it obviously depends on the size of the kitchen and how many hours you put in each day.  The feeling after it was all done was just priceless though!” Zuzana is thrilled with the savings she has made and is seriously impressed with how her new kitchen looks. She added: The response I had after posting this on my social media was also overwhelming and few people suggested I start a home page myself.So I’m giving it a go on Instagram @living_on_lovelland I’ll be sharing a step by step of how I did everything.It looks even better than I imagined and it gives me a surge of pure happiness and feeling of accomplishment every time I walk into the kitchen, which is all the time now! Our friends are having a new kitchen done which is a similar size to ours and they got quoted £,, sowe would have got it professionally changed, I’m guessing it would cost somewhere in that region. I feel pretty smug knowing how much we’ve saved, and since I haven’t got thousands to spend, it was the only way I could have a nicer kitchen! Tom Church, co-founder of LatestDeals, says: Shaker kitchens are all the rage at the moment, but they can cost a fortune to install new - as Zuzana says, quotes can be £k and even more. But Zuzana has proved that we can all get the look for less by doing it ourselves! Her kitchen looks truly sensational, so much so that it’s hard to believe it cost just £! Using DC Fix, painting supplies and investing in some gorgeous handles, Zuzana has given us all a masterclass in bringing Pinterest-worthy spaces to our homes for a seriously wallet-friendly price.Have you got a story to share We want to hear all about it.

A video by Space Transportation shows animated passengers boarding a plane attached to a wing powered by rockets. Once safely seated, the vehicle stands vertically and takes off. Once in the air the plane detaches and shoots off into space on its suborbital journey - in the example to Dubai -before landing vertically on three legs which detract from its rear. Its ultrasonic speeds means passengers could travel between London and New York in around an hour. Ground tests by the company, full name Beijing Lingkong Tianxing Technology Co, are expected as early as next year, with a first flight in . A test flight for its space vehicle is expected as soon as .  A spokesman for the company said: What we are developing is a rocket with wings, which realises high-speed point-to-point transportation. “We are developing a winged rocket for high-speed, point-to-point transportation, which is lower in cost than rockets that carry satellites and faster than traditional aircraft.” A number of Test flights of the firm’s Tianxing  and Tianxing  vehicles have been held recently. Details on the prices people can expect for suborbital travel are currently unknown. Last year Sir Richard Branson’s Virgin Galactic passenger rocket plane soared more than  miles in its first fully crewed test flight to the edge of space. Touted as the precursor to a new era of space tourism, the company is said to be poised to begin commercial operations this year, with several hundred bookings already. Tickets cost around £, each. Sir Richard said last year: “Iaposve wanted to go to space since I was a kid, and I want to enable hopefully hundreds of thousands of other people over the next  years to be able to go to space. And why shouldnapost they go to space  Space is extraordinary the Universe is magnicent. “I want people to be able to look back at our beautul Earth and come home and work very hard to try to do magic to look after it.

One of the dolphins was a seven-year-old pregnant female. Dolphins usually live to be around . The most recent porpoise corpse was found on the beach of La Araña and had no obvious signs of injury or disease. The centre for the recovery of endangered marine speciesis hoping an autopsy can shed some light on the situation.  The tests that have already been carried out on other dead dolphins have not yet given conclusive results. Six years ago, a virus wreaked havoc among these marine mammals in other parts of the Mediterranean coast and in a previous wave around . Some experts fear that the increase of naval military manoeuvres in the face of the crisis in Ukraine and the sonar on these ships and submarines may be causing the dolphins to confuse their routes and end up on land. And other experts are pointing to the strong and persistent storms as the main cause of the mysterious tragedy. They say dolphins need to get their heads out of the water to breathe, andthey are exhausted or sick and use their mouth to breathe, then they may struggle to fight the waves and seek the shore to help them breathe, where most end up dying.

She added that some head teachers would also be expected to retire within the transition period.#Job sizing will be criticalthe proposals are to be implemented,# Ms Connor said.Council documents explain that the process of job sizing takes into account the size of schools, leadership roles and teaching time when deciding on the salary scale for promoted posts in education.#Head teachers retiring would also form part of the modelling,# Ms Connor added. #If a school collective was agreed where there were, for example, seven head teachers then two might be retiring and that would form part of the model.#Until collectives are looked at in more detail we can#t have a clear idea of staff numbers.#As part of the consultation process, which started in November and is due to finish on March , the council has shared its proposals with parent groups and community councils.Feedback from the consultation is timetabled to be presented to Argyll and Bute Council in April.This will be followed by the proposals being voted on towards the end of  and,approved, interim processes to bring in the changes would begin in spring .At Tuesday#s meeting it was explained, however, that the consultation will continue throughout the process with pupils, parents and educators being included in the process throughout.In addition, dialogue is continuing with the Roman Catholic Diocese of Argyll and the Isles concerning the involvement of faith schools in school collectives.These discussions were described by council officers as #ongoing# and #collaborative#.Concerns were also raised about the timing of the proposed changes, coming when pupils# education and wellbeing had been impacted by the pandemic.Acting Head of Education Learning and Teaching Wendy Brownlie said: #Young people#s views have been gathered throughout and they have expressed really interesting points both for and against the changes.#The consultation paper addresses the issue of the pandemic by saying: #The last couple of years have been extraordinarily challenging for schools.

honour the traditional Scots dish with a rendition of one of Robert Burns’ most famous and oft-performed poems: Address To a Haggis.Usually recited by the dinners host, the tongue-in-cheek address has been a long-established focal point of the Burns Supper, a night which celebrates the birth date of the literary legend himself: January , .After the haggis is piped to the table , Burns’ words are recited over the dish as it is cut open and served to the guests.Some say it is wise to cut a small incision in the side of the haggis before it is properly \"cut open\" on the table - tales of guests being scalded by flying contents during enthusiastic recitals have been told.Others say this is part of the fun.What is the history of an Address to a Haggis The address was composed in the year  - not long after the poet arrived in Scotland’s capital city. There are two stories linked to the poem’s inception - one more romantic than the other.The first version alleges he’d been invited for dinner at the house of a merchant friend, Andrew Bruce, and composed the poem to amuse the wealthy host and his guests.The second, and slightly more charming version, is that he composed the poem off-the-cuff whilst visiting the house of his cabinetmaker friend, John Morrison, in a fit of inspiration brought on by the sight of the luxurious meat pudding.In the th century, haggis would not be a meal enjoyed very often – reserved as an item of extravagance and occasion. Based on Burns’ political persuasion, it’s been speculated that his tribute was ironic in its praise – poking fun at the upper classes who might revere it as an item of luxury.Though the true origin of the poem is debated, it was one of Burns’ first poems to be published in the Edinburgh periodical, The Caledonian Mercury, on December , ..removeA quick video search for an “Address to the Haggis” brings up hundreds of results, ranging from a “Haggis Address for Kids”, recitals at kitchen tables and in dingy restaurants - to a piper in full dress, piping the dish into the National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh.  High-society lestyle magazine Tatler recently published an article titled “Where to head for the finest Burns Night supper in London” - it’s clear that the Address to the Haggis can and should be performed in places both high and low. As thousands of Addresses to the Haggis continue to be made the world over, it’s inevitable that each one will have a character of its own - something the Bard himself would surely have approved of. Address to a Haggis by Robert Burns, in FullFair fa your honest, sonsie face, Great chieftain o the pudding-race! Aboon them a ye tak your place, Painch, tripe, or thairm : Weel are ye wordy oa grace As langs my arm. The groaning trencher there ye fill, Your hurdies like a distant hill, Your pin wad help to mend a mill In time oneed, While thro your pores the dews distil Like amber bead. His kne see rustic Labourdight, An cut you up wi ready sleight, Trenching your gushing entrails bright, Like ony ditch And then, O what a glorious sight, Warm-reekin, rich! Then, horn for horn, they stretch an strive: Deil tak the hindmost! on they drive, Till a their weel-swalld kytes belyve Are bent like drums Then auld Guidman, maist like to rive, Bethankit! hums. Is there that owre his French ragout Or olio that wad staw a sow, Or fricassee wad make her spew Wi perfect sconner, Looks down wi sneering, scornfu view On sic a dinner  Poor devil! see him owre his trash, As feckless as witherd rash, His spindle shank, a guid whip-lash His nieve a nit Thro bloody flood or field to dash, O how unfit! But mark the Rustic, haggis-fed, The trembling earth resounds his tread. Clap in his walie nieve a blade, Hell mak it whissle An legs an arms, an heads will sned, Like taps o thrissle. Ye Powrs, wha mak mankind your care, And dish them out their bill o fare, Auld Scotland wants nae skinking ware That jaups in luggies But,ye wish her gratefu prayer Gie her a haggis! "},{"url":null,"title":"covid-scotland-nicola-sturgeon-say-today-face-masks-working-home","story":"First Minister Nicola Sturgeonhas given give her weekly Covid update in parliament today.The final restrictions that were put in place in response to the Omicron iantwere removed on Monday, January .In an update last week the First Minister announced that nightclubs would be able to reopen, and caps on indoor events and table service requirements where alcohol is served would be removed.These measures were put in place in December, alongside a maximum capacity of  people for outdoor events.

deaths of people who have tested positiveThere were  people in intensive care on Monday, January  with recently confirmed COVID- and , people were in hospital yesterday with recently confirmed

safety due to not being widely promoted, campaigners have warned.Charity Cycling UK said that a “long-term and well-funded communications campaign” is needed to make people aware of the update.The Highway Code, which contains advice and rules for people on Britain’s roads, is being amended this weekend to introduce a risk-based hierarchy of road users.New Highway Code rules  – test your knowledgeNew Highway Code rules – what you need to knowHere’s everything you need to know about what’s new as the rules of the roads receive an update.Hierarchy of road usersA new hierarchy means people in charge of vehicles that can cause the most harm in the event of a collision have the greatest responsibility to look out for other road users.Walking, cycling or riding in shared spacesCyclists should not overtake people walking or riding a horse in shared spaces closely or at high speed, while pedestrians should take care not to obstruct paths.Positioning of cyclistsCyclists should make themselves as visible as possible by riding in the centre of lanes on quiet roads, in slower-moving traffic and at the approach to junctions.Pedestrians crossing at junctionsTurning traffic should give way when people are crossing or waiting to cross at junctions.Traffic must give way to people on zebra crossings.Overtaking cyclistsDrivers travelling at speeds of up to mph should leave at least . metres when overtaking cyclists.They should give more space when overtaking at higher speeds.Opening car doorsCar occupants should open doors using their hand on the opposite side to the door, making them turn their head to look over their shoulder..removeThis technique, known as the Dutch Reach, reduces the chances of doors being opened into the path of cyclists and motorcyclists.Overtaking cyclists at junctionsWhen cyclists are going straight ahead at a junction, they have priority over traffic waiting to turn into or out of a side road, unless road signs or markings indicate otherwise.Cycling in groupsPeople cycling can ride two abreast but should be considerate of the needs of other road users when in groups.RoundaboutsDrivers should take extra care when entering roundabouts to make sure they do not cut across cyclists.Electric vehicle chargingElectric car owners using a public chargepoint should park near the device and avoid creating a trip

We face a constant battle against time and the elements.”HES admitted it remained a massive challenge to save the historic sites.“We are taking proactive action now to assess the nature and scale of the immediate challenge and to explore a range of solutions and options,” Dr Mitchell said.“It is inevitable our approach to protecting historic buildings will have to change we need to reimagine how we manage these historic and much-loved places.”Paul McLennan, MSP for East Lothian, said: “I’m disappointed to see the sites in East Lothian closed for a period of time but understand the reason why.“The closure of the sites, along with the cancellation of the airshow, will have an impact on the tourism industry in East Lothian.“I will be undertaking a tour of East Lothians tourist attractions in the next few months to see what support I can bring to them.”Martin Whitfield, MSP for South Scotland, added: “Clearly, it’s disappointing that these important local sites look set to be closed or subject to restricted access for some time.“They are important contributors to our local heritage, tourism and the economy, attracting thousands of visitors each year. However, the safety of staff and the public must be the priority and closures are understandableremedial works have to be completed to make the buildings safe.“That said, nobody will want to see these sites closed to the public any longer than absolutely necessary.“Therefore,it’s determined that additional resources are required to complete the work, I’ll be calling for the Scottish Government to step in and provide more funding.”Local businesses have also been affected due to the closures, with guests being left disappointed to find the sites closed or choosing not to visit at all.Christopher Hansen, co-owner of The Open Arms Hotel in Dirleton, said: “We do have a lot of people askthe castle is open I’m not sure it’s put people off coming to stay but sometimes people aren’t aware that it’s closed.“I don’t think it’s had an impact on losing business but certainly caused people disappointment.“You’ve got to take health and safety seriously but they should have been making sure that properties were of a safe upkeep that they could be used.”"},{"url":null,"title":"recycling-changes-made-east-lothian-industry-leader-producing-clean-material","story":"The local authority introduced a sixth waste receptacle to households late last year as it looked to improve kerbside collections.And at a meeting of the council’s cabinet on Wednesday, its head of infrastructure Tom Reid hailed the new service as a success.He told the cabinet that although figures were still not available to compare the impact of the additional collection, the council was producing “industry-leading” material.He said: “While other local authorities are having to pay to have recycling waste separated, we are not.”The council introduced white weighted bags to homes for them to “wash and squash” plastic bottles, tins and cartons into as it increased collections in November.The bags join a food waste caddy, green household waste bin, brown garden waste bin, a blue box for paper and card, and a green or black box for glass bottles and jars.Mr Reid acknowledged that some teething problems had been encountered when the new bags were first introduced, along with new weekly collections, due to the impacts of Brexit and Covid.However, he said that they had quickly resolved issues and the service was now working well, although he said figures for the new recycling service would be unlikely to be available until the end of the financial year.The East Lothian system sees vehicles, adapted to empty the dferent receptacles into separate compartments, introduced to allow more regular kerbside collection and cutting the separation work needed once the rubbish is taken back to centres.Most other local authorities collect dferent recycling materials in one wheelie bin or similar receptacle, leading to more separating work being needed and risking the materials, which can be sold to private firms, being less “clean”.Mr Reid’s comments were made as part of an annual report into the council’s ongoing climate change strategy.It set out a number of key achievements in its annual review, including successfully claiming £.m of Scottish Government funding for energy efficiency schemes, including installing wall insulation and air source heat pumps in areas of fuel poverty and upgrading  central heating systems.A vehicle to grid trial, which sees energy from an electric car battery pushed back into the National Grid when not being used, is also under way at the council’s Penston House base, as well as the installation of  new electric vehicle chargers, taking the number publicly available in the county up to .Councillor Norman Hampshire, council leader, said that the report showed the work which was being done to meet climate targets in East Lothian.He said: “This annual update provides a clear indication of East Lothian Council’s progress as an organisation and employer to reduce its carbon footprint and also identies actions and achievements within our local communities.”"},{"url":null,"title":"adventure-cinema-open-air-tour-coming-edinburgh--films-can-watch","story":"The tour, which launches in April, will have showings of films such as Steven Spielbergs adaptation of West Side Story, musicals Mamma Mia!, Bohemian Rhapsody and classics like Dirty Dancing.These screenings give people the chance to watch cinema in the open air and under the stars in places like National Trust sites, medieval castles or country estates.HUGE NEWS!

address has been a long-established focal point of the Burns Supper, a night which celebrates the birth date of the literary legend himself: January , .After the haggis is piped to the table , Burns’ words are recited over the dish as it is cut open and served to the guests.Some say it is wise to cut a small incision in the side of the haggis before it is properly \"cut open\" on the table - tales of guests being scalded by flying contents during enthusiastic recitals have been told.Others say this is part of the fun.The address was composed in the year  - not long after the poet arrived in Scotland’s capital city. There are two stories linked to the poem’s inception - one more romantic than the other.The first version alleges he’d been invited for dinner at the house of a merchant friend, Andrew Bruce, and composed the poem to amuse the wealthy host and his guests.The second, and slightly more charming version, is that he composed the poem off-the-cuff whilst visiting the house of his cabinetmaker friend, John Morrison, in a fit of inspiration brought on by the sight of the luxurious meat pudding.In the th century, haggis would not be a meal enjoyed very often – reserved as an item of extravagance and occasion. Based on Burns’ political persuasion, it’s been speculated that his tribute was ironic in its praise – poking fun at the upper classes who might revere it as an item of luxury.Though the true origin of the poem is debated, it was one of Burns’ first poems to be published in the Edinburgh periodical, The Caledonian Mercury, on December , .A quick video search for an “Address to the Haggis” brings up hundreds of results, ranging from a “Haggis Address for Kids”, recitals at kitchen tables and in dingy restaurants - to a piper in full dress, piping the dish into the National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh.  High-society lestyle magazine Tatler recently published an article titled “Where to head for the finest Burns Night supper in London” - it’s clear that the Address to the Haggis can and should be performed in places both high and low. As thousands of Addresses to the Haggis continue to be made the world over, it’s inevitable that each one will have a character of its own - something the Bard himself would surely have approved of. Fair fa your honest, sonsie face, Great chieftain o the pudding-race! Aboon them a ye tak your place, Painch, tripe, or thairm : Weel are ye wordy oa grace As langs my arm. The groaning trencher there ye fill, Your hurdies like a distant hill, Your pin wad help to mend a mill In time oneed, While thro your pores the dews distil Like amber bead. His kne see rustic Labour dight, An cut you up wi ready sleight, Trenching your gushing entrails bright, Like ony ditch And then, O what a glorious sight, Warm-reekin, rich! Then, horn for horn, they stretch an strive: Deil tak the hindmost! on they drive, Till a their weel-swalld kytes belyve Are bent like drums Then auld Guidman, maist like to rive, Bethankit! hums. Is there that owre his French ragout Or olio that wad staw a sow, Or fricassee wad make her spew Wi perfect sconner, Looks down wi sneering, scornfu view On sic a dinner  Poor devil! see him owre his trash, As feckless as witherd rash, His spindle shank, a guid whip-lash His nieve a nit Thro bloody flood or field to dash, O how unfit! But mark the Rustic, haggis-fed, The trembling earth resounds his tread. Clap in his walie nieve a blade, Hell mak it whissle An legs an arms, an heads will sned, Like taps o thrissle. Ye Powrs, wha mak mankind your care, And dish them out their bill o fare, Auld Scotland wants nae skinking ware That jaups in luggies But,ye wish her gratefu prayer Gie her a haggis! "},{"url":null,"title":"covid-scotland-nicola-sturgeon-say-today-face-masks-working-home","story":"The final restrictions that were put in place in response to the Omicron iant were removed on Monday, January .In an update last week the First Minister announced that nightclubs would be able to reopen, and caps on indoor events and table service requirements where alcohol is served would be removed.These measures were put in place in December, alongside a maximum capacity of  people for outdoor events.

and pedestrians risk failing to boost safety due to not being widely promoted, campaigners have warned.Charity Cycling UK said that a “long-term and well-funded communications campaign” is needed to make people aware of the update.The Highway Code, which contains advice and rules for people on Britain’s roads, is being amended this weekend to introduce a risk-based hierarchy of road users.Here’s everything you need to know about what’s new as the rules of the roads receive an update.Hierarchy of road usersA new hierarchy means people in charge of vehicles that can cause the most harm in the event of a collision have the greatest responsibility to look out for other road users.Walking, cycling or riding in shared spacesCyclists should not overtake people walking or riding a horse in shared spaces closely or at high speed, while pedestrians should take care not to obstruct paths.Positioning of cyclistsCyclists should make themselves as visible as possible by riding in the centre of lanes on quiet roads, in slower-moving traffic and at the approach to junctions.Pedestrians crossing at junctionsTurning traffic should give way when people are crossing or waiting to cross at junctions.Traffic must give way to people on zebra crossings.Overtaking cyclistsDrivers travelling at speeds of up to mph should leave at least . metres when overtaking cyclists.They should give more space when overtaking at higher speeds.Opening car doorsCar occupants should open doors using their hand on the opposite side to the door, making them turn their head to look over their shoulder.This technique, known as the Dutch Reach, reduces the chances of doors being opened into the path of cyclists and motorcyclists.Overtaking cyclists at junctionsWhen cyclists are going straight ahead at a junction, they have priority over traffic waiting to turn into or out of a side road, unless road signs or markings indicate otherwise.Cycling in groupsPeople cycling can ride two abreast but should be considerate of the needs of other road users when in groups.RoundaboutsDrivers should take extra care when entering roundabouts to make sure they do not cut across cyclists.Electric vehicle

A le in art and comics pinned to the wall.Read More: \"Stories will be our salvation.\" An interview with MetaphrogI am getting a sneak preview of a new exhibition in the Park Gallery that celebrates Metaphrog’s work. The Franco-Scottish couple are partners in le and art. Marrs is from France. In  she moved to Scotland where she met Greenock-born Chalmers. His background was in science but soon they were making comics together.Over the years Metaphrog have worked on their award-winning series of Louis graphic novels , little fables that work for both children and adults, and, more recently, fairy talesretold in their own inimitable revisionist fashion. Chalmers provides the words, Marrs the images.Mark E Smith in pastels by Sandra Marrs It is Tuesday, a few days before the exhibition opens, and Chalmers and Marrs are giving me the tour.There are  images on the walls, with scripts, models, rough sketches and books also on display. It’s the summation of more than a quarter-century of work. “Sandra has roughly made over  pages in  years,” Chalmers says. The exhibition allows viewers to see how the couple have evolved their ideas of what a comic strip is, from the wordy semi-realist style of their early days on their comic Strange Weather Lately to the jewel-like cartoony beauty of their more recent books.Both words and art seem deceptively simple on the surface of Metaphrog’s work, but there are hidden depths everywhere. Standing in front of a page taken from one of their Louis books, Chalmers begins to talk of the couple’s love of Pollok Park in their home city of Glasgow. On the wall behind him, a green verdant space sprawls across the comic page.Is that Pollok Park in this illustration, I ask  “A dream version.”Walking around the room, the couple chat about the notion of time in comics, the importance of libraries, novelist Vladimir Nabokov’s love of chess, their own shared love of insects and the interplay between words and pictures on the page. The Graphic Novel World of Metaphrog exhibition at Park Gallery, Callendar House, Falkirk “If there are too many words you lose the sense of the musicality of the flow of the pictures,” Chalmers points out. “Sometimes it needs words. Sometimes it’s got to be quiet so when a word comes it is like an explosion. Words have power.”The paintings, including Mark E Smith, are a chance to reflect the iety of Marrs’s artistic talents. “Over Christmas, when we were taking a break, I felt like doing something a bit dferent that’s not comics,” Marrs explains. “It’s completely dferent doing something where I can just do shading. It’s more meditative.“These are pastels,” she says, motioning to the pictures on the wall, where the singer of The Fall is close neighbours to two drawings of the Mexican artist Frida Kahlo.“Mark E Smith is John’s hero. I actually did it for the anniversary of his death. And then Kahlo, yeah, she’s the Jesus Christ of painting. She’s a martyr.”The exhibition is also an opportunity for the couple to take stock of all they’ve achieved since they first met in October .The Red Shoes by Metaphrog “It’s weird seeing all the work in one room,” says Marrs.Said work was a perfect fit for the Park Gallery in Callendar House, exhibitions officer Gillian Smith explains.“This is the Year of Stories. And looking at John and Sandra’s work I was blown away by the link between art and literacy and I thought it would work really well in the gallery. Beautul imagery and the stories behind it.”Welcome to Metaphrog’s world.The Graphic Novel World of Metaphrog opens tomorrow at Callendar House, Falkirk, and runs until April .

The people of Scotland dont want or need another referendum. They need their council well funded, not starved of the funding needed to deliver vital services. My own council is around £ million down in the last  years with more to come in  . Most of these cuts come from the SNP at Holyrood.The council elections need to be about local issues and local funding, not about irrelevant and isive questions on the constitution questions that have been asked and answered on numerous occasions and which do nothing to address the real problems that councils face in delivering vital services to our deserving communities.Alex Gallagher, Labour councillor, Largs.A CAUSE BIGGER THAN THE SNPI AGREE with much of what Neil Mackay says where he worries that the left won’t support the SNP . However, independence is so much bigger than the SNP, or any party.Independence is a normal thing, and Scotland would survive and prosper without a shadow of a doubt, whoever was in power at Holyrood.Post-independence all of us can vote in whichever party we decide. Dferent parties would make dferent decisions about the governance of Scotland and there would indeed be dferences in the outcomes, but make no mistake, we would be very much better off than we are under a Westminster government, no matter which party was in power at Holyrood.It’s also very likely that post-independence the Government would be a coalition of some colour and would take Scotland to new and unprecedented levels of prosperity in the years to come. Our aspiration should be to emulate Denmark, for example, rather than a UK where the current corrupt system will prevail for decades to come.George Archibald, West Linton.YOUNG CANNOT BE DENIEDWALTER Paulreminds Ruth Marr\"gently\" that Scotland did not vote strongly in  to remain in the EU as \"it was a national referendum\". I would remind him, not gently, but firmly, that Ms Marrs assertion is absolutely accurate as the EU vote was a UK referendum and the UK, unlike Scotland, is not a nation but a union of political jurisdictions comprising three nations and part of a fourth.In the spirit of gentle reminders I would also point out that although \"once in a generation\" may have been uttered by certain SNP politicians in , including Alex Salmond, whose reference to \"the current political generation\" is widely misquoted, there was no mention of a time limit on the ballot paper and the democratic choices of the entire Scottish nation cannot be denied on the strength of remarks made by a couple of iniduals among a nation of six millions. Neither will the many young Scots who were too young to vote in  be content to accept Mr Pauls view that his generation had settled the independence question for the foreseeable future. I am astounded to learn, in the week when we remember Robert Burns, that Mr Paul was unaware that the Union of  was consented to by the \"Parcel of Rogues in a nation\" rather than by the people of Scotland.Willie Maclean, Milngavie.WHAT IS THERE TO FEAR WALTER Paul is correct when he says democracy is about debate and ideas, but he trots out the old unionist trope that the Scottish referendum was a \"once in a letime event\". The problem with this idea is that although the referendum result in  was  per cent for independence and % to remain under Westminster rule, the demand for Scottish independence has not gone away and the democratic call for a second referendum has been answered in the democratic way, in the  Westminster General Election, where  SNP MPs were elected and at the Holyrood elections in , where a majority of MSPs in favour of Scottish independence were elected.Therefore, I put the question to Mr Paul and those who believe in democracy and rule from Westminster: just what are you so afraid of from a second Scottish referendum Alec Oattes, Ayr.* THERE is absolutely no point in Walter Paul telling us, however gently, that Scotland did not vote strongly to remain in the EU, when the plain fact is that Scotland did. Mr Paul may believe that“black is white when looked at from the proper point of view” and that “Yes is but another and a neater form of no” but, even though the present political scene may suggest otherwise, we are not living in a Gilbert and Sullivan opera.I recall from many years ago a regular letter-writer who conscientiously and iniably referred to “the Scottish part of our country” and “the English part of our country”. Even people with that mindset, of whom Mr Paul appears to be one, must however acknowledge that the wishes of “the Scottish part of our country” should carry some weight andthey are treated as of no consequence by “the English part of our country”, then the two “parts” are unlikely to remain “parts” of the same unit for very long.Derrick McClure, Aberdeen.SNP SEEKS TOTAL CONTROLNICOLA Sturgeon wants to turn Scotland into her personal fiefdom. Not content that she rules over the family-controlled political party that is the SNP, she wants to make emergency powers raised during Covid permanent . Rather than making le better for Scots, the SNP just keeps nibbling away at personal freedom in search of total control.There has been the anti-family Named Person debacle, the hypothetical thought-led Offensive Behaviour at Football Act and the illogical, badly thought-out hate crime laws. This Government wants changes in law merely to virtue-signal or to cover up its inability to make le better for Scots.Bill Adair, Renfrewshire.A DIVIDED, HATEFUL COUNTRYMY we was talking to a pal who grew up in Ayr, as I did. And like me ed to Ayr possibly more by accident than design. She told my we she did not like living in Ayr. I do like living in Ayr, albeit mismanaged as it is by a succession of poor parish pump politicians, but I just don’t like living in Scotland. Figure that.I simply cannot thole what my country has become ided, hateful, shabby, increasingly dependent on a public sector that we cannot afford, and subservient to a class of overpaid, unqualied people who dare to presume they have the insight, talent or hinterland to lead.John Dunlop, Ayr.ACCEPTING RESULT IS NOT BIZARREDAVID Clarkresponds to Jane Laxs letter of January  by stating he finds her point of view \"bizarre\". Could it be that despite voting for Remain Ms Lax accepts and respects the democratic outcome of a referendum  Theres something not so bizarre to consider.Laurence Wade, Ayr.* JANE Lax is quite right to point out that the mediashould not be able to influence the removal of a Prime Minister, but equally nor should a small number of MPs be empowered to have him removed. However, that is exactly what happened when Theresa May, the PM’s predecessor, was usurped.Francis Deigman, Erskine.Read more: Why my anger over partying Boris Johnson gets stronger every day"},{"url":null,"title":"kilmarnock-hold-talks-scott-allan-hibernian-midfielder-eyes-easter-road-exit","story":"The former Celtic man is out of contract in the summer and is looking for the next step in his career.Dundee and St Mirren have been linked with a move for Allan this window, but The Sun now say that Championship outfit Kilmarnock are interested.The report goes on to say that Allan has held talks with Derek McInnes over a possible move as Killie aim for promotion back into the Premiership.Kilmarnock face off against Inverness in the Championship tomorrow and McInnes is hoping to land three points.Speaking ahead of the clash, he said: \"I think every game is important now, we are getting to that part of the season where youre playing teams around you and you have the chance to get three points whilst dealing damage to the opposition.\"But Inverness will be seeing it exactly the same, I have seen them in the flesh a few times this season and I am really impressed with the work Doddsy has done.\"They are a well ing team, they are organised and they have good players.\"When they get into the opposition half they like to get plenty of crosses in, they will come here and ask the questions.\"I know they havent won a lot of games of late, but they havent lost a lot either.\"They got off to a flyer at the start of the season and you can see why.\"We have got a job to do, hopefully we can win three points because we need to start winning more home games.\"We are now at the stage of the season where we need to start getting a bit of momentum and get a few wins back-to-back.\" "},{"url":null,"title":"scotlands-northern-isles-orca-pod-welcomes-new-addition-family","story":"The pictures reportedly show the newest addition to the Northern Isles Community pod, a group most usually seen hunting seals around the north coast of the Scottish mainland, and across Orkney and Shetland. Some members of the pod have also been documented around Iceland feeding on schooling fish such as Herring.This sets them apart from their “type ” cousins who are spotted along the west coast and Western Isles.

We need to be careful that the national messaging, which currently sits well within larger city areas, does not impact negatively here.“The simple solution is for everyone to maintain the good practices in place that have kept many of us safe to this point. They include the wearing of masks, distancing, sanitising and keeping up the regular lateral flow testing and logging the results online whether positive or negative which help our colleagues in Public Health keep on top of potential community transmission.”The Scottish Government has announced new guidance on working from home will come into effect on Monday, January .This will recommend that employers consider a hybrid working system, with staff spending some time in the office and some time at home.Businesses had previously been asked to enable staff to work from home where possible.The requirement for physical distancing in settings where certain people are exempt from wearing face coverings # like those leading religious services or carrying out some receptionist duties # will be reduced from m to m from January .Face coverings will no longer be required for any adult taking part in organised activities with children under the age of five.OLECG vice-chair and the council’s interim executive director of environmental, property  IT services, Hayley Green, said: “Our business continuity plans are holding up but there remains a fragility and we do not want to react in a manner that could potentially risk services, particularly frontline essential services, by implementing change too quickly # we must maintain a steady as we go approach. We do not expect any signicant changes in the meantime in terms of how we are operating.“We will consider the new guidance carefully and make decisions based on the safety of all and the resilience of our operations.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It is moored on a single tension tether. The subsea location and ability to winch low in the water column enables extreme storm loadings to be avoided so that the device can continue to operate in rough sea conditions. The Waveswing is designed to react to long ocean swell waves as well as short, wind-driven seas, for high energy capture.The £. million prototype project has been funded by Wave Energy Scotlandas part of the Novel Wave Energy Converter development programme. The demonstration at EMEC is also supported by the Interreg North-West Europe’s Ocean DEMO project.Neil Kermode, managing director, EMEC said:“We’re delighted to welcome AWS and the Archimedes Waveswing to Orkney and support its deployment and testing at our site in Scapa Flow.“Real sea deployment is a vital step in proving performance, reliability and survivability of these devices. We know that prototype testing at sea is really valuable to technology developers to check how a technology and its components work and react in the environment prior to scaling up. We are looking forward to helping the team as they prove how to install, operate and maintain their exciting machine in Orkney’s harsh conditions.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Lots of parks were mentioned where local groups had got together to develop them, like the one in Plockton and the one in Kyleakin.”Tfany was given a helping hand by friend Gary Shinnie who suggested the old park in Matheson Place, which had been left to rot, and agreed to assemble a squad of volunteers to help clear the site.After chatting to Highland Councillor John Gordon, Drew Millar from the local community council, and the Portree and Braes Community Trust, and a representative from the Lochalsh and Skye Housing Association it was decided that the best way for Tfany to take the project forward would be through the Trust’s Outdoor Activity group.The project was able to acquire £, from the National Lottery, and the group raised £,. last Friday and Saturday at the Co-op in Portree.Commenting on the response, Tfany said: #Friday and Saturday wasn#t just about fundraising it was also about making people aware of the project.“When people were standing and put their signatures down, we were able to explain to them what we were doing, and when they saw the plans, most people said that it was a great idea, and they loved the fact that it had things for children with special needs in it.”The group is raising money through funding applications, a JustGiving page, and is also inviting businesses to get involved in supporting the project too.A D plan of the play park has been made by Kompan, who also worked on the new playpark in Kyleakin.The park will comprise  dferent play activities including four swings, an octopus seesaw, a carousel, a four-tower unit with a tunnel and a slide, it will be able to accommodate  users of all ages.Although there’s still plenty to do to bring the play park to le, Tfany is confident that it will happen, and this year.to donate to project."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Sanas-Padlet-266-x-150-mm-1.jpg","title":"dreuchd ur ann an","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineADVERTISING FEATURE: NEW YEAR, NEW CAREERAig an àm seo den bhliadhna, bidh sinn tric a’ smaoineachadh air ar dreuchdan atharrachadh agus mar sin is dòcha gum bi an goireas ùr aig Bòrd na Gàidhlig feumail dhuibh ma tha sibh a’ beachdachadh air dreuchd ùr ann an teagasg tro mheadhan na Gàidhlig.’S e goireas didseatach a th’ ann am padlet far a bheil làraich-lìn, sgrìobhainnean agus bhideothan air an cruinneachadh air balla.

They prefer instead to view Gaelic as a natural medium for their music # a not atypical outlook for their island generation raised with the language as part of their education during the s.And this should be encouraging, for the key to the future survival of the language will lie not in its exceptionalism, but in its ordinariness.While Gaelic may be natural to Niteworks, what sets them apart is how they use it. Their trademark sound is forged from the rich Hebridean song tradition of their native communities, and the dance music they listened to in their bedrooms, and later in Glasgow nightclubs.They have just released their third album # A’ Ghrian,– which follows the eponymous debut album of  and Air Fàir An Làwhich came out in .In what should have been one of the marquee events of Glasgow’s Celtic Connections festival, last Friday Niteworks should have been on stage with the Royal Scottish National Orchestra. But to immense frustration and disappointment, Covid restrictions were not been lted in time and the concert has been rescheduled for the summer.Unsurprisingly, lockdown and the pandemic are themes that have influenced the new album, says band member Allan MacDonald.. “It has been over two years since I have been to a club as a punter.“That was a huge part of our lives. I wouldn’t say it has changed our musical tastes, but what we listen to at home now is dferent to what we would listen to in a club.“That has influenced us and the direction we are going as a band. We’re also getting a bit older, there’s two in the band that have young families now and this album is perhaps a bit more reflective than the others.”It is approaching  years since the quartet put on their first gig – at Braes Hall as part of the year of Highland culture celebrations in . Their first EP followed in , and Niteworks have since become regulars on the festival circuit # including annual appearances at SkyeLive in Portree.They aren’t full time as a band, however, and online rehearsing was a familiar process to them long before the outset of the pandemic.Allan, who is from Braes and from a family of pipers, works in renewable energy and is based in London. Synth and keyboard player Innes Strachan from Breakish works in sound production in Glasgow drummer Ruaraidh Graham, also from Breakish, works in Edinburgh for Historic Environment Scotland and bass player Chris Nicolson, from Braes, is with the BBC in Inverness.One of their ‘lockdown projects’ included writing the music to mark Edinburgh’s Hogmanay, and in turn this led to the orchestral collaboration and the more ‘expansive and cinematic’ sound of the new album, says Ruairidh Graham.“We were partly inspired by our work writing the music for Edinburgh’s Hogmanay Fare Well film that reflected on what  had been like for many during the pandemic,” he adds. “The nature of the project required broad expansive sounds, and that led to us going further in that direction through the writing and recording of the album.“Our upcoming orchestral concert for Celtic Connections further reinforced our desire to keep down that path.”There is an abundance of vocal talent to be found on A’ Ghrian, including from long-time collaborators Sian . Celebrated Scottish singers Kathleen MacInnes, Beth Malcolm, Hannah Rarity and Alasdair Whyte also feature, and Niteworks have incorporated English folk and Scots songs into their repertoire for the first time.The album, which was funded by Creative Scotland and recorded in autumn , also features Fiona MacAskill, Aileen Reid and Laura Wilkie of Kinnaris Quintet alongside Susan Appelbe on strings.A’ Ghrian is available to buy on CD and stream and download on all digital s, and the band will tour the until the end of .

Read MoreUK won’t step inDUP orders halt to Brexit checks at ports, says Foreign Secretary Liz TrussCould she be next, given the pressures currently facing Boris Johnson  She’s constantly appraised for evidence of leadership ambition. When she posted a picture of herself last year in a tank in Estonia in an apparent homage to Margaret Thatcher’s famous  tank-driving photo opportunity, her status as PM-in-waiting was sealed.But when I asked herher negotiations with the EU had been undermined by Boris Johnson describing the EU as taking an “insane and pettogging” approach to the protocol in the House of Commons, she launched straight into a defence of the PM. She will be loyal until the time is right.Adapting to ied Prime Ministerial temperaments and policies takes flexibility, and Liz Truss has demonstrated plenty of that. She’s an avowed Thatcherite who grew up with left-wing parents, and a Remain voter who got with the Brexit programme after the referendum.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up The quality of flexibility is one she’s bringing to her newest set of responsibilities as the UK’s post-Brexit negotiator. Former Brexit negotiator Lord Frost, who resigned in December over his opposition to a tightening of coronavirus restrictions, styled himself as a tough guy who appeared to relish pulling the rug from under the EU’s feet by taking unilateral action on thorny matters.Liz Truss couldn’t form a greater contrast. The first businessperson I spoke to earlier this month who’d had a meeting with her quoted her saying: “There is a deal to be done.” And that has been a constant refrain, so it now seems a matter of when and nota new agreement will be reached on the protocol. She emphasised yesterday that the process was about negotiating, about finding a deal which suits the EU by protecting the single market, and which suits the UK, and communities in Northern Ireland.The Foreign Secretary also has a reputation for quirkiness, which wasn’t particularly in evidence yesterday.As Environment Secretary in , she made a speech lamenting Britain’s dependence on imports of many products it made itself, saying: “We import two-thirds of our cheese. That is a disgrace.”Her staccato delivery of the second sentence launched many memes and much mocking. But anyone who belittled LT in those days completely under-estimated her.

The department is led by DUP Minister Edwin Poots.Ms Truss, who was visiting Northern Ireland to learn more about the effects of the protocol, said it was “a matter for the NI Executive” to resolve, rather than one for the UK to intervene onthe DUP acts to halt checks. “What I would say is we are working flat out to sort out the issues with the protocol.

We’re all part of the UK, we’re all part of the same market, the same business relationships, the same community, and that is why it’s important that we solve this problem.”She said it was “great”businesses based here could step into the supply gap “but people should have the choice and the choice from businesses in their own country”. It does undermine the constitutional settlementthose goods aren’t able to readily flow.” She said she hoped there would be “signicant progress” on a deal by February  but that it was slow work.“We are spending time going through all of the details about how to make things work better. That takes time.It’s complex, I visited the port today, I’ve seen the systems and the dferent paperwork being used. This is not easy stuff. So it does take time for our teams to share information, to work it out how to do this better.“I’m very clear this needs to be a shared solution between the UK and EU. We want to protect the sovereignty and the territorial integrity of the UK, we want the free flow of goods and the EU wants to protect the single market. I understand that that is their aspiration, we need to find the sweet spot that manages to achieve both of those things.“I think that is doable but it does take intense discussions.”She said there was no benefit to considering whether the protocol should have been agreed to at the time. “We now have experience of the protocol having been in place and we should use that experience and the issues that we have seen as a result of the protocol to inform making it better and improving it.”Related topicsNI ProtocolThe Executive OfficeEdwin PootsMaros SefcovicMore On NI Protocol PremiumAlex KaneOpinionResurgent English nationalism has fractured the UnionHouseholders face a huge squeeze on energy budgets... and there may be no end in sight PremiumDonaldson criticised for warning that Givan could be pulled from First Minister role next weekBoris Johnson claims EU enforcing NI Protocol in ‘insane and pettogging way’ PremiumConsiderable unionist support for DUP stance on scrapping ProtocolMost ReadIn Pictures: Bloody Sunday... images from the BelfastarchivesLap of luxury: New £.m Portrush hotel Elephant Rock is designed to stand out from the herdUK won’t step inDUP orders halt to Brexit checks at ports, says Foreign Secretary Liz TrussRavenhill crash victim Jon O’Hara remembered as ‘clever, witty, loving’DUP’s Wells deselected in South Down – as Poots considered for constituencyTop VideosPlayFormer DUP leader Edwin Poots arrives at the party’s east Belfast headquarters.

We have taken back control of our waters and a year on from the Trade and Co-operation Agreement a positive picture is emerging for our fishing industry, he continued.ldquoWe have seen an increase in quota that will amount to around poundm by  and are investing poundm into coastal communities so that they can benefit from better infrastructure, new jobs and investment in skills.Local councillor Dermot Curran is encouraging people to respond to the consultation exercise, to reduce the impact of fishing on the marine environment, as well as support the industry. And he hopes that all three Co Down fishing ports will benefit from the funding that is to be made available.ldquoI am keen to see more detail to see exactly how Ardglass in particular can benefit from financial support at a time when there is much focus on a range of work that is required at the village harbour, Cllr Curran continued.ldquoThe need to deepen the harbour to facilitate larger vessels is key moving forward, but the need to have a dedicated boat repair facility in the village has also been raised with me. Currently, vessels have to go where to be repaired.ldquoIf Ardglass had its own dedicated repair facility, it would not only be able to service local boats but those based in other ports. Investment to repair boats locally would also create jobs.Cllr Curran said everyone with an interest in the fishing industry should make the most of the opportunity to comment on the detail in the joint fisheries statement.ldquoConfirmation that poundm is being made available for fishing communities is excellent news and I hope that the ports of Ardglass, Kilkeel and Portavogie will be able to share this very welcome additional financial investment, he continued.ldquoThis is an important step forward and clearly Minister Poots is committed to the Co Down fishing industry and the processing industries and communities which rely heavily upon it. This new investment will help safeguard all their respective futures which is good news. The investment will boost the local and regional economy.Last year, it was revealed that investment in the region of poundm is needed to upgrade Ardglass harbour to help maximise the portrsquos future opportunities.The Fishing and Seafood Development Programme reportrsquos recommendations for Ardglass included enhancing capacity at the harbour to provide security for fishing and processing businesses,The report revealed that a survey of the harbour walls in Ardglass showed that some repairs may be required within the next one to two years but their condition will not prevent the deepening of the harbour mdash to nine metres below the waterline mdashthey are stabilised and protected from undermining prior to dredging operations.It says the current water depth and quaysideprevents larger fishing vessels from landing at Ardglass with tankers transporting fish landed in Belfast to the village for processing. Mackerel and Irish Sea herring continue to be landed in Ardglass.The report said there is inadequate space for growing the inshore fleet at the port as the quayside is dominated by the larger demersal fleet and occasional visiting pelagic vessels, with the adjoining marina for the exclusive use of leisure craft.It was also noted that a constraint to the landside development of the harbourrsquos estate is the mixed ownership of existing properties which prevents the Fishery Harbour Authority from having full control over activities at the port and limits the ability to plan strategically..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26_January2022_Caoimhe.jpg","title":"Caoimhe raises £900 for turtle rehabilation scheme in Maldives  ","story":"WHEN it comes to conservation, Downpatrick woman Caoimhe Morgan-Burns practices what she preaches.The  year-old has raised pound by collecting rubbish from the sides of the Ardglass Road and Ballysallagh Road.The money is to go towards the cost of a pound, trip to Naaru Island in the Males in June where Caoimhe will devote four weeks of her time to volunteer at a sea turtle rehabilitation centre.The trip will mean a lot to Caoimhe, a former pupil at Shimna Integrated College in Newcastle, as she will head to Bristol University in September to study Wildle Ecology and Conservation Science.Caoimhe plans to plant some trees on her familyrsquos land so and is thinking up of other fund-raising initiatives towards the cost of the trip.She spent over five hours removing rubbish from the edges of the road and was dismayed by how much she collected from her own home road.ldquoI collected  bin bags full of rubbish.

I accused the departmental officials of paralysis by analysis and unfortunately that has proved to be true.ldquoSince then, of course, the traffic congestion, which is now traffic chaos, has been greatly increased by the Irish Street closure, and it should be noted that not a single traffic management action has been initiated in the interval, he continued.NEWCASTLE ndash A cross-community unity campaign has been launched to save Newcastlersquos only public residential home from closure.Mourne House has been targeted for closed by the Eastern Health and Social Services Board but this week local politicians have joined with the Friends of Mourne House in mobilising public support against the plan.Representatives from the Friends group have already met with Board officials in a bid to persuade them to adopt a proposal from the charity, Age Concern, which is offering to take over the management of the  year-old home.DUNDRUM ndash Over pound, damage has been caused in another arson attack in Dundrum.Two caravans were completely destroyed and another badly damaged in the attack at the Bayview Caravan Site off the Dromara Road early on Saturday morning.It is believed the blazes were started in the early hours and two of the caravans were well alight by the time fire crews arrived on the scene.The incident is the latest in a long line of malicious arson attacks in the village which police believe are the work of a pyromaniac.Just before Christmas the villagersquos two primary schools were targeted with the Downshire Primary School sustaining over pound, damage. The arsonist has also attacked Dundrum cricket club, the orange hall and the parochial hall.BRYANSFORD ndash Plans have been announced to convert one of Bryansfordrsquos most historic landmarks into apartments, a craft shop and a restaurant.The former home of the Earl of Roden, close to the gates of Tollymore Park, will be converted into eight apartments, and an outbuilding will be extended to form a craft shop and restaurant facilityplanning permission is granted by the DoE.A further planning application proposes to build a number of luxury apartments on a site to the rear of the building, with an access from the nearby Burrenreagh Road.The building, which comprises extensive outbuildings and a courtyard, was used as a travellersrsquo inn during the last century when the Roden family lived in Tollymore House in the forest park.Since the destruction of Tollymore House the inn has been the home of the present Earl of Roden. In  it was the scene of an antiques robbery in which Lord Roden was tied up and threatened as raiders stole valuable paintings and antiques.Part of the outbuildings were regularly used by youth groups for residential weekends in the Mournes.BALLYNAHINCH ndash The job losses at the Ballynahinch GPT plant mean the lsquoBig Threersquo players in Down District industry no longer top the  jobs mark.GEC Plessey Telecommunications was the last of the lsquoBig Threersquo to employ more than  on one site.The lay-offs mean there are virtually no large-scale industrial employers left in Down.The GPT plant has been set on a steady course of expansion, even after the amalgamation of Plessey, as it then was, with GEC in . It took over the vacant Albion clothing factory on the Antrim Road and at one point last year was employing  people.The number has been whittled away and will be reduced to  employees.The other two major employers have also been hit over the last four years. The Shirley Tannery, owned by English-based Pittard Garnar at the time, employed  until its closure was announced in February . Although it re-opened later that year, the numbers employed has been dramatically scaled down.The decline in the numbers is even more pronounced when it is considered that in its heyday in the late rsquos, the tannery employed up to  people.STRANGFORD ndash There has been a renewed call for a bridge linking Strangford and Portaferry.The newly-formed Strangford Lough Bridge Project Group says a bridge across the Strangford Narrows is the only means of guaranteeing a continuous link across the lough.However, the group accepts that a scheme involving a barrage to harness tidal power would be environmentally unacceptable.Group chairman, Mr James McMullan, from Portaferry, said ldquoI believe there is overwhelming support for a bridge.ldquoPeople in Portaferry are concerned about the future of the DoE ferry service. A bridge has to be the ultimate answer. It would provide a link  hours a day and would not be subject to breakdowns, he continued.And Mr McMullan says he intends to seek the support of local councillors for his proposal.ldquoI accept a barrage would have environmental implications but a bridge on its own would benefit communities on both sides of the lough, he added.RACING ndash A campaign to introduce Sunday horse racing in Britain could result in Sabbath day racing coming under starters orders at Downpatrick.Mr Iain Duff, course registrar at Downpatrick, has given his support to the Jockey Club campaign and is demanding sweeping changes in legislation which prohibits betting on a Sunday.Mr Duff says Downpatrick and Down Royal ndash the Provincersquos other racetrack ndash should be allowed to hold Sunday meetings.Mr Duff says the law could be changed easily by making an Order in Council which would then enable tracks to hold meetings when people are most prepared to go racing on Sunday.He believes the move is needed to bring racing here into line with the Republic where Sunday racing was introduced some years ago.ldquoSunday racing in the Republic has proved to be a wholesale success.

Irsquod love to introduce you to approaches that are foundations that last and make you feel empowered and happier in  and beyond.What I think is essential, when we want to stop a bad habit or make a change in our lives, is to make sure that we are on our own side.Self-compassion is basically being your own best friend.

It helps us be in the present moment and be calm as we take in the sights, sounds and touch mdash even taste mdash around us.Mindfulness and meditation have been trendy in recent years, but from my one-to-one counselling work, quite a few people have said that ldquoit didnrsquot work for them, or ldquoI didnrsquot really see the benefits.Once we talked about that more, we came to the realisation that they were practicing mindfulness to not feel, to escape feeling uncomfortable or to push away dficult or negative thoughts. As a practice, things changed for the better once my clients were made aware that mindfulness was to observe their feelings and observe their thoughts with an open mind as attention was gently brought back to the breath.Taking little pockets of time in our day to consciously pause, taking a few breaths in and out and observe, can immediately let our bodies and minds be calm and focused.The small daily things are the most important things to ensure real change. You can try this little exercise and be aware how your body and mind feels:S  ndash Step back.T ndash Take three deep breaths in and three slow breaths out.O  ndash Observe the thoughts and feelings in that very moment.P ndash Proceed.Awareness also involves being able to see patterns that arise in our thoughts and feelings, as well as the behavioural outcome. Kind of like detective work, we are then able to reframe our thinking, as well as breaking the familiar cycle of judgement and frustration. Just a wee word about practicing awareness mdash it is not about self control. Awareness helps us to begin to understand ourselves and develop self compassion and practice patience .Essentially, self awareness is about empowering ourselves and providing regulation of our body and mind. Self-regulation in turn, seeks to identy and reduce the causes of problems in mood, thought and behaviour.Self-control seeks to inhibit or manage such problems only when they arise. Self-control looks at old methods of punishment and reward to manage behaviour ndash maybe like the way we begin every New Year resolution mdash or every Monday, etc.AcceptanceEspecially when a New Year starts ndash therersquos this pressure to go to extreme measures, with this notion of being accepted more, to be seen and or valued more. But pretty much into the month of January we notice how it can rob us of truly living.We are not human DOINGS ndash we are human BEINGS. I have worked over the last  years as a counsellor and have heard people talk about trying to control their lives, but feeling like it was evading them more and more.Clients found themselves going harder, pushing harder, feeling exhausted, feeling helpless ndash then pulling up their socks and trying again. Although it may go against the grain of whatrsquos familiar, itrsquos healing to ease ourselves from a place of trying mdash to be perfect, as good as others, etc mdash to self-acceptance.Accepting lessens the pressure and helps us go with the flow.Self-acceptance is a journey. If anyone  needs to put pressure on us, itrsquos them who needs to deal with their own expectations mdash not us. Acceptance challenges deeply held beliefs that we are not lsquoworthyrsquo enough or lsquogoodrsquo enough to be whole. Like awareness, acceptance develops self compassion ndash a connected relationship with ourselves.In Dialectical Behavioural Therapy, there is a theory called Radical Acceptance developed by Martina Linehan, who quotes: ldquoRejecting reality turns pain into suffering.It is really tough to accept things how they are, from childhood trauma to unexpected traffic jams. It is really such a relief and sense of clarity when we realise and accept things that we are not in control of.It is absolutely OK to feel whatever we feel in the moment. Itrsquos not just sitting back and letting bad things happen of course. It is quite pro-active from problem solving based on how things actually are, self compassion when paying attention to how we feel in the moment. Meeting emotional pain head on, after all, it is what it is. Acceptance means no more unnecessary suffering.AssertionGabor Mate talks about assertion as a declaration to ourselves and to the world that lsquowe arersquo and that lsquowe are who we arersquo. Itrsquos not being simply able to stand up for ourselves mdash therersquos something more heartfelt than that.Assertion challenges the all too common belief that we must somehow justy our existence. There are lots of things that we can learn about and practice when it comes to assertion in itself, but maybe after reading the first two elements you are realising that our inidual minds, bodies and spirit are all so important.Making decisions about diets, relationships, careers, etc, usually get focused on a lot more during the month of January, as well as quitting things and going cold turkey on habits that have been part of our lives for years.Assertion isnrsquot just a quick course from a manual or podcast about tips and tricks. It is a really important statement of our being. It is a positive valuation of ourselves mdash independent of our history, abilities, personality or the worldrsquos perception of us.In regards to resolutions, assertion doesnrsquot involve action or reaction. Like I said before, it is our BEING, no matterwe take action or not. Assertion helps us be crystal clear about what we value and what is not OK with us as iniduals.From our values we can develop boundaries. Yes, let the rest of the world cope with that, or not. In fact, assertion may be the very opposite of action, not only in the sense of refusing to do something that we do not wish to do, but letting go of the very need to act at all.I really do hope that  gives you gts and wonderful surprises, as well as the comfort and support over dficult times.

This device is located in a mph zone.A closer examination of the latest PCSP figures reveal that the mph speed in Ardglass was recorded on November  at am.In addition,  drivers were clocked at travelling over mph in the mph zone at the entrance to the village, with almost  percent of drivers detected travelling at between mph and mph. Thirty eight percent of drivers were detected driving at between mph and mph.The provision of the series of electronic devices was in response to community concern about speeding across the district and viewed as part of a major offensive on those who break the law and to encourage drivers to slow down.PCSP officials say the average speeds recorded in Downpatrick, Killyleagh and Newcastle have reduced with no change in Newcastle. However, concern remains about the dangerous speeds that continue to be recorded with some drivers showing a blatant disregard for the speed limits in place.The highest speed recorded at the Strangford Road in Downpatrick was mph in the mph zone at am, with  drivers detected travelling at over mph. Previous speeds recorded at the built-up area have peaked at mph.Residents in the built-up area, which includes a signicant number of houses, a nursing home and local authority depot, have continually expressed concern about the speed of drivers who use the busy road and argue that the speed sign needs to be relocated further back towards the Lecale Park entrance.The highest speed recorded at the Dublin Road in Castlewellan was mph at am, with  drivers recorded travelling in excess of mph, with % of drivers detected travelling between mph and mph.Elsewhere, one driver was detected travelling at mph in the mph zone at the Dundrum Road in Clough at am, with one driver clocked driving in excess of mph.In Killyleagh, a driver was detected travelling at mph in the mph zone on the approach to the townrsquos Integrated Primary School, with  drivers clocked at over mph. The highest number of offences was recorded at pm.The highest speed recorded at the Newcastlersquos South Promenade was mph, with two drivers recorded travelling at over mph. The highest number of speed offences were recorded around am.Across the council area, the latest figures indicate that recorded speeds have reduced by six percent. The average speed of cars travellingpast each sign was mph in Ardglass and Clough, mph in Castlewellan, mph in Downpatrick, mph in Newcastle and mph in Newcastle.The PCSP is planning to install seven more speed indicator signs with demand for the devices described as ldquohigh with particular interest from residents and councillors in the Downpatrick, Rowallane, Slieve Croob and Mournes district electoral areas.Local councillor Dermot Curran, who lives in Ardglass, has described the mph speed recorded at the Downpatrick Road in the village as ldquotruly shocking.He said while the number of drivers breaking the ious speed limits is reducing, there were a number ldquothumbing their noses at the restrictions in place and posing a serious danger to other road users and pedestrians.ldquoThe fact that drivers are not slowing down in built-up areas, regardless of the time of day, is a real worry. The consequences of a driver losing control of a car travelling at mph is truly frightening. The message that speed kills cannot be reinforced enough,he remarked.ldquoThere is clearly a hardcore of drivers who care little for their own safety, or that of other road users. It is an issue that must be addressed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26_January2022_Ashling.jpg","title":"Twilight vigil for Ashling  ","story":"MEMBERS of Newcastle CCEacute and the wider community came together last week for a twilight vigil in memory of Ashling Murphy, the -year-old teacher from Tullamore, Co Offaly, who was murdered while out running.Musicians gathered at the Garden of Hope at the Lodge in Castlewellan on Tuesday night to pay their respects to the talented traditional musician with music and poetry.Ashling was an active member of the Ballyboy Comhaltas branch in Co Offaly.Many local branch members have spent time in Tullamore attending All Ireland Fleadhs and some have walked along the Grand Canal where Ashling was killed.Some of the Comhaltasrsquo younger musicians were friends with Ashling and played music with her. They enjoyed each otherrsquos company and are still coming to terms with the tragedy.Cllr Roisin Howell, who organised the event, told the assembled people: ldquoAll of us in the branch are shocked and saddened by the death of Ashling Murphy.ldquoThe brutal manner of her death has both angered and bewildered the entire nation. We stand here in the Garden of Hope, united this evening, keeping Ashlingrsquos family and friends in our thoughts and prayers.A poem by Belfast writer Helen McClements was read out and the musicians honoured Ashlingrsquos memory by playing some of the tunes they had played with her.People also left candles and flowers at the monument as the music played.The first verse of the poem is as follows:Before she went down to the Grand CanalI wondershe chanced to run earlyCatching the last of the waning sunBefore darkness fellSnuffing out the light..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26_January2022_Brigid.jpg","title":"Two hour talk  to re engage with life of St Brigid and her link to district  ","story":"THE distinctive St Brigidrsquos cross is something that many Catholics are very familiar with, including having fond memories of being taught how to make one at school which was proudly displayed at home.As the the feast day, February , approaches, the interest in the le and work of one of the worldrsquos most beloved saints is still high.Local people will have the chance to re-engage with the story of St Brigid, who is special to the Downpatrick area as she is reputedly buried alongside St Patrick in the grounds of Down Cathedral.Historian and tour guide Brigid Watson, of Sustainable Journeys Ireland, will be hosting a talk on the le of St Brigid with a demonstration of cross-making and a chance for participants to make personal crosses.Entitled Brigid Saint or Goddess, the two-hour talk will be held at the St Patrick Centre in Downpatrick from -pm next Tuesday, February , and again on February  and March .Brigid explains why the story of St Brigid and her namesake remains fascinating to her.ldquoSt Brigid is the female patroness of Ireland and one of the most widely revered saints in Ireland and beyond. She lived in the period -AD and was a visionary spiritual leader and inspirational woman, she explained.ldquoBrigid was recognised as a saint from around the seventh century and seven dferent lsquolivesrsquo of St Brigid were written which is indicative of the cult following she had.ldquoHer feast day is on February which is the first day of spring mdash Imbolc in the Celtic calendar. There are three other feasts in the Celtic calendar mdash May , Bealtaine August , Luacutenasa and November,  Samhain. Each of the feasts has associated with it a specic set of beliefs and customs.ldquoThere was a pre-Christian aspect to the feast on February . The main importance of the feast of St Brigid would appear to be that it was a christianisation of one of the key dates in the farming year in Ireland. In earlier centuries in Ireland and in many areas St Brigidrsquos day was observed as a holiday and some farming related activities were not permitted. In , the government of the Republic of Ireland decided to make the February  a bank holiday. This is an inspired choice of date for the new bank holiday.Brigid said the main customs associated with St Brigidrsquos Day are the making of St Brigidrsquos crosses the Briacutedeoacuteg and the Brat Briacutede. These customs were traditionally practiced on the eve of St Brigidrsquos feast day as according to Celtic timing, night came before day.The custom of making St Brigidrsquos crosses is still widespread throughout Ireland. There are regional iations across Ireland in the design and composition of the cross. The most common one is the simple four armed cross.ldquoThe explanation of the custom is that St Brigid made the cross when she was comforting a dying man who wished to convert to Christianity. She placed it in his hands, explained Brigid. ldquoPeople believe that the St Brigidrsquos cross offers protection from sickness and other forms of adversity for their homes, family and animals.ldquoToday in Co Down farming and non-farming families still want to get a St Brigidrsquos cross for this reason. In Ulster, a three-armed cross was placed in the stable or byre for the protection of animals. Throughout my le I have made St Brigid crosses for our home.ldquoAs a teacher I have taught groups of pupils how to make the cross. It is important that we pass on customs and traditions to the next generation and do not lose the wealth of culture we have in Ireland.She said that the Briacutedeoacuteg is another custom associated with St Brigidrsquos Day. It consisted, or consists, of a group of young people called briacutedeoga, lsquobiddiesrsquoor biddy-boys going from house to house carrying an effigy of St Brigid .The children received some donation at each house visited. Often a doll was made for the occasion. The body of the doll may have been made from a sheaf of straw. A ball of hay, straw or turnip was used to represent the head. It was usually constructed with a strong stick or churn-dash at its core.The use of the churn dash was thought to reflect the saintrsquos association with dairying. A purchased rag doll might be used. Whether a doll was made or purchased, it was a representation of St Brigid and was dressed in white.The original objective of the exercise was the collection of alms for the poor. The group always provided some entertainment for the homes visited with singing or music. The girls and boys in the group dressed up in disguise for the occasion. The custom lasted longest in Co Kerry and still survives today in a few areas.The third important custom which was widespread throughout Ireland is known as the brat Briacutede . A piece of cloth, larger than a hankerchief, was put on a bush outside the home on the eve of St Brigidrsquos feast day and it was not usually brought in until morning.Brigid added: ldquoThe belief was that when St Brigid was travelling around the country that night and she came across the cloth, she blessed it with the curative powers of her cloak. It was put away and used as a healing cloth throughout the year for sickness, pain and as protection against harm. With changes in society this custom has only survived in some areas including the south and west of Ireland.The historian said that Saint Brigid, who is strongly associated with nature and farming, is ldquoa saint for our times. With the environmental crisis facing us we can learn from the reverence which the early Celtic saints, including St Brigid, showed towards nature. They appreciated the fundamental importance of nature to humanity.ldquoThe challenges we face today are much greater than those in the th and th centuries but the need for social justice is the same. May the le of St Brigid be an inspiration to all to take action for a better world.When she died St Brigid was buried beside the high altar in the church in Kildare. Her remains were brought to Downpatrick for reasons of safety at the time of the Viking raids on monasteries and reburied with those of St Patrick and St Colmcille at Down Cathedral.To book a place at pound for one of talks visit https:www.saintpatrickcentre friends saint-brigids-day-experiences..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/13418771.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Anyone who believes, given the deep isions in our society, that there would be some magic wand that can wave away these fissures is naïve.

Some people believe that a new cultural conflict has replaced the physical conflict that our society endured for three decades. Whole communities feel their cultural identity is either under attack or not recognised. Issues around the flying of flags, bonfires, murals, language, memorials and commemoration ide whole communities. It was perhaps inevitable that any discussion of how people should or should not celebrate their cultural identity in Northern Ireland was going to be a dficult one. Some people believe that even having such a discussion will threaten their ability to express their cultural identity in public spaces.FICT was unusual in that it contained eight independents alongside the representatives from the five main political parties: the DUP, Sinn Fein, the UUP, the SDLP and Alliance. From the off this meant a iety of viewpoints. The internal talks in the commission were, as one would expect, tough, prolonged and, at times given the external political environment, pessimistic. The collapse of the assembly and executive in January , the failed political talks process in , fourelections and the ongoing challenging environment created by Brexit, was not conducive to generating political consensus and agreement at the commission.Despite this FICT, including the five political parties collectively recognised and confirmed that all sections of our community have cultural rights.Furthermore, that they also acknowledged that those rights are enshrined in national and international law, and that these British, Irish, and other identications of culture and heritage, should command equal respect in our society.All members of FICT reached an agreement that included equal respect for the promotion, support and resourcing of both Irish and Ulster Scots British language, culture and heritage within all aspects of civic and social le. The cornerstone of our approach was that these cultural expressions would underpin a community’s right to do so. In turn, it would also require that the ways in which cultural identities are expressed would also respect other people’s identities, sensitivities and safety.The commission agreed that the flying of flags to mark signicant cultural or historic events is a legitimate form of cultural expression. Noting that under present legislation people do not have authority to put flags on lampposts, we suggested some options for changes in legislation to enable this to occur along with a code of conduct. Our essential point is that by giving everyone — including the people who want to fly flags, the people who are not happy with flags being flown without regulation, and the bodies who own the property upon which they are flown — clarity about what is and is not acceptable, a framework could be created that gives everyone fair opportunities to express their identity in ways that everyone could live with.And on bonfires, all five parties agreed that they should be regarded as a legitimate form of cultural expression and recommended practical steps, including changes to legislation and a code of practice, to improve safety, limit environmental damage, and provide everyone with clarity about what is, and isn’t acceptable.It was not surprising that some of the commission’s most intense and dficult discussions were about memorials and commemoration. We agreed, however, that the executive should acknowledge that everyone has a right to remember their dead in a way that is respectful, sensitive, dignied and seeks to avoid causing pain or hurt to others. We also dealt with the fact that our children do not learn about the ‘Others’’ cultural identity either: we all agreed that a healthy society requires this and laid out how the schools curriculum might deliver this.If we want a society, built on mutual respect and interdependence, of one another’s cultural identity, then we have to recognise that this will have be done in a manner appropriate to our society, which is still one emerging from conflict, for the common good of all. This does not mean surrendering any part of anyone’s cultural identity but it does mean being able to celebrate one’s cultural identity in confidence while recognising that others have a valid cultural identity too. These issues will not go away and willagain and again. Our report is not the end of a process but the start of one.• Professor Dominic Bryan is Joint chair of FICT commissioner and Prof Thomas Hennessey and independent commissioner——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

PIC: Rob Youngson Focus Features“I think that I probably began to realise over the years that the leaving of Belfast was really an event that I couldn’t ever escape in its impact,” reflects Sir Kenneth, now . “The film really describes quintessentially a  seconds where my le changed forever, when a mob came down our street, a neighbourhood that otherwise had been very peaceful and harmonious, where we lived side by side with Catholics.“In what followed, which was the street being completely reconfigured into a fortress really, I think a series of things psychologically started to kick in, like they do when youthful experiences have a big impact, that have been with me ever since.“I didn’t know how such a story could manest itself in a film, but at the beginning of this lockdown there were so many similar feelings thrown up of being unsettled, of le providing the unknown, and really a desire to reach for all the things that helped you get through it – humour, human connection, your family, and a search for all the coping mechanisms – music, dancing, anything that asserted le, and fun and certainty at a time when things were so very deeply uncertain.”Kenneth Branagh plays the great Dane in his adapted version of Shakespeares Hamlet in It has taken Sir Kenneth some time to realise that day was “a very, very, I suppose, traumatising thing”.“One of the reasons it takes so long is that a big part of the Northern Ireland DNA is that you don’t go on about stuff like this,” he muses. “You don’t indulge, you don’t suggest that your challenges, your struggles, your problems, are any greater than anybody ’s. “So it’s taken me a long time to get to the point where I realised that remains the truth, but it doesn’t mean that your story doesn’t have some kind of value, quite the opposite, because you begin to recognise that other people might benefit from understanding these moments. with his older brother Bill as children in Belfast before the family move to England after the outbreak of the Troubles in \" \"\" width\"\" srcset\"https:www.newsletter webimg TUFZMTMMzMNDMy.jpg width w, https:www.newsletter webimg TUFZMTMMzMNDMy.jpg width w\" layout\"intrinsic\" class\"i-amphtml-layout-intrinsic i-amphtml-layout-size-defined\" i-amphtml-layout\"intrinsic\" with his older brother Bill as children in Belfast before the family move to England after the outbreak of the Troubles in \" fallback layout\"responsive\" \"\" width\"\" src\" img placeholder.png\" class\"i-amphtml-layout-responsive i-amphtml-layout-size-defined\" i-amphtml-layout\"responsive\"Kenwith his older brother Bill as children in Belfast before the family move to England after the outbreak of the Troubles in “Going back to experience it, in the doing of it, the shooting of it, it wasn’t so bad, because so much of that was mechanics. “It was afterwards, as you put it all together, and as it started to have its own le, it began to be a cumulatively more emotional experience. And it has had me quite a bit closer to tears on a day-to-day basis than I might otherwise be. But part of the process was understanding that tears can be helpful.”It was only during the editing process that Sir Kenneth, whose previous directing projects include Thor, Cinderella and Murder On The Orient Express – as well as a string of Shakespeare adaptations, thought about how the film might be received by others who had lived through this period in history.“The film sort of revealed that that’s what it was about, and that’s what it was for. The weight of sadness across the ious incidents, as well as the tenderness and the hard earned joy, just somehow allowed you to recognise that it was tough for everyone and it was a shared tragedy and the wound is still one that is shared by many people.  stars as Buddy and Jamie Dornan stars as Pa in director Kenneth Branaghs Belfast.PIC:PA Photo Rob Youngson Focus Features.\" \"\" width\"\" srcset\"https:www.newsletter webimg TUFZMTMMzMMDQy.jpg width w, https:www.newsletter webimg TUFZMTMMzMMDQy.jpg width w\" layout\"intrinsic\" class\"i-amphtml-layout-intrinsic i-amphtml-layout-size-defined\" i-amphtml-layout\"intrinsic\" stars as Buddy and Jamie Dornan stars as Pa in director Kenneth Branaghs Belfast.PIC:PA Photo Rob Youngson Focus Features.\" fallback layout\"responsive\" \"\" width\"\" src\" img placeholder.png\" class\"i-amphtml-layout-responsive i-amphtml-layout-size-defined\" i-amphtml-layout\"responsive\"Jude Hillstars as Buddy and Jamie Dornan stars as Pa in director Kenneth Branaghs Belfast.

It couldn’t be more personal really, to be able to tell the story.“I left at , Caitriona left at , not to avoid the beginning of a war, but we all did for dferent reasons, and I understand what that means. And I’ve also spent  years going around the world, telling people I’m from Belfast and seeing all kinds of reactions to just that.“And I think this film can help to settle some of the ideas that people have about that place and the people in my place, because we get to see it through the eyes of a normal family and that’s really vital.”Balfe, , who was born in Dublin and grew up right on the border, added: “When I read the script one of the things that impacted upon me was just the compassion and the empathy Ken had for this ordinary working class family who had not asked for this. “We’ve seen many great films about the Troubles, but there’s been an absence of films just about the everyday family, who sort of got caught up among it.”From North Belfast to RADA and playing the great DaneSir Kenneth Charles Branagh was born on December , and trained at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London where he has served as president since . He has been nominated for five Academy Awards, as well as having won three BAFTAs, two Emmy Awards and a Golden Globe Award. Ken was knighted on November ,  and was made a Freeman of Belfast in January . In , he was listed at number  on Thelist of Ireland’s greatest film actors.Branagh has both directed and starred in several film adaptations of William Shakespeare’s plays, including Othello , and most notably Hamletwherein he played the tormented Dane and delivered the lapidary ‘To be or not to be’ speech with perhaps more fervour than any actor before or since. He was nominated for Academy Awards for Best Actor and Best Director for Henry V and for Best Adapted Screenplay for Hamlet.He has starred in innumerable television series and films including Mary Shelly’s Frankenstein , Wallanderand Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets .‘Overnight our street was turned into a war zone’ recalls Branagh of By Joanne SavageKenneth Branagh’s older brother Bill told Ann Ferran of The Sunday Times in : “Ken was a regular little boy growing up in Belfast, who played football in the street. When my father went away he’d bring us back a little matchbox car. I used to keep mine pristine clean, but Ken used to take the tyres off his.”In the same illuminating article, Ken said of the place where he grew up: “The area was predominantly Protestant, but there was a smattering of Catholics. Everybody got on. There was a real sense of community. “We had a large extended family. “Le in Belfast was very grounded and family-orientated, and Bill and I were thrown together - we shared a bed. I remember being in bed next to him, and whichever book he wasn’t reading for school I’d pick up. So I was introduced to Shakespeare through him. “The cardinal sin back in Belfast was to show off or make a fuss. ‘Don’t have any ideas above your station.’ That was my parents’ philosophy. “To them, money was only important for putting a roof over your head it wasn’t an end in itself. And a person’s religion made no dference to my parents, though not everyone in Belfast shared that view. “My Dad was a Protestant, but he was never in the Orange Order.”Sir Ken continued: “My mother had just got pregnant with my sister when things became quite intense in Belfast. One night Bill came running up our street saying: “Get in the house!” We heard a terrible buzzing noise. “I saw a sort of cloud at the bottom of the street, which turned out to be a huge bomb. “Bill pushed Mum and me under a table in the back room. We didn’t know it then, but it was the mob outside, who were picking up the iron gratings from the drains at the side of the roads and throwing them through the windows of the Catholic houses. “Hours later, there were barricades at the top and bottom of the street, while the men ided themselves into vigilante groups. “Our street had turned into a war zone overnight.“In the wake of that, my parents felt uneasy about Belfast. My father, who was a joiner, had been offered a job in England, at a management level, and they decided to take the opportunity.” Branagh added: “The move to England felt at times like some kind of betrayal. The transformation from that very grounded Belfast le, with its comfortable and simple expectations, had a profound effect on me. “I feel that only now do I have a strong sense of who I am in the way that I did in Belfast. “Today I’m less conflicted and guilt-ridden. And, believe me, Jews and Catholics don’t have a monopoly on guilt. “The Protestant work ethic was branded on my forehead:you are fit and talented it is your duty to use it.” Heartfelt tribute to a city with spirit defiantly undimmedFILM REVIEW: BELFASTBy Joanne SavageThis superbly directed film, shot in elegant monochrome, is a nostalgic and fiercely affectionate paean to a city that shaped its director in his heart and soul. Buddy, played by the adorable and wide-eyed Jude Hill, is a double for the young Ken, who, while crushing on the smartest girl in his class, and simply wanting to enjoy trips to the cinema to see Chitty Chitty Bang Bang and play in the street with a fake sword and a bin lid, struggles to understand why violence breaks out so suddenly and inexplicably, as he looks up with wonder at his Pa, played masterfully and with real sensitivity by Jamie Dornan, who refuses to be drawn into the persecution of his Catholic neighbours, and emerges as the moral centre of the piece, alongside Caitriona Balfe’s stoical and beautul Ma.Ciaran Hinds and Judi Dench are profoundly affecting as Buddy’s grandparents, full of earthy, Ulsterish wit and tenderness, even as the community outside their humble terraced abode becomes mired in internecine stre.The warmth and humour shared among the family at epicentre of the film stands in stark contrast to the street vigilantes who will no longer tolerate the Catholics among them.There is a wonderful moment where Popis helping Buddy with his maths homework. Pop, ailing in health, tells him to make his answers blurry, to keep the teacher guessing, he might get marked up or down, but does he want to impress his would-be classroom sweetheart or not  Still, Buddy wants to know the right answer. “If there were a right answer son, and we all knew it, would they be doing what they’re doing out there ” muses Pop. Some may find Branagh’s liberally applied doses of sugar to a narrative about the birth of Belfastian tragedy something of a sentimental gloss over the true horrors of , but actually what the much vaunted director achieves here is heroic and defiant: as those who chose violence raged, le still found a way, love triumphed over hatred in most homes and nothing could blot out the fundamental spirit of the right-thinking members of both communities. We’ve all seen gritty films about the Troubles that besieged Belfast, but what Branagh is really saying is that through the eyes of a young boy living with a loving family who protected him, it was still shot through with magic, wonder and people who did not care about who was Catholic or Protestant or neither.Certainly Dornan’s Pa tells Buddy that it doesn’t matterthe girl he loves is a “Catholic or a Hindu or a vegetarian Antichrist” because Everlasting Loveis a flame unextinguished, indeed, as Morrissey might say, a light that never goes out.RATING:  Belfast is in cinemas now."},{"url":null,"title":"edwin poots begins attempt to switch constituency for stormont election ","story":"Tim McGarry: Sorry Sir Kenny, but no-one was called Buddy in Belfast in    Policing Board don’t see intelligence on IRA ‘due to Sinn Fein plea’ says former top PSNI officerNewsLatestTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats OnThings To DoArts and EntertainmentNightleRetroLestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensHomes and GardensCoronaviruse-PaperFarmingRecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPuzzlesPublic NoticesFree Happy AdsNewsPoliticsEdwin Poots begins attempt to switch constituency for Stormont electionFormer DUP leader Edwin Poots will try to switch constituencies in the forthcoming Northern Ireland Assembly elections.By Jonathan McCambridge and Mark RaineyFriday, th January , : pmUpdated Friday, th January , : pm  \"       \"  Former DUP leader Edwin Poots.

They say that the beach is a sand and shingle beach and has a reputation for being one of the cleanest in the region. There is a coastal walk, chance to go fishing, surfing and views of Tusker Rock.For those owners who may not yet have ventured to the beach with their pups or are concerned about behaviour while at the beach, Wood Green’s dog behaviour and training specialist, Wendy Kruger, has provided some tips to prepare your dog for the beach.• Ensure your dog’s microchip and collar tag details are up to date – just in case.• Get used to checking ground surface temperatures before you take your dog out, as dry sand can be too hot for dogs’ paws on sunny days. To check the ground temperature, place the back of your hand on the ground. If its too hot to hold comfortably for five seconds, it’s too hot for dogs’ paws..remove• Practise basic, reward-based training when out and about to help your dog to maintain focus and engagement on walks.• Recall is also an area that needs particular attention. Evenyour dog has a great recall at home, its not something that can be guaranteed in unfamiliar environments with exciting new distractions. Games with toys are a fantastic way to help your dog engage with you when there are other distractions around. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

On Monday, January , the council’s cabinet signed off plans to consult the public on its plan to introduce the nursery places.Cllr Ben Gray, cabinet member for social care and health, said: “This school needs to be replaced — it’s clearly a building which is not fit for purpose. It’s really important that this moves forward and St Nicholas gets a primary school which is fit for purpose.”The new school would be built on the current site, just north of the main building. The main building would then be demolished, and the space used for car parking and spaces for parents and carers who drive to drop off their children, addressing existing congestion issues. The school would still be just a short walk away from the village’s church.According to a recent cabinet report, the current school buildings have “major defects”, with an estimated maintenance backlog of £,, adversely affecting teaching. The school has also faced issues with sinkholes and radon gas. Reception pupils have to walk to the nearby Old School building after morning assembly, along a road without pavement.Demand for local nursery places is growing, with new housing estates recently built in St Nicholas and Bonvilston, and permission for  more houses east of St Nicholas and  east of Bonvilston..removeBut the cabinet decided it would be too expensive to find an alternative site for building a replacement school twice the size of the current one, and instead chose to put forward the new plan for a school with  places and  nursery places. Refurbishing the current buildings was also seen as too tricky given the condition of the buildings and parking issues.Cllr Lis Burnett, cabinet member for education, said: “The school wanted to stay where it is. It is a Church in Wales school and they felt that their connection to the church was very important. The buildings would be very dficult to refurbish — they’re not up to scratch and it would be very dficult to retrofit them and to fit in a nursery.”The council’s planning committee has not yet granted permission for the replacement school building. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Following a trip to Belfast from where we were staying in Omagh, we made a stop at Sprucefield, where my husband offered to dispose of the litter – which included the plastic bag, without realising its contents.”Pictured with the jewellery are Danny McErlain, Operations Manager at RiverRidge and Vytautus Skurdauskis.It wasn’t until Kathleen went looking for her jewellery the following morning that she realised it wasn’t in the car. After a frantic search, the couple realised that the jewellery had been thrown out during their stop at Sprucefield.Kathleen continued: “When we realised what had happened, we drove back to Sprucefield to seethere was any chance of retrieving the jewellery but as expected, the bins had been emptied. At this stage, I had lost all hope of ever being reunited with my jewellery collection again.” Staff at Sprucefield helped Kathleen get in touch with the team at RiverRidge.RiverRidge collect waste from all parts of Northern Ireland. In most instances, all waste is processed on the day of collection at one of the company’s three Materials Recovery Facilities, so it is very rare to find anything that someone mistakenly throws away.Senior Commercial Manager at RiverRidge, Pamela Jordan explained: “When I received Kathleen’s email on Monday morning, I knew how distressing this must have been for her. However, given the nature of our business and the large amount of waste we collect, we were unsure about what the outcome would be.“We always try to accommodate as best we can though, and after contacting our Operations Manager at the Mallusk facility, Danny McErlain, the team got to work – literally on their hands and knees seeingany of the jewellery could be recovered.”At this point, Kathleen and Eric had arrived at the ferry port, and were waiting to board the boat for theirto Scotland, resigned to the fact that the jewellery was gone. She said: “I had accepted that the jewellery was lost, and I was devastated. That was until, like ine intervention, I received a call from Pamela telling me that the plastic bag containing my jewellery had been found. I couldn’t believe it, I was elated.“I am so grateful to everyone who helped out along the way – from the team at Sprucefield, to Pamela, and all the team at RiverRidge who went above and beyond to retrieve the jewellery.
