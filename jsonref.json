Perhaps she did not want to.\u0027I felt I needed stay with her and that she needed me. I asked her if she wanted me to stay and she said \u0027yes\u0027.\u0027I am glad I did - even if it was only to offer her a little support.\u0027The fact that she did not hand the phone to anyone else showed to me that she needed it.\u0027Ms Russell advised the \u0027very scared\u0027 12-year-old to go to the room least affected by smoke, shut the windows, stay low and cover her mouth.She went on: \u0027After about an hour I could not get anymore response from her - only rasping sounds, then nothing.\u0027I stayed on the line a little while longer with my hand hovered over the call termination button.          Heartache: Jessica\u0027s family, pictured, handed out posters of her in the days after the fire as they initially believed she was missing\u0027I was torn as what best to do. I eventually ended the call when the line fell silent.\u0027Reflecting on that call, I felt completely helpless.\u0027When people are pleading with you, saying do not want to die and I cannot physically do anything to help them it is very hard.\u0027I can pass on all the information but I cannot actually do anything - that is very tough.\u0027The information that Jessica had fled to a higher floor was not passed on to fire crews on the ground, who searched her flat but found no trace of the youngster. Ms Russell revealed that, not long after the call ended, she became aware that the advice to callers had been changed from \u0027stay-put\u0027 to attempt to evacuate.She said she did not recall ringing previous callers back with the changed advice, just answering the \u0027relentless\u0027 calls and updating new callers.                            It went eerily quiet and a little creepy. I remember someone saying, \u0027I wish they\u0027d call again\u0027                        There was a lull in the calls at around 5am, Ms Russell said, recalling the words of a fellow operator.She said: \u0027It went eerily quiet and a little creepy. I remember someone saying, \u0027I wish they\u0027d call again\u0027.\u0027That way we would have known that they were still alive.\u0027Jessica was one of 72 people who died following the blaze on June 14 last year.Her remains were found on the 23rd floor of the 24-storey block, an inquest heard last year. She was identified by dental records and the preliminary cause of death was given as \u0027consistent with the effects of fire\u0027.The 12-year-old became one of the best-known faces of the disaster after relatives plastered missing posters bearing her photograph around North Kensington in the days after the fire. Initially it was not known whether or not Jessica was still alive, due to confusion about the fact she wasn\u0027t in her flat on the 20th floor.  Family and friends, many wearing T-shirts saying \u0027Happy birthday Jessie\u0027, released balloons to mark what would have been her 13th birthday on 4 July.  Call operators managed to save 60 Grenfell residents  More than 60 residents trapped in Grenfell Tower were saved as a result of 999 call information passed from the control room to fire crews, an assistant manager said.Alexandra Norman spent a \u0027traumatic\u0027 shift in the London Fire Brigade\u0027s control room, where she said operators abandoned normal policy in order to take as many calls as possible.The assistant operations manager said she was told that more than 60 people were rescued due to crucial information passed to the command unit on the ground.She only found this out after the fire, describing the lack of updates from the scene as \u0027frustrating\u0027.The control room received 344 emergency calls relating to Grenfell Tower, the public inquiry into the disaster previously heard.    Inferno: An inquiry is currently underway after the Grenfell Tower fire caused devastation last yearBetween 1.20am and 2am the volume of calls became \u0027overwhelming\u0027 and \u0027all hell broke loose\u0027, Ms Norman said in a written statement to the inquiry.She said: \u0027I was still thinking to myself \u0027What the hell is going on\u0027 and the information was coming through so quickly that we were unable to process it.\u0027I had never known a fire to spread so quickly. There was no information from the crews on the ground.\u0027She added: \u0027Control room officers normally stay on the phone for FSG (fire survival guidance) calls but my staff just couldn\u0027t stay on the phone for that long, so we had to be efficient in giving advice, then move onto the next call as we had people waiting.\u0027We couldn\u0027t follow the policy in these circumstances and there is no amount of training that would have prepared anybody for that.\u0027At just after 2.45am, she was told by a senior manager that advice had changed and callers should now be told to get out of the building.She wrote this on a piece of paper which she showed to phone operators who were busy taking calls.\u0027My feeling about this decision was that it should have been made sooner,\u0027 she said.  "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/18/17/4E5DE3EB00000578-5966769-Featuring_seven_bedrooms_and_a_helipad_this_property_would_suit_-m-114_1531930246521.jpg","title":"Hidden away riverside home helipad sale 4m","story":"    The numerous rooms in the mansion give the occupants stunning views over the River Dart as it sits on its own peninsula.

Now she is in custody in Washington D.C. charged with illegally interfering in the election          Anna Chapman was arrested in 2010 on charges of being a Russian spy.

She poses with toy pistols while you are being published with real ones.\u0027Butina worked as an assistant to Torshin, the deputy governor of the Central Bank of Russia. Chapman was arrested as part of the infamous 2010 Russian spy ring. She pleaded guilty to a charge of conspiracy to act as an agent of a foreign government and was deported to Russia in July 2010.The comparisons between the two red-haired beauties was inevitable.  In addition to having her bags packed, prosecutors feared she had the funds to flee. Butina, who was indicted on Tuesday by a grand jury in Washington, D.C., has \u0027access to funds and an intention to move money outside the United States,\u0027 prosecutors note.They also point out her lease was up at the end of July and she had boxes packed.Prosecutors suspect she would have appealed to President Vladimir Putin\u0027s government to help her leave the United States. They wrote: \u0027Because Butina has been exposed as an illegal agent of Russia, there is the grave risk that she will appeal to those within that government with whom she conspired to aid her escape from the United States.\u0027 Batina, 29, was charged over the weekend, the day after the Justice Department announced an indictment against 12 Russian intelligence officers for allegedly conspiring to hack the Democratic National Committee during the 2016 presidential election.Law enforcement officials became concerned that Butina appeared to be preparing to flee in the wake of the announcement and decided to make an arrest,  people familiar with the case told The Washington Post.Batina\u0027s attorney told NPR the charges are overblown.          Explosive: The arrest and charging of a Russian over allegations of election meddling was on the day that Trump said that he didn\u0027t \u0027see any reason why\u0027 Putin would have interfered in the poll          Butina, seen in the orange jump suit in this courtroom sketch, was in court on Wednesday where a judge ruled she must stay behind bars  Inevitable comparison: The arrest and charges of Butina led to comparisons with Anna Chapman, the red-headed Russian \u0027sleeper\u0027 arrested in New York in 2010, who pleaded guilty to a charge of conspiracy and was send to Russian in a spy exchange.The U.S. government was concerned Butina has been in contact with Russia\u0027s FSB intelligence agency \u0027throughout her entire time\u0027 in the United States, according to court papers. Among documents uncovered in her apartment after her arrest was a \u0027hand-written\u0027 note asking, \u0027How to respond to FSB offer of employment?\u0027 the Justice Department said in a court filing, according to the Daily Beast.  The FSB is the successor to the Soviet-era KGB.Butina entered the country on a student visa in August 2016. The court filings also said that she has ties to wealthy businessmen in the Russian oligarchy.Butina was arrested and charged over the weekend with conspiracy to act as an agent of the Russian government while developing ties with U.S. citizens and infiltrating political groups, the Justice Department said on Monday.It is unclear if the arrest and indictment was a result of special counsel Robert Mueller\u0027s probe into allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 election.          Business arrangement: Butina started a business with ex-Trump adviser Paul EricksonButina was reported by the New York Times in 2017 to have been part of an attempt to broker a meeting between Putin and Donald Trump.The offer was rejected by Jared Kushner. Butina was alleged to have acted from 2015 to 2016 as an unregistered foreign agent on the orders of an unnamed senior Russian official - meaning that the Justice Department\u0027s indictment accuses Putin\u0027s government of election meddling.Butina, a fiery red-haired Russian gun activist who founded the Right to Bear Arms, the Russian equivalent of the NRA, is the first Russian held by law enforcement since the election.Others have been indicted but remain in Russia, and no extraditions have been formally requested. The indictment did not name the organizations and citizens Butina is alleged to have targeted - but the NRA is clearly one of them.According to court papers, Butina met with U.S. politicians and candidates, attended events sponsored by special interest groups - including two National Prayer Breakfast events - and organized Russian-American \u0027friendship and dialogue\u0027 dinners in Washington with the goal of \u0027reporting back to Moscow\u0027 what she had learned.Court papers do not name the Kremlin official. The person is described as a member of the Russian legislature who later became a top official in the country\u0027s central bank. Prosecutors also note that the official has since been sanctioned by the U.S.Butina is a Russian gun rights advocate who founded a pro-gun organization in that country, the Right to Bear Arms, in 2011 and who has been involved in coordinating in recent years between American gun rights activists and their Russian counterparts, U.S. media accounts have reported.Butina hosted several leading NRA executives and pro-gun conservatives at her group\u0027s annual meeting in 2015, according to the reports in The New York Times, Time and the Daily Beast.   Maria Butina allegedly worked at the direction of a high-level official in the Russian government who has been sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury\u0027s Office of Foreign Assets Control, the Justice Department said in a statement. She lead a Russian gun rights group - and then allegedly infiltrated the NRA          Butina tried to arrange a meeting between Trump, when he was a candidate, and PutinAmong those who attended were former NRA President David Keene, conservative political operative Paul Erickson and former Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clarke, later a strong Trump supporter. However in May, Senate Democrats on the Judiciary Committee demanded that Butina be put in front of them over claims she was part of a Russian scheme to support Trump by giving money to the NRA - one of his most vocal backers. \u0027The Committee has obtained a number of documents that suggest the Kremlin used the National Rifle Association as a means of accessing and assisting Mr. Trump and his campaign,\u0027 Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee said in a release that outlined their preliminary findings in their investigation of potential Russian influence on the election.It is illegal for foreign money to be used to influence federal elections.Trump has close ties to the NRA. The pro-gun group endorsed him early in his campaign and the president repaid that loyalty with two successive appearances at its national convention, the most recent in May.Butina traveled to NRA events and posted photos to her social media accounts of her holding guns. She has also started a business with former Trump adviser Paul Erickson.Both Butina and Torshin have \u0027longstanding ties\u0027 to former NRA president David Keene.The Democrats also charge that during the 2016 election, Torshin, Butina and their intermediaries \u0027repeatedly offered\u0027 the Trump campaign back channels to Russia and relayed requests from Russian President Vladimir Putin to meet with Trump. \u0027The extent of Russia\u0027s use of the NRA as an avenue for connecting with and potentially supporting the Trump campaign needs examination,\u0027 the Democrats said, adding that Butina, Torshin and Erickson \u0027have refused to cooperate.\u0027 Judge orders alleged Russian agent to remain in custody | TheHill"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/26/21/4B951D4F00000578-0-image-a-55_1524773032505.jpg","title":"Yes means yes New Spanish law silence means no","story":"    Jose Angel Prenda, Jesus Cabezuelo, Jesus Escudero, Angel Boza and Antonio Manuel Guerrero were dubbed the \u0027Wolf Pack\u0027.

There wasn’t really any impact to boaters or wildlife that we are aware of.‘We managed to fill the canal up fairly quickly and the fish either swam further down the canal with the flow of water or remained in the pool of water left behind.’ The lock paddles were also left open in 2011 and ‘small fish were stranded in the muddy puddles left behind as the water receded’, according to passer-by Timothy Hiss.The Kennet and Avon Canal is an 87-mile waterway linking the River Thames at Reading to the River Avon in Bath.It was originally opened in 1810, but gradually fell into decline after the Great Western Railway was built.The waterway was completely restored by volunteers and officially reopened by the Queen in August 1990. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/18/23/4E62593000000578-5968353-The_54_year_old_tied_the_knot_with_Amiko_Kauderer_44_in_their_ho-m-26_1531952753103.jpg","title":"Astronaut Scott Kelly marries long time girlfriend","story":"    Astronaut Scott Kelly married his long-time girlfriend Amiko Kauderer in Houston, Texas last weekend after she stood by him when he spent a record-breaking year away in space\u0027We were very honored to have (Houston Mayor) Sylvester Turner officiate our wedding here in our hometown Houstin, Texas overlooking Discovery Green last weekend.

The singer was having lunch at his Algarve retreat in August 2014 when the police raided his luxury apartmentThe ramifications of that dramatic raid on August 14, 2014, are still being felt today. But the sorry saga started two months earlier when BBC reporter Dan Johnson received a tip-off from a confidential source.It was at the height of Operation Yewtree, the extraordinary Metropolitan Police investigation into a string of celebrities following the Jimmy Savile scandal.A junior but ambitious reporter, Mr Johnson said his tipster had revealed there was ‘one more high profile person being investigated’. The reference was oblique, but the journalist guessed correctly it was Sir Cliff. And when the source told Mr Johnson, whose BBC patch is the north of England, that the investigation was ‘closer to home’, he also worked out it involved South Yorkshire Police.Although Mr Johnson never named his source, the court ruled yesterday it was most probably either a police officer from the Yewtree inquiry or someone associated with the police.The reporter was on the trail of what his boss called a ‘bloody cracking’ scoop – but he was described by the judge as ‘capable of letting his enthusiasm for his story get the better of his complete regard for truth’.‘BLACKMAILING’ THE POLICEOn July 9, armed with his sensational tip, Mr Johnson spoke on the phone to South Yorkshire Police’s head of communications, Carrie Goodwin. When he casually asked whether Sir Cliff was ‘on their radar’, she gave ‘an audible gasp’, he told the court.          Police officers search the property of pop star Sir Cliff Richards in Sunningdale, Berkshire in August 2014. Sir Cliff watched the breaking news Miss Goodwin, who had been privately briefed about the highly sensitive investigation by police chiefs, remarked that he had good sources, claimed Mr Johnson.Miss Goodwin told Matthew Fenwick, the detective superintendent leading the investigation, and chief constable David Crompton. The police say they decided to co-operate with the BBC to avoid the story being broadcast and tipping off their suspect before they were ready to swoop on his home.They invited Mr Johnson in for a meeting. At 1pm on July 15, he met Miss Goodwin and Mr Fenwick – and their discussion is hotly contested.The reporter claimed police voluntarily gave him information about their investigation, confirming it involved a 13-year-old boy allegedly sexually assaulted in a dressing room after a Billy Graham event in Sheffield in the 1980s.But the force said Mr Johnson already knew these details and used them to ‘blackmail’ police into giving the BBC advance notice of their raid on Sir Cliff’s apartment.Either way, a deal was struck. Miss Goodwin said the police would give Mr Johnson the date and location of the search if he agreed not to broadcast the information in advance.EXCITEMENT AT THE BBCJubilant that his ‘tactics’ had worked, Mr Johnson told his BBC editor Declan Wilson, who passed it on to his own boss, Gary Smith, with an email entitled: ‘Sit down when you read this.’In reply, Mr Smith quoted from Sir Cliff’s 1968 Eurovision Song Contest entry by saying: ‘Congratulations. And jubilations. I want the world to know I’m happy as can be.’ Mr Wilson claimed police had even considered arresting tennis fan Sir Cliff at Wimbledon, adding: ‘Off record, they want the publicity as they believe there are others.’          A very emotional looking Sir Cliff Richard seen leaving the High Court after winning his battle with the BBC. The judge said: ‘Excitement was being created in the BBC over the prospect of the story.’ When Mr Johnson was asked by his boss how he had managed to persuade the police, he said he had got detectives ‘over a barrel because of the tip-off I had received’.On the evening of August 13, police stuck to their deal and gave the journalist the details he needed. They even emailed him an aerial photo of the apartment block.The BBC machine swung into action. Camera teams were dispatched to the apartment in Berkshire, police HQ in Sheffield, Sir Cliff’s home in the Algarve and his other home in Barbados. And that helicopter was fired up.Mr Smith, the BBC’s UK news editor, wrote in a gleeful email: ‘The money shots will be police going in and out of his flat and loading bags of hard drives or whatever into their vans. We can only get this from the helicopter.’BBC BEAT POLICE TO THE DOOROn the morning of August 14, Operation Kaddie was launched – and hapless police found the BBC were already there.Mr Johnson and two other reporters and their crews had set up camera angles well before 9am, ready to cover the drama live. As the helicopter hovered overhead, a police press officer updated Mr Johnson with text messages.Woman \u0027saw a black Mercedes like the one owned by Borce...Share this articleIn five cars, eight police officers entered the gated estate at 9.35am. They spoke to a building manager who phoned Sir Cliff in Portugal to tell him police had arrived with a warrant to search his home. Sir Cliff later told how, as a decent, law-abiding citizen, all he thought was that he must help the police and instructed the manager to ‘Please let them in’.Police entered the apartment at 10.40am, and three minutes later Mr Johnson was informed by text.From the camera in the helicopter, officers were filmed going through the singer’s possessions. And on the ground, an officer read a prepared statement to a BBC crew. By now, Sir Cliff’s lawyers had been alerted too and were racing to the scene.A ‘HUDDLE’ IN THE NEWSROOMIn the BBC newsroom at 12.15pm, managers held a ‘huddle’ to discuss their scoop and whether to name Sir Cliff, even though police had not. The go-ahead was given by deputy director of news Fran Unsworth, who considered it ‘strongly’ in the public interest.At 1pm the BBC unveiled its ‘top story this lunchtime’ along with dramatic footage of the police raid.          News helicopter images of police arriving to search the Berkshire property belonging to Sir Cliff Richard in relation to an alleged historical sex offence. The ‘vile’ allegations hung over him for almost two years until the police dropped the case without any charges The broadcast went live to Mr Johnson outside the property, and he continued his breathless reports on the BBC News Channel all afternoon. In total there were 44 BBC TV broadcasts that afternoon, with Sir Cliff’s strenuous denials added to the reports from 2pm.A BBC editor, Richard Clark, sent Mr Johnson a congratulatory email saying: ‘Good work, Dan. Well done.’ The reporter replied it was ‘old-fashioned journalism’.But by the evening, an explosive row was brewing.THE FALLOUTOn Radio 4’s Six O’Clock News, respected home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw suggested the BBC’s tip-off had been an ‘attempt by the police to ensure maximum coverage’ of the raid.South Yorkshire Police responded angrily, saying they had not tipped off Mr Johnson, who had ‘blackmailed’ them. Press chief Miss Goodwin complained to him: ‘This wasn’t the case and brings the force into disrepute.’She wrote to her chief constable: ‘It’s wildly inaccurate. The Met leaked it and we asked the BBC not to run it.’ As police prepared an explosive press release claiming the BBC had been fed the tip by Operation Yewtree, Mr Johnson, knowing his tip-off had come from someone outside South Yorkshire Police, begged his superiors to put out a correction to the Danny Shaw report.

However, authors contrasted the figures with a long-term decline in pay and investment in writers, particularly those yet to have a breakout bestseller. The author of Girl With a Pearl Earring, Tracy Chevalier, said: “Authors have seen their earnings chipped away at while publishers thrive.“Most writers cobble together a living from several sources: teaching, journalism, and odd-jobs. Writing is just one shrinking source of income. Shrink it enough and people will stop writing altogether. It literally won’t be worth it.”Chevalier, who is also the president of the Royal Literary Fund, which supports writers in financial difficulty, said that while publishers’ turnover had risen, the charity had noted an increase in applications for hardship grants from younger writers. She said it reflected publishers’ hesitancy to take a risk and support an author for more than one or two books at a time. “I think writers starting out are getting less support from publishers – not just financial, but a commitment to develop them and see them through several books to build up a readership and steady sales,” she said.Joanne Harris, the author of Chocolat, agreed: “I am concerned that publishers don’t seem to be able to see beyond the next big blockbuster book by a white, American male in his mid-60s.”She criticised the funnelling of funds towards celebrity and social media stars, which often failed to translate into sales. “Brooklyn Beckham received a huge advance for a £50 coffee table book of photographs that did not sell,” she said. “Authors are being sacrificed for ‘wish-upon-a-star celebrity’ publishing.”The writer and critic Philip Womack also attacked the investment in celebrity authors. “When David Walliams’ last book came out they sent him on a helicopter tour of Britain, which strikes me as very extravagant when they could have used that money to give more support for debut and established children’s authors,” he said.Nicola Solomon, the chief executive of the Society of Authors, hailed the figures as “excellent news for authors and for wider society”. She said she was concerned that publishers were investing in a shrinking pool of established writers and celebrities.As a result, authors on the verge of success may never reach it, she said, pointing to the children’s author Geraldine McCaughrean, who was dropped after disappointing sales but has since won the Carnegie medal. “Publishers are acquiring lots of authors, but not always really investing in what they acquire, especially when they haven’t paid a fortune to acquire them,” Solomon said.Lotinga denied authors were getting a smaller slice of the publishing cake. “I do not think that incomes are going down,” he said. However, he admitted publishers were hard-pressed to resist demands from retailers, especially supermarkets and online booksellers, in return for promoting inidual titles. “Clearly when you are operating in a world, where very large retailers are able to dictate prices in a massive sector, it is hard to fight,” he said.In part, the failure to match profits with turnover has been laid at the feet of retailers, particularly Amazon, which holds a near-monopoly of online bookselling. One author, who asked not to be named, accused Amazon of using its power to keep book prices artificially low, which had undermined authors’ incomes. “It’s Amazon’s fault entirely that book prices have not increased in the last 20 years,” he said, and referred to his first bestseller. “It was sold at £25 20 years ago and my latest book is also to be sold at the same price, which, in real terms, is a drastic cut.” When the author asked his publisher why prices hadn’t changed, his publisher said it was to ensure support from the online bookselling giant."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/47350edb3d8b2bfbf0b4a191e69b47232bd73e4b/0_72_4766_2860/master/4766.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=44f03f1dc1601361352ca49a7368e57d","title":"hard right left centre party politics blair clinton","story":"In both Britain and the United States, the resurgent left represents the best antidote to inequality, stagnating living standards and insecure employment. Yet it is increasingly clear that if the movements represented chiefly by Jeremy Corbyn and Bernie Sanders fail, it will be the authoritarian xenophobic right that will fill the vacuum.In the growing turmoil on both sides of the Atlantic, the old politics of Blairite and Clintonian centrism have no answers to a popular desire to break with a rotten social order. They have maintained a degree of influence not because they represent a massive constituency of public opinion, but because of long-established networks in their respective political parties, in the media and among economic elites. They are incapable of defeating the rightwing populism that menaces both nations: that mission, the outcome of which is uncertain, falls to the left.Consider our respective political plights. A hard-right plutocrat is the most powerful man on Earth: a man who calls white supremacists “very fine people”, who demanded a total ban on Muslims entering the US, who separated crying children from their parents and locked them in cages, and has adopted far-right tropes about Europe “losing its culture” because of immigration. His elevation to the presidency was deemed a laughable impossibility: the Clinton camp reacted with “giddy disbelief” when he became the Republican frontrunner in early 2016.Yes, Clinton suffered misogyny, and Russia undoubtedly preferred Trump and acted on it: yet the latter factor has become a Clintonian comfort blanket, a means to avoid a post mortem on the politics of the Democratic failure. As veteran Democratic Representative Barbara Lee told me just after Donald Trump’s “American carnage” inauguration speech, there was no shortage of political mobilisation against Trump in the US election: “What I didn’t see in there was the clarity of what our platform was.” Indeed, as a prominent US progressive campaigner, Ben Wikler, put it: “If you ask people what Hillary Clinton’s platform was, they couldn’t tell you … If you asked people what Donald Trump’s platform was, everyone could tell you.”A Democratic campaign founded on economic populism could have defeated Trump, but Clinton did not believe in it, and was beholden to vested economic interests who would have suffered because of it.A leftwing insurgency is undoubtedly making inroads against the Democratic party establishment. The triumph of a 28-year-old socialist, Alexandria Ocasia-Cortez – who defeated a party establishment kingpin, Joe Crowley, in a New York primary – was one striking example, and self-declared socialists have won from Virginia to Pennsylvania. New movements such as the Justice Democrats and Our Revolution are helping to catapult progressive candidates into elected office. But prominent campaigners tell me that the Democratic party establishment see the left as a mortal threat: that their desire is for a 2020 presidential candidate with perceived superior personal and moral traits to those of Trump, – someone charming and with supposed integrity, rather than someone who offers a genuine radical political alternative. If they succeed, no lessons will have been learned from 2016, and a Trump re-election beckons – meaning we are not even a quarter of the way through his presidency.Here in Britain, the manner in which the official leave campaign conducted itself in the EU referendum legitimised the xenophobic right. The Tory hard right is in the ascendancy, and a fascist street movement – led by convicted fraudster Tommy Robinson – represents a growing threat. What could be described as a Far-Right International is developing: Trump’s Mussolini-praising former strategist Steve Bannon tours Europe meeting politicians including Tory hard Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg, while wealthy “alt right” extremists in the US are set to plough financial resources into the resurgent British far right.Unlike the US, the left has assumed the leadership of the Labour party. In 2015, Labour was heading for political oblivion, suffering one of its worst postwar defeats and splintering in three different directions: to the civic nationalists of the SNP, the xenophobic right of Ukip, and the more radical Green party. Corbynism could not secure victory for Labour within two years of this rout, but saved the party from going the way of the German Social Democrats and the French Socialists.And yet. Chatter abounds of either a national government – floated openly by Tory remainers, privately by a small grouping of Labour MPs – or a new “centrist” party. If I was a hard-right strategist, I would be aching for either option. The former would mean a stitch-up of politicians to form a government no one voted for, united around reversing a referendum result: vindication of the right’s narrative of betrayal.For the politics of a new “centrist” party, look no further than Anna Soubry: a Tory politician who has not only mostly voted with her party on Brexit, but has voted for the bedroom tax, cuts to disability and low-paid benefits, slashing taxes on the rich and big business, hiking VAT, hammering trade unions, and privatising the NHS and Royal Mail. That would be the politics of a new centrist party: combining social liberalism with policies that favour the rich at the expense of workers and the vulnerable. At its most successful it would simply ide the anti-Tory vote, handing power to a Conservative party de facto led – as Soubry herself says – by Jacob Rees-Mogg.There has been a longstanding myth that political upheaval and crisis belonged to mainland Europe, that radical impulses were somehow alien to British or American political culture. Both nations are now in turmoil because the neoliberal project promised freedom and instead delivered insecurity. Disappearing jobs, creaking public services, a lack of affordable housing: all have led to a widespread desire for a rupture with the old order. The radical right is feeding from this disillusion. Only a left that offers a genuine alternative – to hold powerful vested interests to account, rather than scapegoating migrants and Muslims – can hope to defeat this political poison."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8d97c66a09b5b146dd27f0d7d7c7a540ed5ff0aa/259_465_2191_1315/master/2191.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=646a00620dc965f1b43d8f1da403f6c1","title":"you count your blessings farm families battling drought photo essay","story":"In central-western New South Wales some families on the land are facing ruin as the rain stays awayby Brook Mitchell and  Lisa CoxDoolan and his wife, Lisa, run 9,000 acres with Angus cattle outside of the town on their property, Toorawandi. Their son Mick has followed them into the farming business and has his own property, and their daughter Emily, a town planner, returned home this year to work on the family farm. “What a year to do it,” Doolan says. “My dad didn’t want me to be a farmer and I think this is why. We were a bit the same with our son, we didn’t want him to be a farmer. But you are what you are.” Last year the Doolans recorded their fourth-lowest average rainfall and it has been followed by even drier conditions. They have sold whatever stock they can and spend their entire days at the moment feeding the cattle that remains because the pastures have dried up.Farmers in this part of NSW are importing almost all food for their livestock from as far away as South Australia as prices rise with demand. The continued cost of buying feed is causing many to question their future on the land. The NSW government recently approved an emergency drought relief package of $600m, at least $250m of which will cover low-interest loans to assist eligible farm businesses to recover. The package has been welcomed but, in the words of a local farmer, “it barely touches the sides”. With the prospect of a dry El Niño weather pattern hitting the state in spring, the longer-term outlook is dire.Jess Taylor and her husband, Robert, are fourth-generation farmers, running a mixed sheep and cattle farm 25km north-west of Coonabarabran. They are raising four children, two not yet in school, while dealing with the stress of nearly two years without substantial rain. Bills from trucking in food for their sheep and cattle are running as high as $20,000 a month. Robert left the property recently to take up shearing work to bring in much-needed cash, leaving Jess to manage the farm and care for their children on her own. “There’s just no income. Whatever the farm is making is going back into feed for whatever we have left,” she says. “It’s hard, it’s hard to know what to do.”The family sold their healthier stock last year before the market “took a huge e”, Jess says. The ewes on the property are abandoning their lambs because the dry pastures and lack of food have reduced their ability to produce enough milk. “We’ve got close to 30 orphan lambs that we’re hand-feeding,” Jess says. “We lost quite a few of them in the cold snap that just came through despite doing the best we could for them.” Charities such as Buy a Bale, where people can purchase hay bales for local farmers, have been some assistance. The Taylors’ oldest son, Harry, asked for rain for his sixth birthday. While much of NSW experienced a wet start to winter, the dark skies over Coonabarabran have yet to deliver relief. The Taylors say they will not be taking up the government’s loan, as they are already struggling with considerable debt.The Jerry family, also fourth-generation farmers, run sheep and cattle on their property Maryborough, 40km north-east of Coonabarabran. At the head of the family is Coral Jerry, 80, who lives on the farm alone after her husband of 55 years died in 2015. She is hand-feeding 40 orphaned lambs four to five times a day while her son Greg, his wife, Tanya, and their son Brett manage the farm. Things have become so desperate the Jerrys are mixing expired baby formula with their imported cotton seed to add nutrition for their struggling animals. “It’s a never-ending story at the moment,” Greg says. “Every week there’s a chance of some sort of rain but when it happens it’s usually one or two mils, which does nothing ... We actually got 19 mils the other day, which was beautiful.” He says it would take 100mm of rain to deliver long-term improvement to a property that currently “looks a bit like the surface of the moon”. “Financially, we’re on our borderline now,” he says. “We destocked as much as possible early on as it got worse and worse. But what we’re left with now is pretty much unsaleable in the condition they’re in.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/82bbc7599908289f8b3a5d145974e3ec946bbb45/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=55d48800775a5bb37d6af547cb9890d3 1240w","title":"the dark knight at 10 how christopher nolan reshaped superhero cinema","story":"The legacy of 2008’s dark Batman sequel has been clouded by a string of dour DC missteps and a wider misunderstanding of the film’s groundbreaking grimness Can Christopher Nolan predict the future? Could he have somehow foreseen the eerily specific prescience of Batman’s introduction in 2008’s The Dark Knight, modern superhero cinema’s unwitting blueprint? Christian Bale’s caped crusader doesn’t show his cowled face until a few scenes into the film, after the Joker has pulled off his daring bank heist. Bruce Wayne arrives on the scene to bust up a powwow between some mobsters and guest villain Scarecrow, but he’s preceded by some paunchy copycats armed with shotguns and hockey pads. Their effort to emulate Batman only gets them into trouble, until the genuine article shows up to dispatch the goons with minimal difficulty. Purrs the Scarecrow: “That’s more like it.”The dour, oppressively grey DC Cinematic Universe is likewise littered with cinematic imitators of Nolan’s vision, having learned all the wrong lessons from Batman’s example. Led by chief architect Zack Snyder, the DC Comics adaptations fell in line behind the gargantuan box office success of Nolan’s films by aping his tone in the hopes that that would be sufficient to recreate the magic. And while box office grosses have for the most part remained healthy, the quality of the films themselves has never come close to matching the rigorous precision, popcorn philosophizing, and sheer cinematic verve of the film now celebrating its tenth anniversary. “We’re going to do this forever, aren’t we?” taunts the Joker, near the tail end of The Dark Knight. Little did he know their psychotic pas de deux would be rehashed over and over again.Bolstered by an ambitious script from Nolan, his brother (and, elsewhere, Westworld co-creator) Jonathan, and regular DC Comics scribe David Goyer, The Dark Knight ushered in an age of po-faced seriousness – a look that takes a lot of gravitas to pull off. Breaking from a more sprightly, brightly-colored tradition of comic book films best exemplified by Sam Raimi’s Spider-Man pictures, Nolan nudged the genre in the direction of hard realism. Bale’s Batman doesn’t behave like a valiant defender of the defenseless, rather like a hard-nosed cop unencumbered by legal codes of conduct. The Joker, a role that enshrined Heath Ledger in myth following his untimely passing, is no mere super villain, either. He’s an ideological deviant, referred to at least once in the script directly as a “terrorist”, compelled only by the love of violence and chaos. His agenda is chilling in its indifference he gleefully sets a mountain of money ablaze in full view of the crooks he took it from, just to show them that this is a war fought on principle. He’s the closest thing to nuance that the DC rogues’ gallery has ever seen, and characteristic of a film founded in social theory. The Joker’s grand evil scheme? Sociology thought experiments … made real!With Wonder Woman as the emboldened, upbeat exception along with the wisecracking Flash (Ezra Miller, livening up Justice League every time he appeared onscreen), the recent efforts from the DC camp simply slather on the somberness. They mistake world-weariness for outright pessimism, and aspire to nothing more profound than that most overused of registers: “gritty”. The DC canon has more grit than a sandpaper factory, full of grimacing heroes who would fly into the sun before they allowed themselves to crack a smile. They consider wielding power to be a great and terrible burden, just like Batman, but unlike the brutal vigilante protecting a town that nonetheless loathes him, they’re not supported with the motivation for that jaded viewpoint.More troubling still, DC’s works form the vanguard of a much wider movement towards the homogeneously dark. To varying levels of success, there’s been a mass gritification through Hollywood, affecting everyone from Robin Hood to Universal’s cabal of monster-movie spooks. The Dark Knight’s excellence has been all but boiled down to the single, caveman-simplistic notion that bummer equals mature. Constant flops along the lines of King Arthur: Legend of the Sword have proven otherwise, but this is apparently a lesson that must be learned many times over.While it’s no fair to hold its unruly offspring against The Dark Knight, it’s all the same frustrating that the rich backlog of comic book arcana from the DC catalogue has never been mined with the same thoughtfulness and technical ingenuity. To paraphrase the film’s pensive final monologue: we’ve been given the releases that DC’s bottom line needs, but not the ones that Batman’s memory deserves."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dc85162250c0a35d1559d3100e26376fcc1051b6/652_631_3767_2261/master/3767.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0d24e98071ff69ef1cfc70350ae2f42f","title":"thomas friends big world big adventures the movie review peter andre","story":"There’s new rolling stock on the tracks as Thomas the Tank Engine learns more life lessons, but gender stereotypes remainFor years it was the kids’ programme liberal parents loved to hate – all those male trains burning fossil fuel in that little corner of Ukip paradise, the Isle of Sodor. But the rehabilitation of Thomas the Tank Engine steams ahead with this earnest film featuring lady engines and international friends from the franchise’s new rolling stock. The whole thing has a straight-to-DVD quality, or perhaps a TV episode padded out with a few limp songs. (“I’m free and easy, lemon squeezy, never saying pretty-please-y”.)Once again that noted shirker Thomas is learning life lessons about friendship and keeping your promises, this time getting his wheels burned by a toxic friendship with a devil-may-care Australian racing car, Ace (voiced by Peter Andre). Suffering a serious case of engine envy, Thomas abandons his responsibilities at the station to tag along with Ace on a round-the-world race. First stop is Dakar and then it’s over to the Amazon rainforest (miraculously unspoilt by climate change). Inevitably, reckless Ace leaves Thomas high and dry, while Nia, a female engine from Kenya, turns out to be a better friend – despite Thomas huffily attempting to ditch her at every available opportunity.The overhaul here seems sincere if a little strained, and the franchise deserves some points for unshackling Thomas from the yesteryear universe of creator the Rev Wilbert Awdry, a vicar and railway enthusiast. But the lazy gender stereotypes need to go. Predictably, the super-cool, risk-taking racing car is male while the role of the female engine is to be virtuous and peace-making. And if Thomas really is going to lunge for the zeitgeist, where’s the rail disruption, journey chaos and apoplectic passengers venting their frustration on social media?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/64a4eb14043f3a40cd782930f7373dda8057ad71/0_0_2676_1605/master/2676.jpg?w=1900\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=2f96410c4fba3e4a23912ca4839caaa0 3800w","title":"manchester united tour los angeles","story":"• Raft of Manchester United players missing from training• Fears Sánchez may miss US tour after visa troubleJosé Mourinho has admitted Manchester United’s preparation for the new season is “very bad” because many of his senior players are resting after the World Cup and Alexis Sánchez may miss the club’s entire US tour because of a visa matter.United are in California but Mourinho is without Sánchez, Paul Pogba, Romelu Lukaku, Marouane Fellaini, Marcus Rashford, Jesse Lingard, Marcos Rojo, Victor Lindelöf, Ashley Young, David de Gea, Nemanja Matic, Fred and Phil Jones.De Gea, Matic and Fred are due to join the squad next week before the third tour game against Milan in Los Angeles. Yet Mourinho said: “The pre-season is very bad. The positive thing is only for the young boys that have a fantastic opportunity to train with us.Next week will come De Gea, Matic and Fred which is good, especially for Fred.Mourinho is also without Diogo Dalot, the 19-year-old full-back signed from Porto for £19m, because of injury. The loss of Sánchez is a particular blow because Mourinho aims to field a frontline of the Chilean, Juan Mata and Anthony Martial against Leicester .“It is really bad, really sad, not good for him, for me, the team,” the manager said. “There is no one to blame the club is making the effort. I have to respect the US authorities in their process of visas. But hopefully he joins us later because it could be important to work with Martial, Alexis and Mata – the players we have in attack for start of the season. There is no Lukaku, Lingard or Rashford.”Mourinho was noncommittal regarding any further signings. “I’ve no idea. I’m not going to lie to you, I’m not going to say somebody is coming or nobody is coming.”Pogba was a driving force in France’s World Cup triumph. Mourinho hopes the midfielder can finally replicate that form over a whole season.“I hope he understands why he was very good. That’s the point about his performance level and contribution to a winning team: it is to understand why he was so good especially in the second part of the competition, where he was absolutely brilliant.”“When everyone comes back and everyone is fit and ready, I still want to be that first name on the teamsheet. It’s time for me to show him over the next four weeks what I can do and why I deserve to be in this team.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db395978ad1bef6be6669cfdb44a7f3404226ea4/0_0_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d7191d7d497e289ecf55b6246e348002","title":"france croatia final trophy russia 2018 ends on high world cup football daily","story":"Max and co discuss France’s World Cup final triumph over Croatia, another penalty, another controversial VAR incident, the tournament’s highs and lows and players taking shots to the conkers"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9dc6c43b2f3690e4f58c4d5954dc180996538303/884_0_3946_2368/master/3946.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4e002c2361db653c16eff86ec94ad855","title":"legal aid harder to access since reform says human rights committee","story":"Harriet Harman wants urgent review of ‘legal aid deserts’ that stop people enforcing rightsLegal aid “deserts” have emerged as lawyers withdraw from services that are no longer financially viable leaving many people unable to obtain access to justice, a parliamentary report said.The study by the joint committee on human rights has called for an urgent review of how people can enforce their rights, for changes to the Legal Aid Agency’s exceptional case funding scheme and for more legal support for families at inquests.The MP Harriet Harman, who is the chair of the JCHR, said: “For rights to be effective they have to be capable of being enforced. At the moment we are seeing the erosion of all of those enforcement mechanisms because of a lack of access to justice and lack of understanding of the fundamental importance of human rights and the rule of law. The government must act urgently to address this.”MPs and peers on the committee criticised reforms introduced by the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012 (LASPO) which, they said, “made access to justice more difficult for many, for whom it is simply unaffordable”.The Ministry of Justice has been reviewing the effect of LASPO and has promised to report its findings before the end of the year. “There are large areas of the country which are legal aid deserts as practitioners withdraw from providing legal aid services since they can no longer afford to do this work following reductions in legal aid funding by successive governments over the past three decades,” the JCHR report said.The committee recommended that the financial eligibility criteria for legal aid should be reviewed, possibly aligning it with the criteria for welfare benefits. Under LASPO, for example, all applicants for legal aid have been subject to means testing regarding their capital assets.The Legal Aid Agency’s exceptional case funding scheme was originally expected to help 7,000 people a year following the 2012 reforms. Instead it supports only a few hundred. Deborah Coles, the director of Inquest, which supports families at coroners courts, welcomed the report. She said it was unfair for bereaved families – who often struggled to access legal aid – not to be represented while state agencies involved in deaths were automatically represented at public expense. “Bereaved families have a vested interest in uncovering systemic failings, in the hope that future deaths can be prevented,” said Coles.The president of the Law Society of England and Wales, Christina Blacklaws, said: “Legal aid is truly a lifeline for the vulnerable. We welcome the fact the committee took our evidence on board regarding the impact that changes to legal aid in 2012 have had on the ability of iniduals to access justice, and the detrimental impact of the legal aid cuts on wider society.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5452c5a59418e1c5a1ae237fff4187cc876f7f8a/0_2053_4571_2743/master/4571.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fd3fbe7e113850a91b29c2da68aae288","title":"judy joo spicy korean ramyun noodles recipe","story":"Instant noodles make a great speedy supper – ditch the seasoning packet for your own flavoured stock to take them to new heightsSometimes nothing hits the spot better than instant ramyun (Korean for ramen) and a cold beer.

There are 4.2m leasehold properties in England, and around half are on leases of under 80 years, leaving residents vulnerable to what critics say are rapacious demands from freeholders for lease extensions. With ground rents averaging around £370 a year, that suggests a cost of £3,700 – far less than the £10,000 to £40,000 typically sought from a leaseholder for a flat valued at £200,000 with fewer than 80 years left on the lease.Its second option is to standardise the existing regime for leasehold valuations, removing a complicated element called “marriage value” that it said currently increases the cost paid by leaseholders. The Law Commission also proposed new formulas for leaseholders who extend their lease rather than buying the freehold. It suggested that they could have a right to extend the lease for up to 250 years, and no longer have to pay ground rents. The Law Commission said proposals were only at an outline stage, and that a full consultation document would not be published until the autumn, with new rules unlikely until summer 2019.Any changes to the calculation of leasehold extensions is likely to meet fierce resistance from freeholders, with the fortunes of Britain’s wealthiest aristocrats, such as the Duke of Westminster, rooted in lucrative leasehold property estates in central London.A legal challenge to existing leasehold valuations – which estimated that leaseholders were overpaying by hundreds of millions of pounds every year – was rejected by the Court of Appeal earlier this year. The Law Commission said it would have to ensure that “sufficient compensation” was paid to landlords. “Any changes to the law that government takes forward will have to comply with human rights legislation and take account of the impact of reform.“And while some changes – in particular the options that we have been asked to present to reduce the premium payable by leaseholders – will inevitably benefit leaseholders at the expense of landlords, that is not the case across the board.”Campaigners for leasehold reform, who demonstrated outside parliament on Wednesday, welcomed the proposals. Sebastian O’Kelly of the Leasehold Knowledge Partnership said: “Lease extension and enfranchisement – the buying of the freehold – are two highly lucrative rackets.“The mathematical formulae agreed by the courts were obligingly provided by estate agents for the richest freehold owners in the country. The only way to end this racket is a fixed formula of annual multiples of ground rent, as exists in Northern Ireland and Scotland, then your home is truly yours.”Around one in five new-build houses in recent years – and almost every flat – have been sold as leasehold, some with spiralling ground rents that have made selling them near impossible."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/539f6677caf6a60189c025b25247d747d608e492/0_130_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e347a42d46b7423598f40869db9d6a3e","title":"media experts alarmed at consequences of cliff richard ruling","story":"Privacy ruling could have substantial impact on future media coverage of criminal casesWhen he emerged from court on Wednesday after a judge ruled in his favour in one of the most carefully watched media law cases of the year, Sir Cliff Richard declared himself delighted at what he saw as a vital victory over the BBC.But while there is no doubt that the decision is a blow to the corporation, the case sets a wider precedent, too – and one that experts say could have a substantial impact on the future media coverage of criminal cases.Richard was awarded at least £210,000 in damages after the BBC reported that he was being investigated by police over claims of historic sexual abuse. No charges were ever brought, and in response Richard spent millions of pounds fighting the broadcaster, successfully arguing that the BBC’s right to report the facts of an ongoing investigation did not outweigh his right to privacy.But while the singer’s story drew inidual sympathy, there was some alarm among media experts at the wider consequences that the ruling could bring with it. Lawyer David Malone of Red Lion Chambers, who specialises in cases involving serious sexual offences, said media coverage of alleged abusers often encouraged other victims to come forward.“It is important that, in appropriate cases in the future, the police are not cowed by this judgment, and do still at the very least consider reporting the name of an inidual, when that action may enable other victims to come forward to strengthen the case against that inidual,” said Malone, who urged police forces to provide the media with the names of iniduals suspected of serious sexual offences.The judge in the case concluded that “a suspect has a reasonable expectation of privacy in relation to a police investigation”, raising concerns among many lawyers and news outlets that the British media tradition of being able to factually report the details of pre-charge investigations was under the threat.Malone said the case has “potentially huge, and perhaps constitutional, implications” for cases involving historic child abuse, especially by those in positions of power and influence. But he insisted the judgment still made it clear that there was a clear public interest to naming suspects since many witnesses often only come forward when another person has already “put their head above the parapet” – such as in the case of paedophile BBC presenter Stuat Hall – providing police and the media could justify their actions.However, other lawyers and editors suggested the ruling would effectively shut down press coverage of those under investigation in all but the most extreme of cases, for fear of being sued for breach of privacy.British contempt laws already ban media outlets from publishing material information that might seriously prejudice active legal proceedings, effectively meaning news coverage is muted from the moment that an inidual is charged. If pre-charge coverage is also restricted then reporting major cases could be effectively limited to official statements from the police and court proceedings, until the point at which a trial concluded and a verdict is delivered.Ian Murray of the Society of Editors insisted that “such a major change in the law should be debated in parliament and not come into force following one case involving a high-profile celebrity”, while Tony Gallagher, the editor of the Sun, warned that “suspects will assert privacy rights” in a bid to stop coverage.Iniduals involved in law enforcement said the case made it clear that reporting restrictions should be tighter. Dame Vera Baird QC, of the Association of Police and Crime Commissioners, said the case provided extra clarity that the police should not publicise the name those arrested or suspected of a crime, except in “exceptional circumstances where there is a legitimate policing purpose to do so”.The judge acknowledged concerns that his judgment “capable of having a significant impact on press reporting” but insisted he was not changing the law, merely applying the right to privacy which already existed. He said: “If the position of the press is now different from that which it has been in the past, that is because of the Human Rights Act, and not because of some court-created principle.”One man happy with the new precedent is Richard himself, who said he spent £4m on the case so others would not have their names made public before charges are brought and said he’d “rather 10 guilty people get away with it than one innocent person suffer”.“I just hope the press don’t think the freedom of speech is in danger here,” he said in an interview with ITV News. “It’s not. It’s their abuse of it that’s in danger. That’s what I’ll always fight.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0d8ff3d5f69f50e1896536c30e6d99750d14ff99/0_0_5993_4016/master/5993.jpg?w=300\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0ce15566d46aec58b8fff6dae678a565","title":"what is your earliest childhood memory and did it really happen","story":"A new study suggests that many first memories are actually fictional and based on photographs and family stories.

For some, it is their first bee sting or a formative interaction with a parent as a toddler. Others claim to be able to recall lying in a pram. But how sure are you that you have actually remembered this experience, rather than it being informed by photographs and family anecdotes?Professor Martin Conway, director of the Centre for Memory and Law at City, University of London, and co-author of the research, explained what fuels such fictional first memories: “When we looked through the responses from participants, we found that a lot of these first ‘memories’ were frequently related to infancy, and a typical example would be a memory based around a pram. For this person, this type of memory could have resulted from someone saying something like ‘mother had a large green pram’. The person then imagines what it would have looked like. Over time these fragments then become a memory and often the person will start to add things in such as a string of toys along the top.” We are interested to hear what you believe to be your earliest memory.

He just hit it so clean, so crisp.”The noise of that nine iron is Oberholser’s abiding memory of playing with Rory McIlroy at the 2007 Open at Carnoustie. McIlroy was 18 then and still an amateur. Oberholser and a lot of the other US players had never even heard of him. That changed pretty quick. McIlroy shot a 68 on the first day, one better than Tiger Woods, and won the Silver Medal for the leading amateur at the end of the week.Oberholser recalls the 8th where McIlroy’s ball was stuck on a steep down slope just off the green. “He grabbed a lofted club, which shocked me,” Oberholser says, “slipped under it and lofted it on to the green and rolled it up there to about a foot. I went, ‘Whoa! That’s not an amateur shot: that’s a best‑player-in-the-world shot.”There are a lot of these old stories going around this week about the way McIlroy played on his Open debut here that year. Trevor Immelman remembers his practice round with McIlroy. “I had no clue who he was. He was a little bit chubby and he had a lot of hair sticking out under his cap. I was like ‘Who is this guy?’ After 11 holes my coach, David Leadbetter, joins our group and he says: ‘Is this kid any good?’ I said: ‘Led, he’s making me feel inferior in every possible way.’”McIlroy has told a few himself. He remembers playing with Padraig Harrington’s son Paddy behind the 18th green while Harrington was in that four-hole play-off with Sergio García. The boy is 15 now. “It’s so funny thinking back on that day,” McIlroy says. “I think I saw Paddy today walking with Padraig, he’s massive now.” McIlroy does not have any kids himself “but hopefully, there’s a young amateur this week waiting behind the 18th green on me, and I’m the one that’s coming up there and trying to win the tournament”.It has been four years since McIlroy won his last major, the PGA at Valhalla in 2014. Time is starting to drag. It seems every major McIlroy plays these days begins with a lot of questions about why his barren streak has gone on so long and when it is going to end. He does not have any good answers. “I’m trying,” he says. “I’m trying my best every time I tee it up and it just hasn’t happened.” The game can get awfully complicated if you let it. McIlroy has\u0026nbspchanged his putter six times in the past year and has just switched it again. No wonder he is starting to pine for the time when everything seemed so simple.“I love the way he makes everything look so easy,” Nick Faldo said when he watched McIlroy play in 2007. “He tees it up, sees the shot and just goes.”This was the McIlroy who said, when he was asked how he managed to shape the ball so well: “I just think draw and I hit draw, I see it in my head and then I just hit the shot.” The man caddying for him that week, Gordon Faulkner, said at the time McIlroy was so clear in his thinking that he was “about 15 years ahead of where he should be when it comes to the mental side of golf”.The best part of 15 years later the 29-year-old McIlroy says he is trying to get back into that teenage mind-set: “It was my first Open Championship. I mean I was just trying to soak everything in and I was just so grateful to be here. I think sometimes I need to get back to that attitude where I play carefree and am just happy to be here.”McIlroy has been enjoying practising with Jon Rahm “because the first instinct he has is get up on a tee box and pull a driver out of the bag. Not think about the trouble or think about anything. Just, ‘This is where I want to hit it, and this is where I want to go’.” That is exactly how McIlroy wants to play this week. He has been saying he is planning to use his driver here, even though the ground is so hard that his ball will surely fetch up in trouble often as not. He says he is confident the rough is so thin that there is “five to 10 yards either side of the fairway” where he can get away with it.It sounds reckless. But McIlroy feels that, as he has got older, he has got more cautious. Which is one way of looking at it others may call it wisdom. But he is convinced it is holding him back. “There is something nice about being young and being oblivious to some stuff,” McIlroy says. “I remember back to when we last played The Open here and, again, I was just happy to be here. I was bouncing down the fairways, didn’t care if I shot 82 or 62. The more I can get into that mind-set, the better I’ll play golf.”The danger is he is chasing something none of us ever gets back: our youth."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3b80dfcaae6111150548ae898b19825b21b7b18c/0_76_8026_4815/master/8026.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4e57734157bce6dc7534f3516a0268c0","title":"chef zoe adjonyoh on the smells that unlock family memories","story":"From the childhood smells of frying black pudding and burning peat in Ireland, to the traditional ingredients discovered in Ghana and Dalston, chef Zoe Adjonyoh has always followed her noseListening to Zoe Adjonyoh talk about her dual-heritage upbringing is like reading a foodie travelogue that immediately has you salivating. The daughter of an Irish mother and Ghanian father, she spent the first couple of years of her life with her extended family in Ghana before growing up in south-east London and holidaying in Ireland to visit her maternal grandmother. Food – heaps of food from cooks who wouldn’t tolerate anyone leaving the dinner table hungry – features strongly in childhood memories of long summer days in Bantry Bay, County Cork. “Some of my earliest memories are very specifically about the smell of food cooking in Ireland – cabbage, black pudding frying. My aunt had a butcher’s shop so I was used to seeing a pig’s head on the counter and cows’ tongues hanging on hooks. We ate lots of offal, but we also used to go to the beach to hunt for crabs, to the river for salmon, and to the mountain to dig out peat for the fire – that smell always unlocks memories of my mum and her family. Peat, the smell of the sea, the morning dew – that landscape had its own special smell, a smell of freshness.”Food from a very different landscape was how, as a keen home cook, Adjonyoh later discovered and explored her Ghanian identity. The mysterious ingredients her father brought home to cook with were the same ones she would use to create dishes for her pop-up supper club in Brixton and her debut cookbook, Zoe’s Ghana Kitchen, published to great acclaim last year. These staples of Ghanian cookery were, she says, her sensory “access points” to finding out about her African heritage.“My father would be cooking with things I’d never heard of I didn’t know what they were,” she recalls. “Before I could taste them, I’d be aware of their unfamiliar smell and that’s a really strong memory of him in the kitchen – I’d want to eat something just from the aroma while it cooked.” After travelling to Ghana as an adult, and experimenting with traditional dishes back at home in her Hackney Wick kitchen, she started cooking updated versions of the recipes for friends. She sourced produce from Dalston’s Ridley Road market, getting to know the Ghanian women who sold from kiosks. “Shopping there, for me, was like being transported to another world,” she recalls. “They would help me identify ingredients and tell me how to cook them. The smells, flavours and colours were just amazing.”Some of the smells when she visited Ghana were a little too amazing. At a market with her aunt, Adjonyoh asked what a particularly pungent smell was. “What smell?” said her aunt, and carried on shopping. It turned out to be some cowhide drying in the sun, ready for eating later. Laughing, she recalls her aunt’s brief explanation: “‘Oh that’s wele,’ and I said: ‘What the hell is wele?’” The flavour wasn’t as strong as the smell, once she plucked up the courage to try it. “I was a bit wary of it, to be honest.”While her father’s cooking was hearty and traditional, it was a case of “there you are, get stuck in, don’t bother with cutlery”, she explains.Adjonyoh adapted recipes to make them visually appealing (gloopy okra was transformed into okra fries) because of the adage about people eating with their eyes. But it was the smell of her peanut butter stew – based on her father’s legendary groundnut soup – that drew people to come and buy food from an impromptu stall at her flat. “The dish has an amazing smell profile from the blend of spices,” she says. “People were asking what the smell was, how the dish was made. It was very much the smell that brought people to my door.”A career in food wasn’t the plan, but the clamour for her African cooking paid her way through an MA in creative writing: “It was just the demand. I loved the cooking and so did all the people who tried it.” The supper club, with just six tables and housed in a shipping container, was born, and for three years celebrated the variety, richness and abundance of Ghanian food. Now it’s time for a new adventure, with Adjonyoh travelling across Kenya and Uganda for a month to meet female chefs, cooks and food bloggers: “I want to understand each country’s relationship with food, the history of that, their distinctive produce and why it is that their food industry is largely dominated by women.” The journey will once again unite her passions for cooking, writing and travel. “I can’t wait to soak up the sights and sounds of two new food cultures,” she says. “When you’re travelling, all your senses are heightened. The first thing that always draws me in is food smells. No doubt I’ll be led by my nose again.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f7dae1e371036c56e07a389fbd051b98c88bead3/105_986_4289_2574/master/4289.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f904be79f7dcf0cf762ba89996b9dd23","title":"allelujah review alan bennett bridge theatre","story":"The Bridge theatre, LondonPatients’ singalongs and Bennett’s stinging wit light up a state-of-the-nation play set on a geriatric ward Hospitals make good theatre. Shortly after Alan Bennett made his playwriting debut in 1968 with Forty Years On, Peter Nichols wrote The National Health in which a crumbling Victorian gothic ward became a metaphor for contemporary Britain. Now Bennett echoes Nichols’ device, in a play full of quiet anger under its surface charm, by using a hospital as a way of dissecting the problems with the body politic. Bennett’s setting is the geriatric ward of a Yorkshire hospital, the Bethlehem, threatened with closure. It is not, however, going down without a fight. Salter, the self-important chair of its trust, has waged a sponsored campaign to keep it alive and has a TV crew on hand to record its vitality. The patients are a cheery lot with their own choir. Even Sister Gilchrist has her own peculiar methods to ensure maximum cleanliness. But the arrival of Colin, a management consultant attached to the health ministry, suggests that the days of this kind of cradle-to-grave hospital are numbered. As so often in Bennett, plot is secondary to pungent points. One happily accepts the coincidence that Colin’s dad, a former miner, is one of the patients because of Bennett’s ability to register his rage at what our society has become. The pivotal scene is a confrontation between Salter and Colin in which the former makes the case for a hospital that serves its community, is efficiently run and even makes a profit. To Colin, the hospital’s success in meeting its targets is proof of its dispensability. “The state,” he argues, “should not be seen to work. If the state is seen to work, we shall never be rid of it.” In this richly discursive play, Bennett hits his own chosen targets. An immigrant doctor, depending on a student visa, is threatened with deportation and rebuked for his hands-on care. The hospital’s attempt to survive is tied up with publicity gimmicks and the renaming of wards after pop stars. There is even a brutal logic to Sister Gilchrist’s determination to ensure the ward has a rapid turnover. But, this being a Bennett play, there is a wealth of good jokes and a deceptive patina of nostalgia. The classic songs, arranged by George Fenton and sung by the patients, are proof of the durability of age and a poignant reminder of a lost happiness. Bennett is not above using familiar tropes: the former schoolmaster sadly awaiting a visit from a former student is straight out of Terence Rattigan’s Separate Tables. But this is a sharp, funny, subversively political play whose episodic structure is cleverly camouflaged by Nicholas Hytner as director, Bob Crowley as designer and Arlene Phillips as choreographer.In a 25-strong cast there are some fine performances. Deborah Findlay as the criminally efficient Sister, Peter Forbes as the self-aggrandising Salter, Samuel Barnett as the post-Thatcherite Colin and Sacha Dhawan as the precarious immigrant all impress. Among the patients Julia Foster as an ex-librarian, Jeff Rawle as the old miner and Simon Williams as the scholarly teacher stand out. It is also touching to note the presence of Cleo Sylvestre, who played a young nurse in The National Health, to which Bennett’s play provides an invaluable companion-piece in its ability to find in a hospital a microcosm of modern society."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4b8523949ad20fae868cfdd1cdf98887f270aed7/0_172_5200_3120/master/5200.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e5c474c888e79a05c252b50f449e821b","title":"make your own history with a tour of irelands ancient east","story":"For a road trip less ordinary, sail across the Irish Sea to experience the finest medieval castles, prehistoric stone circles and culinary hotspots the Emerald Isle has to offer. By Anna HartMain image: Durrow Viaduct, part of Waterford Greenway (Getty)Few European destinations are as culturally and historically rich as Ireland’s Ancient East, making it perfect road-trip material for travellers who crave experiences beyond the ordinary. Thanks to ferry connections at Dublin and Rosslare, it’s easy to bring your own car over from Great Britain, opening up a wealth of glorious drives through undulating hills and ancient forests. Add in stop-offs at prehistoric burial sites, spellbinding castles and characterful country pubs and it’s easy to understand why Ireland’s Ancient East is climbing to the top of the must-do lists of intrepid travellers. Here’s what not to miss …Binge on natural scenery Get a brand new profile pic at Powerscourt waterfall at the foot of the Wicklow mountains, Ireland’s highest cascade at 121 metres. It’s a scenic three-mile drive through the ancient forests of the Powerscourt estate – and look out for the giant sequoia. In Wicklow, charter boats leave regularly on dolphin-watching trips, which also showcase scenic and historic spots from a sea-based vantage point. If you’re feeling active, hire bikes and cycle the Waterford Greenway, a 28-mile bike route that traces a former rail track between Waterford and Dungarvan.Culture and creativity  For such a small nation, Ireland has a rich heritage of craft and design. The National Craft Gallery in Kilkenny’s Medieval Mile (which forms part of the Kilkenny Craft Trail) serves as a useful introduction to the Irish traditions of jewellery making, pottery, weaving and other cottage industries. The stable block at Kilkenny Castle is a working gallery and studio space, where you might catch young potters at the wheel, or meet other makers and producers.Exploring Ireland’s Ancient East by car immediately immerses you in some 5,000 years of history. Start with the Boyne valley, where you’ll find ancient burial mounds at Newgrange, Dowth and Knowth (which comprise the Brú na Bóinne Unesco world heritage site). Slane Castle and Slane Castle Distillery are worth a tour, but don’t miss Trim Castle, Ireland’s largest Anglo-Norman castle. Ireland is a country where myths and legends merge into history, and you’ll definitely want to make a pilgrimage to medieval Blarney Castle to kiss the Blarney Stone, which bestows “the gift of the gab” on all who climb the steps to press their lips upon it.Bed down in a country house hotel One of the chief pleasures of an Irish road trip is the array of elegant country house hotels to choose from, often at refreshingly affordable prices. The elegant Athenaeum House hotel in Waterford is a superb choice, a canary-yellow Georgian manor on the banks of the River Suir. In Clonmel in County Tipperary, stylish digs are found at Hotel Minella, another Georgian architectural triumph, dating back to 1863. And less than an hour from Dublin, just outside Naas, sits the stately Victorian Killashee hotel and spa, with views over the Wicklow mountains and the Kildare countryside. Irish Ferries offers three nights at the Hotel Minella with return cruise ferry for two adults and their own car, from £180 each £228 each for the Athenaeum House hotel or £226 for the Killashee hotel and spa.

Zuckerberg’s comments came the same day that Facebook announced a new policy pledging to remove misinformation used to incite physical harm.The CEO’s remarks to Recode have reignited debates about free speech on the social network at a time when Facebook is continuing to face scrutiny over its role in spreading misinformation, propaganda and hate speech across the globe. Last year, the  reported on internal Facebook moderation documents which suggested that the company flouted Holocaust denial laws except in countries where it was likely to be sued or prosecuted. Zuckerberg, who has also come under fire for Facebook’s role in election interference efforts and the company’s misuse of personal data, reiterated his commitment to allowing abhorrent content on the platform in the latest interview. He said Holocaust deniers were “deeply offensive”, but “I don’t believe that our platform should take that down because I think there are things that different people get wrong. I don’t think that they’re intentionally getting it wrong … It’s hard to impugn intent and to understand the intent. I just think, as abhorrent as some of those examples are, I think the reality is also that I get things wrong when I speak publicly.”Zuckerberg said offensive speech can cross a line and face removal when it is harassing or endangering people: “We are moving towards the policy of misinformation that is aimed at or going to induce violence, we are going to take down … If it’s going to result in real harm, real physical harm, or if you’re attacking iniduals, then that content shouldn’t be on the platform.” Platforms like Facebook and YouTube have faced intense scrutiny for allowing the far-right commentator Alex Jones to continue to host his Infowars site, which most infamously has spread the false claim that the Sandy Hook mass shooting that killed 20 schoolchildren was a hoax. That content, Zuckerberg said, would be removed if it was abusive towards an inidual: “Going to someone who is a victim of Sandy Hook and telling them, ‘Hey, no, you’re a liar’ – that is harassment, and we actually will take that down.”Zuckerberg also faced repeated questions about his feelings on Facebook’s influence in Myanmar, where hate speech has exploded on the platform, with some linking killings to content on the site. He did not answer directly, but said: “People use tools for good and bad, but I think that we have a clear responsibility to make sure that the good is amplified and to do everything we can to mitigate the bad.”If something false were to spread, fact checkers would rate it false and the post “would lose the vast majority of its distribution” on the newsfeed, the statement added. On Wednesday, Facebook told reporters at its Menlo Park headquarters that it would be taking down misinformation used to provoke physical harm, rather than just de-ranking it in the news feed.The announcement was spurred by outbreaks of anti-Muslim violence in Sri Lanka. One of the triggers for the violence was posts spreading misinformation about the Muslim community. The situation escalated to the point that the Sri Lankan government temporarily blocked Facebook’s services in March after misinformation inciting violence remained online for days after it was reported.The company said it was working with civil society groups to better understand how misinformation spurs local tensions but that it had yet to draw up clear criteria for what constitutes violence, and which other countries apart from Sri Lanka would be the initial focus of the policy. “At the moment we are starting the work in countries where we’ve recently seen instances where misinformation has been perceived to contribute to physical violence offline,” explained Facebook’s Tessa Lyons.Facebook said that last month it had removed content falsely alleging that Muslims were poisoning food intended for Buddhists after local partners indicated it could incite violence. The policy would eventually be implemented globally, the company said. In his interview, Zuckerberg was also asked about the Cambridge Analytica data scandal, which the  first reported in 2015. In March, the Observer and the  revealed that millions of Americans’ personal data was harvested from the site through an app and improperly shared with Cambridge Analytica, a political consultancy. In the interview, the CEO noted that the  “initially” alerted Facebook to the work of Aleksandr Kogan, the academic researcher who harvested the data, saying: “And when we learned about that, we immediately shut down the app, took away his profile, and demanded certification that the data was deleted.”Facebook, however, did not suspend Kogan and the associated company until March of 2018, despite the ’s reporting several years prior. A spokesperson later said that Zuckerberg had misspoken when he claimed the company “immediately ... took away his profile”, admitting that this removal had not happened until this year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/28a5d7a2706b7dedf871cfc4c667b3e42c11ec94/0_0_2040_1224/master/2040.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=812776753a6b4bea412a60ca508f0fe3","title":"adobe and the search for the lost fonts of the bauhaus","story":"The quest to track down long-forgotten typographical gems from the troves of the renowned German design institutionIn the esoteric world of typography, legendary designer Erik Spiekermann is the equivalent of Indiana Jones. He doesn’t wear a battered fedora or carry a whip. He has never raced through the desert on camels in a quest for the holy grail, or fought his way out of buried Egyptian tombs on the trail of the lost ark. But to graphic designers, animators, typographers and font aficionados he has done something far more impressive: he brought hidden fonts back to life and, with the help of an international group of design students, has, in his own words, “liberated them from the drawing board”.These are no ordinary fonts, either, but fonts created by students of the Bauhaus. Founded in 1919 and shut down by the Nazis for its political and aesthetic radicalism in 1933, the Bauhaus had an inestimable impact on the art and architecture of the 20th century, and its approach to typography continues to inspire designers to this day.“Bauhaus is the most famous design school and every design student knows about it,” says Rufus Deuchler, principal manager of Creative Cloud evangelism at software company Adobe. “Adobe’s Hidden Treasures concept is all about bringing back to life pieces of art from the past, and we came up with the idea of tracking down the lost fonts of Bauhaus.”Adobe has form when it comes to bringing art treasures back to life it enabled designers and artists to paint with digitally recreated versions of the brushes of celebrated artist Edvard Munch when it launched its Hidden Treasures concept last year.As part of the project, digital artists around the world submitted their version of The Scream, Munch’s most famous work the winner got to see their work hanging next to the original painting in the Munch Museum in Oslo.Reviving the fonts of the Bauhaus was a very different task. First of all, Spiekermann had to track down the original fonts themselves, which meant trawling through the archives at the Bauhaus school in Dessau – one of the three original Bauhaus school buildings – which stored everything when the school was abruptly shut down.With help from Adobe and Bauhaus, Spiekermann discovered hundreds of artworks, posters, sketches and student exercises that had been kept flat in drawers and art portfolios for nearly 100 years. Some were just fragments, while others were more complete works, but working with a group of international design students, the typographer was able to select five different font designs and set about bringing them back to life. Just being in the presence of original Bauhaus work was incredibly moving, says Spiekermann. “The minute the work is unwrapped, you’re back to 90 years ago and in the presence of the students themselves,” he says. “The rooms were stark – black and white with a little bit of colour every now and then – but they were also airy, with lots of light, so they were geometric in a very liberating, pleasant way, and there was a kind of joyful starkness about the building.“You can imagine these guys in their 20s sweating over their creations, sketching away while a strict professor told them to draw straight lines and not to smudge their work,” he says. “It was a physical and emotional joy for us, as we could not only look at their work but smell and touch it too. It’s like seeing the Mona Lisa for the first time: you have seen it in books and countless reproductions, but all of a sudden you think: ‘Oh my god, this is different.’ It was magic.”Rather than the perfect digital images we are used to, Spiekermann loved seeing the imperfections of the work. “They used glue and pencil and all the things we don’t use any more,” he says. “Everything nowadays is virtual, which can also mean that it doesn’t exist. But this is atoms, not pixels, and close up you can see the imperfections in the work because it’s all hand-drawn.”The original Bauhaus typefaces were created mainly for a specific poster or an exercise in class, meaning that the students didn’t design the whole font. However, out of the fragments of the artworks, Spiekermann and his students created whole alphabets.“They really surprised us with their passion for these fonts,” says Deuchler. “Creating a font is an incredibly complex process, which takes not only hard work and discipline but knowledge. It’s not just a matter of drawing a letter – A, B, C and so on. It’s about the understanding of how an alphabet works.”With the first two lost Bauhaus fonts already being available for download through Adobe – three more will follow in the coming months – the next generation of artists have wasted no time in getting to grips with the new type. “We are already seeing a whole lot of engagement from designers all over the world using those fonts, which is really exciting to see,” says Deuchler. Launched at the recent three-day Adobe Live event, the fonts have received a “very positive reaction” from designers, says Deuchler.“What I find really interesting is that for the younger generation, who don’t necessarily know about the Bauhaus, there’s this whole opportunity to learn history. It’s like opening a history book and seeing how modern and relevant these things are – it’s a teachable moment.” To mark the launch of The Lost Alphabets of Bauhaus, Adobe has launched a series of five challenges encouraging creatives to use these fonts for the very first time and win prizes, including an all-expenses-paid trip to Dessau, Germany to visit the Bauhaus archives.

How can we ensure new tools such as big data and artificial intelligence are a force for good?Wherever humans go, we leave little trails of data behind us. There are the digital bits – Facebook profiles, mailing lists, search histories – and there is the treasure trove our bodies can produce. Smart watches can pick up changes in skin conductivity that indicate how stressed you are, and sleep trackers can monitor how much you’re moving at night, to determine whether you’ve had the recommended eight hours’ kip. And, increasingly, we’re seeing wearables move out of the home and into the workplace.In 2015, BP in North America distributed 24,500 fitness trackers to employees and their partners, and offered staff money off their health insurance if they met their exercise goals. Other companies, including the Bank of America, Kimberly-Clark, Time Warner and Target are also offering their employees similar trackers.But workplace wearables are about much more than fitness alone. At a factory in Hangzhou, China, employees have been given helmets with embedded sensors that allegedly monitor brainwaves and can detect when employees are feeling angry or depressed. In Amsterdam, financial traders experimented with a bracelet that measures emotions through electrodermal activity, using light patterns and colours to indicate when they are in a heightened emotional state. The idea is that if people are more aware of their feelings, they are more likely to rethink their decisions and less likely to act recklessly.But how do we, as humans, feel about all this data gathering? “For a long time, people looked at wearables as if they might be a big brother-type scenario, to do with surveillance within the organisation,” says Chris Brauer, director of innovation at the Institute of Management Studies at Goldsmiths, University of London. “But now they’re viewed more as an opportunity to gather evidence to substantiate things that are going on in the workplace.”There’s also the argument that cold data can provide an unbiased picture of how people are feeling and why they might be acting in a certain way. “If an employee is really stressed, they’re unlikely to report that to their employers for fear that it’ll be seen as a projection of weakness,” says Brauer. “What wearables do is provide evidence-based data that’s accurate and therefore indicative of what’s going on.”However, there are fears that companies might use wearables to keep tabs on employees. In January, Amazon was granted a patent on a wristband that could pinpoint the location of warehouse employees and buzz if they were about to place an item in the wrong section. The online retailer has also used tracking technology to make sure its warehouse employees don’t fall below a certain level of productivity.It’s not just warehouse employees who are subjected to digital surveillance – there is a whole industry that produces software to keep an eye on office workers. There are programmes that track keystrokes and cross-reference those against screenshots automatically grabbed from employees’ screens to make sure they’re working. In January 2016, the Daily  removed sensors it had installed that used heat and motion detection to monitor whether people were at their desks.In other professions, however, keeping track of employees can be a matter of life or death. Australian company Seeing Machines develops computer vision systems that can recognise when a driver is distracted or about to fall asleep at the wheel. Currently, the eye-tracking system is used to detect the fatigue levels of truck drivers, pilots, train drivers and people who operate heavy machinery.Even though wellness regimes might add to company productivity in the long run, Murden says it’s important that companies don’t run staff ragged. “We’re not just computers, you can’t just switch us on and expect us to keep going and going,” she says. “But when you support a team properly and they’re working to their absolute optimum, that’s when they’ll flourish.”For Murden, bringing a workforce up to its full potential can involve a broad range of approaches. Sometimes Push Mind and Body prescribes Beyoncé dance classes, or sets up workshops that help people learn how to use stress to their advantage. Murden also teaches employees how to prep their meals for the working week, or recommends one-on-one psychotherapy sessions.Part of the problem with the modern workplace is that it can be difficult for people to manage their workloads, says Chintan Patel, chief technologist at Cisco UK and Ireland. For all the benefits they bring, the ubiquity of smartphones and laptops means that the line between work and home is more blurred than ever before. “If I can access something from my mobile device, does that mean I’m contactable 24 hours a day and need to be responding all the time?” he asks.But instead of turning us into drones, there is the possibility that technology could eventually help to make us feel a little more human at work. Brauer says that it might not be such a bad thing if the most repetitive parts of our jobs do become automated, because this would free up our time and energy to do things that humans are really good at.Some artificial intelligence (AI) systems can already detect from a photograph whether a mole or freckle is cancerous faster than dermatologists. This could be good news for doctors and patients, Brauer says. “They can reinvest that time in professional development, research, or spending more time with their families or patients.”“The technology that’s coming is offering us rehumanising potential,” Brauer says, as long as companies use it as an opportunity to retrain their employees and increase their skills, rather than letting it displace human workers altogether. Patel agrees. With Cisco he’s already thinking about how he can use AI to replace the most repetitive parts of his employees’ days and give them more time to get on with work that excites them, or to concentrate on self-development.We’re already seeing AI tools start to trickle into the mainstream. Smart compose features, which cut down on the need for repetitive typing within emails, are becoming a reality. Virtual personal assistants are becoming more useful – and less of a novelty – with every update. Recently, Google even showcased its assistant booking a hair appointment over the phone.The internet giant reckons voice assistants will soon go the way of wearables and make the shift from being a device we’re used to using in our homes, to one that is commonplace in the office too.As long as this technology is used to empower rather than oppress workers, Brauer is optimistic about the future of the workplace. In the not-too-distant future, many of us will be part of augmented workforces in which people work alongside machines and AI systems that help achieve more with our time, while allowing us to break free from the most mind-numbing parts of our jobs. Technology, it seems, might be just what we need to stop us turning into robots after all.Click here to discover how Cisco can help your SME growIllustration by Bewilder.tv for the "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6d89968f3f82d0f79ce07294fd77e71a7ed93a2f/0_0_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1bc588a34a06000ac3c669214b6335c8","title":"turkeys state of emergency ends but crackdown continues","story":"Laws enacted after 2016 coup attempt are lifted but ‘climate of fear’ remains, say criticsTurkey’s two-year state of emergency came to an end at midnight on Wednesday, but as trials of dissidents and journalists continue human rights campaigners have said Ankara must do more to reverse a “suffocating” crackdown on free speech.Critics say the state of emergency, in place since a failed coup attempt in July 2016 that killed 250 people and wounded 1,400, has been used to detain opponents of the president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, and his government for lengthy periods without trial and to intimidate dissidents and prosecute media outlets. More than 120,000 people in the police, military, academia, media and civil service have been detained or dismissed from their jobs over their alleged links to Fethullah Gülen, an exiled preacher based in the US whose supporters Ankara blames for the coup. “Over the last two years, Turkey has been radically transformed with emergency measures used to consolidate draconian powers, silence critical voices and strip away basic rights,” said Fotis Filippou, Amnesty International’s deputy director for Europe. “The lifting of the state of emergency alone will not reverse this crackdown. What is needed is systematic action to restore respect for human rights, allow civil society to flourish again and lift the suffocating climate of fear that has engulfed the country.”Turkey’s government has said it will not seek a renewal of the state of emergency, allowing it to lapse two years after it was imposed and days after Erdoğan was sworn in as president for a fresh five-year term with extraordinary new powers narrowly approved in a referendum last year.Critics say the use of the emergency powers went beyond Gülenists linked to the coup. About a quarter of Turkey’s judges have either been dismissed or detained, a vast realignment of the judiciary that has prompted outrage and concerns that it is no longer independent.Thousands have been tried, with many sentenced to life, for involvement in the coup and 100 people have been extradited to Turkey at the behest of the country’s intelligence service, the MİT. The crackdown has also increased tensions with western allies such as the EU and the US. On Wednesday a court in the city of İzmir ruled for the continued detention of Andrew Brunson, an American pastor accused of having Gülenist links, in a move that could prompt congressional sanction and that was described by an official at the US Commission on International Religious Freedom as a “mockery of justice”.Erdoğan’s ruling Justice and Development (AK) party has tabled a controversial anti-terrorism bill that will retain some of the state of emergency measures. One provision allows local governors to impose curfews or make some areas off-limits to the public, making it easier to ban demonstrations.The government also appears determined to continue its prosecutions of journalists and opponents.Turkey is the world’s biggest jailer of journalists, ahead of China and Egypt, with more than 120 imprisoned since the coup attempt. Cumhuriyet journalists have been prosecuted in numerous court cases, with some, including the current editor-in-chief, appealing against convictions of up to seven-and-a-half years in jail. Erdoğan’s son-in-law and finance minister, Berat Albayrak, is also suing the journalists because of their reporting on offshore investments listed in the Paradise Papers, a move that the advocacy group Reporters Without Borders condemned as threatening the survival of independent media outlets reporting on corruption.“Independent media outlets are fewer now than the fingers on one hand,” said Ünker. “Journalism is our job so we have to do it in all conditions, even in the face of such duress and injustice.” But the crackdown appeared to have barely slowed even as the end of the state of emergency approached. A day before Erdoğan was sworn in, another 18,600 public servants were dismissed over alleged links to terror groups, and on Tuesday academics who had signed a petition calling for a peaceful resolution of the conflict with Kurdish separatists were sentenced to prison. Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu, the leader of the largest opposition bloc, the Republican People’s party (CHP), vowed in a party congress to challenge what he described as a “dictatorship” and one-man rule. But on Wednesday the government said it was launching an investigation against Kılıçdaroğlu for insulting the president, an allegation frequently used to intimidate critics, over a cartoon mocking the Turkish president that was shared on social media.The continued prosecutions offer a hint that, even though Erdoğan is secure in his control of the state’s levers of power and authority, there will be little immediate relief for dissidents.“I think state of emergency has served its purpose, both politically and practically,” said Selim Can Sazak, a Turkey expert and adjunct fellow at the Century Foundation. “The job is almost complete. Hundreds of thousands purged. Some Gülenists, apparently, but many others not.

Helen Delaney, a senior lecturer at the University of Auckland Business School, said employees’ motivation and commitment to work increased because they were included in the planning of the experiment, and played a key role in designing how the four-day week would be managed so as not to negatively impact productivity.“Employees designed a number of innovations and initiatives to work in a more productive and efficient manner, from automating manual processes to reducing or eliminating non-work-related internet usage,” said Delaney.Andrew Barnes said he would take the results of the trial to the board to open up a discussion on how a four-day work week could be implemented long-term in his company. “If you can have parents spending more time with their children, how is that a bad thing?” asked Barnes, who believes the new work model has the potential to profoundly impact society for the better.“Are you likely to get fewer mental health issues when you have more time to take care of yourself and your personal interests? Probably ... if you have fewer people in the office at any one time, can we make smaller offices?”New Zealand’s workplace relations minister, Iain Lees-Galloway, said the results of the trial were “very interesting” and he was keen to encourage businesses to trial new and improved work models. “I’m really keen to work with any businesses that are looking at how they can be more flexible for their staff and how they can look to improve productivity whilst working alongside their staff and protecting terms and conditions,” Less-Galloway said."},{"url":null,"title":"parents pay 1 200 a year to put children though secondary school","story":"Parents sending children to non fee-paying secondary schools will spend more than €1,200 this year, while primary school-going children will cost their parents almost €600, a survey published on Thursday suggests.The financial pressure of back-to-school time will see more than a third of parents with children in secondary school get into debt, with the cost of grinds said to be the largest financial burden, according to the research from Zurich Life Assurance.The cost of primary school education is 42 per cent higher than parents expect while the cost of secondary school education comes in 21 per cent above parents’ expectations,The cost per child of nearly all primary school expense categories has increased, with parents now paying €88 for books, €71 for uniforms, €64 for footwear and €52 for supplies annually.The highest spend during the primary school year was extra-curricular activities, which cost on average €191 per child per year. The highest spend items during the secondary school year were grinds at €279 and lunch at €177.In total, parents estimate that it costs €584 per year to send a child to primary school, and €1,236 per year for secondary school.The financial pressure to cover the costs of their children’s education has resulted in 19 per cent of primary school parents and 34 per cent of secondary school parents falling into debt. The average debt for parents borrowing to cover secondary school costs was put at €794 and €385 for parents of primary school children.The number of parents who have taken out loans to cover the cost of primary school education is put at 17 per cent compared with 9 per cent last year. And the number of parents taking out loans to cover the cost of secondary school has also gone up – almost one in three families now rely on loans to help finance their children’s education.“The findings of this year’s research show that the cost of primary and secondary education is significantly higher than parents expect and, more than ever, families are taking on debt to finance their children’s schooling,” said Zurich Life’s Jonathan Daly. “It is unsustainable for families to rely on borrowing to fund their children’s future and the most effective solution against this is rigorous early financial planning.”"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Cabinet is warned that pontiff\u0026rsquos forthcoming trip to Ireland carries a number of risksPlugging into the power of \u0026lsquocitizen energy\u0026rsquo thanks to cheap renewable technologiesGarda-Revenue swoop nets 30kg of MDMA, 20kg of ketamine, cannabis worth \u0026euro20,0000Gerry Reynolds, Noel Merrick regarded as likely choices for Sligo-Leitrim constituencyDepartment warned against changes to house built above 5,000-year-old tombSome services look good but those planned for working-class areas will be worse, says Brid SmithBrussels has vowed to stand by Ireland in no-deal \u0026lsquodoomsday scenario\u0026rsquo, says TaoiseachSinn F\u0026eacutein, SDLP, Alliance Party and Greens release joint statement outlining concernsCost of return to school will result in third of parents getting into debt, survey suggestsJudge bans man who threatened to kill wife from family home in separate caseEPA report shows sector has overtaken waste industry for non-complianceVaradkar raises prospect of penalties after revelations about Facebook\u0026rsquos moderation practicesMoving Ireland\u0026rsquos two million homes away from oil to renewable forms of energy is an immense taskFalling costs and technological advances mean that offshore wind farms are once again a viable, and economic, optionWith an economy based largely on agriculture, Ireland is uniquely placed to to generate biomethane using farm wasteThe Tipperary Energy Agency\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquodeep retrofit\u0026rsquo brings home-owners\u0026rsquo energy bills down from \u0026euro2,000 to \u0026euro200People can be nudged into doing their bit to save the planet, the SEAI believesEirGrid is at the heart of an all-Ireland energy system, but it cannot rest on its laurels, its chief executive Mark Foley saysRenewables are charging ahead despite figures \u0026ndash and that\u0026rsquos the view of the oil industryThe nerve centre of the Irish energy system tracks every flicker in demand"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3569318.1531933232!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"dowth hall redevelopment was opposed by government","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMinister for Heritage Josepha Madigan with Dr Clíodhna Ní Lionáin, Devenish’s lead archaeologist, at the passage tomb site at Dowth Hall, Co Meath on Monday July 16th. Photograph: Cyril ByrneThe The Department of Heritage originally opposed plans for the redevelopment of the protected 18th-century house at Dowth Hall in Co Meath, which was built above a 5,500-year-old Neolithic burial mound described this week as “the most significant megalithic find in Ireland in the last 50 years”.The department wrote to Meath County Council in November 2016, shortly after the house’s owners applied for planning permission to significantly extend and renovate the house, to say it had concerns about the negative impact of the plans on the site’s “architectural heritage significance”. Planning files show the department recommended that the council refuse to grant permission for the work on the house, built in the 1760s for the Netterville family, for heritage-related reasons.The department’s intervention came before the discovery of the large passage tomb on the land, just beneath the house. The tomb is believed to be half the size of nearby Newgrange, the best known of the monuments on the Brú na Bóinne Unesco world heritage site. While welcoming in principle the proposal to conserve and restore the house, the department noted in its 2016 letter that Dowth Hall was on the council’s list of protected structures. It said it was “the single most important structure” in the Brú na Bóinne site, and it suggested alterations to the plan. The house and its 430-acre site was acquired by the agri-tech company Devenish in 2013. The company runs a research farm dedicated to “sustainable agriculture” on the lands. Dowth Hall is being renovated as a family home for the company’s executive chairman Dr Owen Brennan and his wife Prof Alice Stanton and their family.The proposed alterations include restoration of the roof, the demolition and replacement of two single-storey wings and extensive renovations, to include a gym, a cinema and TV room, an orangery and sunken terraces. Meath County Council granted planning permission on November 30th, 2016, within weeks of the department’s letter. An archaeological impact assessment prepared in 2015 by Devenish’s lead archaeologist for the site, Dr Clíodhna Ní Lionáin, said the concentration of enclosures and other features in the area “strongly suggests that the immediate environs of Dowth Hall are an area of very high archaeological potential”. The extent of that potential was not discovered until archaeologists from Devenish and UCD began work on the site in May last year. Asked following the public unveiling of the burial mound on Monday if it had any ongoing or new concerns about the redevelopment of Dowth Hall, the Department of Heritage said the plan had received “all planning consents from the local authority” and that it had “no concerns about the ongoing works”.“The owners have engaged fully with the production of a conservation plan relating to Dowth Hall and the lands on the Dowth estate, including extensive geophysical surveys and research excavation in conjunction with the school of archaeology at UCD,” it added.“In terms of the discovery of the passage tomb cemetery, announced on Monday, this is being managed extremely satisfactorily and responsibly by the owners, who have followed advice and guidance given by the National Monuments Service of the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and continue to do so.”The department said the archaeological remains will be preserved in situ and that a design team was engaged in developing “a creative design to address the conservation and presentation of the passage tomb cemetery in such a way that access can be provided to the public at certain times."},{"url":null,"title":"it s a huge find megalithic passage tomb discovered in co meath","story":"  July 16, 2018Archaeologists uncover burial chambers on historic Br\u0026uacute na B\u0026oacuteinne heritage site   July 19, 2018Department warned against changes to house built above 5,000-year-old tomb "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3569502.1531949545!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"miriam lord ministers bolt for beach after being held captive in kerry","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMinister for Education Richard Bruton and Minister for Housing Eoghan Murphy make their way back from Derrynane beach in Kerry following a Cabinet meeting in Derrynane House. Photograph: Brian LawlessPA WireCloseted in a snug-fitting room for nearly six hours on a very hot day with no break for lunch, incessant talking and a sun-drenched beach winking at them from just over the hill. If ever Leo Varadkar had the makings of a Cabinet rebellion on his hands, it was on Wednesday in south Kerry.It may be the thought that counts but, under the circumstances, the Taoiseach’s idea of treating his Government Ministers to a summer away day on the shores of the Atlantic seemed more like punishment than pampering.As the Ministers squeezed into the dining room of Derrynane House, worried onlookers wondered if the large windows around the table might be opened in the event of heated exchanges. Apparently not.How Leo’s troops must have longed to escape and paddle in the warm shallows of the Atlantic. But it would be a long, long time before they would finally experience the relief of Cabinet Emancipation in Daniel O’Connell’s beloved ancestral home.On the plus side, there were no toilets. So whatever about size of the expenditure decisions being made inside the south wing, everyone had to go outside and through the courtyard to spend a penny.It was hours before they even got to hear Simon Coveney talk in exquisite detail about Brexit. Although after the Cabinet was finally liberated from the extension added to the original house in 1825 by the Liberator, the Taoiseach summed up where the Government was at, Brexitwise.“If the proverbial does hit the fan we won’t find ourselves as exposed as we were 10 years ago.”Having delighted his Cabinet with a trip to the home of one of his “historical and political heroes” for a meeting which didn’t need to be crammed in between Dáil business, everyone was up for lengthy discussion.When the meeting finally drew to a close, most of Leo’s Derrynane deliberators legged it. The Attorney General was spotted rushing out the main door, ripping his tie off in the process and unbuttoning his collar before ambling beachwards. But Séamus Wolfe was left trailing in the wake of Minister for Education Richard Bruton and Minister for Housing Eoghan Murphy (although he posted the best entry in Derrynane’s visitors book: “Up the Dubs!”).The pair of them were out on the lawn and belting for the sea before most of their sweaty colleagues had emerged. Still in their business suits, Bruton had a kit bag slung over his shoulder and Murphy was clutching his togs and a towel.By the time they climbed over the dune and reached the sand, Richard was minus his shoes and socks and Eoghan was carrying his pinstripes and wearing pink swimming shorts.There just happened, by some wonderful coincidence, to be an inidual on hand to shoot some very nice action shots of Murph running through the surf like an extra on Baywatch.The Taoiseach arrived late because he was stuck behind a tractor on the narrow road from Sneem to Derrynane. This led to unfounded rumours that the driver of the tractor was wearing a flat cap and travelling from the direction of Kilgarvan. One of the Healy-Reas was allegedly spotted lurking in the Ministers’ hotel after they arrived on Tuesday night.Before Leo arrived, Coveney gave the latest state of play on Brexit. A number of colleagues clustered around him – Minister of State Brendan Griffin, for the local angle Minister for Agriculture Michael Creed, because he isn’t seen much Minister for Business Heather Humphreys, for that vital feminine element and a smiling super-junior Finian McGrath, because he loves having his photo taken.Simon, in a nutshell: “Britain far too long negotiating internally . . . Send a clear signal . . . Best possible outcome . . . Quite frankly, we’re running out of time . . . No-deal Brexit very unlikely . . . Foolish to overreact . . . But have to prepare for all the outcomes.”The approach to adopt, he said – and this was later emphasised by the Taoiseach – is “a middle case scenario”. And if the worst comes to the worst, the Government, along with other European Union countries, will just have to “accelerate” its plans in the case of a hard Brexit.They both referred to what sounded like “sanitary and fido sanitary checks” in the aftermath of the British withdrawal. Must be something to do with pet passports and all dogs will have to be thoroughly washed as a consequence of Brexit.Actually, it may be phytosanitary checks.Most of the Cabinet had travelled to Kerry the night before. The media camped out in lovely Waterville in the Butler Arms Hotel while the politicians went to the other side of Derrynane and stayed in Sneem. (Except for Shane Ross, who likes to be different. He pitched up in Waterville too.)We hear the Taoiseach had dinner in the Park Hotel in Kenmare on Tuesday night where hotelier Francis Brennan was all aflutter with the VIP guests and flitting around like the busy bee he is, making sure all was in order for Leo and his dinner guest, the Minister for Finance.After ploughing through a very heavy agenda, the politicians didn’t have much time to look around the house, which has been wonderfully and faithfully restored by the OPW. So they didn’t see O’Connell’s death bed or the magnificent ornate chariot in the coach house. The Liberator made his triumphant progress through Dublin in it after he was released from prison in 1844.The Taoiseach hit on the idea of a Cabinet trip to Kerry on a private visit to Derrynane last September. He saw the dining room and suggested to OPW house manager Adrian Corcoran that it would make a wonderful venue for a Cabinet meeting. Leo’s speechwriter, historian Patrick Geoghegan, has written the two most recent biographies on the Liberator.The day was hard work for the politicians, but it was a rare break in the sun for their accompanying handlers and advisers, who could relax once they had committed their charges to ministerial day care.Not a month ago, Prince Charles and Camilla also visited Derrynane House. They later walked the beach, the Duchess of Cornwall walking barefoot in the sand.This time, Bruton and Murphy did the strolling. (Leo had a brief walk, but kept his shoes on.)Two fellow Irishmen as opposed to two British royals – Daniel O’Connell would have approved.The two Ministers then went swimming in dangerous currents and were ordered back to shore by the lifeguards."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3569475.1531943918!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"rent caps for purpose built student accommodation to be introduced","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Leo Varadkar said about 3,000 new “bedspaces” for students have been built in the last two years, with a further 7,000 currently under construction. Photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollins New legislation that will seek to prevent steep rises in rent paid for purpose-built student accommodation is to be introduced by the Government.Student accommodation prices in certain areas have seen increases of as much as 15 per cent, and there has been controversy over the high levels of rent paid in newly built student accommodation in Dublin and other cities.About 3,000 new “bedspaces” for students have been built in the last two years, with a further 7,000 currently under construction, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said after a Cabinet meeting in Derrynane, Co Kerry, on Wednesday. Another 7,000 have been granted planning permission.Mary Mitchell O’Connor, the Minister of State for Higher Education, is to work on Government legislation over the summer. Student accommodation is not covered by the so-called rent pressure zones, which cap rent increases to four per cent per year in designated areas.This is because such accommodation is generally operated under licences and not as tenancies, as is the case with other rented properties.“The rent pressure zones applies to tenancies but doesn’t apply to most student accommodation because that operates under licence,” the Taoiseach said.Mr Varadkar acknowledged that the main Opposition parties had brought forward Dáil bills on the issue.“As is the case with any Opposition legislation, particularly when you are a minority government, you have to respond when they are raised by the Opposition,” he said.“And this is a real issue. This student accommodation is great, it is high quality, it is brilliant that we have it. But it is expensive and we saw in some instances prices hikes of 15 and 20 per cent this year which I don’t think anyone can stand over.“What we don’t want to do though is throw the baby out with the bathwater. And the problem sometimes with legislation is that it goes too far . . . you might actually cause developers to stop building the student accommodation. The risk with the Opposition legislation is that their legislation might go too far,” he added.The Taoiseach said the cost of staying in purpose-built accommodation can be “very high”.“So we agreed to do two things. First of all, to promote digs and the rent a room scheme where there is a lot of supply and also to work over the summer on legislative proposals to limit the increases in the price of student accommodation.“We’ll work over the summer on legislation, in some way, helping to limit the increases in student accommodation so we don’t next year see the kind of increases in prices that we saw this year.”"},{"url":null,"title":"introducing telegraph new way get news","story":"Head of Digital PublishingMedia and Telecoms industryWe’ve made it even easier for you to get the news you want, when you want it. Introducing My , a new way to get the news.When you login to your  account you can now follow your favourite  writers and the subjects you’re most interested in to create a feed of news that’s just for you.Whether you want the wisdom of Charles Moore, want post-match insight from Paul Hayward or need straight-talking lifestyle advice from Bryony Gordon, the My Feed feature gives you a truly personalised experience of The .The first time you use My , we\u0027ll present a selection of popular subjects and writers to get you started.

He studied for 13 years at the Dar ul-Uloom Deoband, the most influential Muslim seminary in south Asia, speaks fluent Pashto and wears local dress.After working for the BBC\u0027s Pashto service in the 1990s and creating another popular soap called New Home, New Life, he then set up his own production house, Pact Radio, in Jalalabad in 2004.With a passion for Pashto radio and a mission to find “traditional solutions for modern problems” his soaps have in the past tackled women\u0027s rights, militancy, the rule of law and health.Health issues have also become a favourite of British soaps, with Coronation Street and The Archers recently tackling sepsis and several storylines revolving around mental health.“You can actually bring up issues in a soap opera which you can\u0027t bring up in day to day journalism,” he said.Recent plot lines have seen characters debate polio vaccination and question hearsay that drops are harmful. Extremists have preached against the global vaccination programme and health workers have been attacked in Afghanistan and Pakistan.“Pashtuns will just believe anything you tell them and that\u0027s the whole problem actually.“Whatever the facts say, they don\u0027t believe facts, they believe hearsay, they believe rumour and that\u0027s what the problem with polio is. If someone says its Bush\u0027s urine, okay it\u0027s Bush\u0027s urine.“There is a saying in Pashto that if you tell a Pashtun a dog has bitten off your ear, then the Pashtun will run after the dog, but won\u0027t check his ear to see if it\u0027s there or not.”Mr Butt still ides his time between Afghanistan and India.“It\u0027s a very infuriating country but then at the same time you feel that you are doing some good,” he said.But the country\u0027s complexities can provide great radio, he said.“You listen sometimes to The Archers and it\u0027s all \u0027the Environmental Agency is going to be coming and checking your land, because your land is contaminated\u0027 and this and that. It\u0027s really boring actually, the Archers.

I remember being absolutely riveted as a child wandering about looking at all the plants.“It was a wonderful woodland garden with masses of azaleas and rhododendrons. The smell and everything had a profound effect on me.The Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall admire vegetable produce at Alexandra Palace“Then you want to do things when you get older. And really it\u0027s only when you have something of your own that you become particularly keen.“We had as children, my sister and I, a little plot at the back of Buckingham Palace garden where we grew vegetables and things.”In 2009, it was reported that the Queen was introducing a vegetable patch to the palace grounds for the first time since the Second World War, with the young Prince and Princess gardening quite unnoticed by the public through their childhood.On the threats pests and diseases bring to British countryside, the Prince said he remembered the “totally devastating” effects of Dutch Elm disease years ago.The young Prince of Wales in the garden he created at Highgrove“Now of course we\u0027re faced by a multitude of threats of every kind of disease,” he said. “The biggest fear is we end up with a wasteland here.“Having seen more and more of these pests, particularly from the Far East, coming here. There\u0027s all these caterpillars and strange things, all with extraordinary names... One thing after another.“People love the ancient oaks in his country. There are magical remnants of some of these forests. “We are a nation of gardeners as well. But somehow people don\u0027t quite realise yet.“The difficulty I think is nurseries really are the ones that need to act quicker in terms of quarantining. I only get my trees now from a nursery which does proper quarantine, but it’s one of a minority.Prince Charles encourages Prince Harry in the Highgrove garden“Which is madness if you think about it because we should be taking a very urgent emergency approach to this. We haven\u0027t got any time to waste.”Saying he had been impressed by a visit to meet the “marvellous” border force at Heathrow Airport earlier this year, finding them “overwhelmed by endless stuff that\u0027s brought in by people in their baggage”.“I don\u0027t think people realise how dangerous it is,” he said.Taking threats seriously now, the Prince said, “will make a big difference hopefully to our future and our grandchildren, who we hope will be able to share the magic of the British landscape”.  Two children suffer bites in possible shark attacks off New York\u0026#39s Fire IslandDonald Trump in new Russian election meddling row after appearing to say US no longer being targetedAustralian nurse killed while helping victims among eight recognised for bravery during London Bridge attackWho is Maria Butina, the gun activist and student charged with spying for Russia?Russian spy offered sex for access and was praised for \u0026#39upstaging Anna Chapman\u0026#39, US prosecutors claim Troops to be compensated for Scottish tax hikes\u0026#39The money has run out\u0026#39 - health bosses\u0026#39 admission as hip and knee patients denied NHS operationsEton and Rugby to offer places to children in care under new Government-backed schemeKilled By My Debt, review: a gut-punching drama about the horrors of Britain’s gig economyPicnic at Hanging Rock, episode 2 review: an enigma wrapped in a mystery tucked inside a multi-part dramaIslamic State terrorist found guilty of plot to kill Theresa MayGovernment orders Phillip Morris to stop advertising \u0026#34healthier\u0026#34 tobacco products or face legal action Donald Trump designing \u0026#39incredible\u0026#39 new Air Force One to be red, white and blueBritish Airways: Reports of delays and cancellations at Heathrow as airline reports \u0026#39systems issue\u0026#39Thai cave rescue: Trauma expert says journalists\u0026#39 questions could affect boys\u0026#39 recoveryLaptop of Poppi Worthington\u0026#39s father that could \u0026#39solve mystery\u0026#39 of little girl\u0026#39s death discovered by police HVP vaccine likely to be rolled out for boys as officials call for \u0026#39gender-neutral\u0026#39 vaccinationsSir Cliff Richard privacy ruling: giving suspects anonymity could stop other \u0026#39victims\u0026#39 coming forward, says Theresa MayTurkey\u0026#39s emergency rule expires as President Erdogan\u0026#39s powers expandWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/07/18/TELEMMGLPICT000169570952_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqkXbkQY4xF11YSbIjVXCcoqbhEzXW48tX4Vy2uuQc4DA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"right englishman waste water","story":"Water company United Utilities has announced a hosepipe and sprinkler ban across the North West from August 5Sedges like wet places.

Because the more I beat him the more he enjoys it. The more I’m giving him satisfaction.“Heath was behaving in a very similar fashion. He was kinda egging me on. I was saying, ‘You know what, I really don’t need to actually hit you. It’s going to look just as good if I don’t.’ And he’s going, ‘Go on. Go on. Go on.\u0027“He was slamming himself around, and there were tiled walls inside of that set which were cracked and dented from him hurling himself into them, the Oscar-winning actor continued.

While much has been reported over the years about how Ledger\u0027s loyalty to the role altered his mental health before his death, his family dismissed such claims earlier this year.The Dark Knight was preceded by Batman Begins (2005) and followed by trilogy-closer The Dark Knight Rises in 2012. Dunkirk\u0026nbspfilmmaker Nolan directed both.Last year, Bale - who\u0027ll next be seen in violent western\u0026nbspHostiles - revealed that he\u0027s not a fan of his own performance in the trilogy admitting that he feels he “didn\u0027t quite nail it.”The Joker was most recently played by Jared Leto in DC film Suicide Squad with rumblings of a solo outing for the character in a new film produced by Martin Scorsese that Leto will reportedly not be a part of. \u0026nbspEnter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Born in\u0026nbspBrieg, Prussia (now Poland), he trained on piano, cello, organ and percussion.As a youth he was forced to play in\u0026nbspVolkssturm, an army band established by the Nazis in late 1944,\u0026nbspbtut\u0026nbspan inoperable injury to his hand at the age of 16 meant he had permanent tendon problems.The injury forced him to move away from playing instruments and into conducting, and was also why he never used a baton. From the\u0026nbspKimsche\u0026nbspOper\u0026nbspto Dresden Philharmonic, he led numerous orchestras and opera companies throughout the newly formed post-war East Germany.Most notably in his time in Europe, Mr\u0026nbspMasur\u0026nbspbecame leader of the Leipzig\u0026nbspGewandhaus\u0026nbspin 1970, one of the continent\u0027s most prestigious orchestras, and held the position for 26 years. Such was his influence from powerful conducting and musicianship, he convinced East German Chancellor Eric Honecker to rebuild the\u0026nbspGewandhaus\u0027 concert hall.His force of will also allowed him to overcome the challenges of the era and take the orchestra on international tours. But it was in 1989 that arguably his greatest moment would come. Political upheaval was in the air as the Soviet Union collapsed, and as thousands of Leipzig residents took to the streets to protest, Mr\u0026nbspMasur\u0026nbspwould take on a stunning public role.On 9 October he invited the masses into his orchestra\u0027s concert hall and held what was likely the first public debate East Germany had known. His cultural status had afforded Mr\u0026nbspMasur\u0026nbspa measure of soft power, but this was different. This was quite a moment for a man who had never been a member of East Germany\u0027s ruling Communist party.“No one knew what would happen, and I had only some minutes to decide .... But I also knew that if I didn\u0027t do something I would regret it for the rest of my life,” he told\u0026nbspThe Independent\u0026nbspin 1994.32101 Studio for Electronic MusicGoogle Doodle

The nature of our future trading relationship with the European Union straddles so many Tory totems from the role of business to the European Court of Justice to the border with Ireland. As a consequence an internal party “deal”\u0026nbspthat took two years to put together fell apart within two days and now we are once more the laughing stock of Europe with only a matter of months before we leave.Reforging 40 years of economic, political and societal links in a constructive, inclusive and forward-looking way would be a challenge for any government but is clearly far beyond the capacity of this one. As a government in waiting, it is Labour’s job not only to hold the government to account but to set out what our approach would be. This is the work that Keir Starmer and Labour’s Brexit team has undertaken, exemplified by the amendments our party tabled to the Great Repeal Bill. But it is also my job as shadow minister for industrial strategy to consider what Brexit means for our economic future and to place decisions in that context. And that has to mean an economic future that\u0026nbspincludes everyone, and does not merely carry over the regional and social ides that helped deliver the referendum result in the first place.To achieve this we need to look back even as we look forward. And to look outwards to the world even as we consider how best to maintain a close relationship with the European Union.The industrial landscape of Britain today is the product of a succession of industrial strategies or non-strategies, each of which was ultimately unable to deal with the reality of the larger world economy. Britain entered the 20th century hoping to maintain its position as the supplier of manufactured goods to the largest empire the world had ever known, a strategy that could not be sustained given the scale of US industry and the understandable desire of the rest of the Empire to build its own industrial base. By the 1960s, British industry was increasingly focused on our domestic market, but even that more limited “strategy”\u0026nbspproved untenable in the face of more efficient and larger scale foreign competition from the United States, Japan, Germany, Korea\u0026nbspand ultimately China.In response, the Tories under Margaret Thatcher and her successors, and to a lesser extent the 1997 Labour government, pursued a kind of “anti-industrial strategy”. This substituted first North Sea oil and then City of London financial services for industrial competitiveness. North Sea oil was a finite national asset that delivered the expected temporary economic boost. The impact of our burgeoning financial sector was more complex. It brought substantial benefits in jobs, revenues and social capital, particularly to London. It also drove the “financialisation”\u0026nbspof our economy.Financialisation\u0026nbsp– the anti-industrial strategy The way in which financialisation proved to be an anti-industrial strategy is admirably set out in leading economist Mariana Mazzucato’s new book The Value of Everything. In it she describes the “two faces of financialisation”.The first of these is the way in which the financial sector has stopped resourcing the real economy – instead of investing in companies that produce “stuff”, finance is financing finance. Why lend money to a manufacturer that may fail when you can make a bet on some options hedged with other options that virtually guarantee a return in a few weeks? The owner of a medium-sized manufacturing business gave me a striking example of this recently. His high-street bank was initially supportive when he requested a loan for new manufacturing equipment, which would significantly boost productivity. Once the bank realised that the equipment would not be something they could sell on should he go bankrupt, their interest drained away entirely. It was willing to lend based on liquidation value, but was not willing to take a risk on a living business. In a financialised economy, capital tends to flow towards standardised securities rather than actual operating businesses that present bespoke risks.But it is not only financial capital that is erted from the real economy. Human capital is sucked in too. When I graduated from Imperial College in 1987, I would estimate that only about 10 per cent of my electrical engineering cohort went into industry. The majority went into management consultancy and finance, which paid better as well as having clearer career paths. Recently the dean of an engineering department told me that was still the case and asked how I could expect engineers to go into engineering when finance paid so much better and was quite honestly the only way a graduate engineer could ever hope to buy a home in London.I responded that they should come to Newcastle where not only could they buy a lovely home on an engineer’s salary, but also be within a few minutes of some of the most beautiful countryside in the world and at the heart of a concentration of culture that rivals far bigger cities. I recognise the dean’s point – with so much financial engineering demanding money and people, real engineering doesn’t stand a chance. But it is real engineering that drives industrial productivity.Financialisation is not just a problem because it drains resources away from industry. In a financialised economy, investors with short-term horizons tend to have more control over firms. This results in less reinvestment of profits and rising burdens of debt that, in a vicious cycle, makes industry even more driven by short-term considerations. In effect, this kind of finance is not neutral but changes the nature of what it finances.This was seen just recently with the GKN takeover by “turnaround company”\u0026nbspMelrose. An estimated 20 to 25 per cent of the shares in GKN were in the hands of hedge funds, many of which were expected to back the takeover – with the firm Elliott Advisors, owning 3.8 per cent\u0026nbspof the company, explicitly doing so. The bid was won by 52 per cent to 48 per cent. And Melrose itself is not run in any long-term interest other than maximising shareholder value: it has a long history of operating as a “turnaround firm” and almost a third of its own shares are held by hedge funds. The vote was essentially a referendum about the time horizons of British industry, and Britain lost.So when bankers and chancellors talk of having learned\u0026nbspthe lessons of the financial crisis they are wrong both at the macro and micro level. With UK national debt twice what it was in 2007 and household debt to disposable income at a record high, 10 years after the crash of\u0026nbspthe global economy, finance is once again at the heart of an existential threat to our way of life.Financialisation and inequality Even before the crash, this “anti-industrial strategy”\u0026nbspdrove social and geographic inequalities. Levels of income inequality as measured by the Gini coefficient reached a pre-crash peak of 0.35 in the 1990s and, while improving slightly, remained high in comparison to the Sixties throughout the 2000s. Regional inequality was also a significant feature of the pre-crash economy, with data from the National Institute of Economic and Social Research showing a gradual rise throughout the 2000s in the difference in gross household income between regions. In 2005, average household income in the North East was 14 per cent below the UK average, while in London it was 20 per cent higher.Gini Coefficient 1961-2016 – 1 is the most unequal score, 0 is the most equal\u0026nbsp(Institute for Fiscal Studies)The Tories were either indifferent to these inequalities or at best felt they were an acceptable price to pay. Labour, under previous leaderships, believed that redistributive policies could make it all come out right in the end, and flagship programmes such as Sure Start and working tax credits certainly helped. But both approaches were fundamentally mistaken. Financialisation turned out to be a house built on sand – unable to generate enough wealth to compensate for the abandonment of the rest of the economy, and vulnerable to boom and bust cycles. Ultimately, the financial crisis of 2008 and the global economic crisis it spawned showed that the ideology of finance – that financial markets and institutions, left to themselves and the profit motive, would efficiently allocate capital – was a pernicious fantasy.British industry—creating real value in the real economyBut that was not the whole story. While\u0026nbspmetropolitan London came to comprise 40 per cent\u0026nbspof the British economy – and a 40 per cent\u0026nbspheavily dependent on finance and professional services – something else was happening in the rest of the country. Britain’s entry into the European Union, and the survival in parts of Britain of a culture favourable to engineering and manufacturing, fostered the growth of certain sectors of British industry as part of a larger integrated European industrial base. The supply chains of large European firms such as Airbus, Boeing and BMW are substantially British. Nissan’s Sunderland plant is the final destination for parts manufactured across Europe and produces more cars per worker than any other factory in the European Union. And GKN, itself one of the world’s oldest engineering firms, is a key supplier to international aerospace and automotive firms – including European giant Airbus, which warned against the Melrose takeover. Factories engaged in producing components and sub-assemblies and assembling components from elsewhere in Europe are now critical to the prosperity of much of Britain. Figure 1 shows just one of BMW’s many supply chains.Such integration requires frictionless borders but also agreed standards to define everything from the acceptable frequency of electromagnetic radiation to the atomic composition of a given chemical. Leaving the European Union will not mean less regulation simply more duplication. As they scramble to recreate existing EU agencies and regulations, businesses and government departments are realising that far from Brussels bureaucracy being imposed upon Britain, the European Union was effectively based on the “shared back office services”\u0026nbspmodel that Whitehall now champions for local government.In many ways, British agriculture has followed a similar trajectory to British car manufacturing, where British farmers have been able to successfully compete on both quality and price in markets defined by EU food safety rules. For example, British farmers export far more wheat flour to the EU – approximately 250,000 tonnes last year – than they do to non-EU countries – approximately 6,000 tonnes. The same goes for other agricultural products such as barley (one\u0026nbspmillion tonnes versus 50,000 tonnes) and oats (16,000 tonnes versus 4,000 tonnes).The EU is the largest importer and exporter of food in the world. As an EU member state, our farmers have benefited from preferential access to this market through exemptions from the tariffs and quotas imposed on non-member countries. And with 85 per cent of seasonal agricultural workers in the UK coming from Bulgaria and Romania, agriculture is one of the UK sectors most heavily dependent on freedom of movement.Food and drink is Britain’s largest manufacturing sector and Europe’s complex rules of origin guidelines could lead to a “hidden hard Brexit”\u0026nbsprequiring the restructuring of food manufacturing supply chains even if we secure preferential access.\u0026nbspAgriculture and manufacturing are both more important outside of London and particularly around the very market towns that have been most “left behind” by the new economy.As Britain contemplates how to engage with the world before, during and after Brexit, we need to understand the trade policy choices we make will drive the shape of our economy and are therefore also industrial policy choices, choices that will shape the very nature of what work we do, the health of our communities\u0026nbspand the way we live for decades to come.  The benefits of a customs union The Labour Party is united in supporting a customs union with Europe. We believe it will bolster our current industrial strengths and offer the possibility of continued industrial revival in certain sectors. We should not be complacent about this approach. Our place in the larger European manufacturing economy will still depend on our ability to innovate and to invest, so that British firms successfully manage and not just participate in supply chains. And this will depend on our learning the lessons of the financial crisis so that our financial markets and institutions actually invest in productive sectors.Unfortunately, the government continues to act as if the only issues in financial regulation are safety, soundness and fraud. While these are obviously important issues, they completely miss the question of whether our financial system is effectively channelling capital to productive and innovative investment. And this is the whole point of a financial system. A financial system that simply parks money in risk-free assets or honestly gambles on sporting events, would meet the characteristics the Tories have established but would still be a total failure. As Mazzucato argues, the traditional policies we have seen create a “healthy financial sector (bailed out, ring-fenced, and restructured) in a deeply sick economy”.Implications for industrial strategy of the alternativesLast week’s visit by President Trump to Britain revealed that he thinks the UK-US relationship is “the highest level of special”. Arch Brexiteers argue that he offers an alternative to a customs union with Europe: a free trade agreement with the United States, which, as a consequence of Nafta\u0026nbspwould really be a free trade agreement with all of North America. But while\u0026nbspthe US economy is of comparable size to the EU in GDP terms, $19 trillion (£14 trillion)\u0026nbspcompared to $17 trillion, they have different sectoral compositions and regulatory standards. Going in this direction would lead to substantial changes in the structure of the British economy.Earlier this year, trade experts at Harvard University published a report that included a candid assessment of obstacles to a US-UK free trade agreement. Its authors, including former shadow chancellor Ed Balls, reached the conclusion that it is “highly unlikely that a free trade deal between the US and the UK will be secured in the near term”\u0026nbspand, in addition, “the likely potential benefits for British businesses are less than often suggested”.The report focused on likely US demands for access to British food markets and likely British demands for access for British firms to US financial and professional services markets. These demands map the likely direction a US-UK free trade agreement would take both countries. Britain is attractive to the US as a market for agricultural products and for goods manufactured through US-controlled supply chains. Britain is also seen by some as a source of relatively low cost financial and professional services. Without an EU customs union, American business does not see Britain as a manufacturing platform – British wages are too high given the distance to the North American market. Labour costs per hour in manufacturing are on average £27 in the US and £23 in the UK – a £4 difference that does not compensate for transport costs.In a UK detached from the European market, the role of British industry in European supply chains will therefore not be replaced by similar roles in US-based supply chains. This is the critical point for UK manufacturing – we cannot replace European supply chain integration with North American supply chain integration.In addition, if British food safety rules are relaxed as part of a trade deal with the US, it is likely that cheap American agricultural products will significantly displace British agriculture. So we will eat chlorinated chicken from Arkansas, bake with GM flour from Dakota\u0026nbspand barbecue antibiotic drenched beef from Illinois. US farming is largely in the hands of mega industrial organisations. Agriculture is a much greater proportion of US GDP than it is of UK GDP. There are farms in Texas that are bigger than major UK counties – 500 square miles, for example. We cannot compete with agriculture on that scale without harming our landscape and bioersity, especially given that we already use substantially more of our land in percentage terms on agriculture than does the US. If our markets are opened up to US agricultural products, UK farming will either adapt to US food safety practices and scale or our agriculture will diminish greatly. If we were to follow the bidding of the arch-Brexiteers and take the US as our model partner it would be the end of our landscape and bioersity as we currently know it.In the place of agriculture and industry, there will be a US market for British financial services and other professional services such as\u0026nbsplaw, accountancy and management consulting. However, just as we have seen the integration of British manufacturing into European firms, we will likely see a wave of mergers and acquisitions in services as British firms are acquired by US firms seeking to serve the US market with British professionals. As a consequence, while\u0026nbspmanufacturing and agriculture would suffer, services and finance might not remain in British hands, especially given the current takeover regime that substantially limits the scope for government protection of UK businesses.A Britain without a customs union with the EU and with a free trade agreement with the US would have less industry, less agriculture, but more finance and more service sector jobs. It would likely be a Britain of growing regional and social disparities, and a Britain more vulnerable to financial instability. After all, it was the high concentration of financial services in the UK economy that meant we were hit particularly hard by the last financial crisis. If the UK economy consolidates further around finance, then we will become even more vulnerable.Turning from North America some look to the Commonwealth as an alternative future that harks to our past. We have strong ties to English-speaking Commonwealth countries around the world – economic ties as well as ties of language, immigration and history. In a digital world, we have the possibility of building networks of innovation that could contribute both to our own industrial competitiveness as well as the competitiveness of our partners.Countries as erse as Nigeria, Australia and India are all racing to be centres of technological innovation and to solve pressing problems in areas such as energy and education. In a sense, if we are open to our former colonies as partners, and generous with access to our own centres of innovation, we could perhaps create alternative pathways to competitiveness for our industry.But those same countries have requested access to the UK through preferential visa arrangements as part of any free trade agreement. India has requested an increase in the number of visas issued to skilled Indian workers and allow students to stay for longer after graduating, but so far government has refused calls to relax visa rules even within the current framework. Australia and other Commonwealth countries want their citizens to be granted the same rights as Europeans: to live and work in the UK after Brexit.Building a competitive commonwealth innovation network effectively requires the opposite of our current attitudes towards the Global South. Commonwealth leaders have criticised the government’s – reported – characterisation of post-Brexit trade as ‘Empire 2.0’. This was reflected in our treatment of the Windrush generation, which, in a sense, like our approach to Brexit, threatens to close critical doors to a better future for British industry and for Britain as a whole.Whether we look to North America or the Commonwealth, into our past or forward to the type of economy we want to become, the arguments bring us back to a customs union with the EU and an industrial strategy that will help rebalance the economy and provide the directed investment to get it growing again. The billions poured by the Bank of England into quantitative easing have signally failed to do this.A Labour government would invest £250bn over 10 years through our National Transformation Fund, and set up a National Investment Bank, as well as a network of regional development banks to channel investment into productive enterprises across the country, unlocking productivity and creating growth.Royal family release official photos from Prince Louis’s christeningPrince William and Prince Charles ‘refused to meet Trump’A history of tense meetings between US and Russian presidentsWe need to understand as we approach critical decision points around our trade policy and our financial regulatory policy\u0026nbspthat these are choices that will shape not just our relations with the outside world but Britain itself – that choices labelled trade policy or immigration policy or financial regulatory policy are in fact industrial policy, agricultural policy and economic policy.The Tory party ideologues are in no state to set out a vision for our future economy, far less to rationally assess the policies needed to make it a reality. Financialisation has proven to be an economic dead-end, creating wealth for the few at the expense of social equality, regional balance and long-term productivity growth.To build a more competitive and equal Britain post-Brexit we need a deal that strengthens our productive sectors such as manufacturing rather than one that deepens financialisation and risks our long-term prosperity. We also need a real industrial strategy based on our regional strengths that enables investment in the productive economy, delivering jobs in our towns as well as our cities that creates value regionally and nationally that can be shared by all.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Ever since the first dino fossils were discovered in the early 19th\u0026nbspcentury, we have been desperate to know as much as we possibly can\u0026nbspabout these remarkable creatures. And as our knowledge grows, so our perceptions change.Imagine that time travel had been invented, and that for a limited time this summer you could journey back 67 million years\u0026nbspto the Late Cretaceous and the Age of the Dinosaurs, to see animals like triceratops and tyrannosaurus\u0026nbsproaming free in the landscape around you.Such is the opening premise of Dinosaurs in the Wild, a unique, immersive and\u0026nbspinteractive visitor attraction based at the Greenwich Peninsula, in London, until 2 September. I have been involved as the scientific consultant. Our aim with this experience is to present an absolutely modern, science-based view of dinosaurs and their world – and I’m pleased to say it has won critical praise from the palaeontologists, palaeoartists and other experts who’ve visited so far. However, things are a bit weirder than you might imagine.It’s the look of our dinosaurs, created using the latest photo-real computer generated imagery,\u0026nbspthat most strikes visitors. The creatures are boldly patterned, brightly coloured, often fuzzy, feathery or spiny, and with unusual features that make their fleshy outlines different from their skeletons. These aren’t the dinosaurs your parents or grandparents would have seen in the books or exhibitions of previous generations. Nor are they even the dinosaurs of cinema’s most notable dinosaur-themed outing, 1993’s Jurassic Park, nor of its sequels (including 2015’s Jurassic World and 2018’s Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom).Indeed, this week marks the 25th anniversary of Jurassic Park’s UK cinema release, and even now it has to be considered a milestone event in cinema. It took CGI, robotics and model-making to a new level, wowing audiences with the innovations and craftmanship of Steven Spielberg’s team, Stan Winston Studio and Industrial Light and Magic.And from the perspective of science education as well, Jurassic Park was a major score. Gone were the solitary, tail-dragging, Godzilla-like monsters of yore. Instead we saw complex, group-living animals that walk and run like birds, keep their tails up off the ground, and are smart enough to ambush humans and negotiate the interiors of buildings.In bringing this science-based view of dinosaurs to the silver screen, Spielberg naturally worked with expert consultants. The result was that the view of dinosaurs that emerged among palaeontologists during the late 1960s – a scientific and cultural event known as the Dinosaur Renaissance – found a new audience. So significant and inspirational was Jurassic Park’s scientifically informed view of dinosaurs that many professionals working on dinosaurs and other ancient animals today trace their nascent interest in the subject to the movie.But if Jurassic Park was so on the ball, why are the dinosaurs in the new\u0026nbspDinsosaurs of the Wild attraction so very different? The answer is that much has changed in the past few decades in our scientific understanding of dinosaurs. So much so that 1993 feels like a long time ago, with the result that Jurassic Park’s dinosaurs are now surprisingly dated.Notably, the people behind Jurassic Park opted not to feather their dinosaurs, specifically the bird-like predator deinonychus (called velociraptor in the movie). There are two takes on this issue. One is that the scientists of the early 1990s didn’t have sufficient fossil evidence to run with the idea of feathery dinosaurs. After all, a feathered, non-bird dinosaur fossil didn’t show up until 1996 (the term “non-bird dinosaur” is now a necessity given that birds are dinosaurs in the same way that primates are mammals). That fossil is the original specimen of sinosauropteryx, a small, long-tailed predator that lived in eastern China around 130 million years ago.But a second take is that, although the idea of feathery non-bird dinosaurs was looking really, really likely even in 1992-93 (the skeletons of early birds like Archaeopteryx and near-bird dinosaurs like deinonychus and velociraptor are extremely similar), the technological limitations of the time and Spielberg’s argument that a feathery deinonychus just wouldn’t look scary led Jurassic Park’s creators to play it safe.Two and half decades on and hundreds of feathered dinosaur fossils have now been unearthed from the same region that yielded sinosauropteryx. These and other fossils found in recent times show that feathers and feathery-like filaments, quills and fuzz were widespread across the large group of bird-like, mostly predatory dinosaurs called coelurosaurs. Among this group are the tyrannosaurs. So – should tyrannosaurs be fuzzy or feathery as well?The 2016 discovery of a giant, fuzz-covered tyrannosaur in China – the nine-metre long yutyrannus – proves that big tyrannosaurs were indeed, just like their smaller cousins, in which case even the gigantic tyrannosaurus should be reconstructed with a fuzzy coat. Based on this evidence, the tyrannosaurus at Dinosaurs in the Wild has feathering across at least some of its upper surface. But this idea has since been contested: some experts argue that skin impressions show how tyrannosaurus and kin underwent an evolutionary transition back to scaly skin. Argument here continues and more data is needed.Dinosaurs were flamboyant, showy creatures. Frills, crests and horns on the head and sails and spines along the back were commonplace. Similar structures in living animals – cattle, deer, beetles and chameleons – are associated with sexual display and with battles that occur during the breeding season. Combine this with the fact that dinosaurs almost definitely had excellent colour vision – an inference based on eyesight in their living relatives – and the Age of Dinosaurs was surely flashy, colourful, even gaudy.Jurassic Park and Jurassic World again opted to be conservative, there being much grey and mud brown but little else. We very much went for the opposite in Dinosaurs in the Wild. Our triceratops has red striping across its face and enormous bony frill, our tyrannosaurs have bright red faces used in signalling and intimidation, and our feathery dakotaraptor is patterned in black and white and has a red forehead.Hard evidence for the colours of dinosaurs is rare but does at least exist: microscopic cellular structures termed melanosomes were reported from dinosaur fossils in 2010 and have so far been identified in around eight non-bird dinosaurs. They reveal evidence for colours, patterns and even iridescence on the feathers and skin of select species, and more such discoveries are sure to be forthcoming now that experts know what to look for.New thinking also has it that dinosaurs were not just gaudy and colourful. As explained in the 2012 book All Yesterdays, both the anatomy of living animals and a number of “known unknowns” and “unknown unknowns” (thanks, Rumsfeld) render it likely that dinosaurs were sometimes weirder in anatomy than long thought. Air-filled sacs distributed throughout the body and skeleton, enormous bony hollows surrounding the nostrils and evidence for big masses of erectile tissue on the face suggest that some dinosaurs had inflatable or erectile wattles, dewlaps, sacs and other structures. This sounds odd but such structures are present in many modern birds and would be hard or impossible to predict if we only knew these animals from their bones.It’s for this reason that the gigantic, armour-plated ankylosaurus in our vision possesses inflatable facial structures best described as cheek balloons.\u0026nbspSurprising yet plausible features like this may well have been commonplace across the dinosaur world.Finally, what about behaviour? The Jurassic franchise has always made nods to the idea – made scientifically robust during the Dinosaur Renaissance – that dinosaurs of many sorts were more social and behaviourally complex than the solitary brutes of convention.Fossil nests discovered in the 1970s showed that dinosaurs of several sorts nested colonially, that nest-building and nest-care were common, and that at least some species guarded their babies and even provisioned them with food. Baby dinosaurs preserved away from the nest environment are typically found in groups and are sometimes found in association with the remains of an adult.And both tracks and assemblages of skeletons show that many dinosaurs lived in groups, ranging from twos or threes in big predators to tens or hundreds in the case of many plant-eaters. It remains open to debate as to whether\u0026nbspdeinonychus and its kin used the coordinated group-hunting portrayed in Jurassic Park, but the door is certainly open for social behaviour of many kinds.One very specific behavioural nugget does separate Jurassic Park from Dinosaurs in the Wild. Our dinosaurs don’t roar like lions. Roaring with a wide-open mouth seems normal to us, because we’re mammals. But dinosaurs aren’t mammals, and if we look at their closest living relatives – crocodylians and big birds like emus and ostriches – we see that loud sounds are made with a closed mouth, the noises emanating from the throat and chest.Dinosaurs in the Wild Dinosaurs in the WildDinosaurs in the WildPair of QuetzalcoatlusDinosaurs in the WildDinosaurs in the WildDinosaurs in the WildDinosaurs in the WildChronotex X90 with an AlamosaurusDinosaurs in the WildTyrannosaurus and geyserDinosaurs in the WildDinosaurs in the WildTimebase 67 and a QuetzalcoatlusDinosaurs in the Wildriceratops with a Chronotex X90Dinosaurs in the WildDinosarus in the WildDinosaurs in the WildDinosaurs in the WildPair of QuetzalcoatlusDinosaurs in the WildDinosaurs in the WildDinosaurs in the WildDinosaurs in the WildChronotex X90 with an AlamosaurusDinosaurs in the WildTyrannosaurus and geyserDinosaurs in the WildDinosaurs in the WildTimebase 67 and a QuetzalcoatlusDinosaurs in the Wildriceratops with a Chronotex X90Dinosaurs in the WildDinosarus in the WildMaybe this is an example of science ruining something that seems awesome and dramatic. Or maybe this is one of those cases where we benefit by having our assumptions corrected by discovery where we learn that nature is sometimes different from that which we might expect.Add all of this together, and science is revealing a colourful, vibrant, complex Age of Dinosaurs quite different from the one imagined back when Jurassic Park was under production. Dinosaurs in the Wild\u0026nbsppresents the scientific state of the art as it stands in 2018. But much remains to be discovered and a scientific attraction constructed decades from now may well look even more remarkable.Dr Darren Naish is a palaeontologist and scientific consultant at Dinosaurs in the Wild.\u0026nbspHaving thrilled time travellers in Birmingham and Manchester, the experience is now established at a custom-built home on London’s Greenwich Peninsula, a short walk from\u0026nbspNorth Greenwich Underground station,\u0026nbspuntil 2 September.

With an estimated worth of $1bn, a trade body and a recognised marketing award, they have finally been tamedClick to followThe Independent OnlinePep talk: Kendall Jenner’s Pepsi advert was pulled shortly after it aired for appearing to trivialise demonstrations tackling social causesLast month, the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity –\u0026nbspthe biggest grouping of advertising and marketing people you could ever hope to avoid –\u0026nbspintroduced a new award: the Social and Influencer\u0026nbspcategory.Yes, those\u0026nbspgurning thumb-flexers forever punching #YOLO, #instacool and #nofilter into their smartphones as they plug products have come of age.\u0026nbspInfluencer-dom is now a fully-fledged industry. Yet only a year or two ago we were told by many (rather gleefully in some cases) that the influencer was dead or at least in crisis.Earlier this year, this seemed to be confirmed as the owner of the White Moose Cafe in Dublin turned the tables on\u0026nbsp22-year-old YouTube vlogger and influencer Elle Darby, by exposing her demand for five free hotel nights in return for exposure.His public burn spoke for many: “If I let you stay here in return for a feature in a video, who is going to pay the staff who look after you?” The twitter-mob turned on influencers. Who were they? How do they get away with it? Do they actually earn money?When the influencer marketing industry began (around 2008-10, attest the form’s historians) the notion took hold that like celebrity endorsement before it, aspirational people could become marketing tools, accessing the consumer mind as if a recommendation from a friend.YouTuber with 139,095 subscribers, was refused a free hotel stay (YouTubeElle Darby)As one observer put it:\u0026nbsp“They emerged almost overnight and in 10 years have gone from a small network to a worldwide community.” Some sources suggest that there is now a baseline of 1.1 million influencers worldwide.\u0026nbspMediakix estimated\u0026nbspthe industry was worth more than $1bn\u0026nbsp(£750m)\u0026nbspin 2017. Malcolm Gladwell’s coinage, “the tipping point”, was used a lot in meetings.\u0026nbspBy about 2014, a baffled world had started to understand influencer marketing, but the industry’s breakthrough year was probably 2016 when, as Hamda Issa-Salwe of Bravado, part of Universal Music Group, found when she did a research thesis called Investigating the Use of Influencer Marketing on Social Media.“It began to soar,” she says. “Google classified ‘influencer’ as a breakout keyword with a 5,000 per cent month by month increase in the number of times the search term ‘influencer marketing’ was typed.”Also in 2016, it was established that Kendall Jenner was paid an estimated $300,000 per social media post. Advertising agencies took more careful notice of influencers and Instagram –\u0026nbspfounded in 2010 – became the key station of the social media cross, along with other key platforms\u0026nbspsuch as YouTube, Snapchat and Pinterest.Even the fustiest legacy-media type can now see the point. The barrier to entry is low. All you need is a smartphone and a certain brio. And the research seems to add up. According to Nielsen, 84 per cent\u0026nbspof consumers trust opinions from people they know, while 70 per cent\u0026nbsptake action based on other consumer’s opinions online.vlogger Zoella reportedly has a net worth of £2.5m (InstagramZoella)The Association of National Advertisers found that 75 per cent\u0026nbspof members already work with influencers, and the growing industry will take 20 per cent\u0026nbspof the total global marketing budget by 2023.No wonder that 82 per cent\u0026nbspof millennials hope to become influencers at least, according to a survey by London-based dating app CLiKD.\u0026nbspSo the money’s talking, and influencers can do well.It seems a great life but you don’t want to be that person with a fridgeful of isotonic drinks and unable to pay the rentAs Anthony Svirskis, CEO\u0026nbspof TRIBE and a juror on the\u0026nbspSocial and Influencer award says:\u0026nbsp“On a post by post basis, brands should expect to pay £50 for someone with 3,000 followers and upwards of £300 if someone has more than 100,000 followers.” Small wonder the market is seething with aspirant influencers.\u0026nbspYet influencers are still derided as being without any particular skills: even that they’re the apotheosis of the entitled “Me” generation, spreading paid-for blandishments in vocal-fry vlogs on YouTube.While it’s hard to blame someone who travels the world in return for Instagram snaps, is there an influencer bubble waiting to burst? Paul Dyer, of marketing company Lippe Taylor, believes it will, as trust has disappeared from the sector in the sceptical Facebook-Cambridge Analytica era.“There is tremendous value in influencer marketing,” he said recently. “However, many current practices are only speeding us to the precipice where the bottom falls out.”Indeed, there have been several influencer #epicfails, perhaps the most notable being\u0026nbspFyre\u0026nbspFestival, the ill-fated 2017 Bahamas musical festival that paid Kendall Jenner and Bella\u0026nbspHadid\u0026nbspto drum up support.\u0026nbspFyre\u0026nbspbombed and the repercussions are ongoing.There’s also an undergrowth of freebie-hunting influencers harassing hotels and providers. Some hotels – the\u0026nbspDusit\u0026nbspThani\u0026nbspresort in the Males among them – now use weeding out processes. “When they work hotels love them,” says one travel PR.\u0026nbspThe influencer economy … is a market irrationality. Companies are self-correcting in the face of so much wasted money“Influencers are uncritical and often share films and photographs that would otherwise be paid for. But there’s a trust problem.”There are other cracks in the influencer edifice as brands begin to ask questions about the business efficacy of influencers. As publicist Mark Borkowski says:\u0026nbsp“More brands are beginning to realise that influencer activity doesn’t necessarily drive ROI.”And the pain is on both sides, he adds. “It seems a great life but you don’t want to be that person with a fridgeful of isotonic drinks and unable to pay the rent.” Anti-influencers are coming of the woodwork –\u0026nbspand they’re not all crusty oldies with a grudge.“The influencer economy … is a market irrationality,” wrote Sam Biddle of Gawker in 2016. “Companies are self-correcting in the face of so much wasted money.” As for bots and fake followers, that’s a real problem.Fyre Festival attendees locked in airport ‘for their own safety’At Cannes, Unilever’s chief marketing officer Keith Weed called for industry action to clean out the influencer stable, and vowed never to use influencers found to be buying followers.So the sands are shifting. Hamda Issa-Salwe says that while influencer activity remains hard to define and audit, it’s still growing. Although trust and authenticity (the great influencer bon mot) are major factors, brands still spend a lot on influencers: after all,\u0026nbspInstagram has more 800 million monthly active users.And the influencers themselves are fighting back. It’s a new industry: of course legacy dinosaurs wouldn’t get it. It’s just another marketing tool. And what are –\u0026nbspsorry, were –\u0026nbspnewspapers half the time, but a vehicle of paid-for information?“Indeed, there’s a growing distrust of traditional media advertising,” says Harry Hugo, cofounder at The Goat Agency, Europe’s leading influencer agency, which claims to be growing at a rate of 600 per cent\u0026nbspa year.“Just look at the rise in ad blockers, investigations into media transparency and big networks like WPP struggling. Influencers can be one of the most trusted, and therefore highest converting, information sources for people.”\u0026nbspAlso, we jeremiahs just don’t get the craft and graft that goes into an influencer’s brand persona, adds Florencia Lujani, influencer marketing manager at agency We Are Social London.“People struggle to see why brands would pay money to partner with influencers for something which appears relatively simple,” she says. “But it takes time and effort, talent, passion and commitment.”\u0026nbspAnd even the thorny issue of disclosure –\u0026nbspthat is, whether you should know what someone is being paid to promote –\u0026nbspis a smaller issue than is often supposed, says Svirskis. “Influencers are very compliant of requirements to disclose and are often represented by an influencer agency.”There is tremendous value in influencer marketing. However, many current practices are only speeding us to the precipice where the bottom falls outMost importantly of all, influencers make money for clients. Currently, the average ROI of influencer marketing is £7 back for every £1 spent, says Amelia Neate of Influencer Champions.\u0026nbspSo,\u0026nbspdo you have to be pretty? “It’s definitely not reserved for those with looks,” says Svirskis. “The cheesy smiles are long gone.” It’s about style and tone, he says, and as the industry matures it’s moving beyond lifestyle products like travel, beauty and fashion to finance, automotive –\u0026nbspeven dog food.“There are new influencers emerging every day, in every single vertical,” says Lujani. They’re marshalling themselves into communities: mummy bloggers, healthy eaters, sports fans – why, possibly even news organisations.\u0026nbspWith the maturation of the influencer world comes a shakeout: Influencer 2.0, if you will. Sheer numbers don’t matter so much anymore.\u0026nbspThe smart talk is now about engagement and micro-influencers,\u0026nbspthose with fewer than 100,000 followers and possibly as low as 5,000, but with proper peer recognition.\u0026nbspYouTuber Alfie Deyes came under fire for his recent video, ‘How I lived off £1 for a day’ (YouTubePointlessBlogVlogs)“Data shows that influence by measure of engagement actually increases as the audience size reduces,” says Svirskis. In a hedge-betting strategy, brands now prefer to work with 50 micro-influencers rather than one mega-influencer, and brands are taking influencer management in-house as influencer marketing moves into the mainstream.If children are obese then blame food manufacturers, not ZoellaInvestigation promised into Trump campaign data firmThree arrested after Facebook group raid cannabis field – only to Sexist men who abuse women on Facebook and Twitter are compensating“Most new industries go through periods of turbulence as they form foundations,” says Svirskis, who thinks that many of today’s influencers will become tomorrow’s creative directors and entrepreneurs.He has a point. Beauty influencer Emily Weiss now has a cosmetic company, Glossier, and within the last couple of weeks M\u0026ampC Saatchi bought a stake in two influencer agencies. There’s even a new trade body, the Influencer Marketing Association.Circle the wagons and don’t be a #filterfaker\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspthe wild influencer west is being tamed.Cannes Lions International Festival of CreativityEnter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Just a few hours to go until tonight\u0027s\u0026nbspLove Island.\u0026nbspIn case you missed it, Charlie and Ellie are the latest islanders to be kicked out, to the disappointment of...well nobody really.Somewhat impressively, Georgia has managed to single handedly\u0026nbspsplit the internet in two. Like Barack Obama looking through a window at some children, she has broken Twitter.\u0026nbspLet\u0027s break the warring factions down. On one side we have Team Georgia, and the other we have...well, Team Anti-Georgia.\u0026nbspTAG are judging Georgia for deciding to breakup with Sam and stay in the villa (therefore still in with a shot at the £50k, even though we know that money is obviously Dani Dyer\u0027s). They think she should\u0027ve left the villa in a display of undying love for Sam. TG, however, are rallying online to her defence, saying that Georgia in fact wanted to leave in a move of dignity, and it was actually Sam who convinced her. TG also say\u0026nbspshe has been a victim of harsh editing (remember Samira, anybody?).\u0026nbspSo which team are you on?Four new Islanders entered the villa last night. First up we have 23-year-old Stephanie Lam, who I must admit made so little impact I can\u0027t remember anything else about her.Our last two new contestants are Paul Knops (who was, fun fact, in Britney\u0027s\u0026nbspMake Me video, so he is obviously now our favourite) and DJ and model Josh Mair.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspI don\u0027t think I realised quite how many DJs and models there are in the world until I watched\u0026nbspLove Island.Apparently s*** is going to hit the fan for Jack and Laura tonight which is not good news.

In its first annual Media Nations report, Ofcom credited Netflix and Amazon\u0027s focus on creating original content for its subscribers as a key driver of growth.More than a third of Netflix (38 per cent) subscribers cite ‘to watch original series made by the provider’ as a reason for signing up (up from 30 per cent\u0026nbspin Q1 2017), the report stated.Sharon White, Ofcom’s chief executive, said: “Today’s research finds that what we watch and how we watch it are changing rapidly, which has profound implications for UK television.\u0026nbspWe have seen a decline in revenues for pay TV, a fall in spending on new programmes by our public service broadcasters, and the growth of global video streaming giants. These challenges cannot be underestimated.She added:\u0026nbsp“But UK broadcasters have a history of adapting to change. By making the best British programmes and working together to reach people who are turning away from TV, our broadcasters can compete in the digital age.”The latest\u0026nbspfigures from Ofcom do not take into account people watching shows and films through illegal streaming platforms, which has become a constantly evolving battle for copyright holders, broadcasters and regulators.Today\u0027s figures from Ofcom are a landmark on the road we have been walking down for a long time, said Chris Anderson, head of film and TV at digital piracy authority MUSO.\u0026nbspIn reality, with piracy figures considered, streaming probably overtook traditional TV long ago – but piracy audiences are overlooked by TV broadcasters, streaming services, and regulators to their detriment.Figures from MUSO\u0026nbspshow that global piracy has increased year-on-year, with more than 4 billion visits to film and TV piracy sites in the UK in 2017.While it may seem counter intuitive, Mr Anderson suggests the traditional broadcasting industry should look to viewers lost to illegal piracy sites in order to better compete against the legitimate streaming services like Amazon and Netflix.If UK broadcasters are serious about their mission to adapt their revenue streams to compete in the digital age, they need to not only consider the audiences lost to legitimate streaming services but also illegitimate ones, he said.Piracy audiences are one of the great untapped pools of wealth - they have extremely high intent to access content but are often simply unable to. Finding ways to access this audience could be the secret bringing higher profits back to broadcasting.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Many scientists have argued that while the name is eye-catching, it lacks the geological evidence to back it up.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Some have suggested advances in technology and society have essentially displaced many of the functions of religion, while others argued the so-called “Protestant work ethic” contributed to the development of capitalism.A link between religion and wealth has been known about for decades, as researchers have observed that the poorest nations tend to be highly religious.While the new research does not demonstrate a causal link between lack of godliness and economic development, it suggests that wealth is not in itself the cause of secularisation.Our findings show that secularisation precedes economic development and not the other way around,” said Damian Ruck, the study\u0027s lead researcher at the University of Bristol.“However, we suspect the relationship is not directly causal. We noticed that secularisation only leads to economic development when it is accompanied by a greater respect for inidual rights.”Science news in picturesScientists have witnessed the birth of a planet for the first time ever. 224 New human organ discovered that was previously missed by scientistsLayers long thought to be dense, connective tissue are actually a series of fluid-filled compartments researchers have termed the “interstitium”. 324 Previously unknown society lived in Amazon rainforest before Europeans arrived, say archaeologistsWorking in the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso, a team led by archaeologists at the University of Exeter unearthed hundreds of villages hidden in the depths of the rainforest. 424 One in 10 people have traces of cocaine or heroin on fingerprints, study findsMore than one in 10 people were found to have traces of class A drugs on their fingers by scientists developing a new fingerprint-based drug test.524 Nasa releases stunning images of Jupiter\u0027s great red spotThe storm bigger than the Earth, has been swhirling for 350 years.

The fragment of jaw bone provides evidence of an east-west ide in the evolution of dinosaurs on the North American continent. During the Late Cretaceous period, 66 to 100 million years ago, the land mass was split into two continents by a shallow sea. This sea, the Western Interior Seaway, ran from the Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic Ocean.

Religious institutions need to find their own way of modernising and respecting the rights of iniduals.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

There is a glaring lack of black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) staff at senior civil service levels across the community.“And although 31 per cent of the senior civil servants in MI5 are women, that figure is considerably lower – around 25 per cent – across the other agencies and rest of the intelligence community” the MPs said.The report stated that only GCHQ, the government’s communications headquarters, have any black or Asians in the senior category. However, after its publication, MI5 wanted to point out that ethnic minority members have moved to senior positions in the last year.Dominic Grieve, chairman of the ISC, said: “In an increasingly competitive employment market, it is important that the UK intelligence community is able to attract, and draw upon, the skill, talent and experience of all sectors of our society – to reflect, protect and promote our values, and keep our nation safe.“It is essential that these organisations reflect the UK of today with a erse and inclusive workforce. Diversity encourages challenge, drives innovation and ensures better decision making – whilst this is important in any organisation or sector, it is an operational imperative for the intelligence community.”The ISC report looked at ersity and inclusivity\u0026nbspat MI6, MI5, GCHQ, Defence Intelligence Agency, The Office for Security and Counter-Terrorism (OSCT), National Security Secretariat (NSS) and Joint Intelligence Organisation (JIO) in compiling the report.MI6 release first advert in 110 year history“If you look at Chilcot and the Iraq problems and what went wrong ... in large part this was about groupthink and groupthink is manifestly more likely to happen when you have the same sort of people seating around a table, so I also think in terms of quality of our decision making, it is absolutely key.”Andrew Parker, head of MI5, pointed out that his service and its staff must reflect British society as a whole, the values it represents and have a common aim to combat the threat of groups like Isis. And that is one of the main “reasons why you would want to have a erse workforce.”Jeremy Fleming, director of GCHQ, held that striving for ersity meant\u0026nbsp “changing the perception of a career in the intelligence community so that men and women from every part of society can imagine themselves thriving in the intelligence and security world.”The ISC report, Diversity and Inclusion in the UK Intelligence Community, examined four key protected characteristics under the 2010 Equality Act – gender, race, sexuality and disability. It pointed out that MI5 and MI6 have both appeared in lists of the top 50 employers for women and those two agencies as well as GCHQ and the Home Office are included in the top 100 employers category of the LGBT rights group, Stonewall.“However, as many of the people we have spoken to have acknowledged, there is much still to be done,” said the report. One of the problems with ethnic minority recruitment, said the ISC, is security vetting “which is bureaucratic, takes too long and is widely considered by many of those we met to be an inhibitor to ersity and nationality rules, and that the wider public often has inaccurate and outdated perceptions about the agencies in particular, and the type of staff they are now looking to recruit”.Caroline Flint, one of the Committee members, said:\u0026nbsp“More must be done by the agencies to collect data about ersity, it is difficult to carry through a policy unless you have the data to work.” The report said that MI6 in particular have done well by returning to the “ tap on the shoulder” approach to recruitment. Ms Flint wanted to stress “ This does not mean concentrating on places like gentlemen’s clubs, but going to schools and colleges. Many people at the agencies are working hard at this, so pupils and students can relate to them.”UK news in picturesPro-EU demonstrators wave flags outside the Houses of Parliament in Westminster.Theresa May arives to open the Farnborough AirshowNovak Djokovic lifts the trophy after winning the men\u0027s singles final match against Kevin Anderson at WimbledonFar-right protesters demanding the release of jailed EDL founder Tommy Robinson brought chaos to central London after blockading a bus being driven by a woman in a headscarf during the marchUS President Donald Trump and British Prime Minister Theresa during their meeting at Chequers in BuckinghamshireUS President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump arrive in the UKEngland manager Gareth Southgate and his players look dejected after they lost their World Cup semi final match against Croatia at Luzhniki Stadium in MoscowSerena Williams celebrates after winning against Camila Giorgi during their women\u0027s singles quarter-final match on the eighth day of Wimbledon.

The people at the top get it the young people coming in are ready for new ideas, but it may take the mid-ranking people a bit longer, all managers should, of course, be encouraged to be involved.”The report suggested mentoring as well as “reverse mentoring” as ways to promote ersity. “We believe that\u0026nbsp both would be useful. Reverse mentoring would be a good way for senior, older people to understand what people from under-represented groups feel,”\u0026nbspsaid Lord Janvrin.A Government spokesperson said: “As the report states, we have made significant progress in recent years, but there is clearly more to do. We remain committed to further improving this and will give full consideration to the conclusions and recommendations of the ISC’s report and respond formally in due course.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

That has yet to be finally determined.”Sarah Wollaston, the Conservative chairwoman of the health committee, urged her to be “transparent” with the public about what they needed to do to prepare for a no deal.Her committee had heard evidence that people with long-term health conditions would be uninsurable in those circumstances, she warned.The prime minister said the government would be issuing technical notices to people working in specific areas – while insisting a deal was still possible by October.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

They’ve hired almost a thousand customs officials just in case Britain crashes out.“We’re a trading nation we cannot afford our customs system to completely get stuck because from one day to the next we also have to check all the British exports of goods and services. We also hired veterinary officials because if you crash out, you also have that problem.”Dutch port officials told The Independent this year the Netherlands’\u0026nbspcustoms authorities were aiming to hire between 750 and 930 officials – suggesting the number actually hired is right at the upper end of that early estimate as talks look increasingly likely to fail.On Friday, ministers from the remaining 27 EU states are expected to be presented with a dossier drawn up by the European Commission laying out how to plan for a “no deal” Brexit.\u0026nbspWe cannot afford our customs system to completely get stuck because from one day to the next we also have to check all the British exportsThe Netherlands has been amongst the best prepared EU member states regarding Brexit, with ports like Rotterdam and hub airports like Schipol planning significant physical changes to accommodate the extra checks likely to slow down trade following Britain’s departure.Preparations in the UK are behind schedule for a “no deal” scenario, with huge overflow lorry parks needed to accommodate freight in Kent not expected to be completed in time if Britain does crash out.Mr Omtzigt was scathing at the UK’s lack of preparations for its Brexit talks and the timing of the white paper outlining the nation’s Brexit ambitions: “I share concerns that it’s a bit late in the day, that one year and four months after tabling the Article 50 notification, the UK makes a proposal.“I think it’s a proposal that’s a good starting point for negotiations – but it’s a proposal to start negotiations. It would have been helpful that that had been on the table the day the negotiations started.”Ms May\u0026nbsphas repeatedly said “no deal is better than a bad deal” and threatened to lead the UK off an economic cliff edge if she does not get her way in talks with the EU.Asked whether the UK was hiring more customs officers, cabinet office minister David Lidington\u0026nbspsaid: “I think that all governments, including the United Kingdom government, have to plan for all contingencies.”Brexit threatens life on the Irish border: in picturesJohn Murphy flies the European flag outside his home near the border village of Forkhill, Co ArmaghAn abandoned shop is seen in Mullan, Co Monaghan.

In pubs, in shop windows, on cars, on scaffolding, on hats and shirts and flying above 10 Downing Street.And nobody was sneering at our flag now. Just guessing, but I doubt if anyone will be sneering at that flag any time soon.Not even Labour’s Emily Thornberry.What a ride. What a month-long high. What an adventure for those of us who are old enough to remember 1966 and also for the children who will remember this as the first World Cup they watched.Fifty years from today, those kids will still remember how they felt when England won a penalty shootout against Colombia, and when Kieran Trippier bent it better than Beckham after five minutes against Croatia.And they will remember to their dying day exactly what it felt like when we knew that England was not going to the final.The tears are real but so is the pride. And the pride — even more than the disappointment — is the overwhelming emotion today.England played with big hearts, true grit and the fearlessness of youth.They come home not as legends to rival the boys of 1966 but with their heads held high. Their nation is proud of them.And yes, it is only a game. It is not a war. Nobody died.But at a time when our nation is more horribly divided than at any time in modern history, we were reminded what a great country this still is, and how much we have to be proud of, and how much there is to love.And it was not your imagination — England was united once again.“Our country has been through difficult times in terms of unity,” said England’s young manager in his thoughtful, softly spoken manner.“Sport — football in particular — has the power to help that.“We’re a team that, with our diversity and our youth, represents modern England.In England, we have spent a bit of time being a bit lost as to what our modern identity is. I think we represent that modern identity and hopefully people can connect with us.”Gareth Southgate is right about the healing power of sport. This World Cup brought us together in a way we’ve not experienced since the London 2012 Olympics.But 2012 was before the bitter wounds of Brexit.It is Gareth Southgate himself who is the main reason this country has rallied around this England team.Southgate with his courtesy, his decency and his Yoda-like intelligence.Southgate,  who talks about “owning the process” and “managing our energy” — it is quite difficult to imagine the former England manager, Big Sam Allardyce, being comfortable with that kind of 21st Century dialogue. Southgate with his dapper shirt, tie and waistcoat combo, as suave as a suburban James Bond.Southgate who carries himself as if he is the living embodiment of Rudyard Kipling’s most famous poem.“If you can meet with triumph and disaster and treat those imposters just the same . . . you will be a man, my son!”Even as England were celebrating their very first win in a World Cup penalty shootout, Southgate took time to comfort Mateus Uribe, one of the two Colombian players who had missed their penalty.This was more than an act of sportsmanship. It was an act of humanity.Because we all knew that Southgate has been there.The abiding memory of Gareth Southgate as a player — the one moment that everyone remembers — is in Euro 1996, with his shoulders sagging inside a grey England shirt and his spirit smashed after missing a penalty (we never recall the players who were too cowardly to step up and take a penalty — history gives them a pass).Stuart “Psycho” Pearce had known penalty redemption — missing in Italia 1990 but scoring in Euro 1996. Southgate’s redemption has been infinitely more convoluted.There was an image that went viral of the 25-year-old Gareth Southgate after just missing a penalty in 1996 being comforted by the 47-year-old Gareth Southgate who shook up the world in Russia in 2018.If this World Cup has gone some way to healing our divided nation, it has also gone a long way to healing the pain that Southgate has endured for half a lifetime.It is true what they say ­— success is not final, failure is not fatal.The manager was well served by this young team, who were light years away from the central casting image of the Premier League footballer — the pampered, wag-shagging, blingtastic, Bentley-crashing, multi-millionaire airhead.These England footballers — even the star striker, Harry Kane, who would cost a minimum £100million if Real Madrid came knocking — were clearly of and from the working class.They hail, every one of them, from modest beginnings. Most of the squad — 15 — paid their Premier League dues while out on loan in the lump-kicking lower leagues.“Barnsley, Leeds, Bolton, Blackburn,” said Southgate. “We’re lads who have come from those places.”This England team are not ordinary boys — they are elite professional athletes — but they have all been ordinary boys, and there was a humility about them, a work ethic and total lack of pretension that made you believe they will never forget their roots.And if they come from everywhere from the North East to Yorkshire to the Essex/East End borders, they also come from every kind of family.There were those who grew up in solid nuclear families with both mum and dad and siblings present, and those who were raised by single mums, and those who are from domestic chaos.Raheem Sterling’s father was murdered in Jamaica when he was two, and Dele Alli escaped the turmoil of his riven family life by moving in with his best friend’s family when he was 13.Their backstories are as diverse as our nation, but every one of them has grafted to get to the top.Sterling was berated for having an assault rifle tattooed on his leg but nobody ran harder or longer for the England cause than Raheem.When you watched his mesmeric, lung-busting runs, how could you not warm to him?How could you not forgive one dumb tatt?“Good lads,” said Southgate of his England squad, those boys from the Mersey and the Thames and the Tyne, from Bury and Leeds and Sheffield, and once again he said it all.They are good lads and we cheered them, and celebrated with them, and in the end, we shared their pain because it was our pain too, even in defeat against Belgium yesterday.They were a band of brothers and for one magical sun-drenched summer month, they lit up our nation.This World Cup was a roller-coaster ride that grabbed you by the scruff of your replica Three Lions shirt from the first match against Tunisia and refused to let go until the end of extra time against Croatia.They came SO CLOSE — Croatia led England for 11 minutes.That’s how agonisingly near we were to saying, “Bonjour, Monsieur,” in today’s World Cup final.It was gloriously entertaining, but it was also far more than just entertainment.It felt like Gareth Southgate and that young England team represented the very best of us.We learned — or we were reminded — that decency is not weakness, sportsmanship is not soft, and you need never feel one twinge of shame if you give your all.And we learned that we love our national game with a passion that can never be denied.I honestly thought we would win it.Typical England fan!I believed that this was the year we added the second World Cup winner’s gold star to the team shirt.When the England players were chucking around rubber chickens at a training session just before the Croatia semi-final, I thought it was a tension-busting masterstroke.It wasn’t to be.But this England team have been through the full range of human emotions — from joy to despair, hope to disappointment, and this country has been with them every step of the way.The struggle continues, the dream will never die.I reckon 50,000 England football fans will already be making plans to go to Qatar in 2022.This World Cup will be remembered for breaking our hearts and uniting our nation.And a grateful, emotionally exhausted country has just two words for those Three Lions.Thank you. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

One able to set its own laws and control its borders.The idea of taking diktats from European courts, having no border control, and being unable to strike free trade deals — while paying Brussels £39billion — is not the Brexit people voted for.Mrs May should look at our poll today to see the bloody nose the Tories could be dealt at the next General Election.Unless she starts being honest with the country, then she will cause further disillusionment among voters, potentially opening the door to Jeremy Corbyn…Ushering in Britain’s first Marxist PM should not be a legacy Mrs May wants. EXPECTATIONS were not high before the World Cup began — for once.With the pressure lifted off the players’ shoulders — combined with Gareth Southgate’s leadership — our boys played with passion and determination.Despite yesterday’s loss to Belgium, they were real ambassadors for England.Meanwhile, the FA are set to apply for the 2030 World Cup. Good. About time.The tournament will mark a century since the first one in Uruguay. So where better to host it than in England, where the beautiful game was born?We have the stadiums, the transport and the passion — attributes shamefully ignored in recent years by Fifa.It is time that football’s greatest show finally came home. THE British divers who risked their lives to save the trapped Thai boys are true heroes.Their extraordinary, selfless, mission was utterly courageous, especially after a colleague died during the operation.Such heroics should be recognised.

But this surely depends upon what the other possibilities are. This deserves the serious analysis that Mrs May and her team have apparently not given it.There are broadly two options. The first is to accept one of the off-the-shelf arrangements. The one that most closely accords with achieving a full Brexit, corresponding to what people voted for two years ago, is the recently agreed EU deal with Canada.This is not ideal for us, but it is pretty good. It might be possible to add some bells and whistles that extend the scope of the agreement, particularly with regard to services. This is what is known as “Canada plus”.With or without the plus, this would give us tariff and barrier-free trade between the EU and the UK while ending free movement of people, the payment of substantial sums to Brussels each year and the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice, while enabling us to sign FTAs with whoever we wanted to.Interestingly, the EU offered us the Canada deal earlier this year but this was turned down by the Prime Minister, supposedly because it wasn’t ambitious enough and because it would not provide a solution to the supposed “problems” concerning the Irish border.Since then, Mrs May’s ambitions have decayed to the delivery of abject surrender while not saying so.As to the Irish border, it has been clear for some time that these “problems” have been manufactured by the Remain-leaning establishment precisely as a way of blocking a full Brexit.There is no need for a hard border between the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland. It is perfectly possible for goods to move freely across the border, relying on pre-registration and subsequent random checks.There is already a soft border between the Irish republic and Northern Ireland with regard to currencies, duties and tax rates. This would continue.Of course, it is possible that the EU will not now agree to something like the Canada deal. And the clock is ticking.In that case, there is another perfectly viable option, namely “no deal”. After all, as Mrs May used to say, “No deal is better than a bad deal”.In fact, this “no deal” expression is potentially misleading. It doesn’t mean that we couldn’t or shouldn’t have a deal on anything with the EU, including landing rights for planes, participation in various joint bodies, etc.What it means is simply that we would leave the EU without an agreement on trade, and operate under World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules.The WTO option is widely misunderstood. It should hold no terrors for us. We currently do the bulk of our trade with non-EU countries under WTO rules. And if we left the EU without a deal we would not have to hand over the £39billion “divorce settlement”.Moreover, the WTO option leaves substantial areas of policy choice, including over what our tariffs are. We could decide to drop tariffs on particular goods but not others for instance, on cars, which currently incur tariffs at ten per cent, and/or on car components, where the rate is five per cent.Or we could decide, unilaterally, to drop all our tariffs to zero.We could start to negotiate FTAs immediately. Just because we fail to secure a trade deal with the EU before next March does not mean we can never secure such a deal.Indeed, we could put the EU “at the front of the queue” for trade deals. We would be able to conduct negotiations without the pressures emanating from the ticking clock imposed, arbitrarily and ridiculously, under the Lisbon Treaty.Of course, trading under WTO rules would still leave the much-dreaded “trade frictions” and possible delays at the border as we lose the supposedly huge advantages of Single Market membership. But these frictions have been massively overblown by the UK establishment. WTO rules oblige members (including the EU) to facilitate frictionless trade.John Mills, the Eurosceptic economist and Labour donor, has come up with estimates of border costs that are a fraction of the official ones.His view is especially worth noting because, unlike the civil servants behind the official view, he runs his own very successful business importing large amounts of consumer goods. I know whose estimates I believe.Some critics will say that this is all very well for finished goods, but not for the businesses that operate complex supply chains. To listen to them you would think that these only operate within the EU.In fact there are complex supply chains operating across the world. They seem to manage without common currencies, single markets and all the other paraphernalia so beloved by the EU.Meanwhile, umpteen countries around the world sell huge amounts into the EU without being members of the Single Market. How do they manage to overcome those pesky barriers, I wonder?Whatever difficulties may occur in the immediate aftermath of a full Brexit, this does not represent the final destination. Only when FTAs are in place with a broad swathe of countries, including the US, will we be able to see the full impact.The argument that we must accept the Chequers fudge just does not add up. Who do they think they are kidding — us or themselves? “There are none so blind as those who will not see.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Except they haven’t. Theresa May’s proposal to the EU isn’t the grim “reality” of Brexit. It is merely what happens when negotiated ineptly, by Remainers.They further argue we should choose between no-deal, Mrs May’s proposal or staying in. Why? The first vote determined we were leaving. The only reasonable choice would be deal or no deal.But we must not let it happen. Politics is in a dire enough state. The Tories are in meltdown trying to secure Brexit while fending off Corbyn’s Marxists and the nightmarish ruin they would unleash.Overturning the 2016 referendum result before it had even been carried out would collapse all faith in democracy itself.THERE’S no way of sugar-coating it — police just can’t be bothered investigating burglaries, along with much else.We’ve heard all the excuses: they’re hard to solve, we’re too short-staffed, “Tory cuts” and so on.But victim ­Izabela Siergiej gave them the criminal’s name, address and mugshot. And they still judged it too tricky.Last year in the West Midlands burglary was up 11 per cent. Guess why.On so-called “low-level” crime, some forces have shamefully just surrendered.WHY was France’s President Macron buddying up to Putin at the World Cup final?We don’t begrudge him his moment of glory, of course. His team deservedly won. But Putin’s regime is guilty of ­heinous crimes, from the Salisbury poisonings to the downing of a jumbo jet.Four months ago France expelled four Russian diplomats. Was it just a stunt?This wasn’t a summit for world peace, as Donald Trump’s was yesterday. It was a football jolly, sealing a month-long PR triumph for the Kremlin.Macron should have watched from Paris.TAKING back control of our borders won’t mean a thing if we fail to exercise it.It is worrying that immigration has gone up again thanks to a 13-year high in those arriving from outside the EU — which the Government CAN limit.For years the totals have been too great for our communities to cope with. Where are the new homes, hospitals or transport for the 280,000 net migrants in 2017?We’re all for immigration to benefit our economy.

It would have kept us shackled to Brussels’ rules for all time, with no say over any of them.All the ambition for our great country as a newly independent global trader would have been swept away. We would have all the possible short-term pain of leaving, with no long-term gain.Theresa May’s Chequers plan is a feeble Brexit, but at least it’s freedom of a sort. That cannot be said of a customs union.It was repugnant to watch Westminster’s Remainer elite line up to argue for tying us to the EU, and pretend the Leave verdict didn’t mean actually leaving.Many seemed to treat it like a game, oblivious to the terrible danger they would have unleashed had they won.For once, and however briefly, the Government has something to celebrate.OF all the attempts to thwart Brexit, the campaign to pretend the referendum wasn’t fair is the most pathetic and dishonest.The Electoral Commission’s probe into Vote Leave’s alleged overspending is fatally flawed if it failed even to interview those who ran it.Worse, it has not applied the same scrutiny to the Remain camp, which clearly co-ordinated smaller groups just as Vote Leave is said to have done.As for Remainers claiming this alleged overspend skewed a tight referendum, what cobblers. The Commission’s own figures show Remain vastly outspent Leave — on top of the £9million David Cameron wasted leafleting every home begging us to vote to stay in.The odds were massively stacked against Leave and they still won.This Remain rearguard action has nothing to do with the vote’s legitimacy.It is just a continuing tantrum, aimed at the 17.4million who disagreed with them.IMAGINE the outrage if a newspaper hosted online videos of kids being abused.Facebook does, and refuses to remove them. It just marks them “disturbing” and limits them to users claiming to be over 18. Virtually everyone, in other words.A moderator, sickeningly, tells an undercover reporter: “If you start censoring too much, people lose interest in the platform. It’s all about making money.”Since Facebook apparently now considers itself a publisher it must be treated as such.

Blow after blow rains down on her authority. She is battered and bruised by her own party yet refuses to realise her time is up.The past few days have brought yet more resignations. Following the Foreign Secretary and the Brexit Secretary are ministers whose names escape me let’s call them Cuthbert, Dibble and Grubb.Though hardly well known, these MPs have grandly flounced off in protest at May’s handling of Brexit.In a particularly odd development, one is leaving the Government because he thinks the Government is not sticking to the spirit of government policy.All this on top of last week’s embarrassment, courtesy of Donald Trump. The President might have softened his comments about the Prime Minister and the “turmoil” afflicting the UK but the damage to May’s authority was done.God knows how this looks to the rest of the world. We used to bestride the international stage like a colossus now we stumble across it like Frank Spencer.The Prime Minister can’t take all the blame. She has been dealt a difficult hand — her party and the country split on Brexit, Europe turning the thumbscrews and Ukip waiting in the wings to hoover up Tory votes. It would be hard for any politician to make an outright success of this.But where Theresa May HAS failed categorically is on communicating her plans to the British people.The Chequers deal should have been a big moment. She should have been all over the TV stations selling this deal hard.In the past, prime ministers held public broadcasts to explain important matters to the people. Anthony Eden gave one on the Suez crisis, Harold Wilson on the devaluation of the Pound. Ted Heath warned in 1973 that the nation faced “the hardest Christmas that we have known since the war”.These leaders looked the nation in the eye, spoke directly to the British people — and LED.Theresa May, on the other hand, seems reluctant to get out and make the case for her own policy.Little wonder that two thirds of the public questioned on the Chequers deal were baffled by it. Confusion reigns.This points to a major problem with May’s premiership. She is hopeless at telling a national story.It’s the job of a leader not just to make decisions but to inspire the nation. For the person in No10, their words speak as loudly as their actions. They need to tell a compelling story about where Britain is going.Margaret Thatcher told the story of Britain emerging from the ashes of socialism thanks to the hard work and enterprise of its people: “A get-up-and-go instead of a sit-back-and-wait-for- it Britain.”Tony Blair told the story of Britain shrugging off the past and embracing the modern world: “A new Britain . . . a model 21st-century nation, based not on privilege, class or background, but on the equal worth of all.”David Cameron told the story of Britain clearing up the economic mess left by Labour, paying down our debts and living within our means.Love or loathe these leaders, at least they told a clear story about where Britain was going. We get none of this from May.She makes a virtue of just “getting on with the job”. But in a nation divided on Brexit, we desperately need more. We need a clear sense of direction for Britain’s future.Of course, the Prime Minister cannot last for much longer. In boxing terms she’s in the 12th round. Before long there will be a leadership contest — and those hoping to succeed May must learn from where she went wrong.The next resident of No10 must not only have the right policies but the right vision.If Britain is to regain its reputation abroad, and its self-respect at home, we urgently need a Prime Minister who inspires, who tells a national story — and who truly leads.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They will also ensure children learn how to recognise when others are struggling with mental health and how to respond.The classes will help bolster “healthy friendships, family relationships and other relationships they are likely to encounter”.Mr Hinds said: “I want to make sure that our children are able to grow up to become happy and well-rounded individuals who know how to deal with the challenges of the modern world.“Part of this is making sure they are informed about how to keep themselves safe and healthy and have good relationships with others.He added: “Good physical and mental health is also at the heart of ensuring young people are ready for the adult world.By making health education compulsory we are giving young people the tools they need to be ready to thrive when they leave school.”Chris Snowdon, head of lifestyle economics at the Institute for Economic Affairs, said: “No one disagrees with ‘health education in principle, but the curriculum is becoming so packed with worthy causes that children will soon not have time to read and write.“Children are already bombarded by endless healthy eating messages at school.

Sadly, a year or so later they also voted to keep the appalling Anna Soubry as their local MP. Let’s hope they never make that mistake again.For the last year this bilious, jabbering woman has done everything she possibly can to thwart the will of her electors.She is a staunch Remainer and is seemingly prepared to bring down the Government to get her way. Her actions suggest she couldn’t give a monkey’s about what the people in her constituency think.Two nights ago she was one of 12 Conservative rebels who voted against the Government. She wanted Britain to remain part of a customs union with the EU. That would mean — effectively — no real Brexit. And if they had won, it would have been catastrophe for the Government. And in my opinion, the country.The reason they didn’t lose is solely down to a bunch of courageous Labour MPs, including the excellent Frank Field, who voted with the Government. Soubry isn’t alone, of course. The people of Loughborough, Leics, also voted by a large margin to leave the EU.But they are represented in the House of Commons by Nicky Morgan, who appears not to give a toss what they think. She also voted for a customs union. Nicky is famous among many for being the second worst Education Secretary this country has ever had. She’s pipped to the post for that particular prize by Justine Greening.Being useless in their Cabinet posts isn’t the only thing that unites these two women. Greening is also opposed to Brexit and she has even called for a second referendum. Because she didn’t like the result of the first one.The people of Beaconsfield, Bucks, voted to leave the EU. But their MP, the grim Dominic Grieve, who resembles a funeral director from about 1923, appears not to care less. He has said he’s prepared to “collapse” the Government if he does not get his way.Sarah Wollaston is another one. Another embittered MP. Her constituency, Totnes in Devon, voted to leave by a sizeable margin.Because while it is true that the majority of Labour MPs are also opposed to Brexit, they have been nothing like as dangerous as the Tory rebels.We are in a mess. The Prime Minister staggers from crisis to crisis, striking meaningless deals whenever she can to stave off defeat for a few more days.She surely cannot last much longer. A Remainer herself, of course, I think she should be persuaded to call it a day. Go home, put her feet up. And let her party elect a leader who will take no more c**p from Brussels.And no more c**p from the likes of Soubry and Greening, either.THE top scientist Richard Dawkins – Britain’s most famous atheist – has got himself into trouble.He has said that he prefers to hear the sound of cathedral bells to the muezzin wail calling Muslims to prayer.  Saying something as inoffensive as that is enough to get you into hot water these days.Dawkins has been called a bigot as a consequence. I have to say I disagree with him. I love the sound of cathedral bells, sure.But I also enjoying hearing the Muslim call to prayer – when I’ve been on my travels in Morocco or Malaysia. But, over here, it’s cathedral bells for me every time.Here’s a tip, then.Take them to an expensive shoe shop and make them look at the display through the window.And remember the noise they make.KATIE PRICE is on holiday in Thailand and of course she’s got her baps out.  This might be a problem for Katie, pictured with boyfriend Kris Boyson.Topless sunbathing is against the law over there. This is because tourists enjoy looking at the scenic islands. Without having their view obliterated by a pair of breasts the size of Koh Samui.So watch yourself, Katie. And as a break from lying on the beach, how do you fancy a spot of caving?YOU’VE got to love the toffs, haven’t you?  Most of them are absolutely crazy after years of inbreeding.Take the brilliant Lizzie Purbrick who described herself as “a very well-bred toff”.  She went round to her married lover’s home after he’d cheated on her with a third woman.No messing with Lizzie. She took with her eight litres of pig’s blood which she sprayed across his flat. She daubed the words “slut” and “whore” and “big d**k lord” on his walls and sprayed a giant penis on the floor.  She said: “So many people have said I should write my life story, but I’m so bonkers I can’t remember it.”The judge said – in one of the great under-statements of the decade – that she had “real concerns about the defendant’s ability to make rational decisions”.No s**t, Sherlock.It started out a few years back with just a couple of stalls. Now the entire town centre is closed off and thousands turn up to pig themselves on cuisine from scores of nationalities.I got so stuffed last year I needed to be helped home. And not a chicken parmo – the supposed Teesside dish of choice – in sight.IT’S not often that the Labour peer Dame Margaret Hodge says something worth repeating. But in telling her party leader Jeremy Corbyn that he was a “f***ing anti-Semite and a racist” I think she kinda hit the nail on the head.Meanwhile, the decent, moderate Labour MP John Woodcock has resigned the party whip and become an independent.Long-time party members – like I was, until last year – know that Labour is currently led by a hard-left anti-Jewish rabble of thickoes.I hope the voters twig this sooner or later.AND now it’s time for Hypocrites of the Week. A special award for Pimlico Plumbers of London.They’ve put up a giant banner outside their premises about Brexit, saying: “Nobody voted to be poorer!”Pimlico Plumbers has just lost a landmark case brought by one of its employees. He, like almost all of their staff, was kept on a contract which allowed the firm to pay him less than the proper rate.They were done under a UK Supreme Court decision, using laws designed to stop unscrupulous firms exploiting cheap labour.I wonder what it is about the EU that Pimlico Plumbers likes so much?

A spokesman said that given Mr Lewis only took part in two of nine votes – the closest two - “it seems hard to take the explanation at face value”.Lib Dem whip Alistair Carmichael said the problem was “symptomatic of a wider problem”.

A spokesman for the leader of the opposition described Margaret Hodge\u0027s behaviour as unacceptable and confirmed that formal disciplinary action would be taken. And he said she had broken the rules for Labour MPs and had brought the party into disrepute. The ex-minister, who is herself Jewish and lost family members in the Holocaust, confronted the Labour leader after the party\u0027s ruling NEC body approved a new anti-Semitism code which has been condemned by the Jewish community . She reportedly called the Labour leader a f***ing anti-Semite and a racist in an extraordinary exchange in the House of Commmons. The clash was seen by several MPs and took place behind the Speaker\u0027s chair seconds after MPs had voted on crunch Brexit legislation on Tuesday night. Mrs Hodge allegedly told Mr Corbyn: “You’re a f***ing anti-Semite and a racist. You have proved you don’t want people like me in the party”.   Labour MPs help Theresa May dodge no-confidence vote which could have triggered Tory-toppling general election  Mr Corbyn replied: “I’m sorry you feel like that.” Mrs Hodge confirmed the exchange to the Jewish Chronicle but denied swearing. A Labour party source said Mrs Hodge was aggressive while Mr Corbyn was calm. Writing for the , she said: “I chose to confront Jeremy directly and personally to express my anger and outrage. I stand by my action as well as my words. “My grandmother and my uncle were murdered by Hitler and many cousins were slaughtered in the gas chambers ... I joined the Labour party to fight racism. To find myself 50 years later, in 2018 confronting antisemitism in my own party is completely and utterly awful.” Jeremy Corbyn’s spokesman said: “The behaviour that you’re talking about is clearly unacceptable under Labour Party Parliamentary rules for behaviour between colleagues and action will be taken over it. “Of course all concerns of all MPs need to be discussed and addressed, and Jeremy is always open to discussing those with members of the Labour party.  He added: “The rules of the Parliamentary Labour Party specify that behaviour between colleagues must be respectful and not bring the party into disrepute.” Asked whether there would be an investigation, when action would be taken and for any detail on what action would be taken, the spokesman repeatedly said: “Action will be taken.” Labour\u0027s Wes Streeting was one of many who tweeted in defence of the Barking MP. He said: Margaret Hodge is a first class parliamentarian and MP. She beat back the BNP in Barking, she’s not about to be intimidated by off the record briefing - and she’s not alone. It comes amid an ongoing row within the party over Labour\u0027s new anti-Semitism code.

Despite all her pain, Prime Minister seemed to emerge unscathed tonight from a crunch address to warring backbenchers in Parliament. It couldn\u0027t have started more awkwardly. The purple-clad PM was made to wait for around five minutes outside the wood panelled Commons Committee Room 14. Asked about her prospects for survival she said: I think you know the answer to that.  And asked if she would be watching Boris Johnson\u0027s resignation speech on catch-up tonight, she coolly said she would be doing my red box instead.  But once inside she received the usual rapturous welcome - a drumbeat of desk-banging like a herd of sheep crossing a rickety bridge.  Of course, having an audience of dozens of waiting journalists outside the wood-panelled room made it more theatre than reality. But the dramatics weren\u0027t just saved for the brave faces outside the room. Inside, an MP publicly announced he had withdrawn his letter of no confidence in the Prime Minister - which he submitted just eight days earlier. MPs described Simon Clarke\u0027s moment as “electric” and a moment of “theatre”. Theresa May swept out of the meeting smiling but said nothing to waiting journalists. One Cabinet minister declared MPs had “come to their senses” and shown they could “hang together and support the Prime Minister”. Mr Clarke told journalists afterwards: We’ve looked into the abyss in the last few days.”   He said he was deeply opposed to her Chequers deal, but had withdrawn his letter because of “the threat from a Corbyn government or no Brexit at all.  He added: This was a personal decision. “We’ve all been through the mill in the last few weeks and I have to make the decisions.” Asked for Mrs May’s reaction Mr Clarke said: “It was classic Prime Minister. She doesnt buckle under pressure and she doesn’t revel in the good moments. “I imagine some relief”. The message - to journalists outside at least - was one of unity. One MP told the Mirror: She said we’re going on to take the fight to the opponents and we’re going to win.

Mairi Gordon, 45 and Rhys McLellan, 43, from Leith, Edinburgh, went out in their 20s but split in 1995. They jokingly agreed that if they were still both single at 40 they would marry – a promise that’s now come true. The couple had a chance meeting years later and fell in love all over again, reports the Daily Record . Make-up artist Mairi, said: “I never forget the day we split up when we were young.  We said to each other if we are still single at the age of 40 we would get married. I still can’t believe that we did it.” Mairi, who describes Rhys as the love of her life, said she randomly bumped into the electrician for the first time since they broke up in 2009. She said: “I went to a fashion show with a friend who had been organising it for St Columba’s Charity. “Rhys was a volunteer for the charity and we all went for a drink after the show. “There was definitely a spark between us but nothing was acted upon as we were both in committed relationships. I was living in Cornwall and he was in Leith, Edinburgh, at the time.”  Three years later, Mairi moved back to the capital after splitting up with her long-term boyfriend of 12 years. While apart, neither Mairi nor Rhys got married or had children. And while Rhys had a few relationships, he was single for most of their time apart. She said: “I bumped into his mum and sister in a shop in Leith, they gave me his number and I called him for a catch-up. “We met but I was still hurting from the previous break-up so again nothing happened and we parted ways. “The next year, I heard Rhys’s mother was in hospital with cancer – I called him to pass on my condolences and to find out how she was doing.  “We started to date for a few months after as we were getting close again. “But I was feeling scared about getting hurt and about us getting back together again, so I ended it even though I had feelings for him.” It wasn’t until 2015 when the childhood sweethearts finally decided to give it another go after Mairi had an accident. She said: “We bumped into each other again and this time both of us felt the sparks fly. “We were both single and the feeling for each other were still very much there. Soon after I had an accident at work and injured my knee. “He [Rhys] was always there to make me laugh, do some shopping, make me food. “That’s when I realised he was just what I had always wanted and never really stopped loving him.

Louise Young, 29, began suffering from severe skin problems while she was pregnant with her fourth child in 2015.  First blaming her ‘break outs’ on her hormones, Louise was shocked when her skin continued to worsen after her daughter, Angel, two, was born and she was diagnosed with severe cystic acne. Over the past three years Louise tried everything to help her skin from different antibiotics, face washes and even resorted in using her own breast milk as a ‘facemask’ after a midwife recommended it. But now, Louise is sharing her message of how a \u0026pound3 ‘miracle’ acne cream she bought on eBay, TCM Scar and Acne Mark Removal Gel Ointment, has transformed her skin in order to raise awareness to others in a similar situation.  Louise, from Stirling, Scotland, said: “My skin first broke out when I was pregnant with my fourth child but it just continued to get worse even after I’d given birth. “I thought that when my daughter was born it would go away, but it continued to get worse and ruined my self-confidence. “There was a point where I didn’t leave the house for eight weeks because I couldn’t bear to let anyone look at my skin, and nothing I did would help make it better. “I felt as though I had tried everything to sort my skin out – I even put my own breastmilk on my face as I was recommended to from my midwife, but that didn’t work. “As soon as I found this cream my life changed and within two weeks my scarring started to clear up.” After her daughter was born, Louise, a stay-at-home mum, hoped that her skin would return to normal, but it continued to worsen until June this year.

Dr Amita Sahare started her overnight shift as the on-call registrar in obstetrics and gynaecology at Basildon Hospital on December 21 2017 at 8pm. The handover left for her did not show the urgency of dealing with Reeta Saidha, 38, who was 15 weeks\u0027 pregnant with her third child, and who she did not see until 11.15pm, she told an inquest in Chelmsford, Essex. Senior Essex Coroner Caroline Beasley-Murray asked her if the handover had been thorough enough, saying: Are you saying that at 8pm you did not regard her as an urgent case?  Dr Sahare said she used the handover to prioritise her activity. It did not inform me about the urgency of seeing Mrs Saidha, she said. Dr Sahare recalled it had been a busy labour ward and could not see Mrs Saidha before 11.15pm when she was in bed and complaining of symptoms including abdominal pain, lower back ache and chest pain. Mrs Saidha, of Grays, went into hospital on December 19 2017.  She had been diagnosed with sepsis on December 21 at 1.15pm, the court heard. Dr Sahare said she was told of a lady who had suspected sepsis who needed to be reviewed and had a fever during the afternoon. Lawyers for Mrs Saidha\u0027s family say there were failings in her care, including poor staff communication in handing over Mrs Saidha\u0027s care and seeking input from senior staff, and failure to remove the source of the infection.

The fire started on the evening of June 24 and incredible pictures showed the scale of the flames as people were temporarily evacuated from their homes. Firefighters worked gruelling 12-hour shifts in order to contain the blaze which was spread across seven square miles of scorched moorland.  Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service Chief Fire Officer Dawn Docx said: The last three weeks has been one of the busiest periods that GMFRS has ever experienced and I am incredibly proud of all of our crews, officers and support staff that have worked incredibly hard fight to the fires and keep local communities safe. “The support we have received has been phenomenal and I cannot thank our partners, neighbouring fire and rescue services, the military, volunteers and local communities enough for their dedication and vital support they have provided in this incredibly busy period.

Leighanne Bromley, 29, was horrified when she heard a message from members of staff at the RNIB Three Spires Academy in Coventry discussing her 10-year-old son, Harley. They can be heard laughing amongst one another after one staff member says: And make sure he’s off all f***king week What about two weeks? Well don’t tell her that. The voicemail goes on to say: Oh yeah (staff name) did phone you, she just wanted to make sure that Harley is off all week, and the second question is could you keep him off next week as well.  Yes please, till the end of the year. Don’t bring him back until the 27th of July when ( inaudible) we are closed.  Loud laughter can then be heard in the background.  The retail worker and mum-of-one, from Cheylesmore, Coventry, called for the staff members to be sacked – and Three Spires has today confirmed one staff member has been suspended. A spokesman for RNIB said: “We can confirm that one member of staff has been suspended from duties whilst we complete our investigation.” Reacting to the announcement, Leighanne said: “This is what I wanted to happen in the first place. If the school had done what I\u0027d suggested than I wouldn\u0027t have felt like I had no option but to go public. Hopefully this will draw a line under the whole thing. RNIB has been very sympathetic and has totally agreed with me that the school hadn\u0027t done the proper thing in the first place. Leighanne phoned the school around 7.30am on July 10 after Harley had come home the day before [July 9] with a note saying he’d been ill. Shortly afterwards, she missed a call back from the school and received the message.   See below for the voicemail transcript in full    In the voicemail recording, a female member of staff can be heard asking when Harley would be returning to school. Appearing to think she had hung up the phone, she can then be heard saying ‘and make sure he’s off all f***king week’ while another voice asks ‘what about two weeks?’ The staff members can then be heard joking about the possibility of Harley, who was diagnosed with an autistic spectrum disorder in 2013, being kept off for two weeks or until the end of the year.  A final voice then makes reference to the upcoming summer holidays, retorting ‘don’t bring him back until the 27th of July when inaudible we are closed’.  Leighanne said she has never previously had problems with the school, which Harley has attended as a pupil for the last four and a half years. But she admitted recently she has felt staff were unsympathetic in dealing with Harley’s behavioural issues. Leighanne said: “I looked at my phone I saw I had a missed call from the school and they’d left the voicemail.  “It was then I heard the message. My initial reaction was just shock. My jaw just hit the floor, I was stunned. I couldn’t make it out at first, so I had to listen to it over and over again. “I was just in disbelief. “I’m quite anxious and worried about him attending the school, it just makes me uncomfortable. “He’s a really lovely boy. A lot of the issues he’s had at school I haven’t had at home. “He’s just a sweet, funny little boy with a sweet personality.” In a new statement issued today, Rob Jones, headteacher at RNIB Three Spires Academy, said: “We are sincerely sorry for the offence that has been caused by two staff members at RNIB Three Spires.

Vanessa Strike piled on the pounds when she moved 200 miles away from her home of Middlesbrough. The 28-year-old\u0027s weight reached 16 stone after scoffing on sweet treats all day at her job in a coffee shop. Vanessa would then return home at night and cook three course meals for herself and her husband in Worcester - including favourites like shepherd\u0027s pie and toad in the hole.  But when the super fit mum was diagnosed with breast cancer, she decided to do something about her weight and get healthy, reports Birmingham Live .  Vanessa, who now lives in Worcester, said: I’d always been really fit and healthy right up until my early 20s.  “I’d danced at the same dance school for over 17 years in Middlesbrough and had never worried about my weight, or what I was eating. “But when I got married, my husband got a job down in Worcester, and I totally lost my confidence. “Looking back, it was a really unhappy time for me. “I moved away from my friends and family, from the dance school I loved to a place where I knew no-one and food became my comfort. It became my friend. “It may sound sad, but food became the most exciting part of my day. “I’d eat broken breakfast pastries and cakes throughout the day at work, and drink coffees with syrup and hot chocolates with cream. “Then I’d come home and cook three-course dinners every night.  “We’d always have a starter followed by a huge pasta meal and favourites like toad in the hole and cottage pie. It was a serious health scare that changed Vanessa’s life. Her super-fit mum Sue was diagnosed with breast cancer. It was the wake-up call she needed to start looking after her own health. Four years ago, she decided finally to do something about her weight and lifestyle. “It was such a shock,” recalls Vanessa. “My mum’s the healthiest person in the world. “I said to myself: ‘Why are you taking your health for granted?’ “It made me take a hard long look in the mirror and realise what I was doing to myself, and make the most out of life.” Vanessa swapped breakfast cereals and pastries for high-protein porridge and lean chicken salads.  She started working out at home, until eventually she had enough confidence to join her local gym. “Walking in for the first time was one of the scariest moments of my life,” admits Vanessa. “I would wear a hoody to cover up and I would never take it off, no matter how hot and sweaty I got on the machines. ”Slowly, her confidence began to grow, and she began going to the gym four times a week Soon, she was talking to the other regulars, and one of them suggested that she should enter a body-building competition. “I used to stalk body-builders on social media, I was in awe of them and what they’d done to their bodies,” confesses Vanessa, who now works as a sales advisor. “I mentioned that I’d always wanted to do a competition to one of the guys at the gym – and he said I should do it. “I just laughed at first, but then I thought ‘I’m going to do it for that fat girl’”. Vanessa started training hard and also started ordering her weekly shop from Musclefood, a website that supplies high-protein and low-carb food for people interested in fitness and wellbeing. And all the determination and effort soon started to pay off. Now, she’s dropped from a size 20 to a slender size 8, and is now a healthy 11\u0026frac12 stone.

The Met Office says this summer is set to beat 1976 to be the hottest summer since records began 108 years ago in 1910.  It could also be one of the driest and sunniest summers ever. And a record 38.5C is possible in the two-week heatwave starting tomorrow night, as schools break up. Temperatures could reach up to 31C over the weekend, with the mid-30s possible from next week as hot conditions last up to two weeks. “Furnace” heat will make scorching highs risk toppling the all-time record 38.5C from next weekend, The Weather Outlook said.  The Weather Outlook forecaster Brian Gaze added: “Computer models show a furnace heat set-up next week with the UK between low pressure to the west and high pressure to the east. “Late July would could head into the mid-30s, with a slim chance of the all-time record 38.5C.” Met Office forecaster Alex Burkill said: “Over 33C ahead is not out of the question. Late July and early August are hot times of the year, and high pressure allows a lot of heating.” A Met Office forecaster added: “The South-East will be locally hot from Friday, and the South, East and North-East very warm from Sunday and Monday. “In the period to July 31, hot or very hot conditions will possibly develop in the South-East.”  Bookmakers Coral cut odds to 2/1 on temperatures beating Britain’s hottest temperature ever recorded, 38.5C on August 10, 2003, at at Brogdale, near Faversham, Kent. Coral’s Harry Aitkenhead said: “Temperatures will be well in the 30s and we think the record for the hottest ever UK day will tumble.”  Britain baked in 23 days in a row over 27C from June 24 to July 16, peaking at 33.0C on June 28 at Porthmadog, west Wales.      The Met Office said: “Temperatures this summer are remarkable.  If the rest of the summer is average, 2018 will certainly rank in the top 10 warmest summers on record - and if we continue to see above-average temperatures, it could well be record breaking. “June 1 to July 16 had an average daily maximum temperature across the country of 20.9C. The average daily maximum in the hottest summer on record, 1976, was 21C. “And if the rest of the summer was average, we would also be in the top five sunniest summers on record, and in the top 10 driest summers of all time.” "},{"url":null,"title":"tattoo addict genitals removed because","story":"NewsTattoo addict has GENITALS removed because they interfere with his \u0027aesthetic enjoyment\u0027Adam Curlykale, 32 started his tattoo obsession after being diagnosed with cancer - and now has whole body inked black\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByHana Carter20:55, 18 JUL 2018Updated21:14, 18 JUL 2018News (Image: CEN/@adam.curlykale)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA man who has had 90 per cent of his body covered in black ink decided to have his genitals removed after they \u0027interfered with the aesthetic enjoyment\u0027 of his blackened physique.

Adam, who even has his eyeballs tattooed, also has albinism and felt depressed by his pale skin. After getting getting to a whopping 90 per cent tattoo coverage, he felt that his penis ruined his look so he paid to undergo the extreme surgery. Adam shared pictures with his fans on social media after he had his penis, nipples and testicles removed. He became famous in 2017 after taking part in the TV show Second Face in Poland where he said he wanted the tattoos to cover the blemishes that were left behind by the cancer.  He eventually beat the cancer but while in recovery he had been left with a weakened immune system and was depressed by this and the fact that his skin looked sickly and pale. When doctors diagnosed him with albinism, he had started adding tattoos, and discovered a passion for the art once he saw the results.  He said: I always knew that I was different from the rest of society. My favourite colour for example has always have been grey, in different tones, and that\u0027s why my current skin colour is graphite.

But that image was dealt a blow today after Angela Merkel suffered an embarrassing and slightly awkward encounter with a pair of teddy bears. Clad in a smart, royal blue suit and with not a hair-out-place, the Chancellor sat down for a photo opportunity with a group of children at a kindergarten in Cologne this afternoon. But what should have been a chance for Merkel to show off her caring side turned into a toe-curling example of political incorrectness. Unknown to her someone had placed a paid of stuffed animals in a sexually explicit pose behind her. Merkel looks to be giving her best smile for the camera, interacting with the kids and their teacher during crafts time, seemingly completely unaware of the naughty-looking teddy bears behind her.  She was at the Caritas Association kindergarten today meeting kids and staff. The hilarious faux pas could come as another blow to Merkel who is increasingly under pressure to limit immigration in Germany. Last week President Donald Trump added to the pressure by issuing a stark warning to Merkel saying Germany better watch themselves as he blamed terror attacks to European immigration. He added: I have a great relationship with Angela Merkel, great relationship with Germany I think it\u0027s very much hurt Germany, it\u0027s very much hurt other parts of Europe.

Azzie Watson is accused of taking her daughter to a home as many as 10 times to let two men sexually assault her, police say. And the youngster was raped around five times, it has been reported. She contracted a sexually transmitted infection and had amphetamines in her system, according to medical records. Watson, 25, admitted she was involved in sexual activity with the men. Neither of whom are thought to be the girl\u0027s biological father, despite her calling them daddy. The toddler\u0027s mum, from Kansas, has now been charged with child abuse and endangerment after the horrific abuse was uncovered.  She has since described herself “a coward” for what happened, reports Kansas City Star.

As she tried to change the toddler\u0027s diaper she says the youngster cried: “Daddy hurt me. Daddy, stop being mean. Daddy, it hurts.” The foster parent then contacted police. Both the little girl and her one-year-old brother had scarred and mutilated feet embedded with sharp metal objects, thought to be from walking around without shoes in a littered house and garage. Meanwhile, a 43-year-old man, Charles Green, described as Watson’s boyfriend, has also been charged with two counts of endangering the welfare of a child. Court documents say Watson\u0027s boyfriend recorded her talking about repeatedly taking her daughter to a house where the child was raped about five times. Police were given the recording last month while responding to a rape report.

Bruce McArthur, 66, is accused of murdering at least eight gay men in Toronto, Canada - many of whom he may have picked up in the city\u0027s gay village or on dating apps. The alleged killer - who worked as a gardener and was also a Santa in the local shopping mall - was caught when police arrested him at home, where they found a potential ninth victim tied to the bed. A two week search of a property in the city\u0027s Leaside area, where dad-of-two McArthur was employed as a gardener, led police to human remains buried in potted plants - including small fragments of bone and teeth.  During the search, they found remains from seven different men, reports the New York Post. Police spokesperson Meaghan Gray said: I can confirm that remains were found almost every day we were there. McaArthur was a popular figure in the community and dressed as Santa to entertain children at Christmas. The city of Toronto has never seen anything like this. Forensics are now continuing to search other properties throughout Toronto where McArthur may have had access to via his job. McArthur, who advertised his services as a dominant gay man, was first brought to the attention of police in 2002, when he was arrested for an assault on a gay prostitute.  McArthur reportedly said after turning himself in to police He pleaded guilty to assault causing bodily harm and received a conditional sentence barring him from the Village and further contact with escorts. After the disappearance of Andrew Kinsman, 49, and Selim Esen, 44, in the summer of 2017, police began investigating McArthur as a suspect in early 2018, placing him on 24 hour police surveillance on January 17. Just one day after their surveillance started, McArthur was seen entering his high-storey apartment with another man. He was arrested before police began the search of the Leaside property, where remains were found on an almost daily basis. McArthur was charged with the murder of Skandaraj Navaratnam, 40, Andrew Kinsman, 49, Selim Esen, 44, and Abdulbasir Faizi, 44, Kirushna Kumar Kanagaratnam, 37, Dean Lisowick, 47, Soroush Mahmudi, 50, and Majeed Kayhan, 58.

That\u0026#8217s higher than Great Britain\u0026#8217s average of 46%.The test centre with the highest pass rate was Golspie, in the Scottish Highlands, where more than three quarters of learners were awarded their licences, while in The Pavilion, in Birmingham, less than a third were successful, making it the toughest.On December 4 last year the driving test was changed, with many observers saying the new test is tougher than the old one.Learners must now navigate for 20 minutes using a sat-nav, and explain how to test the brakes, clean the windscreen and demist your windows while driving. However the new test does not seem to have bothered rookie drivers. In April 2017, under the old test, the pass rate was 48.8%, less than the rate in March 2018, in the new test.The data also shows that 58% of people taking their test for the first time managed to pass, with 142 learners succeeding first time with no minor faults. Drivers taking the test can pass with up to 15 minor faults, such as not checking your mirror at the right time.DVSA deputy chief driving examiner, Gordon Witherspoon, said: \u0026#8220DVSA\u0026#8217s priority is to help everyone through a lifetime of safe driving.\u0026#8220All candidates are assessed to the same level and the result of their test is entirely dependent on their performance on the day.\u0026#8220We expect candidates and instructors to become more familiar with the new test and well continue to monitor the impact of the changes.\u0026#8221\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee boss mccann wants to see physical sofien moussa in between the posts","story":"\t\t\t\t\tNeil McCann has urged striker Sofien Moussa to get himself “between the posts” so he can add goals to his all-round play for Dundee.The Dark Blues front man failed to inspire confidence among the Dens Park support for much of last season.A late flurry of goals saw him finish with 12 in all competitions.And this campaign, he’s already started towards bettering that tally with two goals in the 4-0 win over Stirling Albion on Saturday.That’s despite a howler of a miss with the score at 0-0 before he changed his boots and 10 minutes later knocked in the openerNeil said: “I don’t know if the other boots were a wee bit tight or whatever but it was a super finish for his second one.“He knew I wasn’t happy with the first miss but his control of a great ball from Gense Kusunga was superb and it was a fine finish.

By 2017 this figure had dropped to 20.8%.Smoking rates across the country are down overall.Deborah Arnott, Action on Smoking and Health chief executive, said: \u0026#8220Smoking rates have fallen because over the last twenty years the British Government has gone further and faster in tackling smoking.\u0026#8220Britain has kept its tobacco taxes amongst the highest in the world, banned advertising promotion and sponsorship, put tobacco out of sight in shops and replaced the glitzy, brightly coloured packs with ugly dark packs with large picture warnings.\u0026#8220But smoking must become history for all of society not just for the wealthy.\u0026#8220Cuts in public health funding and lack of treatment for smoking on the NHS mean poorer more heavily addicted smokers, including those who are pregnant, are not getting the help they need to quit.\u0026#8221The data also suggests that more young adults are shunning cigarettes.The percentage of Dundee\u0026#8217s population who have never smoked has risen by 20% since 2011, because 18 to 24-year-olds are choosing not to.Last year, across Britain, 17.8% of people in this age bracket said they were smokers.In 2011 more than a quarter of young adults said they smoked.This is the biggest drop in smokers out of any age group.Ms Arnott put this down to banning tobacco advertising.\u0026#8220The brightly coloured pack displays we used to have in shops disappeared completely in 2015 and the packs they see nowadays are a sludgy green colour, with large picture warnings, rather than the brightly coloured, highly branded packs we used to have.\u0026#8220Is it any wonder young people today increasingly choose not to smoke. It\u0026#8217s much less cool than it used to be.\u0026#8221This has been helped by the rise of e-cigarettes.The ONS estimates there are 2.8 million vapers in Britain, and almost half said their reason for taking it up was to stop smoking.Commenting on the figures, Duncan Selbie, chief executive of Public Health England, said: \u0026#8220Smoking rates have dropped by almost a quarter in five years, a triumphant step in eliminating the nation\u0026#8217s biggest killer.\u0026#8220The data shows we are winning the war on tobacco and that we are tantalisingly close to creating the first-ever smoke-free generation in England.\u0026#8220But that war will only be won if we make more progress in helping people from deprived areas and people suffering from poor mental health, where we know smoking rates remain stubbornly high.\u0026#8221\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b45cc51a376d-846x564.jpg ","title":"dundee people asda ace jim checks out for the last time","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAsda Ace Jim Dodds has checked out of work for the last time.Jim was a war baby born in 1941 but 77 years later the former roofer is only just putting his feet up.The great-grandfather started his working life in Dundee’s jute mills before becoming a roofer.He even helped to build his future workplace at Asda Kirkton more than 40 years ago.Jim and his wife Patricia, of Whitfield, have four daughters and two sons.Their family also now includes 15 grandchildren and five great-grandchildren.One of Jim’s daughters, Debbie, even followed in his footsteps when she also became an Asda Ace and went on to work on the checkouts.Jim spent 15 years as an Asda Ace and for the last few years has been responsible for keeping the bakery and deli in tip-top condition.Samantha Will, community champion at Asda Kirkton, organised a special retirement lunch for the much-loved colleague.Jim was given a new set of wheels – in the shape of an inflatable walking frame.Debbie said: “My dad doesn’t actually want to give up work but it is time for him to go.“He was surprised by the retirement lunch – he didn’t think they were going to do anything for him.“My dad has never been unemployed.

We trained twice on Friday so there were heavy legs,” he said.“I think we have to play quicker football, especially in the front. We kept the ball too long in the midfield.“And I think it is more important for that, although some people will be disappointed with the result, we look at some of the decisions we made in the game.“We had 1-0 and the game in hand. Then we make a mistake and let them back in.”Csaba, though, remains confident a team he is still building will come together over the next few weeks.“I have to say this team needs a little bit of patience and time.

When he wasn’t used that much he makes a super stop at 1-0. We got a wee bit of a jolt and away we went.“I’m really pleased, clean sheet, four goals and the front three scoring – I’m delighted.“We were trying to work the ball through the middle of the park, the boys coming in for their competitive debuts looked good as well so, all in all, I’m pleased.”As well as Hamilton and Mendy, there also were debuts for Nathan Ralph and Elton Ngwatala from the start with the latter replaced by another new boy Karl Madianga.And Neil was happy to see them all make an impact, Mendy especially as he got off to a goalscoring start.“He’s direct and the most important thing for me is he has an end product,” the Dens gaffer added.“His finish was actually brilliant, he reversed it into the corner and you can see he’s got that eye for goal.“He’s really intelligent, he’s not a young boy we’ve brought in or somebody at the twilight of his career – he’s at a real good age.“Elton showed real good glimpses of his power and pace. He’s going to be great and he’s physically able to deal with the game here. Karl came on and showed glimpses as well.

What will happen is that one person turns up and uses it and then another and another.\"We have had one wee lad learn to ride his bike here as he was too frightened to learn anywhere else. We have had people playing Frisbee.\"A lot of people from the Highland Council offices have being coming here for lunch and Cheshire House have twice been here with a group of their people.\"Many have said they have been here for events but find it is a completely different place when it is a piece of grass.

He has also raised concerns at Westminster about such firms on several occasions.He said: \"People should not be charged inflated fees when they have paid for parking in good faith.\"The British Parking Association confirmed to me in person it is their view that people should not be charged if they have made an error inputting their registration.\"This guidance must be heeded by parking operators and, where it is not, there needs to be greater enforcement.\"He added: \"It is high time that operators like Smart Parking were removed from our city centres once and for all.\"The MP was responding to the case of Roger High, from Nottinghamshire, who failed to persuade Smart Parking to overturn a charge issued to him and will now have to cough up \u0026pound100.He said: \"In my appeal I explained that I had transposed two of the letters [in my registration number] and the fact that the registration number was so similar to my postcode that it was easy to make such a small slip.\"I was appalled and livid to receive an email rejecting my appeal, even though they acknowledged that I had purchased a car parking ticket, on the grounds that I had not purchased it for the correct registration number.\"Visiting the area frequently to see family, Mr High insisted Smart Parking\u0027s actions \"would not change\" his love of this part of the world.However, he revealed the experience had left him \"miserable and depressed as well as outraged\".Highland Council trading standards officer William Paul, who has been involved in long-running discussions with Smart Parking, said he was surprised to hear about Mr High\u0027s problems, believing there had been positive changes at the site.It is understood ticket machine key pads have been made bigger to reduce the chance of errors and new software aims to eliminate charges being issued when easily detectable genuine mistakes are made.\"We are encouraged by recent improvements in the operating procedures of the car park and to be fair to the company, these improvements do seem to be making a difference,\" he said.\"We are assured that these improvements are based on a firm commitment to resolve the previous reported issues, including incorrect vehicle registration mark (VRM) entries.\"He encouraged any drivers affected by charge notices to follow Smart Parking\u0027s appeals system and, if necessary, report the matter via the Citizens Advice Consumer Service on 03454 040506 or at www.citizensadvice.org.uk/scotland/consumerA spokesman for Smart Parking said: \"It is a contractual requirement for motorists to input their correct registration mark when parking at Strothers Lane Car park and failure to do so is a breach of the terms and conditions of parking there which can result in a Parking Charge Notice being issued.\"However Smart Parking acknowledges that motorists can make minor mistakes when entering their registration and as such working closely with Highland Trading Standards, has put in place measures to try to identify genuine mistakes against actual registration marks using the car park. Where the mistake is minor and the actual registration mark can be cross referenced Smart parking will endeavour to identify this and not issue the Parking Charge notice.\"Motorists are encouraged to double check their registration number before entering it and if those using the car park have entered a registration mark and subsequently received a Parking Charge Notice they are encouraged to engage with Smart Parking through our British Parking Association accredited appeals process.\"Thursday 19 Jul 2018 4:34

I still live in the area, I’m based in the area, being out of the game I still follow Burnley as well.“We bump into each other quite a lot because we’re part of the League Managers’ Association. He knows how close Burnley is to my heart and I’ve always encouraged what he’s doing – not that he needs my encouragement!“It’s nice that we can talk on a level about Burnley and it pleases me that he is really prospering.“Sean’s had his ups and downs in the early part of his managerial career and he comes to Burnley and has managed to find the right club at the right time for him.“Now he has good control of the football club which is unusual in the modern game.“The people at the club and him listen to each other and they work well together.“They’ve backed him and it’s paid dividends.”Phelan worked with Pittodrie gaffer McInnes at Stockport when the latter was on loan at the Hatters from Rangers in 1998.McInnes has revitalised the Dons during his time in the Granite City.In five seasons in charge they have finished second in the Scottish Premiership four times and third once.In 2014 he guided Aberdeen to the League Cup, the first silverware won by the club since 1995.Phelan has been impressed by the job McInnes has done and added: “I know Derek quite well because he played when I was an assistant manager at Stockport County.“He’s done exceptionally well and he wants to push on because he’s had interest from other clubs and knocked it back.“He feels he has stability there which is great to hear.“They are both pushing on and improving these clubs. Dyche is probably a step ahead but Derek is not far away from him.“It’s nice to know in football that there are still places where a manager can go, put something together and achieve something.“If people have some success at a club they tend to stay for longer than those that don’t.“I’m really pleased for Derek and what he’s done.“It’s about the culture you are trying to create and produce as well on top of results.“He’s had the opportunity to do that and other clubs have tried to take him so he obviously feels that he is comfortable and has an understanding with people and appreciates that.“That is quite nice to know when football can be a very hit or miss and a dismissive game for coaches and managers.“It’s easy to be a bad manager when you lose three games in a row.“Derek has stuck at it and people have stuck with him which is refreshing.”During his brief time working with McInnes Phelan says it was clear to see he had a good footballing brain.And he is pleased to see he has carried that into his managerial career – although he does admit at the time there were no clear signs McInnes would go on to a success in management.Phelan said: “It would be easy in hindsight to say yes, but when you’re a player you concentrate on playing.“He must have seen it as the next best thing to playing and then after that it’s about getting an opportunity.“He had a footballing brain and was a good player and obviously observed a lot of what was going on around him in coaching and management.“He has taken that on and fair play to him for doing that.”Phelan has joined Central Coast Mariners as a sporting director, his first job since leaving then Premier League outfit Hull City in January 2017.But to keep himself occupied during the interim period along with some business partners he has set up Sensible Soccer which offers a variety of coaching services.Phelan has enjoyed that work but his desire was always to get back into the game.He said: “I just wanted to get around people who wanted me to take a coaching session and it’s just developed quite organically.“Universities have started to ask me to do some days here and there with sports students and get out on the training ground.“In the main we’ve been offering coaching services and consultancy which is going down well.“It gave me something to do.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"aberdeen mums shock after man tries to lure boys into car1","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThe mum of an Aberdeen schoolboy who was targeted by a man while he played with a friend in a park has told of her shock and anger.Police have launched an investigation into the incident on Aberdeen’s Springhill Road – which is the third stranger danger incident in the city in the space of a week.Speaking to The Evening Express, the mum, who did not want to be named, said the man approached the pair next to Kingsford School on Saturday afternoon and “aggressively” told them to come into his car.She said the pair ran away and the man’s black Mercedes appeared to follow them before speeding off.She said: “Initially I was shocked and angry that someone had approached my son and his friend in this manner and went to the school to see if I could find this man to see what he was up to.

I haven’t seen him around, I haven’t met him yet. But I’d say, play as many practice rounds with terrific players as you can.“Guys you can probably learn from and see how they go about their business.“Just ask as many questions as possible, that’ll be a great opportunity to get some insight.“On the golf course, I’m sure he’s obviously a very good player, to be here.“Believe in yourself and, if there’s an opportunity to get on the leaderboard, it’ll be a great experience.“Go hoping for the Cinderella story. It’s possible, we’ve always seen an amateur do well at some points during the week.“Hopefully it can be Sam.”Locke, 19, who is mentored by and works for 1999 Open champion Paul Lawrie, made it into this week’s field through final qualifying, as he attempts to carve out a career for himself in golf.He might be two years older than Rose was when he won the silver medal for leading amateur at Birkdale, but he’s a year younger than 14-time major champion Tiger Woods when he won the medal in 1996.Woods made his major debut the year before at the 1995 Masters.Locke said: “I didn’t know that about Tiger, to be honest. But, again, you go into an event to play the best you can.“At the same time, it’s nice to know a player like that played his first major at the same age as me.“Hopefully if I just keep working hard, playing the best I can, and keep on improving, you never know where it could get you.”Locke will play tomorrow and Friday with American Brandt Snedeker and Australian Cameron Davis, and how he performs will decide whether or not he turns pro.He said: “It depends how I do. I’ve played in a couple of pro events before but nothing of this magnitude.“We’ll see. It’s obviously going to be a really enjoyable week, but it depends how I play – that’ll make my decision.”For the moment, the young north-east hope is just preparing as best he can for what many consider the toughest test in Links golf.Lawrie is at the Open as mentor, but also fulfilling sponsorship commitments and media work, sharing the expertise which saw him bring the Claret Jug back to Aberdeen.Locke said: “Obviously to have any major champion helping you is great.“It’s a bonus he’s won the Open at the course it’s being played. I don’t know how it played in 1999 compared to how it’s going to play this year.“It’s the same lay-out, but to have him helping will be great.”He added: “You prepare for any weather. With links golf more than inland golf, the weather can change quicker.“But you’ve got to prepare for whatever mother nature brings, so you just deal with it and go there ready.“If it stays nice, it’s better to play in but, at the end of the day, we’re all still playing on the same day.“I’m just trying to prepare as I would for another event.“Yes I’m excited, but I’m there to try to play the best I can. So I’m preparing in the normal way and we’ll see what we can do.“Obviously, the best players in the world are in the tournament.“If I play really well, I could be paired with other guys who are playing well at the same time (for the weekend).“Whether that’s any of the top-ranked players in the world, you don’t know, but all these guys are playing in a major championship and they’re all really, really good.“I’m not too bothered who I get.

Now scientists from the University of Aberdeen have added a third species to the mix \u0026#8211 the European pine marten. These native squirrel predators are recolonising Britain after years of persecution, and so the scientists set out to uncover the impact of this on red and grey squirrel populations.Three study sites in Scotland were in the Highlands (marten recolonisation for over 45 years, no grey squirrels), Central Scotland (marten recolonisation for 8-14 years, grey squirrels since 1945) and the Borders (early stages of marten recolonization, grey squirrels since 1980).Populations were monitored for five months using cameras and multi-species feeders \u0026#8211 the latter with glue strips on the underside of the lid to obtain visitor hair samples. This material provided DNA to determine visitor species and identify individual martens.The results showed that while red squirrels avoided feeders used by martens, greys were equally likely to use feeders whether frequented by martens or not. So grey squirrel numbers were reduced where exposure to pine martens was high, whereas numbers of red squirrels increased – unequivocal evidence that recovering marten numbers affect competition between red and grey squirrels.This finding is likely explained by the fact that reds, having co-evolved with martens, instinctively avoid areas used by martens but invasive greys, having no such instincts, showed no avoidance behaviour at all.Since pine martens’ range is increasing and extending southwards, scientists are optimistic that this will control the invasive grey squirrel species.As they say in the title to their report, in this case ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend’.PIC:The native grey squirrel may have an unlikely ally.

We simply don\u0026#8217t have enough children playing shinty in each school to make up separate clubs.Surely, in 2018, this shouldn\u0026#8217t be allowed to happen?It is only three clubs that are being affected by this, and they\u0026#8217re all in the south of Scotland,  half way through a season, leaving all our kids devastated at the though of losing their chosen sport.My son has been playing shinty since Primary One. He is now heading into Primary Four and is even more passionate about the sport. He enjoys quality team time, striving to be the best he can and just loving playing the game.It\u0026#8217s very difficult to explain something like this to an eight-year-old child, never mind the Primary One children we have in our club.One quote from a child was: \u0026#8216Everyone is going to be so sad if we don\u0026#8217t have shinty. Why would shinty people do this to us?\u0026#8217It\u0026#8217s a very sad day indeed for the children of Argyll and Bute who are simply being punished for what school they go to and where they live. We have to stand together and fight for our club and our children.The Camanachd Association needs to step up and find a solution to allow all children to compete nationally and stand as one united shinty community.Ailsa and Alastair Crawford, LochgilpheadSir,The Camanachd Association has put politics before the needs of the children and the development of the sport in Argyll.The kids are disappointed and the coaches who have worked tirelessly to set the club up are deflated. Surely the association knows this is a mistake that needs rectified immediately.Personally, Kilmory and Dunadd children\u0026#8217s club has inspired our son and daughter to get involved with the sport and to grow in confidence amongst other like-minded children.Stuart and Simone Charnock, LochgilpheadSir,My son has trained with Kilmory/Dunadd shinty club since he was in Primary One. The club has always treated the kids equally and welcomed all kids to participate.After years of hard work, the team was progressing well and was worthy of competing at national level.In his last year before high school, to be told he is no longer allowed to play is not only devastating to my son but greatly confusing and he is left wondering what he has done wrong.I fail to see how this can be classed as progress by the Camanachd Association. This needs to be readdressed to allow kids to compete in the game they love.Susan Jackson, LochgilpheadI was very angry to hear from local residents in Portnahaven that their recycling bins have been used by numerous motorhomes for disposing of general waste, including food waste.I have visited the recycling bins site in Portnahaven and spoken to my constituents in person about this and I can confirm that unfortunately Portnahaven\u0026#8217s recycling bins are full of general waste.This is as unacceptable as it is disrespectful. I have contacted the appropriate department with the council and asked for an investigation to be done. I also asked for some addition signage for the bins area.I made it very clear that my constituents should not lose their recycling facilities as a result of their bins being misused by someone else.I will continue to monitor this situation and provide an update as soon as I have more information.Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,It is fitting to mark this Diabetes Week (June 11-17) for Scotland’s 30,000 adults and children living with type one diabetes by noting that life-changing monitors are now available on the NHS.A child diagnosed with type one diabetes at five faces 50,000 finger prick blood glucose tests by the time they are 18.Each painful finger prick is part of a daily routine which also includes calculating carbohydrate intake and frequent insulin injections, all to prevent life-threatening hypoglycaemia and long term complications.But since November last year, a \u0026#8216flash glucose monitoring\u0026#8217 system called the Freestyle Libre can be prescribed by local GPs, offering an alternative to such intensive finger-pricking.The roll out of flash glucose monitoring, which gives a reading via a simple sensor, however, is not consistent across all local health boards. So, our message for Diabetes Week is to call for health boards in Scotland to speed up prescription policies and step up much needed prescriptions.As someone who has lived with type one diabetes for 21 years, new technology, such as the FreeStyle Libre, makes a world of difference.Type one diabetes cannot be prevented and until we find the cure for it, research and technology are vital.Holly Davies, development manager, Aberdeen\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 25","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 23/06/18, 5:52 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,Labour and the Lib Dems must recognise and respect the recent vote in the Scottish Parliament and the views of their Scottish colleagues who refused to give consent to the damaging Brexit legislation proposed at Westminster.Labour amendments to former clause 11 of the bill require consent of the Scottish Parliament unless a UK Minister ‘has reasonable grounds for believing that regulations are required for the purpose of giving effect to any international obligations’.It would be catastrophic for Scotland if Labour left the door open for the Tory Government to breach the devolution settlement.Leaving Holyrood exposed to powers taken without consent in any area connected to an international trade agreement would be disastrous. This could threaten future trade deals, environmental standards and food safety.The Tories think they can do whatever they want to Scotland and get away with it.The SNP tabled amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill to safeguard the Scottish Parliament from the threat of constraints on existing powers.This is something which Holyrood refused consent for last month by an overwhelming majority including all parties, except the Scottish Conservatives.It would simply be a democratic outrage and it would fly in the face of the fundamental principles of devolution. This Conservative government seems determined to destroy the founding principles of devolution and Labour and the Lib Dems must join us in defending it.Brendan O’Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.Sir,It seems that almost every day I\u0026#8217m contacted by farmers in my constituency with concerns about their future.This is hardly surprising as farmers are borrowing more and having to pay staff less, according to figures released by the Scottish Government.According to ‘Agricultural Facts and Figures’ published recently, agricultural borrowing has doubled in the last 10 years, capital investment has stayed the same and agricultural workers are earning £1,560 less on average compared to last year.The figures show farm borrowing has almost doubled from £1.38 billion to £2.28 billion between 2007 to 2017, while capital investment has stayed the same at £210 million.This demonstrates that farmers are investing much less in their machinery and equipment while still having to borrow ever-increasing sums to remain viable.This is on top of the fact farmers are still struggling with debts they incurred as a result the CAP payment fiasco caused by the SNP Government several years ago.Time and time again the separatists have shown complete disregard to the plight that our hard pressed farmers are facing. It seems our agricultural industry is just one more sector that is ignored by the separatists in their relentless push for a second independence referendum.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Claims by Theresa May that a so-called ‘Brexit dividend’ will help pay for a boost to NHS spending in England worth £20 billion a year within five years are highly disingenuous.The UK will continue to pay into the EU through the transition until the end of 2020 and will pay £20 billion of the \u0026#8216divorce bill\u0026#8217 through to 2028. In addition, the UK Government has committed to keep EU funding for agricultural subsidies, research and development and other key areas at the same level in the short-term.These are set figures so it will be at least 10 years before any so-called ‘Brexit dividend’, if it were ever to materialise, is to be realised. Add to that, if the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts are accurate, public finances are set to be £15 billion a year worse off by 2021, equivalent to £300 million a week.Interestingly, if taxes are set to rise, which they will clearly have to, it is staggering hypocrisy for the Tories to have attacked the Scottish Government’s boosting of the NHS in Scotland through progressive tax changes and then look to hike taxes themselves.Alex Orr, Edinburgh.Sir,Local government spending cuts have left councils in Scotland unable to meet the needs of local communities and, in some cases, are putting the public at risk.A survey of more than 2,000 local government employees working across all services reveals almost eight in 10 council workers have no confidence in the future of local services and half are thinking of leaving their jobs for less stressful work elsewhere.While local authorities have protected spending on statutory service areas such as adult and children’s social care, the amount they spend on other areas including parks and libraries has fallen sharply.Local authorities have had to cut so many vital services that they have now reached a point where vulnerable children and the elderly struggle to get the help that they need, entire communities are suffering and the public is being put at risk.There have been cuts to road and bridge maintenance, potholes in roads are left unfilled and bridges are at risk of crumbling. Crematoriums are not maintained, streetlights stay broken and parks are in disrepair as councils don’t have the equipment or the staff to adequately maintain them.There are now more than one million people with an unmet need for social care because councils do not have the resources to support them. Now is the time to reverse these cuts and invest in local government once more or the fabric of our society will come unstuck.Mark Ferguson, chairman, UNISON Scotland local government committee.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 24/06/18, 3:39 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.There is no denying Lochgilphead could benefit from a wash and brush up.

However, the away team were really up against it from the start. The Ardnamurchan ladies were clearly also up for the game and had a full squad to choose from. With some key players out and one new player making her debut, the nine player squad from Dunadd started strongly. They had several early chances but just couldn\u0026#8217t find the back of the net.There were some crunching tackles and tasty challenges in the first half the Ardnamurchan ladies were keen to neutralise the strength of Dunadd defender Iona McCulloch, often doubling up on her. Referee Beth MacDonald had her work cut out trying to contain tempers as tensions ran high both on and off the pitch.The first half ended 0-0 and Dunadd left the field feeling like they hadn\u0026#8217t performed to their usual high standards. After a rousing half time team talk, Dunadd were keen to get an early goal in the second half to help settle them and to perhaps go on and build from there.And that is exactly what they did. Straight from the throw up, Grace Drummond caught the ball cleanly, sending it sailing over the defence\u0026#8217s heads. Leone Airlie ran on to it and struck it smoothly, low beyond the keeper.However, the home team responded positively and had Dunadd pinned back in their own half for the next five minutes. On 40 minutes, a fortunate strike from wide left bounced past a few players and found it\u0026#8217s way into the corner of the Dunadd net, 1-1.Dunadd were not despondent and regrouped to press again. However, minutes later Ardnamurchan broke and finished well making it 2-1.Again the referee had to step in to break up some fierce challenges as Ardnamurchan continued to goad McCulloch. However, the young Dunadd defender answered the contentious tackles in the best possible way. In the 51st minute she collected a loose ball and broke away from her marker. After dodging past three players she shot high and scored a certain goal of the season contender, pinging it sweetly into the top corner.The remainder of the game saw both teams coming close to winners. Ellie Hetherington making some crucial blocks and tackles, clearing the ball to safety time and time again. Dunadd held on to grind out the result and retain their unbeaten record and hold on to top spot in south division two.After a summer break, Dunadd will travel to third placed GMA on Sunday August 5 in another crucial game as they search to get back to winning ways.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"scrum for burgers","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 30/06/18, 7:47 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe Mid Argyll Rugby Club had its annual end-of-season barbeque and awards ceremony at the Ropework park on Sunday June 24.The kids from P4/5 and P6/7 that played a big part in winning the league and runners up in P4/5 also received medals.Of the primary six and sevens, player of the year went to Murray MacDonald, most improved player of the year went to Aileen Barr, the coaches award went to Campbell Shaw and best newcomer went to Rhys Coffield.Of the younger kids of primary four and five, the player of the year award went to Arran Martin most improved player of the year went to Fergus Bennet the coaches award went to Jorja and Jemma MacDonald and best newcomer went to Logan Cinnamond.On top of their awards, all the kids were also given a new training top sponsored by Jewsons.The players also clubbed together to get all the coaches a gift each.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"inverarays sale of the summer gets underway","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 02/07/18, 6:37 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe famous Inveraray summer sale has started.On Monday June 25, Inveraray’s parish church hall opened its doors, brimming with exquisite odds and ends.Ornaments, sports equipment and anything else you can think of can be found at the church for a fair price.Volunteer Wilma Wood said: \u0026#8216Anyone looking for something in particular can give us a shout.

All four girls contributed valuable points, with Jemma excelling in the 75 metres sprint recording a time of 12.65 seconds. Jorja was the top Mid Argyll girl in the long jump reaching 3.03 metres and also had a respectable 10.55 metres throw with the 500g turbo javelin.The girls B team finished ahead of the A team in 28th overall, mainly due to an excellent 14.25 metres javelin throw by Sophie Balkeen.

The pair were steady, neat and quick all day and broke the timing beam on stage eight, Bishop\u0026#8217s Glen, to complete the rally in 23rd overall and third in class four.Everything finally came together and the car and crew got the result they deserve. The collective sigh of relief could be heard in body shops and garages all across the land, with annual leave in  most of them on hold until Douglas\u0026#8217s result came in.Duncan MacLean and Ian Parker were out in the mighty Peugeot 106 once more and were having a decent day, with a few hairy moments when the intercom wasn\u0026#8217t working (or so Duncan tells it) and unfortunately breaking a gearbox mount which, though fixed between stages, saw them over their time limit and out of the rally.Mull ace Ally Currie and his Oban co-driver Grant MacNiven continued to chase the bigger more powerful machinery in his 150bhp Fiesta and was sitting third in the 2WD section when a problem that they had been experiencing for most of the day became worse \u0026#8211 and the passenger side front wheel decided to part company on the approach to the start line of stage seven.The family duo of Cara and Donald MacNeill made a welcome return to the stages, in new machinery this time, debuting their Subaru Impreza and bringing it home in one piece in 31st overall and second in class nine.Mull\u0026#8217s James Campbell and Claire Tilley also got their Mitsubishi Evo to the finish and will be happy with the result.The event was won by Kilmarnock\u0026#8217s Andrew Gallagher with Jane Nicol on the notes in the CobbleShop Ford Focus WRC.The next rally action for Argyll is the Mach 1 Stages on the weekend of July 14/15 at Machrihanish.\u0026nbspPICS:Photographs by West Coast PhotosAlly Currie and Grant MacNiven blasted it while their Fiesta was still on four wheels. no_a27ArgyllRally01no_a27ArgyllRally02Overall Winners Andrew Gallagher and Jane Nicol in their Ford Focus. no_a27ArgyllRally03Donald MacNeill from Furnace and Cara MacNeill, Glasgow, make light work of the hairpin in their Subaru.  no_a27ArgyllRally04James Campbell and Claire Tilley from Mull in their Mitsubishi. no_a27ArgyllRally05Kicking up dust in their Peogeot 106 are Lochgilphead team Duncan MacLean and Ian Parker. no_a27ArgyllRally06\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"tv company seeks argyll adventurers","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 06/07/18, 11:20 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowCould you travel to The Far East without stepping on a plane?If so, a television production company is looking for you.Studio Lambert, the company behind Gogglebox, is seeking folk from Argyll to take part in a trans-global race for a cash prize.Flightless is described as an \u0026#8216ambitious real-world adventure series\u0026#8217.

I am still receiving many justifiable complaints about the terrible condition of Mansefield Road in Port Ellen and the hospital road in Bowmore. With long overdue road works going on across Islay and the rest of the Kintyre and Islands ward, it\u0026#8217s only fair these roads are not ignored.The poor condition of the Bruichladdich toilets continues to be raised by local residents.Since contacting the appropriate department I have been informed repairs and maintenance are planned for them.While checking on the progress of pothole repairs I had previously requested, I noticed some of the recent street light repairs leave a lot to be desired. While a quick fix is better than nothing, many of these short-term fixes need to be looked at again.I have been speaking to the BT Openreach staff across Islay who are expanding our island\u0026#8217s internet capabilities. I have contacted BT to make sure recent issues with phone lines in some local households are not a result of the broadband upgrades.There has been progress with local housing associations after pointing out many of their tenants are having trouble with mould in their housing. Measures are now being implemented to to rectify the problem. I was happy to hear Argyll Community Housing Association has fixed gate latches on four of its houses at Cnoc Na Faire in Port Ellen after I raised this with them a few weeks ago.I met with environment, development and infrastructure committee member councillor Gary Mulvaney about Kintyre and Islands\u0026#8217 crumbling infrastructure, alongside our growing industrial output with the success of distilleries on Islay and Jura.Later that day I spoke directly to my constituents in Tarbert after a number of locals \u0026#8211 some business owners \u0026#8211 contacted me about the recent flood of sewage on Harbour Street as a result of blocked drains. Scottish Water were coming under fire from locals because of its slow progress on the matter.I made my anger about the poor conditions in Tarbert very clear when I contacted Scottish Water. A long-term solution to needs to be put in place.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Scottish Water is asking customers to use water wisely in their daily activities to help maintain supplies during the current hot summer weather.Following a sustained dry period without any significant rainfall, customer use has increased significantly.In some areas, there has been a 30 per cent increase in demand for water and an additional 140 million litres are currently being produced and pushed through the system every day.The situation is being monitored closely to manage supplies across the country.This includes deploying additional resources to move water between distribution areas and tankering water to supplement local networks.Average reservoir levels are generally normal for this time of year but the current level of use and continuing dry weather means stocks of stored water available for use are reducing.Try to reduce use wherever possible.Businesses are also being asked to consider their use and how they can use water more efficiently.Simple, practical steps include: taking shorter showers, using a watering can rather than a hose to water plants, using a bucket rather than a hose to wash vehicles only washing windscreens/lights instead of the whole vehicle, turning off taps whenever possible and use washing machines and dishwashers fully loaded.More advice on using water wisely is online at www.scottishwater/savewaterscotland or call 0800 0778778.Peter Farrer, Chief Operating Officer, Scottish Water.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"riverside fun day sparkles in the sun","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 06/07/18, 9:44 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe sun shone on the Riverside in Lochgilphead for a day of fun.Mid Argyll Community Pool and Riverside Rascals nursery hosted the family day on Sunday July 1, featuring a variety of colourful craft and charity stalls.The unmistakeable aroma of barbecue wafted across the car park from Riverside Rascals nursery, which opened its doors to the public for the occasion, complete with children\u0026#8217s activities.MACPool lifeguards were on hand to keep an eye on the youngsters in the pedal boats while the sunshine glistened across the splashing fun.PICS:Four-year-old Kaiden Abel from Lochgilphead has fun splashing in the inflatable outdoor pool. 06_a27RiversideFun01Kyra Robertson, aged 11, from Cairnbaan, tries to hook a duck on the MS centre stand \u0026#8211 and it\u0026#8217s not as easy as it looks. 06_a27RiversideFun04On the MS Centre Mid Argyll stall were Maggie Dodd and centre manager Karen McCurry. 06_a27RiversideFun07Mary Stewart of the Loch Awe Pottery helps sisters Abby and Chloe McCallum, from Glasgow, to decorate their pottery. 06_a27RiversideFun08Cathleen MacDonald was there with her Woolly Bobbins textile-base crafts. 06_a27RiversideFun09Alongside Cathleen was her mum Margaret Davidson, who creates soft toys under the name Twisted Yarn.

On a lovely summer evening the rafters of Strachur Memorial Hall dirled to the sound of pipers showing off skills learned during the week in front of proud family members. John Kelly of Dunoon performed his master of ceremony duties with his usual wit and dexterity.An award, presented by his family in memory of the late Niall Campbell, is presented each year to the pupil who has shown the biggest improvement in the eyes of the tutors. From a shortlist of six young players, this year\u0026#8217s recipient of the Niall Campbell trophy was Mid Argyll\u0026#8217s own Camron MacPhail.Strachur and District Piping Association made another surprise award this year for services to the piping school. Association chairman Colin Stevenson made the presentation to Allan McLean of Kilmartin for his support over two decades. Not only has he driven mini buses to allow children from Mid Argyll to attend but he has offered a helping hand in many different aspects over the years.Winding up another successful week as the concert concluded, Mr Stevenson thanked parents, pupils and all the tutors for their support, while acknowledging the hard work of committee members and everyone who helps.PIC:Alastair McLean performs a Gaelic song to add a little variety. 06_a28PipingSchool01The success of Mid Argyll Pipe Band was celebrated as a group of band members performed on stage. 06_a28PipingSchool02The inimitable piping tutor Annie Grant, right, was assisted in her intermediate piping group by Alastair MacLean, left. 06_a28PipingSchool04Camron MacPhail was presented with his trophy by Jamie Campbell, a grandson of the late Pipe Major Niall Campbell. 06_a28PipingSchool06There was a surprise for Allan McLean when he was presented with a gift to recognise his contribution to the piping school over many years.

We thank road users for their patience in advance and encourage them to plan ahead by checking the Traffic Scotland website for real-time journey information.’Real-time journey planning information can be obtained by visiting www.trafficscotland.org or twitter @trafficscotland.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"kyles hammer home a win against caberfeidh","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 18/07/18, 2:24 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowMarine Harvest PremiershipKyles Athletic returned to Tighnabruaich for the first time this season and they marked the occasion with a 5-1 win over Caberfeidh.Kyles Athletic boss James Perlich was still without the injured Roddy MacDonald, while Andrew King completed a two-match suspension. His problems did not end there, though, as injury also ruled out Gordon Whyte, Thomas Whyte and Dunky Kerr although the latter was stripped as Kyles only substitute, while Robbie MacLeod was unavailable.Caberfeidh manager Jodi Gorski had Ally MacLennan back but he was also short of players, with Jamie Matheson and Colin MacLennan among his absentees and they lined-up with the Cabers with the second team.Kyles settled into the game with a goal on four minutes. There was a scramble in the goal area where Colin MacDonald fought for possession with Caberfeidh keeper Ewen Pilcher and defender Blair Morrison, and it was actually Luke Thornton who got the final touch to put the hosts ahead.Luke Thornton got Kyles and his second on eight minutes. Sandy MacKenzie played the ball across from the left wing forward position to Luke Thornton who smashed a shoulder-high volley past the Cabers keeper from 15 yards.Kevin Bartlett made it 2-1 on 13 minutes when he latched onto a loose ball in defence and carried the ball forward before thumping it past John Whyte from a central position.However Kyles restored their two-goal cushion on 42 minutes to make it 3-1 at the break. Former Skye Camanachd player Neil MacVicar, playing in attack, switched play from right wing forward to Sandy MacKenzie at left wing forward and he rifled the ball past keeper Pilcher from 18 yards.Grant Irvine got in on the act on 55 minutes. A ball forward from midfield was brought out of the air by Colin MacDonald, who slipped it out to the right wing forward position to the onrushing Grant Irvine, who swept the ball across the keeper into the right-hand side of the net.Sandy MacKenzie put gloss on the win with a rather fortuitous effort on 62 minutes. MacKenzie turned full back Blair Morrison and as keeper Pilcher came out to clear the ball, it rebounded off MacKenzie into the net.Donald Irvine was superb for Kyles, while Grant Irvine was an instrumental figure at full centre.Caberfeidh did not perform at the levels seen when they took shinty’s top flight by surprise in the earlier part of this season.\u0026nbspMarine Harvest South Division 1Title hopefuls the Kyles Athletic second team march on, beating Ballachulish 1-0 at the Jubilee Park.Balla’s Cain MacPhee was free of a one-match ban, while Kyles were without Luke Thornton who was on first team duty.The only goal of the game came on 19 minutes and it was a superb strike from Martin MacFadyen whose 25 yard piledriver from the middle of the park gave the keeper no chance.Balla’ had the chance to level on 35 minutes when referee Callum Duff awarded them a penalty, penalising a \u0026#8216kick\u0026#8217 inside the D.Lorne Brown took the penalty and he struck the ball well enough but his effort was superbly saved by Kyles keeper Douglas Nicolson. It was one of a number of great stops by the Kyles custodian.Kyles have a five point lead on second place Bute although they have played a game more.Bute 4 Bute scored three times in the final third of the game to defeat Aberdour 4-1 in their 12.30pm throw up at The Meadows.Bute’s Craig MacKay was unavailable as he served the second game of a two-match suspension.Aberdour travelled without Cameron McCue and David McDougal.James Craig gave Bute the lead after just five minutes and that proved to be the only goal of a tight first 45 minutes during which Bute goalie Kevin Queen saved well from David MacKenzie, tipping his effort over the bar.Referee Robert Baxter pointed to the penalty spot when Ruairidh Reid was wiped out inside the D, taking a stick across the knees, when he looked set to equalise. Angus Thorburn struck the penalty well but Kevin Queen made a brilliant save to keep his side in front.The visitors were awarded a second penalty shortly after when Roddy MacColl was felled inside the box. Angus Thorburn stepped up again but this time he did not catch the ball as he would have liked and his effort went past the post.The penalty misses were a blow for Aberdour and Bute took advantage and, with some good running and quick passing, they went on to score three more times.Robert Walker made it 2-0 on 65 minutes and Iain McDonald added a third with 15 minutes remaining.Chris Lawrence made it 4-0 on 80 minutes, although there was some consolation for Aberdour when Ruairidh Reid finished well a couple of minutes later. Angus Thorburn battled to get the ball to Reid and his powerful strike from just outside the D gave the keeper no chance.Bute were sharper on the day and they deserved the win but the final scoreline was a little harsh on Aberdour in what was only their second league defeat of the season.Bute now leap-frog Aberdour into second place in the league on goal difference and the Islanders have a game in hand.Kilmory 1 MacRae Park was in perfect condition to host the local derby between Kilmory and the Inveraray second team.A large crowd gathered to watch two teams filled with youth and experience.Kilmory started with top scorer Alister MacArthur in defence and they had young Andrew Innes up-front, supported by the more experienced Hal Jones.Inveraray went with a mature forward line which included Euan McMurdo, John MacKenzie and Neil Campbell but their back five were all aged under 18.But it was across the centre line where all the action happened in the first half.Referee Alex MacVicar had a busy afternoon and David Macpherson was first into the book for a cynical challenge on Sandy Leiper.It wasn’t long before Leiper joined him, yellow carded for a late swing on his fellow winger, young Ruaraidh Graham.Duncan MacBrayne was next to fall foul of the official for persistent fouling.In-between all the yellow cards, Alister MacArthur was dictating the play from the Kilmory defence, with young Hamish MacLennan doing the same for Inveraray and the first half ended scoreless.Inveraray came out the traps the quickest in the second half. A long range effort from David Macpherson was easily saved by the Kilmory keeper, but Neil Campbell was quickest to react and slot the rebound home to open the scoring on 48 minutes.Inveraray added a quick second following a well-worked set-piece routine on 56 minutes. Euan McMurdo’s free-hit found Campbell Watt, whose movement caused the Kilmory defence problems all afternoon, and he made 2-0 with fine finish.The goal sparked life into Kilmory who pulled one back on 65 minutes when Hal Jones blasted home an unstoppable shot from the edge of the penalty area to make it 2-1 and it was game on.After getting themselves back in the game, Kilmory’s discipline let them down soon after, with both Duncan MacBrayne and Sandy Leiper receiving their marching orders from referee MacVicar within minutes of one another.Inveraray capitalised on their two-man advantage and former Kilmory player David MacAllister scored his first goal for his new club on 69 minutes to make it 3-1.Euan McMurdo finished the day’s scoring off with a well-constructed goal to make it 4-1 with 15 minutes remaining.Inveraray will be happy with their league first win of the season, while Kilmory will be disappointed with the result and the fact that they will be missing two influential players over the weeks to come.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"shetland comes to cairndow","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 18/07/18, 3:08 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowFilm crews were once again spotted in Argyll with the cast of famed BBC series Shetland hot on their heels.After the excitement of Love me to Death filming in Inveraray and Lochgilphead last month, Silverprint Pictures’ made its way to Cairndow to film Shetland\u0026#8217s fifth series this week.The series, which has previously aired on BBC 1, is a dramatisation of the murder mystery novels by Ann Cleeves.Shooting took place on Ardkinglas Estate, inside and outside Ardkinglas House.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"strone point roadworks are completed","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 18/07/18, 6:51 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowA £1.6m project to improve road safety on the A83 at Strone Point at Inveraray has been completed.Around 370m of carriageway has been realigned and a section of the hillside scaled back, widening the road and improving driver visibility.Drainage systems have been upgraded to improve resilience in wet conditions, and new safety barriers and bike guards have also been installed.Cabinet Secretary for Transport, Infrastructure and Connectivity Michael Matheson said: ‘The section of the A83 at Strone Point on Loch Fyne is single carriageway with a history of fatal and serious accidents. This project has made it safer by opening up the width of the road and improving driver visibility around the tight bend.‘The work has also allowed us to install new safety barriers and improve drainage, signage and road markings at the same time.‘Over 6,000 tonnes of material has been removed from the nearby slope and specialist mesh and matting installed. This will improve the slope’s stability and help to prevent debris falling onto the carriageway.‘The A83 is the gateway to Argyll and Bute and we recognise its strategic importance.

The Black Bull on River Street was first opened in 1754 and has survived many turmoils in its time, including a blaze that broke out in 2014. But last Thursday, workers were told mid-shift to collect their belongings and leave, with the tenant having been given no warning of the foreclosure. Now, employees have joined a hospitality union to fight for what they are owed – and their boss has stated “they will get paid”. Day-shift manager, 23-year-old Charlotte Forsyth, was mid-shift when the pub’s owners, Rosemount Taverns, marched in and said they were shutting up shop. Charlotte told the Post: “I was in for about two hours and the head from Rosemount Taverns turned up and said: ‘I need the keys – I’m changing the locks, my joiner’s on his way.’  “I was crying and everything. “I’ve only be there for just over a month and I’ve not been paid a penny. “I still have bills to pay like everybody else. “I would not have left a stable job had I thought that in a month I’d be talking about signing on – it’s not on. Tenant Scott Burnell, of Glasgow, claimed he knew nothing about the decision to close and confirmed staff will receive outstanding wages. Mr Burnell said: “It wasn’t my decision at all – the pub company wanted to (close). “It came as a shock to me – I didn’t know anything about it until after it had actually happened.  “The wages haven’t come through yet – it’s a four-week cycle. “They were paid two weeks ago and they’ll be due to get paid in two weeks’ time – and they will be paid. “I’ll be 100 per cent honest – I’m going to have to find that money from somewhere else.” Furious workers took to social media to vent their anger after receiving information that claimed Mr Burnell had previously outed other workers of a job and money. Mr Burnell denied the claims and said: “I know what they’re saying on Facebook and that is not the case at all. “I don’t set out to rip anybody off – I had no idea that pub was closing yesterday. “Pubs do run into trouble – it happens – I’m not going to run away from this.”  Distraught barmaid and mum-of-two Dianne McConnachie said: “I’ve got children to feed and a roof to put over my head. “I live in a private let with a private landlord so I can be punted out any time. “Myself and colleague Jade are single parents – we’re the only people bringing money into our houses. “So what do we do? Do we go and sign on?” Boss Mr Burnell added: “The pub was closed down because it was losing so much money. “It was a disaster in terms of the administration and financial control of the pub from the management. “I think the level of incompetence and mismanagement was horrific.  “And then we discovered they’d been buying stuff on credit. There’s nothing wrong with that, that wasn’t their fault but I found another \u0026pound4000 in credit that hadn’t been paid for – it was absolutely out of control. “I was told on Friday morning the debt to the brewery was \u0026pound720 and by Tuesday afternoon, it had risen to \u0026pound4000. “It didn’t make any sense. “I’ve got a list of about \u0026pound500/ \u0026pound600 of advances paid out so they were not telling you that. “I know it looks bad for me and I’m prepared to accept that, but it’s not as black and white.”  Bryan Simpson, Unite Hospitality Organiser said: “This is not the first time that Scott Burnell has tried to cut and run with his workers’ hard-earned wages, but it will certainly be the last. “As the Director of Wire Inns, Idlewild and The Raven Hotel, he already owes thousands of pounds to former workers in unpaid wages. “Unite will continue to support our members at the Black Bull to get what they’re entitled to. “We have received assurances from the leaseholders of the pub – Rosemount Taverns – that as soon as they find new tenants for the pub they will endeavour to keep the staff in their jobs.” Rosemount Taverns were unavailable for comment as we reached our deadline.

The Honest Men were relegated at the first time of asking in the second tier in the 2016/17 season when they finished bottom with 33 points. But former Ayr hitman and manager, Roberts, reckons being part-time was what held them back. Marko, who played second tier football with Ayr under Brian Reid, said: “I think Ayr will be fine, I really do. “Being full-time in that league is a massive thing. “The last few times Ayr have been in that league it has been very difficult to compete with the full-time teams. “But the fact they have got that now will make a big difference and I don’t think they will have any issues staying in the league. “When I was there under Brian Reid, being part-time was what held us back. “You didn’t have enough time to go and work on things on a daily basis but Ayr will have that now.  “You can beat any team in a one-off game but over the course of a season of 36 games it’s difficult to compete. “But the fans should be excited this time as there should be no problem – Ayr can even start looking up rather than looking down.” Roberts, who hit the net 43 times for Ayr, was more than impressed with Ayr’s impressive goal-scoring form last season as they topped League One, pipping Raith on the final game of the season. He said: “I thought they were really good to watch. “You always thought they were going to score every game they played. “And I don’t mean just scoring one, you always thought they’d grab three or four. “Sometimes they were left open all over the park – but they had too much quality up front and that’s the reason they went up. “Fair play to them as they had three really good strikers in Shankland, Moore and Moffat.” Roberts added: “The way the league was won was certainly a bit of a way to win it.  “I’ve been in teams that have won titles and been promoted with five or six games to go, which gives you a great feeling of accomplishment, but there’s nothing more exciting than winning the title in the last 10 minutes of the season. “Both teams had the chance to run away with it but kept faltering.” Roberts managed Ayr for three years before getting sacked, He then had a player/coach role at Clyde for a season. He has now gone back to playing at Junior Cup finalists Hurlford United. But he insists that his managing days aren’t over.  He said: “I won’t give up on it, I just wanted to play again for now. The best days of your life are when you’re kicking a ball and I am still fit enough.  “Any manager who tells you they prefer coaching is talking rubbish. When you’re out there playing it’s  just great.  “I do want to get back to managing eventually though, but it’s all about finding the right club and what suits my life at the minute.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12935909.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_emp_ayp_080618maragret_12JPG.jpg","title":"meet this weeks class act","story":"NewsMeet this week\u0027s Class ActAyr United striker Michael Moffat popped along to Queen Margaret Academy to visit the youngsters who were holding a Soccer Aid event.\u0026nbspShareByAbi Smillie15:12, 17 JUL 2018NewsMichael Moffat of Ayr United pictured with the senior sports leaders (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailFooty fans and soccer stars joined together for a special charity event last month.

Scarlett is a member of the Glasgow-based UK Theatre School which works with a string of casting directors to showcase its students’ talents. She was one of those selected to appear before the casting directors working on the new Legoland theme park TV and cinema advertisement. Having landed a part, she was cast as an excited youngster exploring the park in the advert. Scarlett, who is a pupil at Troon Primary, had to travel to London for a full day filming session. The theme of the new Legoland campaign focuses on their ‘Deep Sea Adventure’ and Scarlett is seen on board a submarine exploring the ocean and seeing Lego sea creatures swimming around. Scarlett said: “It was a really exciting experience to be involved with the production and I had such a great time. It’s amazing now to see the ad now that it’s finished.” Her proud mum Tracey said: “We were grateful to the UKTS scheme who worked with Scarlett. She absolutely loved the whole experience.” UKTS principal Lizanne Lambie Thomson said: “All our students have the chance to sign up to our own exclusive in-house castings agency. Our team works with casting directors and producers from the world of TV, radio, cinema and advertising and regularly approach us for casting candidates. “We’ve had students in big campaigns for big brands such as RBS, Legoland, Skoda and Aldi, to name but a few. The involvement gives our students an amazing insight into the behind the scenes production of ads as well as TV programmes, radio shows and movies. We’ve had our students appear alongside real Hollywood big stars such as Rihanna, Nicole Kidman, and Colin Firth as well as music artistes including Kylie Minogue, Rod Stewart and Michael Buble. This amazing Legoland project was a lot of fun to be involved with and even more fun for Scarlett as she’s now starring in it! We’re all very proud of her achievement in securing the part.” The UK Theatre School is based in Glasgow’s West Regent Street and has around 700 students.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnTroonAyr NewsGlasgow"},{"url":null,"title":"vandal hunt after cars vandalised","story":"NewsVandal hunt after cars are vandalisedNeighbours are furious about old cars the owner refuses to move\u0026nbspShareByStephen Houston12:29, 18 JUL 2018Updated12:33, 18 JUL 2018NewsFour motors are always parked at Raithhill (Image: AYRSHIRE POST)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailIT’S a highly curious tale that’s causing unrest in an Alloway neighbourhood. A line of four cars all belonging to the same man have hardly turned a wheel for more than a DECADE. The road beneath them is a weed and dirt splattered state, tarnishing the pleasant surroundings of the horseshoe-shaped Raithhill. Every year the forlorn fleet is removed with the help of the AA to ensure they get their MOT and are road legal. And when they are away, a reserve takes their place in case someone else grabs the spot. Last week the story emerged as the cars’ owner Derek Cumming - who runs a chartered accountancy business in Ayr - told police his cars had been vandalised. Police then issued a statement saying the damage had been of “significant financial impact on the owners of these vehicles.” Ayr CID said they are “speaking to the community and reviewing CCTV” and added damage happened between May 1 and June 26. But far from sympathy from residents who insisted the cars were a menace and claimed Mr Cumming couldn’t care less about the annoyance they caused. Neighbours claimed Mr Cumming does not stay in the villa, which was owned by his late mother, and that he lives in nearby Glenalla Crescent. Meanwhile, the cars remain at Raithhill. Usual residents are an 18-year-old silver AUDI TT convertible, two Mercedes SL500’s aged 10 and 11 and usually a Range Rover rather than the 16-year-old Toyota Avensis. On closer inspection there is no significant vandalism to the four cars currently there other than a few minor scrapes and scratches. The Audi and the red Mercedes have small scrapes to the pavement side which look like it has been “keyed.” The Mercedes also has a small panel missing next to the rear window. Residents queued-up to tell the Ayrshire Post of their displeasure. One lady said: “You won’t get any sympathy for him here. Nobody can understand what he is playing at and he doesn’t care he causes us upset.” Another lady added: “In the winter when there is ice it is actually dangerous as we don’t want to hit his cars. “There is grass growing through the tarmac as the council road sweeper cannot get to it. “The so-called vandalism looks nothing to me . . . in fact if that is all there has been in 10 years then he should count himself lucky. “It was his mother’s house and his aunt also used to live there.” And a gent added: “It obviously costs money to keep them road legal and the cars are usually taken away at night so they can get a new MOT. “The batteries are down so the AA has to re-start them. “Three of the cars have private plates and he is doing nothing wrong, but the mind boggles as to why. “Sadly there doesn’t seem to be anything we can do about it but it seems they are there to spite someone and is so infantile. “He once put flower pots down his driveway because he thought neighbours were parking there.” Sixty-three-year-old Mr Cumming runs an accountancy firm in Cathcart Street. This week he was unrepentant he was causing the neighbours stress. Asked why the cars had been there for up to 13 years, he replied: “Because that is my home.” When it was put to him that he actually lived in Glenalla Crescent, he said: “That’s my home. Nothing is bizarre. I do live in the house. “Don’t report anything outwith the police report. “I can park cars legally and that is the end of the matter. I have no further comment.

Galashiels has been especially hard hit, with its proportion of vacant retail units now standing at 15% representing a total of 37 empty stores.\nHawick and Selkirk lag not far behind, with 14% apiece of their shops lying empty, and 13% of Jedburgh\u0026rsquos shops are also going spare.\nPeebles, Kelso, Duns, Melrose and Eyemouth have all kept their proportion of empty shops in their town centres at 8% or below, though.\nThe purpose of the town centre core activity area pilot study is to suggest updating the council\u0026rsquos planning policy in a bid to save the region\u0026rsquos high streets.\nIn it, lead planning officer Charles Johnston says: \u0026ldquoRetailing patterns continue to fluctuate, and the role of town centres is changing\u0026nbsp for example, the increase of online shopping and competition from larger national retailers.\n\u0026ldquoThe impacts of the current challenging economic climate are being felt across the country, and these trends are not unique to the Scottish Borders.\n\u0026ldquoPlanning policy must adapt to these changing circumstances.\n\u0026ldquoIn recent years, the council has amended its town centre policy in its local development plan to adapt to such changes, and whilst these changes have helped, it is acknowledged that a further review of relevant planning policy could be tested via this pilot study.\n\u0026ldquoThere are specific immediate concerns regarding Hawick and Galashiels, where reduced footfall and vacancy rates have had a detrimental impact on how these town centres have performed.\n\u0026ldquoThis is of particular concern as Hawick and Galashiels are the two largest towns within the Borders and have a strategic economic and social significance for the region.\nThe report recommends the council tries out pilot schemes in Hawick and Galashiels, either scrapping or altering their core activity area status marking out the boundaries of their commercial centres to allow a greater range of activity to take place within them.\nPlanning permission is usually only granted in such town centres if proposals are for business use in keeping with the surroundings of the sites in question, but\u0026nbspabolishing core activity area status would allow non-commercial enterprises to occupy empty high street properties.\nIn Hawick, the report says, a radical approach is needed, so it recommends councillors to vote to abolish the core activity centre there altogether.\n\u0026ldquoReducing the core area completely would, in essence, allow a greater number of other uses within the town centre, it says.\n\u0026ldquoWhilst there is the threat that complete removal of the core activity area may cause longer-term footfall issues, it is considered that some significant action is required in Hawick.\n\u0026ldquoTo implement this as a test case via a pilot scheme would seem an appropriate course of action in the circumstances.\nIn Galashiels, it is recommended that core activity area is retained but that the scope of activity allowed be expanded to include professional service businesses, non-profitable institutions and leisure activities.\nThe outcomes of those proposed pilot schemes in Hawick and Galashiels would then be used to draw up similar proposals for other towns.\nFootfall figures % change from 2007 to 2017:\nHawick

Your Safety. Your Choice.\u0026#8217The Royal Highland Education Trust (RHET) addressed the importance of getting children on farms to find out where their food comes from and that, with the right planning and precautions, they can be safe, fun and educational places.Carole Brunton, farmer and RHET Fife CI project coordinator, is in charge of organising farm visits throughout Fife, making sure that the farms, teachers and children are all ready for a fun, safe and educational experience.Her top tip for having children on farms is: \u0026#8216Common sense and plenty of planning.\u0026#8217Carole said: \u0026#8216For us, farm safety is extremely important. For the children’s safety, for the farmer’s reputation, and for RHET because if we had one accident on one farm it would stop all farm visits. We don’t want that to happen, so we have a strict regime.\u0026#8216We have a risk assessment process that we go through which we do with the farmer before the children are anywhere near the farm. Then we do a pre-visit with the teacher.\u0026#8216We go out with the teacher and the farmer and we do a pre-visit so that everyone knows what’s going to happen on the day when the children arrive.\u0026#8216On the day of the visit the farmer will make sure there’s no dangerous machinery sitting out or there’s not a hole being dug near to where we’ll be. We work closely with the host to make the site as safe as possible.\u0026#8216I would say common sense and supervision are the main things for any farm visit. We don’t want to make it all rules and regulations, so they can’t enjoy themselves. But there must be an element of control. We do tend to let them enjoy themselves and have a bit of fun because that’s the best way for them to learn.\u0026#8216We have a plan for every visit before we turn up, we have a plan of what we are going to do and where we’re going to take them.\u0026#8216Before leaving the farm they wash their hands with antibacterial soap, running water and paper towels, so there’s no contamination.

Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.

Among the issues highlighted at the public meeting were long waits to get through to the surgery by telephone failure of repeat prescriptions poor communication with patients very long waiting times to see a named GP lack of continuity of care and treatment difficulties with NHS 24 and test results not being given out by doctors.  Concerns were also raised about GP training and recruitment, the area\u0026rsquos growing population causing additional pressures on local health services, the cost of calling the surgery and the idea of an online booking system.  Last Wednesday, Ms Dugdale asked the Scottish Government what discussions it has had with NHS Lothian regarding general practitioner services in Musselburgh.  Shona Robison, who was Cabinet Secretary for Health and Sport at the time, said: \u0026ldquoNHS 24 is delivering a pilot at the Riverside GP practice in Musselburgh whereby it is triaging patients who have requested same-day GP appointments. Where appropriate, NHS 24 will signpost patients to areas of the primary care system that are better placed to meet their needs, often more swiftly. \u0026ldquoIndications are that the pilot is working well, with a number of patients signposted to more appropriate support, freeing up GPs to deal with patients with more complex needs. A full evaluation is underway with a report due in the coming weeks, which will be shared with health boards and integration authorities.  Ms Dugdale commented: \u0026ldquoEarlier this month, 200 angry Musselburgh residents turned out at a public meeting because they have had real and persistent difficulties in accessing GPs locally. They do not think that the pilot is working that well. Many of the problems are caused by a GP shortage - a point that the practice and the British Medical Association have acknowledged. Can the cabinet secretary explain to my constituents why they have to phone NHS 24 to see their GP and when she expects Scotland\u0026rsquos GP shortage to be resolved?  Ms Robison said: \u0026ldquoThe pilot that NHS 24 is running is a system that has worked well elsewhere and that has had strong evaluation, so I urge Kezia Dugdale to wait for the formal evaluation of the pilot. I am happy for her to be furnished with the evaluation if she would be interested in that.  \u0026ldquoWith regard to the way forward for general practice, she will be aware of the new contract that has been put in place with substantial resources to back it up. In this financial year, we will invest \u0026pound100 million to support the new contract, and we also have the ambition to increase the number of GPs by at least 800 over the next 10 years. In addition, the multidisciplinary team will make sure that we can reduce the workload of GPs.  Mr Whitfield told the Courier: \u0026ldquoAt the recent GP public meeting, Kezia and I agreed to take the concerns raised back to the practice, but also to NHS Lothian and the Scottish Government. Kezia has acted swiftly to challenge the Health Secretary on the issue and demand she does more to alleviate the problems experienced in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoWe have also passed on the issues and questions highlighted at the meeting to the practice. Once we receive a response we will share it with those who attended. We will also keep up the pressure locally and nationally for further action to help patients here receive the service they need.  Mr Dugdale later said the appropriate steps needed to be taken to support \u0026ldquostruggling GP practices and prevent further closures.  Miles Briggs, Lothian Conservative MSP, who also took part in the Holyrood debate, later said: \u0026ldquoThe Health Secretary\u0026rsquos assurance that the pilot is working well in Musselburgh is totally at odds with the experience of many local patients who have expressed very real concerns about delays in getting through and arranging a routine GP appointment.  \u0026ldquoMinisters and NHS Lothian need to respond to what are genuine issues being experienced by local residents and to take urgent action to address these."},{"url":null,"title":"harry-potter-stars-are-heading-to-musselburgh-this-summer","story":"  Stars of the movies will be taking part in the summer event which is being held at Loretto School and raising funds for Children\u0026rsquos Hospices Across Scotland (CHAS).

A planning application for the substation by Inch Cape Offshore Limited (ICOL) was called in by Scottish Ministers in a controversial move in April and will now be decided by the reporter instead of the council.  ICOL wants to bring offshore energy from a planned windfarm off the Angus coast onto land at Cockenzie by building the substation on the footprint of the former power station.  A previous planning application siting the substation further inland had been given planning permission but that permission lapsed instead of renewing it, ICOL decided to pursue a new site.  In its argument to Scottish Ministers, the council will state that the substation is \u0026ldquonot the best use of the land and point out that planning permission had been given at another site.  Councillor Norman Hampshire said: \u0026ldquoBecause of the location, we have to recommend it should be refused. We have done a lot of work to move this proposal forward and this action jeopardises that.  \u0026ldquoI think if everybody had worked together we could have got a development on a site the council, developers and communities could have supported.  Earlier this month, representatives of ICOL were challenged by Prestonpans Community Council to name any independent party that support the planned location of the substation.  Brian Weddell, community council chairman, told the ICOL representatives that there had been no public consultation about the new site.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe are against it, Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council are against it, East Lothian Council and Scottish Natural Heritage are against it.  \u0026ldquoShow us anyone, apart from Inch Cape, who think it is a good site.  Ian Johnson, ICOL project manager, said: \u0026ldquoWe are naturally disappointed that East Lothian Council officers have recommended refusal to the application on the grounds that it could prejudice future development of the area. ICOL have been and will continue to work with the council to look at options to reduce the footprint of the site and ensure that other potential future developments can co-exist next to the substation.  However, he made it clear there were no plans to consider an alternative site, telling the Courier: \u0026ldquoWe have no intention of moving the proposed site of the onshore transmission works again.

Boasting one of the oldest golf courses in the world \u0026ndash Musselburgh Links, The Old Course \u0026ndash the town was once home to the Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers, who now play at Muirfield, near Gullane.  The Honourable Company brought other Edinburgh clubs to the town such as Royal Burgess, Bruntsfield and the Warrender.  The exhibition celebrates the days from 1836 to the early 20th century when Musselburgh was at the forefront of the game\u0026rsquos development.  It not only celebrates the golf clubs which played in the town over the years but also the many golf club and ball makers, and professional players, who made their living in the town between 1836 and 1900 \u0026ndash a period of dramatic growth in the game.  The display has been organised by Musselburgh Museum and Heritage Group in partnership with Mungo Park, whose great-grandfather Willie Park Senior, from Wallyford, won the first Open Championship at Prestwick in 1860 and went on to be a four-time Open champion.  Willie\u0026rsquos brother Mungo and son Willie Junior were also Open champions at Musselburgh Links.  Two other local men \u0026ndash Bob Ferguson, who won a hat-trick of Open Championships, and David Brown \u0026ndash complete the town\u0026rsquos five Open champions, with 11 wins between them.  Support for the exhibition has also been received from East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos economic development and strategic investment department and Musselburgh Common Good Fund.  The exhibition, which runs from July 6 to September 1, is to be officially opened by Lord Wemyss, whose family has been involved with golf since the early 18th century.  On display are a large number of golf items and memorabilia donated by golf clubs that were formerly located at Musselburgh Links. Artefacts from the British Golf Museum and private collections can also be viewed.  The exhibition includes significant artefacts that have not been seen publicly in Scotland for decades, among them Charles Lees\u0026rsquo famous painting A Summer Evening on the Musselburgh Links: Golfers, which recently sold at Bonhams.

They also found five secondary tumours at the top of his spine.  By the age of 13, the brave teenager had completed a high dose of radiotherapy to his brain and spinal cord following a biopsy.  Despite his health challenges, Paul, who is now 30, received a Bachelor of Engineering with Honours in Computer Systems and Networks degree at a graduation ceremony at the Usher Hall last week.  His family, including mum Angela, 52, and sisters Laura, 34, and Aleigh, 21, were filled with pride to see him receive his degree.  He was also awarded the Rob Kemmer Prize, receiving \u0026pound100 in recognition of his \u0026ldquooutstanding achievements on his individual programme of study.  Paul, of Burns Wynd, is now planning to return to Napier after the summer to complete his Master\u0026rsquos Degree.

Angela revealed that Paul was a pupil at Musselburgh Grammar School when his condition was first diagnosed.  She said: \u0026ldquoPaul was having trouble with his eyesight and the school contacted me to say they thought it was getting worse.  \u0026ldquoIt was when he was referred to the Eye Pavilion in Edinburgh they discovered the tumours were the cause of it.  \u0026ldquoHe had multifocal germinoma tumours and secondary cancer caused the spinal lesions.  Although the radiotherapy cured his tumour, it had other detrimental effects.  Paul is registered blind as a result of the radiotherapy to his visual nerves and also has a curvature of the spine.  The pituitary gland in his brain has failed completely, so he needs to take hormone replacements and he also finds it difficult to open his jaw, which is thought to be due to scar tissue following radiotherapy.  It was when he was working as a volunteer at Musselburgh Citizens Advice Bureau that Paul first became interested in developing his computer skills, attending both Edinburgh College and Napier for four years.  Angela said: \u0026ldquoPaul doesn\u0026rsquot have an assistant at Napier and he travels there independently.  \u0026ldquoHe has some vision out of the side of one eye and the centre of the other.  \u0026ldquoThe university helped with extra large screens for him and giving him more time his teachers are all delighted for him.

A meeting of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos licensing board last Thursday heard that since the Peters took charge of the pub there had not been a single complaint about it.  Now the couple have applied for permission to turn the building next door \u0026ndash which currently operates as Jo\u0026rsquos Kitchen \u0026ndash into a pub which they plan to name the New Pheasant.  The name is a reference to the building\u0026rsquos previous history as The Pheasant pub before it shut in 2009.  Mr and Mrs Peters\u0026rsquo agent highlighted articles in the Courier to the licensing board that showed the problems at the Gardeners Arms before the couple took it over.  He said: \u0026ldquoBefore they took over there were some interesting Courier articles which described the pub as a disgrace.  \u0026ldquoSince they took over, the Courier articles were about a disgraced pub being turned around.  Applying for a major variation to the current licence held by Jo\u0026rsquos Kitchen, the agent said that the Peters\u0026rsquo current role managing the Gardeners Arms was coming to an end next month and they were keen to move on to their own establishment.  The board heard two objections had been received, along with two letters of support, all from neighbouring residents.  Both objections raised concerns about noise, as well as pointing out that there were already three pubs in the town with \u0026lsquoto let\u0026rsquo signs up. But the board was told the fact other pubs were available to let was not relevant.  Rudy Fruzynski, East Lothian licensing standards officer, told the board he was happy to support the application, confirming that there had been no complaints about the operation of the Gardeners Arms since the Peters took over.  He added: \u0026ldquoIn recent times, the anti-social behaviour team has received a substantial complaint made by a resident in the area complaining about late-evening noise with persons congregating on Market Street and using nearby Cross Lane as a thoroughfare from High Street.  \u0026ldquoThis problem cannot be directly attributed to licensed premises on Market Street. It is more likely to be related to the make-up of the area as a whole, being a focal point for persons seeking the services of many different types of business that are open in the evenings, particularly at weekends.  The board unanimously approved the application, with a request from Police Scotland agreed for children under the age of 15 to vacate the new premises by 8pm and 16 and 17-year-olds to leave by 10pm.  A request from Police Scotland for outdoor drinking hours to be reduced from 9pm to 8pm was not supported by the licensing board as it conflicted with the current hours for the Gardeners Arms."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/6802523.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"earwigs-eat-into-coastal-car-park-profits","story":"  Calls have been made for a detailed review of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos parking charges policy at the county\u0026rsquos coastal car parks amid claims by opponents that once the costs had been taken away the entire scheme only made a profit of about \u0026pound6,000 in its second year.  And council official admitted that while the income from the charges was increasing year on year, it was not expected to come close to the \u0026pound300,000 included in the administration\u0026rsquos budget for this financial year, with an estimated gross income of \u0026pound238,000 predicted.  It was also revealed at a meeting of the council\u0026rsquos policy and performance review committee that the council pays the Earl of Wemyss one third of the income from Longniddry Bents car parks No 1, No 2 and No 3, on top of a \u0026pound10,000 lease, as the car parks are part of the Wemyss and March Estate.  Since the introduction of the charges in 2015, those three car parks have brought in just under \u0026pound75,000 in income.  In total, the money collected from the 10 coastal car park sites which charge since it was introduced has been \u0026pound343,212.45.  However, the cost of the scheme was questioned at the meeting.  East Lothian Council introduced a \u0026pound2-a-day charge for using the three Longniddry Bents car parks and those at Barn Ness, Gullane Bents, John Muir Country Park, Shore Road at Belhaven, Tyninghame Links, Whitesands and Yellowcraig in 2015.  The initial cost of introducing the scheme, which included ticketing machines, signs and introducing double yellow lines at various locations, was about \u0026pound900,000.  A further \u0026pound425,000 is earmarked to be invested this year in improving toilet facilities at the Longniddry car parks.  Season passes are available for \u0026pound40 a year and just under 3,000 are currently being used.  A report on the income from the car parks revealed that in its first year the scheme brought in \u0026pound98,795 with costs of \u0026pound4,977.  However, it said in its second year the gross income was just over \u0026pound169,000 while costs rose substantially to nearly \u0026pound94,000.  In the last financial year, gross income grew to \u0026pound188,000 while the costs were at about \u0026pound83,000.  Among the reasons given for the rise in costs were \u0026pound55,000 which is paid towards East Lothian\u0026rsquos private parking attendants and the cost of replacing machines which had been vandalised by people trying to break into them, as well as rental fees for the Longniddry car parks and payment to a private company which collects the money from the machines and provides IT access so they can be monitored.  Peter Forsyth, service manager with the council, said the cost of replacing four machines last year had been \u0026pound25,000 and he revealed there was an unusual bug problem.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe have been affected by equipment failure due to bugs, earwigs and such, who like to nest in the equipment. They are not covered by our warranty.  Councillor Paul McLennan, who is part of the SNP Group which has opposed the car park fees from the start, said he estimated that, between costs of the scheme and interest generated from the initial loans, in its second year it would have made just \u0026pound6,000 profit.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe business case is not stacking up.  However, Jim Lamond, the council\u0026rsquos head of finance, said the scheme was never intended to make profits.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt is not in the budget as an income-generating activity. It is in there for improving the coastal car parks and ultimately that has been done.  Councillor Jeremy Findlay (Con) said people in his ward in Gullane did not feel they were seeing improvement in facilities at their car park. He said: \u0026ldquoIt was sold to people as a way to invest in facilities and they are not seeing it.  However, Councillor John McMillan (Lab), cabinet spokesperson for economic development, said a review would have to take in the bigger picture.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt needs to look at the impact on economic development and benefits it is bringing into East Lothian as well.  The committee agreed to ask for a detailed review of the scheme."},{"url":null,"title":"delve-into-haddingtons-history-this-summer","story":"  An exhibition of the history of Haddington opened its doors at the John Gray Centre last week in the town as it celebrates 700 years since King Robert The Bruce awarded it a Royal Charter.  The collection looks at seven centuries of life in the town and was officially opened by Provost John McMillan who brought along a portrait of his grandfather, who shared his name and joined the army in 1918 as one of many underage young men keen to defend their country.  Mr McMillan said he hoped the exhibition would encourage people to explore their own family history and look into their ancestry.  The Bruce Charter, which is the oldest document held in the John Gray archives, is not on display during the exhibition because it has to be kept in conservation conditions, but people can view it during the archive\u0027s opening hours.  Some of the less ancient items were on display at the Haddington Show at the weekend when archivists from the centre set up a stall in the crafts tent.  There they displayed some old images from shows gone by and a book of the show\u0027s records from 1820.  Interestingly some of the family names in the nearly 200-year-old records were still well know in the communities.  Exploring themes such as royalty, religion, health, education, wartime and crime and punishment, the exhibition aims to bring stories from the archives to life.  Haddington was one of the most important towns in medieval Scotland, and even had a royal palace, the birthplace of King Alexander II.  One of the items on display is a sick note from Mary Queen of Scots \u0026ndash the Queen asks the burgh to excuse Philip Gibson from military service because he was too corpulent to ride his horse!  Other characters featured include Agnes Blaik and Elizabeth Golight, two ladies of ill repute who were accused of entertaining dragoons. Both were convicted \u0026ndash Elizabeth Golight in particular was named a \u0026lsquovicious strumpet\u0026rsquo by the court. They were sentenced to stand at the market cross with a paper announcing their crime attached to their clothes, and thereafter they were to be drummed out of the town.  In medieval Haddington crime certainly did not pay and punishments were harsh. Criminals could be sentenced to death and the burgh account books include costs for building the gallows and the purchase of ropes for executions.  Gallows Green (where Bellevue House stands) gets its name from being the place the gallows were situated, and there is evidence that hangings also took place from the Nungate bridge.  Punishments for lesser crimes were harsh and cruel \u0026ndash those caught stealing could be sentenced to a whipping by the hangman, banished from the burgh, branded with the town key, or have an ear nailed to the pillory post!  While much of the exhibition concentrates on the medieval period more modern topics including the Glasgow Overspill are featured.  In 1958 Haddington signed the first Overspill Agreement in Scotland with Glasgow which was bursting at the seams with a post war housing crisis while other parts of the country were sparse. Haddington Town Council agreed to provide 250 houses for Glasgow families, increasing the town\u0027s population by 20 per cent.  which would result in a 20% increase in population. The original Overspill Agreement is on display in the exhibition.  This exhibition offers a glimpse into the lives of the townspeople of the past, and tries to demonstrate the central role Haddington played in events of national significance. Seven Centuries of Haddington is on display until the end of September and is well worth a visit."},{"url":null,"title":"new-life-coming-for-pub","story":"  Officers were called to the Masons Arms on Belhaven High Street at 6.50am on March 31 following an undisclosed incident.

In April, Police Scotland asked East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos licensing board to review the pub\u0026rsquos licence and that of its manager Christopher Darling.  However, at a meeting last week, the board was told that Mr Darling had parted company with the pub owners and the premises was currently closed.  James Hughes, who currently runs Dunbar Golf Club, asked the board to consider transferring the licence to him as he revealed ambitious plans to invest \u0026pound50,000 in the business with a view to eventually taking ownership of the property.  Mr Hughes told the board that he was preparing to sign a five-year-lease of the pub with its current owner in a deal which would allow him to buy it at the end of the lease.  He said that there were plans to renovate the building to open it up more and make it a family-friendly site.  Mr Hughes told the meeting: \u0026ldquoWe plan to make it a good country food and beer premises.  \u0026ldquoIt is in an area steeped in history with [Belhaven] Brewery and a popular tourism area, and we want to turn it into a good welcoming family pub.  Mr Hughes, who has been at Dunbar Golf Club for several years, told the board he had more than 23 years of experience in the licensed trade and had worked in Edinburgh before moving to East Lothian.  He said that if given approval to go ahead the pub could re-open early next year.

A ClubGolf mass participation session was then held over lunchtime to give all children at the school a chance to experience golf, using everything from plastic ClubGolf equipment, professional clubs and golf balls to Scottish Golf inflatable nets.  About 14,000 primary and high school pupils in East Lothian have been visited at their schools as part of the trophies tour in the run-up to the Scottish Open, which takes place from next Thursday (July 12), and the Ladies\u0026rsquo Scottish Open which begins on Thursday, July 26.  Mr Martin said: \u0026ldquoThe trophies tour finale at Sanderson\u0026rsquos Wynd was an amazing day and these children not only got to see the trophies up close but also got to grill a brilliant professional athlete in Beth Allen. It was also fantastic to give them the opportunity to swing a golf club for the first time.  \u0026ldquoI hope that the trophy tour has inspired children across East Lothian to come down to Gullane in July and continue to get involved in golf.

Assembly host Bryden McKinnie, told the Courier, he received news from the Food Assembly UK operators on Friday afternoon that they were no longer operating in the UK.  The assemblies, which started in France, have been operating across the UK for five years.  They provide local hosts with the support to set up a website where local producers can offer their goods for sale and customers can browse online filling a \"shopping basket\" with products from a number of different companies.  They then collect all their shopping at one place on a set evening of the week.  The Haddington Assembly has held weekly collections at the Maitlandfield House Hotel since it began, with a wide range of local suppliers.  More than 1250 people have become members of the assembly in East Lothian but host Bryden said one of the issues to faced was building regular customers to make it sustainable.  He said of the 100 plus members only around 50 shop with any regularity and if the assembly was to continue in another form it was important to understand what stopped the other members from using it.  He said: \"It is difficult to sustain when you do not have a lot of regular shoppers, and this is a common thread among all the UK food assemblies.  \"We are talking to each other and looking at whether we can come up with a new way of operating, the announcement from the Food Assembly came as a shock and has really rocked everyone, but we are looking to the future.\"  The Haddington Food Assembly will stop at the end of this month.  However Mr McKinnie said alternatives would be looked at if it received a boost in its support.  He said: \"During the summer months orders can fall as low as 10 a week which is not sustainable. It really is a case of \"use it or lose it\".\"  A spokesperson for the Food Assembly said no public statement on the withdrawal was being made before the end of August.  She said: \"The announcement has been made to our network of hosts and producers, many of them will communicate to their members when they are ready, and we will do a public communication in August.\""},{"url":null,"title":"talented-teenage-drummer-clara-wilberforce-joins-national-youth-pipe-band-of-scotland","story":"  Clara Wilberforce, who has been playing the snare drum since she was in P6 at King\u0026rsquos Meadow Primary School, has linked up with the National Youth Pipe Band of Scotland\u0026rsquos development band.  That came after a rigorous audition process, which saw the 15-year-old perform to a group of judges.  Proud mum Juliet told the Courier it had been an eventful period from the audition to finding out that Clara had been successful.  She said: \u0026ldquoShe went to the National Piping Centre in Glasgow and she did her audition and she came out and said \u0026lsquoI did so badly, I messed up\u0026rsquo.  \u0026ldquoShe was so disappointed and I said to her that she was very young.  \u0026ldquoShe was terribly disappointed but I said \u0026lsquonever mind, you are young and will get another chance another year\u0026rsquo.  \u0026ldquoShe had been in tears and she felt she let herself down.  \u0026ldquoWe forgot all about it and then suddenly emails were coming through to her and myself.  \u0026ldquoShe came tearing down the stairs screaming at the top of her voice that she got into the development band.  \u0026ldquoShe was running round the house, up and down the stairs screaming with joy.  Her first event will feature Phil Cunningham and Aly Bain at the Phil and Aly RSNO St Andrew\u0026rsquos Day Concert at the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall on November 25.

Clara, who is in S5 at Knox Academy and studying Higher maths, English, geography and human biology, is also a member of the school\u0026rsquos pipe band as well as Haddington Pipe Band, where she is a senior drummer.  Her mum, who praised the efforts of Davey Barnes, who runs Knox Academy Pipe Band, and Dave Henry, drum teacher, said Clara \u0026ldquoloves the drumming and she had made a number of good friends through music and boosted her confidence.  Alastair Bruce, chairman of Haddington Pipe Band, congratulated Clara, who lives in the town, on the achievement.  The youngster won the band\u0026rsquos Niall Fairgrieve Award in 2014 for most improved drummer and has continued to impress.

Now his son Kit, who lives in Belhaven, has released a new version of the tale which looks at Chris\u0026rsquo 30-year career with the company, its characters and ships.  The company, which provides a link to many of the Scottish islands from the mainland, dates back to 1851 and has become famous for the red and black funnel, complete with the Lion Rampant, on its ships.  Kit said: \u0026ldquoWe self-published it the first time and having, finally, persuaded him to write down all the stories I found a way of getting it published.  \u0026ldquoWe printed about 400 copies and the punchline is, despite him giving a few away, we got enough money back to cover the publication cost.  \u0026ldquoAs far as I know it is sold out \u0026ndash I have got a copy and so do both my sons but I think that is about it.  \u0026ldquoThe reason we published it in the first place was, certainly to us, the highly entertaining stories about MacBrayne.  \u0026ldquoThere was a lot in it about his army service and, after coming back to it after all those years, the reason for publishing it again was just to make sure those reflections on a way of life long gone did not die with him.  Kit \u0026ndash who last year released The Triumph and Tragedy of the Bantams, which focused on a band of \u0026ldquobrave but largely forgotten soldiers \u0026ndash has added his own stories of being a \u0026lsquoMacBrayne Child\u0026rsquo.  He added that his dad was known as the \u0026lsquostoryteller\u0026rsquo in the family and he wanted to make sure the stories were available to a new generation.

The 51-year-old, whose nephew is Scotland rugby star Huw Jones, has driven a taxi for nine years to pay his way through university and has built his own film studio and edit suite at his home in Longniddry.  The dad-of-three said: \u0026ldquoThe TV course has been a brilliant journey.  \u0026ldquoColleagues often ask where I find my energy, and sometimes I have to ask myself the same thing, especially at 4am when I have forgotten to go to bed. Perhaps my endurance and resilience comes from my 12 years as a commando.  \u0026ldquoThere have been sacrifices, the biggest of them being to have had no social life throughout this time, but I am passionate about television and I am now talking to production companies and hoping to make my mark in the documentary genre.  While Matt admits it was \u0026ldquoeasy to feel envious of weekend revellers partying, he said driving taxis allowed him to refine his interview skills for his TV career ahead.  And among those to grace the back seat of his cab over the last nine years have been the likes of Angus Deayton, Ian Lavender, Paul Merton, Alexei Sayle, Ruth Madoc and Steven Berkoff.  Matt, who served with the Royal Marines in Northern Ireland, has already completed a music production with National Museums Scotland for a new exhibition on Scottish pop from the 1950s to present day. The classical music enthusiast and trumpeter has also worked on a documentary about Felix Mendelssohn and is currently working on one on Fryderyk Chopin.

Svetlana Kondakova and Maja Quille, graduates of Edinburgh College of Art, worked on \u0026lsquoMusselburgh Archer\u0026rsquo, a life-size bronze cast of an archer and 12 steel arrows which will create a trail around the town.  In a joint statement, they said: \u0026ldquoWe hope that the artwork will link the heritage of Musselburgh to the modern day, as well as providing an interactive element of activity for both locals and visitors with the trail.  The lifesize figure represents layers of local history including the Roman invasion in AD 80, the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh in 1547 and the Musselburgh Silver Arrow, which dates back to 1603 and is claimed to be the oldest sporting trophy in the world still competed for annually.  The artwork will be completed with a series of stainless steel arrows installed at different locations around Musselburgh. They are expected to be installed later this summer and will form a trail around the town to areas of cultural, historical, natural and community significance, supported by a Global Treasure App organised by Musselburgh Area Partnership.  Councillor Jim Goodfellow, cabinet spokesperson for community wellbeing, said: \u0026ldquoThis is a striking piece of art that represents so many aspects of local history. Residents of Musselburgh and visitors will no doubt appreciate this latest addition to the public art within the community.  Michael Johnson of Nottinghamshire created \u0026lsquoThe Mussel\u0026rsquo with input from local schoolchildren, and its installation was recently highlighted in the Courier.

East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos Arts Service formed a working group to select and commission artists to create the new public artwork. The group included representatives from Musselburgh Area Partnership, Musselburgh and Inveresk Community Council, Musselburgh Conservation society, East Lothian Council officers, councillors and other community representatives.

Dunbar and East Linton ward member Councillor Norman Hampshire encouraged members of the public to go along and have their say.  He said: \u0026ldquoThere is a high demand for the parks that we have in Dunbar.  \u0026ldquoAs the town grows in size, we have got to make sure we make best use of every bit of green space that we have.  A proposed theme for the park would be to celebrate the varied geology of the county.  Information cairns and distance markers could be created around a circular path.  The creation of paths, additional trim trail equipment and the retention of the putting green are among the ideas highlighted, as well as a new football area with permanent goals.  However, potentially the most ambitious aspect of the scheme is the creation of a new pavilion with access to public toilets.  The potential of a pavilion comes after Winterfield Pagoda, which dated back to the 1920s, was torn down in March last year.  Capital investment could also be made in a tree shelter belt, rural parkour \u0026ndash or free-running \u0026ndash elements in timber and additional benches and seating.  Another major project could be the creation of \u0026ldquoa low-key but iconic \u0026lsquogateway\u0026rsquo feature which would welcome walkers off the John Muir Way and into the park.

Five of those who lost weight suffered a \u0026ldquosignificant loss, according to the report by the Care Inspectorate officers who visited the home during an unannounced three-day inspection in May.  East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership confirmed it had suspended admission to the home following the report, which has now been fully revealed, after it emerged last month the home had been ordered to make urgent improvements after inspectors raised \u0026ldquoserious concerns.  HC-One, which operates the home, says it has introduced a new home manager and it pointed to some of the more \u0026ldquopositive comments in the report which acknowledged staff were praised for their approach to residents.  A spokesperson for HC-One said: \u0026ldquoThe health and wellbeing of our residents is our highest priority and we take all feedback from the Care Inspectorate extremely seriously. We are pleased their full report included some positive comments about the home, particularly noting our staff team are \u0026lsquokind and caring\u0026rsquo in their approach to residents.  \u0026ldquoWe also recognise we need to do better in some other areas. To do this, we have a new home manager in place who is being supported by the wider management team, and we continue to work closely with the Care Inspectorate and relevant authorities as we implement our improvement plan.  \u0026ldquoWe are pleased significant positive progress has already been made, and are confident the home is in a better place than at the time of the original inspection.  \u0026ldquoWe will continue working hard each and every day so that we are consistently providing the standard of care that Residents deserve.  \u0026ldquoThe Care Inspectorate have recently returned to the home to commence a new inspection, and we look forward to demonstrating the positive changes to them.  Drummohr is the second nursing home in East Lothian operated by HC-One to have admissions suspended in two years.  In 2016, Tranent Care Home was temporarily stopped from admitting new residents by the partnership, which oversees adult care services, after reports of residents being ignored as they asked for help to eat, with others eating with their fingers because of a lack of cutlery or being unable to cut their food themselves, while others were seen wearing clothes soiled or left unchanged after spilling food on themselves.  The report into Drummohr said: \u0026ldquoThere was a lack of oversight and management of food and fluid intake in the home. Nineteen residents were recorded as having lost weight in March 2018. Five had significant weight loss.  \u0026ldquoWe observed instances where residents did not take their meal and nothing else was offered, teas were often left cold and untouched and one resident walked around taking others\u0026rsquo meals and drinks.  \u0026ldquoWe also noted that there was specific guidance in a care file from the dietician in respect of food and fluids that one resident could have. The instructions were not followed. These issues, together with the lack of guidance to staff in respect of monitoring, recording and evaluating intake, is concerning.  The report added that \u0026ldquosome of this lack of care could be attributed to a lack of staff.  Drummohr scored a 2 out of 5 on all four areas inspected, a score regarded as \u0026lsquoweak\u0026rsquo. The four areas were quality of care and support environment staffing and management and leadership.  An East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe wellbeing of residents is always our paramount concern and in this case we will continue working closely with Care Inspectorate to ensure that HC-One delivers the required improvements as soon as possible.  \u0026ldquoAs an interim measure, we have decided to suspend new admissions to Drummohr to enable staff there to focus on what needs to be done.

WHAT do we remember of our childhood in our later days? Think for a moment of the key happy memories which have framed your childhood. They are often simple ones involving play outside. Sadly, research is showing that children are increasingly less able to explore and play in the outdoors.  There are various reasons for this and there is a horrible irony at the centre of it. We have become far more obsessed with material things, it\u0026rsquos all around us. We are literally buying into the idea that happiness is about purchase and we are passing this on to our children.  It\u0026rsquos in our brains that the economy needs us to spend our money on things we don\u0026rsquot need. We are fed an ideology that spending money on stuff is not just a pleasure but a civic duty. It keeps the economy going and makes us all prosperous. That\u0026rsquos what we are made to believe.  But the result is that more than ever, for our children and ourselves, we are enslaved to the interests of corporate profit at the expense of what really matters: simple time to be and enjoy free pleasures.  These were my thoughts as I set off for the second of this summer\u0026rsquos journeys of discovery. I didn\u0026rsquot share them at the time, and of course I stopped thinking about them as the magic of the wood engulfed us.  We began our journey amongst yew trees which surrounded the ancient kirk of Garvald. It was a scorching day and the shade of trees was such a relief. The plan was to spend the day exploring the wood and discover Stoneypath Castle.  Garvald Kirk has a simple beauty. While parts of its wall are 800 years old, it has been subject to renovation and alteration over the last 200 years. There is a welcoming atmosphere inside and I reflected that when not being used for services it would make a perfect storytelling venue.  By the door there is a reminder of how religion can change its spots. A set of jougs hangs on the wall: an iron collar and chain once used to humiliate and degrade \u0026lsquosinners\u0026rsquo by chaining them up. The victims of this would have been mainly young women who became pregnant out of wedlock.  It\u0026rsquos right that it remains there, I think, as a reminder that religion can be used as a justification for intolerance, hate and cruelty as well as a source for love and compassion. The choice of which version to adhere to is a human one.  We followed the rabbits which scattered from the kirkyard into the wood. I was surprised that the Papana Water, which flows through the wood, was so full given there had been no real rain for weeks  It\u0026rsquos impossible to be bored in a wood. Hours were soaked up under the cooling shade of the tree canopy. It was quite simply a day of utter magic. We had our picnic under the shade of two giant Scots pine trees with the sound of running water in the background. It was the only real quiet moment in what would be hours of constant play. The kids just sat for a while, listening to the running water, and looking up at the trees. It was a communion of simple joy.  The walk isn\u0026rsquot so long in distance but it took us around five hours to complete. It could be done in 20 minutes or less if you just walk. But we didn\u0026rsquot just walk, we explored. There are three bridges which cross the Papana. Each one had a different attraction. Shoes were soon off and clothes got wet but the heat meant none of this mattered. A new game was devised when our youngest, Lewis, tried to use a piece of half-eaten banana as a substitute for a stick while playing \u0026lsquoPoohsticks\u0026rsquo . The girls rushed into the river to reclaim it, but then came up with a new game \u0026lsquohunt the banana\u0026rsquo.  After spending time at various points by the river, getting wet and discovering lots of things, we finally reached the walk\u0026rsquos end: Stoneypath Tower. It suddenly appears above the trees as if out of a fairy tale, its newly restored red walls and parapets a contrast to the green we were surrounded by.  There is much history in the castle, but then again there is history in the woods and hills.  As we headed back to Garvald the kids were quieter, tired by adventure, but in a joyful way. The image of my kids standing in the water, playing and searching for fish seemed to symbolise something immemorial: a powerful and simple truth that what we really need is an immersion in nature, not stuff that hijacks our wellbeing in the name of profit.  We surely stepped on the footprints of Robert Neillans on our return. He was a well-known cooper who lived in Garvald over 200 years ago. Perhaps he came foraging here, I thought. As the water sparkled in the sunshine I reflected that the making of \u0026lsquoillicit whisky\u0026rsquo was once common hereabouts and that Robert was, according to local historian Irene Anderson, one of those involved.  We walked past the house he built on the banks of the Papana when we returned to Garvald. What tales this village could tell!  We\u0026rsquod been \u0026lsquoaway\u0026rsquo for a total of nearly six hours in a magic place. But we\u0026rsquod met only one person walking her dog. In one sense that was a joy, and the absence of litter was another.  But it was tinged with a sense of sadness that the magic is something being lost to so many of us, and indeed that so many of the magic places are themselves being lost.  But my melancholy did not last long. It was a day of joy and we thanked the wood as we left."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8067093.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"day-two-of-the-aberdeen-standard-investments-scottish-open-at-gullane-golf-club","story":"  Rock is 13-under-par, two shots better off ellow countryman Tyrell Hatton.

A tribute on the Edinburgh RC website stated: \u0026ldquoEdinburgh RC would like to mark the life of former club member Ben Forsyth which sadly ended on July 1.  \u0026ldquoHe was a stalwart member of the youth section until he joined the Spokes race team in 2014.  \u0026ldquoThe pinnacle of his cycling achievements was winning the British youth circuit race championship in 2013 on the promenade at Blackpool in an ERC jersey.

Taylor Wimpey East Scotland has teamed up with Mactaggart and Mickel Homes \u0026ndash both of which are already building on the adjacent Letham Mains site, where more than 800 homes are being built \u0026ndash for the plans on Haddington\u0026rsquos south-western edge.  The early proposals, which will be unveiled to the public later this year, show about 300 homes, with a quarter of those being affordable.  Included in the plans are provision for roads and drainage infrastructure, off-site road improvements, as well as land being set aside for play areas and open space.  The Proposal of Application Notice (PAN) is the first step in the planning process, with the idea of housing on the site, off the A6093.  The land outlined for the development is identified for housing in the new Local Development Plan and, according to the developers, will be designed to integrate with the Letham Mains development.  The public exhibition will give both housebuilders the opportunity to share their proposals for the development with members of the public and other interested parties, and for feedback to be passed to the developer.  A detailed planning application is expected later this year.  Joanne Casey, director of Mactaggart \u0026amp Mickel Homes, speaking on behalf of both developers, said the PAN allowed the developers to \u0026ldquobegin the important process of community engagement.  She said: \u0026ldquoWe are fully committed to a detailed programme of engagement with local communities throughout the lifetime of our developments.  \u0026ldquoFor large-scale development projects like this one at Letham Holdings, we are especially keen to fully engage as early as possible in the overall process to allow us to understand and consider the views from as many stakeholders as we can.  \u0026ldquoWe will hold a joint public consultation event during the next few months and we would like to take this opportunity to encourage all interested individuals to become involved.  \u0026ldquoThis event will allow the local community to share their views so that we may consider these as we develop our emerging development proposal in order to make a detailed planning application around October this year."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8064331.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"east-lothians-chief-nurse-takes-on-health-director-role","story":"  Alison Macdonald has been appointed to replace David Small, who left the post last month to take up a new role as director of primary care transition with NHS Lothian.

The 63-year-old passed away on March 2, having been minister at St Mary\u0026rsquos Parish Church for more than a decade.  Now her sister Susan Gibson, along with daughters Laura Burgess and Elaine Macrae, will be joined by nieces Clare Furze and Kara Wallace and granddaughters Ciara Burgess and Isla Burgess in the running-themed fundraisers.  Susan said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom the runner in the family and I have always done a fundraising event every year.  \u0026ldquoJennifer was a great supporter, she was not a runner herself but she would tease me about the time I had done at the event.  \u0026ldquoShe was a huge supporter and always contributed generously to what I was running for.  \u0026ldquoAfter she had the terminal diagnosis, one thing we talked about was that I would organise some kind of running thing for the family.  \u0026ldquoIt was her choice to go with Edinburgh Maggie\u0026rsquos Centre because she had such amazing support there.  The charity, which has been based in Edinburgh since 1996, offers support to people with cancer and their family and friends.  The centres offer not only practical advice about benefits and eating well but qualified experts provide emotional support and the centres offer a chance to meet people or simply sit quietly with a cup of tea.  Team Jenny, which includes seven-year-old Isla, will in varying combinations be clocking up nearly 200 kilometres of timed runs throughout the summer.  Originally, the plan was for the seven family members to take part together in the same event.  However, with the family spread out in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Coleraine, it proved impossible.  Instead they are taking on half a dozen different events before combining both the distance and fundraising totals together.  Elaine, 32, has already completed the Baker Hughes 10k in Aberdeen, while Kara, 28, and her husband, Duncan, will be joined by Clare, 32, Elaine and Susan at the Run the Blades event at Whitelee Wind Farm, near Eaglesham, this month.  Meanwhile in Portrush, Northern Ireland, Susan will join Laura, 36, together with her daughters Ciara, 13, and Isla, at the Portrush Park Run.  Clare, Elaine, Kara and Susan will all take part in the Great Aberdeen Run 10k next month before Susan\u0026rsquos attention turns to the Scottish 10k, which starts and finishes at Musselburgh Racecourse in September.  Finally, Elaine and Susan will take on the Great Scottish Run Half Marathon in Glasgow, with Laura\u0026rsquos husband Barry competing in the Belfast City Half Marathon in September.  The family set an initial fundraising target of \u0026pound1,000 before increasing that to \u0026pound3,000 but both have already been smashed, with nearly \u0026pound5,000 already raised.  Susan said: \u0026ldquoIt is amazing.  \u0026ldquoPeople are just so incredibly generous and I think that is a measure of Jennifer and Maggie\u0026rsquos and the affection and respect people have for Maggie\u0026rsquos.  \u0026ldquoWe are very fortunate it is a very close family.  \u0026ldquoJennifer was very caring, had a great sense of humour and she was honest.  \u0026ldquoYou could always depend on her \u0026ndash it might not be what you wanted to hear but what you needed to hear.  \u0026ldquoShe had that ability to be completely honest without ever being harsh or unkind.  \u0026ldquoShe was incredibly supportive of the family and everybody in it.

The 90-year-old, who also met Scotland\u0026rsquos new Health Secretary Jeane Freeman MSP, added: \u0026ldquoMy first memory of work was the knowledge that the hospital was getting much busier and there were more children coming in and going out cured. Before that, the parents couldn\u0026rsquot afford medical help and were leaving it too late for their children to come in and many of them didn\u0026rsquot make it.  \u0026ldquoAlso I remember saying to the sister I was working with at the time: \u0026lsquoThe parents coming in now have lost their terribly haunted look because they know now they can bring their children in.\u0026rsquo  She told how the nurses had to live on-site in those days and would therefore tend to give up work when they became married.  Mrs Reid added: \u0026ldquoWe weren\u0026rsquot allowed to live out of hospital, we had to stay in the nurses\u0026rsquo homes.  \u0026ldquoI loved it \u0026ndash I loved the camaraderie, I loved the company, I loved everything about it.  \u0026ldquoIt wasn\u0026rsquot all drudgery and hard work, we had lots of fun into the bargain.

At Islay Ales they produce a range of both cask and bottles conditioned beers. The bottled beers are real ale in a bottle. The beer is neither filtered nor pasteurised prior to being bottled and therefore continues to ferment and mature in the bottle. This process produces sediment in the bottom of the bottle.    They have recently started to make use of the fact that many individuals have bottled their own whisky on Islay and are looking for something special to do with the empty cask. They fill these casks with part of a brew and then allow the influences of the whisky and the wood to act on the beer by maturing it for at least six weeks up to almost three months, depending on the requirements of the customer.  This year Islay Ales were delighted to have been asked by WW100 Islay to produce an ale to commemorate the ending of the First World War and to remember those lives lost in the tragic sinking of two troops ships off Islay  Visitors are more than welcome to visit the Brewery, they are happy to show how the beers are brewed in the 4-barrel plant, which produces 1150 pints (640 litres) at a time. Depending on what day you come to the brewery you could see the brewing in action or it might be the casking, bottling or labelling, all of which takes place on site.  Before or after a tour of the brewery you can sample some of the available ales, sometimes Islay Ales might even have some on draught for you to try. You can also purchase bottles of the beers as well as Thistly Cross Cider. If you are looking for presents or something to remember them by, the Brewery shop has a range of clothing, glasses and other items.    The Brewery and shop is open from 10.30 to 5.00 Monday to Saturday during the summer but only to 4.00 in the winter. They generally do not open on Sundays unless a special request has been made.  A large number of establishments on Islay take the ales, either in bottle form or on draught so when you come to visit the island you are sure to be able to find Islay Ales near to where you are staying.  www.islayales  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------  The Brander Lodge  Nestled within a scenic and tranquil location, The Brander Lodge offers comfortable and stylish facilities for those looking to relax and explore.

According the Balornock church\u0027s website, the service was a \"Rosary of reparation for the gross offence to God which is Pride Glasgow.\"  Saturday\u0027s Pride march was led by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, who called the event \u0026ldquocelebrating and reaffirming the values of tolerance, diversity, equality, love and respect.  But last night Father Morris, who is the Catholic chaplain of Glasgow Caledonian University, held a service offering decades of the Rosary, Litany and Benediction in reparation for the LGBTI event.  Jordan Daly, Co-Founder of Time for Inclusive Education (TIE), which campaigns for inclusive education in schools, said it was \"sad and disappointing\" to see Father Morris\u0027s \"condemnation\" of the event.  He said: \"The Pride parade was, as always, a vibrant and colourful display of diversity, acceptance, and inclusivity.  \"The ethos of the parade is equality and love, so it is sad and disappointing to see that Father Morris has countered those fundamental values by holding this service and allowing a narrative of exclusion and condemnation to enter the mainstream as a result.\"  Father Morris celebrates Mass on Thursdays in the Faith and Belief Centre in the university\u0027s William Harley Building, and hears confession.  A spokesman for the Catholic Church in Glasgow said: \u0026ldquoThis was a private parish devotion unrelated\u0026nbspto Father\u0026nbspMorris\u0026rsquos role as chaplain.  Jordan added: \"We are concerned about the message that this could send to the young people of Glasgow Caledonian University, and so would like to stress that these predictable voices of opposition are becoming increasingly drowned out by a Catholic and wider faith community which is supportive of LGBT equality.  \"There were many people of faith who attended the Parade this weekend and in our efforts to advance LGBT-inclusive education in schools, we have been strongly supported by numerous Catholic Priests and their parishioners, as well as Church of Scotland and Scottish Episcopal Church ministers.  \"Our experience working with the Scottish Catholic Education Service as part of the Scottish Government\u0027s LGBT Inclusive Education Working Group has also been nothing but positive and productive.  \"We know that those who support the LGBT community outweigh those who endorse intolerance and I imagine that the number of attendees to this service in contrast with those who attended the Pride parade would further prove that.\"  Glasgow Caledonian University and the Catholic Church in Glasgow have been contacted for comment."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/8083985.jpg?type=article-full","title":"ghosts-have-a-dispiriting-effect-on-home-values-finds-study","story":"  At least that is the claim of a new study which reveals that supposedly haunted houses are having thousands of pounds wiped off their value the moment they are investigated for paranormal activity.  Statistician Dr Geoff Ellis said his study into 25 British \"haunted houses\", sold over the last half-century, revealed they lost an average of 17 per cent off their value compared with the sale prices of similar homes nearby.  What was said to be Scotland\u0027s most haunted house lay empty for decades before it was finally sold.  The eerie 18th century home, called Windhouse, nestled in the centre of a tiny island nature reserve, had only one permanent resident since the 1920s - a ghostly apparition known as the \"lady in silk\".    Legend had it the haunting was the result of one event, in the 19th century. The house\u0027s then-owner, a man called Harrison, decided that sheep would be more profitable than people and evicted his tenants in a mini Highland clearance.  One old lady, forced from her home, is said to have cursed Windhouse and everyone who would ever live in it.  Ghostly inhabitants have since included a lady dressed in silk who is believed to be the spirit of a woman whose skeleton was found under floorboards of the main stairs.  So called because of the rustling sound of her dress and petticoats, the ghoul was said to walk three times in a circle at the top of a flight of stairs, give a sigh, and then disappear.    The Grade-C listed home on Yell, Shetland which was first built in 1707 and then rebuilt in 1880, was eventually bought in 2003 by the couple from Cheshire who fell in love with the place and planned to renovate the castellated house. But it fell through.  Twelve years later the building which is on Historic Environment Scotland\u0027s buildings at risk register was put back on the market, with offers above \u0026pound25,000 and prospective purchasers were advised not to enter the site because of the building\u0027s extremely dangerous condition.  Dr Ellis\u0027s research suggests having a haunted house would knock almost \u0026pound40,000 off the average UK property price when it came to selling it.  A separate survey of 2,000 Britons found nearly one in four believed their houses were haunted, while 55% said they would be put off buying a haunted house.  The study, believed to be the first in the world looking at paranormal property, was commissioned by TV channel Really to mark the new series of Help! My House Is Haunted.    Barri Ghai, Sandy Lakdar and Chris Fleming from Help! My House is Haunted on Really  Adam Collings, Really channel director said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos staggering how much money could be wiped-off the value of your property, should you feel your house is haunted and eye-opening to see just how many of us have experienced spooky goings-on at home.  \"The research suggests it\u0026rsquos probably a good idea to keep your eyes peeled for paranormal activity when viewing a property, as your new house could become a very bad investment when you come to sell it, should it be found to be haunted.  The gloomy findings also found that well over half of the Scottish respondents (61%) say they\u0026rsquod be put off buying a haunted house, whilst 27% of property buyers have felt a spooky presence when viewing a house, which has put them off buying.  It certainly did not appear to put off Prince Charles who bought Dumfries House, a then dilapidated 18th century Scottish mansion that he saved for the nation at the 11th hour, 11 years ago.  It was put on the market and its contents were already on their way to an auction house ready to be sold off. But a group convened by the prince secured the property and its furniture for \u0026pound45m, with \u0026pound20m personally guaranteed by Charles himself.    The Duchess of Cornwall recently admitted that a visit to the rundown mansion soon after its purchase left her spooked and that she was unable to enter for several years after being convinced it was haunted.  \"It had a really eerie feel about it,\" she said. \"There was definitely a ghost. Without a shadow of a doubt. I remember the first time I walked up the steps, got into the hall and I thought I can\u0027t go any further. I literally froze. If my hair could stand on end, it would have done.  \"I remember leaving and thinking I don\u0027t want to come back here again and I didn\u0027t for a few years.\"  Camilla would later become more accustomed to the house\u0027s idiosyncrasies .  Given the survey results, it was perhaps unsurprising to find that eight in ten Scots (80%) polled said they would lie to their estate agent to cover up the fact their house was haunted to avoid the financial consequences."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/8084222.jpg?type=article-full","title":"baby-boomers-top-telly-addicts-as-youngsters-turn-to-tablets-instead","story":"  But now it appears that it is their parents and grandparents who could be facing life with letterbox vision after the first official report into Scotland\u0027s viewing habits revealed that it is they who are addicted to the goggle box.  A wide-ranging study of the nation\u0027s telly time has revealed that the over-55s have claimed the crown as the chieftain of the couch potato race, spending almost four times as much watching broadcasts compared to their offspring.  Last year, those heading for retirement age spent and nearly six hours a day transfixed by their living room screen, compared to just an hour and a half for those aged between 4 and 15.  And while the number of minutes whiled away by the older generation watching soaps, dramas and documentaries has fallen in recent years, it is still almost two hours greater than the national average of nearly four hours a day uncovered by Ofcom\u0027s first Media Nations Scotland report.  Overall, Scots watch more TV than people living in other parts of the UK, the report said, with viewers north of the border spending a daily average of three hours and 46 minutes in front of their sets - 24 minutes more than the UK average of three hours and 23 minutes.    And they are watching a wide range of programmes. The report delved into the most popular shows last year and found that terrestrial TV is still pulling in audiences in the millions.  It helps to go big \u0027event\u0027 TV, such as the final of Strictly Come Dancing the Mrs Brown\u0027s Boys Christmas special, pulled in the most viewers as did reality shows I\u0027m a Celebrity - Get Me Out of Here! and Britain\u0027s Got Talent.  But there was also a place for \u0027quality\u0027 television, with the ten-years-in-the-making series Blue Planet II and big-budget dramas Broadchurch and The Moorside also proving to be hits with the audience.  The Strictly final was the most-viewed broadcast programme on television across Scotland in 2017, with more than 1.1 million viewers tuning in to watch Scottish actor and Former Holby City star Joe McFadden and his partner Katya Jones lift the glitterball trophy.  Other hits for the year included the BBC\u0027s long-running Hogmanay show and its football-related stablemate Only and Excuse, Emmerdale, Coronation Street and Sherlock.  The BBC and ITV dominated terrestrial viewing habits, sharing all slots in a top-20 league table of the\u0026nbsp nation\u0027s most-watched programmes between them.  Yet while both channels remain strong, Ofcom found that people are slowly turning their backs on traditional TV.  On average, Scots are tuning in for 46 fewer minutes each day than they did eight years ago, and the decline is even steeper among children.  Youngsters have cut the amount of TV they consume each day by an hour - and the trend is accelerating.  But while people in Scotland are watching less broadcast television, they are spending more time watching other things such as online streaming on their TV set.    Daily viewing of non-broadcast content, such as YouTube and subscription on-demand services including Netflix and Amazon Prime Video, increased to 40 minutes.  BBC iPlayer was the most popular on-demand/streaming service among adults in Scotland in January 2018, with almost half saying they used it, followed by Netflix and the STV Player.  The report found the use of Netflix is \"heavily skewed towards younger viewers\".  While a third of adults in Scotland claim to use the service at least once a week, the number doubles among 16-24-year-olds while half of\u0026nbsp 25-34s say they use it.  But the service, which relies on an understanding of new technology, has not been taken up by baby boomers - with fewer than one in ten saying they tuned in.  The report said that the BBC, STV and ITV spent a combined \u0026pound53.9m on first-run, UK-made programmes for viewers in Scotland, an 8 per cet real-terms decrease year-on-year.  It said this decline was the result of lower spending by the BBC, down by 10 per cent year on year, while STV/ITV spending remained broadly stable.  The report also examined trends in the radio and audio sectors and found the amount of time people spent listening to digital radio has continued to grow, with two thirds of Scots now owning one.\u0026nbsp Almost nine in ten (88%) of adults listen to the radio every week.  On average, adults in Scotland spend 14 hours four minutes each week listening to any type of audio, the majority of it live radio.  Glenn Preston, Ofcom\u0027s Scotland Director, said: \"Today\u0027s research shows that the way people in Scotland watch TV is changing rapidly.  \"Although viewers in Scotland watch more TV than in the rest of the UK, they are spending less time watching \u0027traditional\u0027 broadcast TV and are turning to online streaming services, attracted by their exclusive programmes and vast libraries of classic shows.  \"Broadcasters in Scotland must confront the challenges posed by both online streaming companies and the changing way people are watching television, to ensure they continue to make great shows to appeal to Scottish viewers in the digital age.\""},{"url":null,"title":"so-scots-and-londoners-are-different-think-again","story":"  That is because a major new analysis of Britain\u0026rsquos most robust social attitudes survey shows that the UK capital shares more values with Scotland than with its own hinterland.  The National Centre for Social Research (NatCen) found Scots and Londoners were the most left-wing and liberal Britons with more in common with each other than with Wales and provincial England.  The new work overturns long-standing assumptions on both sides of the Border that Scotland has more cultural and political affinity with the north of England than the south.  Some 60 per cent of Scots identify as left-wing, compared with 58% of Londoners and just 51% of Northerners. But Londoners and Scots were also the most likely to back tax-and-spend policies and sympathise with people on welfare.  Neil Smith, research director at Natcen, said: \u0026ldquoWhile there are clear distinctions in the way Londoners think about certain social and political issues, in quite a few instances \u0026ndash despite the geographical distance and the different make-ups of our populations \u0026ndash Londoners share more in common with the Scots than with their regional neighbours. Both are more likely to be engaged in politics, have the greatest proportion of left-affiliated individuals, are more likely to fall on the pro-welfare end of the scale, and are most inclined to sympathise with benefit claimants.  The survey comes two years after Scotland and London emerged as the only two \u0026ldquoregions of the island of Britain to oppose Brexit.  London has become a stronghold for Labour in southern England. Its mayor, Sadiq Khan, shares the distinction with Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon of being \u0026ndash reports suggest \u0026ndash- despised by America\u0026rsquos populist right president.  Similar social attitudes may also reflect the rarely acknowledged reality that Scotland, collectively, has higher living standards and economic activity than anywhere in the UK bar London and the south-east.  The analysis is based on the British Social Attitudes Survey carried out by NatCen, and considered one of the best snap shots of what people think.  It was commissioned by Trust for London, a charity and think- tank. The Trust\u0026rsquos chief executive, Bharat Mehta, stressed what he saw as common values across the UK.  He said: \u0026ldquoPart of the story is the striking similarities between the attitudes of Londoners and those of Scots. The other part, is how on important issues like equality, education and public spending, Londoners hold comparable views to everyone else."},{"url":null,"title":"queen-guitarist-brian-may-to-celebrate-work-of-victorian-royal-photographer","story":"  George Washington Wilson, from Aberdeen, spearheaded a form of 3D imagery which captured the imagination of the musician a century later.

Concerns have previously been raised over the decline in the proportion of medical school places taken up by Scottish students compared to those from the rest of the UK and overseas, who are required to pay tuition fees.  Previous research has shown that Scottish students accounted for 63 per cent of the 1999/2000 intake for clinical medicine at Scotland\u0027s medical schools, but now make up around 50 per cent.  It has led to warnings that unless the share of medical school places allocated to Scots is increased, NHS Scotland will increasingly struggle to retain young doctors after their training is complete.  Evidence shows that Scottish-born doctors are statistically more likely to remain in Scotland after qualifying than those from the rest of the UK or abroad.  Scottish Conservative shadow health secretary Miles Briggs said: \u0026ldquoIf the SNP had maintained levels since coming to power, hundreds more young Scottish people would have had the opportunity to study medicine.  \u0026ldquoThis would have gone some way to solving the GP crisis we are currently facing across the country, not to mention some specific shortages in other areas.

It’s been inspiring to see them embrace this technology so quickly, often outperforming the adults in the room.”                                                                                                        Cara Hay, Depute Head Teacher at Strathburn Primary School, added: “We are extremely grateful to Expro for its generous donation towards the development of our Coding Club.

While I appreciate that Inverness is the larger and most busy airport, there is a real public perception that, at present, Inverness gets a lot of public money spent on it in terms of development and jobs, to the detriment of other regional airports.The Caithness, Sutherland and Ross MSP added: \u0026ldquoI have consistently made the case that Wick John O\u0026rsquoGroats Airport should be considered as a real possibility for the future of the air traffic control service in the Highlands, not least because of the real benefit and impact it would have on the socio-economic climate of the county.\u0026ldquoWe need sustainable, quality jobs and I am worried that this decision will limit many who have seen themselves as having a career in the aviation industry in the Highlands to only being based in Inverness.Mrs Ross added: \u0026ldquoIn May, the rural economy and connectivity committee, of which I am vice-chair, took evidence on this issue and were assured by the then minister, Humza Yousaf, that a full consultation and scoping exercise would take place and that there would be no decisions made until this work was carried out.\u0026ldquoI was very disappointed to learn of the decision to base the new service in Inverness, which seems like a real kick in the teeth to smaller airports that have been working hard to train, support and develop the expertise in their ATC staff.Trudy Morris, chief executive of the Caithness Chamber of Commerce, was also unhappy with the decision.She said: \u0026ldquoWe were extremely disappointed by the Hial board\u0026rsquos decision to select Inverness in principle as the location for a planned centralised air traffic management facility. Wick John O\u0026rsquoGroats Airport would have made an excellent base for this facility, and would have offered an opportunity for Hial to reverse the trend of centralisation of public services in Inverness.\u0026ldquoIt is our understanding that Inverness offered significant benefits to Hial with regard to retention of existing and recruitment of new staff, and we can appreciate why this proved to be a significant factor in the decision-making process. Unfortunately the end result will be a loss of skilled jobs from the rural communities which most need them.Ms Morris added: \u0026ldquoAt a time when the future for the north Highlands is looking bright, with significant investments in oil and gas, renewables, tourism and indeed the airport itself, we feel this is a missed opportunity to maximise these. We will be working closely with Hial, public agencies and local businesses over the coming years to understand and address the impact that this decision will have on the north Highlands.Inverness was picked as the preferred location for a new state-of-the art air traffic control centre following a study by consultants.Thursday 19 Jul 2018 4:36 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116574.jpg","title":"High calibre medical staff recruited in Caithness","story":"\u0026nbspNHS Highland yesterday confirmed the full and part-time appointments, which include two advanced nurse practitioners and a physiotherapist.Bill Fernie, chairman of Caithness Health Action Team, said: \u0026ldquoIt is definitely good news that the posts which were empty for a long time are being filled and that is welcomed by us.\u0026ldquoThis is a success for NHS Highland but it has been a long time coming.

The recruitment of three GPs is particularly remarkable considering a quarter of GP practices across Scotland have vacancies.\u0026ldquoThe recruitment of all the clinicians will improve the continuity of care provided by the practices while introducing access to a specialist primary care physio at the three sites.\u0026ldquoReducing the reliance on temporary locums will enable NHS Highland to save money while improving care.

A review will take place 12 months after the start of the new timetable in order to establish the long term future of the bus service to Gills Bay.Trudy Morris, who chairs the Caithness Transport Forum, said: \u0026ldquoWe are very pleased to see that Stagecoach has listened to the local community and agreed to secure the bus link to Gills Bay for a further 12 months. Not only will this bring benefit to local bus users, who would otherwise be isolated in their communities, but it also has potential to benefit the tourist market, providing services to link with the Gills Bay ferry.However, she is concerned about the review in 12 months time and said: \u0026ldquoWe will be working with Stagecoach and the local community to see what can be done to promote usage of the route, and will also be discussing with public sector partners such as Highland Council to see what might be done to secure the route on a non-commercial basis in future.Bill Mowat, the chairman of Gills Harbour Ltd, claimed public pressure had an impact on Stagecoach and pointed out there was strong opposition to the plan.Thursday 19 Jul 2018 4:36 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"July 18, 2018 at 8:48 pmAfter several attempts, tugboat on scene of the grounded cargo vessel on the Pentland Skerries have been unable to refloat the ‘Priscilla’ during the high water period.

Last November, Loganair flew Teddy over 200 miles back to Kirkwall for a tearful homecoming with his young owner.Officially launched to mark Teddy Bear Picnic Day, this Tuesday, July 10, the furry keepsakes come with their very own Loganbear luggage tags as well as outfits mirroring the tartan look and feel of the airline’s own uniforms. Throughout the summer months, children will be able to pick between a Logie or Lotti bear once they come onboard a Loganair aircraft, distributed by the airline’s flight crew.The airline is running a number of social media competitions and promotional activity featuring the bears throughout July and August and will also be launching its Instagram channel to showcase the two toys.Kay Ryan, Commercial Director at Loganair said: “We’re very much looking forward to giving some of our youngest passengers a special memory of their trip with Loganair and what better day to unveil the two newest members of our crew than Teddy Bear Picnic day.“Logie and Lotti will be flying with us all summer and our crew can’t wait to introduce them onboard.“Last year the airline did everything it could to reunite a young girl with her lost teddy so this summer we thought we’d try and share some of that joy with children travelling with us.”\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This includes security and airfield operations, airside services, firefighters, operations officers and passenger service agents.“Aberdeen International Airport’s latest derisory pay offer has been emphatically rejected by Unite members,\u0026#8221 said Unite regional officer Wullie Wallace.\u0026#8220The workforce for several years now has received below inflation increases and the company’s idea of rewarding its hard-working employees is by offering more real terms pay cuts.“Aberdeen Airport has been investing heavily into improving the airport facilities and amenities.

This could run into millions of pounds and put at risk the future viability of the business.The company have also met with local Orkney MSP, Liam McArthur, to express their concerns about the delay.As the start of this month, as Mr Matheson stepped into the shoes of the previous minister for transport Humza Yousaf, it was announced that lack of agreement between the Scottish Government and Pentland Ferries had led to no discounted fares being introduced in Pentland Firth ferry routes, by the Government\u0026#8217s self-set deadline of the end of last month.Andrew Banks, Managing Director and Owner of Pentland Ferries said: “We want these passenger subsidies implemented as soon as possible but we need to be 100 per cent sure that the scheme complies with state aid rules.  We have never had any subsidy from the government and even though this scheme gives money to the passenger, not the operator, the minister has told us that we would be liable for any repayment if at a future date the scheme is deemed illegal. This could run into the millions and could finish us off.“We cannot take that risk and we have a responsibility to our staff, our community and family to make sure the scheme works for everyone. We want to work with the Minister and his team to discuss a way forward so that we can all benefit from reduced fares. This scheme will be fantastic for our business, attracting more visitors to the islands and making it cheaper to travel to the mainland for residents. So we want this unlocked as soon as possible. We welcome the Minister’s willingness to gain a full understanding of the detail and very much hope to be able to meet him in Orkney soon.”The minister, Mr Matheson, was asked for a response to the comments from Pentland Ferries and Mr Banks. At the time he replied, Transport Scotland said the invitation had not yet been received so the minister could not comment.However, Mr Matheson did say: “The Scottish Government remains committed to delivering reduced ferry fares to the Northern Isles. I am conscious that there is a great deal of interest in this issue amongst users of the services. As I begin my new role as Transport Secretary, I want to ensure that I gain a full understanding of the detail — it is already very clear to me that planning to introduce reduced fares on the Northern Isles network has been a complex and challenging piece of work.“As a first step, we will cut fares on the Aberdeen-Lerwick and Kirkwall-Lerwick services from June 30. These reductions will be around 20 per cent for both passengers and cars.“On routes to Orkney, it has been necessary to engage with commercial operators on the Pentland Firth. We set out a very fair and reasonable proposal that would maintain competition, enabling them to protect their existing market share. Unfortunately, not all the commercial operators have felt able to agree to our proposals. This means we cannot currently implement reduced fares on any of the routes to and from Orkney without the risk of legal challenge.“This is both disappointing and frustrating, but I am determined to work through the issue to see what more can be done. I have asked Transport Scotland to undertake some further work to see what measures, if any, we can take. As part of that, we are willing to reopen talks with commercial operators.  I will provide a further update to stakeholders and to Parliament as soon as I can, with a view to bringing the full benefits of the scheme to the people of Orkney and Shetland.”\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This will help reduce the initial barrier of connection for a defined period of time.Two events are planned at the St Magnus Centre in Kirkwall, from 6pm to 8pm on Wednesday July 11 then from 10am to 12pm on Thursday July 12 with a further event at the Doubletree by Hilton, Glasgow Central, from 10.30am to 12.30noon on Friday July 13 and finally, a webinar will take place on Tuesday July 17 from 10am to 12pm.Registration is required for the Alternative Approach consultations via the following link: https://www.ssen-transmission/news-views/articles/2018/6/solving-orkney-s-catch-22/Commenting on the Alternative Approach consultation events, Lauren Milligan, commercial policy manager, said: “As a customer-driven initiative, stakeholder engagement has shaped the Alternative Approach proposal to date.“We want to ensure that we develop a solution that not only works for network companies but also the wider industry and other connection customers and would therefore encourage anyone with an interest in our proposed Alternative Approach trial to register for one of our consultation events.”The final stage of consultation is planned to take place in Autumn on the various components of the transmission reinforcement project in advance of submitting planning applications to the relevant planning authorities, the Scottish Government, Marine Scotland and Orkney Islands Council.The progression of the project is subject to all necessary planning consents and securing regulatory approval from industry regulator Ofgem, with the Alternative Approach trial also subject to regulatory approval.For more information on the proposed Orkney transmission reinforcement, including links to both consultation documents, click here.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

What’s more, on still summer evenings it’s really nice to hear the students’ voices echoing across the harbour before we set off to sail.As the Year of Young People progresses throughout 2018 Mr Garrett said that Serco Northlink will be continuing to celebrate this special year with additional partnerships with the local community and its youngest residents.”Leah Hamilton from Stromness Primary School was one of the pupils chosen for the recording, which she found very enjoyable.“It was great fun recording the announcement,\u0026#8221 she said.\u0026#8220It only took us a few attempts and we were pleased with the final message.“We know that safety is important when travelling anywhere so we hope that the new announcement will help NorthLink Ferries’ passengers listen to the briefing and follow the steps carefully.”\u0026nbsp\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

We created the FitHomes concept to help Highland residents take charge of their own wellbeing and health needs through innovative technology and design.\"Thanks to the support we\u0026rsquove had from Centrica, both financially and advisory, we will be able to deliver digital health and assisted living technologies in a way that has not been possible before.\"The investment has been made by Centrica\u0026rsquos Ignite social impact investment fund. Established in 2017, Centrica Innovations aims to invest \u0026pound100 million by 2022 in new technologies that will transform the way people live, work and move.Sam Salisbury, Centrica Innovations labs director, said: \"As a market leader in connected home products, we are always on the lookout for opportunities to solve real world problems with new technology and innovation. The lack of affordable, energy efficient, desirable homes is one that is affecting families across the country so we\u0026rsquore delighted to be able to support an initiative that shows such potential in transforming how people, young and old, live in their homes.\"The origins of the FitHome go back to 2008 when a tenant was found dead in his home, having lain unnoticed for over a year. Vowing to put new preventative systems in place, Albyn commissioned research exploring potential solutions.

It\u0026rsquos not an easy decision.\"We\u0026rsquove listened to customers, colleagues, communities and elected representatives and we continue to do so.\"We\u0026rsquove committed to making no further changes to the size of our branch network in Scotland until at least 2020 \u0026ndash and not to remove or replace, at a suitable nearby location, the branch ATM if there\u0026rsquos no other free-to-use ATM within 1km of the closing branch.\"The way our customers are banking is changing and it is important that we respond to that change. Across Scotland, usage of our branches is down 42 per cent since 2014. Only one per cent of our customers in Scotland visit their branch on a regular weekly basis. Seven in 10 customers are using mobile or online banking.\"\"We recognise that every customer will have different banking needs and we are committed to ensuring all our customers receive the best possible service.\"We\u0026rsquove invested to provide more ways to bank with us now than ever before.\"He added: \"We\u0026rsquove committed to keeping 10 branches open until the end of 2018.\"Johnston Carmichael has been appointed to carry out an independent review into these 10 branches and are meeting with local customers, representatives, employees and stakeholders in all ten communities to understand the impact of each individual closure.\"We have committed to accepting the recommendations of this review in full.\"Thursday 19 Jul 2018 4:37 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Depute fiscal Alison McKenzie told Sheriff Margaret Neilson the 15-year-old was being trained in lifeguard skills and it was when they were alone at the pool Russell repeatedly fondled him over his trunks: \"It happened so frequently he could not recall the number of occasions he was molested,\" said the fiscal.The boy didn\u0026rsquot report the assaults and told no-one until many years later as a father of two he received a letter from Russell offering to act as a football scout for his children.The fiscal said: \"The complainer was furious, recalled the abuse he suffered at the hands of the accused, and made a statement of complaint to police.\"Russell admitted assaulting the boy on various dates between 1977 and 1979 at Dingwall Sports Centre Swimming Pool and between May and June 1981 at the Mackay Hostel sexually assaulting a 16-year-old.He further admitted assaulting an 18-year-old by handling his buttocks over his kilt in 1983 at a street in Dingwall and exposing himself to him.He also pleaded guilty to indecently assaulting an 18- year-old at the hostel in 1984 by sitting on his bed uninvited, placing his hand under the bed covers and repeatedly attempting to touch his genitals.Sentence was deferred after his last appearance for reports.Russell is due to appear in court again on August 2.Thursday 19 Jul 2018 4:37 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

In more recent times, it has seen the fairytale rise of Ross County from Highland League to Premiership \u0026ndash and a notorious Town Hall appearance by the Beatles when the Fab Four were on the brink of global success.Now, history hunters are being targeted by DCDC which has sought to work with the public to create a new vision of the town.Fascinating facts are being assembled by Dingwall History Society for panels dotting the town and shining light on its rich past.Secretary\u0026nbspSandra MacDonald said: \"Dingwall has a very long and significant history and we have the information available.\"The group will gather facts and suggest significant sites worthy of interpretation but will not have the final say.Mrs MacDonald, whose late husband David \"DD\" MacDonald chaired the society for a decade, said: \"There are the obvious sites like the Tollbooth \u0026ndash the tower and the clock.\"Other sites being considered include the war memorials at Station Square and the Hector Macdonald Monument and Moot Hill in the Cromartie Memorial car park, where the Vikings are believed to have held gatherings.Mrs MacDonald added: \"A board can carry a minimum amount of information but can indicate where people can access far more online.\"DCDC secretary Robin Lingard revealed the heritage trail is one of several items being proposed by the group, set up as a charity two years ago to tap funding pots for improvements. He told a recent open meeting that membership had more than doubled. \"We are very pleased,\" he said. \"I think out of it new ideas will come forward.\"Community activist George Murray, project manager for Dingwall Means Business, targeting the establishment of a business improvement district (BID), said: \"I think the DCDC is the perfect body to spearhead and develop plans like the heritage trail. I see it as being beneficial not only for local community development and participation but also as a way of presenting our community heritage to the world, especially as we get busier with the advent of the cruise tour coaches beginning to discover the town and the success of the NC500 route.\"If suitable funding can be put in place a heritage trail round the area could be a real boon to the town.\"Dingwall councillor Angela MacLean said a trail is \"a fantastic opportunity\" to showcase the town.She said: \"Many of the DCDC group\u0026rsquos wish list buildings are in the ownership of the Highland Council and if DCDC or another local group would like to take over and run of any of these buildings I am more than happy to lend my support. I would also like to congratulate DCDC for the work they have done so far and look forward to working with them to make some of their proposals a reality over the coming years.\"\u0026bull What do you think about the idea?

What you’ll need:              • 500g Canadian strong white bread flour (or a flour with a high gluten content, i.e. at least 14 per cent) • 30g lard or vegetable shortening • 10g sugar • 10g salt • 5g fast action yeast             • 400ml cold water For the Coating • 50g plain flour • 50g rice cones/flourView our STEP BY STEP GALLERY HERE            Method: 1 Rub the fat into the flour in a large mixing bowl. Stir in the sugar, salt and yeast. 2 Now pour in the water and mix until it is all incorporated. This is a wet dough but when you are using bread flour with such a high gluten content it can easily take that much water without becoming sloppy. 3 Remove the dough from the bowl and knead it for 1 minute until the dough has just become smooth with all the ingredients thoroughly combined. 4 With such a long ferment you don’t need to knead it too much. Put the dough back into the bowl and cover loosely with cling film. Put the bowl in the refrigerator to leave it to ferment for 12 – 16 hours.             5 The next morning combine the rice cones and plain flour for the coating. Take a large baking sheet and dust it liberally with the coating mixture (make sure to leave enough to coat the rolls). 6 Empty the dough on to a work surface which has been liberally dusted with the rice/flour coating mixture. This is where a large silicone spatula or scraper is useful. 7 Now using a dough scraper divide the dough into 8 pieces. Don’t worry if it is sticky or messy as these rolls aren’t supposed to look perfect. 8 Dust your fingers with the coating mixture and take each piece of dough, one at a time, and dip it into the coating mixture and place it on the baking sheet. They don’t need to be in the shape of a roll but try to keep in the air that is inside the dough. 9 Do this with each piece, placing them near to each other so that when they rise they will bake together. Despite the stickiness of this dough the coating mixture works wonders for stopping the dough from sticking to everything. Leave them to rise for 1 – 2 hours or until doubled in size. 10 Bake in a 250˚C preheated oven on a high shelf for 15 – 20 minutes or until the tops are dark. The rolls should be well fired for the right flavour.• Recipe submitted by Fraser Wright Read more: The history of morning rolls, including a recipe for making your ownRead more: A history of the square sausage, including a recipe for making your own"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4770159.1531902954!/image/image.jpg","title":"manish jethwa glasgow can be the uk s landmark low emission city","story":"Sorry, we\u0027re having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...        The Scottish Government has unveiled plans to work with councils to introduce low-emission zones (LEZs) in Scotland\u0026#8217s four biggest cities by 2020. The objective is clear: to reduce emissions and improve air quality across Scotland.                Glasgow plans to have Scotland’s first LEZ in place by the end of this year and it will eventually result in all but the cleanest-engine vehicles being banned from the city centre. That is one key way in which the city could work towards its key goal of lowering emissions, but what else can the authorities do to achieve not just this core aim but also the wider goal of reducing air pollution?            New technology that connects a range of different infrastructure together potentially has a big role to play. The latest advances in ‘Internet of Things’ (IoT) technology allow cities to connect to street lights, buildings, bridges, drainage systems and other infrastructure to monitor and analyse how they interact. This can form the foundation for local authorities’ development of smart cities or regions with reducing emissions an important part of this.            READ MORE: Fears raised that Scotland’s firs low-emission zone will have little impactLocal authorities across Scotland already have networks of automatic monitoring stations in place to capture relevant data from various points and assess air quality. Sensors can be installed on street lights above the reach of vandals but at a level low enough to measure the air people are breathing.The data collected allows councils to monitor pollution levels and then adjust their strategy around road building, transport planning and pedestrianisation, for example, both to keep emissions to a minimum and reduce the impact they have on the wider public. Power and communication can be delivered through the street infrastructure and the wider smart city network. Linked to this, cities could also look to further cut emissions by reducing the number of traffic hotspots in the areas under their control. That’s essentially about pinpointing where traffic is heaviest. The UK is currently a very congested nation. Back in 2016, analytics company Inrix monitored traffic on every road in 123 cities, including London, Glasgow, Rome and Madrid. Its analysis revealed more than 20,300 so-called “traffic hotspots” in UK cities – well over double the number in Germany and twice that of France.READ MORE: Glasgow’s Internet of Things network expandsKnowing where the main points of congestion are is half the battle. Armed with that knowledge, councils can start to mitigate the problem by introducing new approaches to traffic signalling, for example, or by enhancing communication with other road users through better signposting. Dynamic traffic forecasting is another fast-emerging technology that these Scottish cities could potentially make use of. The approach connects infrastructure assets and devices to improve mobility across cities, thereby helping to reduce the time vehicles are on the road and, by extension, minimise emissions. Sensors at parking spots could collect real-time data on parking availability and be transmitted across networks, linking with end-user and local authority devices. Traffic control cameras could be connected to the transport authority in real time, enabling them to potentially increase the frequency and duration of green lights depending on road conditions.            It’s yet another example of how the smartest Scottish cities can successfully implement low-emission zones and keep pollution levels to a minimum over the coming years by adopting the latest technology solutions to monitor and measure the current situation – and then take action.Manish Jethwa is chief technology officer at Yotta"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4770682.1531933507!/image/image.jpg","title":"priest who called pride offence to god removed as university chaplain","story":"        A Catholic priest who described Glasgow Pride as a \u0026#8220gross offence to God\u0026#8221 has been removed from his role as a university chaplain.

Despite a brave and thrilling attempt, resulting in an 11-point victory, realistically the overall result was never really in doubt.\n The Shetland swimmers, led by triple record-breaker Jasmin Smith, once again defeated their hosts by nearly 20 points.\nSuperiority in the water is now a regular occurrence in inter-counties, and the days when Orkney maintained a stranglehold on that event have been confined to distant memory.\nPart of the reason for the continued success could well be the number of swimming clubs around the isles, with Shetland, Lerwick, Delting, South Mainland, Whalsay and the West Side all competing for honours.\nRegular events in Shetland could be just as important as the trips to the mainland, as it helps to forge the competitive element necessary in the inter-county.\nThe only disciplines in which Orkney were successful this year were hockey and netball, where apart from school tournaments in the latter there is no recognised league structure here.\nHuge credit is due to the swimmers and their coaches, and also the many others who put in so much time and effort at the other sports involved in the Stuart Cup.\nHere’s hoping that the hockey and netball contestants will not have long to wait for their own success.\n: : : : : : : :\nOn the subject of hockey, mention needs to be made of former goalkeeper Sarah Couper who is now a qualified A grade umpire.\nShe travelled away last weekend to take charge of two international matches and is off to Swansea today to umpire a home international masters game.\nThis is the pinnacle of officiating in hockey and should be seen as a fine achievement both Couper and the sport in Shetland, which faces the perennial battle for getting a new playing surface.\n: : : : : : : :\nCongratulations are due to the Lerwick Spurs football team which is now through to the fourth round of the Highland Amateur Cup.\nSpurs defeated Ness from the Western Isles 3-0 at Dornoch on Saturday and now face Caithness side Staxigoe in the last-16 clash.\nIt was the first of two successes against a team with the same name in three days and no hangovers were obvious as they returned and picked up an important victory over Ness United in the local premier league on Monday.\nThe other Ness may not mean much to the average Shetland football follower, but some may know it was the club that Angus Murray represented for a long time.\nMurray, who played for Lerwick Thistle for a couple of seasons in the mid-1980s while working at the town’s Co-op, commented on Facebook this week that it was the “wrong half of Lerwick but well done Spurs”.\nHe continued: “The competition is in the doldrums and in need of new talent. It would be quite something if a Shetland team could win it given the logistics. I’ll be watching with interest.”\nPressed on his Shetland connections, Murray went on: “The Spurs of my era were formidable \u0026#8230 Watt Bros, Leask Bros, B Williamson, K Malcolmson et al. I must say I had not heard of Jim Peterson’s passing. A scholar, gentleman and Spurs stalwart, we had many a chat in the Lounge Bar.\n“How removed we are at times. He wrote the The History of Shetland Football 1887-1987, a copy of which I have, one of his many accomplishments I’m sure. All the best in the next games. The competition does islands no favours on balance.”\nMurray, much like the way he used to play, is bang on target here. The tournament organisers do little to help the furthest travelled teams, and Jim Peterson is indeed a massive loss.\nWith the anniversary of the Milne Cup now under two months away, and a competition running (see above) to name Shetland’s greatest team, Murray’s name may be on the minds of a few selectors.\nAnd we could hope that Peterson, although this column is not normally the place for religious connotations, may be looking down and having a dram when the big event happens on 28th July.\n: : : : : : : :\nProfessional footballers, especially in the modern era, obviously have a lot of time on their hands.\nThat could explain why they indulge so much in the absurd tattoos and haircuts which are now commonplace.\nThe latest to make the news is Manchester City’s Raheem Sterling, who has gone and had the image of an AK-47 assault rifle inked on his lower leg.\nSterling, rather bafflingly, claimed the idea was a tribute to his father who was gunned down by a gang in Jamaica when he was just a toddler.\nNot surprisingly Sterling has been criticised by anti-gun campaigners, who demanded he remove the tattoo or be dropped from the England squad.\nRichard Taylor, whose 10-year-old son Damilola died after being attacked by a gang in London, has also accused Sterling of setting a terrible example to fans.\nThe player has now explained that he would never touch a gun and that the tattoo is “unfinished”. Maybe he intends to have a deletion mark added on top of the offending image?\nApparently, Gary Lineker of all people has jumped to Sterling’s defence, claiming it is “weird, unpatriotic and sad” for him to be criticised by the media in such a way prior to the World Cup.\nI’m sorry, but it’s not the fault of newspapers that Sterling appears to be lacking in grey cells. I’ve never been a fan of Lineker, but did think he would show more common sense than this.\nTaylor is correct.

They are sitting in a office somewhere in Moscow, but bizarrely kitted out in full referees’ uniform!\nWhy on earth they didn’t disallow Switzerland’s equaliser against Brazil is beyond me, however. Everyone seemed to notice Steven Zuber’s push on his marker before making room for himself to head the ball home.\nEveryone that is except the boys in black in Moscow. The ITV panellists were unanimous in their opinion that the goal should have been ruled out. Even Roy Keane, who used to think decapitation was just about permissable, appeared to agree with the others.\nOkay, so we will mention the commentary and punditry. Apart from Keane and Slaven Bilic – I loved it when he said he couldn’t really care less about whether the Swiss leveller should have been allowed or not – there is really no-one who comes with an opinion which makes you think.\nMost of the time they are prattling on about how far England are likely to go, even when the focus is on an entirely different group. And surely it is high time Gary Lineker was pensioned off. His pathetic attempts at puns, which could have been written by a five-year-old, had their day a long time ago.\nMeanwhile in our office “World Cup Sweepstake”, which requires the entrant to basically predict the results all the way through the competition, things aren’t going too badly. Despite obviously getting the Argentina/Iceland and Germany/Mexico games wrong, plus a few others, I remain in contention on the leaderboard.\nSo what about the last 16?

The cricketer with roots connected to these parts was none other than the man of the match himself – batsman Callum MacLeod whose magnificent 140 not out was largely responsible for Scotland’s thrilling win.\nMacLeod’s father Donald attended the Anderson High School in the late 1960s and early 70s. He was a goalkeeper himself, playing for the Ness United team in the Shetland under-18 competitions.\nHe went on to make somewhat of a name for himself as a photographer, working for The Press and Journal and The Scotsman at times before establishing his own business.\nMacLeod (junior) has obviously usurped any success attained by his old man, however. Even before his recent moment of glory he has been an established international batsman, making several centuries at one-day level.\nHe has been good enough to play grade cricket in Sydney, which is no mean feat, has had stints at English counties Warwickshire and Durham and has just signed a contract with Derbyshire.\nIt is going on half a century since I last saw Donald MacLeod, but I know a certain former Whitedale goalkeeper who keeps in touch. If he happens to read this he’ll maybe pass on congratulations from me, and I’m sure a few others, to the family.\n: : : : : : : :\nTwo weeks ago I suggested that having clubs competing in a local league structure could be of great benefit to preparation for junior inter-county sports such as hockey and netball.\nWhile there is no regular junior league set-up in the isles for hockey, it has been pointed out that in netball this exists for primary school-aged players upwards.\nThe sport appears to be thriving at the various age levels, with under-13 and under-17 squads regularly competing on the mainland with success.\nThe Anderson High School team has also regularly sent a team to compete in the Scottish Schools Open competition, where they have performed with distinction over the past few years.\nThe AHS team also plays in division one of the senior netball leagues, while a feeder team called “Hotfooters” was created to provide easier access for youngsters to join the league.\nAccording to the organisers there have been over 1,000 competitive matches in Shetland and 32 competitive matches away from the isles for juniors this season in various leagues and tournaments.\nCoach Sanna Aitken says: “Of course it is disappointing that we lost the junior inter-county this year \u0026#8230 the girls were really gutted.\n“As a coach, I am delighted that the netball continues to be really competitive [with] an incredibly high standard of match demonstrating the hard work and success of the sport and junior set-up in both isles.\n“I am confident when saying the loss was nothing to do with any weaknesses in the local league structure. It just didn’t go our way on the day. Only two years ago it went Shetland’s way where we won on Orkney’s home turf.

There is no doubt the English are cute enough to take full advantage of the introduction of VAR system with three penalty kicks so far despatched by captain Harry Kane.\nPenalising defenders for holding at corners and other set pieces is, I have to say, a major step forward. This has been going on for far too long in most levels of football, and thankfully the days of pundits uttering the words “part and parcel of the game” will now be over.\nGrabbing someone in a bear hug is not football – never has been and never will be. I recall a European match some years ago when Glasgow Celtic should have had about six penalties but the referee gave none.\nWhat this needs now is for officials to be in accordance with one another. But sadly, and I can envisage a few whistlers spluttering over their cornflakes at this, the words “consistent” and “referees” are an oxymoron as far as I\u0026#8217m concerned.\nOn the subject of the English progression in the tournament, it has once again thrown up the perennial question of whether Scottish people should support their oldest rivals.\nThere are no doubt many north of the border who would find the prospect of England winning the World Cup a terrifying one. They could even be in the majority. A recent poll suggested that only 15 per cent of Scots would support the English while 28 per cent would back anyone playing against them.\nThe same survey found that only two per cent of Scottish National Party voters would get behind England, although I actually find that figure quite high.\nIt does appear to be the case that Scottish football followers have nothing against English players, many of whom they actually admire, but it is those in the press and the media who they reserve their anger for.\nI sincerely hope that England do go all the way. I have always supported them when Scotland are not involved, and in recent years that has become the norm.\nA few issues do bother me, such as the constant gormless look on Kane’s face and the insistence of manager Gareth Southgate on dressing as if he was taking part in the World Snooker Championships. Someone should tell him that waistcoats are the most pointless item of clothing known to man.\nBut hey, most of it is good. I particularly enjoy the ITV panel and even Ian Wright is growing on me!\n: : : : : : : :\nIt is just over a month since the tragic death of former Aberdeen footballer Neale Cooper and I would like to add my own tribute to the many which have been paid to such a popular man.\nThe late Neale Cooper made a memorable trip to Shetland.\nAt just 19 he was the youngest member of the 1983 European Cup Winners Cup side which defeated Real Madrid in the final at Gothenburg in Sweden.\nAlong with that memorable triumph he was in the team which won two Scottish league titles, four Scottish Cups, a league cup and the European Super Cup, all achieved before he was 24.\nHe later played for Aston Villa, Rangers, Reading, Dunfermline and Ross County, where he later became manager.\nIt was in the summer of 1999, when Ross County were invited to Shetland as guests for Scalloway’s centenary celebrations, that I had the privilege of meeting Cooper.\nThere was a gala dinner in the village hall after the friendly match where County defeated Scalloway 8-2, and he agreed to give me time for a short interview. But not until after his speech, he said, which he was dreading as he hated speaking at formal events.\nSadly the evening dragged on somewhat, with various Scalloway luminaries spending rather more time on stage than was really necessary, and it was approaching 1am when Cooper eventually got his turn.\nI decided to give up on the interview that night, and maybe catch him the following day after a game against a Shetland XI in Lerwick.\nAs I was wandering along the embankment at Gilbertson Park prior to the match I heard someone calling my name, and was surprised to see Cooper running towards me.\nHe was full of apologies about the previous evening, although he had no justification, and he said he would speak to me immediately after the game.\nThe match ended 2-2 and Cooper was generous in his praise for the opposition. Shetland were “as good as any top Highland League side”, he said.\nThe two-day visit had been excellent both from a football point of view and a social one, he added. “It’s been fantastic. We had a great welcome from Scalloway and it was an honour to be invited to their centenary celebrations. I’ve never been to Shetland before and I only found out last week that my mother had been here 40 years ago.”\nFollowing Cooper’s untimely death, and the loss of the first of the Gothenburg greats, there have been many kind words. Colleagues, writers and others have pointed out what a humble, friendly and likeable character he was.\nThey are absolutely correct. I’ve meet a few well-known footballers over the years but I have no difficulty in stating that Neil Cooper was the nicest one of them all.\n: : : : : : : :\nCyclist Chris Froome is now free to go for a record-equalling fifth Tour de France win after his anti-doping case was sensibly dropped.\nThe Team Sky rider had been under investigation by the sport’s world governing body Union Cycliste Internationale but proceedings were closed on Monday.\nFroome, who is bidding to move level with Eddy Merckx, Bernard Hinault, Jacques Anquetil and Miguel Indurain as the only five-time winners of the tour, has been under intense pressure since an amount of the asthma treatment salbutamol was found in his system.\nGet off this guy’s back and give him a break, I say. Just because he’s the best cyclist in the world does not mean he’s benefiting from a performance-enhancing drug.\n: : : : : : : :\nWith all the buzz of the World Cup an annual competition in southwest London has almost been forgotten about.\nYes, Wimbledon is in full flow once again and the British competitors are as usual struggling to make it into the second week.\nAndy Murray was probably sensible to withdraw, citing that he was not quite ready for five-set matches after his hip operation. There were signs at Queens and Eastbourne, however, that he may be able to scale the heights once more.\nThere is of course a capable replacement in Kyle Edmund, who is seeded having reached the Australian Open semi-finals earlier this year.\nEdmund’s half of the draw looks fairly open, and he could well still be involved come Monday. But of course anything can happen, and by the time you read this he could be gone.

Any avoidable delay in receiving essential treatment is unacceptable.\n\u0026#8220Many of these passengers have been waiting for their appointments for months if not years, and have no way to access the treatment and specialists they need at home.\n\u0026#8220Travelling out with the isles for medical treatment is already stressful for vulnerable isles residents without the added anxiety caused by cancellations. Rescheduling appointments is not easy for those living in remote communities and patients may have a lengthy wait for another opportunity to travel.\n\u0026#8220The right to strike is an important one and I understand that strikes have to cause disruption in order to be effective.\n\u0026#8220But, I urge your members to carefully consider this compromise: Loganair flights from the North Isles use smaller aircraft which require a lower level of fire service cover.\n\u0026#8220Therefore, Unite members could guarantee a minimum level of fire and security coverage on the proposed strike dates, allowing life-line Orkney and Shetland flights to continue for essential medical travel.\n\u0026#8220I hope further discussions will resolve the dispute before any strike action goes ahead and that the needs of North Isles passengers are at the forefront of your decision making.\u0026#8221\nMeanwhile, Loganair is giving passengers in Shetland the chance to change their flights.\nAbout 170 members, including key airport staff, security workers and firefighters have voted in favour of striking – with more talks expected next week involving conciliation service Acas.\nTwenty-four-hour strikes are planned for Friday 20th July as well as on Thursday 2nd August and Thursday16th August.\nLoganair managing director Jonathan Hinkles said passengers could change their flights free of charge.\nHe said: “Although there is still time for the strike to be averted and we hope it will be, we are offering customers booked to fly to or from Aberdeen on the strike dates the opportunity to change their travel date or route if they wish.\n\u0026#8220This is free of charge and designed to offer certainty of alternatives for those booked to travel.\n\u0026#8220We also have contingency plans to operate Aberdeen flights to alternate airports on strike days if this does go ahead, and will announce details of those if this action cannot be averted. Our website is up to date with the latest information.”\nUnite regional officer Wullie Wallace expected talks with Acas next week. The dispute is over pay for airport workers. A total of 88 per cent of workers rejected the latest pay offer.\nThe union said members had rejected two below-inflation wage offers on the back of below inflation increases over the last two years.\nMr Wallace said: \u0026#8220Aberdeen International Airport’s latest derisory pay offer has been emphatically rejected by Unite members. The workforce for several years now has received below inflation increases and the company’s idea of rewarding its hard working employees is by offering more real terms pay cuts.\n\u0026#8220Aberdeen Airport has been investing heavily into improving the airport facilities and amenities. It’s high time for the company to invest in its employees. Unite remains open to further discussions with a view to resolving the dispute.\u0026#8221\nAn unattributed quote from an Aberdeen spokesman stated: \u0026#8220We have been informed by Unite of their intention to take industrial action on Friday 20th July.\n\u0026#8220This follows the rejection of our proposed pay offer. We believe we have made an offer that is entirely fair and reasonable and we are committed to continuing discussions to reach a resolution acceptable to all parties.\n\u0026#8220We have made contact with Acas which has agreed to mediate between both parties. We are seeking a suitable date to continue our discussions in an attempt to reach a mutually agreeable position.\n\u0026#8220We will, as a matter of course, ensure contingency plans are in place in the event of any planned industrial action.”\nI am amazed that the Scottish Government will allow a union to hold hostage urgent healthcare for 45,000 citizens in Shetland and Orkney. It is reasonable to suspect that the SNP is in the unions’ pockets.\nI can only suggest that if Christopher wants to find out who is in the ‘unions pockets’ he should investigate the connection between the Labour Party and Unite,  and while he’s at it perhaps he should refresh his memory as to what powers are reserved at Westminster and which are devolved to Holyrood.\nThere are so many reds under beds these days \u0026#8230\n My primary concern is that Shetland and Orkney folk will be at risk for a number of August days while this irresponsible union strikes.

Alley.\nScott Duncan (24), a former Kingussie High School pupil, has just returned from his dream adventure to the United States with a team of fellow meteorologists.\nHe got up close and personal with several tornadoes and massive electric storms during the trip of a lifetime which started on May 19, with the quartet returning on Saturday.\nThe daredevil and talented photographer captured breathtaking snaps of the huge storms as they crossed Nebraska, Kansas, Colorado and Texas.\nScott told the Strathy: \"The four of us flew out to Tornado Valley in the hope to witness some of the planet\u0027s most extreme weather.\n\"We decided to put our meteorological skills together and chase the storms ourselves.\"\nThe group of Reading University graduates rented a car and travelled 7000 miles over the course of the three weeks.\n\"We do it for the buzz as we all have a passion for extreme weather and it is also a great way to hit the open road and explore new states,\" he added.\nHe agreed that it can be a dangerous hobby but not for the reasons you would think.\n\"People often think tornadoes are the main concern but lightning, giant hail stones and flash flooding are often the hazards that prove most deadly,\" he said.\n\"Careful planning before and during a storm chase is absolutely essential.\"\n\u0026nbsp\nScott now works for MetDesk, a UK-wide weather service, and he took those skills across the Pond with him.\nThe friends used the latest weather model data, satellite and radar observations and invested in a portable internet device to ensure they had the best chance of remaining connected to signal while on the move.\nScott said it is incredibly important that the driver can access accurate directions quickly when faced with dangerous and often changing conditions.\nAlthough they had a few close calls, they managed to avoid getting themselves into \"major trouble\" by knowing when to back off and take shelter.\nThe Newtonmore man explained: \"We avoided driving through storms with tennis ball sized hail stones and 70mph straight line winds.\n\"But at one point we did have to take shelter in a gas station freezer room \u0026ndash the strongest room in the building \u0026ndash due to a tornado with confirmed flying debris just upwind of us.\"\nScott admitted that storm chasing is not for the faint-hearted but that \"it is an experience\" and in the US it is becoming an increasingly popular attraction.\nBecause the adventurers did not know where they would end up at the end of the day, accommodation had to often be found late and in an obscure towns in the middle of nowhere\nScott, who is now safely back in Hertfordshire where the weather is rather less dramatic, added: \"That alone makes the trip more exciting as it holds an incredible depth of freedom.\"\nTornado Alley is the name of the area in the United States where tornadoes are most frequent.\nThe term was coined in 1952 as the title of a research project to study severe weather in areas of Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, South Dakota, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Nebraska, Colorado, North Dakota, and Minnesota.\nThursday 19 Jul 2018 4:37

Sabhal Mòr Ostaig principal Prof Boyd Robertson said, \u0026#8220This is a richly-deserved honour for Duncan which recognises the hugely important contribution he has made to the development of the college over many years and the vital contribution he has made to the development of the Gaelic language and culture and to the advancement of Gaelic and Gaelic-medium education, both as a teacher and as a former HM Inspector.”\n“Duncan\u0026#8217s critical input to Sabhal Mòr Ostaig’s development in its challenging formative years was marked by his steady stewardship, as a former chairman and his pioneering work, alongside that of his fellow trustees, demonstrated an exemplary vision and commitment without which what is now the National Centre for the Gaelic Language and Culture would not have existed.”\n“For that, all who have benefited from this wonderful and inspiring place, over the intervening years, owe him a great debt of gratitude and it is for that reason we celebrate with him here today.

The change came when my grandmother remarried, and so then the family name became Davis.”\nFor 37 years “MacKenzie country” has been his base, and these days it’s fishing rather than football which is his passion. Yet before making the move north with wife Vi to build the Craigmore Hotel in Gairloch, Harry Davis had enjoyed a remarkable sporting life — recovering from multiple bullet wounds in the Korean War to carve out a glittering football career with Rangers.\nTalk about “dual contracts” may have loomed large over Scottish football in recent months, but here was one ex-professional who really knew what it was like to serve two paymasters.\nA native Fifer, but brought up in Perth, Harry was an emerging talent with East Fife when he signed up as part of his national service to join the Black Watch. He soon found himself in the thick of the bloody, but often forgotten, Korean War where in the midst of conflict he suffered injuries from which it would take him over two years to recover.\nRemarkably, not only did he return to full health, he resumed his football career with gusto — signing for Rangers in 1956. He would enjoy a memorable eight-year spell with the Ibrox club, winning three league titles, two league cups and a Scottish Cup, as well as playing in the first Scottish side to reach a European final.\nA fearsome defender known as the “Iron Man”, he was never one to shirk a tackle on the pitch, and he’s not afraid to offer an opinion off it either — as he documents in a compelling autobiography which recently hit the bookshelves.\nHis is a tale far removed from the anodyne offerings served up by today’s breed of pampered millionaires. Having witnessed and experienced what he did on the battlefield, it’s hardly surprising that Davis had little time for those less appreciative of their sporting talents.\nTake, for example, the Rangers and Scotland great Jim Baxter.\n“I don’t dispute Baxter’s talent — he was a class player, but he wasted it,” he says ruefully. “He got privileges no one else got and it upset a lot of players in the team. He only turned it on once every three games and for the rest of the time, when your backs were to the wall, Baxter was nowhere to be seen.”\nHe describes Willie Waddell, the man who led Rangers to their only European trophy, as a “lucky manager” who had used his position as a sportswriter to undermine predecessor David White — a man Harry Davis had returned to Ibrox to assist.\n\nIT SEEMS CLEAR that wartime experience — and the discipline and work ethic it instilled — would leave a lasting imprint on everything Harry Davis did thereafter. But, ironically, his prowess on the football field might actually have spared him from active service altogether.\nHis military call came just after he had broken into East Fife’s excellent post-war team under Scott Symon — the man who would later bring him to Ibrox. And he adds: “I had a couple of opportunities, one to be a PTI in the army, and the other to take an airborne course.\n“It was all a scam to get you to play in the army team and I turned them all down. I was quite happy to go and thought it was all a bit of an adventure.”\nThat sense of wide-eyed wonder would soon give way to the full-blooded horrors of war, as he found himself fighting off Chinese forces intent on advancing further south on the Korean peninsula.\nHe remembers that many caught in the thick of the fighting were simple conscripts — scarcely prepared for the brutality they would encounter. Indelibly marked in his memory is the image of one desperate soldier running deliberately into enemy fire and to his death.\n“He was away with the birds,” he added. “I tried to stop him, but just at that moment a shell landed on top of our trench — all the hairs on the back of my hand were singed, but we were sheltered and escaped the full impact. But by the time I got up he was off again, and disappeared.\n“I couldn’t do anything about it, but that stayed with me. You can’t blame the guy — he was just a conscript as well.\n“There was always a little bit of ill feeling in that these conscripts were shipped out to the battlefield, yet regular, more experienced soldiers from the Black Watch were left behind in Germany.”\nHarry’s contribution to the war effort ended in the spring of 1953, though to this day he has no idea where the bullets which left him wounded actually came from. Years later, a former colleague contacted him to say he believed he had been responsible.\n“I said to him it might have been him, it might not have been. Who knows? But everyone was in a state of panic, and again we go back to conscripts. I certainly wouldn’t place any blame on him.”\nThe stray bullets had caught him on the back of the foot — fracturing his heel, but mercifully just missing the Achilles tendon. Having also suffered abdominal damage, Harry Davis would spend months recuperating in a Japanese hospital before returning to the UK to continue a slow road to recovery.\nIn the far east a nursing sister from Stornoway would become something of an inspiration, but it is Harry’s biggest regret that on leaving Japan he would never see the woman again.\n“She was marvellous and encouraged me so much through all the operations, the bad nights and bad days,” he added. “I made a point that I would go and see her, and when I built the hotel up here I thought I’d be able to find her. I only knew her as Sister MacKenzie, but she was from Stornoway and I believe she had something to do with the Post Office over there.\n“But then I did hear from one source that she had died — I never got to make contact with her. It’s one of the great disappointments of my lifetime.”\nON HARRY’S RETURN HOME doctors gave him little hope of ever playing top-level football again — sometimes in fairly graphic terms.\n“One doctor at the military hospital in London told me that my only hope was that my bowels were in such a state, defenders were likely to slip on what would come out! It didn’t look very encouraging.”\nYet after being helped back to fitness by David Kinnear — a physiotherapist and former Ibrox player — Harry Davis would eventually get his career back on track.\nHe resumed action for East Fife, and in 1956 got the call from Symon to follow him to Ibrox.\nIn Glasgow, he initially learned the ropes in the reserve side — one of his memorable early encounters bringing him into direct contact with the Celtic legend Charlie Tully, who by this time was at the opposite stage of his career.\nBefore too long Davis would join a first-team pool that included vintage names likes George Young, George Niven, Sammy Baird and Alex Scott, and Rangers lifted the league at the end of his first full season in 1957.\nIn something of a golden era for the Scottish game, Davis regularly played in front of crowds topping the 100,000 mark, and he remembers a vibrant and competitive league where in his first few years the main challenge came from a Hearts team which claimed two league titles.\n“If we had fewer than 40,000 at a game it was a disaster,” he said. “But regularly the crowds were 60-70,000 and for big games the 100,000-mark wasn’t unusual.”\nA degree of European success followed, as Rangers reached the European Cup Winners Cup Final in 1961. There they would be outclassed by a fine Fiorentina side, and tellingly Harry feels the Scots simply refused to heed their continental lesson. Half a century on, and the same basic mistakes continue to be made.\n“They were ahead of us,” he said. “Scott Symon was a great manager, no question, but he didn’t keep up with modern techniques. He still said get the ball to the winger, get the winger up the field and cross it and get the centre forward to head it into the net. That worked in the old days, but it didn’t work when you played these continental teams.”\nAfter winding down his playing career with a season at Partick Thistle, Harry took the manager’s job at the grand old institution of Queens Park. It was a time he enjoyed immensely, though the lure of Ibrox once again tempted him back across the city — this time to hook up with White.\nThat spell in the dugout was to prove less successful than his playing days, with Rangers then in the shadow of Jock Stein’s great Celtic side. Yet some redemption would arrive at Dundee where White and Davis led the Dens Park club to a memorable league cup final triumph over Celtic in 1973. A few months later the pair gained revenge over their old nemesis Waddell, dumping Rangers out of the Scottish Cup at Ibrox.\nDundee would prove to be Harry’s last staging post in football — and thereafter he set his sights on the quiet life in the north west Highlands.\nTHESE DAYS his football involvement is limited to appearing alongside former team-mates at charity fundraisers for the Erskine Trust, for which he is also to donate most of the proceeds from his book. However, he still keeps one eye on developments at Ibrox, even if he struggles to comprehend the team’s recent high-profile fall from grace.\n“The honest answer is that I just don’t know what to make of it all,” he said. “One conclusion is reached one week, and a week later it’s turned around again. But I do believe a number of teams were quite happy to get rid of them because they were strong competition. I don’t think that was right.”\nAsked for his personal highlights in the game, his answer is a simple one.  He just reels off a list of the players he played with, and it reads like a who’s who of greats for fans of the Ibrox club.\n“I joined Rangers and played with George Young, George Niven, Baird, Billy Simpson, Bobby Shearer, Alex Scott, Jim McColl — a great team. And then by the end I had also played with John Greig, Ronnie MacKinnon, Ian MacMillan, Millar, Brand, Baxter and Wilson. How many people can say that?”\nA Scotland cap may have proved elusive — “in those days they only picked 11” — with a place on the reserve list as close as he got to pulling on the dark blue.\nNevertheless, Harry Davis had long since proved his mettle on the international stage — and he still has the scars to prove it.\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/7s.jpg","title":"comhairle must replace barra housing","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\nComhairle nan Eilean Siar must replace land they gave away for housing in Castlebay, Barra, because it was meant to be kept in perpetuity for recreational use.\nLast month, Housing Minister Kevin Stewart cut the turf on the Corran Ciosmul development at Horve.

Having beaten Juniors twice already this season \u0026#8211 2-5 and 0-6 \u0026#8211 Jamie MacGregor will have faith that his team can make it a hat-trick of success and book their place in the final.\nIn their last semi-final outing, Mallaig defeated Sleat and Strath 10-8 in an incredible game to secure their place in the GF MacRae Cup Final. The blues, however, will be keen to avoid a repeat of their performance in the final which saw Kyleakin run out 4-1 winners in a disappointing and underwhelming showing by Mallaig.\n\n \u0026#8220Another tough game for us, but it’s the type of games we wanted to be involved in at the start of the season. We now have a great opportunity to make a second cup final this season.\n\u0026#8220The season, in general, has been a learning experience but a very enjoyable one. The lads have picked up a lot quite quickly and we have had some good wins this season especially on our travels. It’s good to be back playing at home especially in such a big game, especially after being away for so long\n\u0026nbsp\nWith four wins from their last five matches in all competitions, and 37 goals scored in the process, Juniors have really hit their stride and will approach their third meeting with Mallaig with great confidence.\nNow just four points point off leaders Sleat and Strath with one game in hand, Phil McCaherty will hope his team can transmit their impressive league form into today\u0026#8217s cup match against the only side who have beaten them domestically this season.\nWhile Juniors\u0026#8217 recent free-scoring display will have given Mallaig some food for thought in their preparations for the match, the Portree side must avoid the lapses in concentration which cost them in their heavy defeats at home against Mallaig in the league and Loch Ness in the Highland Amateur Cup.\n\nIt\u0026#8217s a tough task for us away to Mallaig who have beaten us twice already 5-2 and 6-0. We are going with the same squad (minus Angie MacPherson and Paul MacKinnon) that played GA United in last round, with Nick Flanagan added for goalkeeping duties to free up backup goalie Will Brown to his normal defensive duties. I am hoping that David Potter doesn\u0026#8217t get lost this week!\u0026#8221\n\nIt\u0026#8217s been a fantastic season so far for the Broadford-based side who are the current league leaders, joint top scorers, and have the meanest defence to boot.\nWith an average of 5.2 goals a game in the league, Sleat and Strath have developed a ruthlessness in front of goal and appeared to have a strong belief when they take to the pitch that they can beat any team whether it be at home or away. Their most recent win in which they turned a 3-0 lead at half-time into an emphatic 12-0 victory in last week\u0026#8217s quarter-final tie against much-improved Glenelg is evidence they have the weapons to transform a tight match into a comfortable victory.\nHaving put in impressive defensive displays against both Kyleakin and Portree Juniors in the league, DL MacKinnon\u0026#8217s team have proven they can stand firm when required against tough opponents. That said, he will still be mindful of his side\u0026#8217s loss in their last semi-final encounter against Mallaig \u0026#8211 in what has been their only defeat so far this season \u0026#8211  and will be keen to avoid missing out on a second final.\n\n \u0026#8220It\u0026#8217s going to be a battle at our tight pitch. Key to the result will be our ability to defend set plays, which is not our strong point as we are a very small team. If we can keep Gordy (Mccarroll) and Innis (Thompson) quiet we will hopefully cause them problems with our pace.\u0026#8221\n\u0026nbsp\nWith Sleat and Strath having burst out of the blocks in the league and new boys Mallaig also making their mark, it is perhaps easy to overlook the fact that Kyleakin is not only very much in contention for the league title but have already won a piece of silverware this season with a convincing victory over Mallaig in the GF MacRae Cup.\nWith 22 goals in their last three matches, which included their 10-2 quarter-final win over Kyle, the reigning league champions know how to win games, and ultimately trophies. As well as being well-deserved, their 4-1 victory in the GF MacRae Cup Final against Mallaig was a superb example of game-management against difficult opponents on a big occasion.\nAlthough Kyleakin have put themselves in a good position to challenge on all fronts, they will have to address their inconsistency this season which has seen them held to draws recently by Glenelg and GA United.\nWith back-to-back matches coming up against Sleat and Strath in the cup, then the league, the reigning champions will look to draw on their past successes in the big games.\nBy Adam Gordon\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27408  ","story":" Michael McMonagle\n\nFormer Louth TD and republican ex-prisoner Paddy Agnew was in Leinster House for the first time today, 37 years after being elected. \nPaddy Agnew was one of three republican prisoners elected during the 1981 hunger strikes while imprisoned in Long Kesh and taking part in the blanker protest. \nHe was elected in the 1981 general election, topping the poll in the Louth constituency.

So too should the Irishlanguage, Gaelic culture and Irish identity.\nThe Good Friday Agreement was not about winners and losers.\nThe principles of mutual respect, parity of esteem and equality belong to allsides.\nThe politics of fear and division must be rejected.\nWe need a real and meaningful discussion about how we can share a vision forthe future and build towards reconciliation.\nA good start would be to start a genuine dialogue between Sinn Féin and OrangeOrder.\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27418  ","story":" Michael McMonagle\n\n“Tonight’s rally is an opportunity for the people of Belfast to come out to show solidarity with the families of Gerry Adams and Bobby Storey and the people of the Bogside in Derry and send a message to those involved in attacks on Republicans and on the community to stop immediately. - Pat Sheehan\nA solidarity rally will be held in Belfast this evening following the attacks on the homes of Gerry Adams and Bobby Storey. \nThe rally will take place at the site of the former Andersonstown barracks and will be addressed by Sinn Féin President Mary Lou McDonald. \nGerry Adams and Bobby Storey are also expected to attend tonight\u0027s demonstration. \nThe homes of both men were attacked in the early hours of Saturday morning when explosive devices were thrown. \nCCTV footage from the scene of the attack on Gerry Adams\u0027 home shows that a device was thrown from a passing car. \nAs well as to show solidarity with the two leading republicans and their families, this evening\u0027s rally has also been organised as a further show of solidarity with the people of Derry\u0027s Bogside following six nights of disturbances in the area last week. \nWest Belfast Sinn Féin MLA Pat Sheehan encouraged as many people as possible to attend tonight\u0027s demonstration in order to send a message to those behind the attacks. \n“The attacks involving explosive devices on the homes of Gerry Adams and Bobby Storey were cowardly and reprehensible.\n“Those involved are opposed to the peace process and the process of change.\n“Sinn Féin will continue to represent this community and pursue our agenda for change, for peace and for a new agreed and united Ireland.\n“Tonight’s rally is an opportunity for the people of Belfast to come out to show solidarity with the families of Gerry Adams and Bobby Storey and the people of the Bogside in Derry and send a message to those involved in attacks on Republicans and on the community to stop immediately,\" he said. \nThe rally will be held tonight at 7pm. \n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27419  ","story":" Michael McMonagle\n\nAttacks on republican leaders, attacks on neighbours and communities, wherever they happen, are attacks on society as a whole and society understands that. - Mary Lou McDonald\nThose responsible for the bomb attacks on the homes of Gerry Adams and Bobby Storey, and the recent disturbances in Derry, have no \"plan, strategy or vision for the future,\" Sinn Féin President Mary Lou McDonald has said. \nThe Sinn Féin leader made the remarks ahead of a rally in Belfast tonight to show solidarity with Gerry Adams and Bobby Storey whose homes were attacks with explosive devices at the weekend. \nSpeaking to the media in Belfast alongside Sinn Féin vice President Michelle O\u0027Neill and West Belfast MLA Pat Sheehan, the Sinn Féin president encouraged people to attend tonight\u0027s rally in Andersonstown. \nMary Lou McDonald said Sinn Féin would not be intimidated by such attacks and added that communities will not be bullied by those intent on causing violence and disruption. \n“There is no appetite, no excuse and no purpose behind the violence that occurred,\" she said. \n\"Attacks on republican leaders, attacks on neighbours and communities, wherever they happen, are attacks on society as a whole and society understands that,\" the Dublin Central TD added. \nThe Sinn Féin President said that those intent on violence have nothing to offer society. \n“Michelle and I were in Derry on Friday, we spoke to the people in the Bogside - they made it very clear how angry they are at a very small element that has brought hardship and trouble and panic in some cases to elderly residents and I know here in Belfast there is widespread anger.\n“There is zero tolerance for any element that would set out to cause harm or to cause disruption.\n“Those intent on this disruption have no political plan, have no political strategy, have no vision for the future.

A recent change to the law means that an MP who receives a suspension of more than 10 days must face a by-election if 10% of the voters in their constituency sign a petition asking for that.\n\nAlthough Mr Paisley has a huge majority in North Antrim, the 10% figure could easily be reached if many of those who voted against him in the last election chose to sign such a petition.\n\nThe Commons’ standards commissioner, Kathryn Stone – whose report into the matter went to the committee, which endorsed her findings – ruled that the DUP MP had received a “very substantial personal benefit” from the Government of Sri Lanka in the form of luxury holidays which were first revealed last year by The Daily .\n\nHe did not declare the visits – and then went on to lobby the Prime Minister on behalf of Sri Lanka’s controversial government.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nIn a report published this morning, the commissioner said: “These two visits to Sri Lanka provided a very substantial personal benefit to Mr Paisley and his family. “I find it surprising that such an experienced MP did not ask himself whether it was proper to accept such benefits from a foreign government. \n\n“I also find it surprising that he did not realise that, if accepted, these benefits would call into question his impartiality when he next spoke about the affairs of that government.\n\nThe commissioner found that Mr Paisley had “breached the House’s rule on paid advocacy by writing to the Prime Minister on 19 March 2014 asking for an exclusive benefit for Sri Lanka, having received personal benefit and hospitality from that government within the previous twelve months”.\n\nShe also found that he had “breached the House’s rules on declaration by failing to declare the personal benefit and hospitality from the Sri Lankan government in his letter to the Prime Minister of 19 March 2014”.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nAnd, in a third finding against the veteran DUP figure, she found he “breached the House’s rules on registration of interests by failing to register within the 28 days agreed by the House the two visits made to Sri Lanka with family members in March/April 2013 and in July 2013”.\n\nThe Commons’ Standards Committee has now recommended that Mr Paisley be suspended from the Commons for 30 sitting days “in view of the seriousness of this matter”, with the suspension to start on 4 September.\n\nThe suspension will have to be endorsed by a vote in the House of Commons.\n\nMr Paisley responded to the report via a statement from his lawyer, Paul Tweed, and he hinted at the matter coming before the Commons tomorrow. Mr Tweed also said Mr Paisley was “considering” unspecified legal action against The Daily , over the way in which it broke the story last year.\n\nMr Tweed said: “My client has apologised unreservedly at the outset for his unintentional failure to register the hospitality he received.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“While accepting the decision of the House Standards Committee, he nonetheless continues to take issue with the sensationalised report in the Daily . Legal proceedings are being considered.\n\n“No further comment will be made until Mr Paisley has addressed the House on Thursday.”\n\nIn a letter to the commissioner during her investigation, Mr Paisley said: “I certainly refute any claims that I made an intentional decision not to register, that it was a secret that I was in Sri Lanka, or, worse, that it impacted any comments or decisions I made then or now as a Parliamentarian. None of those claims can in any way be substantiated”.\n\nBut, drawing attention to Mr Paisley’s political experience and the fact he had registered other trips the commissioner said he “must have been aware that there are particular sensitivities about accepting gifts and hospitality from foreign governments”.\n\nShe added: “It is difficult, therefore, to avoid the conclusion that the reason why the third visit was registered and the two earlier ones were not, was that Mr Paisley was conscious of the potential embarrassment that would be caused to him were it to become publicly known that he had accepted very expensive hospitality, for himself and his family, from a foreign government accused of serious human rights violations.”\n\nShe also put it to Mr Paisley in writing during her investigation that he had written to the Prime Minister “urging the government to change its position on a UN motion to the benefit of Sri Lanka. You had received financial benefits from the Sri Lankan government in the previous 12 months. That was a breach of the rule against paid advocacy”.\n\nThe full report is online here: https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201719/cmselect/cmstandards/1397/1397.pdf\n            \n    \n    try { _402_Show() } catch(e) {}    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.ballymenatimes.com/webimage/1.8569604.1531812554!/image/image.jpg","title":"louise dunlop my boys have shown me devoted love","story":"\nGrief-stricken Louise Dunlop says her sons, Michael and Daniel, have been a tower of strength following the tragic death of her eldest boy William at the Skerries 100 road races.\n\n                \nThe 32-year-old sadly lost his life during practice for the event near Dublin on Saturday, July 7.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nWilliam Dunlop is all smiles after finishing on the rostrum in third place in the second Supersport 600 race at the Ulster Grand Prix in 2010.\n      \t\n         \n\n\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nLouise lost her husband, Robert, ten years ago following a fatal accident at the North West 200 and has now also endured the heartbreak of burying a son.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nShe has faced untold anguish, yet at a time of great sorrow, Louise was eager to express her gratitude to those who were on hand to offer her family support and comfort last week, as William was laid to rest alongside his father and uncle Joey at Garryduff Presbyterian Church near Ballymoney.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nThousands turned out to pay their respects to the unassuming racer, who was one of the most popular riders in the paddock.\n\nHe leaves behind his partner, Janine Brolly, who is expecting their second child in September.
