This has given it the confidence to pay a final idend of 10p a share on 6 September, the first payout to shareholders since January 2020. It will set out a new idend policy when it publishes its full-year results on 20 May, the company said. Since floating on the stock exchange in October 2013, Royal Mail had been struggling with its traditional letters business, which is in decline. Attempts to restructure the company led to prolonged battles with unions. However, it has focused on expanding its parcel delivery business, as online shopping soared during the Covid-19 crisis, when many shops have been forced to shut during lockdowns. Richard Hunter, the head of markets at the trading platform Interactive Investor, said: “The astonishing reversal of fortunes at Royal Mail continues as the momentum of bumper Christmas trading has spilled over into the new year. “Challenges remain, however, and the group will need to be alert. Competition is particularly fierce in the parcels business and it is not yet clear whether the current volumes are at a temporary peak as customers have been driven to online shopping from their homes during the pandemic.” As well as investing in its UK Parcelforce ision, Royal Mail sees growth opportunities abroad. Its GLS international parcels arm is expected to make an operating profit of €390m (£350m) for the past year it is forecast to rise to €500m by 2025. Hargreaves Lansdown analyst Nicholas Hyett described GLS as “the jewel in Royal Mail’s crown”. He said: “If the UK business could emulate its international cousin the group would be home and dry. Instead the UK is suffering after a period of chronic underinvestment, and the capital expenditure needed to make up the shortfall looks set to eat into shareholder returns for years to come.” The company recently started trialling a Sunday parcel delivery service for several big UK retailers. Rivals DPD and Hermes already make Sunday deliveries for retailers such as Amazon."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/60c9f71d5cc14e0e2bd6a0362581f7b89bf26e04/0_52_1300_780/master/1300.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=42561edd24d267ab392505be064b4c57","title":"uk economy gdp 2020 house prices lloyds deliveroo markets ftse gold business live","story":"By my rough calculation, that values Deliveroo around £5.85bn, down from the £7.6bn market capitalisation set in the IPO.  A poor start to the biggest float in London in almost a decade. The sight of investors shunning Deliveroo should force the company to rethink how it treats its workers, says UK unions chief Frances O’Grady. O’Grady, general secretary of the TUC, says:  Several major City investors, including Aberdeen Standard, Aviva Investors, BMO Global, CCLA, and Legal \u0026amp General all indicated they were shunning the IPO. Phil Webster, a portfolio manager at BMO, which is one of the largest banks in North America, pointed to the treatment of Deliveroo couriers. Webster said labour issues represented a “ticking bomb on the side” for Deliveroo, which contributed to making it “uninvestable”.  As if ‘Deliveroops’ wasn’t bad enough, AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould says: Mould agrees that the concerns of several major investors over Deliveroo’s working conditions was a blow to the float. Also... the appetite for fast-growing, but currently unprofitable, tech companies has fallen in recent weeks, as investors have anticipated an end to the pandemic, Mould adds: Here’s the FT’s early take: That’s because the company would find it harder to reach profitability if it was forced to guarantee more benefits to its couriers. Uber, for example, has recently guaranteed minimum wage, holiday pay and pensions, following a supreme court ruling against it. And pressure is growing on gig economy companies - 40 major legal challenges have been filed around the world as delivery drivers and riders try to obtain basic employment rights such as minimum wages and sick pay. Also... investors must wonder whether demand for takeaways will hold up once the Covid-19 lockdowns are over, Lund-Yates adds: He blames several factors -- including the City’s wariness of the ‘dual-class’ share structure which gave founder Will Shu more power than other shareholders. Plus, many large investors had concerns over Deliveroo’s working practices and governance. Negative stories about Deliveroo in recent days have also dampened demand (one survey found a third of the riders received less than the legal minimum hourly wage for over-25s) But ultimately, the firm was overpriced at £7.6bn, or 390p per share, Wilson explains: That including some of its most loyal users, who got priority on the £50m of shares for UK-based customers with a Deliveroo account. Shares in Deliveroo opened at 331p, down from the 390p which investors paid for the company in its initial public offering -- the biggest in almost a decade. And they’re continuing to slide, falling as low as 271p at one stage. They’re currently changing hands at around 310p each.  Deliveroo had already been forced to price the IPO at the bottom end of its range, to get the offering away. Several major City investors had resisted the chance to take part in Deliveroo’s IPO, including Aviva Investors, which cited a combination of investment risk and social issues. A key concern for some investors was Deliveroo’s employment practices. The food delivery group does not guarantee minimum pay rates, as it argues couriers are independent self-employed contractors not entitled to benefits such as holiday pay and thee national minimum wage.  As we reported last week: Howard Archer of EY Item Club And Samuel Tombs of Pantheon Macroeconomics. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The UK economy grew faster than expected in the second half of last year, as it struggled back from its worst slump in centuries. So the annual picture is largely the same -- the UK has just suffered its worst annual contraction since Britain was gripped by the Great Frost over 300 years ago. Jonathan Athow, ONS’s deputy national statistician for economic statistics, explains: Shares in meal delivery group Deliveroo will start trading among investors today, in London’s biggest stock market float in a decade. But amid concerns over its treatment of riders, and choppy stock markets, Deliveroo will be valued somewhat less than it had hoped. Shares are being sold at £3.90 each, giving a valuation of £7.6bn. That’s a meaty valuation, but around £1bn less than the top-end of expectations set by Deliveroo during the IPO process.  Deliveroo insists it has seen very significant demand from institutional investors - but several major City names are ducking out of the IPO. The fallout from the collapse of Archegos Capital Management continues, with UK and US regulators reportedly examining whether global investment banks breached rules by holding group discussions shortly before launching a fire sale of nearly $20bn worth of assets.  The Securities Exchange Commission is said to have requested further information from major US banks Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo and Morgan Stanley, as well as Japan’s Nomura and Swiss lender Credit Suisse about a meeting with Archegos founder Bill Hwang on Thursday. Those talks were followed by a flurry of heavy sales of stock, in which Nomura and Credit Suisse ended up taking highly significant losses while other brokers escaped more unscathed. Analysts at JPMorgan Chase have estimated that these losses could reach $5bn to $10bn, much more severe than a typical fund unwinding. Investors are also keen to see the monthly US private sector payroll report from ADP, which may give insight into Friday’s non-farm payroll (the main US unemployment report). A strong reading will bolster hopes for a rapid US recovery, which could put further pressure on bond yields.

For Mandira Sarkar, owner of Mandira’s Kitchen, and deluxe doughnut makers Project D, pivoting quickly has become almost as much of an art form as their products. Sarkar’s business, launched in 2016, is based in a converted 16th-century barn outbuilding overlooking the picturesque Silent Pool lake near Guildford, Surrey. With an all-female (“except for one very brave man”) staff of 20, it produces home-style freezer meals – authentic, healthy dishes such as watercress dal and chicken xacuti, plus a range of samosas and biryanis. The business has a catering service, an onsite cafe and shop, and a cookery school. Pre-pandemic, it also offered spice tours for groups keen to learn about Indian flavours, followed by a meal in the cafe. But Mandira’s Kitchen has had to adapt almost every component of its operations. When they had to close their kiosks, the team had to completely rethink their business model. “We initially furloughed our 26 members of staff,” says Poynton. A few weeks later, though, as public demand for baking essentials skyrocketed, they brought them all back – Project D’s access to local farms had put them in a good position to sell eggs, flour and yeast. “We got our gazebo out and we were popping up in village car parks and town square car parks. We had hour-long queues for eggs. Looking back, it was really insane,” Poynton says. Once given council permission to sell doughnuts alongside the other staple essentials, they also started a doughnut delivery service, which has continued to attract high demand. Sarkar, too, remembers panicking “for about two days”, but then she and her team quickly got to work. Farm shops – the main customers of their freezer meals – were themselves struggling, so she began to market to inidual customers instead. Launching a brand new website, Sarkar pushed out the message that their tasty, healthy meals were perfect to have at home, and available at the click of a button. Local orders were soon followed by UK-wide demand. Sarkar kept innovating. First she enhanced her click-and-collect service, offering weekend thali feasts, a three-course meal complete with a Bollywood playlist, a quiz on India, and takeaway picnic baskets. They began to collaborate with a nearby vineyard and gin distillery, offering meals with accompanying wine, and jointly marketing to customers against the backdrop of the growing consumer movement to buy locally. Sarkar is also leading a weekly free cooking lesson that people can follow on Instagram Live. A special kit of six spice blends can be ordered beforehand to ensure the outcome is authentic. All these adaptations, says Sarkar, have resulted in their pandemic-era sales far outstripping the previous year’s. Both Sarkar and Project D mention the importance of persevering even when the going gets tough. “We’ve always had the attitude of never giving up,” says Bond. “We have this dream, this project, which we hold so dearly. And when that was nearly taken away from us, with everything that we put in, we weren’t ready to give up.” Strong branding was also key to Project D, who sold eggs using trays in their signature bubblegum pink. Their scooter, mini pickup truck, forklift and even the floors of their new bakery are all painted in the same shade. Although difficult in a pandemic, planning ahead as best as they can has also been an important element of their success. As the end of the Brexit transition period loomed, the team stockpiled some of their ingredients. “And we were right to do that, because some of our wholesalers actually ran out of some of our key ingredients,” says Poynton. For both of these independent food businesses, the past year has been hectic, often stressful, but in the end, hugely rewarding. For Sarkar, it has sometimes meant 18- or 19-hour days at work. “You can probably see the bags under our eyes,” she says. “But we’ve constantly, every day, innovated, adapted and been flexible at every single stage.” "},{"url":null,"title":"from diy kits to sustainable bespoke furniture meet the businesses reshaping interior design","story":"Given this, the digital video meetings we’ve all become used to can only take a designer so far. Nonetheless, the sector itself is proving resilient eight out of 10 people, according to a survey conducted by the Royal Institute of British Architects (Riba) in October, wanted to change their homes as soon as it was safe to do so. “The impact of Covid-19 will affect how and where we choose to live for years to come,” says Riba president Alan Jones. “For many of us, our homes are our sanctuaries, and this research indicates that many people are keener than ever to adapt and improve their homes.” Many interior designers across the UK report an increase in the number of new clients they have taken on. But as the process relies so heavily on being physically present in a space, they have had to adapt. Zoe Hewett is no stranger to finding creative ways around problems. When she first started her interior design business, Stylemongers of Bristol, the former set designer for theatre and TV productions lacked the funds to make over her own home to serve as a showcase – so instead she built a doll’s house to demonstrate her style. As a result of the pandemic, Hewett scaled back her face-to-face work, but has still found ways of expanding her business – one of which is a range of interior design kits to help people design their own homes. “At first, I was thinking about making my services accessible,” she says. “A one-to-one design consultation is worth doing for a bespoke service, but it’s always going to be out of reach for some people, so I wanted to offer something affordable, at a price point more people could afford.” The pandemic meant the project became a priority for her business, and the packs became a reality. “I may have created an envelope-stuffing role for myself,” she says. “But I love that people are getting something physical and tangible to work with.” The packs are made of recycled card and paper and are delivered in letterbox-sized packages. Hewett sees them as a way of sharing the information and techniques that she previously discussed in face-to-face workshops, where she would guide groups through the principles of interior design – from creating moodboards to where to place furniture. They contain, among other things, quizzes to help buyers explore design choices, advice on using colour and materials to create 2D-scale layouts of rooms, plus a link to an ebook with further information. Hewett says the take-up of the £50 kits has been “pretty good. I hope people find them fun as well as useful. One lady who bought one said she’s using it again with her seven-year-old to reimagine their shed. Her daughter’s got really into it, apparently.” From each commission, Hewett makes a donation to the homeless charity Crisis. “Creating nice places is what drives me,” she says. “So it makes sense to me to also help people who haven’t got anywhere to live yet.” The community focus is also important to Liselle Milner of Zenterior Design, based in St Austell, Cornwall. She works with 12 others, including builders, carpenters and upholsterers, to create indoor and outdoor spaces and bespoke furniture, all with a focus on using sustainable materials. Much of her work involves second homes or holiday lets, so the owners have not been able to travel to meet her. “We’ve always focused on the relationship with the client, getting an idea of exactly what it is they want and then making that happen, so to never meet someone face-to-face has been very odd,” she says. “Although, if you are talking to someone via Zoom, there is the advantage of seeing their house in the background, so it’s a very quick way of seeing what they already like.” Milner uses a lot of secondhand or upcycled furniture – “I want the space to look as amazing as possible for the budget we have” – but her pre-pandemic visits to charity shops and auctions have been replaced by Facebook Marketplace, and ever-greater resourcefulness as a team. “We’re looking at things we would usually outsource, like quilting, for example, and thinking: ‘Can we do that ourselves?’” she says. “It’s good creatively, and it also means we can keep to a schedule. Big furniture retailers have set specifics they work to. If a piece is made of oak, and if the oak isn’t there, then that sofa won’t be with you in 12 weeks’ time. But if we are making it, then we can use beech or another suitable wood that we can actually get hold of.” Besides changing their ways of working to comply with pandemic-related restrictions, such as visiting sites inidually instead of together, the Zenterior team have also adapted some of the other physical parts of their jobs, finding ways to keep to social distancing rules, and have stopped working on occupied domestic properties. Milner has also doubled down on Zenterior’s commitment to using local suppliers, not only to avoid delays with supply chains but also from a sense of local responsibility, as the regional tourism sector has been hit especially hard by restrictions on movement. “And there’s also the fact that Cornwall has always been a hub for artists and creative people. It makes sense to work with people who are here,” says Milner. The pandemic may have affected their traditional ways of working for now, but both Milner and Hewett are determined that its lasting effects on our homes are sustainably positive.

Since then, over 200,000 people have been diagnosed in the State, and more than 4,000 people have died.Globally, over 100 million people have been diagnosed and over 2.5\u0026nbspmillion have died since the virus was first identified in China in December 2019.NEWS AND UPDATES: - How many have been vaccinated here?Scientists have been racing to develop a vaccine that would bring an end to the pandemic, and there are now 64 different vaccines in clinical development, with another 173 in preclinical development, according to the World Health Organisation.Four of these have been authorised for use in the EU - one from AstraZeneca, one from BioNTech-Pfizer, one from Moderna and another from Johnson \u0026amp Johnson (Jannsen).The EU has put in place purchase agreements with Sanofi-GSK\u0026nbspand Curevac, and\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspis also in talks with two other vaccine producers - Novavax and Valneva. 224,861 had received their second dose.Some 184,012 of these vaccines had gone to people in long term residential care facilities, while 325,352 had gone to frontline healthcare workers and 272,286 had gone to people over the age of 70. Some\u0026nbsp20,560 people in Cohort 4 - those\u0026nbspaged between 16 and 69 at very high risk of severe Covid-19 disease - received a dose.\u0026nbspGlobally, over 500 million doses of a Covid-19 vaccine have been administered.But how do these other vaccines work, and when will they be approved for use here? Have there been any reported side effects? And when can you expect to receive a vaccine?The  Vaccine Tracker will be updated daily as the country embarks on the largest inoculation programme in the history of the State.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 70°C.EMA approval: Granted on December 21st.Overview: Developed by New York-based Pfizer and German company BioNTech this vaccine has a brand name of Comirnaty. It uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which has instructions for producing a protein from Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The person’s immune system recognises this protein as foreign and produces antibodies and activates T-cells (white blood cells) to attack it, giving them immunity. The vaccine will last for six months when stored at -70C, and five days when stored at between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. The EU has approved the withdrawal of six doses from each vial.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle and joint pain, chills and fever. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 5.4 million doses by the end of 2021.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 20°C.EMA approval: Granted on January 6th.Overview: Developed by Boston-based company Moderna, this vaccine is manufactured for EU states at partner plants in Switzerland, France and Spain before being distributed across the continent. Like the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, it uses mRNA technology to produce a Sars-CoV-2 protein, which the body then attacks to give immunity. It will last for up to six months when stored at - 20°C. The first Moderna vaccine was given in Ireland on January 16th.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, chills, fever, swollen or tender lymph nodes under the arm, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea and vomiting. Less common was redness, hives and rash at the injection site. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 870,000 doses by the end of 2021.EMA approval: Granted on January 29th.Overview: The OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine was thought of as a potential game-changer because it can be transported and stored at 2 degrees to 8 degrees for up to six months, making it much easier to move around and administer. It is also much cheaper, costing about $3-4 per shot, compared with $20 for the PfizerBioNTech jab, with the former being made on a not-for-profit basis for the duration of the pandemic.It is based on a harmless chimp cold virus that cannot grow inside human cells. Scientists have tweaked this virus so that it carries genetic material containing the instructions for a protein of the coronavirus. Once the vaccine has been administered, our bodies produce the coronavirus protein, triggering an immune response.During the trial, a dosing error led to the serendipitous finding that when clinical trial participants were given half a dose followed by a full dose, the vaccine had a higher efficacy than when participants were given two full doses, with 90 per cent efficacy in the former case and 62 per cent efficacy in the latter. This led AstraZeneca to announce in November a new global trial of the vaccine with the half dosefull dose regime.In January, a bitter row broke out between the European Union and AstraZeneca after the pharmaceutical company drastically revised downwards the number of doses it could deliver the bloc. While talks continue on how to increase production, the company has now committed to a total of 40 million doses for the EU in the first quarter of 2021.While the EMA approved the use of this vaccine for all ages, doubt was cast over its efficacy in the over 65s due to the lack of data from Astrazeneca’s clinical trials in this cohort. As a result, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Poland and Belgium have opted not to approve this product for their older population.Following suit, Ireland has also decided to use the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine for the over 70s where possible, not the AstraZeneca jab, resulting in a significant reorganisation of our vaccination plans.On March 11th Norwegian health authorities said three health workers in Norway who had recently received the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine were being treated in hospital for bleeding, blood clots and a low count of blood platelets.Norway halted the rollout of the AstraZeneca vaccine, following a similar move by Denmark. Iceland later followed suit.On Thursday, March 18th, the EMA announced it had found\u0026nbspno causal link between the vaccine and blood-clotting events and use of the vaccine\u0026nbspresumed on Saturday March 20th in Ireland.How many will Ireland get? 190,000 doses in February and a further 95,000 in early March - supply after this is not confirmed.Storage: Lasts for up to two years frozen at –20° C, and up to three months refrigerated at 2–8° C.EMA approval: Approved on March 11th.Overview: The EMA started a rolling review of this single dose vaccine from Janssen, the Belgium-based subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson on December 1st .On January 29th the company announced the results of its Phase 3 trial: the vaccine had an efficacy of 72 per cent in the United States, 66 per cent in Latin America, and 57 per cent in South Africa.This vaccine uses double-stranded DNA to deliver a protein from the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the body, thereby creating immunity. It is different from others on the market in that it requires just one injection. The EU has agreed an initial contract for 200 million doses, with an option to buy 200 million more.On February 16th the company applied to the EMA for\u0026nbspseeking authorisation for its single-dose vaccine, and it was approved on March 11th.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbsp2.2 million doses,\u0026nbsp600,000 between April and June.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: US company Novavax has developed a Covid-19 vaccine which stimulates an immune response by delivering spike proteins into the body. These spike-proteins are grown and harvested from insects. Similar technology is used in the production of vaccines for influenza and HPV. The European Commission has concluded exploratory talks with Novavax with a view to purchasing up to 200 million doses. The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 3rd.Overview: In September the EU signed a deal to purchase 300 million doses of this vaccine. It is based on the same technology as one of Sanofi’s seasonal influenza vaccines - more conventional than the mRNA used by Pfizer and Moderna - and it was thought it could play a big role in ending the pandemic. However, despite positive results from Phase 1 trials, news came in December that Phase 2 trial results showed an insufficient immune response in older adults. Phase III studies were expected to start in December, but the companies now plan to begin a phase 2b study in February with a different formulation of the vaccine. Even if their new formulation is successful, they do not expect the vaccine to be available until the end of 2021.Storage: Will last for at least 3 months at 2–8°C.Overview: The German company CureVac began its final Phase 3 trials in December, with results expected in the first quarter of 2021. It uses the same mRNA technology as the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, but can be kept at normal refrigerator temperatures. The company has signed a deal with the EU to supply 405 million doses, pending regulatory approval.The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 12th.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: Valneva is a French company which has created a Covid-19 vaccine based on their Japanese encephalitis vaccine. It delivers a chemically inactivated coronavirus and uses an adjuvant (immunity booster) to create immunity. It entered clinical trials in December and expects to have its first results by April 2021. On January 12th the European Commission concluded exploratory talks with the company for the supply of 30 million doses, with the option to buy a further 30 million.When might you be vaccinated?In December the HSE published the provisional order in which people in Ireland will be vaccinated against Covid-19.

Then, at the end of May, Ministers will assess whether the reopening of hotels, B\u0026ampBs and guesthouses will be possible the following month in June.The Government has also announced that two people who are fully vaccinated may now meet up indoors, provided it is a fortnight or more since they received their second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine.The announcement came as the State’s public health team warned the Government that the country was in a “precarious” place in relation to the prevalence of Covid-19.Nphet letterIn a letter to Government, acting chief medical officer Dr Ronan Glynn said the level of infection was “substantially higher than when restrictions were eased after previous waves of infection – approximately twice that experienced in early December 2020, and 50 times that in late June 2020”.The team also warned that the dominance of the more transmissible B117 variant means that “for similar levels of close social contact, viral transmissions and effective reproduction number… will be 30-70 per cent greater than in 2020”.The reproductive number is already at or above 1, they warned.“The high starting point of 600 cases per day means that case numbers rise rapidly to over 2,000 per day within four weeks.“Unfortunately, the significant ‘headroom’ that was available last summer when case counts were very low isn’t available now, and any increase in transmission will have significant impacts in a short space of time,” the team warned the Government.New modelling from Nphet also suggests that vaccinations will quickly and significantly reduce risk over a short period of time from May 2021 to August 2021. The modelling shows that vaccinations will reduce mortality when those over 70 are fully protected but will have a smaller effect on hospital and critical care numbers until the wider population is vaccinated.Meanwhile, an expert group convened by the Government has recommended the widespread use of rapid antigen tests, including the potential for mass rollout in schools by September of this year, although the group was split on the role of such tests in reopening society and economy.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4520165.1616687940!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"british government guidance on union flag reignites ni debate","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tLoyalist protesters converge on Belfast City Hall in 2013 over removal of the union flag from the the building. File photograph: PAThe British government’s latest guidance on flying of the union flag in England, Scotland and Wales has prompted unionist politicians to call for the standard to be flown year round on government buildings in Northern Ireland.Unionists also have linked the flags issue to the Northern Ireland protocol. This has led to an Irish Sea border and the disruption of trade from Britain to the North.On Wednesday the British government called on all local councils to fly the union flag on civic buildings as a sign of British national identity. This was part of an initiative to promote the union of Britain and Northern Ireland.The guidance, however, does not apply to Northern Ireland where the union flag flies over government buildings on about 20 designated days annually.At the end of 2012 and through 2013 Northern Ireland and Belfast in particular was subjected to serious loyalist violence, protests and business disruption after Belfast City Council voted that the flag should fly over city hall on the designated days and not all-year round.DUP Lagan Valley MP Jeffrey Donaldson said on Thursday that flying the ensign 365 days a year over British government buildings should be extended to Northern Ireland.“Many will see it as bizarre that the UK government is only deciding in 2021 to fly the union flag, the flag of our nation, on all government buildings every day. When I visit other nations around the world, flying the national flag on government buildings is commonplace,” he said.Mr Donaldson added that if the British government “wanted to immediately improve the union they would start with the removal of the protocol”.The Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV) party also called for the flag to fly every day over government buildings.Meanwhile unionists, as they had threatened, launched a legal action aimed at scrapping the protocol. They also started a crowdfunding appeal to help pay for the actionwhich is being taken by a coalition of pro-union politicians such as DUP leader and First Minister Arlene Foster, former Ulster Unionist first minister David (Lord) Trimble and former Labour MP Kate (Baroness) Hoey.Ms Foster said the DUP would work with other unionists to send a “united message to our government and to free Northern Ireland from the protocol. We cannot allow our United Kingdom to be ripped apart and our UK internal market to be ided in order to protect the single market of the EU.”Lord Trimble said he joined in the action “because Northern Ireland’s place as an integral part of the United Kingdom is at stake. Extensive parts of Northern Ireland – much of its economic fabric – have been turned into a colony of the European Union. ”UUP leader Steve Aiken said the “protocol fundamentally undermines the integrity of the United Kingdom, the Belfast Agreement and the principle of consent”.TUV leader Jim Allister said the “protocol annexes Northern Ireland into the EU, leaving us subject to laws we did not make and cannot change”.Baroness Hoey said she was “not prepared to allow those living in Northern Ireland to be treated as second-class citizens of our own country – the UK”.Former Brexit Party MEP Ben Habib said the UK was “the only country in history to have voluntarily partitioned itself. We must not rest until the protocol is ended. It is vital that all pro-unionists join together in this fight.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4524392.1617170397!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"state to invest 17m to create european style outdoor dining","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Pedestrianised Princes Street in Cork: The outdoor dining enhancement scheme will be run by Fáilte Ireland and local authorities around the country.

Part one will be available to inidual tourism and hospitality businesses including cafes, hotels, restaurants and attractions where food is sold for consumption on the premises.It is one of several areas under Ms Martin’s brief that will reopen in the coming months, including the resumption of amateur and high level sports, and the planned reopening of zoos, outdoor attractions and heritage sites. Museums and galleries are to be considered for reopening in May, while a data-driven roadmap for the tourism sector is being worked on.Local authorities will be able to apply for the larger sums under part two of the same scheme to upgrade streets and public spaces and implement weather-proofing solutions to facilitate year-round dining along the lines of those seen in European cities.Permanent weatherproofing structures, including parasols, electric heaters and wind-protective screens will be eligible for funding.Entertainment sectorMeanwhile, the arts and live entertainment sector is in danger of losing skilled workers because there is no roadmap for the sector’s recovery, an Oireachtas Committee has heard.Speakers from across the entertainment sector told the Joint Committee on Media, Tourism, Arts, Culture, Sport and the Gaeltacht that the industry needs to see a clear roadmap to reopening, linked to vaccinations.Pre-event Covid-19 testing and vaccination passports were also suggested as a way of reopening the sector.Liam FitzGerald of Epic, who represents workers in the live production sector, said many venues would be forced to close for good if no clear guidance was produced.“For example, that when x per cent of adults are vaccinated, we can do such a scale of an event, and when y per cent are vaccinated, then the events can advance up to another level.”Mr FitzGerald said skilled entertainment workers were already moving to other industries. “A specialist group of people, who would do a lot of climbing in high places and hanging structures in entertainment venues, a lot of them have gone to work in steel construction and building sites.”Entertainment workers are also considering emigrating in the absence of certainty from the Irish Government, and many have already been offered jobs. “There is a terrible risk of skills retention becoming a major issue,” said Mr FitzGerald.He also warned that despite Government supports such as the PUP and wage subsidy scheme, large parts of the sector were left behind, such as supplier SMEs.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4524354.1617132017!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"thousands of workers misclassified as self employed by state committee told","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAll couriers are considered self-employed, and they must appeal that decision if they wish it to be changed. Photograph: iStockThousands of workers are, and have been, misclassified as self-employed by the State, the Dáil Public Accounts Committee has been told.Activist and employment rights campaigner Martin McMahon said that all couriers had, for example, been labelled as being self-employed workers based on a test case decision by a Department of Social Welfare appeals officer in 1995.“Employment status must always be decided on the applicable law and the inidual circumstances of each case. Despite agreement from the Revenue Commissioners that each case must be taken on its own facts in accordance with case law, the Revenue Commissioners have openly admitted to the Public Accounts Committee that this is not what happens in practice.”Mr McMahon said that just because a person was a courier, it could not be said that all couriers were self-employed.He said the Department of Social Protection had admitted that it was “doing test cases” and using the precedents from those test cases to label entire industries as self-employed.‘Default self-employed’“The way it is working at the moment, the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social Protection are classifying workers as default self-employed and, if the worker wants to appeal that decision, they must go then go through a process.”Mr McMahon said a worker must first make their case to the Scope section of the Department of Social Protection and the employer could appeal any decision that found the worker was an employee to the Social Welfare Appeals Office.“If the Social Welfare Appeals Office overturns the decision of the Scope section decision, which they have done with every courier case since 1993, then the worker’s access to the courts starts at High Court level.Mr McMahon said the system was “rigged” so that the worker could not simply overturn the decision that they were self-employed. He said if they wanted to do so it involved a huge costly process that started in the High Court and would go to the Supreme Court. ‘Misinterpretation’Mr McMahon told the committee that the State was “granting illegal State aid, in the form of a PRSI exemption, to ‘selected’ employers based on misinterpretation of the law”.“ It is a tax break which puts compliant employers at a distinct economic disadvantage and denies employees all their rights as employees. The mechanisms used by Department of Social Welfare and Revenue are unlawful test cases.”The chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, Brian Stanley of Sinn Féin, said the Revenue Commissioners had maintained to it in correspondence that each case was inidual and needed to be considered on its own merits.Mr Stanley said this position from Revenue seemed to be significantly at odds with the situation in the courier industry where the default position was that personnel were considered to be self-employed in the first instance.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4524950.1617186626!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"widespread sunshine over coming days before weather turns on easter sunday","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPeople living in the east can expect temperatures up to 16 degrees on Wednesday, according to Met Éireann.

Any lingering fog will clear on Wednesday morning in the east, making way for a dry afternoon bathed in sunshine. Western dwellers will experience highest temperatures of 10 to 13 degrees, while people living in the east can expect temperatures up to 16 degrees, according to the national forecaster.Patchy rain will affect northern and southern coastal counties overnight, while misty patches will develop in light to moderate breezes, the service predicted.Met Éireann meteorologist Aoife Kealy said an anticyclone to the northwest of Ireland, around Greenland, will push warm and settled weather across the country over the next few days.“High pressure will build from the north and that is going to bring your good and settled weather . . . It will be really nice and bright on Friday,” she said.Thursday will bring good spells of sunshine, perhaps punctuated by some drizzle in eastern and coastal areas as cloud pushes in from the Irish Sea, according to the meteorological service. Highest temperatures could reach 18 degrees in the south, although a little cooler in the breezy east.Widespread sunshineWidespread sunshine will reign again on Friday, which is expected to be a dry day with temperatures of up to 16 degrees. Again, eastern areas may be slightly cooler due to light northeasterly breezes.The forecaster said Thursday and Friday nights will be cooler, with mist and fog developing in light breezes. Lowest temperatures could reach zero degrees overnight on Friday.The weekend will start largely dry with generous bouts of sunshine, although cloud will build through Saturday afternoon.“It will probably be a little more cloudy on Saturday but there will still be plenty of sunny spells,” Ms Kealy said. There will be highest temperatures of 10 to 14 degrees.A cold front will move down from the north from Sunday morning. It will be “quite cool during the day and cold at night”, Ms Kealy added. Rain will push down from the north towards dawn on Sunday, heralding the start of a wetter and cooler couple of days. Easter Sunday and Monday will be dampened by widespread showers from the north, which will turn wintry at times. Frost will sweep across the country at night.Looking into the second week of the Easter holidays, there remains some “variation” in model predictions, Ms Kealy said.

File photograph: Alan Betson Northern Ireland institutions are “just about hanging on” after a “bruising number of years” and the focus must be on building relationships rather than on a border poll, Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney has said.Mr Coveney also told the Seanad that “we can move away from threats of legal action” after the UK’s unilateral move to extend the grace period for post-Brexit checks on some goods entering Northern Ireland from Britain until October 1st.During a debate on Brexit he told Senators,“we can get back to partnership through a specialised committee and joint committee” and can get the Northern Ireland protocol “back on an even keel”.He also said it was an opportunity for “more pragmatism and flexibility from the European Commission as well”.The Minister admitted that “I’ve become some sort of a bogey man” over the protocol but “the irony is” that his office more than any other “has been constantly talking to the European Commission about need to for pragmatism and compromise”.In an impassioned contribution he said the narrative “now is that it is being foisted on Northern Ireland by the EU and Irish Government and it’s not”.The protocol “was designed as much in London as it was in Brussels, which people seem to conveniently forget”, he pointed out.It is a solution “that isn’t perfect but is certainly the best way of mitigating the disruption on the island of Ireland”.He warned that a collapse in the protocol would result in two “very unpalatable choices” for Ireland.To protect Ireland’s place in the EU market, the State would have to put some kind of border infrastructure in place, which would be politically impossible “or we would be taken out of the EU market by default”.United IrelandSpeaking about calls for a border poll on a united Ireland, Mr Coveney said the focus had to be on building relationships first because the Northern Ireland institutions are not functioning as they should. They are “just about hanging on” after a “bruising number of years”.He said that “perhaps the most challenging element of Brexit” was in how to rebuild relationships “that have undoubtedly been damaged.“Good things happen in Northern Ireland when the British and Irish governments work together,” he added.Earlier Fianna Fáil Senator Niall Blaney said there is no border in the Irish Sea and “we should knock that every chance we get”. He said “it is an imaginary border”.The Donegal Senator said unionists are in an awkward position and “we don’t need to do anything that ramps that up but rather the opposite”.He said those calling for a North-South poll needed to be reminded “of how the Good Friday Agreement was won”.He said a similar sentiment is needed now “this country coming together as one isn’t necessarily about territory but is more about people”.He said of Fianna Fáil’s relationship with Sinn Féin that “we sometimes rub each other up the wrong way” but everyone had work to do for a border poll “down the road” and Sinn Féin needed to put more emphasis on building relationships with unionists.

However, it is currently legal to import dogs with cropped ears from abroad, and top breeders which supply celebrities charge thousands of pounds for such animals.Rita Ora was recently criticised by activists including the Focus On Animal Law group for featuring a dog with cropped ears in her music video.

There is no suggestion any of these celebrities broke the law.The  understands ministers are concerned by a perceived rise in ear cropping, and they are now working with the RSPCA to see how widespread the practice is, and crack down on problem breeders.There are also plans to ban imports of these dogs being considered, with sources inside the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs adding that this legislation should be easier to put in place now we have left the EU. A Defra source said: We already have some of the world’s highest animal welfare standards.

We joke that it\u0027s nice to see even the professionals muck it up sometimes.”He added, tongue obviously in cheek: “Whatever happens in the Suez Canal, does tend to happen in Littlehampton.”The 43-year-old, whose own sailing ship Reef Knot lay moored just upstream from Elise, said: These things happen. I haven\u0027t blocked a river yet but I have in my learned experience done some things on my boat.  We only get six ships a year, it is quite a novel experience. Whenever there is ship movement, quite a lot of sailors like myself and our members like to go out and watch them come in and out because it is incredible how they manage to navigate such a large vessel.We struggle to navigate the river in our boats because of the strong tide. I believe the river Arun may be the second fastest flowing in England and especially with this strong tide .”Of course nobody is seriously comparing Littlehampton Harbour, which opens onto the English Channel from the River Arun, to the Suez Canal. While one is a pleasant backwater port, the other is one of the busiest shipping thoroughfares in the world. Even after the Ever Given was freed, business chiefs warned that not only could delays to goods being shipped around the world by boats caught up in the blockage last for months, but so could legal issues arising from the chaos, as customers try to recover the cost of delayed or expired products.Littlehampton harbour, as well as attracting thousands of leisure craft from all over the UK and Europe, also handles a more modest 60 ships a year from Ireland and continental Europe, with cargo including stone, marble chippings and timber.Harry Gregory, Littlehampton’s harbour master, said: “A limited 300-metre-long section of the harbour where these ships discharge had to be closed to all craft to ensure safety of other harbour users whilst tug ERICA supported by smaller workboats TENACITY and WINDSONG carried out the operation. “During this period two small commercial fishing vessels were delayed by approximately two hours in their return to their moorings with their day’s catch.“A small number of leisure vessels moored at Littlehampton Marina or further up the River Arun were also delayed in their day’s trip out to sea by up to three hours.“I would like to thank all those who were delayed in their use of this part of the harbour for their cooperation as well as all those involved in the operation to move the vessel back to berth.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"macron really could go history president handed france far right","story":"Emmanuel Macron came to power four years ago, snatching the presidency of France with a brand new party, disdainful of old hierarchies and old practice.

Back in 2017, Macron faced Marine Le Pen in the runoff, and it was easy to paint her, a decade older and holding her legitimacy from her controversial father Jean-Marie, as a woman from the past. Today it’s Macron who’s running on four years on controversy and mismanagement, from the Gilets Jaunes protests to his botched pensions reform, culminating in France’s disastrous vaccine rollout, leaving the country hobbled by stop-and-go lockdowns, with no convincing end in sight. Meanwhile, Le Pen, having rebranded her party as the “National Rally” increasingly looks like a viable alternative in the runoff. In 2017, she lost against Macron 34-66. Now, polls give much narrower estimates, 48-52. “It’s well within the margin of error”, Le Pen said Tuesday in a long interview with the Anglo-American Press Association. She was careful to remind us that both François Mitterrand and Jacques Chirac had run unsuccessfully twice before winning the presidency. She praised Boris Johnson’s Tories’ decisive success in the Red Wall constituencies: “There’s no longer a left-right ide there’s a ide between globalists and the losers of globalisation, who saw in Mr Johnson the man who could defend them.”Could Emmanuel Macron go down in history as the President who handed power to the far right? Since the Mitterrand years, facing a Le Pen in a presidential runoff has been a guarantee of victory, as Left and Right united into a Front Républicain against “fascism”. But Ms Le Pen has managed to detoxify her party to such an extent that the current Home Secretary, the former Gaullist turned Macronista Gérald Darmanin, himself the grandson of an Algerian migrant, could accuse her in a debate of being “too soft” on Islamism.Last time, Marine lost all chances of victory in the last pre-runoff debate against Macron. She came underprepared, blowsy and blustery, while Macron did his Mastermind champion impersonation, in the grand ENA graduate manner. “Elle n’est pas présidentielle”, the verdict went even among her own supporters on Twitter. If today’s meeting was any indication, this is not an experience she wants to repeat: she moved between health, immigration and economic policy with apparent ease. But mostly, she will be facing a President who, for over a year of Covid pandemic, has been repeating the same supercilious number on an increasingly restive audience.The rejection of Emmanuel Macron, which he is said to call “very unfair” in private, is widespread. It’s not just the top-down grand manner, delivering philosophical lessons to the peons in his own time (never under half an hour), using the typical, slightly hollow delivery of the French classical stage actor he once wanted to become, that grates. It’s that, as everyone from Uber drivers to the corner pharmacist to shopkeepers to bus drivers will tell you, “he lies”. Three quarters of the French public think he lied about the need for masks rather than admit that France was unable to source them. Many think he lied about availability of PPE for care workers. And it’s becoming apparent that he\u0027s lied, repeatedly, about vaccines: not just on his unwarranted trashing of AstraZeneca, but on the organisation of the rollout. His ministers hide political decisions behind lies, too: it is becoming increasingly clear that children contaminate adults in schools yet the Education Minister, who wants to keep schools open for economic reasons, holds by the fiction that asymptomatic pupils are not dangerous in the face of increased casualties among teachers.Worse, no-one apologises. Not the president, not his ministers, not the technocrats. They believe that, in the old French way, this is only an admission of weakness. In many ways, these thirty-somethings in the sharp suits have lost track of reality and have become the old men they disdained four years ago. The French  would prefer difficult truths, and they want apologies. And their memories will be long enough to shape the 2022 election.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"tartan neither sturgeon nor salmond truly wants achieve scottish","story":"As Alex Salmond returns to the political fray with his own custom-made Alba Party, inevitable comparisons have been drawn between his latest political enterprise and my decision in 2019 to launch the Brexit Party. I like to think I have little in common with Mr Salmond personally. But there are more fundamental differences between us, too. The fact is that from the moment the UK Independence Party was launched in 1993, my crusade was for our nation to be sovereign once again. What got me out of bed every morning was the desire to help make Britain truly free. Salmond, and his successor as SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon, have a very different vision for what they misleadingly call an “independent” Scotland.Salmond started his campaign for independence in Scotland years before UKIP existed. He and Sturgeon state all the time that self-rule is their goal. Yet the crucial distinction between the political struggle in which I was involved to unshackle Britain from the EU and the movements run by Salmond and Sturgeon is that neither of them actually wants to achieve Scottish self-determination. Both of them are EU fanatics and their primary objective is for Scotland to join that bloc. Remarkably, neither of them has ever been properly challenged about this.  To be both an independent state and a member of the EU is incompatible on many levels. For this reason it is obvious that a Sturgeon or Salmond-led independent Scottish government would have to hand over to Brussels control of vast swathes of Scotland’s public and economic structures. Yet entering into a submissive relationship of this nature would mean that Scotland had no right to call itself a truly independent country at all. All of this presupposes that Scotland’s application to join the EU would even be accepted following any break with the UK, of course. And there is no doubt that Brussels bureaucrats would be wary. Firstly, they would be concerned about the dire state of Scotland’s public finances. Second, they would also be worried that bringing the Scots on board and what that would mean for the Catalonian independence movement. Even if we were not living in topsy-turvy economic times, I cannot imagine Brussels being able to give Edinburgh any of the guarantees needed for its independence. I believe that all of this offers Boris Johnson’s government its best chance to save the Union. In the last weeks of the 2014 referendum campaign on Scottish separation, Salmond only really started getting into trouble when it was pointed out publicly that if an independent Scotland were to join the EU, it would have to make a treaty commitment to join the Euro. This was denied. The SNP claimed it could keep Sterling without being formally tied to the Bank of England. Yet even if this were true, it hardly sounds like independence either. And we haven’t considered how the SNP proposes to plug the enormous gaps in funding currently supplied by Westminster that would be lost if Scotland were to go its own way.  Ultimately, a genuine Scottish nationalist would not want to be part of the UK or the EU. This is an intellectually honest position. What is - in a funny way - heartening is that many SNP voters hold it. If Sturgeon\u0027s and Salmond\u0027s slippery use of the word “independence” can be cast into doubt, and if the splits within the various nationalist parties can be exposed and exploited, the Union will remain intact. So why is no one following this line yet? For the simple reason that in the Edinburgh political and media bubble that has grown up around the Scottish Parliament, support for EU membership has been almost universal. When, in 2013, I was attacked by a mob in an Edinburgh street for daring to question the use of the word independence, there was no one there to defend me. The Scottish Conservative Party is part of the problem. It is certainly not the solution. Just as the SNP’s claim to want “independence” is fraudulent, so the Scottish Tories’ assertion that it is a politically conservative party is barely credible. It was solidly on the side of Remain in 2016, and to a large degree I believe that many of its politicians still feel that way. Yes, its former leader, Ruth Davidson, had personal appeal. As a Remainer, however, she could never attack the SNP effectively over its bogus claims for independence because she shared its aim of wanting to be in the EU.The goal is wide open now. Nicola Sturgeon would have wanted Scotland to be part of the EU’s vaccine plan. Had that happened, thousands more Scottish lives would have been lost to covid. As the benefits of Brexit become clearer to every Briton, it is time for the Unionists to go on the attack. Whatever Sturgeon and Salmond are proposing for Scotland, it is not independence.  More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"tories should let sadiq khans london go bust","story":"A £5.50 a day charge for driving into Greater London. Another 20 or 30 per cent on bus and tube fares. An extra levy on business rates, and a 20p tax on Cornettos sold in the capital’s parks now that the sun is shining again. Okay, I made that last one up, but the rest are all serious proposals put forward for rescuing London from the financial crisis about to engulf it.There is a problem, however. There is no point in the Government constantly bailing out show-boating mayors. It will only encourage even more extravagance and platitudinous virtue signalling. Sure, London will need to re-invent itself – but fortunately that happens to be the one thing it is really good at.There is no question that London is heading for a cash crunch. Its commuter-dependent transport system has been bankrupted by the Covid-19 epidemic, and there are already talks with the Treasury over a bail-out worth close to £16 billion just to keep the tubes and busses running. It is going to get worse over the next year. Working from home may not be as popular as its more swivel-eyed evangelists claim – we are all a little bored of our kitchen tables by now – but it looks unlikely we will go back to a nine-to-five desk life and London with its densely packed business districts will feel the impact of that more than anywhere.The demise of retailing will hit its great shopping streets, the flight to the family-friendly market towns of the home counties will damage its residential areas while moving civil servants and broadcasters north in a drive to level up the country will erode its central place in governing and the media.No major, developed nation wants to see its capital go bust. And London has been the powerhouse of the British economy, contributing massively to its wealth and prosperity. It is not hard to understand why the Treasury is willing to shovel money to keep it afloat. There are two big issues, however. First, bail-outs send precisely the wrong signal. Khan has been a useless mayor, certainly compared to Boris Johnson, and even to the reptilian but effective Ken Livingstone. He has allowed crime to run out of control, mismanaged the transport system, and encouraged development in all the wrong places. With depressing inevitability, the capital’s clueless woke electorate will forgive all that because he poked fun at Donald Trump and Brexit at all the right moments and re-elect him next month.That is up to them, but there is no reason for the Treasury to help out. It is what insurers refer to as moral hazard: if there is no cost to behaving stupidly, it will keep on happening (that is why your car insurance goes up if you keep making claims). If London gets bailed out, Khan won’t be grateful. He will just come back for more, and so will Andy Burnham in Manchester, and even Andy Street in Birmingham. The subsidies won’t ever end. If taxes or fares have to go up, it would be far better to leave it to Khan to do that, and let him face the consequences at the ballot box. Next, it will stop London reinventing itself. Let’s keep in mind that the settlements around the Thames have been a prosperous trading hub for at least a couple of millennia. If the occasional plague could finish it off it would have been wheat fields long ago.London\u0027s economy is about to go through some major changes, of that there can be no question. There will be fewer traditional offices, and a lot more hot-desking, co-working hubs. The tubes and buses will be less crowded (hardly the end of the world if you live on the Northern Line) but should run 24-7 as the city plugs itself into faster-growing Pacific markets. Cavernous retail spaces will have to be rezoned as homes, schools, or, more futuristically, vertical farms or drone delivery and flying taxi hubs (now there is something a really forward-thing mayor would be focussing on).We don’t quite know what London’s economy will look like in a decade. A cross between Silicon Valley, Wall Street and Venice, mixing technology, finance, education, professional services and leisure, seems the most plausible outcome. We will see.There is one thing we know for sure, however. Its people and markets will decide what it does best. Bailing-out a self-regarding Mayor won’t help it get there. In fact, it would be far better to leave London to sink or swim – because the chances are it will swim just fine. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"tricked spending 8850 caravan didnt exist","story":"Holiday scams are a growing risk as fraudsters look to profit from the pent-up desire to get away this summer, major banks have warned.UK Finance, the trady body, said consumers should be wary of criminals advertising fake caravans for sale, offering illegitimate refunds for cancelled trips or too-good-to-be-true travel deals.Figures released last week showed that a record £479 million was lost to bank transfer scams last year.British consumers have faced the best part of a year locked down and unable to travel or spend as much money as they are used to and many have been able to save more as a result.Experts warned that, as restrictions are lifted, this could create an opportunity for scammers seeking to liberate victims of their boosted savings pots.Ashley Hart, head of fraud at TSB, said: “Fraudsters are reading the lockdown-easing roadmap like everybody else, and are ready to seize the opportunity to target customers again.”Katy Worobec, a director of economic crime at UK Finance, said: “From advertising fake listings for caravans and rentals or pretending to offer fake flight tickets, criminals will use a range of sophisticated methods to steal people’s money.”Last year’s lockdown lifting provided similar opportunities for fraudsters looking to separate consumers from their cash.And the next few months will be seized upon in a similar way, experts said. In addition to this, the financial impact of coronavirus on people’s wallets could also make people more vulnerable to fraud. While some have struggled financially during the pandemic, others have been able to save money by working from home and not commuting or buying expensive lunches near the office.Analysis by AJ Bell of Bank of England figures published this week showed that an excess £129 billion was saved by households since the start of the pandemic.And this could be jumped upon by criminals. Mr Hart said: “They are likely to be targeting the savings many people have been able to build up during lockdown, and also people’s desire to get away for a holiday – in the UK or further afield.”The rush to capitalise on lockdown lifting could also cause people to lower their defences in a bid to make sure they can get away.UK Finance is warning people to be wary of caravan scams, where criminals taking advantage of the growing demand of staycations, list caravans or motorhomes on auction sites, perhaps citing lockdown restrictions as a reason people cannot view the vehicle.In fact there is no vehicle and once the money has been transferred the seller will disappear.He had recently been diagnosed with liver cancer and wanted to buy the vehicle as a place for family members to stay overnight while ferrying him from his home in Blackburn to hospital appointments in Leeds. If he could pay the full amount upfront, however, the seller could send the vehicle to him. He checked with family members before transferring a sum of £8,850 to the seller. That was when they stopped answering his calls.A spokesman said: “We have the utmost sympathy for Mr McGovern and all those who fall victim to the criminals who carry out scams.”The scam took place in November last year.He said: “For around three weeks after it happened I was gutted.

But government plans to improve highways lead to “wasteful patch and mend repairs”, according to the Asphalt Industry Alliance. Its annual local authority road maintenancereport blasts short-term boosts in funding and calls for long-term moves to tackle the poor state of many surfaces. The AIA says: “The th survey reports a % increase in highway maintenance budgets which were, in part, due to additional funding from central Government, including the Pothole Fund in England, as well as supplementary pots to support changes as a result of Covid- needs and active travel ambitions. “However, budgets reported are still lower than they were two years ago, and road conditions have yet to see any signicant improvement. “This up-down approach to funding results in wasteful patch and mend repairs as local authorities have a statutory duty to maintain the highway but don’t have the scope or certainty of funding to implement more cost effective, proactive repairs.”Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced a five-year, £.bn Potholes Fund at last year’s Budget. A £m instalment was unveiled last month, with the South West getting £m, South East £.m, North West £.m, East of England £.m, West Mids £.m, East Mids £.m, Yorks and Humber £m and the North East £.m. The Department for Transport said the money was enough to fill  million potholes. But AIA chairman Rick Green said last night: “While the extra funding in   was welcomed, using it to repeatedly fill in potholes is essentially a failure as it does nothing to improve the resilience of the network. “The average frequency of road surfacing is now once every  years and the bill to fix the backlog of maintenance work on our local roads in England and Wales remains in excess of £bn.” "},{"url":null,"title":"uk a beacon world over","story":"NewsUK not institutionally racist - but overt racism still exists, review findsIn the major research it was concluded that Britain is not a \"post-racial\" society, and racism persists, but issues around race and racism are becoming \"less important\"mirrorShareCommentsByWilliam WalkerNews Reporter:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR NewsThe Commission said the UK could be a beacon to others in tackling racism \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get US and UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

In the major research it was concluded that Britain is not yet a post-racial society. But issues around race and racism are becoming less important, the Commission on Race and Ethnic disparities has found. While claims that Britain is still institutionally racist are not borne out by evidence, the Commission said, overt racism still remains, particularly online. Commission chairman Tony Sewell said creating a multi-ethnic society was aposhardapos but the UK had become a beacon to the world in successfully creating a multi-ethnic society. Its report, commissioned in the wake of last yearaposs Black Lives Matter protests, said there have been improvements such as increasing ersity in elite professions and a shrinking ethnicity pay gap, although disparities remain. It also found that children from many ethnic communities do as well or better than white pupils in compulsory education, with black Caribbean pupils the only group to perform less well. And it said the pay gap between all ethnic minorities and the white majority population has shrunk to .%, and is not signicant for employees under . The commission said education was the single most emphatic success story of the British ethnic minority experience and the most important tool to reduce racial disparities. Success in education and, to a lesser extent, the economy should be regarded as a model for other white-majority countries, it added. The report states: We found that most of the disparities we examined, which some attribute to racial discrimination, often do not have their origins in racism.  However, it notes that some communities continue to be haunted by historic racism, which is creating deep mistrust and could be a barrier to success. The -page report makes  recommendations, including for extended school days to be phased in, starting with disadvantaged areas, to help pupils catch up on missed learning during the pandemic. Children from disadvantaged backgrounds should also have access to better quality careers advice in schools, funded by university outreach programmes. And it is calling for more research to examine the drivers in communities where pupils perform well, so these can be replicated to help all children succeed.

The first beers of the year were served at The Beach Bar on Cleethorpes Promenade, Lincs, on Monday, even though pubs remain closed in lockdown. Thirsty customers enjoying the mini-heatwave queued for  minutes to be served with an alcoholic drink. But North East Lincolnshire licensing officers have since served a notice on the premises, ordering it to stop selling alcohol. Angry owner Kash Pungi claims his business is exempt and said he was not given a chance to explain when the regulation was served on him.  He told Grimsby Live : It is ridiculous. I will be going to court over this.They are making it harder for businesses in Cleethorpes that are just trying to provide a service.

Kash was operating a click and collect service where customers pre-order with a text message and insists he was following regulations after taking advice from a leading licensing consultant. Before the notice was served, he said: We came down just to do a clean up ready for the venue to open for slushy drinks. People kept askingthey could have a drink as well. So with the new regulations in place, I thought we should provide the service. We are making people happy and giving Cleethorpes a service.

Kash, who has run leisure facilities, clubs and bars for more than  years said: It is a family businesses with my son Liam and mum Kanta serving. It is another venture for me. It is a challenge and the demand is definitely there. It is mostly families with kids having a slushy and grown ups having a drink.  One customer said: I have not had a pint in over four months.

Believed to be some of the oldest buildings in Taunton - St Margaretaposs Almshouses are now homes.They started out as a leper hospital - or Leprosaria - in the th century where diseased locals were locked away, Somerset Live reports.The building is said to have featured secret underground tunnels to transport the dead to a nearby cemetery. Although today leprosy is better understood, the disease struck fear into medieval minds, and those ravaged by leprosy were shunned not only through fear of contagion, but because they were so hideously disfigured. In the th and th centuries the disease was rampant and the growth of towns like Taunton helped it spread, as it thrives on close human contact. In  the English Church Council ordered that lepers should not live among the healthy, and local leprosy sufferers were locked away at St Margaretaposs Almshouses. It was then known as the hospital of the Holy Ghost and St Margaret with Glastonbury Abbey taking over the patronage in the late th century. By the th century, Leprosy had all but died out, but by then the hospital was considered beyond reasonable repair. So Abbot Richard Bere rebuilt it as almshouses in the early th century - although after the dissolution, the associated chapel was demolished. The building somehow survived and from  to  St Margaretaposs continued as almshouses, cared for by a local parish. In the late s St Margaretaposs was converted into a hall of offices for the the Rural Community Council along with accommodation for the Somerset Guild of Craftsmen. And it was around this time that the building started to give up its secrets. In , workmen carrying out groundworks for new houses in Leycroft Road began to unearth bones.  The find was described as being of a aposlarge numberapos of bones, both human and animal, and were promptly investigated by Mr H St George Gray from the Somerset Archaelogical and National History Society. He announced that there was not one complete skeleton among the bones, but had identied a skull, believed to belong to a woman, dating back to medieval times. The skull, he said, was incredibly thick and it was believed the bones were the remains of those who had been treated at the hospital.

Another few minutes, and Boris Johnson’s we might have caught him with his mistress in their family home. Another few weeks of successful vaccine rollout, and Boris Johnson’s country might have forgotten the true measure of the man. The Mirror’s Jenner Arcuri world exclusive has come at the perfect moment.Just when we were feeling grateful – as jab success takes centre stage, nudging his pitul pandemic performance into the background, a reminder that we’ve all been screwed by Boris Johnson.As poet Maya Angelou famously said: “When someone shows you who they are, believe them the first time.” This is a bloke with such little respect for the mother of four of his children that he not only cheats on her, he can’t even be bothered to travel anywhere to do it.He doesn’t cover his tracks, but s***s where he eats, just before she gets home. He has sex on the family sofa with someone who takes a sneaky selfie in the kitchen – ie fully expects a time to come when she’ll need proof she was there.  That same sofa is where his kids sat – yesterday  That morning  Straight afterwards  – to watch telly.If only we could have been vaccinated so we were immune to the traumatic mental images Jenner’s tell-all has left us with.Lost socks, limp pasta, and – Et tu, Boris  – pretentious Shakespeare chat as foreplay.What light through yonder window breaks  Well hopefully not the headlamps on your we’s car, eh   Jenner Arcuri had to text Johnson afterwards to tell him to wash the plates they’d eaten off, take out the bin bag she’d thrown her tights away in.Even at the height of her feelings for the man she was “enchanted” with, she still knew he was either too stupid or too arrogant to work out that he needed to remove the evidence from the scene of the crime. Jenner was awarded a total of £, – coincidentally a pound for every coronavirus victim who has died so far on Boris’ watch – in public money.She was also given privileged access – not a euphemism – to three official trips that just so happened to be led by one Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson.  Jenner has always insisted Mr Johnson had no influence on this. Maybe one man’s overseas trade mission is another man’s dirty weekend.Oh, paid for with taxpayer’s money, let’s not forget. He seems to have had that one on us. Thrice. The Greater London Authority are conducting an inquiry into Johnson’s conduct.  The vaccine programme in this country is unarguably a triumph. It’s an unlikely, brilliant relief – a huge achievement we didn’t dare to dream of even a few bleak months ago. S’pose it’s not really a surprise that Boris has finally found something he can do, and that it’s sticking things in people. But it does not, cannot, erase the pain, suffering and loss his woeful incompetence has been directly responsible for.The catalogue of mistakes, the infuriating conceit, the carelessness, the poor planning, the apparent shady deals with Tory cronies, the billions of pounds wasted without consequence .Boris Johnson faces an inquiry by the Greater London Authority - responsible for the mayor’s office - over claims his failure to declare his relationship with Arcuri may have been a breach of the Nolan Principles of Public Le, which are contained in the Mayor of London’s code of conduct. Arcuri was granted access to events at three top level trade missions, despite her businesses not meeting the criteria for the trips. The Independent Office for Police Conduct said there was no evidence he’d committed the criminal offence of misconduct in public office but he may have breached the Nolan Principles. Len Duvall, the chair of the GLA oversight committee which is conducting the investigation said: Our investigation will consider whether Boris Johnson conducted himself in a way that’s expected from anyone in that position.It’s important we get those answers, because Londoners deserve to have their politicians held accountable."},{"url":null,"title":"huge 12 bed property sea","story":"NewsHuge -bed property by the sea on sale for £, - same as garage in LondonThe sprawling building is located just outside of Ballybunion in Co.

However, at the time, Kate had said she had gone in a personal capacity to pay her respects to the -year-old whose body was found days after she went missing while walking home. Speaking on the Today programme this morning, Dame Cressida also said the Met was fully aware beforehand the royal would be in attendance.

The Commissioner went on to say the Met treated the vigil honouring the tragic -year-old, who died after going missing on a walk home, as an unlawful gathering. She said: It was clearly possible under the law for somebody who lived locally to walk as many did and lay flowers legally, there are other reasons why people might be in the area and they could have laid flowers calmly and peacefully, potentially legally. You would have seen for six hours we did not enforce any laws, we showed some discretion and we allowed people to carry on. Dame Cressida added: We knew that it would result in a mass gathering, we knew there would be large numbers, we knew who would come, we knew it would be unlawful.

Here is everything you need to know. Where can I travel in England  As of March , the “stay at home” order has ended, which means you don’t need a specic reason to leave your home. It has been replaced by a message from the government, asking people to “stay local”. But there has been no guidance to clary what this actually means – whether local means five,  or even  miles from your home. The only guidance that has been given is that people should continue to “minimise travel wherever possible and should not be staying away from home overnight at this stage”.  Meanwhile, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said people should minimise travel, but they can still travel in England to see family and friends. He said: “We’re saying that you should minimise travel butyou want to travel to see friends and family then that’s absolutely fine”. Can I travel to Wales or Scotland  Travel to and from Scotland and Wales is only allowedyou have a “reasonable excuse” – so you can’t just go for a holiday. Scottish guidance reads: “Under current Scottish law, given the state of the epidemic, unless you have a reasonable excuse, you must not travel between Scotland and England, Northern Ireland, Wales, Republic of Ireland, Jersey, Guernsey or the Isle of Man.” Meanwhile, the Welsh government says: “Currently, travel in to and out of Wales is not permitted unless you have a reasonable excuse. Reasonable excuses include:to meet other people in your support bubble,you have one to escape a risk of illness or injury, such as for victims or people at risk of domestic abuse to provide or receive emergency services to attend a wedding, civil partnership or funeralyou are invited to vote in an election for elite athletes, to train or compete Can I meet family and friends   As of March , outdoor gatherings of either six people, or two households of any size, is allowed. According to the government, this includes both in public spaces and private gardens. So you can meet friends in family in a park, on the beach, or even in someone’s garden – without breaking the rules.

As such, weaposre sure their nearest and dearest will be keen to celebrate the arrival of their new bundle of joy and theyaposll be inundated with all sorts of fabulous and adorable baby gts. And itaposs likely this time, theyaposll actually be able to keep most of themthey so desire. Previously, as more senior members of the Royal Family, they were unable to accept certain presents given to mark Archieaposs birth, due to protocol. The Royals have strict rules around all gts - including those sent for birthdays, Christmas and anniversaries. The Royal Familyaposs guidelines state: The fundamental principle governing the acceptance of gts by Members of The Royal Family is that no gts, including hospitality or services, should be accepted which would, or might appear to, place the Member of The Royal Family under any obligation to the donor. In this regard, before accepting any gt, careful consideration should always be given, wherever practicable, to the donor, the reason for and occasion of the gt and the nature of the gt itself. Equally, before declining the offer of a gt, careful consideration should be given to any offence that might be caused by such an action. So what werenapost they allowed to accept following Archieaposs birth  The Royal Family are expected to refuse gts from people they donapost knowthere are concerns about the motive behind the gt, or the person who sent it. Similarly, as a general rule, royals are also meant to decline gts sent by a commercial enterprise, such as a shop or fashion designer.  Royal guidelines state that gts sent from outside the UK should normally be refused unless the Foreign and Commonwealth Office or the Commonwealth Secretariat recommends they be accepted. Money given as a gt is also considered to be a big no-no for the famous family, unless they are accepting it on behalf of a charity. The only presents they were allowed to accept were those sent by a public body, including government bodies, trade associations, guilds, civic bodies, the armed services and charities - as long as they were from the UK. Flowers or food might also be acceptable to keep, depending on who sent them, as well as books presented by an author .

Penny Junor said Harry and Meghanaposs accusations of racism and other allegations made in their explosive Oprah interview lobbed a huge bomb into the heart of the institution. The first anniversary of Megxit - when the Queenaposs grandson Harry and former Suits star Meghan stepped down from royal duties and stopped using their HRH styles on March  last year - falls on Wednesday. Ms Junor said: When Harry and Meghan left a year ago people were surprised and disappointed because they were a great pair. Harry was a hugely popular royal and Meghan was a great asset to the family. A year on, I think a lot of people are really angry and think that they have betrayed their family and lobbed a huge bomb into the heart of the institution and sort of taken a swipe at the UK as well. The Sussexesapos two-hour televised sit-down with Oprah Winfrey at the start of this month left the royal family facing one of its worst crises for generations. Meghan said an unnamed royal - not the Queen nor the Duke of Edinburgh - raised concerns with Harry about how dark their son Archieaposs skin tone might be before he was born. The duchess also told how she contemplated suicide but was not supported by the institution even when she begged for help. Harry said he felt let down by his father the Prince of Wales, said he was cut off financially by his family in the months before Megxit, and expressed his shock at his loss of taxpayer-funded security. The interview was aired while Harryaposs grandfather -year-old Philip was in hospital recovering from heart surgery. Ms Junor described the crisis as worse than the abdication of Edward VIII. The circumstances are very dferent. Edward VIII was pushed out, whereas Harry and Meghan chose to leave, but I think this is more damaging, she said. It looked asEdwardaposs abdication was going to damage the monarchy, but in fact, it didnapost because his brother was ready to step into his shoes, and George VI did a really good job and restored the reputation of the monarchy. She added of the Oprah interview: These are really terrible accusations that that will stick. Others came out in support of the Sussexes following the interview.  Bernice King, the youngest child of the late civil rights activist Martin Luther King, tweeted at the time: Royalty is not a shield from the devastation and despair of racism. Tennis star and Meghanaposs friend Serena Williams also backed the duchess, tweeting: Her words illustrate the pain and cruelty sheaposs experienced. I know first hand the sexism and racism institutions and the media use to vily women and people of colour to minimise us, to break us down and demonise us. In the days that followed the interview, US broadcaster Gayle King - a friend of Meghanaposs - revealed that initial talks between Harry and Charles and the Duke of Cambridge were not productive. Ms Junor suggested that Kingaposs disclosure would have an indelible impact on Harryaposs relationship with his family. The fact that the gist of that conversation was broadcast is a terrible betrayal of trust, Ms Junor said.  I donapost know how the whole problem will be resolved because Harry has demonstrated that heaposs not trustworthy, and thatthe royal family make any approach to him,he doesnapost like what they say, the chances are itaposs going to be on global television. The Sussexes, who are expecting their second child - a daughter - in the summer after a miscarriage last year, have embraced their new le in Calornia, away from the monarchy. They have secured lucrative multimillion-pound deals with both Netflix and Spoty, established their philanthropic Archewell foundation, moved into an £ million mansion in Montecito, and Harry has been hired as a chief impact officer for BetterUp Inc, which sells companies employee coaching and mental health help.But the fallout from Megxit and the Oprah interview is far from over. The Queen issued a statement saying that the issues raised would be dealt with privately as a family, but that some recollections may y.

After shocking fans and their own family by announcing their plans to quit in January, the official Megxit date was March . The couple marked the day, which was at the beginning of the Covid pandemic and a week into the UKaposs lockdown, with a goodbye and thank you message on their now defunct Instagram page Sussex Royal. The couple used their social media page to share photos of their charity work and the occasional family photo, however they were forced to close it down when the Queen banned them from using the word aposroyalapos in their branding. Their moving statement spoke about the extraordinarily fragile state of the world and the couple asked fans to take care of themselves and those around them. It also hinted at the non-royal projects they have since announced, by saying were working behind the scenes. They shared a text picture featuring their royal logo, with the words: Thank you to this community for the support, the inspiration and the shared commitment to the good in the world.  The caption read: As we can all feel, the world at this moment seems extraordinarily fragile. Yet we are confident that every human being has the potential and opportunity to make a dference—as seen now across the globe, in our families, our communities and those on the front line—together we can lt each other up to realise the fullness of that promise. What’s most important right now is the health and wellbeing of everyone across the globe and finding solutions for the many issues that have presented themselves as a result of this pandemic. As we all find the part we are to play in this global sht and changing of habits, we are focusing this new chapter to understand how we can best contribute.  While you may not see us here, the work continues. Thank you to this community - for the support, the inspiration and the shared commitment to the good in the world. We look forward to reconnecting with you soon. You’ve been great! Until then, please take good care of yourselves, and of one another. Harry and Meghan. Meghan and Harry now use their new charity organisation, Archewell, to promote their business and charity work.

Gracey Kay, from Leeds, she signed up to OnlyFans - a website where content creators provide exclusive material to their subscribers, or fans” - in the hope of earning some extra cash. Within weeks the -year-oldaposs page proved so popular Gracey made more than twice her annual £, hairdresser income in one month. She has since become one of OnlyFans’ top earners, and has moved with her family to Alicante, Spain, where she plans to invest her earnings into a portfolio of properties.Speaking to Leeds Live, Gracey, who is speaking under her OnlyFans name, said: “I do have to pinch myself sometimes. I can’t believe this is my le. Some days I will just sit on the beach all day and work from my phone. Have you signed up to OnlyFans after losing your job during the pandemic  Email mirrornews@mirror“So far I’ve made ,and by next month I reckon I’ll hit £million. “It’s an unreal amount of money. I think my account became so popular because I started it in lockdown and everyone was online. You can’t do much  at the moment. “I also invested some of the money I made back into promoting my page, so that helped it to grow too.” She continued: “Before, I would never have spent more than £ on a pair of shoes or a handbag. And now I can afford designer things. “But to be honest, I don’t buy myself stuff. I want to use the money for my family and spend it on them once lockdown lts.” Gracey found herself unable to work when the UK was plunged into lockdown in March last year. She found herself with no cash and the bills were mounting up so she turned to OnlyFans after a friend suggested it to her. “I was panicking,” she said.  “I had all these bills to pay and no income. It was stressful. “I’d never heard of OnlyFans before, but my friend said she’d been making extra income by selling feet pictures so, I just thought I’d give it a go.”OnlyFans allows users to create a photo feed like Instagram but also has thefor creators to take private requests.“At first I was very nervous and I only posted underwear pictures because that’s what I was comfortable with,” Gracey said. “But after a while, I started posting nude pictures. I’ve hard to learn about the industry for myself. “I’ve had to work out what content people want to see and what I’m comfortable with.” She added: “It was daunting at first – but now I’ve got one of the most popular pages.” Sharing intimate images has given Gracey more confidence in herself. I’m much more confident now,” she said.  “But that’s the good thing about OnlyFans – thereaposs no size or age limits. “Some of the women I network with are  or  years old – earning just as much,not more than me. “Everyone likes something dferent – some men like petite, some like curvy, some just like feet – everyone has their own thing. “No matter what your size or age, you can be proud of your body and happy with yourself.” Gracey offers everything from explicit pictures, videos, video calls, messaging and custom content. “Sometimes, people will ask for custom stuff that’s just for them,” she said. “We recently bought a Mustang and one of my subscribers loves Mustang cars so heaposs always asking me to take pictures of me in the car. “Fans can privately message me and video call me too. It’s a good way for them to see that itaposs really me behind the pictures and to get to know me.”  Gracey has amassed , subscribers and as she is being followed by so many people she’s faced both good and bad online comments. “Some people don’t like what I do, and I respect that,” she said. “But I thinkyou don’t like something, then you should leave that person alone. “Some people, and it’s a lot of men, have said horrible things online. “Some people have even subscribed to my page, and paid to do so, just to tell me they don’t like what I’m doing.” But the good has outweighed the bad, with Gracey insisting joining OnlyFans has improved her health - thanks to now being able to afford private healthcare – wealth, and lestyle. “Living in Spain means we have the sun  per cent of the time – which is the opposite to the UK,” she said. “So, every weekend, we can do family activities. Not so much at the moment, but when lockdown lts, we’ll be able to.” Now, she’s hoping to invest in the Spanish property market.

Research submitted to ministers reportedly say that the risks of travel would be lessened by a high rate of inoculation together with Covid testing. The analysis claims it would be possible to visit countries with higher rates of infection than were permitted last summer without risking more strain on the NHS. This is said to include most parts of Europe as well as the Caribbean, north Africa and the US. The analysis has reportedly been submitted by Manchester Airports Group to the government task force which is looking at the possibility of foreign travel. The Times reports that ministers are set to meet to discuss plans for vaccine passports and foreign travel. The newspaper reports that they are expected to agree that tests for those entering Britain will stay in place for the long term to track new iants. Currently people face £, fines for travelling abroad without a valid reason, such as for work or to visit a dying relative or attend a funeral. Domestic breaks with multiple households are due to be allowed from May  at the earliest in England.A task force led the transport secretary is analysing the possibility of re-opening international travel, with a report to be handed to Boris Johnson in the coming days. It is not thought that specic dates for foreign travel will be laid out when its findings are published next week. A form of traffic light system is also reportedly a consideration which would see aposredapos countries banned, aposamberapos needing a negative test and a quarantine, and aposgreenapos giving some form of exemption.

Among those who recalled what they saw of the fateful arrest was the teenage girl who filmed the video that sent shockwaves around the world. Struggling with tears the now -year-old said she aposstays up apologisingapos for not doing more after witnessing the shocking scene.Mr Floydaposs death in the US last summer triggered protests around the world as Black Lives Matter demonstrators called for an end to racial injustice in the wake of the unarmed black manaposs death. A trial into his alleged murder got under way on Monday with jurors hearing opening arguments and a number of witnesses. The court was shown a video of Mr Floydaposs last moments as police officer Derek Chauvin knelt on his neck. Chauvin, , denies second-degree murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. His lawyers are set to argue that he followed his training and that the main cause of Mr Floydaposs death - which the county examiner ruled a homicide - was a drug overdose. As the case continued on Tuesday more witnesses recounted what they saw on that fateful day. Here are seven key moments from the second day of the historic case. Alleged killer had aposcold, heartlessapos look Eyewitness Darnella, who filmed the incident, said that the accused aposhad this cold look, heartless.apos She said: He didnapost care what we were saying, it didnapost change anything he was doing.  Recounting what she first saw she told jurors she was walking to Cup Foods with her nine-year-old cousin to buy snacks when she saw a man terried, scared, begging for his le. She claimed officer Derek Chauvin was digging into Mr Floyd’s neck and even pressed “harder” as they pleaded with him to stop. Asked how he was reacting to the public, she said: “If anything, he actually was kneeling harder, looked like he was shoving his knee in his neck. “I feel like he was feeding off our energy. He just stared at us, looked at us. Video of Mr Floydaposs death aposchanged her leapos Darnella was asked by both the prosecution and defence how producing the famous record of Mr Floydaposs death had changed her le. She answered through tears that she did not wipe away, saying she would sometimes stay up late at night thinking of the slain man and apologising to him for not saving his le. Itaposs not what I should have done. Itaposs what he should have done, she said, referring to Chauvin.  When I look at George Floyd, I look at my dad, I look at my brothers, I look at my cousins, my uncles, because they are all black, she said. It could have been one of them. Teen bystander felt aposthreatenedaposDarnella said the only violence was “from the cops” and she described how a firefighter asked Chauvin “multiple times”she could check Floyd’s pulse but the officer “remained kneeling on his neck. Asked why no one in the crowd did anything or tried to get close, she said she felt threatened as the officers “were quick to pull out mace.” When askedshe felt threatened by Chauvin himself, she said: “Yes, he seemed like – how do I word this  I felt like I was in danger when he did that...That’s why I felt threatened. “I don’t understand why the mace was even needed at all.” Ambulance crew had to apospush offapos the officerShe told jurors that when the paramedic arrived Mr Floyd’s pulse was checked while the officer’s knee was still on his neck. Her nine year old cousin went on to give evidence and told how the ambulance crew had to push the officer off Mr Floyd’s neck. She said: “The ambulance had to push him off of him. They asked him nicely to get off of him. He still stayed on him. They just had to pull him off, ‘get off of him’. Asked how it affected her, she said: “I was sad and kinda mad because it felt like he was stopping his breathing and it was kind of like hurting him.” Chauvin aposused knee in a blood chokeapos Earlier, Donald Williams, a -year-old martial arts fighter and father told jurors he believed Chauvin was using his knee in a blood choke on Floyd. The move is from wrestling and is used to knock an opponent unconscious, as well as a shimmy move to tighten pressure on Mr Floydaposs neck. I believe I witnessed a murder, he told the jury. So I felt I needed to call the police on the police.

store open.A number of city organisations were due to meet for the first time today, with a potential support package for staff also on the agenda.Aberdeen City Council business manager Ryan Houghton said: “Today’s meeting is about agreeing a clear strategy with a range of partners including Aberdeen Inspired, the Chamber of Commerce and others for a way forward in persuading John Lewis to change their decision.“The council administration leaders will be looking to find a consensus and to set out the next steps including speaking with the Scottish Government who have indicated their intention to engage on the issue. These efforts will inform the proposals for discussion with John Lewis on Tuesday.”John Lewis announced last week that it is considering the permanent closure of its city store – with around  workers expected to lose their jobs.A petition to keep the store has reached nearly , signatures although John Lewis has said a final decision on the store has yet to be made.Meanwhile, a member of John Lewis staff has said they are “gutted” that the city centre store may not open its doors again.In a letter written to the Evening Express, Eleanor Heptinstall said she hopes bosses can find a way to give the department store’s George Street premises a future.She said: “I am a partner at the John Lewis Aberdeen store –we are all gutted that our store may not open again.“John Lewis Aberdeen plays a key role in attracting shoppers from Aberdeenshire, Inverness, the Highlands  Islands and even Norway to Aberdeen.“Our presence, in turn, assists small businesses, the local hospitality and leisure industries and communities in Aberdeenshire.“I myself moved to Aberdeen to study, as I used to work at Waitrose. What attracted me was being able to move within the John Lewis Partnership, to Aberdeen to assist me through university.“Many students look for a richness in academic quality, shopping destinations, leisure and cultural activities when looking for a suitable university.”“We all hope that the JLP executives change their minds, butnot, we hope we have left a lasting legacy to Aberdeen and that the city revitalises.”Jamie Wishart, head of branch for John Lewis Aberdeen, said: “Our store has been at the heart of the city since , with generations of partners serving our customers in Aberdeen with pride and passion.“I know, having talked to many of our customers over my time here, how dearly loved our shop is and how disappointing news of the proposed closure will be.

Since then the shop on George Street has been my go-to place for quality clothing, homewares, electricals and much more. The customer service is excellent and staff are friendly, competent and very helpful.With the end of lockdown in sight I was really looking forward to a real le shopping trip to John Lewis for some much-needed clothing.Buying clothes online doesn’t do anything for me. I need to see the stuff, feel its quality and try it on – and then enjoy the satisfaction of carrying it home.I’m confident that I’m not alone in this. I also won’t be alone in my disbelief that the last remaining department store in the whole north and north-east of Scotland is going to be taken away from the people who live in the region.Above all my heart goes out to the  staff, and the staff of the seven other John Lewis stores earmarked for closure, who now have to fear for their jobs.The Aberdeen store was once described as successful. After lockdown ends shoppers, allowed and keen to leave their homes again, will .Please, John Lewis Partnership, can you grant your Aberdeen store a grace period until the economy has recovered post-Covid Regina Erich, Willow Row, Stonehaven.Sir, – I am devastated at the news that John Lewis is to close. It is my favourite shop. They fitted my lovely new kitchen in  and were so efficient. I buy my electricals there and other things.It will be a huge loss to the cityit closes. Please plead with them to reconsider.V C Holroyd, Peterculter.Sir, – I was shocked yesterday to hear about the proposed closing of the Aberdeen branch of John Lewis. It would be a devastating loss to the whole area and to Aberdeen city centre in particular.I very much appreciate the goods and services they have provided over the years. I was last in the store just before the Boxing Day closure and cannot imagine our city centre without it.Joyce Plenderleith.Sir, – Whenever I am in town and on George Street I normally visit John Lewis then I might venture to some of the other shops in the area.The same goes vice versa.If in another shop I normally look into John Lewis too. So what I am saying is that this will have a very big effect on the smaller shops in George Street.Donald McPherson, Bucksburn.Sir, – With the closure of John Lewis, the Aberdeen City Council might just as well close the city! There is no reason for visitors or residents north of the central belt to come here any more.With the crippling business rates, the council has overseen the demise of the city.Union Street used to be a lovely street on which to shop, but in the last few years it has deteriorated into an eyesore.Mary Skelton, Inchmarlo, Banchory.Sir, – I was very disappointed to hear of the intended closure of the John Lewis store in Aberdeen.I have been a customer of the store over many years and will miss the knowledgeable, helpful and pleasant staff especially in the electrical and domestic appliances departments – this being more of an issue in Aberdeen as there is now little choice of store where you can get such help and shopping online does not allow for gaining the personal knowledge of the staff.Furthermore with the closure of so many department stores in Aberdeen this would be yet another blow to residents of Aberdeen and the surrounding area.Jacqueline Henderson.Sir, – Like everyone, I was very shocked, saddened and angry at the news that the Aberdeen branch was to close its doors.The impact of this pandemic has been without doubt catastrophic for so many and extremely challenging to say the least. Aberdeen is a wonderful city but to be deprived of its last department store just doesn’t bear thinking about.Whilst online sales are booming, and I certainly do a fair share of my shopping in this way, nothing beats the experience of going into a store to actually see the products and there are plenty of people, particularly an older generation who do not use the internet, and their only option is to have the experience of a day out to the shops.There’s no doubt changes need to be made in many of these large department stores andthey are to try and keep up with the demands of online, they need to make it a really enjoyable shopping experience. John Lewis certainly could do with an overhaul, introduce more interesting brands rather than duplicate ones within their store that were already in standalone stores a stone’s throw away.Their restaurant on the top floor was not the best and did not deliver a high quality of food but could easily replicate the likes of Harvey Nichols, Selfridges or Harrods and introduce branded restaurants into the store, have a champagne drinks bar in another area, offer Prosecco with a manicure pedicure, great tea room with cakes and really just offer a similar experience albeit on a much smaller scale.The question that baffled many people was why Waitrose didn’t go ahead as that would have been a guaranteed success.Plenty to think about but meantime I sincerely hope that something can be doneto save our Aberdeen store and the jobs of all their wonderful staff.Julie Lefevre.Sir, – Yesterday I learned from your web page the sad news of the closure, which prompted me to email the store to ascertain the facts and to explain my disappointment.We have been supporters of John Lewis since the s, from my home city of Nottingham and finally to Aberdeen via London and we have, like many in the last  months, had to resort to online with the intention of ing to the store once le s to normal.The closure of this iconic store in the north-east of Scotland will have an impact on our purchasing as after normality it will not be to John Lewis online but to local retailers we will turn to.The reason is obvious as many products are best bought by sight and touch, coupled with product knowledge. Electrical products from lighting to freezers, clothing, where s become a burden when colours and texture don’t meet expectation, crockery, linen, tableware and cosmetics just to name a few.John Lewis management why did you not give us a chance toto the store before you axed it John Burrows, Pannanich Road, Ballater.Sir, – This is first time ever I have written to a newspaper – I cannot begin to express the devastation I feel at the loss of the John Lewis store.It opened when I was expecting my son and presents for all le’s celebrations, birthdays and Christmas have been purchased there.My -year-old mum died four weeks ago and my last outing with her was to John Lewis so she could buy Christmas gts and have a cuppa and a scone. Can Aberdeen council not be encouraged to provide financial support to this instead of wooden benches on Union Street This will be the nail in the coffin for Aberdeen city centre – please use your social media powers to get all behind this.Anne Boyd.Sir, – For years now shop staff have followed managerial guidelines to inform customers they’d get a better selection of lines online.Too many times have I been told that and replied they were providing nails for their coffin.Seems they have followed guidelines so far now that customers are using the internet to shop as instructed – and look at the high street downfall!Paul Collier, Scott Grove, Belhelvie, Aberdeen.Sir, – Where are our leaders  Are they hiding hoping that everything will blow over and no one will notice their lack of motivation I think so.They are still employed and receiving a wage. The money generated by John Lewis is pivotal in the economy of the city.Do they really think by hiding their heads in the sand that no one will notice their lack of leadership I don’t think so.They should be ashamed by their lack of action. Poor, poor aberdeen what a wonderful city it was.Anne Gibson.Sir, – The closure is a disaster. Along with the loss of Debenhams many of us have lost the opportunity to go to shops where,we are looking for a ‘special’ or just really nice outfit, we had a large range of styles, names and prices to look at, judge the quality of and try on.As we get older we do not have the confidence of the young to shop online for important items. We want to know we can go into a shop, browse and hopefully come out with what we want.As well as that we could have a day out in John Lewis with its massive range of goods and food areas.I cannot believe that there is no longer a single department store in Aberdeen and its greater area. It is so very disappointing.M A Farquharson.Sir, – I completely agree that the loss of John Lewis would be a real death nail to the city centre. We all hear that online shopping has killed the high street but other retailers like Primark are hugely successful without an online presence.I therefore suggest that it is not the case that people only want to shop online. The city centre of Aberdeen has seen a lack of investment for some time.It has not been helped by crippling cuts the city council has had to make due to huge underfunding by the Scottish Government. Business rates directly set by the Scottish Government have been an enormous challenge for business and has driven many previously successful businesses from the city.Karen Shirreffs.Sir, – This is the only department store left in Aberdeen and to close this is the end of our city centre.Helen Madigan.Sir, – Unfortunately the writing has been on the wall for the John Lewis store in Aberdeen’s George Street long before the pandemic came along.And like many other people who would like to save this retail store, the reality is that even more people are doing most of their shopping online because it is safer and more convenient andthe footfall vanishes from a retail store it is unlikely toto the levels of  or  years ago.When chain stores such as Debenhams and John Lewis are no longer viable then they just have to accept the reality and close down loss-making stores and compete online with the rest of the sector.It is a great shame for the hundreds of staff who will lose their jobs at the John Lewis store here in Aberdeen but even with a petition of ,+ signatures, including my own, it is unlikely to change the minds of their directors and management staff.Brian McLeod.Sir, – Though I was half expecting John Lewis Aberdeen to stop trading, it seems like the final nail in the coffin for Aberdeen.I have been a great supporter of the store since its inception being a member of the generation who did the shops every Saturday. Soon it will just be a memory along with EM’s, Falconer’s, Watt and Grant’s and other noble institutions.As a place to visit Aberdeen has been in decline since the s due to poor planning and council leadership.Keeping John Lewis open may just be the start of an upward surge in the retail sector.Liz Jamieson.Sir, – The news of the planned closure of the John Lewis Aberdeen store is devastating, not only for Aberdeen but for the whole of the north of Scotland.It means that there will be no department stores north of the central belt. Yet there will be two John Lewis stores within  miles of each other.Obviously the company will have committed large sums of money to the new store in Edinburgh but one wonders how much they have looked at the impact of the closure of the Debenhams stores in Aberdeen, Dundee and Inverness. It would have left them with a monopoly in the rest of Scotland, the often forgotten part of Scotland, lying outwith the central belt.The news is very disappointing and I will think hard before shopping with John Lewis online or in their remaining stores.There are other online options out there. Hopefully they will reconsider.Jill Miller.Sir, – The proposed closure of John Lewis in Aberdeen seems to be the end-game as far as this city is concerned.From once being a vibrant and busy centre, it has now become a rundown eyesore without any attraction whatsoever, and with the only true department store gone in Aberdeen, the city is slowly dying.From being a city which is richer now than in the s, I cannot understand how successive councils have allowed such deterioration to occur, other than having demanded totally unreasonable monies in rents which clearly is one of the major reasons the city centre is as it is today.If we are to avoid being reduced to a backwater, the council has to start thinking seriously about how to regenerate a city we can be proud of. And the first step is to persuade John Lewis to stay.Patricia Karlstad.Sir, – We now find another major store is pulling out of the city due mainly to lack of support from the community.It may be hard for some to accept this butyou do not support the local stores then they will not run at a loss just to remain in town.Over the years Aberdeen has been slowly declining due to lack of investment. The city council lack experience in attracting businesses to the city.They do not have the foresight to develop a strategy for recovery.Look down south at Newcastle after the demise of the shipyards and coal mining, they turned the local economy around.I appreciate they have in place projects such as Union Terrace Gardens but this will be another white elephant. The council needs to look around at the conditions in the city.We are no longer the oil capital of Europe, those days are long gone.A Riddel, Bridge of Don, Aberdeen.Sir, – John Lewis must stay open.This store has ious departments selling items not available in any other store in the city.If it closes it will also limit our choice for ious products such as electronic equipment, technical items, white goods and so on leaving only one other outlet with the monopoly for these items.These items can be bought online but I personally, like many others, like to see the items I am interested in.It would be a very sad day and a massive loss to the Aberdeen and surrounding communities.Helen Stevenson, Westhill, Aberdeenshire.Sir, – Aberdeen city centre has been dealt yet another disastrous retail blow with the announcement of the closure of the John Lewis store leaving many retail workers nowlooking for alternative retail work where closures are now sadly frequent.There is little doubt that online sales are increasing and encouraged by the Covid- pandemic but high rents and commercial rates have also taken their toll on major retail stores.Aberdeen is suffering this ongoing collapse in retail outlets as are all cities in Scotland but there needs to be a complete rethink of how commercial rates in Scotland have escalated to unaffordable levels and what alternatives need to be considered related to profits rather than property values.Dennis Forbes Grattan, Mugiemoss Road, Bucksburn.Sir, – Here is an idea, clear out the ground floor and install a Waitrose. This would increase foot traffic to the store, the men’s and children’s dept could be distributed throughout the remaining floors displacing some of the under performing sections.George Morrison.Sir, – Very sad to hear of the John Lewis closure. Glad to hear that you are on the case.Everyone with any ideas must come up with the best ideas to stop this now.You are best placed to know who can use their influence. Aberdeen needs to stand united.We need a big store here in Aberdeen for the people of the city and its surroundings.Good luck.Sheila Nicol.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. vw, px\"  "},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2021/03/KFX-240321-01-09_38344761-scaled-e1616593099578-940x564.jpg ","title":"time is of the essence city taskforce to make last ditch effort to keep john lewis in aberdeen","story":".dct-cta@-webkit-keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate@keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate.dct-cta__title.dct-cta__content p.dct-cta__content p:not.dct-cta__content p:last-child.dct-cta__label.dct-cta__input.dct-cta__input::-webkit-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::-moz-placeholder.dct-cta__input:-ms-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::placeholder.dct-cta__label:hover.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__label:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__input:hover,.dct-cta__input:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__btn .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn.dct-cta__btn:disabled.dct-cta__btn:not.dct-cta__btn:not:hover.dct-cta__btn:not:hover,.dct-cta__btn:not:focus.dct-cta__btn-text.dct-cta__btn:before .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn-loadingborder-top:px solid #fffborder-radius:%width:pxheight:pxbox-sizing:border-box-webkit-animation:dctSpinner .s linear infiniteanimation:dctSpinner .s linear infinite.dct-cta--signup.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--signup__dialogs.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--success.dct-cta--signup__dialog--error.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__grid.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and @media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap+.dct-cta__content@supports or.dct-cta__flex:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--js-active.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap,.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and @supports or.dct-cta__grid:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label,.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__gridgrid-template-columns:fr minmaxgrid-gap:.rem .remAberdeen leaders will launch a taskforce in a last ditch effort to convince John Lewis bosses to rethink the closure of the much-loved city department store.High-level talks have taken place between the company’s management and local politicians who want to put “everything on the table” to preserve the retail space and save  jobs.It comes as the John Lewis Partnership confirmed that no final decision on the store#s fate has yet been made, and as a petition to save it was backed by more than , people.Aberdeen Chamber of Commerce chief executive Russell Borthwick warned that “time is of the essence”the city is to “come together as a community” and persuade decision-makers at John Lewis to change their minds.Mr Borthwick said: #We have a choice.#Do we accept the decision is a done deal, that the future of retail is online and pursue other long term uses for our city centre in the hope that the eco-system can still operate without one of its key components, or do we collectively come together as a community to engage with the decision-makers at John Lewis, to convince them to work with us to build a business model that works – I say, the latter.“What do we collectively have in our lockers that could be used to do this #Time is of the essence. Can we be successful in working with John Lewis to convince them to change their minds #Maybe not, butwe do nothing, we already know the outcome.#Special: Your thoughts on the plans to close John LewisCustomers could face six-hour round trip to #nearest store#Aberdeen branch shutsClosure of Illicit Still rubs #salt in the wound# of John Lewis#s planned departureLetter from the editor: Now is the time to make your voice heard and save our city centre tooThe John Lewis Partnership has said it will listen to proposals put forward by city leaders and politicians in an “appropriate consultation process”.A spokeswoman added it was “too early” to discuss details on any plans but said the firm was “actively having conversations with Aberdeen Chamber of Commerce, stakeholders and local politicians”.SNP candidate for Aberdeen Central, Kevin Stewart, also took part in talks with John Lewis management and called for the new taskforce to work to “ensure all opportunities” have been assessed.The proposals are understood to include a new retail space where in the city centre and the potential for a Waitrose supermarket to be added to the George Street space to increase footfall.Mr Stewart said: “The Scottish Government stand ready to assist in terms of redundancies, but as a city, we need to come together and put in place a credible, and politically neutral, taskforce to put everything on the table and ensure all opportunities have been assessed.#New figures show Aberdeen city centre footfall has fallen by more than % during the pandemic, while % of sales at John Lewis have shted online.Adrian Watson, the chief executive of business development group Aberdeen Inspired, said city leaders were “still fighting” to keep the high street giant.Aberdeen City Council co-leader Douglas Lumsden added: “Everyone needs do everything they can to get John Lewis to overturn this decision – I think it’s quite short sighted.“On Tuesday we had the huge announcement from the UK Government on the £ billion investment into the energy sector and the £ million that we’ve committed to the city centre and beach regeneration.“I would have liked to see John Lewis open the store again and seesome of these things would have an impact on the store.“You would like to think that our local economy will bounce back because of that investment.“But it’s clear from what John Lewis said that they are only really interested in the online market in the north-east, and that is regrettable and something we really need to keep on at them to seethey’ll change their mind.”For as

changed for a majority of people in recent years which has led to so many businesses and shops either going to the wall or closing. It’s been on the cards for years, so why the city hasn’t recognised this and adjusted rates accordingly is beyond me.Access to the city has been made an embarrassing farce with the social-distancing measures that were put in place, but even before that, we seemed to discourage people from visiting the city centre rather than encouraging them.With a severe lack of public transport options that other cities benefit from , you’d think we would encourage the use of the car again. Edinburgh, for example, offer free parking on a Sunday, whereas we don’t.In order to attract footfall, ensure businesses stay and to attract new businesses, we need to do something. Firstly, the city needs a severe makeover as it is looking severely run down everywhere you look. Secondly, reduce business rates.From a personal point of view, I don’t want to see the few shops we have left close or go to the wall but, in the same breath, I see it from a business point of view too. Aberdeen has been in decline for many years now, so why would you invest keep throwing money at a city in decline LR.The news PM Boris Johnson could holiday in the Highlands, promoting Scottish tourism, can only be a good thing in this economic climate. I don’t understand why people like coming across as hostile If we do not welcome people across the border and foreign travel is not allowed surely we should be as welcoming as possible for all the small business relying on tourism  No matter what your political point of view it makes economic sense  LS.Regarding Scotland’s - draw with Israel, I wouldn’t panic too much yet. Dropping two points at home in the opener was a blow but Austria are no mugs. A draw away to Israel taken in isolation is a good result.

Options! There is only one possible and that should be obvious.When I first moved to Argyll, driving through Glen Croe was a beautul feeling that I had left the urban areas behind and come out into fresh country. No longer # it is a disaster zone and will remain so for a number of years, and possibly decades,a new  safe road is not built.With the elections in May for the Scottish Government, we should be calling on our  politicians to deliver a suitable road through Glen Croe and to do it soon, not  years  away with no firm plans to do it even then. Our politicians are in hiding and it is time they should deliver.The option should be for a new safe road well away from any landslide so that we, the inhabitants of Argyll, can get back to some normal le.Derrick Anstee, InveraraySir,The neglect of the A is a disgrace.It’s not just the long detour via Crianlarich when it rains heavily, it’s the potholes and ruts when we get a spell of cold weather.Three years ago we had a cold winter and the A became a dirt track. Emergency repairs had to be carried out. The Scottish Government said they’d solved the problem. Now we have another cold winter, and again emergency repairs are needed.Other trunk roads in Scotland don’t get closed when it rains or get all these ruts and potholes in a cold winter.We need serious money invested now to solve the A problems. Yet all we get from the Scottish Government is waffle about y public inquiries.We need money and action now to make the A as reliable as Scotland’s other trunk roads, not more cheap solutions.Councillor Alan Reid, Cowal wardMr Reid is the LibDem candidate for May#s Scottish parliamentary electionSir,With reference to theto school, I do hope that the pupils in Lochgilphead Joint Campus are kept in at lunchtime instead of being allowed to roam the streets like herds of wildebeast, with absolutely no social distancing or the wearing of masks.There is a perfectly good ing canteen restaurant in the school and or packed lunches.There is no need, at this time, for them all to be out and crowding supermarkets, fast food shops, cafes and chippies.This needs to be addressed by the Argyll and Bute education department as soon as possible.Name and address suppliedSir,In a leaflet delivered to every home in the Argyll and Bute constituency, Conservative MSP Donald Cameron claims that the #UK Governmentannounced the Argyll and Bute Rural Growth Deal worth £ million# and goes on to say that he is working with local councillors #including Alastair Redman# to #see what further action is needed#.The Rural Growth Deal, however, is a joint project involving £ million from the Scottish Government and a matched sum from the UK Government as well as more than £ million from other sources.In addition the deal has its origins in discussions between the Argyll and Bute MSP Michael Russell, then Scottish Government Finance Secretary John Swinney and the former leader of Argyll and Bute Council, Dick Walsh, in February . The UK Government only became involved some years later.This would be a very serious attempt at disinformation were it not so ludicrously self-defeating. Mr Cameron is standing to be a member of the Scottish Parliament yet he is trying to airbrush out anything Scottish about the largest investment ever in Argyll and Bute and its future.I hope it is merely ignorance of what has happened here that has led him to so severely misrepresent the truth of the issue, becauseit is political spin then he needs to apologise and withdraw the leaflet.Being pictured next to Alastair Redman won#t help him either, given that Mr Redman is best known for his regular letters to local papers attacking the very Scottish Government that is putting an extra £ million into this area.The Scottish Tories need to decide who they are working for # Boris Johnson in London, or the people of Scotland.Until Mr Cameron sorts his loyalties out, then he can#t be regarded as any sort of contender for the privilege of representing the people of Argyll and Bute.Michael Russell MSPSir,The SNP has committed £, to prepare for a second referendum within the next year.Instead of being focused on Scotland’s vaccination programme and protecting people’s jobs, the SNP’s priority is holding another isive referendum as early as this year.Setting aside this vast sum of money to help preparations for a referendum shows the SNP’s commitment toScotland to the politics of ision all over again.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward"},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast episode 20 the final tee","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Not before time.I was supportive of the mitigation plan, using nets and catch pits, as the simplest and least expensive approach. It was certainly worth a try, but it is abundantly clear now # with reputedly £ million spent # that it is not working.The , tonnes or more poised to come down on the road may well be an underestimate, and recent closures of the OMR, despite the new bund, doesn’t say very much for the efficacy of the protection. So we need an alternative, and we need it soon, not  years away.Talk of #alternative traffic corridors# is just a distraction.There may well be a case for a bridge-and-tunnel approach. Such has been successful in Norway and # notably # both in Iceland and Faroe Islands, which have much smaller resource bases than Norway. But these would be long-term schemes, each requiring the completion of several major interlinked crossings, for the like of which Scotland’s roads authority has hitherto shown neither interest nor aptitude.The problem at the Rest is a local one which requires a local solution. It’s only a mile or so of road which is at issue there.The alternatives, realistically, boil down to three:Overhead protection might well be required over quite a long distance, as it’s not just the bit at the catch pits which is threatened. The slopes of the Cobbler have experienced slides too. Since the hillside ies it might not be possible to use standard prefabricated modules, and in any case installation work would close the A for some time.A tunnel through to Butterbridge could be driven quite quickly # particularlythe Norwegians did it # but the approach in upper Glen Croe would require protection just like the OMR. Sir William Lithgow’s proposal mentions this, but construction would also almost certainly close the OMR, leaving no ersion for that period.The construction of a new alignment up the south west side of the glen, however, either on or roughly parallel to the existing forestry road, would avoid interference with through traffic.Both the gradient and the transverse slope would be substantially similar to those of the existing A, though thewould be marginally greater, which is probably why the north east side was chosen when the #new# A was built.The core of the case for the third option, however, is that the south west side of the glen has experienced far less erosion, both historically and in recent years, than the north east one.Stand at the upper viewpoint, or better still a little way along the Lochgoilhead road, and look around. The slopes of Ben Luibhean on which the A runs show far more watercourses and gullies than any of the others in the vicinity.This indicates a lot more rainfall impacting that slope, probably by the prevailing weather being funnelled on to it through the pass at the top of Glen More. And that weather is becoming worse.There have been no major slips over the forestry road in recent years, despite a spate of them on the opposite slope. It may just be the trees. I don’t think so, but in any case the trees are there, while it would take some years for tree cover to established above the A.Going back a lot further in time, the pattern is the same. The burn in the floor of upper Glen Croe has been pushed, over the centuries, by slip debris coming down from the north east slope, and the depth of that debris can easily be seen in the gullies recently carved in it behind the new bund.There is also a fair number of impressively-sized boulders on the lower slopes on that side, which at some point rolled down the hillside. Some of these came from the Cobbler, and although most are below the road a few are not. There is nothing to say that more will not arrive.A further point is that while the lower slopes on each side of the upper glen are similar, those on the south west side ease off towards the top, while those on the NE slope do not.It is on these upper slopes that the small slips develop which can pick up more and more water and debris on their way down, hence the fan shape of the typical slip. There is, in other words, a lot less potential for the initiation of slips on the south west side.I think that this all points to the need for a serious look at the forestry road, and I fail to understand why the investigations a few years ago dismissed it as a viable alternative.It’s the existing A which isn’t viable. And why any of these solutions would take  years to complete also beats me. Local objections  There is only one house in upper Glen Croe, and in the rest of Argyll I have yet to meet anyone who doesn’t want a permanent solution.My suspicion is that the biggest dficulty is that Transport Scotland can’t yet find a way to explain how £ million could be spent to such little effect. I might, of course, be wrong in all this, but I wait to be convinced of it.Arthur Blue, ArdrishaigSir,Since the temporary repairs to the Rest are clearly getting nowhere and costing money into the bargain, I would like to suggest a radical solution to the problem, and that is to build a viaduct right down the centre of the valley, based on the design of the MillauFor those not familiar with this structure, it is well worth an internet search. I believe this is still the world#s tallest bridge and is a really beautul structure.Seen from a distance, the white deck and piers look quite unreal # moreBefore anyone asks where that sum of money is to be found, I would point out that Boris Johnson#s proposed tunnel to Northern Ireland may cost between £ billion and £ billion # nobody knows because it hasn#t been designed yet. Nevertheless, Alister Jack is extremely enthusiastic about the proposal, so clearly money is not a problem.Not only would this new viaduct solve the problem once and for all, I suspect that, like the Millau Viaduct, it would become a much-photographed tourist attraction.John McCall, LochgilpheadSir,In last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser, Councillor Alastair Redman criticises the SNP for setting aside £, of its own money to campaign for an independent Scotland.Not surprisingly, he fails to enlighten us as to the costs of  the Tory party#s #Union Unit# set up by the Prime Minister at the taxpayers# expense.David Hay, MinardSir,Due to the speed with which the NHS is carrying out its vaccination programme, there is hope that we can soon all get out again andto normal.We still, however, face huge challenges. The economy has suffered. The NHS faces a big backlog of cancelled operations. Our young people have a lot of schooling to catch up on. We don’t have much time left to stop our climate changing before it is too late.Here in Argyll the Scottish Government must rise to the challenge of building a permanent solution at the Rest and Be Thankful.These must be our priorities. We can’t afford to spend the next few years arguing over independence.

The vaccination process carried out with great economy and efficiency # and entirely painlessly so that we really will have to stop calling it #the jag#.The real bonus was the warmth and good humour from everyone involved that made the whole process welcoming, so that you left with a smile on your face. Only after the event do you realise what a tremendous team effort it was from everyone involved and all of them deserve our thanks.I hope very much that the Mid Argyll area makes a near  per cent response to the vaccination invitation, because that is what this effort deserves and will demonstrate to those involved the very real, genuine appreciation we have for their work during the pandemic.Norman Rea, Kintallen, TayvallichSir,The rank hypocrisy of the Scottish Tories knows no bounds.While they are frothing at the mouth that the first minister should resign over allegedly misleading the Scottish Parliament, at the same time Prime Minister Johnson was proven to have deliberately misled the Westminster parliament.Standing up in the House of Commons, Mr Johnson stated that all Covid-related contracts were #on the record#.This was three days after the High Court ruled the government had acted unlawfully by failing to publish hundreds of such contracts, which somehow seemed to find their way to those with Tory party connections.Two weeks prior to this, the Health Minister Matt Hancock was found guilty of illegal activity by the High Court, refusing to resign or even apologise when the extent of illegal awarding of PPE contracts was revealed.Last year Tory Home Secretary Priti Patel was found guilty of breaching the ministerial code by being a bully and shouting and swearing at civil servant employees in the Home Office, recently reaching a £, settlement with the former Home Office Permanent Secretary.Compare and contrast that with north of the border, where the Tory party has demanded the resignation of the first minister even before the outcome of the enquiries into the handling of the Alex Salmond case by the Scottish Government has been published.Not a cheep from them demanding an apology, let alone a resignation, for the flagrant abuses by their Westminster colleagues. What hypocrites.Alex Orr, EdinburghSir,This Mother’s Day, school feeding charity Mary’s Meals would like to pay tribute to incredible women around the world.From the mums in the UK whose food has nourished us throughout our childhoods, including those who volunteer and fundraise for Mary’s Meals, to the women who cook and serve our daily meals for children in some of the world’s poorest countries, we celebrate them all.Mary’s Meals feeds more than . million hungry children in  countries every school day.That’s why I am asking your readers to send a Mary’s Meals gt card to the special women in their lives this Mother’s Day.

We cannot thank them enough.But the fallout from Covid- is going to pose challenges for everyone in health and social care. Our Recoveries at Risk report last autumn highlighted the real le impact of the pandemic on people recovering from a stroke.Emerging evidence of links between Covid- and stroke means that now, more than ever, a renewed national focus on stroke is needed in Scotland.Health officials have been working during the pandemic to review evidence and define what #a progressive stroke service for Scotland# should look like.This will include improved stroke care bundle figures, improved stroke prevention measures, a national thrombectomy service and stroke-specic, person-centred rehabilitation.The charity is pleased that people affected by stroke will be included in the development of this work.A draft paper will be with the Scottish Government in the next few weeks. Whatever the outcome of May’s election, the Stroke Association in Scotland expects the next government to push this work on, and for a new, improved, progressive stroke service to be implemented.Colin Oliver, public affairs officer, the Stroke Association in Scotland"},{"url":null,"title":"argylls abigail releases debut single","story":"Fiona ScottUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Firstly, due to the obvious genre dferences but also because I’ve always had the support of five other people to make key choices, so it’s been a big change making decisions by myself on how I want the music to sound.#I have really enjoyed the process and the musical independence recording the single has given me.#Originally from rural Argyll, Abigail grew up with music very much at the heart of her family learning fiddle from a young age, also being taught guitar and vocal stylings at home with her father. She joined Heron Valley in its infancy while also studying at Royal Conservatoire of Scotland Junior School.As well as touring extensively with Heron Valley, Abigail went on to graduate from The Royal Conservatoire of Scotland where she studied Scots Song and classical violin. Her unique music style and honest song writing make Abigail an exciting prospect for the Scottish music scene and Lady a much-anticipated release.Lady will be available to download and stream from Friday March ."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column march 12 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

As many examples as possible will then also be published in the Campbeltown Courier, Argyllshire Advertiser and Oban Times newspapers.The artwork, which must be created specically for this showcase, can be on any surface # as long as it can be photographed and submitted # but it is limited to one image per person. It is not a competition and none of artwork will be judged.Gigha-based youth work facilitator Kenny Wilson, one of the project#s organisers, explained: #As youth workers, we kept hearing the same phrases from young people, phrases like #My bedroom has become my classroom# and #I feel like the walls are closing in on me#. Young people were asking questions like #Where can we go # Nowhere. #Who we can meet # No-one. #What are we allowed to do # During lockdown, very little at all.#The idea is to give artistic young people something to do that#s not prescribed by the Curriculum for Excellence [Scotland#s education framework] or by the government to give them the freedom to choose what they want to do, to design whatever they want to design.#The reward will be seeing their artwork published online and in the newspapers. The purpose of the whole thing is to increase the wellbeing of young people, to give them a boost # it#s as simple as that.#He added: #It could well be that something catches the eye of someone in the wider artistic community and they could be put in touch with the young creator of the piece in question # but that would have to be arranged through the youth workers, subject to careful child protection measures, and with parents# consent.#Kenny explained that safeguarding is an essential part of all that youth workers do and, as such, the organisers have created a GDPR statement which reads: #We will ensure that all personal data that we collect will only be held until all the images have been showcased, and will be processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner and only collected for the legitimate purposes of the showcase, and will never be passed on to any other organisation or third party without your explicit permission.#Those who would like to register an interest in taking part, can email ayelovetomake@gmail providing their first name and location. They are not required to submit their surname, full address or age, as long as they are within the  to  age range.When the project officially launches on Friday March , they can then send photographs of their artwork to the same email address so it can be uploaded to the project#s Instagram account, where it will be made visible to the public after the Sunday April  closing date.Kenny added: #If you are a young person with a desire to create, then go for it!#"},{"url":null,"title":"heathers treks renaissance ruins and ancient rock art","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

She has travelled and trekked throughout the world, walked across Scotland numerous times, climbed many of its peaks and now lives in Argyll amongst the scenery she loves.Lovely Kilmartin Glen is host to many wonderful historic sites and ancient monuments.Overlooking its northern reaches the renaissance remains of Master John Carswell’s Carnasserie Castle stand proud, its ruins eerily dramatic despite now being more home to crow than human.There are many ways in which to explore the area. This circular takes you through time from Carnasserie Castle in the east to the prehistoric rock art at Ormaig in the west, before wending southwards on the path used in bygone days to reach Old Poltalloch. Then, turning east, you come to Lady’s Seat, which offers lovely views down the glen, a brief respite before turning northwards toto the castle’s realm. Glimpses over to Loch Craignish and down Kilmartin Glen give one time to ponder the geology of the area swept by the glaciers of the last ice age.At the car park you will see a small path exiting the NE corner by the information boards. Turn left and head up the track towards the castle. You initially come to a turning left, you will take this shortly. Meanwhile the castle lies just ahead, through a gate and up a steep path to your left. Currently you can but admire its grandeur from the outside, either from here or the next section of the walk .Return to the track and take the turn on your right SW up through the trees and to a gate. Ahead you will cross the field for m, with the castle to your right, before re-joining the farm track. Follow it to a T-junction .Turn right and continue up the field and through a gate. A young forestry plantation lies to your left, pretty and convoluted little hills and glens to your right. Effectively the valley floor is the line of a dyke with the lumps, bumps and ides a mixture of limestone, igneous rock intrusions, sandstones, gritstones, conglomerates and folding doing much to create the complex NE SW flow seen in the shape of the hills and lochs all carved out by glaciers.Follow the track over the col past a gnarly old plantation on a knoll. The route descends for km towards Loch Craignish before veering sharply right to cross the Eas Mor burn at its western end. Note the main track you come on to. For those wishing to miss the path to Old Poltalloch you will need toto this point and keep following it south east to join up with the rest of the route.Cross the bridge over the Eas Mor. Ignore the small path to your right with a barrier and continue for m look out for the new track signposted up to the prehistoric rock art of Ormaig. After ascending m you will see the little paths to your right leading to the stones, a good place to pause and wonder at those who carved them.Return to the track below and south over the Eas Mor. At the sharp left-hand bend turn immediately right towards the sea. After just m, opposite a ruined croft, an easily missed path slips down to a wall. As soon as you are on it, it is obvious and now wends its way southwards towards Old Poltalloch through the ‘Big Wood’.The path is boggy in places with the odd fallen tree. After .km it reaches a forestry road turn left and follow this for m to a sharp left-hand bend. The path goes straight ahead at the bottom of the bend just below a turning point, again it is not obvious until you are on it. Continue to follow this all the way until you reach the road at Old Poltalloch, passing farmstead ruins and the old walled garden on your right. The house itself has now been renovated.Turn left. The track, which also leads to a jetty below, climbs upwards for nearly km before reaching the col leading to Kilmartin Glen. Ignore the two tracks you pass on your left .Descend for m and take the grassy forestry track to your right. After m a path leads upwards on your right to Lady’s Seat, a worthy detour for a grand view over the glen.Return to the track and turn right to descend to the main track below . Cross straight over, through a gate to the right of some sheep pens. Passing a track from your right after mzigzag down through the woods to a gate. The track does a sharp -degree turn right and, a little after, turn left to follow the tracks back to Carnasserie and your earlier outward route.Please note: Historic and Environment Scotland properties and sites remain closed due to Covid the castle can only be viewed from the outside at this time.

How could they turn so quickly  Where was their integrity Some just followed the crowd others feared Jesus was challenging the accepted order, so better get rid of him for the greater good.If we face betrayal, injustice, double standards, how do we react  Revenge, get our own back  That is a very natural reaction, but the consequence is to prolong the bitterness, perhaps ramp up the situation.Jesus asks us to step back, to #turn the other cheek# , to suck up the injustice, the double standards, and let peace rule.Impossible  Well, that is what He did at the cross, and because of Him, I think it is possible.I don#t always get it right in my le, but #don#t do as I do , do as He tells you#.

But two thirds of women are diagnosed late, when the cancer is harder to treat.This March, for Oian Cancer Awareness Month, I’m writing to ask your readers to take just two minutes of their time to learn the symptoms and spread the word to their families and friends.The main symptoms of oian cancer are: persistent bloating, feeling full or having dficulty eating, tummy pain, and needing to wee more often or more urgently.If you believe in a future where every woman diagnosed with oian cancer has the best chance of survival, please show your support and visit www.targetoiancancer.org.uk MarchSarah Greene, Target Oian Cancer PatronSir,We welcome the latest announcement from the Scottish Government that communal worship can potentially resume from March  with the possibility of up to  people in attendance, assuming physical distancing of two metres can be in place.Christians are Easter people we live with hope in all circumstances, and the church will be providing guidance to congregations to help them ensure that buildings are re-opened in a safe and responsible manner.While some congregations will adopt a cautious approach regarding the reopening of our buildings # and others won#t have the practical means to do so # everyone will be very glad at this news and will already be looking forward to how most appropriately to celebrate Easter .In whatever we do, we#ll be remembering that the God who raised Jesus from the grave has been faithful to us throughout the whole of this last year.Rt Rev Dr Martin Fair, Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of ScotlandSir,The first Citizens’ Assembly of Scotland has submitted its final report to the Scottish Parliament, with its  powerful democratic recommendations aimed at improving the wellbeing of Scotland#s people and governance.I personally would have loved to be a participant in this new democratic exercise, meeting and sharing with, speaking and listening to, a wide range of our people, many very unlike me and with very dferent perspectives, opinions and lived experience.To be informed by a range of expert, evidence-based perspectives, to explore and discuss implications and reservations, and to move towards a rough consensus on a range of key questions that will affect ourselves, our children and grandchildren, and that will shape the future of our country – that’s the exemplar of the active, responsible citizen of st century Scotland.There#s a climate assembly also currently working towards its conclusions, and I await its recommendations with interest and anticipation.Recommendation six of the first assembly is: #That in order to ensure that citizens can make informed decisions in relation to rebuilding their communities the Scottish government and parliament should: establish community-based citizens# assemblies to assess what is happening in our communities , identy gaps and recommend actions, including through digital technology, that can bring people together and make our communities more inclusive.#We have a Scottish election coming up in May, and I hope to see a good turnout as a good majority of Scotland’s electorate, from age  upwards, make sure to vote in this most critical exercise of our moment of power and responsibility.Subsequently, I hope to very soon look forward to a renewed interest in local democracy, as an Argyll and Bute Citizens# Assembly debates and decide the shape of Argyll and Bute#s future for the coming decisive decade.Perhaps that future will include enhanced interest and participation in some version of our current powerless and voiceless community councils.Mary MacCallum Sullivan, Ardrishaig"},{"url":null,"title":"longing for a rest","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

This is mainly due to massive insecticide use and habitat loss caused by intensication of agriculture.Up to  per cent of flowering plants and  per cent of commercial crops require insects for pollination, with honeybees and hoverflies most often doing the job.But with declining numbers of these species, farmers may employ hives of bees to prevent crop yields falling.Wild honeybees forage within three miles of their nest, and onthey perform the #waggle dance# that advertises the location of productive foraging sites to other bees. Also, odours from scented flowers picked up inside the nest while unloading pollen act as cues to guide nest-mates to specic flowers.Now scientists have articially imprinted bees with flower odours in an attempt to improve crop yields*.In trying to establish long-term memory for flower odours, the scientists offered bees in three separate groups of hives alternative odours:  sucrose solution scented with synthetic sunflower odours,  sucrose solution scented with jasmine odours,  sucrose solution alone. They then relocated the hives to a sunflower plantation and compared the foraging activities of bees exposed to the three solutions.First, scientists decoded waggle dances to identy sunflower-specic dances. Using this information, they observed bees from hives fed with sunflower odours performing sunflower dances one hour after hive relocation.Contrastingly, the control bees fed jasmine odours took - hours and control sucrose-fed bees took  hours to perform sunflower dances.This resulted in the sunflower odour-imprinted bees performing signicantly more sunflower-specic waggle dances during the first day of relocation, peaking at  per cent increase over control hives preferentially visiting sunflowers and bringing in more sunflower pollen loads than the control bees.The scientists then measured the all-important crop yields in five plots containing dferent sunflower hybrid plants pollinated by sunflower odour-imprinted compared to control bees.Seed yields in all five plots were highest when pollinated by sunflower odour-fed bees, with increased production up to  per cent above control bees.They conclude that providing bees pre-programmed to forage on specic crops could circumvent wild pollinator shortages and signicantly increase crop yields.*Current Biology , -.

Especially when option one, the Glen Croe route, was the chosen option from the A Trunk Road Study # summary report published by Jacobs in .Surely, after nine years of consulting, the Scottish Government and Transport Scotland can choose the best solution rather than going through a y and expensive consultation process.Based on this, our members would like the permanent solution fast tracked, which is well within the Scottish Government’s power and we would ask for this to be seriously considered.Our other comments and feedback to last week’s announcement are as follows:The timber road route should be upgraded as a short-term solution this summer and not in the suggested  months.Argyll businesses have faced the issues of landslides for many years. However, the situation has worsened over the past year and in our opinion it has now become a national emergency and requires immediate action.The , tons of unstable material could swamp any further mitigation measures put in place on the A and Old Military Roadand make the roads impassable. This could easily happen when we next have an extended period of rainfall.Savings in further mitigation work could go towards upgrading the forestry road.The long-term solution should be selected from the  The A Trunk Road Study and based on the delivery of the most sustainable outcome.Any well-developed permanent solution needs to be open  without fear of being buried under tons of rock and mud, and will have less environmental impact than the landslides, catchpits, netting and OMR bund we are currently experiencing.Our understanding of costs and timescales from similar schemes in Norway show a tunnel could be built in three years at a cost of £-m, and not the £-m stated by Transport Scotland.Members of The RABT Campaign group represent a cross section of business sectors and we would welcome the chance to meet with your officials to discuss how we might help cut through the y timescales and fast-track decision making.John Gurr  Sir,I heard that there was work going on in Lochgilphead town centre, and that some people were complaining, about mess and upheaval.

In this instalment, we spoke to Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross.Q. What is your party planning to do for the Borders, in particular A. We are very keen to see voices across Scotland heard, because I think after the last  years of the SNP being in charge we have seen decisions taken that suit the central belt of Scotland, but not the south of Scotland.Areas such as Peeblesshire have largely been ignored. I said when I became leader of the Scottish Conservatives, probably because I represent an area outwith the central belt, I want to make sure that the voices of communities that havenrsquot been heard are finally heard in the Scottish Parliament.With a local candidate like Shona Haslam, we have got an excellent local advocate who is passionate about the local community, who will drive for more local services to be delivered locally and more investment for local communities.I have done a lot about ensuring carer funding for local authorities, recruiting new teachers right across the country, investing in businesses to protect peoplersquos jobs and I think as we come out of this pandemic, itrsquos really important that the focus of the Scottish Parliament and every MSP is on recovery and rebuilding after the most dficult  months we have had ndash rather than the SNPrsquos plans for another referendum.Q. We have run stories about local businesses being hurt by the impact of Brexit. What assurances can you give them A. I donrsquot underestimate the challenge that businesses have faced and those who have raised concerns directly with me, I have treated them really seriously and wersquove got to resolve them.I welcome the fact that there was a compensation scheme, particularly for fishing.The pound million was important, but I said at the time that wonrsquot be enoughwe still have the underlying problems with added bureaucracy and delays in getting produce out to Europe.From the conversations I have had, there have been improvements, but there are still challenges that we have got to navigate.Thatrsquos why Lord Frost has been appointed to look at these issues in detail and get them resolved so we can have a far smoother process.That means reducing the number andof forms, the bureaucracy that there is and allowing businesses to do what they do best which is getting our great produce out and into the European Union market.Q. Scottish Borders Council has declared a climate emergency. What are the Scottish Conservatives doing in terms of the climate A. I think the climate  the environment  the green agenda will go through all partiesrsquo manestos over the next few weeks, because the UK is hosting the COP conference in Glasgow.Itrsquos a real opportunity for us to showcase to the whole world the s Scotland has gone to with renewable energy and the progress wersquove made in terms of development of new, renewable technologies and the investment we can make. We saw the budget a couple of weeks ago put in considerable investment.I think it was pound million into the north east for a transition from the traditional oil and gas into a green transition.Itrsquos important that we recognise the environment as a key issue in this election, for particularly young people, but voters of all ages and thatrsquos why the green agenda will be woven through our partyrsquos manesto and itrsquos a top priority for us going into these elections.Q. Why do you think your party, traditionally, hasnrsquot been as successful in Scotland as it has in England A. If you just look at the last few election campaigns, we have made signicant gains. In the  election we more than doubled the number of our MSPs and it was because the Scottish Conservatives more than doubled in size that we prevented the SNP from getting a majority and prevented them holding another independence referendum.Itrsquos absolutely clearwersquore to stop the SNP again, only by using votes for the Scottish Conservatives can people be assured of that outcome.We have made progress at every election in recent years, both at Holyrood, Westminster and local authorities and we are clearly the strongest challengers to the SNP right across the country.I donrsquot put a limit on my ambitions for the party. Wersquove got great local candidates like Shona [Haslam] and great representatives like David Mundell. People can see that the Conservatives deliver for the communities they represent.Readersrsquo questions Q. If everyone apart from you voted for the SNP, would you still refuse to back another independence referendum A. I am a Scottish Conservative and Unionist, so I will never support another independence referendum. I think the ision that caused in our country in  is still in our society right now. Itrsquos damaging.But we are still dealing with a global pandemic and we will be dealing with the effects of COVID- on our economy for years to come.It is the height of irresponsibility for the SNP to say they are going to push ahead with another independence referendum, rather than focus on our recovery rebuilding as a country and mending the ision that has distracted Scotland for so long.Q. What is your opinion of the allegations of lsquochumocracyrsquo over the awarding of PPE contracts by the UK Conservative government A. These things are all investigated by the Public Accounts Committee in the UK Parliament, which is chaired by a member of the opposition who will look into these details.The Cabinet Office will also look into it. I think overall wersquove got to look at how the country responded to COVID- and in terms of getting PPE into the country at a vital time and ensuring our NHS is not overwhelmed when we saw other countries in Europe such as Spain and Italy seeing their NHS overwhelmed.Wersquove seen an outstanding roll-out of the vaccination programme. Thatrsquos only been possible here in Scotland because the UK Government procured and developed vaccines at an early stage in the pandemic.And wersquove seen the support in terms of the furlough scheme to protect almost one million jobs in Scotland, the support for self-employed, and the support for businesses.All that has been possible because of the strength of the United Kingdom. Thatrsquos the area that most people focus on in terms of the COVID pandemic with me ndash just how we have all worked together during the most dficult  months where the sacrices people have made wouldrsquove been unimaginable a year ago.I think we can see light at the end of the tunnel and one day this will all be a very bad and distant memory.Q. As a Westminster MP, why are you calling for a vote of no confidence in the leader of another parliament [Nicola Sturgeon], when the UKrsquos [Conservative] home secretary has broken the ministerial code and the health secretary has acted unlawfully *Please note: Our interview with Mr Ross took place on Friday, March . Since then, a vote of no confidence in Ms Sturgeon has been held ndash it failed by - .

Welcoming the reportrsquos findings, Ms Sturgeon said: ldquoMr Hamilton has considered all of the allegations against me, and I am happy that his reportrsquos findings clear me of any breach of the ministerial code.A. Because I am the leader of the main opposition party in Scotland and itrsquos the role of the leader of the opposition party to scrutinise the conduct of the Scottish Government, ministers and First Minister.We have seen in the evidence to the parliamentary enquiry that Nicola Sturgeon has breached the ministerial code, she has misled parliament and there is no way anyone can continue as First Minister having misled parliament.Itrsquos my role as leader of the main opposition party to highlight that and I believe there is a strong case that Nicola Sturgeon should resign."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-peeblesshire-test-sites-operate-next-week","story":"THREE places in Peeblesshire will be among the next Borders sites offering tests to people without coronavirus symptoms.On March , NHS Borders announced that new community testing centres would be rolled out across the region.And on Tuesday , the health board revealed that fire stations in Peebles, Innerleithenand West Lintonwill be offering tests next week.:Heroin offences: Peebles man sentenced after admitting pair of drugs crimesNHS Bordersrsquo director of public health, Dr Tim Patterson, said: ldquoThe more we know about COVID-and where it currently is the better able we will be to contain it and limit its spread throughout our communities.ldquoAlthough cases in the Borders are low at present, there are still cases out there.

His aunt stopped the role play with a serious look on her face.ldquoA heart-rending cry was heard, she said. ldquoA brave but young MacLaren warrior had been cut down at his fatherrsquos side.

Finn joined her.ldquoAye, no mercy was given, none were spared. The last two made a desperate attempt to escape by crossing the river over there. They were chased and both met their end, the last one at a place called Sron Lainie which we passed earlier.Izzy sat back down by the hearth and cradled her mug of coffee.ldquoEver since that battle, this rock has been the rallying point for the MacLaren clan, and Creag an Tuirc their war cry.Finn stood like a victorious warrior, stick in hand, looking out at the scene of the battle.

Who knows what he must have felt inside at all the death people said hersquod caused.Finn raised his voice with passion: ldquoBut he didnrsquot cause it, the stupid bullies did! He didnrsquot tell about what happened because he wanted to hide his humiliation. He was hurt and being bullied. How was he to know this would happen Izzy nodded: ldquoI think yoursquore right Finn ndash the bullies just used it as an excuse. But sometimes people feel guilt even when they arenrsquot really to blame.Finn nodded as he scanned the landscape, then swiped his stick against the trunk of a tree so hard the stick broke in two.ldquoIs it a true story aunty Izzy got up and stood by him: ldquoThere is disagreement about when it happened, but it is a traditional tale long told and seems based on real events, but who can say for sure.Finn looked at his aunt: ldquoI wish I could speak to him and explain it wasnrsquot his fault.ldquoMe too, said Izzy. She laid her hand gently on his arm. ldquoMaybe someone did.

He threw the empty plastic bottle into the undergrowth.ldquoYou said there was a mystery about Rob Royrsquos grave, can you tell me that too ldquoSure, replied Izzy, ldquoafter yoursquove put that bottle in our bag for rubbish, you know better than that Finn.Finn settled by the hearth and Izzy looked at her nephew, wondering where to start.ldquoThe thing is, she said, ldquoI believe Rob Royrsquos grave probably isnrsquot really the grave of Rob Roy!Finn laughed: ldquoWhat  How can you say that His aunt told how the story in the glen was that Rob had been wounded in a sword fight with a man called John MacLaren, with whom he had had a dispute over land. It was Robrsquos last fight and the wound he received eventually caused his death.She explained that it was said his body was then carried along a coffin trail which went over the hills to the west of the glen at a place called Bealach nan Corp, which means pass of the corpses.The trail led to the shore of Loch Lomond, the earlier home of Rob Roy, then to an island called Inchcailloch where many of his ancestors are buried.ldquoIt was common for dead people to be carried many miles to their ancestral burial ground, Izzy explained, ldquobecause resting with your ancestors was important in clan culture. Thatrsquos why there are so many coffin trails all over the Highlands.ldquoYou mean paths to carry dead people to graveyards ldquoYep.ldquoBut what about the gravestone at his grave here  asked Finn.ldquoThat stone is very old and lay in the kirk long before Rob was even born, it commemorates a warrior lost to memory, most likely a MacLaren. The MacLaren clan was the first to hold sway here.ldquoThe gravestones claimed to be of Rob and his family lie in the foundations of the oldest church, which was associated with the MacLarens even before the MacGregors arrived in this glen. Using old gravestones did happen, but I think Rob will have wanted to rest with his ancestors.Finn was confused: ldquoSoitrsquos not really his grave, why would anyone say it is Izzy pointed towards the south.ldquoAlthough Rob was well known in his letime, after his death he was turned into a famous legend by the historical novels of a man called Walter Scott. Wealthy tourists came here in droves in the th century, on horse and cart, then later by train. They wanted to see the places described in the book just as people do now with films.ldquoLike the phone box from Local Hero, proclaimed Finn.ldquoExactly. It became a romantic pilgrimage and pilgrims need a shrine to visit. So I think someone began the story that those old gravestones marked Rob and his familyrsquos graves, then later the story caught on and had become so popular that in  even Queen Victoria visited the grave, giving the story royal approval. Interestingly, when she visited there were two stones, not three.ldquoWho started this story then  asked Finn, who wasnrsquot sure whether to be disappointed or amused at the audacity of it all.ldquoI suspect we will never know, his aunt replied. ldquoOne way to prove it either way would bethere was an excavation, anda skeleton of a short man with long arms was found, then Irsquod admit I was wrong.ldquoSo you admit you might be wrong then ldquoItrsquos always important to consider you may be wrong Finn, but when something is believed for long enough it can become a truth based on tradition and faith.

However, health experts are warning the pandemic is far from over there, with cases likely to pick upcurbs were lted too soon.Passengers will be asked to wear face masks on Ryanair flights potentially until , the airlinersquos boss has said, as he announced ato a more normal summer schedule.The budget airline plans to run around , flights every day during the summer this year, Michael OrsquoLeary said.ldquoI would imagine at this point in time, wersquore planning to continue to require mandatory face mask wearing on board our aircraft through the remainder of this summer schedule and next winterrsquos schedule, Mr OrsquoLeary said.According to the Scottish Governmentrsquos website, ldquoin all levels and settings, we should follow ldquoadvice and requirements such as on the use of face coverings.Speaking on March  when she outlined Scotlandrsquos route map out of the pandemic, the First Minister said that it is ldquohoped that we could reach ldquoat least Level  by the end of June.Currently, guidance under Level  includes the mandatory wearing of face coverings on public transport and shops ndash unless you are exempt.However, Ms Sturgeon said that ldquowe hope we will be able to get beyond even that, with a ldquoview to restoring as much normality as possible.Wersquove shared our timeline for a safe and gradual easing of restrictions in Scotland.All dates are dependent on scientic evidence that it is safe to ease further.Watch our video to find out more ##Read the timeline ## https:t.co XabMrdBXjt pic QoVbuyaXVShe told MSPs: ldquoIt is our fervent hope - and also our tentatively increasing expectation - that vaccination, continued and effective use of the test and protect system, and probably a continued compliance with precautions like good hand hygiene, will allow us to keep Covid under much greater control.ldquoAnd that this will allow us to enjoy many of the things that we took for granted before the pandemic ndash for example, normal family gatherings where we can hug our loved ones, sporting events, gigs and nightclubs.She said that she is ldquooptimistic this date will be over the summer, adding ldquohopefully something closer to actual normality, with the ability to hug those we love, will become possible.From this, we can establish that the wearing of face coverings is likely to be in place for some time yet.The First Minister has pointed towards ldquoactual normality by some point in the summer, suggesting thatthe science backs things up, there could be a potential relaxation of the rules around masks.However,we look towards the decisions being made in Australia, the levels of cases may need to get to extremely low levels for this to take place."},{"url":null,"title":"plea-owners-dogs-disturbing-birds-levenhall-links-nature-reserve","story":"Posters have been put up at Levenhall Links in support of the Responsible Dog Ownership Campaign, launched by the Scottish Government in partnership with the Scottish SPCA.The initiative seeks to remind dog owners that they have a legal responsibility to keep their dog under proper control in order to prevent and reduce the risk of incidents.The posterswere put up at the nature attraction ndash which once hosted RSPB Scotlandrsquos Big Nature Festival ndash by East Lothian Councilrsquos countryside rangers, who are also targeting other sites in the county.A council spokeswoman said that, as the weather improved, the days ened and people exercised outdoors, it was appropriate to remind dog walkers to keep dogs under control.She said: ldquoAt this time of year in countryside sites there may be young birds or nests that can be disturbed by dogs running off lead.ldquoThe posters are to remind dog owners to keep their pets close to hand and not to encourage behaviour that may cause problems to wildle or indeed other visitors.ldquoThis issue of countryside disturbance is not unique to Levenhall Links or East Lothian but is recognised throughout the UK as more people are accessing the countryside than ever before and are unaware of how their actions can have an adverse impact on wildle.ldquoIt has been estimated around . million pets had been bought in the UK during lockdown.

Image: Ian AndrewsThe council spokesperson said: ldquoUnfortunately, both people and dogs are walking off the paths and disturbing ious species of birds. One is the issue of ground nesting birds. We are entering the breeding season and last year was a very poor year for ground nesting birds, which is thought to be largely due to disturbance.ldquoSkylarks, meadow pipit and grey partridge are the key species in Musselburgh that suffer from disturbance.ldquoThe key message is lsquoareas of uncut coastal grassland may have nesting birds presentrsquo. Try to avoid these areas between April  and July , and stick to areas of cut grasslandyou wish to exercise your dog off-lead.The bird reserve at the lagoons is a wetland bird reserve, with wading birds roosting and feeding.ldquoOut-of-control dogs out of their ownerrsquos sight are having a negative impact, said the council spokesperson.One local birdwatcher recently tweeted about disturbance, which was retweeted by naturalist and television presenter Chris Packham and generated a lot of discussion.The council spokesperson said: ldquoIt seems  was a bad year for wildle throughout the whole of the UK due to more people out and about. The message is to think about where to walk your dog. Try to avoid estuaries where birds are feeding and remember that nature reserves and coastal grassland are sensitive areas.Jason Rose, chairman of community group Friends of Musselburgh Links, said: ldquoThis has been an issue on and off over the years but does seem to have got worse in recent weeks. Putting up fresh signs to make things clearer should help.ldquoItrsquos really importantyou bring dogs to the lagoons, whether you are the owner or a commercial walker, you stay away from the wader scrapes. There is fencing all the way round this area for a reason.ldquoThere is plenty of space where on the links to exercise dogs. Many owners are responsible, and we thank them.ldquoHowever, I also know that, on occasion, when a dog walker has been approached about disruptive behaviour, they have shown disinterest in the issue. These incidents clearly arenrsquot accidents and thatrsquos heartbreaking.ldquoThe lagoons are a Site of Special Scientic Interest and there were already prominent signs making this clear, asking people to stick to the paths and keep quiet. Dogs off the lead in this area will cause ground-nesting birds to scatter, leaving eggs and chicks vulnerable.

I suppose perseverance is the province of every wildle photographer.Finally, one sunny afternoon, Chris and I decided to go for a drive around the local fields.The road was quite narrow, and we had to pull over to let another car go past.As soon as we stopped, I opened the window and saw them ndash a good dozen hares chasing across the field.Usually, you see only one or a couple at most, so this sighting was exceptional.We parked up in haste and rushed towards the binkying hares. They were moving fast and chaotically, making it dficult to keep them in sight.One minute they were boxing and a second later they were all leaping high up. I could even see hair and saliva flying in the air ndash the field looked like it turned into a real boxing ring!As soon as the group flashed near us, I grabbed for my faithful camera and took several shots.There can be some confusion about whether or not the lsquoboxingrsquo hares are fighting, and whether this is an act between two malesor a male and female .This frantic behaviour usually occurs when a surge of testosterone pushes a buck to chase after his chosen doe across the fields in an attempt to mate.A doe can be chased by multiple bucks throughout the spring, which can understandably become a bit tiresome.This is when a female would turn around and fight a male off by initiating the boxing match. It is not unusual to see fur flying.It is believed that brown hares have lived in the UK since Roman times but are now considered naturalised.Their distinctive long, black-tipped ears and fast running make them easily distinguishable from rabbits.They are also much bigger and do not dig burrows.Hares live above ground in the open and dig lsquoformsrsquo: shallow depressions in the ground or grass.They can easily sink in the forms and blend in with the environment but, when disturbed, they take off and bound across the fields, often in a zigzag pattern.Brown hares can reach a speed of  miles per hour, which makes them Britainrsquos fastest land animal.Unlike many other British mammals, hares do not hibernate or store fat, so they need a constant food supply. They feed on a iety of grasses, herbs, twigs and bark to stay healthy.March and April are the best months to watch brown hares boxing, so I would like to encourage everyone to visit the local fields.Keep your eyes peeled for the hares and stay safe!www.facebook zanslens www.instagram zans_lens www zans_lens"},{"url":null,"title":"incredibly-disappointing-cancel-haddington-show-say-organisers","story":"The show, one of East Lothianrsquos most popular annual events, had been due to take place on June .However, for the second consecutive year, the committee of the United East Lothian Agricultural Societyhas made the dficult choice to not go ahead with the event.Alan Thomson, UELAS chairman, was disappointed to see the show again shelved due to coronavirus restrictions.However, he stressed that the safety of everyone involved was critical and it was not a decision taken lightly.In a statement, he said: ldquoCurrent Scottish Government guidelines suggest it would be almost impossible to run the event, which would usually attract a sea of competitors, trade stands, and visitors, from many dferent areas of Scotland and the north of England.ldquoThe safety of all our stakeholders is of paramount importance and, as such, we felt it was too great a risk to allow the show to take place this year.ldquoThe committee have already invested much time into the advance planning and organising of the event however, we all decided it would be in the best interests of the society to cancel now, rather than continue and risk costing the society money the longevity of UELAS is of utmost importance to us all.And he added: ldquoBeing forced to cancel our show for the second consecutive year is incredibly disappointing and we know how many people were looking forward to their annual visit to East Fortune.ldquoAlong with many others, we devote a great deal of time and have a huge emotional attachment to the show, so cancelling was certainly not a decision taken lightly.ldquoPlease take care of yourselves and your loved ones.

Why were governments doing dferent things  Which policies would work  We didnrsquot know. And to answer those questions, we needed comparable information on these new policies, including school closings, stay at home orders, contact tracing and more.A few weeks later, we launched theOxford COVID- Government Response Trackerto help find these answers. It has now become thelargest repositoryof global evidence relating to pandemic policies.To date, more than  data collectors from around the world have helped us track  dferent categories of coronavirus response, including lockdown, health, economic, and now vaccine policies in  countries.We then group those policies into a number of indices, including the stringency index, which records the number and intensity of closure and containment policies on a scale of zero to . Fteen countries reached  on the stringency index, while seven never surpassed . The countries with the highest average stringency were Honduras, Argentina, Libya, Eritrea and Venezuela. Those with the lowest were Nicaragua, Burundi, Belarus, Kiribati and Tanzania.A year on, what  have we learned about how governments have handled the largest health crisis in memory One surprising observation is that similarities can actually outweigh dferences. During the first months of the pandemic, governments mostly adopted similar policies, in mostly the same sequence, at mostly the same time ndash thetwo middle weeks of March .This policy convergence contrasts with the uneven spread of COVID- around the world. In March , though the disease was already prevalent in some parts of Asia, and rapidly spreading in parts of Europe and North America, it had yet to reach a wide scale of transmission in many parts of the world. The global lockdown rush therefore contrasted with the ying epidemiological situations countries faced. This meant that some countries locked down too late, and others arguably too soon.But as the pandemic progressed, countries ndash and, in some parts of the world,statesandregionsndash began to y considerably.Some governments were able to contain the first wave and then preserve those gains with a mix of targeted closure and containment measures, extensive testing and contact tracing, and firm international border controls.Places likeChina,Taiwan,VietnamandNew Zealandall managed not just to flatten the curve but to keep it flat, albeit with a few small flare-ups. In our data, we count  countries that have only experienced one wave of disease, though limited testing and reporting systems, or government suppression of information, make it hard to determine the true number.Other countries have had less success, seeing second, third, or even fourth waves of disease. Some of these have been relatively small outbreaks, controllable with test and trace measures and targeted restrictions. For example,South KoreaandFinland, though not able to eliminate the virus, have largely kept it from stressing health systems.Rollercoaster countries\" alt\"East Lothian Courier: Many countries have seen more than one wave of the virus. \" class\"editor-image\"Many countries have seen more than one wave of the virus. Too many countries have been on a veritable rollercoaster of rising and falling infections with corresponding policy whiplash and tragic death tolls. TheUnited States,United Kingdom,South Africa,Iran,BrazilandFrancehave seen successive waves of disease and have phased in and out of restrictive policies.Though initially debated, thescientic literatureis now clear: COVID- restrictions work to break the chain of infection, with timely, sharper restrictions having greater effect than slower, weaker ones.But while clearly true on average, there is no guarantee this recipe will always work. Countries likePerusuffered rising disease despite restrictive policies, perhaps showing that compliance and trust are also key to effectiveness. Some evidence also suggests thatstronger economic support makes COVID- restrictions more effective.Money isnrsquot everything\" alt\"East Lothian Courier: Money isnt everything when it comes to tacking a health crisis. \" class\"editor-image\"Money isnt everything when it comes to tacking a health crisis. While we can identy patterns of successful response, it is also evident that none of the country characteristics that wereexpected to provide an advantagebefore the pandemic, such as wealth or autocracy, have clearly done so.If you ide the world into countries with above average and below average deaths, robust government responses and weak ones, you will find in both groups plenty of rich countries and poor countries, democracies and dictatorships, those ruled by populists and those governed by technocrats.Success and failure are moving targets. As the pandemic has evolved, so have government responses. According to our data, vaccines are now available in  countries and rising. Notably, some of the countries most swtly rolling out vaccination ndash Israel, the UK, the United States, the UAE ndash are places that have previously struggled to control the virus through restrictions and test-and-trace systems.Lessons for the future\" alt\"East Lothian Courier: Boris Johnson reflects on one year since the first lockdown. \" class\"editor-image\"Boris Johnson reflects on one year since the first lockdown. One year on, the pandemic is by no means over, but already our data suggests someimplications and lessonsfor governments.First, old ideas about what contributes to pandemic preparedness need to be updated. Some countries with formidable scientic and healthcare capacitystumbled mightily. At the same time, places with less capacity, includingMongolia,ThailandandSenegalhave managed to largely keep people healthy and the economy running.Second, learning from others, or even from past experience, cannot be taken for granted. In March  eastern European countries like theCzech Republic, Hungary, and Bulgariasaw what happened to their western neighbours and imposed restrictions before community transmission became widespread. They largely avoided the death tolls many western European countries experienced in the first wave.But then just a few months later some of the same eastern European countries did the exact opposite, waiting too long to reimpose measures as cases rose in the autumn, with all too predictable consequences.Finally, while our work has tracked inidual governmentsrsquo responses, it is clear that exiting the pandemic will require global cooperation. Until transmission is curtailed throughout the world with restrictions and vaccinations, therisk of new iantssending us back to square one cannot be ignored.In the first year of the pandemic we saw little cooperation between governments. In the next, we will need to work together to control this disease."},{"url":null,"title":"section-north-berwick-high-street-closed-week-diversion-place","story":"The eastern end of High Street is closed atits junction with Quality Street from todayuntil Friday as SP Energy Networks is carrying out utility work in the area.The works are at the east side ofHigh Street and it is only that part thatis closed.A ersion is in place taking vehicles along Quality Street, Kirk Ports, Law Road, Clford Road, Marmion Road, Station Road, Station Hill and Beach Road.The HGV ersion also takes drivers along Church Road in addition to the roads above, with the non-HGV ersion taking drivers along Forth Street and Market Place instead."},{"url":null,"title":"new-manager-deep-end-musselburgh-sports-centre-reopens-next-month","story":"Sports centre in East Lothian are set to reopen to the public from Monday, April .And at Musselburgh, Martin Cameron, former assistant manager at Dunbar Leisure Pool, has succeeded Robert Ferguson, who has moved on after a career in the leisure industry spanning just shy of  years, firstly with East Lothian Council then with enjoyleisure, which runs sports centres on behalf of the council.Mr Ferguson has been in charge at Musselburgh Sports Centre for the past  years.Mr Cameron has spent the last  years within East Lothianrsquos leisure services.

Not least because it will be a standing reminder of the controversy surrounding her governmentrsquos handling of harassment complaints against Mr Salmond.Opposition MSPs on a Holyrood committee combined to declare that she had misled them. However, she was cleared by an official inquiry of breaching the Ministerial code and she comfortably won a confidence motion.:BRIAN TAYLOR:This is not a civil war in the SNP. This is more vicious and more visceralEarlier this week, SNP strategists were quietly hopeful that the worst of this issue was behind them. Ms Sturgeon must now hope that the momentum of an election campaign itself will subsume her former friendrsquos appeal.And so begins the first socially distanced election. The cynics among you may say that most people will find little trouble in staying far away from canvassing politicians. But, still, this contest really counts.Consider the cataclysmic changes since this Holyrood Parliament was elected in . Firstly, Brexit. The SNP will build upon that, but cautiously.They will recall that Scotland voted to remain in the EU and will argue that departure strengthens the case for independence. But, perhaps understandably, there will be few specics at this stage as to how and when Scotland would recreate links with Brussels.Secondly, the hideous plague. Self-evidently, the pandemic is the backdrop to the entire contest.Anecdotally, it would appear to be the received view that Nicola Sturgeon has worked tirelessly, although understandably Opposition parties will point to flaws.But what about broader strategy  The SNP will seek to build a post-pandemic economic and social consensus that ldquoScotlandrsquos recovery should be in Scotlandrsquos hands.That is couched to offend as few as possible. It most certainly includes the prospect of independence but does not explicitly rule out other devolved options, at least in the interim.In essence, it is a single transferable message: appealing to the underlying patriotic mood which created the SNP in the first place but also brought devolution into being.Of course, there is an added dimension. Most Nationalist speakers delivering their virtual stump speech will say ldquohellipin Scotlandrsquos hands, and not Boris Johnsonrsquos.They will seek to posit the Prime Minister as an external threat to Scotlandrsquos well-being, as antithetical to the Scottish perspective.Look at the four per cent pay offer to NHS staff in Scotland. SNP Ministers reckon that is genuinely merited and in keeping with the Scottish outlook. But it also helps that it is in contradistinction to the relative parsimony of the UK Government offer.It is also of course designed to quell Labour complaints, as is the move to take Scotrail into public ownership. Stand by for more universalism in the SNP manesto.The Conservative objective will be, as it was in , to corral supporters of the Union into voting Tory. They will depict their rivals as weak and vacillating, specically with regards to the prospect of a further independence referendum.Why then, you might ask, does Boris Johnson not pre-empt the issue by insisting that he will veto a referendum in any circumstances Because, of course, that would undermine the core of the Scottish Conservative campaign. They mean to depict the SNP as zealous fanatics, intent on independence, no matter what.\"@context\": \"https:schema.org\",\"@type\": \"VideoObject\",\"name\": \"Alex Salmond launches pro-independence Alba Party ahead of Scottish election\",\"description\": \"Alex Salmond launches pro-independence Alba Party ahead of Scottish election\",\"thumbnailUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer v media vRZxBmNB poster.jpg width\",\"uploadDate\": \"--T::+:\",\"duration\": \"PDTHMS\",\"contentUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer manests vRZxBmNB.mu\",\"embedUrl\": \"https:www.heraldscotland video  \",\"publisher\": \"@type\": \"Organization\",\"name\": \"HeraldScotland\",\"logo\": \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\"url\": \"https:www.heraldscotland sitelogo \",\"width\": ,\"height\": They plan to argue, further, that the only way to stop indyref is to prevent the SNP from gaining a majority at Holyrood. And they offer themselves as the ones to provide that obstacle, partly by depicting the SNP as ided, citing Alex Salmondrsquos latest initiative.More generally, an edict delivered by the PM would tend to reinforce the SNP message of external interference in Scotlandrsquos affairs. Douglas Ross knows that, especially in Holyrood elections, the voters want politicians to stand up for themselves and to stand up for Scotland.However, the Tories will say the best way to reinforce those Scottish interests is to use what they call the ldquobroad shoulders of the UK to rebuild the economy. Hence announcements such as the transition deal for North Sea oil.Labourrsquos new leader Anas Sarwar has three big challenges ahead. He too wants to thwart an overall SNP majority. But he wants to overhaul the Tories and regain second place.More generally, he wants to reverse a dismal Labour record. The party has slipped back in popular fortune at every Holyrood election since the very first in , when Donald Dewar entered coalition power.Mr Sarwar wants Labour to speak with a dferent tone. Less overtly aggressive and confrontational. More in keeping with the mid-pandemic anxieties of the voters over jobs, health care and education.He is very far from being a Sturgeon cheer-leader, not least because he is standing against her in her own constituency. But he thinks the Tories got it badly wrong when they called a motion of no confidence in her over the Salmond inquiry, before she had delivered her evidence.The Liberal Democrats will try triangulation, appealing to middle Scotland. They will depict the SNP as ldquoided and incompetent while inviting voters to shun the ldquoclumsy and cruel Tories.More broadly, they hint they are happy, once again, to talk to Labour, especially about widespread reform of the UK constitution. Labour strategists downplay any such link.The Greens, too, will stress the need for post-pandemic recovery, but will argue for a transformed economy, with a focus upon renewable energy and public transport. They say they are more committed to such aims than the SNP.:Brian Taylor: Herald columnist shares thoughts on indyrefParticularly seeking list votes, the Greens will target the SNP and others.

According to Professor Curtice, Mr Salmondrsquos sunny predictions of a pro-independence supermajority could turn to ashes on election day. Unless Albarsquos candidates secure a sufficient percentage of votes in the constituency lists their efforts may deprive the SNP of the handful of these they require to gain an overall majority.This of course, will rest on Mr Salmondrsquos personal popularity rather than on the attributes of Albarsquos other candidates. With every fresh vicissitude the former first minister of Scotlandrsquos sense of self-worth seems to swell. In similar circumstance most others would slink away, thankful simply to have survived the onslaught.Read more:Why on earth would Scotland want to be part of the EU anyway Of the other senior politicians only Anas Sarwar, new leader of the Labour Party in Scotland, responded with any measure of dignity. The rest, by degrees, exhibited many of the haughty and juvenile tendencies that have alienated so many rank-and-file voters. Nicola Sturgeon ndash now the primary target of her predecessorrsquos vengeance ndash couldnrsquot resist a pathetic dig at Mr Salmondrsquos perceived gambling habits. The partyrsquos Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, described Kenny MacAskill ndash the highest profile SNP defector to the new party ndash as ldquoan embarrassment.Mr Blackford, a nasty and vindictive politician, is still remembered across the political spectrum for the callous nature of his campaign against the tragic former Liberal Democrat leader, Charles Kennedy. Recently, he was forced to apologise for attempting to inflict mob justice on an innocent freelance photographer for breaching travel restrictions . At Westminster, Mr Blackford presided over meetings of his group which were barely-disguised, psychological ambushes to bring down his colleague, Joanna Cherry. One of these figures is indeed an embarrassment and itrsquos not Mr MacAskill.The nature of Mr Blackfordrsquos response encapsulates several of the reasons for Mr Salmondrsquos optimism. He and his senior colleagues have presided over the SNPrsquos transitioning from a party that exuded openness and bonhomie to one now characterised by authoritarianism and mind-control and built around the cult of their leader.Thus, the foot-soldiers of the wider Yes movement, those who turn up in all weathers to march under one banner for independence have lately felt a disdainful chill coming from those who gather around the SNP leadership. These people have felt betrayed and only too aware of how they are routinely portrayed by those using the Hate Crime Bill and gender theory to marginalise them. The suspicion persists among many of them that these ideological proclamations are convenient fig-leafs to cover the SNPrsquos failure to improve the le-chances of Scotlandrsquos poorest communities.Contempt for those who may be tempted to back Alba was apparent too in much of the media commentary. One writer dismissed all those thousands who have already pledged allegiance to the new party as ldquocranks, misfits and zoomers, these being the favoured slurs of middle-class commentators to dismiss anything they consider too rough to be worthy of actual engagement.Read more:Whats the SNPs problem with the working class Another idea thatrsquos taken root among the cafeacute politicos is that by playing more than one pro-independence team in the contest nationalists are ldquoGaming Democracy. Basically, this suggests that cornering the market in list seats as well as first-past-the-post ones is just not cricket, old boy, and undermines the spirit of the contest. Behave yourself.Democracy itself is the gaming of equality. Itrsquos how civilised, educated and opulent people mask the class-driven and unseen levers that still pull in their direction. You might think we exist in a state of one-person one-vote equality but the multi-billion-pound lobbying sector the adoption of neo-liberal power structures and the paths of least resistance always taken by politicians who promised to be radical indicate something . Boris Johnson dropped the pretence last week when he lauded the corporate \"greed\" thatrsquos apparently rescued us from the pandemic.The SNP leadershiprsquos fury at Mr Salmondrsquos re-emergence after hersquod been presumed permanently deleted should be viewed in the context of gravy trains being de-railed and comfortable lestyles jeopardised. His admitted inappropriate conduct in public office while being acquitted of any and all criminality will provide endless attack opportunities. These might carry more integritythey didnrsquot come from an organisation which has consistently ignored complaints from female members who have been threatened with sexual violence by known ndash and protected ndash party activists.Similarly, the accusations that Mr Salmond is threatening unity to satisfy his own ego-driven thirst for revenge. What unity  The parliamentary SNP has become a haven for preening, elitist performance artists while locking out working class people. It exists as a career opportunity for a cadre of mediocre middle-management types who gather to congratulate and affirm each other in issuing risk-free political emoluments. From time to time they pause, but only to abjure the thick proles for not being sophisticated enough to get on board with the progressiveness.We may all be entitled to take a certain view of Mr Salmondrsquos past conduct and his actual reasons for leading the Alba Party, but spare me the sanctimony and hypocrisy. Nicola Sturgeon, Ian Blackford and their parliamentary drones have fostered more ision in the SNP than anything that might be wrought by Mr Salmond. A generation of unbroken and unchallenged power has made them arrogant and self-indulgent. They have effectively established a party within a party and a platinum card membersrsquo lounge where access is granted only to a favoured few who are word-perfect in the leaderrsquos little red book of approved word and phrases.If Alex Salmond and Alba do damage the prospects of an overall Yes majority Nicola Sturgeon will only have herself to blame.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

The chat amongst us in these richer countries, like the UK, is all about getting our lives back, going to the pub and hugging our loved ones.But as Norway realised fairly early on, we wont be able to properly get on top of the pandemic until we learn to share. Despite having only around % of itrsquos own population vaccinated, the Norwegian government allowed COVAX, an initiative to vaccinate poorer countries, to redistribute , out of its . million vaccine doses to lower income countries.And COVAX hopes other richer countries will follow suit. Once the over-s have been vaccinated, should we not think about donating some of our doses to poorer countries  Personally,I had my first vaccine and delaying my second one for a few weeks could mean that an elderly woman in a Bangladeshi village could be vaccinated, I would absolutely wait. Worldwide, two and a half million people have died during the pandemic and, with a bit of global solidarity we could ensure these figures donrsquot increase exponentially in lower income countries in the next few months. Longer term, global economic instability as a result of the long tail of Covid will impact on all of us in some form.The British government is not quite ready to take that leap though. Having put millions into research and development of the vaccines, ordering  million doses of which around  million could be surplus, and offering funding to the COVAX initiative, it appears to be concentrating on vaccinating younger age groups in the UK before committing to donating any doses to lower and middle income countries.The problem, however, is that erting money to the COVAX scheme isnrsquot showing much of an impact at the moment because those same rich countries have pre-ordered most of the vaccines, leaving little available for the COVAX initiative to purchase.Some charities have therefore put pressure on the UK government to donate some of these doses to poorer countries through the COVAX initiative now: Vaccinate one of your own, and donate one to the global pot ndash sounds fair. UZMA:Rangers and Scottish football can be proud of response to Kamara incidentIn some of the less developed countries there is a growing sense of unease at the vaccine shortages, leading to some novel potential solutions. India and South Africa are asking for a waiver on medical patents which would mean that they could produce copies of the vaccines ndash for example the Pfizer vaccine ndash in their countries.This could potentially lead to a serious ramping up of the global supply, and, because their costs are lower, the vaccines would be cheaper to produce.Unsurprisingly, this has gone down like the proverbial lead balloon in richer countries, after fierce objections from the big pharmaceutical companies who, instead of seeing this as an opportunity to take a one-world approach to a once-in-a-century event, see it as the thin end of a profit-reducing wedge.In the US, President Biden is under pressure to push for a waiver. Those in favour of the waiver argue that the lost profits of the drug companies would be offset by economic gains around the world and crucially by lives saved.Interestingly it is the embattled Astra Zeneca which is one of two companies that has agreed that their vaccine can be produced under licence in India and South Korea to increase supply. If the waiver of the intellectual property rights proves too problematic for the pharmaceutical companies then this kind of licensing arrangement might be the way to go.This pandemic has forced us to consider dferent approaches: When it comes to human lives, leaving the distribution of vaccines to the market is morally wrong we all need to think more in terms of human solidarity and we must never forget how interdependent the global community is.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

The increase in popularity of pooches has certainly seen dog ownership rise markedly over the las year, so one of the areas in which the Scottish SPCA has become more active is in raiding and shutting down puppy farms. Welfare standards in these places are sometimes so low that dogs bought from dealers can die within days. In October  alone the charity investigated nearly  reports of puppy farming. However the Scottish SPCA also admitted  animals to its National Wildle Rescue Centre near Alloa, among them three Shetland ponies named Mouse, Maisie and Honey. They were handed to the charity in March  when their owners found themselves no longer able to care for them. They have since been rehomed.What is the charity saying Help us, basically. ldquoOur centres have hit capacity and we desperately need the support of the animal loving Scottish public so that they donrsquot let animals suffer, says the Scottish SPCArsquos Chief Superintendent Mike Flynn. ldquoIn many cases, neglect is not deliberate. Even people who love their animals can find themselves in a position where they are unable to continue to provide them with the care they need hellip This could be a change in personal circumstance or an accident.

You have demonstrated the kind of jaw-jutting, gritty stoicism that got Ranulph Fiennes through some of his more eye-popping feats of endurance.Irsquom sureyoursquod plonked the bold Ranulph in front of the semi-finals involving Matt Kuchar, Scottie Scheffler, Billy Horschel and Victor Perez, he probably wouldrsquove needed great fistfuls of Kendal Mintcake to sustain him.It was an exhausting Sunday. And that was a shame, because up until the whole thing petered out amid yawns, sighs and spluttering harrumphing, there had been some thrilling, captivating stuff to keep us all royally entertained over the first four days. Matchplay golf usually stirs the senses and grabs the attention.The drawn out, tiresome conclusion, however, made the salvage operation to dunt that massive ship out of the Suez Canal look like a hasty three-point birl in your car when you realise yoursquove left the iron on back at the house.Poor Ewen Murray, the voice of golf on Sky television, tried his best to keep affairs going but, at times, it must have been broadly equivalent to commentating on the  Yearsrsquo War such was the staggering passing of time.Pleased for Billy Horschel, but it must have been a hard watch for you. For that Irsquom sorry. Today might be a lesson for Scottie and Billy. Their best golf wonrsquot be played at that pace. No system, plan, no tempo or continuity. Theyrsquore better than that. @TheMasters  days away#:Catriona Matthews Major miss and hitsThe Scot was even moved to offer an apology on social media to those tuning in and, presumably, out after the final between Scheffler and Horschel. ldquoIt must have been a hard watch for you, said Murray, who was joined in the chorus of withering criticism by the likes of Colin Montgomerie and Catriona Matthew. ldquoFor that Irsquom sorry.There was a point when the deliberations, procrastinations and pre-shot dilly-dallyings led to so little happening, some frowning, grumbling viewers probably got up from theirs seat to give the TV a good old fashioned thump on its side in a vain effort to get things moving.Along with death, taxes and a landslide at the Rest and Be Thankful, another of lersquos great certainties is a debate about slow play. Indeed, one of the only things more boring than slow play itself is us lot banging on about slow play.We seem to be going round in very slow circles. For all the talk of the authorities taking a robust stance, nothing, particularly on the PGA Tour, gets done and players continue to take liberties with their timings.Itrsquos been a long-standing golfing pandemic and there doesnrsquot seem to be much urgency to dole out a vaccine.:Nick Rodger: Modern day matchplay misses the point of the formatOf course, when yoursquove only got a couple of matches in action, as was the case at the weekend, then the slow play issue is highlighted even more, purely because therersquos not much  you can focus on. Yes, it was windy, yes, it was a mentally and physically draining formatyou go all the way and yes, the stakes were high with world ranking points, Ryder Cup points and a vast first prize on offer.But, cor blimey, the amount of dithering did the game no favours at all and, not for the first time, we are all focussing in on the negatives. It prompted the kind of dodgy publicity even Boris Johnson would squirm at.The players involved on the final day must have knew the course like the back of their hands, having played three group games, a last- tie and a quarter-final to get there, but they still looked like they were approaching it for the first time with muttering, concerned analysis and constant reassurances required from their caddies.Throw in the dreaded green-reading books to add more layers of pondering on the putting surfaces and it was a bit like watching a diligent, chin-stroking John Bartholomew conducting a cartographic survey. By the end of a scrappy final, the trophy presented at the prize-giving ceremony just about had cobwebs on its plinth. ldquoI feel sorry for the fans watching the coverage because they didnt see any great golf shots or very few of them at that, said Horschel of a largely attritional trudge.Golf was never meant to be played at the tempo of a whirling dervish, eventhe swings of bountul club golfers resemble one. A few leisurely hours on the course is a blissful escape from the modern worldrsquos fevered clamour for instant gratication.The ious struggles, however, to capture a younger audience has been rooted, ultimately, in the perception that golf takes up too much of peoplersquos time.The trickle-down effect of doing what the pros do can be detrimental to the game. On a commercial level, meanwhile, hour upon hour spent watching golfers embroil themselves in prolonged, pre-shot routines that need to be carbon-dated may finally hit home with some television executive.As Sunday proved, the danger is that people simply switch off."},{"url":null,"title":"claire-taylor-farmers-workplace-not-amusement-park","story":"The Scottish Government will lt the lid on a cooped-up public and their new, untrained dogs, at a time where Scotlandrsquos countryside is most vulnerable ndash slap bang in the middle of lambing and calving. You wonrsquot know just how fearful farmers are about this until you see the results of a devastating dog attack on livestock hellip it can be horric.With sunshine forecast across the country from Friday, the masses are gearing up for a great big green escape to the countryside. But therersquos a major change this spring and that has been the explosion of new dogs over the last year which are about to be unleashed for the first time.Glancing down at my familyrsquos rough-coated Jack Russell terrier gnawing loudly on a Nylabone chew at my feet, I realise what a salvation our furry canine friends have been during this dficult time but am equally struck by the enormity of responsibility which comes with owning a dog and the training involved.My hat goes off to new dog owners who have invested in online training classes over the last year, but in the coming weeks, for many, it will be the first time their dogs will be let off the lead in an open space ndash putting their recall training into practice. That open space is likely to be on farmland, and our fields are quickly filling up with new-born lambs as farmers and crofters embark on one of their busiest seasons of the year.  Right to roam is a wonderful thing, but with unfettered access to the countryside, comes the duty of responsible access. So, in short, keep your dog on a lead around livestock and be wary of ground nesting birds and other wildle.This might seem mind-numbingly obvious to most reading this column, but the fact is, there are more than . million households in the UK who have brought a new pet into their families since the start of this pandemic. This includes a lot of new dog owners who may not be aware of the devastating consequences their cute fluffy pet could have on new-born lambs.I will never stop reminding people about the fact that any dog has the capacity to chase, maim and kill livestock, as every day I am confronted with painful stories and devastating images of farmers who have suffered the horric consequences of an out-of-control dog savaging their sheep.This past week, South of Scotland MSP Emma Harper received unanimous support for a Bill which sought to toughen the penalties on offer to the courts when convicting irresponsible dog owners involved in livestock attacks. Now, guilty iniduals could serve up to  months in jail and or a fine of up to pound,. For years, farming organisations and the police have been running educational campaigns warning dog owners of the consequences loose dogs can have on livestock, but now this new Bill will add further weight and deterrence.Since I started my job with the Scottish Farmer in , I have supported Emma Harper with her proposals and have followed her journey as she met up with farmers across the country, listening to their concerns and promising to bring them justice, so I felt a huge rush of emotion on Wednesday night when this Bill was debated for the third and final time in Holyrood and will now proceed for royal assent before passing into law in six monthsrsquo time.This is a huge moment for Scottish farming and offers much hope for the future that these incidents are being recognised and will be dealt with more fairly. The whole industry is indebted to Emma Harper and her team who have campaigned unreservedly on this over the past four years and these tough new penalties will hopefully send a strong reminder to dog owners of what is at stake,their dog chases or kills livestock. Keeping your dog on a lead around livestock isnrsquot the only thing that should be a no-brainer, but so should picking up your dog poo. This isnrsquot just a responsibility reserved for walking on our beaches or our streets, but also in our fields.Neosporosis is one of the hidden diseases which can be carried in dog faeces and poses a serious risk to livestock and other dogs. More dogs are being infected by the parasite neospora as a result of the growing trend for feeding dogs raw meat. The parasite sheds eggs passing out in dogsrsquo poo andleft behind in a field, can remain infectious for up to six months. If consumed by cattle, in contaminated water, grass or in hay this disease can cause abortions and is responsible for more than  per cent of abortions in cattle.I spoke to a local farmer from Ayrshire this weekend who told me that  acres of one of his silage fields was so saturated by dog poo that he was unable to use it to feed his cattle this winter. He had to accept that  bales ndash equating to around pound, ndash had to be discarded. He told me that despite there being a woodland running alongside the field with a route for dog walkers, that the public preferred to walk through his field and were oblivious to what their dogs leave behind. He is rightfully worried, that from this Friday, the hordes are about to descend, and his field will be ruined once again, and his livestock put at risk.We all should exercise our right to enjoy our beautul countryside, but be mindful of whose workplace you are passing through, and afford it the same respect you would ask for in ."},{"url":null,"title":"alex-salmond-albas-cynical-attempt-score-womens-votes-galling","story":"To refresh memories: Mr Salmond has admitted to inappropriate behaviour towards women. When askedhe was still a \"bully and a creep\" by my colleague Tom Gordon, the former first minister trotted out a well rehearsed line that he would rely on the findings of \"two court cases, two judges, one jury and three inquiries\".This is a line were bound to hear repeated and repeated again over the next six weeks as Mr Salmond faces persistent questions about his previous conduct. Clearly he is sticking fast to the notion that because he was cleared of all criminality, morality means nothing.So to the ramshackle launch of his new Alba party and first candidate Eva Comrie, a solicitor from Alva, declaring her priorities.\"As a woman and a lawyer,\" she announced, \"You might understand I have been a little disappointed that equalities policies have not been as positive as they might have been,\" explicitly declaring that womens rights are first on her agenda.Then Inverclyde local councillor Chris McEleny was announced. Mr McEleny has been outspoken about his views on the conflict between womens rights and trans rights, and reform of the Gender Recognition Act.Were only about five minutes into the launch event by this point and politics watchers on Twitter are starting to speculate that Albas bid for the list seats will have put the frighteners on the Green Party.Only those who havent been paying close attention could have thought so. The debate over trans and womens rights has been among the main rts in the SNP.The Green Party has been absolute in its support of trans rights and of GRA reform, losing MSP Andy Wightman as a consequence. A party unsupportive of this position is highly unlikely to attract Green voters.A few hours later on Newsnight Mr Salmond explicitly referenced a need to protect single sex spaces. It would be marvellous to hear Mr Salmond detail exactly why women need single sex spaces, as enshrined in law. Only inflated ego or delusion would protect him from a niggling feeling of hypocrisy while doing so.Yesterday morning Shettleston councillor Michelle Ferns defected from the SNP to Alba, positioned by the new party as a \"key figure\" in Glasgows landmark equal pay settlement.Very swtly, GMB Scotland organiser Rhea Wolfson, who truly did earn her keep during the dispute, countered Albas claims. \"Ferns was not involved in the slightest,\" she tweeted, \"Not in settlement negotiations, not in the chamber, not industrially, not in meetings with the Administration.\"This from Alba is a particularly insulting claim given how badly and consistently women were let down by politicians on this issue, and how fiercely they had to organise and fend for themselves.Then, on April , Alba will host a women-only conference, pledging to put women ldquofront and centre of key decisions.The utter cynicism of a man who, by his own admission, is \"no angel\" with women, attempting to use them as a shield is jaw dropping.He is trying to rehabilitate himself into political le by using womens rights as a campaign issue. If you believe the theory that Mr Salmond is trying to re-enter political le in order to take down his female rival, then the ploy becomes all the more obscene.As well as the gobsmacking gall of it, there is also a risk of further damage. The trans and womens rights debate goes in circles without any hint of progress or resolution.It is almost impossible to have any sort of sensible, productive conversation about the issue, with practical solutions and compromises almost entirely lacking.Mr Salmond might be trying to provide a political home for gender critical feminist voters, but let no one think this will advance a solution for the cause. Instead, the trans rights side will use an alliance with the politician to discredit those with opposing views while gender critical feminist energy will be wasted defending having a man like Salmond on board.Meanwhile, those who sit gently in the middle of many of the topics raised by the creation of Alba - whether they are soft yes or unsure where they stand on feminist or trans issues - will be further alienated as they look on aghast at yet more unproductive rammies.There are women who have been left politically homeless by some decisions of the SNP who may be persuaded, despite Mr Salmonds audacity.

It thinks Ms Sturgeon has failed to recognise that SNP policy is redundant post-Brexit. Since Britain left the EU, the SNP has tried to pretend that nothing has changed, that the borderless  prospectus still applies. Yet everything has, and Alba is right to call out this pretence.There will obviously be a hard border with Englandand when Scotland leaves the UK and joins the European Union. More precisely, there will be a trade and regulatory ide, since the pre-existing UK Common Travel Area will mean passports and visas are unnecessary after independence. Alba sees this as an issue that has to be addressed. Though in opening this Pandoras Box, Mr Salmond could end up with more than he bargained for.A lot of SNP supporters, and Alba fellow travellers, are distinctly unenthusiastic about rejoining the European Union, and not just because of Ursula von der Leyens threats to start a vaccines trade war. There has long been a eurosceptic strand in the SNP. Many on the left favour the Norway option of joining the single market but not the political institutions of Brussels. The SNP has tried to keep a lid on this debate too, but not for much longer.Read more: Scots may loathe him, but Boris doesnrsquot give a damn about Plan BMr Salmond has also called Nicola Sturgeons bluff about a Scottish independence referendum being imminent, delivered by a new Section  order from Westminster. That is simply not going to happen. It is fancul to believe that Boris Johnson is going to risk breaking up the UK just because the SNP wins a majority in Holyrood. He will simply keep saying that now is not the time for indyref, as Britain emerges from Brexit. Sir Keir Starmer will back him to the hilt. Mind you, there is equally no guarantee that Mr Johnson would recognise an SNP-Alba supermajority. He might just echo Ms Sturgeon saying it is ldquocheating.However, this argument that having a pro-independence party standing for list seats alone is somehow undemocratic, or ldquogaming the system as Ms Sturgeon puts it, is simply wrong. The Scottish Green Party is a pro-independence party which is also standing only in list seats. As the Times reported earlier this month, the SNP leadership has been in discussions with Patrick Harvie about a formal Green-SNP coalition and even used the term ldquosupermajority to refer to their combined electoral strength.From the point of view of an ordinary SNP supporter, voting Alba for list seats is a no-lose proposition. Older working-class voters will likely see Alba as preferable to the ldquowoke Greens, whose policy on transgender issues is so controversial that their star MSP, Andy Wightman, had to leave the party because he wasnt permitted to speak about it. At any rate, SNP voters will have to be given better reasons not to vote Alba than that Mr Salmond is a bad man and that standing on the list is cheating. Ms Sturgeon may have forgotten, but only a few years ago the Scottish National Party renamed itself ldquoAlex Salmond for First Minister on list ballot papers.This man is a huge part of SNP folk memory. The attempt to write him out of history, like a nationalist Trotsky, was never going to succeed. Rather than attacking him personally Mr Sturgeon would be better advised to stay silent. Let the electoral system do its work and see what the voters deliver. After all, she is still vastly more popular among Scottish voters than Mr Salmond.

Dave Thompson, a couple of years ago, did the arithmetic and suggested a separate but linked list independence party. Some of us saw the sense and expected her to bring him in for discussion, and agree to it with some degree of SNP control, such as a common  and commitment to support the SNP for government.Had she not dismissed his idea, ldquosupermajority would be her slogan now, because an SNP-supported but separate list party would have left little electoral space for Alba to elbow into.Ms Sturgeonrsquos error of rejection arose in my view from the  belief, nurtured by the cult of personality, that she is the one and only who matters in, and to, the independence movement. As she is finding out, that it is not so.Jim Sillars, Edinburgh.SUPERMAJORITY IS A NON-STARTERALBA MP Neale Hanvey believes that in the coming election a majority of nationalist MSPs would be representative of the electoral system, not the electorate. He is right. In the  election, the SNP secured . per cent of the constituency votes and .% of the list votes on a turnout of %. Its share of the electorate was therefore only .%. Hardly a resounding mandate for independence.The same thing will happen in the  election, so the idea of a \"supermajority for independence\" is a non-starter.William Loneskie, Lauder.* IF Alex Salmond were to achieve a supermajority in the Scottish Parliament which roundly defied the balance of the wishes of the Scottish electorate, it might not ignite civil commotion but it would be a text book formula for that outcome. Perhaps Mr Salmond, from his dalliance with Russian culture, feels ready for the task of unrepresentative governance.Michael Sheridan, Glasgow.NO VISION FOR OUR FUTUREANDREW Dunlopjoins a growing list of unionist commentators fervently hoping that Alex Salmondrsquos Alba Party will derail progress towards an independent Scotland.Nowhere in the article was there a vision of Scotlandrsquos future or what radical initiatives his Conservative Party might offer Scottish voters to address problems such as inequality and child poverty. The familiar themes of stoking fear of borders and currency predominate, insinuating that the Union is forever and that now will never be the time.Baron Dunlop of Helensburgh asserts that the Alex Salmond affair has shown deficiencies in Scotlandrsquos governance. I actually agree with him on this point after Mayrsquos election an urgent reassessment of the role of the Lord Advocate and the Crown Office is required. However, when considering how Scotland is governed, I would gently remind the noble Baron that he is an active member of the largest undemocratic assembly outside of China. As a member of the House of Lords he has never been elected to the Holyrood or Westminster parliaments yet he held executive office as Under Secretary of State for Scotland for two years under David Cameron and Theresa May. I doubtBaron Dunlop sees the hypocrisy of his position on this point or the irony of his accusation that Alex Salmond is ldquogaming the election while his colleague, Douglas Ross, was attempting, and failing, to facilitate a unionist electoral pact.I fear Andrew Dunloprsquos aspirations for the Alba Party to tarnish the First Minister and take seats from the SNP are misplaced. If anything, Mr Salmonds intervention is a greater threat to unionist list seats, particularly in the six regions where the SNP have no list seats due to their large constituency vote. The days of Scotland being governed by the ennobled and the entitled are coming to an end and the activities of unelected politicians such as Andrew Dunlop are one of the main drivers of the desire to put our future in the hands of the Scottish people.Iain Gunn, Elgin.MAKE SALMOND THINK AGAINTHE US has Donald Trump , England has Boris Johnsonand now Scotland has Alex Salmond .By their own admission, all \"Men Behaving Badly\". God help us.As a long-time independence supporter, I was pleasantly surprised when Alex Salmond stepped down after the referendum in . He had had a remarkable career and had been the outstanding politician of his era despite having some fairly obvious flaws, but there were signs that he was already losing the plot and Nicola Sturgeon appeared to be the ideal successor. Apart from a lack of flexibility in the independence campaign, tying himself rigidly to the pound sterling and offering no alternative to EU membership, Mr Salmond had already lost a lot of my respect when sooking up to Rupert Murdoch, Mr Trump and royalty.However, my heart sank when he came back to the forefront as an MP, as it was clear that his ego wouldnt allow him to remain in the shadows for long. I suspect that the unholy mess the SNP has got itself into is closely connected to his continuing to interfere from the sidelines both then and after losing his seat at Westminster. Not for Mr Salmond fading out of the limelight with a cushy number somewhere while writing his memoirs and playing golf.By his own admission, his conduct has been less than honourable and I hope that his tarnished reputation will dissuade the vast majority of independence voters from supporting his new party. Sadly, history as exemplied by Messrs Trump and Johnson shows us that this is not always case. I can only hope that the Scottish electorate is more discerning and sends Mr Salmond home to think again with his tail between his legs.Gordon Evans, Glasgow.NEW PARTY IS NOT INCLUSIVECOMING from France where the National Rally gets  per cent of the vote, I have always been surprised that there was no populist far-right nationalist party in Scotland. This has probably changed with the creation of the Alba Party.The National Rally in France defines itself as economically left-wing. It believes it protects the working class, and takes pride in being socially conservative. It claims to defend the \"average Frenchman\" and \"common sense\", against the \"betrayal of inevitably corrupt elites\". This ideology is replicated across the European far right, from Lega Nord to Vox.Alba does not have any policies or a manesto, but it is clear to see where it has positioned itself already.The presence of ex- Group members, like Kenny MacAskill and Alex Salmond, shows that its leaders want to present themselves as an old-fashioned socialist party on economic matters, class reductionist and radical.Their stance on social issues is transparent too. Alba rapidly defined itself as socially conservative: Mr Salmond repeatedly used anti-LGBT terminology in his commentary about womenrsquos rights and defines his nationalism as the kind that trumps any progress on social issues. \"Get indy done\" clamoured some of his supporters a few weeks ago.Despite Mr Salmondrsquos calls for unity, Alba is miles away from the inclusive nationalism the SNP or the Greens stand for. The SNP and the Greens should stay well away from Alba.Jeacutereacutemie Fernandes, Elgin.LET US AVOID THE RANCOURWHATEVER  Alex Salmond has done, by creating a new political party he has opened up the possibility of igniting the independence argument beyond the increasingly intemperate SNP-led debate and, by so doing, giving the electorate the chance to think of independence beyond the narrow SNP-dominated focus. In this context, Scotlands printed media should also be mindful both of its language and tone and allow for all views to be fairly and accurately represented. Let us avoid the bitter rancour of .Steven J Main , Bathgate.FM DOESNT DO IRONYIT was another cornflakes-choking moment this morning when I read that the First Minister had pilloried those who \"put self-interest ahead of the countryrsquos best interestsrsquorsquo .Those of us who witnessed the very recent Holyrood inquiry and therein Ms Sturgeonrsquos recounting of several seemingly-selective attacks of amnesia will shake our heads at that remark.

Aside from Grooves, he has established several hospitality ventures over the years, including Kirkwall nightclub Fusion, Harbour Street bar Helgi’s, and Albert Street’s Twenty One.Having moved location no less than six times since it began in , Grooves most recently found a home in the redeveloped Old Library on Laing Street.

Grooves Toys will be based at the former Woollen Mill building, while Grooves records will move to what is currently Little Island. Meanwhile, Archive Coffee and the Sound Archive will remain at Laing Street, leaving the rest of the Old Library building ripe for redevelopment.If this wasn’t a big enough sht already, Mr Stevenson is set to finally take the big leap west, setting up shop in the former Commercial Hotel premises in Stromness, selling toys.All the while, the Orcadian entrepreneur will be getting plans under way for another signicant redevelopment, this time on Kirkwall’s Bridge Street.The former R.

Just today we have heard from Nova Innovation that they are now powering electric cars in Shetland directly from tidal energy, a clear sign of the potential for direct benefits in the immediate future.“These things are all happening and the industry is on the up, but without the final leg up from government – whether in Contracts for Dference or other fiscal support – then someone  will step in.#This is a chance for high-value jobs to be created across the UK and particularly in island communities, rather than importing technology that we could be leading on here.“The need for commercialisation support will only go away when that need is fulfilled, whether it is by the UK or others. With COP [the  United Nations Climate Change Conference] rapidly approaching, it is an opportunity for us to make a statement on a major green technology for the future – it is time to commit.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It is a depressingly all-too familiar sight.“Stagnation” was the term Mr MacKinnon used, and he was spot on.As lives become ever more disconnected from the land, it’s quite understandable why people no longer have the inclination, or time, particularly when there is no great financial . But how it must frustrate those desperate to work the land to see all these crofts going to waste.Survey after survey has demonstrated a huge interest from people wanting to get a foot on the ladder, but they can’t because the traditional avenue of family inheritance is not open to them.The croft tenancies that do come on the market go for astronomical sums, way beyond the reach of young families and completely out of kilter with agricultural potential.And this is the problem, the reason that so many people hold onto non-working crofts is because they can see the pound signs they can see what it might fetch in terms of its housing potential, with estate agents only too happy to downplay the fact that every croft tenancy sale and every de-crofting application has to be approved by the Crofting Commission. It’s not proved too much of an impediment in the past.In fairness to the commission, they have made improvements. As much as the law enables, they do now try and prevent housing speculation – although one recent case in Lochalsh suggests there may be still some way to go. And they have at least made the right noises about dealing with neglect, which has prompted an increase in formal sub-leases and tenancy transfers.But as Mr MacKinnon noted, it is dficult for them to really stamp their authority without the proper resources.So an impasse remains, young families are unable to get access to land while countless crofts go to waste.But there is a solution, evenit will make for an uncomfortable journey: remove the ability to trade tenancies on the open market and at the same time get rid of the right to buy a croft. At a stroke, those motivated purely for monetarywill disappear their incentive gone. Then arm the commission with the necessary resources to properly tackle neglect —rather than the current practice of gentle encouragement without force — and those who have crofts but can’t do the work will have to quickly find a solution. Step forward new entrants.Granted, the opposition to such an approach will likely be signicant. Denying people the opportunity to do with an asset what they please will be seen as anti-libertarian, a curb on personal freedom, and you can easily predict the outrage.But the responsibility of a crofter is not to do as you please. You are part of a unique system of land tenure which was established nearly  years ago to keep people and communities alive. That is still very much of relevance today. Denying those fortunate enough to have crofts from lining their own pockets and ensuring everyone lives up to their duties doesn’t seem an unreasonable expectation in that context.It is expected that, Covid recovery depending, the new term of the Scottish Parliament willto the matter of crofting reformand there is an opportunity here for a proper radical approach which addresses the needs of crofting today but, crucially, with the principles of old at its heart.It will require politicians and leaders of strength and conviction who are able to make a compelling case in the face of undoubted opposition, who can the see the vision that a new, radical approach will bring and who can reject pressure from all sorts of vested interests. The trouble is: there is precious little evidence of that calibre of inidual in Scotland’s political landscape of today.IT SEEMS like only yesterday I was talking about preparing for the winter and here we are with spring on the horizon.

Fasciola hepaticais a tiny mud snail which is ingested through grazing and attacks the liver. It thrives in wet conditions and is re in Scotland.There are routine treatments, but it’s now recognised that the parasite is developing a resistance to some of the products on the market. As a result of that, the advice is to constantly use dferent ones and I probably wasn’t as meticulous in this as I should have been, although I know that others too have had increased problems with fluke in the early part of the winter – and it was horrendously wet in November through to December.So the dry, hard frost of a couple of weeks ago was a godsend and it was on such a bracing but beautul morning that we gathered for the scanning, the ground underfoot like uneven concrete. You could have gotten away with your trainers.Once the work was completeI linked up my iPhone with the scanner and a detailed breakdown of the results popped up on the screen. A couple of pings later and it was out in the ether, all the way out to the North Sea where it was downloaded by someone not able to be in attendance to view his own results almost instantaneously.It was a lovely symbiosis of tradition and technology, though goodness knows what the bodachs of yesteryear would have made of it all."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/John_Purser-202030713-edited.jpg","title":"tobar and dualchais pure escapism among the fenian","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThat may explain why story-telling and mythology were so highly prized.

Her style of writing may seem slightly arch to some today, but none other than Padraic Colum was happy to write the foreword to her book, full of praise for her writing skills.She was a kind of predecessor of Margaret Fay Shaw, that most redoubtable of ladies, made of Pittsburgh steel, chain-smoking and with a bourbon to hand and her beloved piano just across the room.

In the past  months many thousands of people across the U.K. have died of Coronavirus. Tuesday rd March marked the first anniversary of the U.K. lockdown. A National Day of Reflection co-ordinated by Marie Curie was organised and this brought the U.K. together to stop, reflect and remember those who lost their lives to Coronavirus. Volunteers from Broughshane and District Community Association decided to organise their own tribute. Chairman Lexie Scott told the The Ballymena : “Valued members of Broughshanes local community, our voluntary groups, cultural organisations and places of worship came together and laid flowers at our ‘National Day of Reflection’ site at Broughshane’s old police station in remembrance of everyone who had died during the past year”. Mr. Scott continued, “We were overwhelmed by the support we received from so many families and community organisations who came to pay tribute and offer their support by laying dozens of freshly cut bouquets of flowers. So many of us were unable to attend funerals in the past  months, Tuesday gave those a chance to stop, reflect and pay their respects to all those we couldn’t mourn”. Broughshane and District Community Association spokesperson, Sandy Wilson went onto say, “There are still tough times ahead but with the successful rollout of the vaccine across Northern Ireland we in Broughshane, ‘The Garden Village of Ulster’ and across the Braid Valley look forward to much brighter days ahead”.

Ten-year-old Ben, and his dad Andrew, were on Sky Sports News last Monday to talk about his  miles challenge - unaware that Rashford was waiting in the wings.After askingthe striker would run one of the miles with him, presenter Paul Gilmour asked Ben what would he doRashford was about to sit down in front of them The striker appeared on the Zoom screen and a stunned Ben and Andrew were completely speechless!Rashford told Ben he was “very, very proud of him.”“You should be very, very proud of yourself and Im sure your family are proud of you,” said the Man U star.“Its bringing me great joy to see you do the things youre doing. Im rooting for you and I hope you do well.”Meanwhile, Ben’s March Marathon for NI Children’s Hospice, was his own idea. The Primary  lad was inspired to do the challenge by Rashford, who was awarded an MBE last year after urging the Government to allow around .m children in England to claim free school meal vouchers in the summer holidays during the Covid- pandemic.The TW Braga  team captain is running a mile a day for  days in March and has so far raised pound, after setting a pound target.Reflecting on the meeting with Rashford dad Andrew said it had still not quite sunk in.“I still cannot believe that it happened,” outlined Andrew.“Ben is level headed and has not let it go to his head.”Andrew said Ben is thrilled to have met Rashford - but his main priority is hoping that the public give generously to the NI Children’s Hospice.At the end of the Sky Sports interview Ben asked Rashford for a signed shirt!Dad Andrew said Ben is looking forward to it taking pride of place on his bedroom wall. “The very fact hes getting a shirt will kind of be a reward for him after all the hard work he is putting in at the minute to raise the funds,” said Andrew.“Im quite proud that hes going to have something to remind him of that in the years to come.”Following the Sky Sports interview, Rashford shared the moment on Twitter and wrote: “My guy Ben, what a hero.”In Ben’s fund raising appeal for NI Children’s Hospice he explained that with no sports taking place due to lockdown he wanted to build up his fitness by doing some running - and set himself the target of running  miles during March. “Being inspired by how Marcus Rashford had helped people in lockdown I want to raise some money for other kids in Northern Ireland who are sick,” outlined Ben.“Please help me reach my target by donating to the Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice by visiting www.justgiving fundraising benjiballer. I will keep you updated with my progress on my instagram page - Benjiballers.”Ben’s Primary School teacher, Johnny Fisher, said the school is right behind the fund raising venture.And in a Zoom class last Wednesday Mr. Fisher chatted with Ben about his once-in-a-letime experience with the Manchester United star.Mr. Fisher alerted the staff and parents about Ben’s March Marathon and donations were forthcoming. “As a school we are very proud of Ben and wish his fund raising, for a very worthy cause, every success,” said the teacher.Ben is also receiving support from his hometown club Larne FC, with midfielder John Herron joining him on some of his runs, while the entire squad will run with him on his final day this Friday March .

All children who speak English and an additional language - whether that language is Polish, Lithuanian, Chinese, Arabic, Irish, Ulster Scots, or any other language - will grow up with the ability to move between languages and cultures. In addition to cognitive benefits, this will give them an advantage in the job market, whether they opt to work locally or globally.The Department of Education collects language information as part of the school census, which parents complete when their child enrols. The department uses the term #newcomer# to refer to a pupil who does not have satisfactory language skills to participate fully in the school curriculum and does not have a language in common with the teacher.However, the language question is not just applicable to children whose parents have recently moved to Northern Ireland, a Department of Education spokesperson explained.Newcomer and Home language are two dferent things. A pupil may have a home language other than English but not be a Newcomer.This designation does not refer to indigenous pupils who choose to attend an Irish-medium school or Unit. That circumstance is dealt with under the Irish medium education policy.Among other first languages of NI pupils,  speak Urdu,  are fluent in Japanese and  converse naturally in Romany.Of the more common western European languages, Spanish is most popular with  speakers,  speak Italian and  German.Belfast Most ReadBobby Storey funeral: PSNI chief Byrne rules out resigning Video: Stunning Co Down home that’s not run of The MillNotorious Northern Ireland paedophile convicted of rape after being transferred from jail in EnglandLiam Neeson’s joy as Catholic school converts to integrated statusCoronavirus Northern Ireland: five further deaths and  new casesTop VideosPlayArlene Foster calls for PSNI chief to quit over handling of Bobby Storey funeralPlayFootage shows antisocial behaviour in Belfast#s Holyland PlayCall for ‘accountability’ for Sinn Fein leadership over Storey funeralLatest EducationRoad safety book proves popular with Northern Ireland schoolsLiam Neeson’s joy as Catholic school converts to integrated statusParents left #stressed and tired# by home schooling with % reporting negative impact on mental health ViewpointOpinionFamilies have been put under pressureCovid threw our plans for children into disarray, says North Down mumLatest from Belfast Carl Frampton#s #ego# lesson against Josh Warrington will help inspire success against Jamel Herring, says Jamie MooreVideo: The complete guide on how to cut your hair at home in lockdownLarne Port worker and family relocated after loyalist threatDaniel James backs Robert Page to lead Wales at Euro neededBobby Storey funeral: #Ambiguity# of Covid regulations to blame for prosecutions decision, says Byrne ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Merchant Square is an indication of what Belfast can achieve.”Noel Lander, director at JLL, said: “The landmark sale of Merchant Square demonstrates the investor appetite for best in class regional offices with secure income streams and strong environmental, social and corporate governancecredentials.”Oakland was advised by JLL, AL Goodbody and KPMG. The purchaser was advised by SPS Investment, King  Spalding International LLP, TLT LLP and BDO LLP.Speaking to the Belfastearlier this year, Kevin MacAllister, PwC Northern Ireland regional market lead, said its move into the new offices — expected later this year — coincided with a new era in work. “Undoubtedly the world of working and how we deliver professional services will change, but it’s not either or, office or home working. We’ll be into a much more blended, flexible working regime.“We’ve been developing it quite closely with our people, and quite a signicant part of the floor space will be a wellbeing area. We’ll be providing things like onsite healthcare with GP services, yoga classes — anything that has a wellbeing angle to it.”He added: “We’re trying to bridge the gap between home and office and sort of blur the lines a little bit, so you make an office an extension of home.”The NI Civil Service has said it’s consulting with trade unions on a future remote working policy for its staff of ,.Belfast Most ReadBobby Storey funeral: PSNI chief Byrne rules out resigning Video: Stunning Co Down home that’s not run of The MillNotorious Northern Ireland paedophile convicted of rape after being transferred from jail in EnglandLiam Neeson’s joy as Catholic school converts to integrated statusCoronavirus Northern Ireland: five further deaths and  new casesTop VideosPlayArlene Foster calls for PSNI chief to quit over handling of Bobby Storey funeralPlayFootage shows antisocial behaviour in Belfast#s Holyland PlayCall for ‘accountability’ for Sinn Fein leadership over Storey funeralLatest Northern IrelandLarne Port worker and family relocated after loyalist threatBobby Storey funeral: #Ambiguity# of Covid regulations to blame for prosecutions decision, says Byrne Man in his s dies in M crash Bobby Storey funeral: Chief Constable Byrne has #lost confidence# of unionists, says FosterMan killed in three-car crashLatest from Belfast Video: The complete guide on how to cut your hair at home in lockdownLarne Port worker and family relocated after loyalist threatBobby Storey funeral: #Ambiguity# of Covid regulations to blame for prosecutions decision, says Byrne Man in his s dies in M crash Man held over attack on Asian American woman in New York street,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

He added: DS Properties are acquisitive, and they#ve done great things with Crescent Link. They see this park as a key asset to their portfolio.Speaking at the time of the acquisition, Holywood Exchange#s new owner said it was very confident about the economic prospects for Belfast and Northern Ireland as a whole and says the latest purchase very much builds on this confidence in the Northern Ireland economy.The impact of the pandemic has affected all businesses and the retail sector has been no exception to this, spokesman Matthew Beddow said.Belfast Most ReadBobby Storey funeral: PSNI chief Byrne rules out resigning Video: Stunning Co Down home that’s not run of The MillNotorious Northern Ireland paedophile convicted of rape after being transferred from jail in EnglandLiam Neeson’s joy as Catholic school converts to integrated statusCoronavirus Northern Ireland: five further deaths and  new casesTop VideosPlayArlene Foster calls for PSNI chief to quit over handling of Bobby Storey funeralPlayFootage shows antisocial behaviour in Belfast#s Holyland PlayCall for ‘accountability’ for Sinn Fein leadership over Storey funeralLatest Northern IrelandLarne Port worker and family relocated after loyalist threatBobby Storey funeral: #Ambiguity# of Covid regulations to blame for prosecutions decision, says Byrne Confidence in police in NI at all-time low after Storey funeral – Arlene FosterHealth Minister Swann to receive Covid jab as over-s included in rolloutMan in his s dies in M crash Latest from Belfast Carl Frampton#s #ego# lesson against Josh Warrington will help inspire success against Jamel Herring, says Jamie MooreVideo: The complete guide on how to cut your hair at home in lockdownLarne Port worker and family relocated after loyalist threatBobby Storey funeral: #Ambiguity# of Covid regulations to blame for prosecutions decision, says Byrne Labour loses bid to have Anas Sarwar’s name on ballot papers,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The Redcastle hotel is located in the once proud and independent peninsula of Inishowen. The last of the Irish chieftains with whom this site is associated was Cahir ODoherty. Cahir became chieftain at the age of  in , after the death of his father, Sir John O Doherty. In order to secure his position, Cahir changed his family’s side in the Nine Year War year and swore loyalty to Queen Elizabeth, because of Inishowens important strategic location and the defeat of the Confederates at Kinsale in . googletag.cmd.push The war ended in . It resulted in the Flight of the Earls from Rathmullan in  and the Plantation of Ulster. Cahir thought his reward for his help and loyalty would be great. But apart from being knighted and acquiring the title Sir, he was to be disappointed. In frustration the -year-old chieftain rebelled in , sacking the English held city of Derry and burning it to the ground. He was killed shortly after this in the Battle of Kilmacrennan, just outside Letterkenny. Because of this rebellion King James I ordered the great walls of Derry to be built. After Cahir, the last Inishowen Chieftain, was killed, all his lands in Inishowen were seized by the James I for plantation and ided between The Established church and Arthur Chichester. The two separate entities that were then Inishowen and Tyrconnell were joined and made into one county. It was named Donegal. googletag.cmd.push The first house built on the site of the Redcastle hotel was built by the Carey family. The Cary family were landlords who received plantation lands from Moville to Muff. The family lived here from about  to , almost exactly  years. Unfortunately for the Careys, they had money problems and eventually were forced to sell the Redcastle house and Estate in . Thomas Doherty from Muff purchased the house from the Careys, but because of legal issues it took  years for them to complete the sale. The most famous of the Careys was Joyce Carey. Joyce Cary was listed in the top  writers in English by The Sunday Times. Some of his books were made into film. His son and grandson continued in the creative theme and were involved in TV series such as Dr Who and Captain Pugwash.     Thomas Doherty left the estate to his youngest daughter, Jane, who was married to Dr Richard Doherty, a lecturer in midwery in Queens University, Galway. Dr Richard Doherty died in  and his we Jane in . Richard converted to Catholicism late in his le and left the Redcastle estate to his daughter, Elizabeth and her husband Captain Ernest Cochrane, on the condition that the children be brought up as Catholics. The year before Elizabeth died she was in dispute with the local land league on the reduction of rents. Armed men were employed to secure her crops after locals refused to harvest them. They were unsuccessful at getting the crops harvested, but it is said they did get through quite an amount of Jameson whiskey and food. Captain Ernest Cochrane was the son of the famous and notorious Lord Thomas Cochrane, on which the films Master and Commander and Hornblower are based. Earnests famous bloodline does not end there as he is also a descendent of Robert the Bruce who actually invaded and occupied Northburg Castle in Greencastle for a short period. True love must have been very much in the air as the condition that Richard Doherty left for marriage and inheritance at this time would have been quite a diplomatic feat, given that Earnest was also the high sherf of Donegal. But they managed it. Captain Cochrane went to church in his Model T car. Reg number Hand Elizabeth and her children in their horse and carriage to Drung Chapel. To this day they are still separated, Earnest in a grand monument grave in front of the now derelict Church of Ireland Church in Redcastle. Elizabeth Francis with her children and her parents are interred at the alter area of the old Catholic Church, Drung. After the ious land acts that were introduced after , landlordism went into terminal decline. Lands were sold off and the large houses were either left to rot away or knocked down to avoid taxes on them. Redcastle House survived. Captain Earnest Cochrane died in  and Elizabeth Francis in . The Cochranes remained and turned their hand to farming and in the s opened the Redcastle House as an Hotel. The Cochranes sold Redcastle in  and the hotel is now once again back in the ownership of a Doherty.

There is not a girl woman anywhere who doesnt like a piece of jewellery or an aromatic fragrance. You could include a few men in that, too! Among them are two young Derry girls who love all things glittery and sparkly – and a nice fragrance – so much so, they have used their time during Covid- lockdown to start up their own fragrance business. Sisters Mia, , and Bella Doherty, , from Cornshell Fields in the Ballyarnett of the city, named their enterprise Jewelled Aroma by Mia Bella- a combination of their names – and after almost a year of research, trials and checking out regulations, they have their enterprise up and running. googletag.cmd.push At the minute, they are making wax melts of ious fragrances and shapes along with room sprays to match the wax melts smells. They are also currently looking into other products as well. Mia, who attends St Marys College, said they began researching soon after the Covid- restrictions were introduced in March last year. She added: “We undertook online courses in candle-making tohelp our wee idea become a reality. “We tried out dferenttypes of soya wax andfragrances with our family being thetesters, much to their delight for a goodfew months. “We wanted to be % happywith our product before we decidedthey were ready for purchase.So the launch of Jewelled Aroma by Mia Bella began last month. googletag.cmd.push “We are both currentlyusing our mum’s kitchen but she doesn’tmind as we clean up after ourselves and her house always smells solovely for her. “Also, by law, we have to follow certain regulations, so have to ensure CIP labels are made for every fragranceoil and then bepresently packaged. This can all take a lot of timebut we really love being creative and by adding glitter and colour and trying out dferent designs makes our wax melts stand out compared to others.Having nice packaging and how they are presented is very important to us “We make wax melts by melting soya wax and adding fragrancesoils and pour into moulds, although this sounds very straight forwardthere is temperature taking anda few step-by-step instructions that need to be adhered toin order to maintain a good quality product that will last.”     Despite the success and the enjoyment of making fragrances, Mia said she was looking forward to going back to school. “St Mary’sis a fantastic school and I love getting up to go to school every morning.” She admitted she was a bit concerned about how much catching up she will have to do but said she was sure the teachers would put everyone at ease when they were all back in the classroom. “We definitely missed schoola lot,especiallynot seeing our friends was dficult but starting this business has helpedkeep us occupied and easeanyboredom. “Learning our craft and keeping upwithschoolwork has made the wholeCovidsituation fly in for us. Weare so busy at the minutewith orders for delivery that our mum had to help out as well. She is able to help at the minute as her business is currently closed due toCovid- restric- tions.She was a great help at the start as she was able to guide us in the right direction - we have even roped dad into helping by doing the deliveries.” She added: “I hope we go back to normality as I like the hands on physical activities at school like technology and science experiments.” Bella, who ed to P at Steelstown Primary School on Monday last, said despite the enjoying of producing Jewelled Aroma by Mia Bella products, school work was her priority. “I was a bit nervous about ingto school but it was great. I have a new teacher and she is really lovely. It was great seeing all my friends as well. This is my last year in primary school so I am really happy to be getting backto see everyone before I have to make the transition to secondary school.” Bella said they had been inundated with very positive reviews for their range of products. “Everyone seems to love the product going by the lovely messages we receive.Customers wish us every success andfor more orders so this makes us very happy. “When we are back at school full-time and not able to commitour time as much to the business as school is the priority, my aunties are willing to help out to keep us well stocked up with our products. “The people in our cityand beyondhave been really supportive inshopping local, it feels good to know we’re doing something right.” The girls mother, Maria, is understandably so proud of her two girls, being the owner of Miabella beauty salon next to the car wash on Racecourse Road in Shantallow which has been closed for nine months of the past year. She said: “If there’s one thing I can take from lockdownis that I work too much and the girls missed me, so spending quality time and helping them out with their wax melts was amazing. I’ve learned so much from them and how much of a work ethicis instilled into them, “I am so proud of them both andhow they have juggled both school work and their newly established business. “They both are managing perfectly so farand I can go back to work and know they are perfectly capable of staying on top of orders. “As their mum, though, I will keep on top of the social mediato ensure their safety - their page is linked to my phone so I can keep them safe.” Maria conceded she has found lockdown extremely dficultat times. She added: “I really miss my clients, as a lot of them have become friends over the years. It’s always good to catch up with each other.I’m so looking forward to seeing each and every single one of them when I canalthough trying to fit everyone in will prove to be a dficult task. “Somehow, I’ll man- ageshould I work night and day to get you all beautied again.I don’t like to disappoint anyone when they look for appointments, my clients are lovely and are very understanding.” So Chanel, Jimmy Choo and Gucci, take note of the name - Jewelled Aroma by Mia Bella.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Sinn Fein Foyle MLA Martina Anderson said she had been contacted recently by several people about the amount of droppings on the walkway along the lower deck of the bridge. The walkway is being used even more nowadays given the amount of people who are out walking during the pandemic lockdown. Ms Anderson said she was concerned that someone could be hurt by the serious public health risk posed by the pigeon droppings. She has asked Derry City and Strabane District Council and the Department of Infrastructure, which is responsible for the bridge, to look at the problem. googletag.cmd.push She has the agencies to look at ecologically friendly ways of preventing pigeons from roosting on the bridge. In the past few weeks I have been contacted by people using the under deck of Craigavon Bridge disgusted at the amount of pigeon droppings in and around the walkway and railings there. There are sections of railings covered in the stuff. Its clearly a health hazard, so its vital that its cleaned as soon as possible. googletag.cmd.push  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The second main element of the business case would be a further request that the British government continues to provide % of the funding required to maintain the air route from Derry to London. The government has already said that it will continue to cover the cost of the London route through a Public Service Orderuntil . googletag.cmd.push PSOs provide funding for air routes which are seen as vital for the economic development of the region they serve. The new business case from the council asks the British government to continue fully funding the London route after . Another key aspect of the business case, Mr Dallas said today, was negotiating with the Irish government to create a PSO air route between Derry and Dublin. Mr Dallas said the council had received signicant support from the British government and the Northern Ireland Executive to cover the losses at the airport as a result of the pandemic. However, in relation to the long-term future of the airport, he said the council could not continue to subsidise the facility at the current rate.     “The need for government intervention at this point is critical,” said Mr Dallas. The councils chief executive, John Kelpie, said a lot of hard work had gone in to the preparation of the business case. “If this application to government or governments is successful it will signicantly reduce the financial challenge on council and the responsibility for the sustainability of the airport will become a shared responsibility with the council and our partners in government. “Clearly the journey ahead to reach that point will be challenging. It will require a lot of hard work to progress our case but it is actually very encouraging at this stage even in advance of producing this report to government that we have seen a number of positive engagements from government over the last number of months.” Councillors at todays meeting unanimously supported a proposal that council officers now urgently communicate with the two governments in relation to the new business case for the airport.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

My Department is committed to maximising Fort George’s potential and is delighted to work with the Trust to accommodate this ambitious development which will deliver key health services to the community in Derry.” The department says that the development of a Cityside Health and Care Centre is anticipated to create  new permanent jobs as well as centralising approximately  posts in a modern state of the art facility. googletag.cmd.push The positions will include nursing, social work, allied health professional and administrative roles as well as the relocation of a number of GP surgeries. Health Minister Robin Swann welcomed the proposed new centre. “This is an important step towards ensuring the delivery of high quality integrated primary and community care services within the city-side of Londonderry, and also towards improving the health service infrastructure within Northern Ireland. I recognise the efforts of all concerned in securing the site for this new facility and my Department will continue to support this project as it moves to the next stage.” Alan Moore, Director of Strategic Capital Development with the Western Health and Social Care Trust,said: “The Western Trust welcomes the decision by the Department for Communities Minister to agree to the sale of part of the Fort George site to the Western Trust.

In short, it could be deemed a reduction in terms of ambition.     I am of the opinion that this strategically important development site would be better utilised for something that adds real value economically to the city and beyond. “However, that being said, I am acutely aware of the challenges facing our health service pre-pandemic. A system already at breaking point has struggled under the weight of the past year- this state-of-the-art facility will I hope, take pressure off that system and ensure the effective delivery of integrated health services for the surrounding areas. The creation of  permanent jobs is also good news, particularly in conjunction with the transfer of Health Sciences to Magee University, which I hope will encourage more students to train and remain.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The site is owned by the Department for Communitieswho is leading on its regeneration. There has been many years of debate over what the prominent riverside should be used for. However, to date, only a large office block has been built on the land. After an Expression of Interest exercise, DfC entered an agreement with the Western Health and Social Care Trustso that they could further develop their proposal for the health and care centre to be located on the site. googletag.cmd.push Communities Minister Deirdre Hargey said: “Fort George is a strategic regeneration site that has huge potential to create real social and economic benefits for the City of Derry and beyond. “I am delighted to announce that I have agreed to provide part of the site to the Western Health and Social Care Trust for their Health and Care Centre. My Department is committed to maximising Fort George’s potential and is delighted to work with the Trust to accommodate this ambitious development which will deliver key health services to the community in Derry.” The department says that the development of a Cityside Health and Care Centre is anticipated to create  new permanent jobs as well as centralising approximately  posts in a modern state of the art facility. googletag.cmd.push The positions will include nursing, social work, allied health professional and administrative roles as well as the relocation of a number of GP surgeries. However, SDLP Foyle MLA Mark H Durkan has expressed reservations about the proposal for the Fort George site. “While it would be foolish not to see the merit in a new health hub, particularly in the current climate, Fort George is perhaps not the most suitable location, said Mr Durkan. “People will no doubt see this announcement as falling short of earlier proposals, promises and plans. In short, it could be deemed a reduction in terms of ambition.     I am of the opinion that this strategically important development site would be better utilised for something that adds real value economically to the city and beyond. “However, that being said, I am acutely aware of the challenges facing our health service pre-pandemic. A system already at breaking point has struggled under the weight of the past year- this state-of-the-art facility will I hope, take pressure off that system and ensure the effective delivery of integrated health services for the surrounding areas. The creation of  permanent jobs is also good news, particularly in conjunction with the transfer of Health Sciences to Magee University, which I hope will encourage more students to train and remain.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

This is the daunting schedule facing Connor Coyle next week as he steps into the ring for the first time in  months. The Derry middleweight will fly to Mexico for the equivalent of a long weekend as he aims to get his professional career back on track in . The -year-old, who is -, has not been in action since January last year when he defeated Miguel Dumas, and he is eager to get going once again. On April th, he will step into the ring in Chihuahua, Mexico against hometown boxer Esteban Villalba , after a break of  days due to the effects of the coronavirus pandemic. googletag.cmd.push It has been a long, long wait for Coyle, who has never stopped training in the hope that he would get the phone call for his next fight. “I didn’t think I would have been out this long. I’m just happy that there’s now something in front of me,” he said. “It’s completely dferent when you have a focus. I haven’t stopped training since my last fight but you push yourself to a dferent level when you have a fight in front of you. You feel a massive dference in the gym when you now you have a focus, especially trying to get your weight down. googletag.cmd.push “You need that motivation and that hunger to be training for something. The excitement is there and I have a lot more energy because I am pushing myself for something, rather than just ticking over and training to keep myself in shape. Because I haven’t stopped from my previous fight, that helped keep the momentum up whenever I really had to put the head down.”  Daunting Schedule There is no doubting that Coyle faces a dficult schedule next week. He has very little time to adapt to the change in setting, with what plans to be a hectic few days, with just two days in Mexico before he steps into the ring.      “I’ve never done this before,” he admitted. “I know when I travel to Florida I arrive at night time and sleep that night so I’m up fresh the next morning to go training. This is basically going to be the same thing. I’m flying over at night-time so when I get over I’ll be able to get some rest and get up and weigh in and rest again until the fight. I don’t think I’ll have any problems because it’s straight over and back. I’ll probably feel it coming back because it will catch up with me but on the way over I think I’ll be okay.” Villalba will be Coyle’s third Mexican opponent in succession, but despite a rather inconsistent record, the Derry man is expecting this particular Mexican to be on a dferent level. “I don’t know too much about him but I know he’s a tough operator and he’s very, very durable,” he explained. “We’re fighting in his home town so he’ll have no travelling to do, he’ll get up out of his bed and go and weigh in, or go and fight or whatever. He’ll be well rested. “All Mexicans are tough operators so I’ll be going into the lion’s den in this one and I’ll be expecting hard rounds, so hopefully we can get him out of there early. My last two opponents were Mexican, but this guy takes it to another level. He’ll be tougher.” Ultimately, the goal for Coyle is to get back to America, with this fight seen as something of a warm up for the real action when he gets back to the States. “They are making it very dficult with the travelling and the restrictions so I’m going to try and make the most of it when I go where and stay for a few fights,” he stated. poundIf all goes well and I go over in August or September, I’ll possibly stay until Christmas time and get in as many fights as I can until then.” Sponsors Connor would like to thank the following sponsors for their continued support, especially during such a dficult time. They are: Thirsty Goat, Celebrity Slots, Classique Floor Designs, Central Site Development, Doire Designs, The Bentley Bar, Conor Curleys Cars, Frankie Ramseys, Brooklands Fencing, Archibald Construction, RB Tiling Services, Pauls Butchers and Olympus Fitness. He would also like to give a huge thanks St. Josephs Boxing Coach Cahir Duffy for the last  weeks of training as well as Strength and Conditioning coach Kyle Wallace.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Bishop McClay and Dean Hull celebrated a simple service of Holy Communion before walking prayerfully from Saul to the Cathedral.Meanwhile, pilgrims at home were invited to take a virtual prayer pilgrimage with Glynis Matchett with a short film premiered on social media.The pilgrimage is inspired by Patrickrsquos journey from slave to missionary and reflects on his faith and passion for the gospel.At noon Dean Hull welcomed viewers to a live broadcast from Down Cathedral, with the Bishop leading the service.The guest speakers included Patrick Regan and singerndashsongwriter and Andy Flannagan who also joined in via video.Conscious that the past year has seen many thousands of people face traumatic situations and signicant mental health issues, the diocese had chosen the theme lsquoWhen Faith Gets Shakenrsquo for the service.Patrick Regan is the author of a book by the same name and founder and chief executive of mental health charity Kintsugi Hope which aims to create safe and supportive spaces for those struggling with emotional and mental health challenges.He is also the founder of urban youth work charity XLP and the author of five books. Patrick has travelled widely working with and on behalf of the poorest communities and is a regular contributor on radio and television on issues of poverty and justice.Andy Flannagan is a Lutonndashbased, Irish singerndashsongwriter who was previously a hospital doctor.His campaigning song writing drew him into the political arena, and he is Executive Director of Christians in Politics. One of his driving passions is to see a just rewiring of the global economic system.Drawing on their own experiences, Patrick and Andy encouraged people to be honest with God in lament and to trust that he brings beauty from their brokenness.Andy sang two pieces ndash Fragile and a song of complaint based on Psalm , while soloist, Ruth Thompson, sang two songs ndash What Grace is Mine and Christ Be Beside Me ndash accompanied by Cathedral organist Michael McCracken.Following the service, clergy gathered at St Patrickrsquos grave for a socially distanced wreath laying ceremony.And in keeping with the focus on mental wellbeing, the wreath was laid by Mr Jackie Breen, a senior mental health nurse based at Finneston House in Downpatrick..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/24March2021-Chief.jpg","title":"Chief denies Finneston House closure claims  ","story":"THE districtrsquos most senior health chief has categorically dismissed rumours that a key facility based in Downpatrick is to close at the weekend.Finneston House mdash run by the South Eastern Trust mdash is based at the Ardglass Road on the outskirts of the town and provides an acute mental health community service.Last week, a number of councillors posted on social media that they had been made aware of reports that the facility, which has a long history as a base for mental health services, was to close at weekends with services moved to Belfast.Dispelling the rumours during a special briefing with local politicians on Monday afternoon, Mr Seamus McGoran said there were ldquoabsolutely no plans to close Finneston House which, he said, was line for a pound, investment to support the continued delivery of mental health and other community services.Mr McGoran, acting chief executive of the South Eastern Trust, said he was more than happy to set the record on the future of the mental health facility.ldquoThere are absolutely no plans at all to remove the weekend mental health service from Finneston House and relocate to Belfast, he declared.He said he was ldquosomewhat irked that some councillors had chosen to put out a statement on social media last week saying that he had received ldquodisturbing reports that the health trust was going to transfer the service.ldquoThis is absolutely not true and I would preferany of you [councillors] have issues or concerns that you would ask the Trust about them, continued Mr McGoran.ldquoWhat happens is your hear rumours and treat them as fact and start making statements on the back of that. We have an obligation to communicate responsibly with the public and we have an obligation not to create anxiety with the very people who need to access our mental health services.ldquoFinneston House will continue to be there andthere is more demand for the service it provides we will put more resources into it. That will be how we deliver the service, he said.ldquoI donrsquot know where these rumours came from and I would make a plea to please talk to us before starting putting stuff on social media.

the scheme would be contrary to rural landing policy and thatpermitted, the design, layout and landscaping of the scheme would be unacceptable.They also ruled the development would harm he privacy of

He said she declined.ldquoThis scheme has been shovel ready for some time, the MP continued.ldquoIndeed, all the geotechnical surveys, public consultations and the legal stages have been complete and in order many months ago. Yet the Minister refuses to sign-off on a commencement order.ldquoThe failure to even provide a detailed, logical explanation as to why she has not yet signed off on this scheme has created a growing fear in the local community that she is inexplicably stalling on this eagerly awaited project.The MP said that once again last weekend Ballynahinch suffered chronic congestion, with cars queued for miles to get through the town on Sunday evening as people ed home from visiting the area.Mr Hazzard warned that this will be a scene repeated each and every weekend and in the opposite direction each weeknight as commutershome from work outside Ballynahinch when Covid- restrictions ease again in the time ahead.Slieve Croob councillor Cathy Mason, who is also calling for a start date for the bypass, said the ldquotimely delivery of the long overdue roads scheme would be a great boost for both the local economy and the wellbeing of the community.She added: ldquoThe Minister must bring this issue to a speedy conclusion as soon as possible, sign the commencement order and announce a date for construction to commence.

Itrsquos a point that anglers disagree with.DERA explained the work on the banks of the river created two dedicated disabled parking spaces in the car park where previously there had been none.ldquoThere was no legal requirement to consult on the proposed improvement works and therefore the consultation undertaken went beyond what was required, to specically noty as well as seek comment and feedback from site users, said a departmental official.He also confirmed that notice of DAERArsquos intention to carry out improvement work was clearly displayed at the Quoile site in advance of it being undertaken.The official also confirmed that consultation on the car park investment was initiated with Newry, Mourne and Down Council and a number of local councillors who were contacted by telephone about the proposed investment.DAERA confirmed that regular tree inspections are carried out at the Quoile River and that after storms, areas of the Quoile Nature Reserve are checked by staff for fallen trees and branches that may have come down.In addition, it says this area is subject to regular visual inspections by staff and where any concerns are identied, advice will be sought from qualied tree surgeons or arboriculturists any necessary work carried out.In his letter to anglers, the DAERA official said he appreciates that it was not satisfactory for disabled anglers to make their way to access current angling facilities a quarter of a mile from the car park, confirming plans for two new educated stands to meet the needs of those with mobility problems.A spokesman for Downpatrick anglers said they have never suggested that there was a dedicated disabled fishing stand at the car park before it was redeveloped. He said fishermen could fish in the river at the car park from their wheelchairs as there was a small wall in place.ldquoSince the car park was redeveloped, a barrier has been attached to the wall which now makes it impossible for disabled anglers to fish from this location. As a result, they have to make their way, along with all their gear, to another stand which is a quarter of a mile away, he said.ldquoThis is highly unsatisfactory. Would it be proper to tell someone with mobility issues who stops in a car park to be told that the shopping centre, GP surgery or disabled toilet that they needed to visit was half a mile away  I suspect not.The spokesman added local anglers have been told about plans for disabled fishing stands at the car park for some time now and that the Environment Agency is being asked for its view.ldquoWhat we want to see is delivery for disabled anglers. They have rights which must be recognised, he said.The spokesman added: ldquoWe remain in the eye of a pandemic and mental health is a major issue for many health professionals who are concerned about the fall-out from the impact of the coronavirus. Fishing is very therapeutic and we would strongly argue that the provision of new disabled angling stands on the banks of the Quoile should be a priority and will be of tremendous benefit.Anglers have also expressed concern that the redeveloped car park on the banks of the river has become a magnet for anti-social behaviour are are thankful that no one was injured when a large branch fell to the ground several weeks ago.

It may not be everyonersquos cup of tea but the basis is traditional with very modern elements.Richard did not seek out entry to the competition rather the producers came to him.He said: ldquoI was approached by the programme makers through Instagram which is a surprise as even though Irsquom an interior designer, I donrsquot toot too much about my own house.ldquoNormally they would have come out to see the house before it was selected but because of Covid I had to give them a video tour of the house and they said they would be delighted to feature it.Neither Richard nor his mother were allowed to be at home when the three judges called to view the house lastSeptember, but he revealed the filming took two days in total.ldquoThe judges never meet the home owners as the house should speak for itself, he said.ldquoIt was a real experience as therersquos a lot of prep that goes into it. Therersquos a lot of disclaimers and I wasnrsquot allowed to talk about it until the week before. It involved the support and help from my neighbours who have been absolutely lovely.He added that his Basset dog, Walter, stole the show and has ended up appearing in the programmersquos opening credits every week.For further information, visit Richardrsquos website, www.rodrickdesign..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/24March2021-Strangford.jpg","title":"Strangford buzzing as film crew rolls in  ","story":"TELEVISION cameras rolled into Strangford last week.The village was buzzing recently when a TV advert production company visited a well-loved local hostelry.The recently refurbished Cuan bar and restaurant, is to star in new Tourism NI advert encouraging people to explore the region for staycations this year.The Cuanrsquos customer experience and Business development manager, Michael Dune, said the visit was very welcome.ldquoThe village was definitely buzzing with a film crew and it was great to be chosen to help represent the local area in what is likely to be a new TV advert, he said.ldquoThe attention was certainly very welcome as The Cuan changed hands last year but we havenrsquot been able to open since so the owner decided to do a major refurbishment which is almost complete.

People have definitely been watching the services and I know itrsquos a comfort that they have been able to worship in some form.He added: ldquoThere was a palpable sense of joy when we were reopened following the end of the first lockdown last July.

One of the first things we did after the lockdown was to move things online, but itrsquos not the same as being able to see each other, he remarked.ldquoWe have tried to keep things going as best we can, but there are limitations to what you can do, such as with hospital visits.

The protocol has been forced upon the people of Northern Ireland and although totally rejected by the unionist population the Westminster government cast aside their supposed allegiance to the Belfast Agreement and defiantly sought to implement something that drove a coach and horses through it. To add insult to injury the government have decided to force the most rigorous abortion laws upon the people of Northern Ireland without their consent, and over the heads of the elected members of the Northern Ireland Assembly, of course once again to appease republicanism and Sinn Fein’s agenda.    \" fill\"#ea\"  to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

No one can deny there are two dferent policing policies being carried out in Northern Ireland. During this pandemic I and the vast majority of law abiding citizens have buried our loved ones with dignity, abiding by the rules emanating from Stormont. This has caused much added heartache and grief but because of our willingness to stop the virus and save lives we abided by the rules. Yet I know in the Mid Ulster, the deputy first minister Michelle O’Neill’s constituency and neighbourhood, we witnessed the constant breaking of these rules by republicans. There was however little or no police presence, no vehicles with cameras to gather evidence and little mention of prosecutions. For some unionists who broke the rules the police and other evidence measures were present and interviews, I believe, followed. Yesterday we witnessed the most sickening decision that there will be no prosecutions for what happened at Bobby Storey’s funeral. My view is that there was a disgraceful and blatant breach of the rules by republicans but O’Neill and the Sinn Fein leadership are not to be prosecuted The Director of Public Prosecutions should resign. It seems that the shadow of republicans ing to ‘what they know best’ hangs over the British government and we are all expected to join the policy of appeasement or remain silent. That I will not do.The unionist community has had a bellyfull of republican appeasement and the time has come when Sinn Fein has to know that unionists are not acquiescing with their agenda. It is now time for unionism to collectively say to the Westminster government and Sinn Fein that our community deserves respect and equality and that the republican agenda will be strenuously resisted both at Stormont and Westminster. The time for fine words is over and unionism will rise to the challenge.• Lord McCrea of Magherafelt and Cookstown is a DUP peer——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

The little red radio is at the far side of the room, beside the kettle and toaster and carpet of crumbs. Turning it on involves getting up from my spot, which is an easier task for me to write about than accomplish.It follows that often when I go to the bother of switching the radio on, I let it play for some time after the news bulletin has finished, rather than navigate the obvious trauma of standing up twice within too short a period of time. The radio may play for  minutes, or even , or, on the odd occasion, I let it run for the whole  minutes just so I can hear the bulletin on the next hour without having to endure the ordeal of getting up again.   \" fill\"#ea\"  to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...This means that I consume a fair amount of radio programming in between the headlines. In the morning, Stephen Nolan can often set the news agenda for the day. Lynette Fay’s ‘Kitchen Disco’ in the afternoon usually brings some relief at just the moment when the burden of the day’s labour appears insurmountable.But, more often, I don’t really notice what is being broadcast. I tend to become immersed with my long series of tasks and the radio is just something that is on in the background, at the edge of my consciousness, like a fly buzzing in the corner of the room.This is how it is as I work today. My mind is occupied with a troublesome intro to a story which I am struggling to get right. I try ious alterations but can’t quite seem to find a combination of words which works.I’m only vaguely aware that the radio is playing a song. I have a sense of it being pleasant and soothing. Soon I notice that my foot is tapping and my fingers drumming across the surface of the mouse mat. I force my focus back towards my work.I hear a voice. It speaks of being ‘on your nerves!’, of a ‘wee woman with the big stick’, of ‘the cream buns’. I smile inside and sink back into my chair, perhaps drawing comfort from the familiarity of the tone.Suddenly I sit up straight. I have just realised what is happening.‘Good ******, I’m listening to Hugo Duncan!’Actually, it’s worse than that. We’ve all heard a bit of Hugo at some point or other. What has shocked me is that I was enjoying it. I shoot out of my chair, forgetting my previous physical lethargy, and walk quickly around the room, shaking my head repeatedly. How has it come to this I begin to mutter under my breath.‘No…it can’t be so…it can’t be so.’I turn the radio off and brusquely instruct Alexa to play some Thin Lizzy. I have to make things right with the world once more. I go back to my desk, but I’m a little shaken.None of which is to suggest that I have any personal aversion towards the diminutive fellow from a town in the north west. I’ve met Uncle Hugo briefly twice , once at an awards ceremony and once at the BBC’s Broadcasting House, and he was perfectly charming each time.But his show, with its mixture of country music, relentlessly upbeat chatter and mentions of baked goods, is something which has always been off limits. My parents might listen, but I’ve never considered myself the target audience.I think about what has just happened. Perhaps this all represents a mellowing within my soul. When I was an abrasive teenager, musical taste was not so much a matter of preference as one of conditioning. There was no space for ergence or compromise. If you liked my sort of music you were lucky to be one of the chosen people. Those of us who adored the rock guitarist pitied the poor fools who lived in the dark and liked dance or soft pop music.For a young man, credibility with peers could be forged or broken by the contents of your tape or CD collection. Extra points were awarded for the obscurity of your favoured bands , and anything which strayed too close towards mainstream popularity was worthy of solid, hissing contempt.County music was a controversial subject. The anguished, brooding blues of a US artist such as Steve Earle were approved. The anaemic, floating country and Irish melodies of a Daniel O’Donnell were ridiculed as, to quote John Lennon, ‘Granny music’.That was then. Now I’m a middle-aged man more likely to tune into Radio Two than One. While I still like what I like, I have learnt to be tolerant of dferent opinions. My tastes are certainly much broader than they once were - but they have never before been stretched to such far distant limits, to an unknown landscape inhabited by Hugo Duncan and Boxcar Brian.Perhaps there is more to it. Maybe this is another symptom of lockdown, of being trapped in a relentless series of days which mirror each other, which are so unremarkable and banal, with so little iety and colour that eventually our resistance is broken down and we all end up conforming to the same cultural tastes, with a diminished appreciation of artistic iniduality. Possibly, due to the restrictions, I am subconsciously slipping into some Orwellian nightmare of beige unormity, with ‘Flash Your Lights At Me’ as its soundtrack.I go back to work, warning myself to be more careful in the future. But whatit is already too late  I think of my tapping foot and wonderI am irreparably altered. Is this how it will be from now on  As I’m sure I’ve heard someone, somewhere say before, ‘sure, it’s like the wheelbarrow, it’s all in front of you’.  \"       \"  Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up  Most PopularM closed in both directions following serious accidentBobby Storey funeral decision - PSNI Chief Constable Simon Byrne rejects calls from Arlene Foster for him to resign - Arlene Foster announces she is holding press conference within the next hour - Michelle ONeill responds to PPS announcement saying we wanted only to support Bobby’s family as he was laid to restAs Sinn Féin leaders escape sanction for endangering public health, IRA victim in court charged with covid breach in memorial to slain sisterArlene Foster and Michelle O’Neill split head of civil service role, step back from interviewing – and open way for pay hikeYoung driver dies after three vehicle collision on M which closed carriageway - two passengers treated in hospital - appeal for witnessesMost PopularYoung driver dies after three vehicle collision on M which closed carriageway - two passengers treated in hospital - appeal for witnessesSammy Wilson condemns Irish-American ‘crass ignorance and arrogance’ of NI affairsIN FULL: PSNI chief reacts to decision not to charge anyone over Storey funeralShe would do it again - Arlene Foster believes Michelle ONeill would change nothing about how she conducted herself at funeral of Bobby StoreyArlene Foster calls for Chief Constable Simon Byrne to resign                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\" ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-kafWEX sc-feJyhm dbjzDR\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy  News you can trust since Sign in   \"    Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"     NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"     SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"     Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"     LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensPuzzlese-PaperCoronavirusMust ReadRecommendedAdvertise My BusinessPublic NoticesFollow us       \" fill\"#ea\"  to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Boris Johnson advised public buildings, including theatres, to close and mass gatherings to stop.This week,  months on, campaign group We Make Events Cymru, reflects on the impact of Covid- and how the lockdown restrictions has had a devastating effect on their industry.The impact of the announcement back in March last year meant that the UK event sector came to an outright standstill, resulting in events being cancelled, theatre and music shows could not be staged and thousands of Welsh event professionals could not work.We Make Events Cymru, , has spent the last  months lobbying the Welsh Government to highlight the need for continued sector support in order for the events organisers, iniduals and supply chain to survive Covid- restrictions.After a year of campaigning, We Make Events Cymru continues to push for opportunities to re-open the sector in light of the Welsh Government Coronavirus Control Plan , which does not allow gatherings of more than  people in Tier .As a result of many conversations with the Welsh Government, We Make Events Cymru has created a survey to gather the much needed data to evidence the number of people involved in the sector and the contribution they make to Wales and its economy.Stephen Burkitt-Harrington, Director of Production  one of Walesrsquo leading Creative Events Companies, said: ldquoThe Welsh Government has been saying all along that it could not reopen events of any kind without industry specic data. We were surprised to learn that they were not collecting this information though.\"This is why we have put together the biggest survey of our industry ever undertaken in Wales. Companies big and small, venues, events, and every inidual involved in even the smallest way can contribute now.\"By giving us as little or as much as people are prepared to contribute, we can then provide the government with the much talked about data they say they need to see how valuable our wide ranging industry is to the Welsh economy, and how important it is to get it open again as soon as it is safe to.Alongside the survey, the group have also recently launched their own website which gives sector colleagues access to wellbeing and financial advice, access to a database of Welsh event organisers, suppliers and iniduals, as well as a forum to chat and exchange ideas ndash resources that the team believe is vitally important during the pandemic.MORE NEWS:We Make Events Cymru is in regular dialogue with Welsh Government to lobby, and is part of the working party preparing for Covid-safe outdoor and indoor test events. These test events are an integral stepping-stone to get the industry in Wales back working again .Sarah Hemsley-Cole, Director of Cardf based SC Productions and the Lead Coordinator for the campaign said: ldquoWhilst we have to accept large mass gatherings are not possible in  ndash it is essential that we keep up the pressure on Welsh Government to allow covid safe cultural activities in the Summer of .\"We are a creative and innovative sector, and by working with Welsh Government to develop appropriate guidance and to generate factual data and evidence from the test events, we can get performers, artists, technicians and the eco system back to work and audiences back to what they love.Working alongside partners such as Equity, Creu Cymru, BECTU, Cardf Music Board, Cult Cymru, Freelancers Make Theatre Work Freelances Task Force, What About Weddings and The Musicians Union ndash We Make Events Cymru has helped give the industry and events people a crucial voice during these unprecedented times.Following on from the recent budget announcement, We Make Events Cymru acknowledge the essential package of support already received from the UK and Welsh governments, and is pleased to hear of the further support expected with the extension of furlough, additional SEISS grants ndash which now includes newcomers to the industry who started their businesses in the   tax year, as well as the Cultural Recovery Fund.We Make Events Cymru are now waiting to hear about additional financial aid and get a better understanding of how long this relief money is expected to last business and iniduals in Wales.

Within it, Wales plays a signicant role with its tremendous highly skilled workforce, many of whom have now had to ersy to work in other jobs.The impact of the lockdown will be felt within the Welsh events industry for many years to come. Rhys Maule, Managing Director of ProLX Productions in Cwmbran said: ldquoThe loss of extremely talented, hard working and dedicated professionals is really hard to see.\"These people are being backed into a corner as a result of no support and canrsquot see any way out other than to change career and move onto something more secure. Lots of these people feel they may neveras the risk is too great, which is devastating, and the impact on their metal health as a result of this is hard to hear.He added ldquoThe huge number of people falling through the gaps not receiving funding is something that needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency to ensure the future of our industry.The COVID- pandemic has caused many events around Wales and the UK to be cancelled or postponed due the government-imposed restrictions on large gatherings. Among the most prominent events to be affected in Wales in  have been the National Eisteddfod, the Royal Welsh Show, Hay Festival, Abergavenny Food Festival, Cardf Half Marathon, Llangollen International Eisteddfod, Green Man and Ironman.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThe road would link Sycamore Cross on the A with Junction  of the M. A -week public consultation last year raised concerns about the impact on the environment and local communities.Responding to those concerns, the Vale of Glamorgan council has now said transport planners must analyse further how the road would fit in with the new context of Covid- and the climate emergency.In a report to the councilrsquos cabinet, which meets on Monday, March , detailed responses were given to the main concerns raised in the consultation. The cabinet will be asked to approve further analysis, before moving on to writing up a full business case for the road.The case for the road is to improve transport across the region, including to Cardf Airport, St Athanrsquos Enterprise Zone, and new housing developments. It would likely cost around pound million to build, and is dependent on funding from the Welsh Government.However, the proposals have drawn criticism from villagers in Pendoylan whose houses would be knocked down, cyclists using country lanes which could be blocked off, and Coed Cymru which has warned ancient woodland would be felled to make way for the road.Two options for the new road were consulted on: one to the east of Pendoylan and one to the west. The report revealed transport planners are edging towards the western route, as it is better value for money than the eastern one.As well as suggesting further analysis, the cabinet report addressed the main concerns including the impact on the climate, environment, walkers and cyclists, and uncertain future of the financially struggling Cardf Airport.On cycling, the new road would include a segregated lsquoactive travel routersquo for cyclists and walkers, the report said. Country lanes blocked off could have bridges or underpasses for walkers and cyclists to cross the new road.     MORE NEWS:The report said: ldquoThere is currently poor infrastructure and local connectivity by walking and cycling through the study area, and there is potential to implement new cycle connections. An active travel route is an integral component of the concept options.ldquoShould a preferred option progress to the next stage of assessment and a need to block the lanes confirmed, access for non-motorised users to safely cross under or over the bypass would be accommodated as part of the design.On climate change, campaigners raised concerns a new road would increase private car journeys and carbon emissions.Both the Welsh Government and the Vale council declared a climate emergency in , pledging to reduce carbon emissions in an effort to prevent catastrophic increases in global temperatures.A big part of the plan to reduce emissions in Wales is changing how people travel: fewer journeys in private cars and more by walking, cycling and in public transport.The report said further analysis would include a lsquocarbon assessment and climate resiliencersquo report, and would explore how to reduce the carbon impact of the road.It did not mention what these methods could include.Several areas of ancient woodland would have ldquovery large adverse impacts according to the report. But further assessment would examine the exact effects of the loss of that woodland.The report said: ldquoThe environmental assessment would examine the loss of woodland in terms of its use in flood retention, water quality, social value, carbon capture, landscape value and cultural heritage value, as well as its value to bioersity.If the ldquovery large adverse impacts canrsquot be avoided by redesigning the road, new trees could be planted where to compensate for the loss of ancient woodland.This would include moving and replanting some of the old trees and soil.The next stage would also include a wider, detailed environmental impact assessment, and recommendations on how to mitigate potential impacts on the environment surrounding the proposed road.Another concern raised has been the uncertain future of Cardf Airport, which was recently bailed out by the Welsh Government with a pound. million grant.But transport planners pointed to plans to make it easier to get to the airport on foot, by bike, bus, train, and in private motor vehicles.The cabinet report said: ldquoWhile recognising that the basis of future studies would increasingly need to consider the emerging trends and patterns resulting from Covid-, it is understood that the long-term vision of the airport remains at this present time.Responding to the report, campaigners have renewed calls for the Vale council to scrap the plans for the road altogether.A spokesperson for Vale Communities for Future Generations said: ldquoWhy the Vale of Glamorgan council is persisting in wasting public money on keeping this outdated road plan alive is hard to understand. The sheer volume of recent objections to the proposal clearly indicates the public has other priorities.ldquoThe original  Vale council assumption was that the road was needed for better vehicle access to Cardf Airport mdash which was denied by the airport management.ldquoSince then the airportrsquos passenger numbers have shrunk, millions of pounds of public money has been spent by the Welsh Government on propping it up financially and the future of air travel globally is uncertain post Covid  pandemic.ldquoThese are hardly the circumstances under which to continue promoting an expensive and environmentally destructive road building plan that was developed before the Vale of Glamorgan council and the Welsh Government declared a climate emergency in .ldquoIt is time for this plan to be recognised as a prime example of outdated thinking, and finally scrapped so that Vale of Glamorgan council can prioritise spending on environmentally sound projects. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Traders have got to remember that.Residents and friends Tracey Scott and Debra Cooper have enjoyed visiting the unusually quiet beach at weekdays through the pandemic, but said they will avoid the seafront this weekend.ldquoI hope people continue to be weary, Ms Scott, who lives alone at her home in Llandough, said. ldquoBut it seems to me recently people have stopped social distancing as much.ldquoI come here with friends and family sometimes three times a week, but I have to avoid it on weekends now.ldquoThere are just hordes of people not keeping to social distancing rules. Itrsquos a great shame.ldquoI walked with my mother here not long ago and was being bumped into by people. I canrsquot put myself at risk, and I canrsquot put others at risk.ldquoItrsquos so dficult because I live alone and I keep away from people Irsquod very much like to hug. Then someone comes and brushes past me. I know it sounds odd, but you do feel almost violated when that happens.ldquoItrsquos dficult, because I really do want the businesses to thrive here and I would like to support them on the weekends.ldquoMy message to people would be lsquogive it time, and letrsquos play it safe ndash donrsquot all rush at oncersquo.Ms Scottrsquos son and his partner, in their twenties, are also avoiding weekend trips to the seafront due to her son having asthma.Ms Cooper said: ldquoFor months now Irsquove only gone out in the week because it gets so busy. Itrsquos strange ndash the nice weather comes and the residents keep out the way.Hugh Pickford, who owns Pickfordrsquos Gallery and Bar With Rooms on the seafront, says he feels for residents, and itrsquos become dficult for traders to police overcrowding.ldquoItrsquos probably bred by us not being able to open indoors and police the situation ourselves, he said.Social distancing signs remain after the road had to be temporarily closed due to people packing the Esplanade over ChristmasldquoAt the moment people come and get a takeaway and go across the road. The problem is thatrsquos what everyone is doing. It doesnrsquot look great at times. But what can we do ldquoOver Christmas it looked almost like a carnival atmosphere to be honest.ldquoIrsquod like to look on the bright side. The seafront has really seen a revival in the last couple of years. Even at am now Piotr at Stol Coffee draws a crowd here. Itrsquos nice to see.That revival is continuing this weekend too as a new cafeacute opens inside the Pier Pavilion.The new rules mean the Pickfords can open their rooms to all people in Wales again.Hugh PickfordldquoWersquove not had much interest at the moment in the rooms, he said. ldquoPeople booked for April and then cancelled when they realised it was room service only. People donrsquot seem to want to eat off the premises or in their rooms, so thatrsquos hitting us a bit.ldquoWersquore looking forward to the summer. With staycation season likely to be ahead of us, it should be a great place to be.What you saidResidents have been responding when asked what they thought of the new changes.Jo Broad, from Blackwood, predicted: ldquoPeople will go crazy. Of course we need our lives back or at least some sort of normality. The beaches will be full again.ldquoLetrsquos hope people will be sensible, not go crazy, and letrsquos hope for safety, or I think there might be a summer lockdown coming.Newport resident Lisa Edwards said: ldquoPeople need to stop hiding behind the government. We are in charge of our own destiny and we have to resume some normality.ldquoTo do this, we need to be allowed to resume living, but sensibly. Itrsquos people flouting new rules that will cause a second wave.Claire Dunning said: ldquoWaiting for the next lockdown. People will take liberties.
