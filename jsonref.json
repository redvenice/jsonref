She has a new hairstyle and has even toned down her make-up.The insight into Kate’s values emerges in a special edition of The Mail on Sunday’s You magazine today, which reveals how she has become increasingly self-assured and focused on her priorities.A source said: ‘She is very clear on her priorities and the values that guide how she lives and works.

This year’s shortlist offers up a complex array of ideas, from rap as a form of therapy (Dave’s Psychodrama) and baroque deep es into sexuality (Anna Calvi’s Hunter), to woke punk (Idles’ Joy as an Act of Resistance), spaced out astro-soul (Nao’s Saturn) and, of course, a bit of lovely hip-hop informed jazz (SEED Ensemble’s Driftglass).In order to nail these disparate sounds, producers find themselves in a position almost as important as the artist. One such producer has sprinkled his studio magic over two of the 12 Albums of the Year. Working on debuts from both Fontaines DC and Black Midi, Dan Carey – who also runs independent record label Speedy Wunderground – used scare tactics on Dublin-based post-punks Fontaines DC’s Dogrel in order to capture the raw energy of their live shows. With the running order already decided, he broke the prospective album down into three sections of four songs. “Then I made this pact with the band that I’d record each of those parts in one take,” he says, freaking out the young group with such a stark proposition. “Usually you record multiple takes, but with this I said no matter where it went wrong we’d just wipe it and start again. So there was only ever one version in existence. It puts this amazing pressure on the band.” It paid off. The result is a frenetic, visceral thing that practically bounces off the walls.“When you’re trying to capture how something sounds live it’s not just the sonic aspect,” says Carey. “When you’re playing a gig you can’t stop and go back to the beginning. You’re committed to it as soon as you begin. I was trying to bring in a little bit of that.”Carey also wanted to shine a light on frontman Grian Chatten’s storytelling lyrics, so kept his vocal separate from the main thrust of instrumental noise, layering it on top and hardly mixing it into the band’s output. It’s a process Carey used when working on albums by spoken word artist and MC Kate Tempest, which were shortlisted in 2014 and again for the 2017 Hyundai Mercury Prize, but he’d never done it before on a guitar record. “I wanted it to sound like someone singing over something rather than someone singing inside it,” he says. “His lyrics warranted that.”When it came to the spiralling, complex album from south London experimental noise-makers Black Midi, Schlagenheim, a totally different approach was in order. The most unlikely musical group to emerge from Croydon’s Brit School so far according to Carey they offer up “the ultimate psychedelic music experience”.Again, capturing their live feel was a priority, but this was done by pulling their studio takes through crazed-scientist-style modular synths and firing them back at the band in real time. “They’d play a chord but everyone would hear it coming back into the room at a slightly different pitch or very finely looped.” Sure, you’re thinking: “But what does that actually do to the music?” “It emphasises the otherwordliness of it,” says Carey.“Seeing Black Midi live is so overwhelming. I lost my mind the first few times I saw them,” he adds. “But if you want to make a record sound like that – and you’re not in a loud, dark venue – you have to think of other ways of enhancing that.”This year a significant number of shortlisted artists have either produced or co-produced their own records – the 1975, Cate Le Bon and Foals included. Serving as her own executive producer, Nao was also keen to retain full ownership of her second album, Saturn, making sketches of songs on her laptop before taking them into the studio to be finessed by the album’s main producer, Grades. “It’s nice to be with the record from the very start to the very end of it,” she says. “No matter how many other people help you through, you don’t want to give the executive producer role to anybody else because you’re the one who’s going to put the most passion and love into it.”With occasional takes recorded in a cupboard in her bedroom, Saturn was a surprisingly low-tech production, despite its dreamy sound. Aside from a couple of tweaks, Nao left her airy vocals alone too. “I try and stay away from effects, because enough people think my voice is affected anyway,” she says. “People think I use Auto-Tune but that’s actually just the way I sing!”Composer and arranger Jason Yarde – who produced the Cassie Kinoshi-led SEED Ensemble’s sprawling Afro-jazz triumph Driftglass – also knows the importance of keeping things simple. “Jazz by its very nature is about experimentation and finding new things,” he says. “But as much as you can use studio tricks and add effects you might not have live, it’s also important to make sure the band sounds like the band. It’s also about knowing when to have a break and when to have some tea.”Watch the 2019 Hyundai Mercury Prize live on Thursday 19th September, BBC Four - 9pm.

Tom Thorogood explores how the prize continues to elevate the freshest of British and Irish talentThree years ago Skepta stood on the Eventim Apollo stage in Hammersmith to collect the Hyundai Mercury Prize for his landmark album Konnichiwa.At any other music awards ceremony an unsigned rapper beating 11 other artists, including Radiohead and the late David Bowie, to the top prize would be unprecedented. But the Hyundai Mercury Prize isn’t like any other showbiz award show, where the winner is picked months in advance and the decision often has more to do with insider politics than artistry.It’s also an award that’s highly prized by the artists who make the shortlist, regardless of genre. Last year, MC Novelist said he felt like he, “got an A*” for his album Novelist Guy, and indie star Nadine Shah, who bagged recognition for her record Holiday Destination, revealed she was a fan of the award: “If I was to go on Mastermind, it would be my specialist subject.”After making the shortlist with her fourth album, No Shame, pop star Lily Allen – used to making headlines for reasons other than her music – says: “The artist part of me gets lost a lot of the time – being nominated has helped with that immensely.”Tottenham MC and producer Skepta was hardly unknown in 2016 of course, he’d been a pioneering grime artist for more than a decade alongside Kano, Wiley and 2003’s own shock winner Dizzee Rascal (whose Boy In Da Corner also beat a Radiohead album).But Joseph Junior “Skepta” Adenuga was doing things his own way, without bowing to industry pressure or pop trends – he’d made the video for the first Konnichiwa single That’s Not Me for £80 before releasing the shout-along shock of Shutdown.On stage Jarvis Cocker announced his name, comparing Bowie’s Blackstar album to the “black star”, before Skepta spoke about his team and scene.“We’ve travelled the world – no record label, nothing,” he declared. “We just did this for us, but the love is very appreciated. We all won today!”His comments to friends, the industry and the TV audience, in the frenzied moments just after his win, with his parents standing next to him, have echoed through the three years since.UK rap and grime have had many highs and lows in the past 20 years. Since 2016, when Kano’s Made In The Manor also made the shortlist, the scene Skepta helped birth has flourished in the charts, on radio and at award shows, and spawned more innovative sub genres.Headie One, one of the leading UK drill MCs, recently made the top 10 with his single 18Hunna and has collaborated with Skepta on his current single Back to Basics. He’s also a Tottenham native who watched closely when the older MC released Konnichiwa and won the Hyundai Mercury Prize.“I first started noticing grime when I was at secondary school,” he says. “Everyone knew Skepta and Chip were from Tottenham like us. When he won the award I realised it was important for artists to get that recognition.“And now I’ve spent time with him I’ve learned a lot from his attitude and intelligence and the way he can adapt to different genres, the way he did on Konnichiwa.”Twelve months on from Skepta’s win there were four equally adventurous, genre-melding British MCs on the Hyundai Mercury Prize shortlist, all from the same city, yet sounding vastly different to each other.Loyle Carner showcased his introspective storytelling and disarmingly gentle flow on his first album Yesterday’s Gone, Kate Tempest took her poetry to new places on her concept record Let Them Eat Chaos and on his ambitious debut Common Sense, J Hus told his story in brutally honest detail.The fourth Londoner to make the 2017 shortlist was Stormzy with his own debut Gang Signs \u0026amp Prayer, a record that fused gospel, grime and pop influences and propelled him to a double Brits win and this year’s Glastonbury headline slot, where he impressed Worthy Farm with his political Banksy, BMX and Chris Martin-assisted Pyramid stage set.In a break between songs, topless and surrounded by the sunburnt crowd, he passed the baton on – reeling off a list of artists from his scene, and highlighting essential young British rappers to the field and the many millions watching from the sofa.Three of those names read out by Stormzy make the shortlist in 2019 – Little Simz, Slowthai and Dave, whose albums compete against Anna Calvi, Foals, Cate Le Bon, Nao, The 1975, Idles, Seed Ensemble, Black Midi and Fontaines DC. It’s a typically eclectic lineup and one that could produce a shock winner, to invoke the year drum’n’bass collective Roni Size \u0026amp Reprezent’s New Forms won at the height of Britpop.“I talked with Skepta about how he puts together his albums, and it’s hard,” says Headie One. “It’s a lot harder to put out a full album than a single or an EP, and it’s an achievement, a real body of work.”And three decades after the prize began, and just three years since Skepta’s Hyundai Mercury Prize win, this year’s shortlist shows that hard work and the resulting albums are as valued as ever.Watch the 2019 Hyundai Mercury Prize live on Thursday 19th September, BBC Four - 9pm.

She worked as a guitar teacher and a toy shop sales assistant before being signed by Domino Records in 2009. Brian Eno was an early champion, calling Calvi “the biggest thing since Patti Smith” and singing and playing on her debut album. She’s also collaborated with David Byrne, Marianne Faithfull and PJ Harvey producer Rob Ellis. Calvi’s guitar-driven art-rock sound is often described as dark and cinematic, so it’s not too surprising that she’s recently scored series five of Peaky Blinders.Influences: Black Midi’s name comes from an internet music genre the band learned of via YouTube, a video frontman Geordie Greep has said they “haven’t spent more than five minutes watching”. The four-piece experimental rock band initially bonded over a shared love of Talking Heads, Deerhoof and Danny Brown, but that doesn’t mean these acts are “influences” in the traditional sense. According to Greep, “there’s stuff we all like, but it’s not like we all like stuff that we based the band on sort of thing. We’ve tried to keep the band quite distinct from what we like.”Scene: Black Midi formed at the Brit School, the Croydon performing arts institution known for cultivating Adele, Amy Winehouse and Jessie J. They then honed their live skills at Brixton venue the Windmill, a bastion of the south London indie scene. Though they’re hardly typical Brit School alumni, the group acknowledge they owe a debt to their time there. “You do shows every term and stuff,” Greep has said. “So once you get out you’ve got a really good idea of how sound works. It meant we left school, could play at the Windmill and knew how to soundcheck straight away.”Influences: Growing up in Wales in the 90s, Cate Le Bon’s father would make her mixtapes introducing her to seminal artists such as Neil Young and the Velvet Underground. She was also drawn to California rockers Pavement and two leading Welsh bands of the era, Super Furry Animals and Gorky’s Zygotic Mynci. Her shortlisted album Reward grew from a year of “self-imposed isolation” in Cumbria where she spent her time woodworking by day and later, “playing the piano and singing into the night”.Scene: Born in Carmarthenshire, Le Bon’s roots lie in the Welsh indie scene. She first came to prominence opening for Super Furry Animals frontman Gruff Rhys on his 2007 solo tour, then singing on I Lust U, a standout track from Rhys’s electro-pop side project Neon Neon. She’s since released five albums, collaborated with John Cale and the Manic Street Preachers, and co-produced an album by American indie rockers Deerhunter. She’s revered by peers including St. Vincent and Wilco’s Jeff Tweedy, who earlier this year described Le Bon as “pretty much my favourite artist”, going on to say: “I’m mesmerised by her output over the last 10 years.”Scene: Dave is a leading light of the blossoming British hip-hop scene. Fellow London rappers Stormzy and Wiley supported him early on then Dave’s profile grew again when US superstar Drake jumped on a remix of his 2017 track Wanna Know. More recently, the 21-year-old has collaborated with several other London rappers including Headie One, J Hus and Fredo, who featured on Dave’s chart-topping single Funky Friday. This year, Dave has underlined his rising star status with a guest spot on Ed Sheeran’s No.6 Collaborations Project.Influences: Oxford band Foals have cited minimalist composer Steve Reich, indie icons Pixies and innovative dance producer Arthur Baker as influences. Frontman Yannis Philippakis has also said that a “general anxiety” caused by Trump, Brexit and climate change fed into their shortlisted album, Everything Not Saved Will Be Lost – Part 1. “I was listening to the tracks in the pub and I’d I look up and see a pub garden full of people and realise: ‘We’re all in this shitstorm together.’ I felt the songs should deal with that,” he said recently.Scene: Foals formed in Oxford’s indie scene in 2005. Two band members, frontman Yannis Philippakis and drummer Jack Bevan, were previously part of another band, math-rockers The Edmund Fitzgerald, who disbanded when things apparently became “too serious”. Since releasing their debut album Antidotes in 2008, Foals have been shortlisted for the Mercury Prize on three occasions and become seasoned festival headliners. A follow-up to their shortlisted album, the logically-titled Everything Not Saved Will Be Lost – Part 2, is due in October.Influences: Dublin post-punks Fontaines DC are influenced by the Strokes, the Libertines and the Velvet Underground they’ve called the latter “the base point of modern music”. Frontman Grian Chatten has also cited the Pogues’ 1984 debut album Red Roses for Me as a major touchstone for their own shortlisted debut, Dogrel, saying: “It sounds so raucous but at the same time so intelligent.” But the band’s most formative influence could be their hometown. “I think of Dublin and our music as one and the same, because it was written by people who were intensely absorbed by the city,” Chatten has said.Scene: Inspired by fellow Dubliners Girl Band, whom they credit with “modernising” Irish music, Fontaines DC are part of a new wave of Irish guitar bands making music with a strong social conscience. Discussing the scene earlier this year, Fontaines bassist Conor Deegan III said: “There’s so many things going on in Ireland, socially and politically, that for so long were not being talked about. It feels like there’s a coherent voice for our generation again.” Having toured with Shame and Idles, Fontaines DC also have close connections with the UK guitar music scene.Influences: While often described as a post-punk band, Idles frontman Joe Talbot has said they’re really “a product of different things we love”. The Bristol outfit’s shortlisted second album, Joy as an Act of Resistance, is influenced by the Sex Pistols, Interpol and Welsh post-hardcore group Mclusky, plus garage music, grime and jungle. It’s all funnelled into a righteous and rousing call-to-arms which takes on toxic masculinity, class conflict, immigration and Brexit. The end result isn’t anger, said Talbot, but music that’s “all about opening up and being vulnerable”.Influences: Little Simz said her shortlisted album Grey Area was inspired by “just coming into myself a lot more and being a young woman in my mid-20s and still learning about myself”. The north London artist, whose real name is Simbi Ajikawo, has said that listening to grime as a teenager influenced her writing style, but Grey Area also draws from other sources. Produced by her childhood friend Inflo, it incorporates jazz, funk, soul, rock and trip-hop, and includes collaborations with reggae artist Chronixx, folk-rock singer Michael Kiwanuka and electro-R\u0026ampB band Little Dragon.Scene: Little Simz said earlier this year that “people have struggled with finding where to place me”, adding: “And I think that’s also because I don’t even know where I fit.” This doesn’t mean the north London rapper lacks influential and high-profile fans. Two years ago, Kendrick Lamar said she “might be the illest doing it”, and she’s been tapped for collaborations by Gorillaz, Khalid and alt-j. Simz has even toured with Lauryn Hill, whose seminal album The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill was part of her “day-to-day life” when she was growing up.Influences: Neo Jessica Joshua, better known as Nao, grew up in Hackney listening to R\u0026ampB, hip-hop and UK garage, as well as Donny Hathaway, Aretha Franklin and Prince. Conceptually, her shortlisted second album is inspired by astrology’s Saturn return. “It’s this idea that Saturn takes 29 years to orbit from when you’re born and it is the planet of blessings and growth. So by the time you’re around 29, between 27 and 32, something big happens in your life,” 31-year-old Nao says. “You start to rethink everything – old stuff that your parents taught you or ideas that you believed in. It’s like a complete shedding of skin and it can be painful.”Scene: Nao’s unique musical journey means she doesn’t slot neatly into any particular scene. After studying vocal jazz at Guildhall School of Music \u0026amp Drama, she joined all-female beatboxing troupe The Boxettes, who were popular on YouTube. She also put in stints as a backing singer for Kwabs and Jarvis Cocker. When she released her debut album For All We Know in 2016, she often described her sound as “wonky funk”, and she’s since collaborated with Nile Rodgers \u0026amp Chic and Disclosure.Influences: Led by alto saxophonist Cassie Kinoshi, SEED Ensemble is a 10-piece band “combining jazz with inner-city London, West African and Caribbean-influenced groove”. Kinoshi says she’s personally influenced by composers such as Maria Schneider, Duke Ellington and Charles Mingus, and named Driftglass after a collection of short stories by African-American author Samuel R Delany. “This record specifically focuses on interpreting … what driftglass is as an analogy for how improvised music changes and evolves over time depending on its environment,” she says. “Sci-fi, specifically space travel and Afrofuturist references to water and its connection to black history, were also important in its creation.”Influences: Northampton rapper Tyron Frampton, or Slowthai, has varied musical influences ranging from the Beatles to Basement Jaxx, and So Solid Crew to Elliot Smith. He namechecks the Prodigy on Nothing Great About Britain, the title track from his shortlisted debut album, saying: “I am a prodigy – they made me.” He’s also said he related to Radiohead’s Creep during his formative years. His album is an impassioned mix of hip-hop, grime, electronica and punk, so it’s fitting that it features collaborations with both grime icon Skepta and noisenik guitar duo Slaves.Scene: Tyron Frampton, the rapper better known as Slowthai, was born and raised in Northampton. “It’s always been a band town,” he said earlier this year. “There’s always been good music but never a strong scene to keep it going.” His own music mixes hip-hop grit with a scabrous punk energy, but he’s keen not to be pigeonholed, saying: “I want to play guitar, piano, drums, write songs for other people. I can do punk, I can do indie, but as long as it has my voice, it’ll always be my sound.”Scene: The four members of the 1975 met at Wilmslow High School and started making music at 15. At one point, they operated as a punk covers band, but they soon developed their own genre-splicing songwriting style inspired by everyone from Michael Jackson to My Bloody Valentine. Since signing to indie label Dirty Hit and breaking through with 2013’s self-titled debut, band members Matt Healy and George Daniel have co-written tracks for fellow Dirty Hit artists Pale Waves, The Japanese House and No Rome.Watch the 2019 Hyundai Mercury Prize live on Thursday 19th September, BBC Four - 9pm.

The huge monument was also inspired by the Trevi fountain in Rome, and contains references to Damien Hirst’s formaldehyde shark, Winslow Homer’s Gulf Stream and JMW Turner’s Slave Ship.At a press conference on Monday, Walker said when she first visited Europe she was shocked by the grand scale of colonial-era monuments. “I think as an American girl coming to Europe for the first time as an art student, I was perversely moved by the grandeur of the palaces,” she said. “Because it really is very jarring when you think about what that’s built on the backs of.”Walker said there was a direct comparison between the Confederate statues in the US, which have polarised opinion and triggered a debate about whether they are inherently racist, and monuments to the British empire such as the Victoria memorial. “It’s only really recently that there’s been a concerted national conversation about these monuments, about how they got there and what they mean,” she said.The artist, best-known for her 2014 work A Subtlety, the huge sphinx-like figure she housed in an old sugar factory, told the  the Turbine Hall commission was an “irresistible … grand prize”, and that she had had to educate herself about the history of race and Britain in preparation.Hilton Als, the New Yorker critic and curator of a solo show at Sprüth Magers that coincides with her Tate commission, said Walker was a “social critic with heart” whose work has consistently explored America and Britain’s shared and complex racial history.“One of the things that is powerful about Walker is her work about slavery, and how black people were traded by the British and Portuguese,” said Als. “The African-American relationship to Britain is a very complicated one and she is again examining it in a powerful way.”Walker said both Kehinde Wiley’s newly installed Times Square monument, Rumors of War, which is 8 metres (26ft) tall and references Confederate statues, and her own Turbine Hall commission formed “an interesting moment for monumentality”. “What the Confederate debate and removal of statues from places like New Orleans has done is not just reignited the debate, but unearthed the racism and cruelties that have lived fairly quietly under the surface for some time,” she said.Als said both works addressing Confederate and colonial monuments showed both artists’ desire to engage with contemporary issues.“It’s like James Baldwin said, he never wanted to be in an ivory tower cultivating his talent, he wanted to be out in the world expressing it,” he said. “It’s a continuation of this idea that the artist wants to be in the moment and commenting on the world around them.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2bf49477ed43cc9721e226cc4155a06c185671f3/713_507_3125_1874/master/3125.jpg?width=300\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e546bde1769a76551e235b3446931645","title":"crispin odey denies backing no deal brexit shorting opportunity","story":"Hedge fund manager says he is optimistic about UK and claims as to motivations are ‘rubbish’Crispin Odey, the hedge fund manager who is a leading backer of a no-deal Brexit and Boris Johnson, has dismissed claims his support is motivated by an opportunity to make millions from short-selling UK companies and the pound as “absolute rubbish”.Odey told the  he was optimistic about the prospects for the UK after Brexit, denied influencing strategy at No 10 and said his fund had an overall “neutral” position on UK stocks.The founder of Odey Asset Management said he had spoken to Boris Johnson only once since he became Conservative leader, “two days after, to say congratulations”. He added: “I am an observer. When it comes to his strategy, I am not involved.”Over the weekend, the former chancellor, Philip Hammond, questioned the political connections of some hedge fund managers backing a no-deal Brexit, and the former permanent secretary to the Treasury Nick Macpherson argued he was right to do so. Responding to the criticisms on Monday, Odey said: “It’s absolute rubbish. It really is. Politics doesn’t drive markets. Markets are very bad at observing political events because they are not monetary.In response to an urgent question from Labour in the House of Commons, the government rejected claims from John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, that Johnson risked a conflict of interest if a no-deal Brexit benefited his friends and donors.“Isn’t there a danger the promotion of a no-deal scare by the prime minister, resulting in profiteering by his friends and donors, could be seen as a conflict of interest by any standard and contrary to the ministerial code?” McDonnell asked.Odey donated £10,000 to Johnson’s Conservative leadership campaign and has given almost £900,000 to pro-Brexit campaigns in the past. The wealth of Odey and his wife, Nichola Pease, has been put at £775m by the Sunday Times rich list.Odey said he supported holding a general election, arguing “the problem is that this parliament was never set up to deal with Brexit”.A fresh election, he said, might result in a parliament that was “more closely aligned to opinion in the country, so not 80:20 but 50:50. It is not good for the country that we live on a knife edge every single day and everyone wants to postpone.”“Most people’s view of the UK is that ‘it’s not going to get any better’. My view is that, if we get out, we will have all this invigoration of things we have got to do, including reforming the constitution. There are parts to the constitution that need reform, including the upper house, which is far too large,” he said.“The idea that Boris is a tyrant doesn’t make sense, if you look at the experience of his time as mayor of London. He is an enterprise man.”Asked why Hammond and Macpherson might question his motives, Odey responded: “It’s the deep state. They are feeling, for the first time, a little bit frustrated.”He backed a no-deal Brexit, he said, because alternative methods of leaving the EU would lumber the UK with the equivalent of unattractive “non-voting shares”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/381546f116c5113976a961145ba36d260a400d74/0_248_7360_4417/master/7360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=edbc2e09cfa28e5c5f042c1557e65216","title":"wework scraps share sale adam neumann","story":"WeWork has pulled plans for a share sale after ousting its founder and amid investor scepticism over its sky-high valuation. The decision leaves the rental company facing a cash crunch as its new bosses prepare to make deep cuts to stem its massive losses.In a statement, WeWork’s newly installed co-chief executives, Artie Minson and Sebastian Gunningham, said they had suspended the initial public offering to “focus on our core business, the fundamentals of which remain strong”.The pair said they “have every intention to operate WeWork as a public company and look forward to revisiting the public equity markets in the future”.The shared workspace operator had planned to start an investor roadshow earlier this month before an IPO. But the company, which had been valued at $47bn earlier this year, found investors worried by its valuation and by corporate governance issues. It was forced to slash its valuation by more than half.Last week, the co-founder and chief executive, Adam Neumann, was ousted from the company, which was until recently the most valuable startup in the US.Neumann was axed after the Wall Street Journal revealed he had taken $700m out of the company before the IPO. Investors questioned a dual-class share sale that would have given Neumann and his associates total control even after the IPO.Neumann’s eccentric behavior further undermined his position, with reports of marijuana smoking on private jets, tequila shot-fueled meetings, and claims he was working on becoming immortal.WeWork’s new co-chiefs are reportedly planning thousands of job cuts and other cost-saving measures, including the sale of a $60m jet bought last year, as they seek to staunch WeWork’s massive losses. Some 5,000 employees, one-third of the company’s workers, could lose their jobs.The company has amassed losses of $3bn over the last three years and could run out of money some time after the first quarter of 2020, according to Chris Lane, an analyst at Sanford C Bernstein \u0026amp Co. We Co, as WeWork’s parent is called, had $2.5bn of cash as of 30 June and is running through about $700m each quarter.We reported spending $1.3bn in 2018.The company would have raised billions for new spending from the IPO and had been expected to receive loans of $6bn if the share sale had gone ahead at its original price.The company’s cash position is further complicated by a bond offering that We made last year. Under the terms of that deal We must keep at least $500m of cash, according to S\u0026ampP Global Ratings. Last week S\u0026ampP downgraded the company’s bonds to negative from stable.We’s stock market flop is the biggest failure yet for the new generation of tech giants. The company is the largest private tenant in Manhattan and London and is still growing rapidly. But its once enormous valuation has been cut as investors have questioned its claim to be a tech company that runs a “physical social network” and started to value it as a property firm.WeWork rival IWS, which also runs co-working spaces, and is of a similar size to WeWork is valued at just $3.6bn, a third of the $10bn some analysts have claimed We is now worth.The pace of We’s expansion is expected to slow as landlords become more cautious of signing deals with the company. is a tenant of WeWork in the US."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/038d8d7fa0dce0aafaf99bb4a2877f16140095dd/0_494_7360_4418/master/7360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1210c6d08269787975a8e6d6651b19bd","title":"weworks long road to rehabilitation starts with ditching its co founder","story":"Officially the firm’s IPO is on pause but it looks impossible as long as Adam Neumann stays aroundOfficially, WeWork is “postponing” its initial public offering (IPO), or stock market flotation, and could return for another attempt soon. Well, good luck. The uncertain road to rehabilitation looks more like the work of many years.The new co-chief executives, Artie Minson and Sebastian Gunningham, are dropping the right hints about selling the Gulfstream jet and cutting thousands of jobs. One assumes WeWork will also jettison its corporate drivel about “elevating the world’s consciousness” if it now accepts it’s a regular company in the dull world of shared office spaces.Yet the first big task is daunting. WeWork requires money – and quickly. It reported about $2.5bn (£2bn) in cash at the end of June. Halting the signing of new lease agreements can help to make the money last longer than next spring, which was the trajectory in the IPO prospectus. But it still needs SoftBank, the Japanese fund that has been the prime backer, to step up. That transaction has to happen, as opposed to just being talked about.As for profits, last year’s outcome was a loss of $1.6bn on sales of $1.8bn. Would-be investors surely won’t touch the shares until they can see hard bottom-line income that can withstand a market downturn.Still, if the journey is long, it will allow time to remove the co-founder Adam Neumann entirely. He’s been shoved into the chair’s seat, which some seem to believe solves the many governance headaches. It doesn’t. While Neumann is still hanging around, WeWork deserves to be uninvestable for the public markets.Susan Searle, the chair of Woodford Patient Capital Trust, is playing things by the book, merely saying the board is “continuing to evaluate” the position of Neil Woodford as manager of the investment trust.Three months ago, in the aftermath of the crisis in Woodford’s empire, fence-sitting was understandable. It was too soon to ditch a manager who had assembled an esoteric collection of mostly unquoted stocks. But now? Searle needs to prepare the sacking letter.Woodford himself, as ever, was full of apologies in the half-year update but the damage has been done. The crossover in unquoted holdings between Patient Capital and the gated Woodford Equity Income Fund (WEIF) has been a disaster for investors in the former. The shrinking WEIF fund hasn’t been able to support follow-on funding for companies in both portfolios, thereby hitting the value of assets in Patient Capital.More fundamentally, Woodford has made poor bets. The quoted fund has been whacked by steep writedowns in recent weeks on two major investments, energy company Industrial Heat and BenevolentAI. For all his plaintive pleas about long-term opportunities (“It only requires a few of the larger companies in the portfolio to deliver …” ) the fact is that the trust’s asset value sits at 65p versus 100p at launch in 2015.The share price, 44.9p, is even lower for a combination of reasons. First, the market fears more writedowns. Second, outsiders don’t know who will be managing the trust in future.Searle could help to remove the latter problem by getting on with the obvious handover. Woodford had his chance – it’s time to move on.What were they doing in Prudential’s boardroom? Were they too busy counting the fortunes being made in Asia to notice that post-crisis regulators in the UK might one day jump on underhand tactics that could short-change customers?The dates are the astonishing feature of the near-£24m fine for the Pru for “serious breaches” in its annuities business. From July 2008 to September 2017, says the Financial Conduct Authority, the insurer failed to advise customers that they might get a better deal if they shopped around.In the banking world, the scandal over payment protection insurance bubbled away for years before Lloyds threw in the towel in 2011. That affair, you might have assumed, would have served as a prompt for the Pru’s board to ensure their own organisation was squeaky clean when selling a more crucial financial product for customers.As it happens, Prudential at the start of 2013 did reform a system that could almost have been designed to create abuses: it stopped offering sales-linked incentives, such as bonuses and spa breaks, to call-handlers. But the FCA’s report also establishes that as late as 2015 some scripts used by call-handlers were substandard.The Pru got out of the non-advised annuity business in February 2017. So – aside from a total £400m provision – the tale can be regarded as ancient history. Certainly, the demerger of asset manager M\u0026ampG will not be affected. But, as an example of how toxic practices can fester for years in financial services, the main elements are depressingly familiar."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f1b868aa799f95ee35270f7559c4253ff4ccd66f/0_185_2924_1754/master/2924.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=071b51fad74ce2b29e7ea378b4a278e7","title":"hong kong pro democracy movement china","story":"Western governments could have joined the battle against China’s repression. Instead they offered spineless servitudeWho lost Hong Kong? It’s a question that should worry – and anger – western politicians and voters as they watch from afar the slow, merciless strangulation of the former British colony’s courageous pro-democracy movement. Once the grand panjandrums of China’s ruling Communist party have completed Tuesdays national day celebrations, additional, potentially fatal twists of their state security garrotte appear inevitable.The malign nature of Beijing’s looming actions may only be intensified by the large-scale demonstrations planned in Hong Kong to coincide with the People’s Republic’s 70th anniversary. Multiple protests and strikes are going ahead despite official bans, pre-emptive arrests, brutal police tactics and media intimidation. But they look destined to end in more damagingly futile violence, similar to that seen at the weekend.If Hong Kong’s battle for democracy – meaning universal suffrage, direct elections, civil rights, free speech and observance of the rule of law – has not already been lost, it is teetering on the brink. This is not because the hundreds of thousands who backed the protests when they began in June have suddenly changed their view on Beijing’s devious efforts to deepen its control.It is certainly not because the protesters have miscalculated or somehow blown their chance of change. In promoting their demands they have, for the most part, shown dignity, eloquence, restraint, persistence and admirable innovation, for example through “be water” pop-up demos, organic ground-up organisation and alternative peer-to-peer social media. These are future paradigms for global protest.But after four months of epic struggle, what do the pro-democracy forces have to show? Official withdrawal of the extradition bill that triggered the upheaval is their sole tangible victory to date. Meanwhile, increased violence involving a minority of protesters is playing into Beijing’s hands, feeding its false narratives about malign agitators, terrorists and foreign agents.The cause is being lost because, firstly, it was always a grievously unequal battle. China’s rulers, initially taken aback by the scale and intensity of its inhabitants’ alienation, are now moving with growing determination to suppress it, not address it. They can do so with increased confidence because the turmoil has not prompted significant copycat protests in one-party mainland China, as some initially predicted.Beijing is winning because no discernible internal political challenge has emerged to Xi Jinping, China’s paramount leader – even though his inflexible and complacent approach has made matters worse. Xi, a strongman leader who casts himself as a latterday Mao with a little red online book of political thoughts to match, is not backing off. He’s doubling down.Beijing is also winning because Hong Kong is no longer quite the vital financial and commercial hub it once was. It was once the primary gateway to China now the ports of Shanghai, Shenzhen, Ningbo and Guangzhou each handle more container traffic than Hong Kong. Beijing is winning because the painstakingly fabricated “one country, two systems” fudge agreed with Britain in 1997 has not lasted the course. Nowadays it is seen from Beijing as less of an asset, more a liability – an artificial arrangement potentially prolonging mainland exposure to Hong Kong’s subversive ideas.At the time of the British handover, there was optimistic talk about how an emerging China’s growing global economic integration would encourage a political transformation and, with it, Beijing’s gradual embrace of western values and international rules-based systems. Such hopes now appear largely misplaced. What Hong Kong shows clearly are the limits to China’s adaptability – and the Communist party’s undying attachment to political uniformity, not plurality.If Hong Kong’s battle is indeed lost, could the pro-democracy movement – with the odds stacked against it – have reasonably expected any other outcome? Yes, it could. Such hopes were not wholly delusional. As a legal guarantor of Hong Kong’s freedoms, Britain has a duty to stand up to China’s repressive behaviour. But aside from a few carefully phrased diplomatic whinges, it has signally failed to do so. Such weak shilly-shallying is contemptuously dismissed in Beijing.The US counts itself a champion of global democratic values, or did so before Donald Trump took office. Congress has made threatening noises but the White House has taken no substantive action. If the US applies punitive measures to China, they concern unfair business practices – not human rights. In fact, Trump’s ruinous trade war has intensified Beijing’s paranoid sense of a hostile global contest. In such circumstances, any unilateral climbdown, anywhere, is deemed politically unacceptable.Despite waging a trade war, Trump also frequently praises Xi under the mistaken impression that insincere flattery will render him more amenable. Yet the behaviour of other western governments since the Hong Kong crisis blew up has been no less servile. What this spineless dereliction implies for other, similar pro-democracy movements opposed to authoritarian regimes, such as those in Egypt and Russia, or for China’s persecuted Uighur and Hui Muslim minorities, is gravely dismaying.In Washington, London and other capitals, it’s plain that money and power speak louder than democratic ideals, broken umbrellas and bloodied heads. Perhaps it was always thus. Yet if Hong Kong is permanently, definitively lost to democracy, it will be, at least in part, because the west failed to fight for it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1452ac1bfa6c3f7746341599f588649ef209f31a/278_275_3762_2257/master/3762.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5b80d0e51cd4b3aa1d6f28268e798d31","title":"the guardian view on the peoples republic of china at 70 whose history","story":"Seven decades of Communist rule have seen notable advances but at horrific costThe 70th anniversary of the People’s Republic of China, which will be marked on Tuesday by a mass military parade in the heart of Beijing, is less a historical commemoration than a political event. The Communist party of China (CPC) has understood the power of history ever since it seized the reins in 1949: in its earliest days, it encouraged citizens to “recall past bitterness”, to make the New China all the sweeter. Xi Jinping understands history’s importance better than any leader since Mao Zedong. Not long after taking power, he warned his colleagues that “historical nihilism” was an existential threat to the party’s rule on a par with western democracy.The tanks, planes, troops and missiles tell a story: in 1949, the republic’s 17 aircraft were ordered to fly over twice, to make the display look more impressive. This time the west will watch closely as the People’s Liberation Army unveils new missile, stealth and unmanned vehicle capabilities. The PRC has outlived its big brother, the Soviet Union, and outgrown western economies. Yet it now faces new challenges.Many in China are grateful for the party’s rule. It enjoys a level of support that many democratically elected governments would envy, and not only because of its mammoth propaganda and censorship apparatus. The last 70 years have seen extraordinary progress in life, literacy and incomes: hundreds of millions are no longer living in poverty. Yet people were not lifted out of poverty they worked their way out. The party banned the family tyranny of forced marriages, but brought the official tyranny of the one-child policy, and even now polices the womb. The advances came at a terrible and wholly unnecessary cost. The famine sparked by Mao’s Great Leap Forward took tens of millions of lives. Tens of millions more people were hounded in the Cultural Revolution.Even some of those worst affected see cause to celebrate today. Yet many in China are angry, cynical or despairing. The party-state’s cruelties are both vast and petty. In Xinjiang, perhaps 1.5 million Muslims are locked up in camps which the party euphemistically calls vocational training centres. Meanwhile a six-year-old boy is forced out of school because his father has sought to use China’s own law to uphold basic rights.The party-state’s embrace of pomp and majesty itself has a remarkably brittle quality. The military parade is by invitation only nearby residents are under order to keep their curtains closed. Elderly “Tiananmen mothers” who lost their children in the brutal crackdown on pro-reform demonstrations in 1989 have police guarding their homes today.Since the massacre, the CPC has doubled down on “national education”, and the construction of a history in which its central role is not class struggle but putting an end to “national humiliation”. This narrative grows all the more important as the costs of spectacular economic growth – fractured families, grotesque corruption, inequality and environmental devastation – are succeeded by its slowing, and as conflict with the US looms large.Meanwhile in Hong Kong, a huge swathe of the population has shown that not everyone is grateful for the party-state’s rule. The 17-week-long protest movement, and the reaction to it, has in turn has boosted support for Taiwan’s incumbent president, Tsai Ing-wen, in the upcoming elections – undermining Beijing’s hopes.Under these circumstances, the party is promoting its historical message more assiduously than ever, at a time which, though very different from the past, bears distinct echoes of it. The “people’s leader” has overseen growing repression, a resurgence of ideology, and is increasingly invoking the idea of struggle. China is seeking to reshape the international order once more. Xi is already looking ahead to the republic’s centenary, 30 years hence. Might another story be told by then?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ac076fc5cf640ce7317e079eee271e2e839daa67/172_365_4157_2495/master/4157.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c42968560e2f41a96d8791903aeffd4c","title":"tories spending sajid javid","story":"Sajid Javid’s speech was more hyperbole than hard cash. Many announcements crumble under scrutinyLook at the people here in Manchester at the Tory party conference, stare into their eyes and they look much as they always did – ordinary home counties folk, small business people, plus a few sharp-suited would-be spads. Not noticeably odd, yet these party members are the tiny group who have done for their country.Over the past decade, their Brexit fever has packed the Commons with Europhobes. These respectable law and order-minded patriots chose a dishonest, disreputable, disgrace of a man for prime minister, who will trash their constitution, mislead their monarch, and disrespect their judges to use “any means necessary” to get anything he wants. These ordinary people have turned into wreckers of what they used to hold dearest.Observers ask if this party is falling apart in front of our eyes: expelling its MPs, pursuing a no-deal Brexit whose catastrophic effects would render the party unelectable for ever. If they only knew it, the Benn Act – preventing a no-deal crashout at the end of next month – saves them from themselves. Some of the 21 banished will not be kept away: Alistair Burt, Dominic Grieve and David Gauke brave the hissing. Any moderates here stay quiet, expect for one businessman tapping me on the shoulder, despairing at what no deal would do to his company. He handed me a paper. I was amazed to find a timeline of the rise of the Nazis. “That’s how Hitler did it, used the constitution step by step,” he murmured. Even the moderates are extreme.After a decade of the most savage erosion of every service, the pre-election spending announced by the chancellor will not begin to repair the damage. More hyperbole than hard cash, many announcements crumble under scrutiny – not 40 new hospitals but refurbishment for six. “A relatively gradual increase in spending,” said the Institute for Fiscal Studies. Welcome, yes, but Sajid Javid’s offer of “a decade of renewal” will be greeted with wry disbelief, too late to change public perceptions when voters see the threadbare services around them.Taking a breather from the fetid airlessness of this conference where all intellectual oxygen has been sucked out by “Get Brexit done”, I found Coffee4Craig, a small haven for the homeless, open two hours an evening for food, clothes and advice. Risha Lancaster opened it when her brother died on the streets from a heroin overdose. Among the old-timers, such as the woman in the wheelchair who comes for supper every night, she is alarmed to find so many more newcomers: she tries to ert them towards early help. “They get beaten up, everything stolen, especially shoes and ID. Everything spirals out of control.”The five-week wait for universal credit, along with benefits sanctions, tips many on to the street. “There’s nowhere to send them for mental health, so many addiction services shut down. There’s no beds.” Several have stumbled in to die here, turned out by hospitals. Here is the 54-year-old woman in a flowery blouse thrown out by her landlord, and a live-in chef sacked with no benefits for rent. “Not the council’s fault, after all the cuts to their funds. They do all they can.”The end of austerity will be a long time arriving here, if ever. Rough sleepers are only the most visible sign of the disintegration of all key services – from housing to A\u0026ampE waiting times, and benefit levels that no longer keep working families’ heads above poverty. None of this is anywhere on Johnson’s one nation horizon.He may think spaffing some last-minute cash has shot Labour’s fox. I doubt many voters will think austerity is over until there are no homeless in their supermarket doorways, until they can get a GP appointment, schools stop begging for pens, and the government takes the climate emergency seriously – virtually unmentioned here. Brexit stirs strong passions, but come an election the state of the nation counts for more – and the Tories will have no cover for their abysmal decade of strife and decay."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/58118c51853673ed6cf8f8e89c5b6b5df8718041/486_0_3514_2109/master/3514.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5531b09b21bfdd2317ab711f9efdff56","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of brave","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘brave’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘brave’.Share your photos of what brave means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 2 October at 10am.

But analysis by the School Cuts coalition shows the additional funding is not enough to repair the damage that has been done to our schools and colleges and that further investment is required. We are not being churlish, we are just stating the facts. The funding crisis is not over.”According to School Cuts, children in almost all local authorities in England will lose out and schools with the highest levels of deprivation will be worst affected despite the government’s funding injection.Education for the 16 to 19 age group, which has been particularly badly hit by austerity in recent years, will still face a shortfall of £1.1bn, despite the government’s promises on additional funding, School Cuts claims. Even with the additional £700m promised for children with special educational needs and disabilities, campaigners say that high needs block funding, which supports the most vulnerable children and young people, will still be £1.5bn short.Kevin Courtney, the NEU joint general secretary, said: “Johnson has made lots of empty promises on school funding – but his numbers don’t add up. The latest funding announcement falls well short of settling the shortfall for every child. And crucially it fails to reverse the cuts schools have suffered since 2015.”John Richards, the head of Unison’s education ision, said: “Schools are so cash starved that staff are buying equipment like pens and stationery with their own money. Valuable teaching assistants are also being axed by schools as they struggle to balance budgets. The government keeps promising resources but schools need money now.”“The government has committed to extra funding of £4.3bn per year in today’s prices, which will be enough to reverse cuts on average. However, that won’t fully come in until 2022. It’s therefore unsurprising to see analysis showing that most schools will have lower budgets in real-terms next year as compared with 2015.”The Department for Education said the government had announced the biggest funding boost for schools in a decade which would give every school more money for every child. “We are investing a total of £14bn more in schools over the next three years to 2022-23,” a spokesperson said.“This means all secondary schools will receive a minimum of at least £5,000 per pupil next year while all primary schools will get a minimum of at least £4,000 from 2021-22 – with the biggest increases going to the schools that need it most.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7fa8affe27ac98750d34d5b062076a5f38ba236/0_0_4182_2510/master/4182.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ea9c705ede080d509d912af130bf538c","title":"pine martens released secret location forest of dean gloucestershire","story":"Reintroduction of species into Gloucestershire could prove setback for grey squirrels The shy and elusive pine marten, a woodland creature almost hunted to extinction in the UK, has been reintroduced to a forest in the English west country.Eighteen of the animals have been released at a secret and remote location in the Forest of Dean in Gloucestershire.Conservationists hope the animals will breed, spread and eventually link up with a group of pine martens that was reintroduced across the border in Wales.It is possible the reintroduction will help manage the number of non-native grey squirrels in the forest and anywhere else the pine martens reach.Pine martens, which belong to the same family as otters and weasels, were once common in the UK. They are similar in size to a domestic cat with slim bodies, brown fur, a distinctive cream bib on their throats, long, bushy tails and prominent rounded ears.Extensive hunting, together with the loss of their woodland home, have led to them being pushed out to more remote parts of the UK. Their only remaining stronghold is in the Highlands of Scotland.There are believed to be about only 20 pine martens left in England. Between 2015 and 2017, more than 50 Scottish pine martens were captured and transported to Wales, where there is now an established population.In August and September this year, 18 pine martens were trapped near Inverness and taken to Gloucestershire. They were fitted with tracking collars and released into the Forest of Dean.Gareth Parry, the director of conservation at Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust, said the pine martens’ activity will be closely monitored. He predicted a setback for the local grey squirrels, who tend to produce fewer young when there is a potential predator in the area. A reduction in the number of grey squirrels could help preserve ancient woodland, which they damage.The pine martens are likely to co-exist happily with the wild boar, a Forest of Dean inhabitant, which has made a comeback in the area.Parry added: “We are in a bioersity emergency and conserving our remaining wildlife is not enough. We must also take action to support nature’s recovery.”Catherine McNicol, the trust’s conservation project manager, said people were unlikely to see pine martens soon. “Pine martens are elusive and shy animals, with their presence often only indicated by scats in the middle of forestry tracks,” she said. “They only give birth to a few kits each year if breeding is even successful, so the rate of marten population recovery in the UK is low.”Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust is working with several organisations on the project including Forestry England, the Vincent Wildlife Trust and Forest Research.Rebecca Wilson, Forestry England’s planning and environment manager in west England, said: “As native omnivores, pine martens play a vital role in the delicate balance of woodland ecosystems"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a81f493da4b8a2287234a9e3ed38372e09d99d80/0_192_1407_844/master/1407.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e6e754ddc2c614b6cc49831fba4f9eda","title":"statement sleeves and sharp tailoring the enduring style legacy of judy garland","story":"As Renée Zellweger gears up to play the Hollywood star in Judy, the film’s costume designer explains why Garland’s clothes are as memorable as her voice and one-linersPicture Judy Garland and what do you see? For many, it will be a rosy-cheeked 17-year-old in a blue-and-white gingham pinafore en route to the Emerald City. No surprise, then, that when the fabric of picnic hampers began its fashion renaissance circa spring 2016, appearing on catwalks, Instagram and the woman next to you on the bus as frequently as Dorothy longed for home, Garland’s character was often cited as style inspiration. The checked print is a byword for the wholesomeness associated with this young girl from Kansas – and fashion wanted a slice of it.Watching the new biopic Judy, in which Garland is played by Renée Zellweger, it’s clear her style didn’t start and end with that pinafore. Before Garland’s death, after an accidental overdose at the age of 47, she starred in more than 20 films and, according to the film’s costume designer, Jany Temime, Garland’s style is as enduring a part of her legacy as her voice, warmth, and one-liners.“She had a very specific style,” says Temime. “She was always playing. She was a comic a witty woman.” She thinks of the outfit she dressed Zellweger in for the scene of Garland’s wedding to Mickey Deans, her final, short-lived marriage. The short blue dress, with frills at the neck and a matching blue pillbox hat was a look that Temime interpreted for the film, “but the original is as stupid and silly as that. She styled it herself with that little hat. That’s so Judy Garland. She was trying to have fun with life.” And fashion fun rang out via her love of feathers and sequins.The film focuses the spotlight on her later life, specifically the year before her death in 1969. Tweaked out after decades of drug addiction and alcoholism, broke and haunted by past trauma, she is forced to go to London for five weeks of performances at the Talk of the Town cabaret club in a bid to earn enough money to help her reunite with her two younger children.The costumes were all inspired by things Garland wore, but nothing is an exact copy “because we had very heavy copyright” says Temime, “but also because I didn’t want to copy. The film is about Judy Garland, but it’s not a documentary about Judy Garland it’s a drama.”Red scarves worn by Garland were reinterpreted as a giant red bow tie on Zellweger’s character – a nod, says Temime, to the well-known tune Be a Clown. A red, pleated frock Temime saw Garland wearing in an interview became a red dress worn during an ill-fated TV appearance, followed by an ill-fated performance at the club.“It was understanding her and thinking she would have worn red at that moment – I was having a sort of sixth sense telling me this.”“It was much better to work in opposition on that film,” says Temime of the clothes. For example, at the start of the film, when Garland finds herself essentially homeless, Temime dressed her in a bright orange jacquard suit and green silk blouse. “She’s trying to find a hotel to spend the night, and she’s dressed up for the stage. This is her life at that moment. She is a star without a roof, but she had to look like a star.”In a later scene, before a high-stakes opening night performance and shut away in her hotel bathroom, Garland makes for a crumbling figure, but her clothes would have you believe otherwise. Her dress, says Temime, is “a very big contrast with her state of mind at that moment … She feels like a piece of shit, she feels terrible, she’s drinking, she cannot sleep, she’s full of drugs.” But the outfit speaks of Hollywood glamour meeting the London stage. Later, when she is buoyed up by a successful first night in London, Temime dresses her in pastels: “She starts feeling better, so I thought I don’t need, any more, the aggression of the colour.”Garland’s style has echoes in the modern day beyond picnic-hamper chic. Look to the statement sleeves that her character, Esther, wore in Meet Me in St Louis – now ubiquitous, from high-end brands such as Balmain to high-street shops such as Zara. Or the waistcoat and tailored jacket she wore in A Star Is Born, which wouldn’t look out of place at the most recent Marc Jacobs, Gucci or Burberry shows.Then, of course, there’s the prairie dress, which has made the last few seasons feel like O Pioneers! – or a journey down the Yellow Brick Road. Garland’s off-duty “mum wardrobe” in the film, which Temime made distinct from her more glamorous variety looks, chimes with the kind of easy style Miuccia Prada likes to champion. There are abstract printed shirts and camel-coloured cigarette trousers. “She was a woman from the States, and in the States they were wearing slacks,” Temime says.The modern feeling of some of the costumes helps to hammer home the present-day echoes of Garland’s story. It was during her adolescence, which played out on sets, that she first became addicted to the drugs that would cause her death – MGM, to which she signed at 13, would give her amphetamines to keep her awake for long working days, and barbiturates to sleep on command. The film flashes back to these years of weight-shaming and abuse. It is no secret that child stars are also often beset by difficulties well into adulthood. “It could have happened today,” says Temime. “We have lots of examples.”Despite using lots of vintage clothes, she didn’t want it to feel like she was creating a historical figure, hoping instead to make her feel dynamic and alive. “I didn’t want to put Judy Garland in a pocket of 1968,” she says. “At a certain point you forget that it was once upon a time, it could be now,” she says. “I wanted to make it feel like she is completely eternal. She could still be alive. She’s not dead, she’s still there and everything she was wearing we could wear now.”• Judy is released in the UK on 2 October."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c0036be9aabfaa74bf3942a71adad323c3fb47b3/0_101_2789_1674/master/2789.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aaedf9b994c41be69b69d0bb20fac5bb","title":"hollywood film industry ageism judy garland renee zellweger","story":"Renée Zellweger’s Garland biopic is a powerful reminder of the attitudes that infect youth-obsessed HollywoodIn 1962, Judy Garland received an Oscar nomination for her role in Judgment at Nuremberg and regarded it as an auspicious restart for her career. She had been thrown into the deep end of Hollywood’s unforgiving waters as a child actor, and since her early success, every aspect of her life had been marred by desperate attempts to keep her head above water. Unsuccessful marriages to other struggling artists, an addiction to drugs that was spurred on by abusive producers and, above all, her constant anxiety to control her appearance – all these problems were symptoms of her toxic relationship with Hollywood. “Isn’t this pretty good for somebody Hollywood thought as too old, too fat and too undependable to offer a job?” she wrote. Judy, the new film starring Renée Zellweger, recounts the sad ending that she was heading for instead.Judy joins the list of Hollywood biopics that carry an air of atonement, in which the misfortunes of earlier generations of stars who were cast away from the industry – largely due to their age – are memorialised and sentimentalised. Films such as The Artist and Film Stars Don’t Die in Liverpool have an admirable goal: celebrating the lives of performers who were callously underappreciated toward the end of their careers. But it is becoming more and more difficult to take away a positive message when Hollywood itself draws attention to how much Hollywood hasn’t changed.The star of Judy is herself re-emerging from a hiatus: one that was caused by the same maladies afflicting old Hollywood that the movie depicts. Zellweger retreated from acting after she entered Hollywood’s dead zone for women aged 40 or over. She borrows from a familiar sense of disenchantment with the profession when she tries to give life to Garland’s emotional state at the end of her life. In interviews for the movie, Zellweger says she is ready for the roles that will embody her maturity. Whether the studios have the same plans remains to be seen.Some big-screen veterans still attract an enthusiastic audience. The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, starring Judi Dench, Maggie Smith, and Bill Nighy, which explored the lives of retired Brits living in an Indian hotel, exceeded expectations by grossing more than $130m worldwide. Book Club put the same trust in the box-office power of older American actors, including Jane Fonda, Diane Keaton and Candice Bergen. Both movies secured sequels and softened the industry’s attitude towards taking risks with older actors.But for every hard-earned movie project that serves the age demographic well by telling a complicated story about old age, Hollywood churns out two Schwarzenegger movies with tag lines like, “Retirement is for sissies”. There are obviously Hollywood pitch meetings reserved for the older male action stars of the 80s. Twelve of the 15 highest-grossing movies of that decade have been remade, and most of them are produced to mask the age of their stars. Rambo 5, Terminator 6, Die Hard 5, Indiana Jones 5 and now the second Top Gun, all ride the new American myth of super-agers.To pull this off, Hollywood encourages bizarre anti-ageing clinics even as it abandons the female stars of the 80s, pairing their former male co-stars with much younger on-screen love interests. And now the industry has added a new weapon to its digital arsenal: de-ageing technology. Advocates believe that VFX technology could help ameliorate the representation problem. But it’s more likely that de-ageing technology help Hollywood avoid the problem of finding roles for older stars by erasing signs of age as opposed to embracing them.In the past, small- to mid-budget projects have been the most welcoming to older stars. Many darlings of the screen who hit their peak in the 1940s, 50s and the 60s bid their adieu delivering memorable performances in this subgenre. Among them were Katharine Hepburn and Henry Fonda playing ageing parents in On Golden Pond, John Wayne as an out-of-time gunslinger in The Shootist, and Julie Christie as a woman struggling with memory loss in Away from Her. More recent examples – Robert Redford in The Old Man and the Gun and Clint Eastwood in The Mule – underwhelmed artistically and commercially. Perhaps Marlon Brando was the most accurate predictor of the future. Toward the end of his career, he had come to terms with Hollywood’s commodification of youth and vitality. He sought the help of early adopters of VFX technology to create an animated 3D version of his face, believing that the studios would, after his death, want to keep a young Brando alive on the screen. “Maybe this is the swan song for all of us,” he said, even though it’s not real and “inside a computer”. Today, Hollywood’s fascination with de-ageing technology seems to affirm Brando’s bleak premonition, as it continues to insist older actors surrender to its obsession with youth."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2024754de2bb0fa78965d746bdd78495fdf7181e/0_16_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6e6ee65ac64360730fc44bf8212f10d6","title":"manchester city to face atletico madrid in last 16 of womens champions league","story":"Manchester City were handed a tricky tie in the Champions League last-16 draw, with Nick Cushing’s side set to face the Spanish champions, Atlético Madrid, as Arsenal were paired with Slavia Prague.City cruised past the Swiss side Lugano 11-1 to reach the second knockout round but they will be out to make amends after the team whimpered out of the competition to Atlético in the round of 32 last season.

It is still not where they want to be – but Arsenal did enough, ultimately, to warrant a point from a thud-and-blunder evening that demonstrated how far these old rivals have to go before they can harbour realistic title ambitions. On this evidence it is going to be a long way back. Scott McTominay did score a peach of a goal for United but, last season included, the difficult truth for Ole Gunnar Solskjær is that his team have not managed more than one goal in 11 of their last 12 league fixtures.Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang supplied Arsenal’s equaliser after VAR had overturned a rotten offside decision and, points-wise, it is the first time since the 1989-90 season that United have not reached double figures from their first seven games. That is the same season, it may be recalled, that Old Trafford chanted for Bryan Robson to take over and a banner appeared in the stands calling for Alex Ferguson, then just a plain old Mister, to be removed from office.This time the crowd is nothing like as grumpy. The weather is still the same, of course, although it would probably be a bit too generous on the two sets of players to blame the near-unremitting Mancunian downpour for their inability to pass the ball more stylishly. It was an accident-prone evening, littered with clumsiness, and it told a clear story about why these sides are already playing catch-up to Liverpool and Manchester City in the top two positions. Nobody should realistically expect them to win that chase.Not that the lack of real quality – and it was startling at times – stopped the game from burning slowly into an entertaining contest. The first half, in truth, was a bit of a stinker. Or at least it was until McTominay grew weary of the torpor and, 20 yards out, smacked in a firecracker of a shot. After that, however, there was lots of drama and incident at either end, not least the equalising goal when Aubameyang was initially judged to be offside in the moments before he flicked the ball over David de Gea.It turned out to be a particularly poor judgment from a trigger-happy linesman and possibly the easiest VAR decision yet. Harry Maguire had been playing Aubameyang onside by some distance. United did have a reasonable argument De Gea would have made more of an effort to block the shot had he not seen the raised flag.It was a lesson, perhaps, for De Gea and all the goalkeepers in this league that the officials cannot always be trusted now the rules have changed.For Solskjær the disappointment was compounded by the fact the equaliser came from Axel Tuanzebe, playing at left-back for United on a night when they were missing both first-choice full-backs, making a wretched pass inside his own half to lose possession and give Bukayo Saka the opportunity to feed Aubameyang.It was that kind of night and, in the worst moments, it was remarkable to think these were supposedly elite teams.For Arsenal it must have been a cause for anguish that McTominay’s goal could be traced back to one of their own corners. Arsenal looked vulnerable as soon as their opponents started streaming out of their own penalty area. In a rare moment of nostalgia, United had managed to turn defence into attack in a few seconds. Daniel James could not produce a telling cross but Marcus Rashford chased the ball towards the corner flag and then cut it back for McTominay to let fly. He struck the ball beautifully and the shot was still rising as it hit the net.McTominay, though, must also feel he could have won the match, at 1-1, when he had a golden opportunity to score from a header.Until his goal the first half had been a grind. Nicolas Pépé put Arsenal’s first real chance into the Stretford End when he had more time than he probably realised. Andreas Pereira tried to liven up proceedings with a shot that Bernd Leno saved down to his left.The away end chanted for VAR after a cross thudded into McTominay’s chest. The rain fell hard on a humdrum game. And at that stage United’s best hope appeared to be high ball into the penalty area and someone getting on the end of one of Maguire’s knockdowns. It was poor in the extreme and, unfortunately for Granit Xhaka, his first game since being named as Arsenal’s full-time captain contained an element of tragicomedy.For Example A, consider his ability, at 0-0, to make a pig’s ear from a free-kick in a promising position. More damagingly for Arsenal, however, Xhaka was also culpable of ducking out of the way of McTominay’s shot. The only possible mitigation was the ball took a tiny nick off another Arsenal player. Xhaka’s head was down, his eyes fixed on the floor, and the ball was spearing into the roof of the net.It was the kind of moment that might wake Tony Adams, Martin Keown et al during the early hours in a cold sweat. And fitting, perhaps, for a night that left one pining for the days when this game was the biggest occasion in England’s top ision."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3bac4add8c6fe4b3f8198b9c4616d46443532ead/0_303_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=52d75d8be4e8c2ea0cbad39fe6310981","title":"cinema and the art of interior design","story":"Directors such as Pedro Almodovar understand the psychological power of living spacesTwo almost-autobiographical films came out in late summer, one set in a Knightsbridge flat decorated in shades of porridge, and the other in an apartment in Madrid filled with brilliantly coloured design icons and flamboyant figurative artworks. The first demonstrated few aesthetic choices beyond a wall of mirror tiles the second maybe too many. Still, you can probably guess which one I preferred.This mismatching movie pair is The Souvenir by Joanna Hogg and Pedro Almodóvar’s Pain and Glory. The first details the early film-making years of its director, and a relationship with a manipulative heroin addict. The second, set in the unable-to-make-films years of Almodóvar’s life, loops together multiple strands of his existence, including a replacement of prescription painkillers with street heroin that may or may not be true. (Who cares? It’s such an acute comment on pain relief in these Sackler times).Hogg’s unformed Knightsbridge interior is the perfect, dull backdrop for her own inchoate, twentysomething state, a physical version of a life utterly free from conspicuous displays of just about anything. A visit to her parents’ country home – a rather fine slab of Georgian – reveals an equally undemonstrative existence played out across more acres of cream fitted carpeting.The highly constructed condition of Almodóvar’s world, on the other hand – the Fornasetti cabinet with butterflies fluttering across its doors the Enzo Mari Pear poster the shiny red Magistretti lamp – is a drama in itself. Its exquisite scenography suggests there is little or no ide between the director’s personal and professional worlds. In fact, some of the pieces of furniture and objets reoccur. In 2009’s Broken Romance the camera lingers on a red Enzo Mari Apple print, when Penelope Cruz, as the bored lover of a film producer, gets sent off to redecorate his already lavishly decorated mansion. We travel through magnificent rooms, filled with Saarinen tables and Bertoia wire chairs, as well as lush paintings. I don’t doubt that some are by Guillermo Pérez Villalta. Everywhere red leaps from the screen, in a film ostensibly about a man who has lost his sight, who now lives in a world where objects are defined by their feel, not their look.Interior design in films is an integral part of the narrative when it’s good, it creates an additional psychological layer. Indications of taste and status are all very well, but it can do so much more. I mean, who wouldn’t expect Patrick Bateman’s apartment to resemble anything other than an office lobby-cum-operating theatre as it does in the adaptation of American Psycho? Every element of the film struggled to convey the novel’s relentless sociopathy and superficial materialism without it appearing listlessly list-like, and perhaps not everyone quite got the serial killer message. This year GQ Middle East ran a “get the look” feature on this very interior, with a slender proviso of “without the creepiness” and a full guide on where to get the Barcelona chairs and B+B Italia Alanda coffee table. (They should check in with MotherFatherSon next – the TV serial drama starring Richard Gere – where the media mogul’s son lives in chilly minimal splendour at the top of the Leadenhall building. Though surely even they know that no good comes to those who live with stainless steel floors.)Recently I’ve been watching FosseVerdon, about the entwined lives of the choreographer-director and performer-choreographer in 1960s and 1970s New York. Their shared apartment, a penthouse in Manhattan at 91 Central Park West, with a terrace large enough for a vegetable garden and a dog run, was slavishly recreated by the designer Alex DiGerlando from old photographs. This was a world of Tiffany lamps and thick-pile upholstery, ashtrays on stands and dark greens and aubergines: like their lives, seductive more than healthy. The kitchen, a small room for such a huge property, had a chequer-board tiled floor. “I’d never have thought of putting crushed orange velvet on the walls,” he said in an interview.No imagery existed of the Southampton beach house that Fosse took on in the summer of 1973 – a statement of change and an outward show of success, along with a much younger lover, following his spell in a psychiatric hospital. The team designed it from imagination – its concertina’d glazed facade suggesting a thoroughly contemporary footloose life that even New York couldn’t provide. Friends of Fosse have since said this fictional space is just as they remembered it, perhaps unsurprising as they were rarely one step from another sip of wine. And if you want to get this look, those Marcel Breuer Cesca chairs around the dining table are very much for real."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/704714cd49500fb607f34f8116659064408da32a/317_133_3681_2209/master/3681.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fe0fa67de279d55c13869e4722e5e1e3","title":"naga munchetty bbc reverses decision to censure presenter","story":"Director general Tony Hall emails staff to say he is overturning ruling over impartiality guidelinesThe BBC has reversed its decision to sanction BBC Breakfast presenter Naga Munchetty for breaking impartiality guidelines with her comments about Donald Trump, following a staff uprising against the ruling and enormous political pressure.Tony Hall, the BBC director general, emailed all staff on Monday to say he had reviewed the decision following internal and external protests. He said that, on reflection, the BBC’s complaints unit had made the wrong call when they ruled against Munchetty, one of the BBC’s most prominent minority ethnic journalists, for expressing a personal response to the US president’s statement in July that four American congresswomen of colour should “go home”.Asked about Trump’s comments on BBC Breakfast, Munchetty said: “Every time I have been told, as a woman of colour, to go back to where I came from, that was embedded in racism.”The U-turn over censuring her came after the  obtained leaked internal correspondence casting doubts on public claims about the complaints process made by a senior BBC executive, as he attempted to explain why Munchetty’s co-host Dan Walker had escaped punishment, despite taking part in the same discussion.The BBC’s editorial standards director, David Jordan, said Walker could not have been investigated because the single viewer complaint which led to the ruling did not mention the male presenter. “The simple fact is we haven’t had a complaint about Dan Walker’s role,” he said in one interview. “The complaint was about Naga Munchetty.”However, copies of the viewer’s complaint leaked to the  show that the original correspondence was explicitly about both Munchetty and Walker, leading to internal anger from BBC employees who demanded that women and minority ethnic journalists should be treated fairly by the corporation.The original complaint from a member of the public was titled “Blatant political bias from both presenters” and described Walker as “very unprofessional”, with the member of the public making clear that they blamed the male presenter for leading Munchetty into making the comments.The original complaint said: “Dan Walker, whilst interviewing a guest about President Trump’s recent tweets regarding 4 Democrat politicians in the USA, repeatedly expressed incredulity that anybody could defend Trump’s tweets. Very unprofessionally, he then asked his fellow presenter Naga Munchetty for her personal opinions on this news story! She foolishly complied with his request and launched into an attack on Trump, including stating that she was personally ‘furious’ about his comments. “These two presenters have never made any secret of their left-wing and anti-Trump bias but usually in more subtle ways, such as eye-rolling and looks of exasperation when reporting on news stories. However, personal commentary on controversial news stories is surely going too far and is way outside of their remit. They are employed as presenters not political commentators and as such should at least feign impartiality. It’s about time they were reminded of this.”The BBC insisted Jordan had not lied in the interviews when he said that Walker was not mentioned. They said Jordan was only referring to a revised version of the complaint, submitted by the same member of the public, which had been elevated to the corporation’s executive complaints unit. The BBC said this final version of the viewer complaint was solely about Munchetty, meaning it could not investigate Walker for his role in the discussion.On Monday night, BBC employees said the issue had reignited wider concerns about on-screen ersity at the corporation and how the BBC treated prominent senior white, male journalists differently to staff from a minority ethnic background.“People don’t care if it’s a conspiracy or not it just exposes the hypocrisy at the BBC,” said one senior journalist. “It’s come out by chance but it’s symptomatic of the arrogance of how BBC management treats women and people of colour. What’s really important is that Naga has said nothing and done nothing to encourage this, people have reacted spontaneously. This has got so big because journalists have just got together on their own and complained.”BBC journalists described growing concerns about the broadcaster’s role in an ongoing culture war which uses the BBC’s news coverage as a battleground for settling political scores, with particular concerns about a sometimes opaque complaints process that can be influenced by a single persistent member of the public.The U-turn followed several days in which the BBC management staunchly defended the original decision, insisting that although Munchetty was allowed to call Trump’s comments racist and offer a verdict on how they made her feel as a woman of colour, she could not cast aspersions on his character.The BBC had originally attempted to defend the decision, with Jordan saying it was not its role to be “calling out people for being liars or racist”.However, the corporation had come under intense political pressure to change direction, with the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, calling for it to be reconsidered and Labour MP Seema Malhotra organising a letter to Hall, signed by 100 MPs, calling for a meeting to discuss the decision.Hall’s email to BBC staff explained why he had changed direction: “I have looked carefully at all the arguments that have been made and assessed all of the materials. I have also examined the complaint itself,” he said. “It was only ever in a limited way that there was found to be a breach of our guidelines. These are often finely balanced and difficult judgments.“But, in this instance, I don’t think Naga’s words were sufficient to merit a partial uphold of the complaint around the comments she made. There was never any sanction against Naga and I hope this step makes that absolutely clear. She is an exceptional journalist and presenter and I am proud that she works for the BBC.“I have asked the editorial and leadership teams to discuss how we manage live exchanges on air around these topics in the future. Our impartiality is fundamental to our journalism and is what our audiences expect of us.”However, Hall fell short of apologising to Munchetty and did not address the issue of Jordan’s comments or why Walker had not be investigated for taking part in the discussion. On Friday, the BBC’s entire team of executives – including Hall - signed a public letter which backed the original decision, a position that has now been abandoned.The decision also raises major questions about the BBC’s ability to enforce its impartiality guidelines in the future, given the director general has now shown himself willing to intervene and overturn ruling by the semi-independent complaints unit in face of public pressure. The corporation’s management has been struggling to stop its journalists speaking out in a personal capacity on issues such as the Munchetty ruling and LGBT rights, with staff increasingly willing to ignore warnings from bosses to stay quiet."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4186dbc8660bce2bf97e866da608918869ab65e2/190_110_2653_1591/master/2653.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a672fd4dd58e632ffd8ca1860cb4f4ca","title":"peter frampton how we made baby i love your way chris kimsey","story":"‘There were 8,000 people going nuts for us in San Francisco. The band were on fire. And we ended up with the best-selling live album of all time’When I was 11, I saw this guy on the steps of our school playing sax and singing Elvis Presley songs. I asked my father – the school’s art teacher – who he was. He said: “Oh, that’s Jones.” I said: “I want to be him.” We became great friends, and “Jones” became better known as David Bowie. David used to tell a story about seeing me on Top of the Pops with the Herd and going: “That’s Peter! Why isn’t he in school?”I also played guitar in Humble Pie with Steve Marriott from the Small Faces, but wanted to lead my own band and do some singing. After my first three solo albums flopped, I was convinced the record company were about to drop me.I had three weeks off, so took my guitar to Nassau in the Bahamas to write another album, knowing it was probably make or break. I bumped into Alvin Lee from Ten Years After at the airport and thought: “I won’t get any work done now.” I don’t remember anything about the next two weeks, but after Alvin left I thought: “I’ve got a week left to write the album.”The next day I messed around with my acoustic and in about 20 minutes came up with the chords that became Show Me the Way. I had some lunch and a little swim and under a palm tree I then wrote Baby I Love Your Way. Both songs are about the girlfriend I was about to start living with. With Baby I Love Your Way, the sun was setting, so I wrote: “The shadows grow so long before my eyes.” The moonlight brought the fireflies out, so they went into the song, too.We recorded the studio version of Baby I Love Your Way in a castle in Gloucestershire, using Ronnie Lane’s mobile studio. The idea was to get away from London and the label, not that they interfered much. It was more a manor with a few turrets than a full-on medieval castle, so not too goth, but dank and miserable. There were balls and chains and armour.Quite often when anyone’s under pressure in music, you find that something special happens very quickly. Peter was listening to a lot of Stevie Wonder and was impressed that Stevie played every instrument on his records, so Peter did that, too – everything except the drums, and he’s a really good drummer!The live version is more stripped down, faster, with more electric guitar. Peter sings his heart out. He wasn’t really noted as a singer so he wanted to make his mark, and he succeeded. The energy of the live album feels as if there’s sunshine on it – Big Mountain kept that feel for their reggae cover version – whereas on our initial album version it was probably pissing it down with rain.People always ask me whether the live album was overdubbed. It was all live apart from a keyboard part we had to fix because a lead came out on stage. Frampton Comes Alive! was never intended to be a double album. Peter’s manager went: “Nobody will want to listen to the whole gig.” But, when A\u0026ampM Records owner Jerry Moss came down to listen, he said: “Where’s the rest of it?” So we had to go back in and mix the rest. After the live album came out, Peter couldn’t go out on his own because he’d get mobbed. In New York, girls would be jumping on him – not just a few but loads of them – trying to rip his clothes off. It was insane.• Peter Frampton’s new album, All Blues, is out now. His farewell tour of the US ends on 12 October."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/64dd571c3f328731f92c7ab96a6bd50aa80177f6/0_0_2316_1390/master/2316.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a974970140b8c194c5d8aff7cd26563c","title":"is it over for justin trudeau podcast","story":"The Canadian prime minister achieved a historic victory in 2015 but as he nears the end of his first term a series of scandals are making his political future less certain.

That is an absolute commitment.”A government source said the report was a misrepresentation of the “non-paper”, which discussed customs checks at place of origin or destination of goods.In the limited cases that inspections were needed, physical checks could be at dedicated premises, factories or production sites, the source suggested.But Simon Coveney, Ireland’s deputy prime minister, dismissed the proposals as a “non-starter”, and called for a “serious proposal” from the UK.Sinn Féin in Ireland and the Social Democratic and Labour party in Northern Ireland also dismissed the plans on Monday night. Sinn Féin president Mary Lou McDonald said they were “absolutely out of the question”, while SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said: “It doesn’t matter if it’s a mile, five miles or 10 miles away, the presence of physical checks will create economic and security challenges that are unacceptable.”Labour said the proposals were “utterly unworkable”. Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, said: “They would place an enormous administrative burden on businesses and rely on technology that does not yet exist.“Crucially, if true, they represent a rowing back on the commitments made to the people of Northern Ireland two years ago that there would be no return to a hard border or related checks or controls.”The leak comes as Johnson puts his finishing touches on formal written proposals expected to go to Brussels in the next week for a revised Brexit deal.Although all the indications are that a large gap remains in thinking, signs have emerged that the hardline position of the Conservative party’s most Eurosceptic backbenchers has softened just days before Boris Johnson’s team are due to enter a “tunnel” of secret negotiations with Brussels.Mark Francois, the deputy chair of the European Research Group, has opened the door to a potential Brexit deal, indicating he would look at one even if it included a version of the controversial Irish border backstop to which the Eurosceptic ERG was once implacably opposed.During a heated and sometimes bad-tempered event on the party conference fringe, he indicated that the “Spartan” wing of the party was in the mood for a deal.“It has been sometimes been said that we will vote against anything regardless. That’s not true,” he said referring to the bloc of 28 backbenchers who voted against Theresa May’s Brexit deal three times.“If there is some form of deal, be it over the backstop or anything else, then I and my colleagues will look at it and read it very carefully, because at the end of the day you are talking about international treaty law. So I’ll look at a deal if there is one,” he said.Francois’ comments were seen as a subtle shift in approach for the ERG, whose support could unlock a deal for Johnson.The British government’s version of Brexit involves the UK ultimately leaving the single market and customs union, requiring the return of a range of checks on goods crossing the border between\u0026nbspNorthern Ireland\u0026nbspand the Republic of Ireland. The “backstop” is intended as a standstill placeholder to ensure such checks do not have to be imposed between Brexit happening with a deal, and the start of a new free trade agreement yet to be negotiated between the UK and the EU.Theresa May\u0027s withdrawal agreement proposed keeping the whole of the UK in a shared customs territory with the EU during this period. An alternative idea involves only Northern Ireland staying in the EU’s customs territory. That would place a customs border in the Irish Sea. May described it as a threat to the constitutional integrity of the UK, but the new prime minister, Boris Johnson, has opened the current talks by proposing an all-Ireland agri-food zone. The suggestion is that he will seek to quietly build on that with further NI-only arrangements.Given an NI-only backstop was an EU proposal in the first place, the U-turn would be warmly welcomed in Brussels, although attempts to give the Northern Ireland assembly a veto on its continuation would not be acceptable, and the DUP would be unlikely to support the prime minister in such a move in parliament.If there is a no-deal Brexit, then there is no backstop.As recently as August, the de facto whip of the ERG warned that Johnson must honour his promise to kill off Theresa May’s deal completely.Johnson has publicly said May’s withdrawal agreement is dead but the formal proposals, due to go to the EU next week, are expected to revolve around a revised backstop for Northern Ireland involving an agreement for agri-food on the island of Ireland and a possible time limit on the other elements of the backstop.“My acid test will be: does it mean we genuinely leave the EU?” Francois told a meeting organised by the Eurosceptic thinktank Bruges Group.He said his support for a deal “rather depends what’s in it … As a so-called Spartan, if it means we genuinely leave the EU, if it means we genuinely leave on Halloween, I will be the first in the aye lobby. If it really means we don’t, then I will vote against it and if we don’t no amount of browbeating will make me change my mind.”His remarks follow weeks of shifting mood over the Irish backstop. The Democratic Unionist party, which was implacably opposed to the backstop, has also indicated it was in the mood for a deal. It is understood that the DUP has been consulted on the plans that Johnson is to take to Brussels next week.Ireland’s prime minister, Leo Varadkar, also hinted last week that there could be amendments to the withdrawal agreement but warned there was still a huge gap between the UK and Irish positions.The DUP leader, Arlene Foster, said she would look at the possibility of a backstop with a time limit but warned that agreeing to consider one was not the same as “advocating” one.She told the Bruges Group: “It would be good to get rid of the iniquitous backstop” but added that it would be “good to get a deal”.She called for space to be given to negotiators, who now have fewer than 17 days to come up with a deal before the next EU summit."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7760fe4028c98eefe78d85ee968ac9d9a044b4cb/13_0_3484_2091/master/3484.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4efa78264223268fac8c4ed296ba54e4","title":"theresa may i would rather write alpine whodunnit than memoir","story":"Ex-PM says she would like to write novel based on ill-fated 19th century ascent of MatterhornHe was the British mountaineer who led the first ascent of one of the most formidable mountains in the Alps. She was the prime minister who is likely to go down in history for ultimately failing to reach the summit of her own personal Matterhorn.Yet in her first public interview since leaving Downing Street – at a book festival in where she was asked about what book she might now find the time to write – Theresa May revealed that it was the dark rumours surrounding how four of Edward Whymper’s climbing party fell to their doom that most appealed to her.“A number of people sadly died on the way down and there is a question as to the rope that was used. Why it broke is an interesting question,” said May, to laughter from an audience at the Henley literary festival for a talk about her career and the books that had inspired her.Anyone seeking a parallel to her own ill-fated attempt to drag the Conservative party towards a difficult Brexit deal may be struck by the ’s 1865 account of the accident, in which it is reported that after the leader of the expedition decided to press on to the summit against the expectation of others in the group, one of the party slipped and dragged three others to their demise.Speaking as the Conservative party conference took place in Manchester, May did not point out any similarities, but suggested that her interest writing a real-life 19th century whodunnit set in the Alps was a combination of her love of detective novels and walking near the Matterhorn with her husband.“I suppose because we like walking in the Alps I might like to write something about that,” said May, after vigorously shaking her head when asked if she was planning to write a memoir, or had kept diaries while in Number 10.Interviewed for an hour by Olympic gold medal-winning rower Dame Katherine Grainger, nothing had changed when it came to May’s famous reticence. Her stack of cookbooks now numbered 150 but she couldn’t name a favourite. She also hadn’t read David Cameron’s recently published memoirs. Instead, detective fiction in the form of an Inspector Montalbano novel was currently beside her bedside.One of the more striking revelations about a book that had shaped her centred on Rachel Carson’s Silent Spring, the 1962 text that is sometimes credited with laying the foundations of the modern environmental movement.May had not read it but said that it had shaped her mother’s thinking. May said: “I know that my mother was very taken by it and it impacted on her, and that sort of fed through to me. In a sense it was quite unusual for vicar’s wife in north Oxfordshire to read a controversial book like that but I am very glad that she did.”Rather than awakening May up to a radical green agenda, however, Silent Spring seemingly had a more abstract effect of making her “cognisant of the environment in which you are operating” while also showing the impact a book could have.Adding that she didn’t believe her mother would have been “demonstrating on the streets”, May expressed regret that not enough attention had been paid to the issues raised by Carson.“I always say now that on climate change, my husband and I enjoy walking in Switzerland in the Alps and there is one particular place where over the years we have been going there we have been seeing the glacier retreating year by year and you just think: something is happening, something is changing here and we need to think about how we manage it.”Meanwhile, one of the few moments when May was questioned about contemporary controversies came when she was asked if she was surprised by the reaction to her honours list, which bestowed a knighthood on Geoffrey Boycott, the the former England cricket captain.The honour sparked controversy owing to his conviction in a French court more than 20 years ago for assaulting his then girlfriend.“Well I put my honours list together believing that there were people who I believed should be honoured in that way,” said May, shifting uncomfortably in her seat.“There was reaction in a variety of ways to my resignation honours. You just put together the names that you thought were appropriate.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ad259e6a196200ba53b5cae89c9938cbfcad1a8c/0_99_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f8b8a9dcda95ede189e757d1b26d9ba0","title":"westminster parties sign pledge to use moderate language","story":"Statement signed by main parties follows furious scenes in recent debatesSenior figures from the main Westminster parties have signed a pledge outlining their “responsibility to try to use moderate language” following furious scenes in the Commons in recent debates about Brexit.The statement, drawn up during a meeting at the Speaker’s House in parliament on Monday, was signed by Mark Spencer, the government chief whip – most government ministers are in Manchester for the Conservative conference – and Jeremy Corbyn.The other signatories were the Scottish National party’s Westminster leader, Ian Blackford the Liberal Democrat leader, Jo Swinson the Democratic Unionist party’s Nigel Dodds the Green MP Caroline Lucas the Independent Group for Change leader, Anna Soubry Plaid Cymru’s Liz Saville Roberts and the Speaker, John Bercow.“We all accept that we have a responsibility to try to use moderate language,” the statement begin. “We all feel that those in leadership positions have a particular duty to weigh their words carefully, bearing in mind that there are stark isions across the country on Brexit.“The right of a member to personal safety is absolute and unconditional. Everyone is entitled to have a view – be they parliamentarian, journalist or a member of the public – and their right to safety cannot in any way be dependent on what that view is or the course of political action they take.”The gathering was instigated following anger and upset in the Commons last week, when there was repeated criticism of Boris Johnson for terms such as “surrender bill” to describe a backbench-instigated law seeking to prevent a no-deal Brexit.The most vehement anger came on Wednesday last week, when Johnson described as “humbug” worries expressed by Labour’s Paula Sherriff about threats to MPs by people using the same language as the prime minister, and her fears of a repeat of the 2016 murder of fellow Labour MP Jo Cox by a far-right terrorist.Johnson was also condemned for arguing in the same debate that the best way to honour Cox – who campaigned vigorously for remain – would be to “get Brexit done”.The prime minister repeatedly refused to apologise, saying only that his use of “humbug” referred to people arguing against the use of the term surrender, and that he was “sorry for the misunderstanding”.Speaking after the meeting, Corbyn said he had requested the gathering following Johnson’s comments “and the appalling language he used, particularly in respect of Paula Sheriff’s comments over the death of Jo Cox”.Corbyn said: “The Speaker has since drafted up a statement on behalf of us, which is to say: tone down the rhetoric, tone down the language.“‘Yes, political debate. Yes, political disagreement. Yes, passionate political thought but don’t use hyperbolic language that’s dangerous. Don’t use language that incites people to act in a dangerous way on the streets of our country."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b858235a242932e60c4f97a9d0e9f0f4dbc89d35/550_1136_4693_2816/master/4693.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5dd37fda1ac9629420d15a993b876c1c","title":"can labour unite and plot a path to power","story":"Sonia Sodha joins Anushka Asthana to discuss Labour’s options now that parliament has resumed and the party has backed Jeremy Corbyn’s Brexit strategy.

The scientists behind the study have previously proposed it might have its evolutionary roots in a reflex linked to the release of eggs during sex – a mechanism that exists today in several animal species, including rabbits.Since humans have spontaneous ovulation, the theory goes that female orgasm may be an evolutionary hangover. They say the new experiment supports the idea.To explore the question the team gave 12 female rabbits a two-week course of fluoxetine (trade name Prozac) – an antidepressant known to reduce the capacity for women to orgasm – and looked at the number of eggs released after the animals had sex with a male rabbit called Frank.Further experiments backed the theory that the drug was affecting ovulation through a mechanism involved in copulation and entailing the nervous system, rather than acting directly on the ovaries or other routes.The team said the results fit their theory that rabbits needed to experience something akin to an orgasm to have a hormonal surge and ovulate, although it is not known if it gives the animals sexual pleasure.They also said their theory was supported by a previous finding that animals that rely on sex-induced hormonal surges for ovulation tended to have a clitoris – the organ behind the female orgasm – in a position that meant it was more likely to be stimulated during sex.Pavličev said it remained unclear exactly how Prozac affected the reflex in rabbits, and that further experiments with other animals was necessary.She added that even if the theory was right, an important question was why is the organism still there – could it be that it had acquired a different function, that there was a function on female health?Elisabeth Lloyd, a professor of biology at Indiana University and author of The Case of the Female Orgasm, praised the study and said it offered support for the team’s theory.She said questions remained, including whether the same muscles and nerve fibres involved in the reflex in rabbits were present in the female orgasm. She also noted that ovulation and orgasm were linked to different hormones in humans, though it was unclear why – if female orgasm had its roots in ovulation – orgasms in men and women showed so many overlapping features.Such features, she said, had generally been thought to support the theory that orgasm evolved to reward males for fertilisation, with the female orgasm simply a bonus arising from the way embryos of different sexes develop from a common form. Lloyd and Pavličev said it might be that the theories could be reconciled, with one potentially explaining the origin of female orgasm and the other indicating why it still existed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e1b6e97a818bf3cfd69b3bc3c8dd43cb786e364e/0_400_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d8bb08a2ecbf503db1c953be80c4337a","title":"downpours forensic analysis and lots of pasta on the team bus at the cycling worlds","story":" Australia was granted exclusive access to Australia’s male riders during the 2019 Road World Championships in YorkshireA decade ago, Cadel Evans became the first Australian to win the pinnacle one-day race on the international cycling calendar: the UCI Road World Championships road race. Last week, Canberra’s Michael Matthews travelled to Yorkshire hoping to replicate that feat, having placed second in 2015 and third in 2017.Treacherous English conditions turned the race into an epic, pushing the best riders in the world to breaking point. As Matthews and his seven Australian teammates fought for the rainbow jersey,  Australia was along for the ride.Australia’s technical director Brad McGee is holding court. In the lounge room of a grand rural residence converted into a rehabilitation centre for police, but occupied this week by several national teams, the Australian riders have gathered. A television screen in the corner shows a weather map, with heavy rain forecast. “Will I need a raft?” quips time trial world champion Rohan Dennis.The banter stops as a late-arriving team member is chastised. The mood instantly switches, with McGee’s expression becoming stern. “Boys,” begins the former Olympic gold medallist. “Our objective is to win.” Over the next hour and a half, McGee, performance director Simon Jones, technical analyst Dr Eric Haakonssen and Australia’s eight riders forensically dissect the 285kms standing between them and glory. “Our ideal scenario is Michael Matthews sprinting to victory with seven guys leading him out,” says McGee. He pauses, and then chuckles: “That might not happen.”Matthews is among the favourites, after recently outsprinting the other primary contenders in Canada. The Australians want to control the race from the start, and Dennis is told to ride hard on the front. “We’re going for the Team Sky look,” says Mitch Docker the British outfit was infamous for its conspicuous dominance of the peloton. “It is important, visually,” he adds.The discussion is lively, each rider offering their perspective and occasionally injecting humour. A major concern is information – unlike World Tour racing, national teams are not permitted to communicate by radio. Instead, Australia are deploying a traffic light system: at each feeding opportunity, staff members handing out bottles will wear coloured strips of material. Green means “all good”, yellow is an instruction to “be careful” and red indicates “crisis”, McGee explains.Once the tactics are agreed, each rider is asked to summarise their role. Nathan Haas, Jack Haig and Simon Clarke are Matthews’ key lieutenants – it is imperative all three are still in play late in the race. “It is going to be us eight guys against 200,” says Haas. Focus eventually turns to Matthews, who has remained mostly silent. “Behind us will be mayhem,” he says. “I need all of you. It is going to be war.”Finally, the meeting concludes. “Eat well, sleep better,” McGee instructs his charges. The menu is carbohydrate-heavy, featuring pasta, rice and potatoes. “Bon appetite.”6.50am, Sunday: team bus, en route to LeedsThe team rises early, with breakfast – toast, cereal, eggs and yet more pasta – served from 5.30am. The mood is subdued, with the riders mentally preparing for the toughest day of their season. As the bus departs for the start-line, word arrives that heavy rain overnight has necessitated a significant course change. Several climbs have been removed, with two additional laps of the final circuit around Harrogate added.“I think this is better,” Haas says. “It is a race we can control.” The others seem indifferent, although a few grumble about technical difficulties trying to update the course on their on-bike race computers. Once the commotion subsides, the riders return to their inidual preparations – adding numbers to their kits, cleaning cleats, imbibing espressos from the bus’s coffee machine. Matthews speaks to his wife on FaceTime Haig consults Haas about apartment renovation plans in Andorra.The bus is greeted in Leeds by several family members – team captain Rory Sutherland’s two children have brought along an inflatable boxing kangaroo, wearing a world champion’s jersey. Technical director Jones, a Briton who has been credited with overhauling Australian cycling since joining from Team Sky, is delighted by the kangaroo and disappears with it onto the bus.The team’s support staff, all employees of Australian-registered World Tour team Mitchelton-Scott, busy themselves preparing bikes, bottles and nutritional supplies. Mitchelton-Scott provided the team bus, as many other World Tour teams have for their respective nations. The blend of club and country offers an odd aesthetic Australia’s riders even have different helmets, reflecting the various sponsors of their trade teams.McGee has a final chat with his squad, but there are no rousing words of motivation. “This does not change anything for us,” he says of the late course revision. “If anything it plays to our strengths.” Outside the bus, Jones, having returned the inflatable kangaroo, exudes an aura of calm. “There is no point telling them what to do,” he says. “They’re the ones who have to do it.”The race rolls out 10 minutes behind schedule. McGee follows in the team car, while support staff scatter to different points of the route to offer bottles, feed bags and information. On the team bus, Jones has a live stream on one phone and is providing updates to the team WhatsApp group on another. Once an initial breakaway has formed, the commentator advises that, right on schedule, “Dennis moves to the front.” Jones reacts with a yell that reverberates around the bus: “Game on!”The rain becomes heavier the conditions are so bad that the helicopters which usually provide television footage have been grounded. “This is going to be such an epic day,” says Jones, with boyish enthusiasm. Earlier, McGee had been unperturbed by the weather. “These blokes don’t care,” he says. “If it’s rainy, put a jacket on. If it’s windy, put your head down. These are hardened, battle-ready bike riders. The weather is not an issue.”12.57pm, Sunday: team car, on-course with 124kms to goAs the peloton enters the Harrogate circuit after four hours on-course, Dennis becomes the first Australian rider to abandon. “We are on track,” says McGee. “We completed the first half to plan, and the stage is set for a big finish.”The team car convoy is ordered by UCI’s country rankings Australia, in ninth, are well behind the back of the peloton. McGee makes up for his lack of visuals by monitoring a live feed and the WhatsApp group – an impressive feat of multi-tasking as he speeds around the winding circuit – while a mechanic in the backseat relays orders to staff via radio. At one point McGee’s concentration is interrupted by a phone call from his son in Australia. “I’m just a little busy right now,” he offers apologetically.The downpour is unceasing. “It has not stopped raining all day,” says McGee, dry inside the team car as his riders endure the conditions. Despite the adverse weather, the circuit is lined with spectators. “It is like a Tour de France day in July,” the coach observes. “Except it’s wet and they have their wellies on.”More Australians drop as the kilometres tick down, but McGee is unconcerned. “We are burning them in the right order.” Suddenly the coach spots Clarke on the road ahead, distanced from the back of the peloton. “Fuck,” he yells. Clarke’s departure from the race with 40kms remaining was not part of the plan. “I got a hunger flat,” the rider explains through the car window. McGee regains composure: “We’ve still got a few cards here.”When Haas drops a kilometre later, just two Australians – Matthews and Haig – remain in the front group. The team’s prospects have swiftly diminished, but while the duo is in the race a medal is still possible. “It is pretty much all mental from here – you just have to back yourself,” says McGee.With three laps to go the race has become a battle of attrition, and barely a quarter of entrants have survived. When two riders attack, McGee ponders changing the colour scheme from yellow to red, but decides to keep it at “be careful”. A trio then launches from the peloton to join the breakaway. “It’s done,” he spits, after the escapees establish a 30-second advantage. “We don’t have the numbers to bring it back.” McGee is visibly deflated. “There is nothing we can do but sit and hope that another country chases.”Haig cracks with 18kms to go, while highly-rated Mathieu van der Poel suddenly falls back from the breakaway. The favourites are dropping like flies Julian Alaphilippe is another to go. “How the mighty have fallen,” says McGee, stunned by the number of big names who will not be making it to the finish. When Matthews loses contact with the chase group, with several kilometres remaining, Australia’s medal hopes are extinguished.The race is ultimately won by an unheralded 23-year-old Dane, Mads Petersen. Watching the sprint finish on the tiny screen in the team car, McGee is in disbelief. “This sport, hey? Brilliant, isn’t it.” Matthews rolls across the line in 24th place. Of the eight Australians who began the race in Leeds almost seven hours earlier, he is the only one to finish.Back on the bus, the team are enjoying post-race pizza as they swap notes about a tough day in the office. “That was,” Haas says, “an experience.” After completing his media duties, Matthews arrives looking shell-shocked and immediately heads for the shower. He emerges from the steam 10 minutes later, still bearing a vacant expression. “I tried to attack on the last lap, and all of a sudden I was going backwards rather than forwards,” he says.Once the bus arrives back at the accommodation, McGee immediately starts debriefing. Most of the riders have a beer in hand, for some their first alcoholic beverage of the year. The team take turns reflecting on their inidual performances, in the order they exited the race, before others add commentary. Docker does not mince his words: “It was fucking brutal.”The tone is broadly positive the riders feel there was little they could have done differently. McGee encourages constructive criticism, listening intently as Clarke outlines the challenges they faced receiving food from the roadside. “Is there a way we can do that better next year?” he asks.The team ponder how to overcome the conditions. “Every single person was cold,” says Haig. “It is not a coincidence that a Scandinavian won.” McGee suggests “there’s no preparing for a day like that”, but Jones is more pensive. “You can say it is down to the weather, but that’s merely a problem we haven’t solved,” he says. “Yet.”Just like the prior evening, attention finally switches to Matthews. “I want to say thank you,” he says. “Last night we outlined a plan, and today we executed.” Matthews may not be a typical leader, but his teammates are transfixed. “It was miserable out there today, but I did not hear one person complain. We stuck together – how’s that for team culture?”The other riders applaud, but Matthews is not finished. “We didn’t win, but we tried our best. Win, lose or draw, we have had an awesome day.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b3595aba7993014ffc0d2e0e1a1a95388ded21ff/0_345_5311_3187/master/5311.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4efbab9cec605453f04906b6eee423fc","title":"talking horses deirdre to miss arc in boost for enables hat trick hopes","story":"The Japanese mare was seen by some as an interesting alternative to Enable at Longchamp, but will now run in Ascot’s Champion Stakes insteadEnable’s path to a third Prix de l’Arc de Triomphe success has become slightly smoother with the news that the Japanese star Deirdre will not oppose her on Sunday.A shock winner of the Nassau Stakes this summer and an unlucky fourth in the Irish Champion Stakes last time, Deirdre was seen by some observers as an interesting alternative to the hot favourite for the Longchamp race. Her connections, however, have decided against stumping up the six-figure sum required to enter her at Wednesday’s supplementary stage.Instead, Deirdre will add international lustre to British Champions Day at Ascot a fortnight on Saturday. “The plan is for Deirdre to go for the Champion Stakes,” said Oisin Murphy, who has ridden Mitsuru Hashida’s mare in her past two races.“Her connections are pleased with her since the Irish Champion Stakes, where she should have finished closer. She’s a very good mare and it’s great we are getting another opportunity to see her in Britain.”Deirdre is a general 16-1 shot for the Champion Stakes, the last of the 20-1 having disappeared during Monday. It is hard to be sure what quality of opposition she would face there as the top four in the betting – Japan, Magical, Ghaiyyath and Enable – are all expected to run in the Arc, so their presence at Ascot would depend on what happens this weekend. A tilt at the Breeders’ Cup in the US next month must be a possibility for Deirdre, especially as she is thought to appreciate fast ground. But Murphy believes Ascot is the main target for her owner and trainer, at least for the time being.There are 16 horses left in the Arc, following Monday’s declaration stage, including three Japanese representatives in Fierement, Blast Onepiece and Kiseki. Britain has the same number of possible runners in Enable, Mehdaayih and Ghaiyyath.Meanwhile, Jean-Claude Rouget offered little help to punters as he discussed the Arc chances of his French Derby winner, Sottsass. “I am going into the Arc with confidence, but with a horse who has never encountered Enable, who has never encountered Japan, who has never really met anyone,” he said.“So I have no reference. I can’t say he is going to take his revenge or anything. I don’t know. What I do know is that the horse is looking good, he is in good form. Everything is all right.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fddc06f7af8a06d31768509bc7362be54316fc62/348_13_3324_1996/master/3324.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2197acd9aa74927f3ca05ff8f083b173","title":"dina asher smith 200m favourite gold world athletics","story":"• British 100m silver winner records women’s fastest of the day • Adam Gemili sails into men’s 200m final with 20.03 finishDina Asher-Smith insists she is not feeling the pressure to follow her 100m silver with a 200m world title – even though her biggest rivals are dropping like flies.The 23-year-old Briton finished fastest of all in the first round of the 200m, running a crisp 22.32sec, and is now a huge favourite for gold. But she warned: “Championships are inherently unpredictable and it’s just about how you handle the rounds, how you recover, how you sleep and make sure you execute each race.”It is natural that she wants to play down her chances. But not since Moses parted the Red Sea has a more dangerous looking passage suddenly become so sedate. First the world’s best 200m runner, Shaunae Miller-Uibo, was unable to double up because of scheduling problems and stuck to the 400m. Then Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce, the greatest female sprinter in history, withdrew on the advice of her coach after winning the 100m.On Monday more potential dangers fell by the wayside as the 2015 champion, Dafne Schippers, and 2017 silver medallist, Marie-Josée Ta Lou, withdrew with injuries – and Blessing Okagbare, one of the few to run faster than the Briton in 2019, was disqualified for stepping out of her lane in a heat.That leaves only Elaine Thompson, the Olympic champion, as a clear and present danger. However, the Jamaican revealed after finishing fourth in the 100m final that an Achilles tendon hurts every time she puts pressure on it. Two other Britons, Jodie Williams and Beth Dobbin, also made it safely through to the semi-finals.In the men’s 200m Adam Gemili is hoping to land his first major inidual medal after winning his semi-final in 20.03. “People have always said I should have medalled years ago,” he said. “People always say ‘potential’ with me. I don’t like that word. I’m 25 years old now. I need to start performing on a world stage. There’s no real excuses. My body’s healthy. I’ve done the training.”However, there was disappointment for Britain’s other two athletes as Zharnel Hughes failed to qualify after running only 20.30 and Miguel Francis pulled out with a quad strain.The organisers have been heavily criticised for poor crowds during the first three days but the thousands of army staff and migrant workers who were bussed in on Monday created a cracking atmosphere, particularly in the men’s 5,000m, which turned into a classic.From an early stage it was clear it would be a battle between the 19-year-old Norwegian Jakob Ingebrigtsen and a pack of fearsome Ethiopians. Surprisingly it was Ingebrigtsen who struck for home first but around the final bend it became clear he had nothing left. That left the 2017 champion, Muktar Edris, to spring a surprise by retaining his title in 12:58.85. His compatriot Selemon Barega took silver while Canada’s Mohammad Ahmed claimed bronze. A spent Ingebrigtsen, meanwhile, swallow-ed over the line to finish fifth.There was greater joy for Norway in the men’s 400m hurdles as Karsten Warholm retained his title with a thunderous display of front-running to come home in 47.42 sec. Rai Benjamin of the USA pushed him all the way and won silver in 47.66, while the home favourite Abderrahman Samba took bronze.The women’s high jump final turned into an extraordinary battle between the reigning champion, Mariya Lasitskene, from Russia, and the 18-year-old Yaroslava Mahuchikh of Ukraine, with both clearing 2.04m before the Russian, competing as a neutral, won on countback. Vashti Cunningham of the US claimed bronze.In the women’s 3,000m steeplechase, meanwhile, Beatrice Chepkoech led from gun to tape to win in 8:57.84, ahead of the reigning champion Emma Coburn from the US, with Germany’s Gesa Krause third.Finally the post-Caster Semenya era in the women’s 800m began with a shock as the Ugandan Halimah Nakaayi took gold, with the pre-race favourite Ajee Wilson having to settle for bronze.Meanwhile Laura Muir, who begins her 1500m campaign on Wednesday, insists she is fit enough to go for gold despite missing six weeks of running after tearing her calf in late July. “It’s not been the most ideal preparation over these past couple of months so to win a medal, especially gold, would be an even bigger achievement,” she said. “That’s definitely still on the table.”The 26-year-old also revealed that she has kept fit by cross-training in the pool twice a day and that her fitness is “still pretty good” after running some “really brutal training sessions”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f0edac656e5950816567c52723a3dfa0d741d0f1/627_145_6093_3656/master/6093.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b2c0eeac8f6ad0b158126a2d0c3db5fb","title":"yorkshires road cycling championships in pictures","story":"The UCI road world championships took place in the Yorkshire dales amid relentless rainAbout 1,400 riders from 90 countries competed in the UCI road world cycling championships, which ploughed through the Yorkshire dales, culminating in Harrogate.Nearly 2 million spectators turned out to watch the 2019 Tour de Yorkshire and 4 million fans visited the county to support the Tour de France Grand Départ in 2014, among the largest crowds ever for cycling events in the UK.The peloton rolled out to the north of Bradford before the first categorised ascent on Norwood Edge, a winding ramp which distanced some of the weaker climbers. A final undulating approach into Harrogate and two laps of the city circuit proved a war of attrition before Annemiek van Vleuten won the world champion titleYorkshire hosted the first ever team time trial mixed relay, with national teams consisting of three male and three female riders. The men set off first and the women replaced them on the road as soon as the second male rider crossed the finish line. Final timings were taken when the second female rider crossed the line.It was the first UCI-sanctioned international para-cycling event to take place alongside the UCI road world championships and was used as a qualifier for the Tokyo 2020 Paralympics.The route headed in a south-westerly direction out of Northallerton, followed by a short, sharp ascent on the outskirts of Masham. After a fast section into Risplith, there was barely a flat metre of road. The riders had to keep something in reserve before one last blast into Harrogate and up to the finish line on Parliament Street.Mads Pedersen became Denmark’s first road world champion. “When I saw the finish line I hoped the pain would be gone and I could do a good sprint. After six-and-a-half hours on the bike there is not much left. You have to be focused and stay in front. Don’t get any bad luck. It’s every rider’s dream to wear that jersey. For me to do it now is unbelievable.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0148b5f3440283ed43c969fecdd0e0043580bbe2/244_0_2140_1284/master/2140.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=069db11f1e10d901ec56035e820358ff","title":"doha empty seats iaaf sellout world athletics championships","story":"IAAF’s sellout to Qatar was the first leg of a double which sees the 2021 follow-up take place in Eugene, Oregon, home of NikeWhen Adam Gemili walked towards his blocks in lane seven for his heat of the men’s 200m at the IAAF world championships in Doha on Sunday night, he looked up and waved to friends and family in the grandstand. They would not have been hard to spot among a crowd estimated at around 1,000 scattered around a stadium built for 40,000.On perhaps the worst weekend for athletics in the sport’s long history there seemed no end to the ways being found to insult the people who actually do the running, jumping and throwing. All the poisons to have entered the sport’s systems in recent times were pooling in the echoing emptiness of the air-conditioned Khalifa stadium.Later in the evening that same 1,000 or so watched Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce, the queen of Jamaica, win the women’s 100m ahead of Dina Asher-Smith, who was taking the first inidual medal for a British female sprinter since Kathy Cook in 1983. Nothing can stir the blood as profoundly and sometimes unexpectedly as athletics, and this was a wonderful race containing all the ingredients required for a memorable final of a blue-riband event.The 32-year-old Jamaican, a little ball of pure speed trailing her multicoloured hair like the tail of a psychedelic comet, was winning her fourth world title at the distance, to go with her Olympic gold medals in Beijing and London. Later she gave interviews while cuddling her son Zyon, whose birth in 2017 kept her away from the track for a year.Trailing the woman described by Michael Johnson as the greatest woman sprinter of all time by barely a tenth of a second, Asher-Smith is nine years younger and was giving notice that, barring mishaps, even more impressive achievements await as she matures and gathers experience. To look at these women in their moment of triumph one could easily imagine them to be representing a sport at the zenith of its popularity.And yet the 38,000 or so empty seats told a very different story: a tale of sickness, corruption, warped priorities and vested interests. That depressing message was only italicised when the lights dimmed before the 100m final, giving way to a hideous Vegas-style son-et-lumière, intended to impress us with the importance of the race we were about to watch. We already knew that, thank you very much. It would have been better to give these amazing women a full house to cheer them on and to award their lap of honour the reception it deserved.The way to sell athletics to a new generation is not to wrap it up in something resembling the staging of the latest worldwide tour from Rihanna or Taylor Swift. The secret of the most beautiful of sports is to be found in its simplicity and humanity. The public enjoyed the sight of Usain Bolt throwing a shape before and after a victory but it was incidental to his global appeal. What people really loved was the sight of a man sprinting faster than anyone had done before: so basic, so elemental, so pure.The pollution of that purity is something athletics has been fighting against for decades, and in particular from the day of the 1988 men’s Olympic 100m final: the one that gave its title to Richard Moore’s book, The Dirtiest Race in History. Six of the eight finalists that day in Seoul – and not just the disqualified winner on the track, Ben Johnson – were subsequently implicated in doping scandals. On Sunday night in Doha that shadow, now more than 30 years old, dimmed the spotlight falling on the men’s 100m medal ceremony. The man on the top step of the podium, Christian Coleman, recently escaped a ban for missing three drug tests on a technicality, while the doping history of Justin Gatlin, the runner-up, is too familiar to bear repeating. It was as if Bolt had never happened.Athletics is a resilient sport and there have been cherishable moments in the opening days of these world championships, as there always are on such occasions. There was Angelica Bengtsson of Sweden feeling a pole snap as she went into the take-off for her vault, then getting up and grabbing another one and setting off again to clear the bar. There was Braima Dabo of Guinea‑Bissau helping the heat‑stricken Jonathan Busby of Aruba to finish their 5,000m race, both far behind the winners. And the great Allyson Felix, another new mother, returning to win her 12th world title in the inaugural mixed 4x400m, itself a good entertainment which may or may not be destined for a permanent place in the programme.But then one remembers that two years after the lights go out in Doha the next IAAF world championships will take place in Eugene, Oregon, notable in terms of world athletics only for being the town where Nike was founded and has its world headquarters. Nike, the running shoe company who gave Sebastian Coe the contract that he was so loth to forfeit when he became president of the IAAF four years ago in succession to the man he once described as the sport’s “spiritual leader”, the disgraced Lamine Diack. Nike, the company whose negotiations with Felix over a new contract when she became pregnant started a battle over fair payment for sportswomen during the maternity period.The award of the championships to Eugene was made without transparency in any respect save that of the motives of those who also decided that it was right to hold a marathon in the heat of Qatar and were rewarded on Friday night with the sight of runners being taken to hospital in wheelchairs. One day the successors to those athletes will get the sport – and the audience – they deserve."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d74b9fbef7521f76255f0f1c53a4fa8befb188e3/1489_3819_5050_3029/master/5050.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6c8d26ff5268200d5b10b00f17d33a84","title":"reykjavik standup ari eldjarn icelander comedy london","story":"The former flight attendant started standup as a dare – now he’s a sellout star. But how will his Nordic innuendos work in England?This winter, comedian Ari Eldjárn will play to thousands of people in his home town of Reykjavík. Seventeen shows in nine days in a 1,000-seat venue. It’s an annual tradition for the Icelandic standup, whose easygoing tales and punchy jokes have made him the biggest comedian in the country. But when he performed his first shows in English – two years ago at the Edinburgh fringe – he was delighted when 40 people showed up. “I had no PR, no agent,” says Eldjárn. “I didn’t know whether that was a good crowd or not. It turns out, in Edinburgh, that’s a very decent amount!”A former flight attendant, Eldjárn started standup a decade ago “as a dare”. Two of his friends gave comedy a shot and, at their second gig, invited their pal to perform too. “There was a huge appetite for comedy in Iceland at the time,” explains the 38-year-old. “I think it had something to do with the fact that the country almost went bankrupt the year before.” Eldjárn soon quit his job as a copywriter to become a full-time comedian with his friends. “We formed a group, and we’ve performed 500 times since then, selling a combined total of 90,000 tickets in 10 years.” For a country with a population of 360,000, that’s mightily impressive.In Iceland, Eldjárn has had several TV specials, sold out theatres for months on end and performed with the Icelandic National Symphony. “You think: I can’t believe I can do this bit and then introduce a piece by Mozart – and it works,” he says. “I got to conduct the symphony too, which went terribly. I did a long roast about conductors and how they aren’t really doing any work, just waving a stick. Apparently it’s way more complicated.”Eldjárn writes a new 80 minutes of material each year for his end-of-year shows. When he translates those jokes into English, ‘“it’s like a rebirth of material”.At home, Eldjárn’s stories of everyday life in Iceland are observational and relatable. Abroad, that material takes on a new educational form as he explains Icelandic living to foreigners. ‘“But it gets the same reaction – that’s the bizarre thing. You just need one line of backstory or background.”Anecdotal material is simple to translate. But some routines – especially those with wordplay – require word-by-word micro-translation. And there’s a limit to what can be converted to English. “I had a long routine about mindfulness and yoga, and that’s my favourite bit in Icelandic because it has four killer puns in a row. But it was impossible to translate!”With so much work and a huge fanbase in Iceland, it must be tempting to never leave home. But Eldjárn says it’s been “incredibly refreshing and a complete adventure” to perform in the UK. “Iceland works as a really good place for me to write and to stay active. But to go to the UK and get a good reception to your stuff – in my mind, that means you’ve made it.”• Ari Eldjárn: Eagle Fire Iron is at Soho theatre, London, 7-12 October."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/840e0d30305de73f14c67fe60af587cf619f11aa/0_157_2998_1799/master/2998.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=77caccdd4932944d4aa4f33680a4e528","title":"great uk activity hub win 200 pound hotel voucher","story":"Outdoor breaks often have a vibrant base camp offering a wide range of activities, plus advice and pit stops on hand, and a chance to socialise.

And remember, the man behind the decks does not take requests. Follow these simple edicts and you’ll thoroughly enjoy this idiosyncratic barThere are few places in Tokyo as polarising as Bar Martha. Online reviews congregate heavily around both ends of the scale and, depending which you listen to, it is either the “worst experience in Tokyo” or “brilliantly unapologetic” and “coolest place in the city”.This is no accident – few things are at this bar. Rather it is the product of the take-no-prisoners attitude of the bar’s owner, Wataru Fukuyama, a 56-year-old visionary or tyrant, according to your take on him.Bar Martha is what is known in Japan as a listening bar, where music comes first and talking a definite second. Though there are others in the city – JBS and Grandfather’s are among the better-known – Bar Martha, in Tokyo’s Ebisu neighbourhood, is further off the beaten track, patronised by Japanese audiophiles and well-dressed locals.Those who talk too loudly or disturb the atmosphere are liable to be unceremoniously thrown out. This is not a place to visit in a large group ready for loud and lively conversation groups larger than two or three should head instead to an izakaya (pub).What Fukuyama likes is music. Enter the softly lit, cavernous bar space and, after a brief explanation of the rules, you’ll be greeted by a vast wall of more than 6,000 vinyl records, which Fukuyama plays on twin turntables. Music is played across two 1960s Tannoy speakers, which Fukuyama chose for a vintage quality that sounds “akin to a rainy day in the UK”, where the speakers were originally built.“I look at the customers and think ‘who is listening?’” says Fukuyama. “Only 50 people can be in here at any one time. I often play music for the one person who is listening most intently. I think to myself, ‘How old are they? What would they want to listen to?’ I play something and watch for their reaction.”Over the course of an evening, the soundtrack shifts from mellow Ella Fitzgerald to the raucous clang of The Clash’s “Should I Stay or Should I Go”, shifting with the flow of customers in and out of the bar. The music is never static, never dwells on one genre for too long.Nestled between and in front of the speakers are rows of high-end bottles of whisky, glistening beneath spotlights. The spirit is Bar Martha’s main focus, but the menu is all-encompassing, and ranges from draft beer through to a very enjoyable mango mojito.The 50 seats are spread between a long wooden counter (sit here to be closest to the bartenders, the vinyls and the watchful eye of Fukuyama) and more intimate hardwood tables in the recesses toward the back.All designed by Fukuyama, it is extraordinarily photogenic, but here comes the most frequent sticking point: photos are absolutely forbidden Fukuyama doesn’t use the internet and has no desire for a presence on social media.

And that’s just one of the countless things that would be hit by – say – a sudden proliferation of border tariffsThe older I get – and I seem to have got much older since it started – the more I think that beneath all the proximate causes of Brexit (xenophobia, lies, loss of sovereignty, Bruxellian overreach delete according to taste) lies the deeper, simpler one of complacency. Life got too easy, too cushioned, too safe. We had no idea what it takes – took – to maintain it. No idea of the vast web of interconnections supporting our daily lives, no appreciation of the safety net underneath us, not even the slightest sense of the invisible hands working to keep us fed, watered, healthy and provided for in the most privileged time in western history to be alive. If we had, perhaps everything would … Well. Anyway. We are, very much, where we are.I’m not sure if What Britain Buys and Sells in a Day was supposed to have such an emotional effect on viewers, but I have my suspicions. It was on the wrong channel (BBC Two) at the wrong hour (post-watershed) and fronted by at least one of the wrong presenters (former shadow chancellor Ed Balls) to be entirely what it purported to be. Namely, one of those cheery documentaries that amount to an hour-long version of the Sesame Street clips that showed you how rubber bands were made – a straightforward invitation to gaze in awe at man’s ingenuity and the vast scale of operations we can now command.Yes, it gave us plenty of sights and statistics to goggle and boggle at. The ship laden with 17,000 of the 3m refrigerated containers circumnavigating the globe at any one time, containing 30 tons of goods each. The 4,500-hectare (11,000-acre) tomato farm in the Netherlands, with greenhouses so big that standing inside you cannot see one end from the other. The fact that vineyard owners in Kent are growing their grapes along the same geological ridge that dips under the Channel and resurfaces in Champagne, France.But it was also an hour in which Balls, Cherry Healey and Ade Adepitan traced the routes, processes and interdependences upon which Britain’s imports and exports of fruit and vegetables depend. And, not incidentally, outlined the major crimp that would be put in the step of everyone from shoppers to avocado farmers in Peru if these things were to be interrupted by – say – a sudden proliferation of border controls, new tariffs, trade deals and the like.It was made explicit that we are not self-sufficient. The disparities between what we import and export were bell-like in their clarity. By 7am, £5.5m worth of fruit and veg has arrived on our shores and less than half a million quid’s worth gone out. By 2pm, we have generally taken in 4.4m apples and sent out about 250,000 (a lot go to the Middle East, where they prize a larger size than we find convenient. Yes, you may indeed take a moment to ponder the level of decadence we have all reached and wonder if it would be so bad if everything were razed to the ground and we were given no choice but to start again and do better next time. This is another of the glorious tensions provided by our liminal times.)It was explained that our climate means we will always depend on imports. That efficient logistics are vital to our economy. A few minutes’ delay on each lorry crossing our borders in the wake of new rules will soon translate into supply bottlenecks and increased prices. They didn’t touch on what would happen when no one is clear about a damn thing, which may of course be our situation this time next month.This three-part series will no doubt be dismissed by some as mere propaganda. But if so, God, how I would welcome some equally sights-and-statistics-based propaganda from the other side to redress the balance. Rebut anything thus, leavers, please. The fact that you cannot, will not do so is what has me most convinced that we are about to be trapped on starvation rations on an island that didn’t know how good it had it or how much silent effort went into making it so. Haven’t we all been shaken out of our complacency sufficiently now?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d708cf465c4e1d0780da8920f8add6372eb2b504/0_29_1772_1063/master/1772.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=293d5b9bd2098e4785f98505edb9826b","title":"john wayne california airport racism homophobia","story":"The actor had secured a firm spot in American history until a controversial interview surfaced revealing his troubling viewsJohn Wayne is Americana personified. His name conjures up images of sunsets, cowboy hats and Marlboro Reds. But the legacy of the late film star is undergoing fresh interrogation after a controversial 1971 Playboy interview resurfaced online in which the actor made racist and homophobic comments. Now, there are growing calls to rename the John Wayne airport, located in Orange county, in response to the actor’s troubling political views.The idea of renaming an airport because of a namesake’s controversial political views might have seemed far-fetched a decade ago, but not anymore.A host of public schools and colleges have renamed academic buildings and dorms that honor Confederate leaders. Efforts to rename DC’s Reagan airport, in response to Ronald Reagan’s war on crime, which disproportionately affected people of color, have been on-and-off since 2015. Barack Obama arguably cleared the way for major name-changes when he used his executive power to rename Mount McKinley to Denali, the mountain peak’s original name among the area’s indigenous population.So names can change.Up until now, John Wayne’s legacy has occupied a comfortable, permanent position in American history. Wayne starred in over 70 films, received a Congressional Medal of Honor and a posthumous Presidential Medal of Freedom.There are a lot of places named after him. There’s an elementary school in Brooklyn, a marina in Washington state, a highway in central Arizona, a park in Newport Beach.Wayne was disturbingly forthcoming and direct in the Playboy interview when it came to his racism. “I believe in white supremacy until the blacks are educated to a point of responsibility,” he told Playboy in 1971. “I don’t believe in giving authority and positions of leadership and judgment to irresponsible people.”Is it possible to rewrite the legacy of the biggest movie star of all time?“For many years, I have been troubled with the decision to name an airport after John Wayne because of his bigoted views on African Americans, the LGBT+ community and Native Americans,” Whiting says of his decision to write his isive call for action. “Although most of the hundreds of online and email comments are passionately negative, there are also notes of support.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f468ddd900092679ca2d5f8f32eb2fe1dc6af267/0_232_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dcf0aa13fc59f20ef02b77b89515c3d1","title":"china celebrates 70 years military parade xi jinping hong kong","story":"New weapons – including a hypersonic drone and a ballistic missile that can reach the US – are expected to make their public debutChina will celebrate 70 years of Communist party supremacy on Tuesday with a parade of tanks, missiles and troops, a muscular display of its rising superpower status as it faces an unprecedented challenge to its authority in Hong Kong.Authorities in Beijing have closed roads, banned the flying of kites, and shut some bars as they tightened security for an event celebrating China’s journey from a country broken by war and poverty to being the world’s second-largest economy.The massive military parade will roll across Tiananmen Square under the gaze of President Xi Jinping, the country’s most powerful leader since Mao Zedong, who founded the People’s Republic of China on October 1, 1949.New weapons – including a hypersonic drone and an intercontinental ballistic missile that can reach the United States – are expected to make their public debut, according to Paris-based analysts.“Unity is iron and steel. Unity is a source of strength,” Xi said in a speech on Monday evening.But behind the projection of strength at the tightly-choreographed event, a clutch of challenges are testing Xi’s ability to maintain economic and political stability at home and abroad.“The party hopes that this occasion will add to its legitimacy and rally support at a time of internal and external challenges,” Adam Ni, China researcher at Macquarie University in Sydney, said.US trade war negotiations have dragged on, and African swine fever has raced through the country’s pig supply, sending pork prices soaring.After more than 20 years of civil war, Mao Zedong leads the communists to victory over the nationalists, and proclaims the founding of the People\u0027s Republic of China on 1 October.China launches a five-year economic plan, the Great Leap Forward,\u0026nbsp collectivising farming and investing in heavy industry.

The country\u0027s human rights record also comes under scrutiny for its treatment of the Uighurs, with claims that more than 1 million of them have been detained in camps the Chinese have euphemistically called\u0026nbsp“vocational education centres”.But the major headache is Hong Kong, where pro-democracy protesters plan to grab the spotlight from Beijing on Tuesday with their own rally against what they see as the erosion of their special freedoms.The semi-autonomous territory has been embroiled for months in the worst unrest since Britain returned the financial hub to China in 1997, with police and hardcore protesters trading tear gas for petrol bombs.In an apparent olive branch, Xi vowed on Monday to continue to “fully and faithfully implement” the one country-two systems policy under which Hong Kong residents enjoy freedoms unseen on the mainland.But Hong Kong’s chief executive, Carrie Lam, was invited to the national day celebration, highlighting Beijing’s continued support for the under-fire leader.Communist party grandees will watch as 15,000 soldiers march across Tiananmen, 580 pieces of military equipment are shown off and 160 aircraft roar overhead.“Beijing wants to highlight its military modernisation, political unity, and determination to protect its interests,” Ni said.The Communist party has repeatedly defied the odds to remain in power for seven decades.Under Mao, tens of millions of people died during the disastrous Great Leap Forward, and the country was plunged into violent chaos during the decade-long Cultural Revolution.After Mao died in 1976, the party launched the reform and opening-up policy under the paramount leader Deng Xiaoping, starting decades of breakneck growth and development.But the Communist party retained a stranglehold on power, sending troops to end the biggest challenge to its rule in 1989 when pro-democracy protesters occupied Tiananmen Square.Xi’s address on Tuesday is likely to invoke his “Chinese dream”, the “rejuvenation” of a nation that is seeking what it sees as a return to former glory.The party wants to show “that under the leadership of the CCP, China is making strides toward becoming a rich and powerful country”, said Bonnie Glaser, senior adviser for Asia at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.The Chinese leader has made clear that be believes only the Communist party can make the country realise its dream – with him at the helm."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8bfce72f2cfbde3b8f6da91dc03cc0ff8c7f272a/0_49_3559_2136/master/3559.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c81b01eacfb33b9645ea59086f62de39","title":"austria elections offer latest sign far right rise faltering","story":"The slump in support for the nationalist Freedom party (FPÖ) in Austria’s elections on Sunday is the latest indication that if the tide has not turned against Europe’s far-right populists, it does seem – for the time being, at least – to have stopped rising.Voters deserted the FPÖ after its leader, Heinz-Christian Strache, was filmed offering lucrative public contracts in exchange for campaign support to a woman claiming to be the niece of a Russian oligarch. But the result fits into a wider continental pattern of far-right, nationalist and populist parties facing increasingly stiff political or institutional resistance and failing to capitalise on their advances in the polls to the extent that many observers had predicted.While the social and economic discontent and the dissatisfaction with Europe’s mainstream parties that fuelled their recent surge have far from vanished, the populists seem no more able than anyone else in Europe’s fragmenting political landscape to secure clear majorities for their cause.In Italy, the former interior minister Matteo Salvini, of the far-right League party, is out in the cold after collapsing the government in the mistaken belief that his soaring poll ratings meant the country wanted a hard turn to the right.Instead his coalition partners, the anti-establishment Five Star Movement, formed a government with the centre-left Democratic party, and while Salvini will doubtless be back, for the moment the nationalists are nursing a self-inflicted bloody nose.In elections in two crucial German regions this month, the far-right, anti-immigrant Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) party made big gains and posted record scores, but it did not win in either and was shut out of power in both.In France, Emmanuel Macron seemed under serious threat earlier this year, shaken by the violent Saturday demonstrations of the gilets jaunes (yellow vest) movement and the advance of the far-right National Rally of Marine Le Pen. But the centrist president is now ahead in the polls, his approval rating at its highest since July 2018. With Le Pen failing to land a knockout blow in May’s European elections – she won by a whisker, and with a smaller share of the vote than in 2014 – and the French economy faring better than many, Macron will be quietly optimistic.In Spain, the far-right Vox party has managed to lose ground in the polls despite the failure of the Socialist prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, to form a government and support for Thierry Baudet’s Forum for Democracy (FvD) in the Netherlands has plummeted following infighting and isions.Far-right and illiberal populism continues to prosper in Poland and Hungary. But elsewhere in central Europe, the Czech prime minister, Andrej Babiš, is facing some of the biggest protests since the fall of communism, and the new president of Slovakia is a progressive liberal.The underlying causes of far-right populism – rising inequality, austerity, fear of immigration, globalisation, automation – remain, and the parties they sustain are fixtures in Europe’s political landscape. In several countries, far-right policies, particularly on immigration, have been adopted and normalised by both the centre right and centre left.But as the Austrian results confirm, the nationalists are not having things all their own way."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ab08a5760e7210afceaf9c61869a55a444b1b2b/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=33ff4280ba10050d7f1b506510ca620d","title":"canadian joshua boyle taliban hostage trial closing","story":"In closing arguments, Joshua Boyle’s defence attempted to smooth out the damaging parts of his testimonyThe Canadian man who spent five years as a hostage in Afghanistan with his American wife, is “arrogant” and “argumentative”– but is nonetheless not guilty of abusing his wife, defence lawyers have argued, as the closely-watched criminal trial neared its end.Joshua Boyle’s legal team suggested on Monday that, while their client could be frustrating “to the point of infuriating”, these personal deficiencies should not be construed as guilt.Boyle, 36, has pleaded not guilty to 19 charges of assault, sexual assault and unlawful confinement.Wearing a caramel-coloured shirt with a red corduroy vest, Boyle sat in an Ottawa courtroom with his parents and sister, frequently taking notes on a white legal pad.Caitlan Coleman, and her mother Linda, participated in the proceedings through video link at the Canadian embassy in Washington DC.Boyle and Coleman, who married in 2011, were kidnapped during a trip to Afghanistan in 2012. The pair were later transferred to the control of the militant Haqqani network. The couple had three children while in captivity and in November 2017, the family was freed by Pakistani forces. After release, they moved to Ottawa, until Boyle was arrested on 31 December 2017.During closing arguments on Monday, Greenspon highlighted parts of Boyle’s testimony which he admitted were damaging for the accused.Boyle admitted to criticizing his wife, fighting often and striking her once while the two were in captivity, said Greenspon.“He told the truth … where adopting a different path would have been much simpler,” he said.Greenspon said that a list of demands from Boyle which Coleman had described (including instructions on her weight, and the frequency of sexual intercourse) was nothing more than a list of “New Year’s resolutions”.Greenspon also took aim at Coleman’s testimony, suggesting it was “neither credible nor reliable”.Before the two sides began closing arguments, the court heard about the erosion of the marriage between Coleman and Boyle as lawyers re-examined witnesses.Coleman also vigorously denied a suggestion from the defence that she traded chocolate with the guards for “mock execution” of Boyle. “That is absolutely not correct,” she said.Under examination by the crown, Coleman described feelings of inadequacy both in captivity and while the couple lived in Ottawa.“I struggled with shame … he was telling me I wasn’t a good enough wife. I felt like I couldn’t possibly be the person he’s always demanding,” said.While much of the early trial focused on the allegations of sexual abuse towards Coleman, the defence has spent recent weeks unearthing documentation and testimony to suggest that the acts Coleman has accused Boyle of were consensual.The trial, which began in March, has been plagued by delays – including while the court considered whether Coleman’s sexual history should be admitted.Despite a judge’s order not to speak publicly about the case, Coleman granted a number of interviews to Canadian and American media outlets, prompting a number of procedural tangents in the trial.The prosecution will rest its case in the coming days. Boyle has opted for the trial to be overseen by a judge only."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Proposed changes will free Enterprise Ireland to help companies affected by BrexitNon-paper on customs posts relies \u0026lsquoon technology that does not yet exist\u0026rsquo Keir Starmer saysElderly farmer had been attending to livestock before he was later found unconsciousPriest calls for community to \u0026lsquoeliminate any disharmony in our midst\u0026rsquoCourt ruling on formula for medical claims led to increased liability costsBad tenancies and ignorance of rights have seen more central and eastern European men become homeless in DublinPiece with \u0026euro20,000 estimate stolen from Lancashire school discovered in Dublin\u0026lsquoInformation campaign\u0026rsquo to inform public in North soon about the impending legal changesNotice has been issued by PharmaSwiss as the pens may fail to produce an injectionFerry services unlikely to return to Dun Laoghaire, chief executive tells councillorsMet \u0026Eacuteireann models see most likely path hit west coast on ThursdayPostmortems carried out on Patrick Hogan (30) and Jonathan Healy (24)Just 22,500 hectares of land planted against a target of over 27,000 since 2015C\u0026ampAG report finds overspend of 12.7 per cent in farm assist payments costing \u0026euro9.4 millionIreland\u0026rsquos underperformance on climate action and renewable energy already set to cost \u0026euro125m in fines and buying carbon creditsFormer taoiseach says peace agreement \u0026lsquois all about convergence\u0026rsquo, not ergenceNew group formed by Paul Murphy joins crowded space on Ireland\u0026rsquos political left"},{"url":null,"title":"leaked british proposals on the border utterly unworkable","story":"Leaked British proposals to establish customs posts on both sides of the Border after Brexit have been described by opposition in the UK as “utterly unworkable”.“If Boris Johnson had spent any time listening to businesses and communities in Northern Ireland, he would know that these proposals are utterly unworkable” Shadow secretary of state for Brexit Keir Starmer tweeted , linking to a story by RTÉ. The proposals contained in papers tabled in talks with EU negotiators and reported on Monday night. RTÉ reported that the British ideas were contained in “non-papers” — documents tabled for discussion purposes — submitted to the EU in recent weeks, and would see a string of “customs clearance sites” established on both sides of the border to manage the flow of goods between North and South.It reported that these centres would be 8km to 16km back from the Border. “They would place an enormous administrative burden on businesses and rely on technology that does not yet exist,” Mr Starmer tweeted. “If accurate, these proposals represent yet another failure of the Government’s negotiating strategy. The Prime Minister should admit he has no credible plan for Brexit and that the only way to resolve this issue is to go back to the people with a public vote,” he said. “Crucially, if true, they represent a rowing back on the commitments made to the people of Northern Ireland two years ago that there would be no return to a hard border or related checks or controls.”Earlier, a British government source said new proposals would be handed over to EU negotiators on Wednesday or Thursday.

It wasn’t perfect.’ Photograph: Andrew Caballero-ReynoldsAFPGetty ImagesIt’s a beautiful day for an impeachment. Or at least an inquiry about an impeachment inquiry. So on Friday, as summer stretched on, I went to the Capitol to see what the speaker of the House was thinking, now that she has lowered the boom.At the tender age of 73, Donald Trump may finally have to face some consequences for his depredations. His casino games have caught up with him and this time Daddy’s not here to bail him out. How delicious that a woman has the whip hand. “Isn’t it something, Maureen?” Nancy Pelosi asks about what she calls her “wild week”. I nod. It surely is.“The president says you’re no longer speaker of the House, that you’ve been taken over by the radical left,” I say to Pelosi, who looks smart in a pink pantsuit and sparkly pink high heels. She laughs.“See, I always think he’s projecting. When he says, ‘She’s not the speaker of the House,’ what he really means is, ‘I shouldn’t be president of the United States. ’ When he says that Adam Schiff should resign, what he really means is, ‘I, Donald Trump, should resign.’ He knows that this is really very incriminating.”The speaker is in a fine mood, now that she’s turned her focus from reining in the progressives to reining in the president. Does she no longer think, as she said for months, that impeachment is so isive that it needs to be a bipartisan effort?“No, I said I hoped it would be bipartisan. I still hope so. It’s up to the Republicans whether they honour their oath of office or honour their oath of Trump.”I ask her how she feels about those who say she came to this moment belatedly. “I don’t come to anything belatedly,” she shoots back. “I have said from the start, we’ll go where the facts take us and we will be ready. And we are ready. And they’re shocked.”Epic tantrumTrump was clearly smarting that Pelosi is now on the side of an impeachment inquiry. Is the high-chair king about to have his most epic tantrum yet? Even Trump’s pal Chris Ruddy told NPR that the president may not understand the implications of the inquiry or that he’s going up against “the smartest person in Washington right now”, as Ruddy called Pelosi.The speaker would have preferred to send Trump packing at the ballot box. But since he keeps contaminating the ballot box, asking foreign countries to meddle in our elections to help him win, what choice did she have? The man who always claims the system is rigged against him keeps trying to rig the system – proving Pelosi’s point that Trump projects.About the White House officials who engaged in what she calls “the cover-up of the cover-up”, she notes: “You’d think that there would be some sense of decency on the part of the people who work for the president.”I ask her when the last time she talked to Trump was. “You mean the latest?” she says, laughing. “It may be the last.” They were talking about gun violence on the phone on Tuesday morning when the president suddenly changed the topic to the whistleblower complaint. “My conversation with the president was one in which he said the phone call was perfect and he couldn’t wait until I saw it because it was perfect. It wasn’t perfect.”The White House says it plans to work with Democrats in Congress even less than usual. On Friday, The New York Times reported that Trump met with NRA ghoul Wayne LaPierre to talk about how the NRA can chip in some blood money for the president’s defence if he stops “the games” – “the games” being any attempt to curb our periodic human sacrifices. Hasn’t Trump learned his lesson about scummy quid pro quos? It’s hard to fathom why he would slip the noose on Robert Mueller’s testimony on Russia, and then turn around the very next day and ask Ukraine to interfere in an American election.“I’ve said before, I do not have the medical background to analyse the president’s behaviour,” Pelosi says.Last tabooMaybe it’s time to break the last taboo and put a psychiatrist on staff at the White House to analyse a president’s mental state, or possible impairment?“No, I think the White House should have an honest lawyer on staff,” she says, “and not a rogue justice department.”Speaking of rogue justice and psychiatric emergencies, what does she make of America’s mayor becoming America’s nightmare?“I’m focused on the president,” she says, adding disgustedly about Rudy Giuliani: “I mean, that’s almost like a joke.”She did not arrive at her decision lightly. In between speaking at two funerals – that of Cokie Roberts, the journalist, and Emily Clyburn, the wife of the House majority whip Jim Clyburn – she talked to her members, lawyers and constitutional experts. “I had one phone call it lasted all weekend,” she says dryly. She drafted her historic statement Monday night on the plane from New York to DC.“‘Betrayal’ was a word that my members wanted me to use,” she says. “I didn’t have that in my original statement. Betrayal of the constitution. Betrayal of our national security.

Dan Walker, the BBC Breakfast co-host who instigated the conversation about Mr Trump, escaped censure.In an email to staff, Lord Hall said: “The Executive Complaints Unit ruling has sparked an important debate about racism and its interpretation. Racism is racism and the BBC is not impartial on the topic. There was never a finding against Naga for what she said about the President’s tweet.“Many of you asked that I personally review the decision of the ECU. I have done so. I have looked carefully at all the arguments that have been made and assessed all of the materials. I have also examined the complaint itself. It was only ever in a limited way that there was found to be a breach of our guidelines. These are often finely balanced and difficult judgements.“But, in this instance, I don’t think Naga’s words were sufficient to merit a partial uphold of the complaint around the comments she made. There was never any sanction against Naga and I hope this step makes that absolutely clear. She is an exceptional journalist and presenter and I am proud that she works for the BBC.“I have asked the editorial and leadership teams to discuss how we manage live exchanges on air around these topics in the future. Our impartiality is fundamental to our journalism and is what our audiences expect of us.”The U-turn is an embarrassment for David Jordan, head of editorial standards at the BBC, who gave interviews last week defending the decision to find against Ms Munchetty.The offending conversation took place in July, in response to a tweet by Mr Trump telling four US Congresswomen of colour to “go back” to the “broken and crime infested places from which they came”. All are US citizens.Mr Walker first asked Ms Munchetty about her own experiences of being told to “go home”, which she said was a sentiment “embedded in racism”.He then said Mr Trump’s use of the language “feels like a thought-out strategy to strengthen his position”. Munchetty ended the discussion by saying: “Anyway, look, I’m not here to give my opinion.”BBC staff signed letters in support of Ms Munchetty, and prominent black Britons wrote an open letter calling for the decision to be overturned. Critics included Sajid Javid, the Chancellor, who tweeted: “C’mon BBC. This is ridiculous. It’s perfectly understandable why she said what she did.”Further pressure was piled on yesterday when it emerged that both Ms Munchetty and Mr Walker were the subject of the original complaint.In interviews, Mr Jordan had twice insisted that only Ms Munchetty was reprimanded because “the simple fact is we haven’t had a complaint about Dan Walker’s role.”He failed to mentioned that the viewer originally railed against both presenters. A BBC source said the complainant only dropped an objection to Mr Walker when the complaint reached its final stages.In the original complaint, which was leaked to the , they called Mr Walker’s conduct “unprofessional” and said: “These two preseners have never made any secret of their left-wing and anti-Trump bias but usually in more subtle ways, such as eye-rolling and looks of exasperation when reporting on news stories…“If you are content for your supposedly impartial presenters to make biased political statements, just say so. If you are not, then my complaint should be upheld and words of advice given.”Living by the sea makes you happy, study findsBritain\u0026#39s pine marten population to double overnight in conservation effortTheresa May says she will never write a tell all book like David Cameron, but may do one on walkingTwo girls aged 14 and 16 arrested on suspicion of murdering 80-year-old found dead at homeAustralian PM Scott Morrison agreed to help Donald Trump with investigation into Russia probe originsJack Straw says he would think twice about voting for Labour under Jeremy Corbyn Violent offenders to serve two-thirds of jail sentences as automatic release at halfway point abolished\u0026#39Weak\u0026#39 evidence of cancer link from red and processed meat, major review concludesTate Modern\u0026#39s reimagining of Victoria Memorial is \u0026#39jab at Britannia\u0026#39, says artistExclusive picture: Tory MP Sir Desmond Swayne \u0026#39blacked up\u0026#39 as soul singer James BrownBoris Johnson to reveal his final Brexit plan to EU leaders within 24 hoursJackson Carlaw \u0026#39failed to inform\u0026#39 Scottish Tory Shadow Cabinet ahead of no deal Brexit u-turn Tech bosses could be held legally liable for harmful content, says Culture Secretary Nicky MorganFemale soldier responsible for arranging army travel fraudulently spent £17,000 on “jollies and holidays” for loved ones, court martial hearsNumber of obese people rescued by fire service tops 1,000 for the first timeFemale Isil supporter killed in row over makeshift Sharia court in Syrian campHow China\u0026#39s military parade will showcase a country seeking regional dominanceTown clock that chimes every 15 minutes throughout the night silenced after 120 years People should be able to build houses on the Green Belt if they win a local vote, housing minister saysWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons october 2019","story":"To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter -

The director\u0027s adaptation is a nonsensical, deeply convoluted disaster that wastes an enjoyably oddball cast. It\u0027s the only one of Lynch\u0027s films the director has publicly disowned. Still, hopes are high that next year’s version from Arrival director Denis Villeneuve, starring Timothée Chalamet and Zendaya, will somehow be better.  326 The Bonfire of the Vanities (1990)Fresh off the success of bestselling novel The Bonfire of the Vanities, Warner Bros bought the rights from Tom Wolfe for a staggering $750,000. Tom Hanks and Melanie Griffiths were both (mis)cast in the lead roles after director Brian De Palma\u0027s preferred choices turned him down. The filmmaker himself struggled to spin the 1990 production\u0027s many plates amid reports of rising on-set troubles that were all witnessed and documented in Julie Salmon\u0027s follow-up book, The Devil\u0027s Candy.1991 gangster film Billy Bathgate, which stars Dustin Hoffman and Nicole Kidman, did no justice to EL Doctorow\u0027s beloved 1989 novel. With the efforts of Oscar-winning Kramer vs Kramer director Robert Benton and a script by Tom Stoppard, the film had all the ingredients to become as good as The Godfather, Scarface, and Goodfellas. Instead, it was a hollow adaptation, largely because all the magic was lost with the absence of the central character\u0027s narration – a huge reason behind the novel\u0027s success.The Scarlet Letter (1995) is ranked as one of the worst book adaptations ever made and for good reason. Described by DH Lawrence as “a perfect work of the American imagination, the book was handed a Hollywood makeover that found itself the brunt of ridicule after flopping at the box office. Director Roland Joffé strayed so far from Nathaniel Hawthorne\u0027s pages that what should have been an enticing romance became an extremely throwaway erotic drama.  To be fair, few would be able to turn L Ron Hubbard’s allegedly Scientology-inspired Battlefield Earth (2000) into something decent. This John Travolta-with-dreadlocks epic has since gone down in “Worst Movies Ever” infamy, effectively ending Travolta’s mainstream movie career and destroying Barry Pepper’s before it even started.  Louis de Bernières\u0027s Captain Corelli\u0027s Mandolin was one of the biggest literary successes of the 1990s, but the 2001 film version – from the same British company that made Notting Hill – lost all traces of the novel\u0027s heart and soul. The dialogue is disastrous and lead stars Nicolas Cage (Captain Corelli) and Penélope Cruz (Pelagia) lack any chemistry. It may look pretty, but this adaptation was a complete mistake.  The beauty of HG Wells’s 1895 science fiction novella The Time Machine was lost amid all the CGI in this insipid 2002 adaptation, which was directed by Wells\u0027s great-grandson, Simon. Everything featured, including Guy Pearce\u0027s lead performance, is wooden apart from the copper time travel contraption at the heart of the story.There have been just as many disappointing Stephen King adaptations as there have been successful ones, but Dreamcatcher sits at the bottom of that list. The talent was present (Damian Lewis! Morgan Freeman! Timothy Olyphant!), but the end product never once correlates to anything at all decent. The film\u0027s late-stage swerve into monster movie territory is nothing short of dreadful.Before he took on the role of 007, Daniel Craig starred in this adaptation of Ian McEwan’s novel about people whose lives become entangled after witnessing a deadly accident. While Craig’s performance as college lecturer Joe, along with Rhys Ifans as Jed – the man who becomes obsessed with him – are convincing, the film allows little time for character development and suffers because of it.Nick Hornby adaptations don’t inherently need to be set in the UK (the John Cusack-starring High Fidelity, if you like that sort of thing, is something of a classic, after all), but they do need to translate the fussy, infuriating male neuroses of his novels. The Perfect Catch is the 2005 US adaptation of Hornby’s Fever Pitch, released a decade after Colin Firth starred in his own British adaptation, and transforms the source material into a more throwaway and uninteresting big-city romcom. Drew Barrymore, in a \u0027girlfriend’ role significantly beefed up in comparison to Hornby’s novel, is great, but watching her try and source chemistry with a shrill and unappealing Jimmy Fallon (in one of his rare, pre-talk show acting roles) is harrowing.The Da Vinci Code is a stinker of the highest order. Its sequels, Angels \u0026amp Demons (2009) and Inferno (2016), are also awful films, but the reason the initial Dan Brown adaptation ranks as the worst is because the others wouldn\u0027t have existed had this one not been so successful.20th Century Fox clearly wanted Eragon to be their answer to Harry Potter, but the terrible reviews stopped that plan dead in its tracks. Eragon is the worst kind of fantasy adaptation – one where all of the source materials\u0027 sense of fantastical vibrancy disappears during its translation to the big screen.1426 Running with Scissors (2006)Augusten Burroughs’s Running with Scissors consistently walks a dangerous tightrope between manic farce and adolescent horror tale. Ryan Murphy’s adaptation, released in 2006, collapses beneath such a task. You can see why Murphy, for his feature film debut, would be attracted to a tale of neurotic family dysfunction and sexual awakening as they are themes that crop up in many of his TV shows (Glee, American Horror Story, etc). But this adaptation is a tonal misfire from start to finish, despite the best efforts of an all-star cast that includes Annette Bening, Gwyneth Paltrow, Evan Rachel Wood and Brian Cox. It’s no wonder this sunk without a trace. In another case of Hollywood throwing money at something in the belief that will be enough, Philip Pullman’s superb His Dark Materials trilogy – or rather, the first book Northern Lights – was condensed into an agonising mess of CGI and hammy acting in 2007\u0027s The Golden Compass. Much of the blame went to the fact that Hollywood, where God is thanked above anyone else at the Oscars, would likely be uncomfortable handling material that was so critical of the Catholic church. It also suffered by trying to condense an overwhelming amount of information into the opening few scenes. A forthcoming BBC adaptation starring James McAvoy and Lin-Manuel Miranda looks far more promising.Where to start with this disaster of a film? Audrey Niffenegger’s The Time Traveller\u0027s Wife is beautifully and convincingly written, but there\u0027s nothing convincing about its adaptation. Producers thought casting two major Hollywood stars was a good idea, but Rachel McAdams and Eric Bana had zero chemistry. Cloud Atlas (2012) is by no means a disaster, but it\u0027s meandering plot lines, sketchy pacing and often questionable acting (Hanks has never been dodgier) do David Mitchell\u0027s sprawling, inventive novel a disservice. Still, it\u0027s an enjoyable Wachowskis romp that features Hugh Grant as a cannibal tribesman, so it has that going for it.Fans of The Hobbit did not expect the novel, so short and sweet and set in such a familiar and adored world, to be messed up by The Lord of the Rings maestro Peter Jackson – but that’s exactly what happened. While the trilogy of Hobbit films were a box-office success, they came under fire from critics for stretching the book\u0027s material too thin. Third outing, The Battle of Five Armies, was the worst received of all three.  The film adaptation of the profoundly moving and dark tale The Book Thief, which follows a young girl in Nazi Germany, is tonally off from the first scene. The glossy cinematography and excessively sentimental score jar with its grim subject matter and the performances verge on caricature. It doesn\u0027t help that all of the English dialogue is spoken with a German accent.No adaptation of The Great Gatsby,  F Scott Fitzgerald’s most famous work, has managed to capture the excess, glamour and underlying sleaze of the roaring Twenties. Baz Luhrmann\u0027s 2013 version was fun and arguably the best at revealing the insecurities of (a brilliant) Leonardo DiCaprio’s Gatsby. However, the flashiness of the production stripped away all of Fitzgerald’s delicate story-telling.Disgraced producer Harvey Weinstein’s fingerprints are all over this messy adaptation of Young Adult novel The Giver (2014), which attempts to fuse a sincere, thoughtful allegory with a Twilight-style love story backed up by action fresh from The Hunger Games  and a Taylor Swift cameo. By attempting to appeal to every single teenager all at once, though, The Giver loses sight of its fascinating dystopian premise and gives its eccentric cast (among them Jeff Bridges, Meryl Streep, Alexander Skarsgård and Katie Holmes) very little to do.  John Niven\u0027s Kill Your Friends is a blistering, debauched exploration into the life of a cocaine-sniffing record label agent. It passes by in the blink of an eye, which can\u0027t be said for its adaptation. The film, released in 2015, tries so hard to nail what Niven achieves so fluidly and it shows – the result is nothing short of embarrassing with the clean-cut Nicholas Hoult failing to convince as the sociopathic Steven Stelfox.2326 The Girl on the Train (2016)Although it will always exist in the shadow of Gillian Flynn’s ingenious thriller Gone Girl, The Girl on the Train is an undeniably pacy and intelligent novel. But it was completely let down by this US film adaptation. The 2016 release, starring Emily Blunt, is cheesy and lacking in nuance – and criminally takes the story away from its original gritty London setting, plonking the characters down in glossy New York for no apparent reason. The 2016 adaptation of Me Before You, starring Emilia Clarke and Sam Claflin, was brutally panned by critics for being emotionally manipulative. Its bad acting and problematic premise didn\u0027t help, either. Clarke\u0027s performance as the paid companion to Claflin’s quadriplegic was in particular criticised for being offensively exaggerated.  While not the same calibre of flop as Dreamcatcher, The Dark Tower is a fine example of a botched attempt at adapting one of Stephen King\u0027s finest works. With Idris Elba and Matthew McConaughey in the lead roles as the heroic and villainous characters caught in a fated tussle, it should have soared – but a rush job such as Nikolaj Arcel\u0027s 2017 film is no way to treat such an expansive piece of work. Despite magnetic performances from Saoirse Ronan and Billy Howle, this adaptation of Ian McEwan\u0027s On Chesil Beach was weighed down by a turgid script and clumsy old-age make-up. The finished product is worlds away from the McEwan adaptation that Ronan previously starred in –\u0026nbspthe Oscar-winning drama Atonement (2007).Dune was never going to be an easy book to turn into a two-hour action movie – and David Lynch’s attempt is proof that it should be best left alone.

John Niven\u0027s Kill Your Friends is a blistering, debauched exploration into the life of a cocaine-sniffing record label agent. It passes by in the blink of an eye, which can\u0027t be said for its adaptation. The film, released in 2015, tries so hard to nail what Niven achieves so fluidly and it shows – the result is nothing short of embarrassing with the clean-cut Nicholas Hoult failing to convince as the sociopathic Steven Stelfox.2326 The Girl on the Train (2016)Although it will always exist in the shadow of Gillian Flynn’s ingenious thriller Gone Girl, The Girl on the Train is an undeniably pacy and intelligent novel. But it was completely let down by this US film adaptation. The 2016 release, starring Emily Blunt, is cheesy and lacking in nuance – and criminally takes the story away from its original gritty London setting, plonking the characters down in glossy New York for no apparent reason. The 2016 adaptation of Me Before You, starring Emilia Clarke and Sam Claflin, was brutally panned by critics for being emotionally manipulative. Its bad acting and problematic premise didn\u0027t help, either. Clarke\u0027s performance as the paid companion to Claflin’s quadriplegic was in particular criticised for being offensively exaggerated.  While not the same calibre of flop as Dreamcatcher, The Dark Tower is a fine example of a botched attempt at adapting one of Stephen King\u0027s finest works. With Idris Elba and Matthew McConaughey in the lead roles as the heroic and villainous characters caught in a fated tussle, it should have soared – but a rush job such as Nikolaj Arcel\u0027s 2017 film is no way to treat such an expansive piece of work. Despite magnetic performances from Saoirse Ronan and Billy Howle, this adaptation of Ian McEwan\u0027s On Chesil Beach was weighed down by a turgid script and clumsy old-age make-up. The finished product is worlds away from the McEwan adaptation that Ronan previously starred in –\u0026nbspthe Oscar-winning drama Atonement (2007).Later, he asks a waitress if the orange juice is freshly squeezed, “like, right out of the orange? Can I bother you for a tiny sample?” Journalist Ellie Austin observes that he “swirls and sniffs” the juice “as if tasting an expensive Merlot” before announcing: “it’s a no from me.”Discussing his Instagram account and a series of topless selfies he posted to his 10 million followers earlier this year, Elgort apparently produced his phone and began to discreetly take photos of Austin, who asks him to stop.\u0026nbspWhy literary bestsellers like The Goldfinch rarely make decent moviesThe Goldfinch review: A disastrous translation of Donna Tartt’s book The Goldfinch on course to be one of biggest flops in cinema history“See, you got shy, but I’m capturing the moment,” Elgort says. “It’s a nice image. You look surreal. Your hair is done in a way that is both put-together and relaxed. Your earrings are artistic and tasteful. Your dress looks like a mother’s, so people feel comfortable. You seem sophisticated.”Austin later tweeted the online version of the interview and said it was “bonkers”.

This is currently under investigation however, we would advise that you try reconnecting at regular intervals. Apologies for any inconvenience, NatWest said on Twitter in response to complaints.A spokesperson for the bank said the mobile Bankline app is unaffected.The outage follows another incident with the app on Thursday, which showed some customers other firms\u0027 accounts when they logged in with their own details. The problem has been resolved.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe issues are the latest in a string of IT problems for NatWest\u0026nbspand its parent Royal Bank of Scotland. Last month, both bank\u0027s websites went down on the same day, leaving users unable to manage their accounts online, although the lenders said their mobile apps were still working.But IT troubles are not confined to those\u0026nbsptwo banks.Figures from the Financial Conduct Authority show UK\u0026nbspbanks suffered more than one IT shutdown each and every month in 2018, including a nine-month period when Barclays had 41 blackouts and Lloyds 37.\u0026nbspThese outages can have a long-term impact on customers. For example, scheduled payments may not go through or, if consumers can’t access their accounts to make payments, that can have a negative impact on their credit report. This can damage their ability to be accepted for financial products in future, like a mobile phone contract or even a mortgage. It could mean they only have access to higher interest rates, which increases the cost of credit.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

For example, scheduled payments may not go through or, if consumers can’t access their accounts to make payments, that can have a negative impact on their credit report. This can damage their ability to be accepted for financial products in future, like a mobile phone contract or even a mortgage. It could mean they only have access to higher interest rates, which increases the cost of credit.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

A few are genuinely upset, but only because they have mistaken their bid to reverse or ­neuter Brexit for a noble cause.It is not. Not after you have voted for a binding referendum, promised repeatedly to enact it and put the result in law.Boris calls it a “betrayal” because it is.He calls the rogue Act forcing him to beg another delay from the EU on their terms a “surrender” because it is.No, Yvette Cooper, his words are not “designed to escalate ision and hatred”. They accurately describe hugely powerful emotions, justiably felt by millions of Leavers and brought on by those politicians blocking Brexit.In  these Remainers could have accepted defeat, as others did.

If I get my sight back I’ll never wear contacts again.As well as infections, contact lens wearers need to watch out for lenses going missing — in their eyes.Last year, one Dundee woman found shed had a contact lens stuck behind her eye for  years without realising.The unnamed -year-old went to her GP when her upper left eyelid became droopy and swollen.An MRI revealed she had a cyst, which was identied as a rigid gas permeablecontact lens lodged behind the eyelid.The woman had been hit in the eye with a shuttlecock during a game of badminton when she was .She looked for the lens at the time but couldnt find it, and assumed it had been knocked out and lost.The lens was only found by stunned surgeons during an operation to remove the cyst from her eye.Publishing the astonishing find in the British Medical Journal, Dr Sirjhun Patel and colleagues wrote: During surgery, an encapsulated cyst was found.On removal, the cyst ruptured and a hard contact lens was extracted.Make sure you always:And make sure you never:Source: NHSAnd some cases of missing contact lenses are just baffling — and revolting.In , doctors found not one, but  contact lenses stuck in the eye of a forgetful patient.Perplexed medics made the disgusting discovery while preparing a -year-old woman for a routine cataract operation.They spotted a blueish mass in the patients eye which, one closer inspection, was  lenses stuck together with eye mucus.Another  lenses were separately found in the womans eye.Speaking with Optometry Today at the time, ophthalmologist Rupal Marjaria who dealt with the case said: None of us have ever seen this before.It was such a large mass. All the  contact lenses were stuck together.We were really surprised that the patient didnt notice it because it would cause quite a lot irritation while it was sitting there.As well as prescription lenses, novelty fancy dress contacts can also pose a danger.An -year-old Canadian girl went blind for four days last year after wearing coloured contact lenses while trick-or-treating last Halloween.Emilie Turcotte woke up screaming in pain the morning after as her eyes were burning like fire.She was rushed to the hospital where doctors treated her blood red eyes while she couldnt see anything for four days.They eventually discharged her and ordered Emilie to wear sunglasses for a month to let her damaged corneas heal.Her mum, Julie, told the Montreal Journal: For four days we were so scared. She could not see anything.All that for Halloween contact lenses.With Halloween just over a month away, experts are now warning party-goers about the dangers of novelty contact lenses this year too.According to Feel Good Contacts, lenses should only be worntheyre a prescription from a qualied optician and its illegal for them to be sold where.Ashish Marthur, Eye Care Expert at Feel Good Contacts said: It is advisable that you avoid buying them from street vendors, salons, beauty supply stores, boutiques, flea markets, novelty stores, Halloween stores, convenience stores or untrustworthy internet sellers."},{"url":null,"title":"demi moore one drama to another","story":"One of the many revelations was about her knickers being exposed on social media in a photo taken by her then husband Ashton Kutcher, who is said to be not best pleased about how he is portrayed in the book, Inside Out.I’m not sure Demi fully realised the impact of her “warts-and-all” memoirs, including claims that Kutcher — her much younger third husband — cheated on her and instigated “threesomes”.He’s moved on, now has a ­family with we Mila Kunis and knows that one day his two kids will read all about his behaviour during his ­marriage to Demi and find it highly embarrassing.She saw the actor,  years her ­junior, as a way to press the restart button and relive her youth all over again, but this time with a chance ofhappiness. It wasn’t to be.I first noticed Demi in , when she appeared in the movie Ghost, as fresh-faced, husky-voiced Molly, mourning the death of her husband Sam, played by Patrick Swayze.She looked adorable, with elfin cropped hair, little make-up and denim dungarees.Everyone wanted to look like this particularly gorgeous “girl next door” and that role catapulted her on to Hollywood’s A-list.Demi made a string of successful but rather questionable movies including Indecent Proposal, Striptease and GI Jane and demanded such high fees she was dubbed “Gimme Moore”, the sort of snarky comment that would never be made about a male actor.Her marriage to Bruce Willis made them the Brad and Angelina of their day, but just like that relationship, theirs too ended in tears and failure.Demi and Bruce went on to declare a truce and he was even at the launch of her new book in a show of support — although you do have to wonderhe had actually read what his ex had written about him.She claims that at the height of her fame he wanted her out of Hollywood so she could be a stay-at-home mum for their children.What strikes me about Demi’s story — from her being raped as a vulnerable  year old, to her complete ­mental breakdown after her marriage to Kutcher fell apart — was what a deeply unhappy le she has led.I honestly don’t know how any young girl would recover from being raped by a disgusting pervert who she claims “bought her” for a few hundred dollars from her alcoholic mother.How on Earth are you supposed to deal with such a horric betrayal from the one person who is supposed to love and protect you from harm It is very sad that Demi said she always felt that she was to blame for the appalling ordeal inflicted upon her by her mother and a man old enough to be her father.I think deep down she’s still that frightened, betrayed little girl who never thinks she is quite good enough.Demi writes movingly about being desperate to have a child with Kutcher.Shortly after their marriage she became pregnant, but tragically the baby died when she was six months pregnant.Again she blamed herself for the loss, and started drinking heavily.The relationship never really recovered. Years later ,just before the couple split, I interviewed Kutcher and it wasn’t a happy experience for all concerned.He wasn’t unpleasant, just deeply uncomfortable and clearly didn’t want to be promoting his latest project, but it was in his contract to so do.Everyone that day received monosyllabic replies and it was no surprise when the news broke shortly afterwards that his marriage to Demi had crumbled and that was when she started to really unravel.Even though on the outside Demi appeared to have everything — fame, enormous wealth, three healthy children and a handsome actor on her arm — inside she was a mass of ­anxiety and insecurities as she lurched from one crisis to the next.She came close to death a year after the split while partying with her oldest daughter Rumer. Demi suffered a seizure after taking drugs and inhaling nitrous oxide.That was a wake-up call for her to seek help and get her act together. Writing the book is apparently all part of the healing process.It won’t have been an easy read for her three grown-up daughters who, unsurprisingly, have apparently had their own issues with either substance abuse or insecurity about their bodies.I honestly do wonderanyone in Hollywood, especially those who find fame because of their good looks and winning smiles, are living happy, ­contented and fulfilled lives.It doesn’t look like it, and it’s deeply sad that a seemingly confident, extremely beautul woman such as Demi should have felt so worthless.All credit to her for coming back from the brink and having the guts to tell her story in her own words.But there is always collateral damage when you decide to be so honest, and I hope she is strong enough to weather the inevitable storms gathering on the horizon.Harry and Meghan brought out a secret weapon during their visit to South Africa and instantly blew away all the negativity and criticism they have experienced this year.With one cute smile and a whole lot of gurgles, baby Archie has completely rehabilitated his parents and shown them in a much happier and far more positive light.It is the first time we have properly seen the four month old and you do wonder why they haven’t shown him to the world before now.Everybody loves a baby, and Archie is a poppet, as well as being Harry’s absolute double.He has a sunny disposition and is obviously adored by his besotted mum and dad. The wee chap looked delighted to be on his first proper outing as a member of the royal firm.And Meghan is in her element. She appeared happy, relaxed and has managed to get her “look” just right.There were no designer frocks nor ostentatious jewellery. Instead it was all sustainable dresses, High Street shoes and lots of recycled outfits.Harry and Meghan have both shone a light on some hugely deserving causes and charities close to their hearts.They work well together, as well as being effective on their own, and it’s refreshing to hear them speak to the media like normal people, instead of the usual dry, formal speeches.It is in places such as Africa that they can both do such a lot of good and build on the pioneering charity work carried out by Harry’s late mum Princess Diana.Meghan telling young South African girls she is a woman of colour who feels like their sister means they can truly relate to her. The words were inspired and from the heart.There are rumours that in the future Harry, Meghan and Archie would spend half the year in southern Africa, and I reckon it’s a good idea.I’ve been lucky enough to visit this incredible part all of the world and it grabs you by the heart and doesn’t let go.Like Harry, I share a particular love of beautul Botswana, and would be delighted for themthey were lucky enough to set up a home from home there.They would be under much less pressure and scrutiny than here in the UK and able to lead almost normal lives should they so wish.Meanwhile Harry, Meghan – and especially Archie – continue with the charm offensive, breaking down barriers and becoming a force to be reckoned with.Diana would be very proud.Recycle your clothes instead of having wardrobes stuffed with cheap fashion.Stop buying plastic-wrapped fast food and maybe think about turning the bloody lights off when you leave a room.Just a thought . . .I HONESTLY think we are in imminent danger of completely losing our sense of humour and turning into a nation of po-faced bores.I couldn’t believe the reaction I got when I cheekily asked smouldering actor Jason Isaacshe was wearing shorts in an upcoming charity run for Great Ormond Street Hospital, and that I would happily run behind him for the view.It was a cheeky remark made to a delightfully naughty man, who I have interviewed many times.I knew he wouldn’t be offended in the least but would laugh heartily, which is exactly what happened. I also thought it was a fun way to promote a terric cause.I was astonished to be labelled “sexist” and “inappropriate”, which is completely OTT for such innocuous remarks.People really need to get things into perspective.Dan has brought us some of the top names in TV, movies and music, covered all the big award ceremonies and always delivers the most entertaining gossip.Here’s to the next decade of scoops, scandals and showbiz shenanigans.  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Beyonce has been involved in a trade-mark dispute for years against Wendy Morales, whose wedding planning business goes by the same name.Beyonce is outraged at the idea that Blue Ivy Carter, “the daughter of two of the most famous performers in the world”, might be confused with a boutique wedding event planning business.Which is unlikely, when you really think about it.So you might wonder why — really — Beyonce gives a flying fig about the fact that it has the same name as her daughter.But I guess — unless you are the mother of a cultural icon — it’s hard for mere mortals like us to understand.Beyonce has accused Morales of riding her coattails. Who knows, maybe she is. But so what What seems more relevant is the degree to which these parents apparently view their daughter as an extension of themselves.They care more about their fame and reputation than they do about letting Blue Ivy forge her own path, find her own identity and be herself.Yes, we all pass on our values and, to a degree, our aspirations to our children.But we all owe it to our kids to be aware of where we stop and they begin.And it seems to me that Beyonce and Jay Z are robbing their daughter of her childhood and suffocating her with their own aspirations.We only have to take one look around at those who haven’t been allowed proper childhoods — Michael Jackson, Macaulay Culkin, Aaron Carter — to see how badly things can go wrong.Forget designer clothes and cultural icon status, the best thing Blue Ivy’s parents could give her is a proper childhood.We all think our kids are special. Most of us do our best NOT to spoil our kids and keep them grounded, they seem to want the opposite.They need to teach her that money and status is not as important as family, values, morals, kindness — and friends. THIS week I am mainly feeling fed up with politicians.I voted Remain because the chaos of leaving far outweighed any problems of staying in.But the country voted Leave and I accepted that. What’s the point in asking the country to votethe result is ignored Three years on and we are still waiting to leave. Boris Johnson is at least trying to honour the people’s decision.Jo Swinson for the Lib Debs, who is held up as a shining new light in politics, has said thather party wins an election – most unlikely – she will cancel Brexit on the basis that on the first vote the margin for Leave was so small and people didn’t know what they were voting for.But those are just excuses. She, and others, think they know best and would no doubt keep having the vote until they get the result they want – to remain in Europe.Politicians are trying to force a Remain outcome, through delays to Brexit, not calling a general election and following their own views on the EU rather than that of the country.But crashing out without a deal is not what really worries me. It’s the prospect of a Jeremy Corbyn government.Here is a man who sympathises with Russia – although they came here and killed people, including poisoning a police officer.A man who sympathises with the IRA, met with Hamas and Hezbollah and refused to sing the National Anthem.A man who wants to close private schools and implement a four-day week .This is a man who wants to introduce a right-to-buy scheme for private tenants and force landlords to sell their buy-to-rent properties for less than they are worth, leaving them in debt – then also clobber them with higher taxes.He wants to nationalise industry and confiscate £billion of shares in , large companies and hand them to workers.As Margaret Thatcher said, the problem with socialism is you eventually run out of other people’s money.I hope politicians knock their heads together, compromise, get out of Europe and focus on the future outside of the EU – new trade deals, new investments, jobs and innovation.This is a great country, let’s hope it remains so.I KNOW Phoebe Waller- Bridge is not for everyone – although her telly show Fleabag is pretty damned funny.But whether you like her or not, she is currently on a serious roll.TV awards left, right and centre including Emmys and Baftas – and now she has just signed a £million deal with Amazon.Her talent is incredible.IN her new memoirs, Demi Moore has criticised ex-husband Ashton Kutcher for “shaming” her by sharing a picture of her in her underwear during their marriage.Apparently, he justied it at the time by saying that sharing a snap of Demi half-naked was just a “good-natured joke”.Really ACTOR Christopher Eccleston has revealed his lelong battle with anorexia – which some, who think of it as a woman’s affliction, may have found shocking.Meanwhile, F’s Lewis Hamilton has revealed he’s not happy with his body and has clearly spent his letime trying to become so.Both stories are reminders that men are becoming as fixated with their physiques as women have been all these years.What we are left with is a reality that no one – man or woman – is ever -per-cent happy with their looks.I most certainly am not.THIS Wednesday sees theof The Apprentice at pm on BBC .The show starts with a bang when Lord Sugar sends candidates off to South Africa to run a safari tour.When they don’t know the dference between an elephant and a rhino, you know it spells disaster . . .  but in a good way.This series is the best ever, so I hope you watch it and enjoy it as much as we did making it.Freddy McConnell, , from Kent, wants to be registered as “father” or “parent”, despite having physically given birth to the baby – but a judge ruled against him.This is tricky, but the judge’s decision has to be the right one. Despite the wonders of modern science, men cannot, yet, give birth.That’s a fact.He was physically a woman when he gave birth and, although he may be legally male now, that’s another issue.WHATEVER Christie Brinkley is doing, she looks fantastic for .As she posed in a denim jumpsuit, looking decades younger she left me thinking I would love to know what she’s had done – as I would certainly do it.She obviously eats well and exercises – but she has also had surgery, which she is very honest about.Others have had it and look strange, but Christie looks fresh and youthful. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

If the family will accept it, we would very much like the opportunity to donate to the charity they have established.As importantly, we join with the Udell family in calling for legislation regarding mandatory background checks across the retail industry and any other reasonable steps that can be taken to ensure this kind of tragedy does not occur again.It added: Specic to our own practices, background checks have long been required by Best Buy and we are working with those we contract out to ensure that these checks are up-to-date and are done on a re-occurring basis.Additionally, we continue to work with an independent security firm to review the practices of all third parties that we hire to do work on our behalf in customers homes.JB Hunt said it could not comment on the pending legal action but said in a statement it offered our deepest condolences to the family and friends of the woman whose le was senselessly lost following an August  delivery in Boca Raton."},{"url":null,"title":"china set to unveil dongfeng 41 nuke that can strike us in 30 minutes at 70th anniverary parade","story":"The super-nuke is expected to take centre stage at a huge arms showcase held in Tiananmen Square, Beijing, to mark  years of Communist rule.The Dongfeng-, is a , mph intercontinental ballistic missile that is said to have the furthest range of any nuclear missile and could reach the US in  minutes.Speculation has been re as to what weapons will be unveiled, with parade rehearsals showing missiles and aircraft under camouflage wraps.The Chinese government is keen to assert its dominance in Asia and particularly in the South China Sea where it has been busy building militarised islands in international waters.And its clear message to the US is that it is getting closer than ever to matching it in terms of military might.A defence ministry spokesman recently said Beijing had no intention to flex its muscles but was instead keen to show a peace-loving and responsible China.The high-profile parade will include , troops, more than  aircraft and  pieces of military equipment, according to Ministry of Defence spokesman Major General Cai Zhijun.A supersonic drone, hypersonic missile and a robot submarine could all be shown off.But all eyes will be primed for whether the huge Dongfeng missile rolls through Tiananmen Square in what would be its debut public appearance.Many new weapons “will be shown for the first time,” Cai told reporters last week. Asked whether that would include the DF-, Cai said, “Please wait and see.”No details of the DF- have been released, but the Centre for Strategic and International Studies in Washington said it may have the world’s longest range at , kilometres.US nuclear tipped missiles fall a few thousand kilometres short of that.Analysts say the DF-, flying at  times the speed of sound, might be able to reach the US in  minutes with up to  warheads for separate targets.China’s current mainstay missile the Dongfeng- — Dongfeng means “east wind” — has a range of more than , kilometres that puts most of the continental US within reach.A version of this story originally appeared on news.au.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Nearly  rangers were gunned down by poachers between  and .Local poachers hunt wildle - like leopards, lions or monkeys - then deliver carcasses to ‘fronts’ owned by international crime syndicates and with links to Jihadis.Rhino horn can be more valuable on the black markets than cocaine or heroin, making the exotic animal trade the fourth most lucrative illegal activity in the world behind drugs, arms and human trafficking.Malawis poverty and corruption has made it South Africas number one trafficking route for ivory trafficking.Yet, despite massive efforts and UK funds being pumped in, no foreign national has been convicted in Malawi.From the killing fields of Zambia and Mozambique to the traffickers streaming through Malawi, we lt the lid on the illegal wildle trade which remains one of the most brutal industries in the world...The huge sums of money at stake have made poaching a lucrative trade for criminal organisations and terrorist groups.Poachers linked to the Jihadi group Boko Haram are believed to have slaughtered , forest elephants in a single region of Gabon over  years – leading to the deployment of British troops to the region in .Shocking images of a mutilated elephant corpse show sick poachers often cut the animals head in half to remove its tusks.Other elephants and lions have ended up maimed by metal traps laid out by poachers.Lions have become a target recently because so many rhinos have been wiped out and the big cats are easier to poach because they scavenge which means poachers can poison them with meat before hacking off their faces and paws.“If you take out the word wildle and think about it in terms of crime and its value to a country, these resources – be it for tourism or whatever – are being lost,” says Mary Rice, executive director of the Environmental Investigation Agency.“It’s a hugely serious criminal activity and it’s highly likely that some of these iniduals are involved in other trades, like firearms and money laundering. It’s all interlinked.”As well as being barbaric, the poaching trade is forcing many species towards extinction.Over the last  years the global number of black rhinos has dropped from , to ,, while the African Rhino could disappear by .Scaly anteaters called Pangolins are the world’s most trafficked mammal because of their hides and meat, and are particularly vulnerable as they curl into a ball when threatened.Over the last  years alone a million have been taken from the wild - in another  they could be completely gone.After the animals have been murdered, their hides and bones are cut into small bits, put in containers and moved through neighbouring countries where border police have been paid off. This is known as ‘owning the road’.Eventually, they make their way across continents to Asia, where there is a high demand in countries like China and Vietnam for ivory goods, furs and ornaments. Ivory is even ground into a powder then sold as Chinese medicine.Harry, Prince William and Prince Charles led an international wildle conference in  to highlight the problem of poaching, with Charles warning there wasnt a moment to lose when it came to protecting endangered animals.It led to the total ban on trading ivory in the UK - regardless of its age - last year, while in Malawi the government also toughened up laws.Five years ago, the average punishment for poaching in Malawi was a £ fine – in  it was a five-year jail term.The country has also pumped money into new investigation units, in part thank to UK funding, leading it to become the ‘golden child’ of the conservation world.Javier Montano, from the UN Office of Drugs and Crime, says a multi-agency approach is critical.Wildle trafficking needs to be treated as a serious crime, he says. “We hope that Malawi’s strong efforts in addressing and combating illegal wildle trade to date are reflected in the courtrooms in the coming months.”And it seems that might be the sticking point.Malawi has been linked to record hauls in Singapore, China and Australia, but is yet to convict a single foreign national caught trafficking.In contrast, neighbouring Tanzania jailed four Chinese smugglers for  years for rhino smuggling.“What we’re seeing is they track down these syndicates and networks and they use the full force of the law to arrest them,” says Rice.“But then corruption creeps in. We see some of these iniduals who should be receiving strict sentences being let off with lenient penalties.Tens of thousands of elephants are being killed every year for their ivory tusks.The ivory is often carved into ornaments and jewellery – China is the biggest consumer market for such products.The ban on international trade was introduced in  by CITESafter years of unprecedented poaching.In the s, an estimated , elephants were being killed per year and up to % of herds were lost in some regions.The ban allowed some populations to recover, especially where elephants were adequately protected.But there has been an upsurge in poaching and illegal ivory trafficking in recent years, driven by increasing demand in Asia, which has led to steep declines in forest elephant numbers and some savannah elephant populations.Insufficient anti-poaching capacity, weak law enforcement and corruption undermine efforts to stop the poaching and trafficking in some countries.Source: WWFIts hoped this could change as the country awaits the sentencing of an alleged wildle trafficking ring led by notorious ivory kingpin Yun Hua Lin, .Ten Chinese Nationals and four people from Malawai have been charged with possessing rhino horn, ivory, pangolin, hippo teeth and firearms.We have capacity issues, but so far Malawi is becoming a safe home for wildle, Brighton Kumchedwa, director of the Department of National Parks.These arrests are now sending a strong message that we are no longer a playground for wildle trafficking.Rice agrees that country has in many ways become a success story, but warns nothing can be taken for granted.I think they still need that eye on the country to help the government, prosecutions and NGOs to help get beyond the corrupt elements, she explains.“So it’s a really good opportunity with Prince Harry visiting.He’s done a lot to help raise the profile in the country but it’s still really grappling with the problem.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He has become its human embodiment and has to be stopped.“We’re going to throw everything at bringing him down.”He faces an ambush as he speaks at the Tory conference in Manchester this week.Scottish Nationalists and Labour could table a confidence vote with the aim of installing a stand-in PM.Mr Corbyn still insists he should get first bite at leading a government of national unityMr Johnson is toppled.It comes after Mr Johnson was denied a recess to hold the conference as opposition parties claimed it was too soon after his Parliament shutdown.MPs ed to the chamber  last week after the PM’s suspension of Parliament - originally meant to be five weeks - was ruled to be unlawful by  Supreme Court judges.The case had been brought to the highest court in the land in a legal challenge by Remainer lawyer Gina Miller and former Tory PM, Sir John Major.Mr Johnson had argued that he suspended Parliament to push through a new domestic legislative agenda with a Queens Speech.But Remainer MPs said it was to avoid scrutiny over his Brexit plans - in particular No Deal.A humble address is a direct call from the House of Commons to the Sovereign to request the government produce documents.According Parliamentary Practice, a rulebook published in the th Century, the humble address is more binding than a simple opposition motion.That is because it is an appeal to the head of state, rather than to the government who could otherwise choose to ignore it.Speaker of the House John Bercow said such motions were “traditionally regarded as binding or effective”.It was used by Labour in November  to force the government to publish  studies on Brexit.The research had been commissioned for ministers who had fiercely opposed them being made public — leading opponents to believe they may contain information embarrassing to the government."},{"url":null,"title":"theresa may regrets pm brexit","story":"Speaking for the first time since she stepped down as PM in July, the Maidenhead MP said yesterday she only wished her parents, who died when she was in her s, could have lived to see her get the top job.Asked about whether she had regrets of her time in office, Mrs May, , told an audience at the Henley Literature Festival: No I dont think so.

Five minutes, max, and that was me done.Then the Channel  continuity woman announced: “Richard Madeley’s going in”, and that was effectively me for the next three weeks.Glued to a series called The Circle, which could scarcely be a bigger waste of my own and everyone ’s time.As wastes of time go, though, this one’s pretty much unbeatable.It’s got a good host, for starters, Emma Willis, who has that happy knack of improving every show she guest-presents or, in this case, takes over from Maya Jama and Alice Levine.Emma, of course, hosted another famous Channel  reality show, which, above and beyond the fact the network has sold this format across the world, is the real reason it is so idiotically excited about The Circle.Finally, nine years after junking the show, it has a viable replacement for Big Brother and all that comes with it.A large building, nominations, evictions and a lot of bone-brained contestants who can message each other, inside The Circle, but never meet, meaning they are free to be whoever they want to be.Among those competing to win £,, we’ve got cat-fishing Scouser James, who’s pretending to be a single mum called Sammieand Katie, who’s taken on the identity of her own son, Jay.Hardly ambitious.The sheer effort of the pretence, though, means the most interesting contestants tend to be the ones who are just being themselves and come with a iety of sob stories and boasts, like “Crohn’s survivor” Georgina bisexual dyslexic Woody, who cannot wait to tell everyone he’s Zoe Ball and Norman Cook’s son and Brooke who refers to her breasts as “the goodies”, because they’re the exact same size as Bill Oddie’s head.Smartest and most interesting of the lot, however, is theology professor Tim, who’s keen to foster the idea he looks uncannily like Robin Williams, presumably to distract attention from the fact he looks uncannily like Harold Shipman. Which may also be the reason they didn’t stick Judy Finnigan in that house. Bad visuals.You already know who the real star is, though. It’s Madeley, who entered the show, babbling like a madman, day one, with an acoustic guitar and a keyboard.Deal was, he couldn’t win but had to take on a dferent identity.Richard fancied “an -year-old woman”but the viewers decided he should be a hot -year-old blonde called Judy.The results have been brilliant, not least ’cos Woody has flirted outrageously with “Judy” Richard, who’s had to respond in kind.It’s tinged with regret, though. The show where Richard Madeley really should be uniting a fractured nation in joy and laughter is Strictly.The Circle understands this only too well, so they had him togged up in a motion-capture avatar suit for an unforgettable game of “guess the dance” on Friday, moshing, dabbing and doing a tango that looked like Groucho Marx’s death stagger.“Forty years in journalism and broadcasting,” he sighed sarcastically, “And the pinnacle has arrived.”Yes, yes it finally has, Richard. Now seize the moment and get yourself on Strictly . A nation demands it.David Craig: “Jack Grealish does exactly what he says on the tin.”David Croft: “Vettel punched through a gap that wasn’t there.”And Matt Le Tissier: “I love scoring goals but equally almost liked creating goals as much.”BBC’S latest Far East celebrity travelogue really should’ve been called Sue Perkins Condescends To Meet Some Foreigners.But it wasn’t.

Everything’s driven by boundaries, rules and regulations. They’ve lost the fundamentals.”And then think: “Yeah, what this country really needs is a naked dating show where contestants are judged on the state of their genitals, hosted by Sue Perkins’ missus.”That’ll drag ’em into the st Century.The consistently brilliant Good Morning Britain finding the only Piers Morgan impersonator in Japan who wasn’t wearing a wrestling nappy.Richard Madeley’s cameo in The Circle.Celebrity MasterChef contestant Joey Essex inventing the “stirotto” , which looked about as appetising as a pandopsy .And Strictly’s Mike Bushell attempting the American smooth, with Katya Jones, to that all-time Glen Campbell classic Like A Blind Stoned Cowboy.AMERICAN trailer-trash comedian Vicki Barbolak accidentally locked herself in a pink caravan at the start of her routine on Britain’s Got Talent: The Champions.

The defendant was with a friend.Ciara Jones and Nicole Deadfield were sat together waiting for the train when they accidentally bumped into the defendant who started shouting at ‘do not f***ing bump into me.”Ms Lauchlan said that the victim had told the Ms Peereboom to put a stop to the argument as they all made their way onto the train but as it pulled into Reading station she allegedly launched an attack.The prosecutor said: As Ms Jones stood up she felt her hair pulled with enough force to pull her into a seat.“As people tried to get the defendant off her, the other victim had her hair pulled and received an injury to her ankle.”Gabriella Marabet, , who was a student at the time, said: I had drunk around a bottle of Prosecco and three gin and tonics at the Newbury races with my family and friends but I was tired after a long day of dancing and chatting and slept on the train ride to Reading station where we were set to change for Oxford.I went to swerve around a commotion in the alley when my hair was violently pulled forwards from the chair. I kicked out and my leg was grabbed by the same girl who had my hair.I was bitten just above the knee which felt like for ages but it was about  seconds long. I screamed and was escorted off the train and she was kept on it.The jury of nine women and three men was shown body-worn camera police footage of Ms Marabet and her family and friends on the  shouting after the incident.Ms Marabet said: I was furious, I was shouting that I had been bitten but I did not feel that it was dealt with accordingly by police officers at the time.When asked by defence counsel Kate Parker whether this commotion was the act of a sober person, the victim defended her actions blaming her anger and emotion on being upset that police treated her and her party as the culprit despite telling them she was the victim.Ms Lauchlan said: Ultimately, Gabriella Marabet was put in handcuffs and so was her step-brother and her party was warned they might be arrested. However, they were just detained until they calmed down.The jury was shown pictures taken by Ms Marabet of her bite injury the day after the incident.She said: I had a bite mark and a sore head from where my hair was pulled. I went to the doctors and I had to receive a Tetanus jab once a month for three months and a course of antibiotics.I have a scar now.

Andrea Leadsom had come under fire for not holding talks with Britainaposs oldest travel firm which went into liquidation seven days ago - despite the government knowing it was in financial trouble. Instead Ms Leadsom said it had been handled by the Transport Department and she did not want to get in the way. But, Ms Leadsom, said she had spoken frequently to the Transport Secretary Grant Shapps. I picked up the phone to Grant Shapps, who picked up the phone to Thomas Cook. So the point is you donapost want to have mixed messages, or too many cooks spoiling the broth, she told ITV News. It was really important that we were very clear. This was an enormous collapse. What we couldnapost have was one secretary of state saying aposis it going to collapse, and what time is it going to collapse apos. You could not possibly afford to have mixed messages.    So itaposs absolutely right that one secretary of state takes lead, and in the case of Thomas Cook that was the Department of Transport. Rebecca Long Bailey, Shadow Business Secretary accused the government of shirking its responsibility to Thomas Cook workers and supply chain businesses. She added: The message this sends out is that it doesnapost care about them, their families and the communities who will be hardest hit by the companyaposs demise. And ministers seem to care even less that company executives have pocketed multi million pound payouts while Thomas Cook sank further and further into debt, at the expense of , UK workers who have lost their jobs. Meanwhile hundreds and potentially thousands of workers for he company did not receive their salary today. Staff now face a tough fight against administrators to recoup their money for the lost hours worked in the run up to the firmaposs collapse.  General Secretary of the Transport Salaried Staffaposs Association Manuel Cortes has called for the Business Secretary to be sacked. Last week, the Business Select Committee launched an inquiry into the collapse, demanding company bosses appear before them to explain what went wrong. MPs intend to focus on executive pay and whether auditors did enough to hold bosses to account over their fondness for using one-off payments to flatter the underlying profits.

The PMaposs announcement of apos new hospitals’ will actually only deliver six unless the Tories win the next two elections. And it includes renovations of existing hospitals. The PM  claimed it was the “biggest hospital building programme in a generation.” But it will only deliver six new buildings or refurbs over the next five years. Theyaposll only promise the full they win not only the next election, but the one after that. When it comes to Mr Javidaposs commitments he is splashing the cash for roads, buses and broadband.  But the £bn pot for roads had already been set aside by his predecessor, Philip Hammond. The second Road Investment Strategy is for funding strategic roads between  and . Separately there is a £ million fund for buses which had also been announced earlier this month but which was renewed today.

The immortal “I don’t believe it!” uttered by actor Richard Wilson in the hit sit-com saw off meerkat Aleksandr Orlov’s “Simples” from the Compare the Market ad. Dad’s Army classic “Don’t panic” made famous by Lance-Corporal Jones, played by Clive Dunn was the third best loved. And Del Boy’smuch mimicked “Lovely jubbly” and “Rodney, you plonker!” from Only Fools and Horses both made the top .    The study found more than half of adults think the best expressions come from TV shows with one in five saying reality TV had the most popular catchphrases. According to the King’s College London study, on average Brits use a catchphrase three times a day and three in ten admit to peppering their conversations with well known phrases from their favourite shows. Experts say the perfect catchphrase is four words long, has to be heard at least four times to register in the brain and must be easy to repeat as well as funny.  The survey of , adults found a third of people use a popular phrase without knowing its origin with the pub the most likely place to drop it into general chit-chat. Tony Thorne, language consultant at King’s College university, said: “Catchphrases are a key component of popular culture as they connect the world of entertainment and consumption with the everyday concerns of real people - their feelings and experiences, their shared pleasures and their struggles and frustrations, and especially their triumphs over adversity. “Catchphrases derive their power from compressing complex ideas into short, snappy sequences.  “A catchphrase such as ‘I don’t believe it!’ expresses a mix of exasperation, world-weary resignation and fatalistic humour that will be familiar from many people’s personal experience.” The poll put “It is what it is” made famous by Love Island’s Sher Lanre, , just outside the top  at number  while The Daleks’ “Exterminate!” in Dr Who was at number  and comedian Micky Flanagan’s “We’re going out-out” made . .

The Loose Women star and the former Sky News paper reviewer revealed themselves at their most vulnerable in a bid to demonstrate to others suffering in silence that it really is OK not to be OK. Soundbites and campaigning on the issue are one thing. It is quite another to reveal the naked truth about just how weakened, dismantled and utterly defeated you are left feeling on a day to day basis. “How I describe it is the colour goes out of my le and people I am around that I love being with I don’t want to be around,” said Welch. Fty-year-old comedian Royce – a former warm-up man for The X Factor and Britain’s Got Talent – is fighting to overcome alcohol addiction. He suffered a brain aneurysm when drunk and at one time attempted suicide. “My name is Ian and I’m an alcoholic…holding my hands up… for help. There I said it and own it,” he posted on Twitter.

The girl-on-girl fracas happened on a train carrying revellers home from Newbury racecourse where they had been dancing and drinking. Today -year-old actress and dancer Eliza Peereboom sat in the dock accused of savagely biting a woman stranger above the knee so badly she has been left permanently scarred and needed three months of Tetanus injections. Peereboom, who lives in London, became involved in a fracas on the station  at Newbury, Berks., but physically beat other women who were in high spirits while travelling on the train to Reading, the court was told. The actress, who denies pulling the hair of racegoers Ciara Jones  and Nicole Deadfield and causing actual bodily harm to Gabriella Marabet, watched as a jury was shown  minutes of CCTV train footage from August  last year when the incident happened.  Prosecutor Emily Lauchlan opened the case saying: Everyone involved had been making their way home from Newbury racecourse. The defendant was with a friend. Ciara Jones and Nicole Deadfield were sat together waiting for the train when they accidentally bumped into the defendant who started shouting at aposdo not f***ing bump into meapos, said the prosecutor. Ms Lauchlan said that the victim had told the defendant to leave the problem on the  as they all made their way onto the train and the train ride was ultimately fine until the point when the train pulled into Reading station. As Ms Jones stood up she felt her hair pulled with enough force to pull her into a seat. As people tried to get the defendant off her, the other victim had her hair pulled and received an injury to her ankle, the jury at Reading Crown Court was told. Counts one and two of the indictment are ultimately hair pulling and bruising to the ankle, the prosecutor added. Judge Sarah Campbell then invited witness Gabriella Marabet, who was the person bitten, to take the witness stand. The jury heard that the -year-old victim now works at an estate agency but was studying business management and communications at university when the attack happened. Giving evidence she said: I had drunk around a bottle of Prosecco and three gin and tonics at the Newbury races with my family and friends but I was tired after a long day of dancing and chatting and slept on the train ride to Reading station where we were set to change for Oxford. I went to swerve around a commotion in the alley when my hair was violently pulled forwards from the chair. I kicked out and my leg was grabbed by the same girl who had my hair. I was bitten just above the knee which felt like for ages but it was about  seconds long. I screamed and was escorted off the train and she was kept on it.  The jury of nine women and three men was shown body-worn camera police footage of Ms Marabet and her family and friends on the  shouting and causing a commotion after the incident. Ms Marabet said: I was furious, I was shouting that I had been bitten but I did not feel that it was dealt with accordingly by police officers at the time. When asked by defence counsel Kate Parker whether this commotion was the act of a sober person, the victim defended her actions blaming her anger and emotion on being upset that police treated her and her party as the culprit despite telling them she was the victim.Ms Lauchlan said: Ultimately, Gabriella Marabet was put in handcuffs and so was her step-brother and her party was warned they might be arrested. However, they were just detained until they calmed down.

She signed up to Slimming World and, in  months, has lost more than  stone. The mother, of Tavistock, Devon, was told she could still eat all the food she loved, including chicken nuggets, and the weight started to drop off. Mandy realised the meal plan could easily be adapted to suit family le and she could eat everything from pizza, roast dinners, curry and even chicken nuggets and chips.    With the hundreds of free foods available it really can be adapted to any lestyle, the diabetes research nurse said. It really is so easy to follow as itaposs not a diet it is a well balanced healthy eating plan that encourages long term intrinsic lestyle changes. The best bit about Slimming World is nothing is banned. If I want to enjoy an ice cream on my day out with my little boy then I can. Slowly I kept swapping my food choices and increasing my physical activity and before I knew it I had easily embraced a whole new lestyle. My confidence was slowly building and I went from wanting to hide behind baggy clothes and  smiles to genuine happiness and clothes that showed off my new forming figure.    Mandy, who now weighs . stone, had struggled with her size since childhood. I was a chubby child and on the larger side as a teenager, she told Okehampton Times . As an emotional eater food has literally been my crutch and one that I have relied on heavily. As a teenager, I was subjected to bullying because of my weight and this only served to fuel my emotional eating and the weight slowly kept creeping on. Despite trying everything from hypnotherapy to diet pills, and milkshakes to restrictive diet plans, the mum found it tough to tackle the flab. She also had a setback when her husband was diagnosed with incurable kidney cancer. He was forced to have surgery to have his kidney removed, along with a separate operation for a hernia repair. And despite the pain of seeing her husband going through such a horric ordeal, her group managed to keep her on track with her diet.

Have a purpose in le The Japanese philosophy of ikigai roughly translates as “the reason you get up in the morning” and could add seven good years to your le, says explorer, author and longevity expert Dan Buettner.He adds: “Science has linked having a purposeful le with longer le ­expectancy, better sleep and lower rates of chronic illness. One of the most dangerous years of your le is the year you retire because you experience a sudden lack of purpose.” Have regular hot baths As well as helping to relax muscles, a Japanese study by Ehime University in Matsuyama found that regular hot baths are linked to better heart and circulatory health.Those who took at least five a week had lower markers of atherosclerosis . Eat like an Italian The Mediterranean diet is great for heart health, reduces the risk of diabetes, high blood pressure and cancer, and is ideal for sustainable fat burning and lean muscle gain, say scientists at Sheffield Hallam University. This diet always wins praise from nutritionists.  Stay close to family and friends In Okinawa, a Japanese island known as “land of the immortals” due to the number of centenarians, residents set up friendship groups known as ‘moai’. The term means ‘meeting for a common purpose’ and originated as a way for villagers to support each other in times of need,” explains Dan Buettner. Studies consistently show that social ­isolation is associated with several chronic health conditions. Get outside every day Even with the increased risk of skin cancer, those who enjoy the sun are less likely to die young than shade-seekers, say Swedish researchers who monitored , women over two decades. Good levels of vitamin D – triggered by sunshine – protect against diabetes, osteoporosis and other conditions. Walk briskly A fast walking pace is linked with a longer le regardless of a person’s weight, according to data analysis of nearly half a million Brits.Professor Tom Yates of University of Leicester, lead author of the study, said: “Perhaps physical fitness is a better indicator of le expectancy than body mass index , and that encouraging the population to engage in brisk walking may add years to their lives.” Make any journey less than a mile on foot Lack of exercise kills twice as many people as obesity, a Cambridge University study of , people found. Adding  minutes of walking into your daily routine five days a week can add three and a half years to your lespan. Put full-fat milk on cereal Researchers from Canada’s McMaster University looked at the diets of , adults over nine years and found those who consumed an average of . servings of full-fat dairy a day had the lowest rates of mortality cardiovascular disease and stroke.  A glass of full-fat milk, a teaspoon of butter or g of cheese equals one serving. Eat an apple a day... ...and some broccoli, a handful of blueberries, an orange – and drink a cup of tea. This combination provides a good range of flavonoids, which are naturally-occurring health-protecting compounds, say Australian researchers.  Be optimistic Positive people are more likely to live long, found a study analysing , women in a nurses’ health study and , men in a veterans’ health study. On average, the most optimistic men and women had an  to % longer lespan, and were more likely to live to at least  compared with the least optimistic group. The theory is that optimists suffer less stress. Book a break Taking regular holidays from work could prolong le, according to a -year study published in The Journal of Nutrition, Health  Aging. Professor Timo Strandberg, the study’s lead author at the University of Helsinki, said: “Don’t think having an otherwise healthy lestyle will compensate for working too hard and not taking holidays. Vacations can be a good way to relieve stress.” "},{"url":null,"title":"teen finds car after week","story":"NewsTeen finds car after a week despite having no idea where he parked it at festivalConnor Spear, , has finally been able to track down his Vauxhall Corsa after a Good Samaritan sent pictures of where it was parkedShareCommentsByDaniel Chipperfield:,  OCT NewsConnor will soon get his black Vauxhall Corsa back \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for the purpose of sending you newsletters.

Connor Spear, , drove more than  miles to attend Tokyo World in Eastville, Bristol, and parked the car far away from the busy site.But after the weekend event finished he had no recollection of where his Vauxhall Corsa was parked - despite a y search. Another -hour search this weekend also proved fruitless, BristolLive reported.Connor’s mum Sally Jeffery said: “I’m devastated and annoyed that he’s been so irresponsible.”  Connor left Plymouth with two friends last Saturday - September  - in his prized black Vauxhall Corsa, which his mum described as his “pride and joy”. The first day of the festival passed without incident, but disaster struck on the Sunday when Connor decided to drive so he could give friends a lt to the event. The story has caused considerable interest since the appeal was launched and thankfully now a kind man has sent them pictures of where the vehicle is parked. Connor has not yet retrieved his vehicle, but is set to be reunited with it in due course. She told  Plymouth Live: You know what lads are like, aposdo it later mumapos, but I needed to knowit’s out there. A kind man passes the car every day, it’s parked up safe. He sent me pictures of it this morning. There are a lot of lovely people around. We call [Connor] fun time Frankie as he always makes us laugh to make light of the matter, never a dull moment from Connor. Sally said she was so annoyed at first, but that her son has managed to turn the situation around. She said: We were so annoyed at first at how irresponsible he had been. At the time Connor and the friends who travelled to Bristol with him were fortunate enough to secure a lt back to Plymouth with someone they knew, but over the past week Connor has been forced to walk to his job as an apprentice at an electrical company. This weekend, however, the recovery mission stepped up a gear as Miss Jeffery drove herself and her son back to Bristol for a joint search effort. The pair spent eight hours roaming the streets of the city yesterday , focusing on Eastville, followed by a further three hours today.

And more than , people are expected to line the streets of Beijing beneath a firework-lit sky to witness it in person.Tuesday marks  years since the formation of Communist China and to trumpet the landmark, a magnicent military parade will enthral its citizens – and impress the world – as the focal point of week-long celebrations.President Xi Jinping will speak of unity, nationalism and progress. And whatever the world might think, it has no choice but to listen and watch. This will be a country revelling in its power.  Within  years, China is set to become the biggest economy in the world, leaving the US trailing. It’s an enormous shock,” admits Prof Kerry Brown, professor of Chinese studies at King’s College London. This is what we have to make sense of – a world where capitalism is everywhere and yet the most successful practitioner of it is a Communist country. So how did this Communist state reach this summit, when its original backer, the Soviet Union, fell  years ago  What President Xi won’t dwell on is that its rise was built on  catastrophic policies, bloodshed and fatalities by the million.  After a bloody civil war with China’s Nationalist Party, Mao Zedong, chairman of the Communist Party, finally claimed victory on October , .The country was then hit with Mao’s Great Leap Forward – his pursuit of an idealistic Communism which saw land snatched forindustrialisation, peasants  centralised into communes and agricultural output collapse.The result, through the s, was  million dying of starvation. In addition, from , Mao’s Cultural Revolution also saw a violent cleansing of the middle classes and intelligentsia. Millions more were to die. With the death of Mao in  came the “opening up” of China.  But, by the next decade, the country’s youth began to demand democracy – and that would not be tolerated by the Party. Protests were brutally quashed in  in Beijing’s infamous Tiananmen Square massacre. Thousands were reported shot or crushed by tanks. Human rights were challenged again by the country’s draconian one-child policy, introduced in , by a party fearful at having to feed a spiralling population. Only since  can parents have two children as the state now fears a population shrink. Yet the radical economic changes since the s have been nothing short of phenomenal. Prof Brown says: In , the society was pretty impoverished. The per capita GDP was about  – now it’s  or  times that. In , le expectancy was  and now it’s around .    The transformation will be on show during the celebrations in terms of China’s military might. A nuclear-armed missile that could reach the US in  minutes, the Dongfeng-, is thought to be part of the parade, plus a supersonic drone and a robot submarine alongside , troops. But Prof Brown says he doesn’t believe the message is one of global conflict. He explains: I don’t think China wants to be a global power because it doesn’t want the costs and expense. For the first time in decades, China must be wary of expense – millions suffer poverty, the economy has slowed and the country is fighting a trade war with a self-protectionist US. Yet the country is still on course for world economic domination.Any future UK trade relationship, however, has to be balanced with the human rights abuses and disturbingtotalitarianism in China."},{"url":null,"title":"crying baby found abandoned under","story":"NewsCrying baby found abandoned under motorway and covered in ant bitesThe infant was found after a passerby heard sounds similar to a cat coming from a thicket of bushesShareCommentsByJohn Feng:,  SEP Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news world-news video crying-baby-found-abandoned-under-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, subsets :[,,,,,],bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,hidePreviewImage:,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, subsets :[,,,,,],bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,hidePreviewImage:,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news world-news crying-baby-found-abandoned-under-\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for the purpose of sending you newsletters.

A study of more than , people analysed intake of red and processed meats as well as the risk of cancers, heart damage and dying early. Studies in Europe, the US, Australia and South America found most people are fine to continue eating between three and four portions a week. Researchers said “continuing their consumption” is right for most who eat these average amounts. Lead author Dr Bradley Johnston, of Dalhousie University in Canada, said: “Among  randomised controlled trials we did not find a statistically signicant or an important association in the risk of cancer, heart disease or diabetes for those that consumed less red and processed meat.    “While these new recommendations are bound to be controversial, they are based on the most comprehensive reviews of the evidence to date. “Those that seek to dispute the findings will be hard-pressed finding appropriate evidence with which to build an argument.” The study also looked at observational studies including millions of people which found those who ate three fewer servings of meat had improved health. But the authors said this evidence was “unreliable” as it is impossible to know whether it was the meat or other factors that increased the health risk in many of these studies. Current advice to cut red and processed meat is based in part on such evidence.    Dr Johnston added: “Based on the results we cannot say with any certainty that eating red or processed meat causes cancer, diabetes or heart disease.” The UK government recommends that people keep their total intake of red and processed meat to no more than about  g per day. Experts said the findings showed that “bacon is not killing us” but is likely to slightly increase our cancer risk. Dr Ian Johnson, food science expert at the Quadram Institute in Norwich, said: “This is a comprehensive and meticulous analysis of virtually all the available evidence on the relationship between meat consumption and human health. “There are strong environmental and ethical arguments for reducing meat consumption in the modern world. “In my opinion, people who choose to do so can still reasonably believe that they will experience modest reductions in their risks of cardiovascular diseases and cancers over a letime.  “On the other hand this study will, I hope, help to eliminate the incorrect impression sometimes given that some meat products are as carcinogenic as cigarette smoke.” It comes as a separate Cambridge University study shows that increasing vegetarian menu options saw people pick less “meat rich” options. A study of over , cafeteria meal choices has found that doubling the vegetarian options – from one in four to one in two – cut meat-rich purchases by % to % without affecting overall sales. A landmark global review of food production in the Lancet in January concluded more land use for plant-based diets would be needed to feed the global population - set to hit  billion by . Healthy sources of protein such as beans, peas, soy and nuts are being promoted to help reduce the Western diet’s reliance on processed meat.  Animal farming uses more land than crops and vast swathes of our remaining rain forests are being lost to make space for it. Food production is also a source of greenhouse gas and pollution. Previous evidence shows that too much processed meat slightly increases our risk of developing cancer. The World Cancer Research Fund says consumption of red and processed meats should be cut. Prof Tim Key, cancer expert at Oxford University, said: “There’s substantial evidence that processed meat can cause bowel cancer. “Recent estimates suggest over , people in the UK develop bowel cancer due to the consumption of processed meat each year.” "},{"url":null,"title":"dundee derbies to be shown live on bt sport as spfl announces fixtures to change date","story":"The SPFL has announced that two upcoming Dundee derbies will be moved so they can be broadcast live on BT Sport.United#s visit to Dens Park, originally scheduled for Saturday November , will now take place on Friday November  at .pm.Likewise, when the Dark Blues go to Tannadice during the Christmas period, the fixture will now take place on Friday December  at .pm, instead of the original date and time of Saturday December  at pm.These will be the second and third meetings between the teams after United won the previous derby at Tannadice - in August.POLL: Should Lawrence Shankland be called up for the next Scotland squads \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp poll-should-lawrence-shankland-be-called-up-for-the-next-scotland-squads embed # secretyfZTVNqwb\" data-secret\"yfZTVNqwb\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"The press release from the SPFL highlights the fixture chosen by both Sky Sports and BT Sports up to and including Sunday December ."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/09/US-Emmys-170826-846x564.jpg ","title":"dundee has starring role in episode of hbo drama succession","story":"Dundee is the special guest star in the latest episode of hit TV show Succession which stars the city’s own Brian Cox.The series is an American satirical comedy-drama based on the fictional Roy family who are the dysal owners of a global media and hospitality empire.Tonight#s show titled “Dundee”, was filmed in the city in June, and features a number of locals as extras in the series.It’s screened on HBO Sky Atlantic and filming has taken place around the city including the VA museum on Dundee’s waterfront.The episode is the last of series two which was first shown in June last year in America.It was created by writer Jesse Armstrong and the series has been renewed for a third term.This evening’s show has been described as “nestling at the heart of Dundee”, where Cox’s character is originally from, and it is based around a celebration of character Logan Roy’s  years running fictional media company Waystar Royco.The series has gained critical acclaim and, among its accolades, Succession won the British Academy Television Award for Best International Programme and actor Kieran Culkin received a nomination for the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor – in a Series, Miniseries or Television Film.The series also received five Primetime Emmy Award nominations, including Outstanding Drama Series. vw, px\"  It stars a cast featuring Hiam Abbass, Nicholas Braun, Cox, Culkin, Peter Friedman, Natalie Gold, Matthew Macfadyen, Alan Ruck, Sarah Snook, Jeremy Strong, and Rob Yang, with Dagmara Domiczyk, Arian Moayed, and J.

The atmosphere at the club on the training ground and in the dressing-room is really good so we just want the games to keep coming.”And former Scotland star Lee believes the players need to rise to the challenges and expectations they face every day working at the Tangerines.Asked what the biggest challenge for the players is, he added: “I would say it is coming in every day to an environment where you are expected to get better every day.“As a team and iniduals – coaching staff as well as players – we are all trying to get the best out of ourselves that we can.“That comes from a working environment where you don’t have any big egos.“It is about hard work every day and knowing that we should reap the rewards at the end of the seasonwe stick to it.”Lee also takes heart from the talented crop of youngsters coming through at Tannadice.“We are lucky we have so many good young boys coming through and we certainly have a fantastic U  team.“The lads in the reserves are really ready to kick on.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/09/2.21617220-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/09/2.21617220-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/09/2.21617220-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/09/2.21617220-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"win 100 with the teles fantastic strictly come dancing competition every friday","story":"Every Friday whilst Strictly Come Dancing is gracing our TVs the Tele is giving you the chance to cash in!Every Friday, each copy of the Eveningwill have the name of one of the dancers taking part on the show printed on the front page along with a Unique Reference Number.If your dancer is voted off on Sunday then you are in with a chance to win £!TO ENTER:Simply enter your dancer#s name and Unique Reference Number in the boxes below along with your contact details…that’s it!Good luck!Terms  Conditions:Entrants must register by midnight on Saturday, .

Rangers had  shots with  of them on target.Only the heroics of keeper Joe Lewis prevented a depressing defeat from becoming an embarrassing slaughtering.That the keeper was the standout man of the match in a five goal humiliation tells its own depressing story.Instead of going for a fourth win in Glasgow in a year, this became more an exercise in damage limitation. Yet still there was signicant damage inflicted.This was concrete confirmation of a sobering reality that normal service appears to have been resumed in Scottish football as to the domination of Celtic and Rangers. The Glasgow two look set to dominate the Premiership with teams like Aberdeen battling it out for third – at best.This completed a bad week for Aberdeen. They were terrible at Livingston but ground out a win.They blew a League Cup semi-final slot by conceding an equaliser in injury time and imploding in the penalty shoot-out.Aberdeen gave Rangers too much space by lacking the necessary aggression. Steve Davis and Ryan Jack dictated the game.Had the tenacity of injured Craig Bryson been available and the ball recycling of Funso Ojo the Dons will have been stronger to face a Rangers side clearly desperate to gain revenge for those three losses in Glasgow.Rangers dominated early possession, and had shots go wide from Morelos, twice, and Greg Stewart in the opening quarter hour.An inevitable opener came in the th minute when Morelos broke into the box and was brought down by Zak Vyner.Referee Bobby Madden awarded a penalty which James TAVERNIER blasted past Lewis.Moments later Morelos rounded Lewis before shooting from  yards but Mikey Devlin was placed to clear off the line.The overworked Lewis then saved from Sheyi Ojo and blocked a Scott Arfield  yard drive. It was - in the th minute when Arfield met a Tavernier cross but Lewis brilliantly pushed the header onto the post. STEWART reacted quickly to fire into the empty net from three yards.In the th minute Lewis yet again saved well to push a vicious  yard drive from Stewart behind for a corner.Stewart later hit the post.It was - in the th minute when Borna Barisic crossed from the left to the back post and MORELOS drted in unchecked to beat Lewis from six yards with an angled downward header.Morelos then had a goal bound shot deflected over the bar by Leigh. In the th minute the Reds mustered an effort when Devlin headed wide.Moments later Lewis again produced a superb save when pushing a powerful drive from Stewart over the bar.In the th minute it was - as Tavernier crossed into the box towards Stewart, who was bundled over by Leigh. TAVERNIER converted the spot kick.It was - as Jermain DEFOE drted in unchallenged to lt a shot over Lewis."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/09/2.45513070-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/09/2.45513070-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/09/2.45513070-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/09/2.45513070-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"two dons games chosen in latest tv selections","story":"Two Aberdeen fixtures have been chosen for live broadcast after the latest round of TV picks was made for Scottish Premiership matches in November and December.The Dons trip to McDiarmid Park on Sunday November  will be beamed live by Sky Sports with kick-off pm.On Wednesday December  Rangers visit Pittodrie and Sky will also show this clash with kick-off at .pm."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/10/2.44606530-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/10/2.44606530-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/10/2.44606530-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/10/2.44606530-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"aberdeen residents lose water supply due to burst main","story":"A burst water main has caused residents in the city to lose supply this evening.According to Scottish Water the issue is affecting homes in the Torry, AB area.The utility provider has said repairs to the burst main are under way and it expects supplies to be restored later tonight.A Scottish Water spokesman said: #We have a burst on an eight inch main in the AB area, which was reported earlier this evening around pm.#Engineers are currently on site and estimating the repair will be completed shortly.#The burst has impacted approx  addresses.

The two practices are run separately but with many shared resources. We don’t think the time is right to merge the practices completely but we do want a new logo and a name that recognises that we work very closely together.The winning entry will receive a cash prize and will then become the public image of our practices for the foreseeable future. In addition, in recognition of their support and contribution to our community, we are also making a donation to the Lochgilphead High School art and design department.We thank all of our patients for working with us over the past few years as changes have been made which require adjustment on all sides. Your understanding and patience is very much appreciated as we seek to find the safest way to deliver the most effective and high quality health care for us all.We look forward to seeing the talent of our local young people when competition entries close on October  and celebrating that talent when we announce our winner on October .Dr Andrew Strain, Lochgilphead Medical Centre and Furnace and Inveraray SurgerySir,My favourite activity at this time of the year is picking brambles. Now I am not saying this is the simplest or even healthiest of activities. All this crouching, hand staining, pricked fingers and even eye strain.Often when you reach for a large black juicy berry it seems to disappear. It’s like the behaviour of politicians. They offer so much but when you reach for it # it disappears. Do you remember the Scottish government passed a law guaranteeing one would be seen by an appropriate health specialist within a stated limited time  The SNP government daily breaks this law – be it on cancer, accident and emergencies, or mental health.Or what about the promises made to the people of Arran and the Outer Hebrides on improved ferry services. The Scottish government is responsible for Caledonian Maritime Assets, CMal, which own and manage ferries. MV Glen Sannox was intended to commence service to Arran in  but lies incomplete for all to see in the Ferguson Marine yard in Port Glasgow. Part of the delay is because of disagreement over the fixed-price design and build contract for the two vessels.The SNP seems obsessed with this type of contract which has adversely affected schools, colleges and community centres. Worse still, while the SNP ridiculed previous government public private partnerships they have introduced a system clearly no better. What about the £. million each month we the taxpayers have to pay for the unopened Edinburgh sick children’s hospital  Jeanne Freeman, the SNP Cabinet Secretary for Health and Social Care, stepped in so late that she does not know whether this much-needed hospital will ever open.The second part of the bramble experience is the delicious mouthwatering bramble crumble. A crumble which gives joy and stimulation. Not like the crumbling state of the SNP government which has a sour taste and clearly disappoints.Finlay Craig, CoveSir,Your readers may be interested to know that there are currently  people in need of a kidney transplant in Scotland whose diet will be restricted due to kidney disease.It is likely that they will be on fluid restrictions of around just ml of liquid a day # including liquid found in foods like sauces and ice cream. That is roughly the equivalent of only being able to have a small cup of tea and one can of soft drink per day. In addition, they may have to limit the potassium and phosphate in their diet which means missing out on enjoying foods like chocolate, bananas and tomatoes.We want to make the kidney diet about all the things patients can eat and bring enjoyment back into food # which is why we have launched the Kidney Kitchen.We hope that the Kidney Kitchen will mean everyone living with kidney disease in Scotland can enjoy healthy and delicious food with their family and friends.If you are, oryou know a kidney patient, check out www.kidneykitchen.orgEwen Maclean, advocacy officer Scotland, Kidney Care UKSir,The death of a pet cat can come as a shock, and many owners can find it dficult to come to terms with their loss.The death of a pet is not always seen as a signicant loss, leading some people to hide their feelings which can cause them to feel very alone.On Grief Awareness Day, August , Cats Protection is highlighting its free and confidential Paws to Listen support service, so people facing the loss of a cat do not have to feel alone.The service is available on   .

Last year, it rehomed over , domestic pets and successfully released , wild animals back to their natural environment. The society now also delivers industry-leading animal welfare educational programmes to people of all ages.In my short time with the society I know of hundreds of examples of our dedicated people going above and beyond to do all they can for the animals and humans they come across. So, I can only imagine how many fantastic stories must be out there about the people who’ve worn our unorm since we were formed.As well as those who have had a positive experience with us in the recent past, we are hoping to uncover some long lost tales from descendants of those we’ve touched in decades gone by.The society wants anyone with any interesting anecdotes or memorabilia to get in touch via the website or by emailing .years@scottishspca.org.Kirsteen Campbell, chief executive, Scottish SPCASir,The likelihood of the UK exiting the EU has now shted from ‘possible’ to ‘probable’.That gives greater focus to our efforts to prepare and proof our farming industry from the impacts of no deal.Whilst it always has been  the position of NFU Scotland that the UK must secure a favourable deal on the terms of exit with the EU, we must also support our industry through any change in the operating environment.Many NFU Scotland members might think that their businesses won’t be impacted, but the reality is that there will be implications for all of us. Some will be direct and immediate, and others more indirect and emerging through time – but the one certainty is that these will be felt by all of us involved in the agri-food chain.There are a few things that would make a big dferenceapplied right across the board in the UK.First, the UK Government’s proposed import tarf schedule desperately requires revision. It would expose some produce # specically cereals, oilseeds, potatoes, eggs and horticultural produce # to a tarf going into the EU, but would allow that same product to come into the UK with no tarf.This is farcical.To apply asymmetrical tarfs on any products between us and the EU is to completely misunderstand the nature of food security in the UK and fails to recognise that trade is vital to both the UK and the EU.One thing that can be done, regardless of Brexit, is for our own governments to prioritise using our own products when it comes to public procurement.All our politicians like to talk about how good our agricultural industry is in comparison to others across the world in terms of standards and environmental benefits, but we don’t see near enough in the way of Scottish or British products being prioritised for use in schools, hospitals and other public services.Yes, it may add one or two pence to a meal – but I would challenge governments and public procurement buyers what the real cost is of bringing products in from other parts of the world.These products certainly don’t meet our standards – not to mention the impact on climate change with food miles taken into consideration.It’s only a couple of years since the kids in our schools were getting their chicken from Thailand. Things are improving, but it’s still not Scottish chicken.This is within the gt of both Holyrood and Westminster, but it might just be the catalyst for governments to work with local authorities to do the right thing when it comes to feeding those who use our public services.Martin Kennedy, vice president, NFU ScotlandSir,I read with interest the letter from Doctor Strain in the August  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.Might I suggest that to produce a meaningful logo for the GP practices the following criteria are applied:The logo will need to show:May I suggest there are better ways to provide a service to treat patients, without resorting to gimmicks.Name and address supplied.Sir,I was intrigued to read Finlay Craig’s ramblings in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser.Would he be willing to share the location of his magical bramble bush for it appears the fruits of this bountul bush, when mixed into a pie, contain mystical properties that can transport the diner to another world May I suggest he tries a cold slice of reality pie now and again which would snap him out of his biased reverie and bring him back to the reality of the UK parliament being suspended and the Scottish representative of the party responsible for that outrageous manoeuvre vacating her post in protest In contrast, the Scottish government is working, along with others, to stop Scotland being dragged out of Europe against its wishes. Or perhaps the suspension of democracy is okay in his dream world If Mr Craig or any of his friends eat too much of his prodigious pie, I am sure they will not hesitate to avail themselves of a free prescription for their malaise and, should they need it, free bus travel to the chemist to pick it up, all supplied by the Scottish Government. If they live on one of our beautul islands, they can soon jump on one of the new ferries being completed as I write, again thanks to the Scottish Government.All this aside, when he rejoins us on planet earth, Mr Craig might think of entering his mysterious pie in the baking section of next year#s Mid Argyll Show, though I think by that time we may all be in need of something a little stronger from Scotland’s political larder to extract us from the bitter reality of Brexit Britain.Charles Ambrose, Lochgilphead.Sir,The National Autistic Society wants to find exceptional people, schools and services making a huge dference to autistic children and adults and their families.

It keeps its money as close to home as possible so that, amid historically drastic cuts, the amount spent locally has gone up as featured inon January ,  which notes #where other authorities privatise, Preston grows its own businesses#.Preston ensures that its resources prioritise local providers and businesses wherever possible. Argyll and Bute Council#s Procurement Strategy   falls some way short of this. Its stated aims commendably include:There is no particular emphasis, however, on using its resources to grow Argyll and Bute businesses, to reduce carbon emissions and food transport miles or to foster healthy eating strategies that would benefit our local farmers through #joining up the dots# of local supply and demand.The climate emergency demands a bolder and more innovative respond, and demands it now.Mary MacCallum Sullivan, ArdrishaigSir,I wish to comment on Mr Henderson#s  open letter to Brendan O#Hara in the September  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.The expression #crash out# of Europe is used by Conservative members of parliament, the BBC and the press. While emotive, this is what many people directly affected by Brexit feel is happening.For example, on the matter of Germans buying our fish without a trade agreement the tarf will be  per cent on our fish exports to the EU. The Germans will no longer buy our fish.We can all read about other examples of the harm being done in the press every day. The cost of implementing a no deal exit will be borne by all of us, through further austerity , increased taxes , increased national debt or a combination of all three. To my mind, such measures will indeed cause serious economic and social harm.While Brendan O#Hara received a minority of the votes in Argyll, the present government was elected  by less than  per cent of the  electorate.David Inglis, Ardrishaig.Sir,During this, National Air Ambulance Week , may I draw readers# attention to the amazing work of the country#s only charity-funded air ambulance service # Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance .Since  this le-saving service has been flying help and hope to communities all across Scotland in response to serious illness and injury.From our base at Perth Airport, we have responded to more than , time-critical emergencies and impacted on the lives of thousands # and the need goes on.The recently-established Scottish Trauma Network has seen four key major trauma centres created at hospitals in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee.

The centre was inspired by Catherine and her husband John after their experiences when John contracted Guillain-Barré syndrome.#I thought the notion of collecting crisp packets was brilliant, said Catherine, so I mentioned it to Michael one day.##Catherine suggested the crisp packet idea to me one day when I was in the Salty Dog Cafe,# explained Michael.After discussing it with teachers it was all systems go. Head girl Eilidh Logan designed snazzy posters to go around the school and the bags poured in.Michael concluded: #Collecting crisp bags is just so easy to do, and we are supporting recycling, prevention of littering and charity benefits too.#If you want to donate crisp bags, there are a number of collection points around Mid Argyll. Aside from Lochgilphead High School, you could hand them in to Mid Argyll Community Pool, Mid Argyll Sports Centre, Argyll Insurance in Lochgilphead, the MS and Dochas centres, Lochgilphead Community Centre and the Tayvallich Inn."},{"url":null,"title":"first round blow for depleted star","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsRed Star travelled to Barrhead last Saturdayto play Newlands in the West of Scotland Cup.

Drawing in a crowd from across Mid Argyll the band put on show to remember but it was just as memorable for the band. A sea of die-hard fans, in Robert Robertson masks, certainly took the singer by surprise as the group made their way to the front of the stage for a dance.The gig was in aid of Clachan Village Hall and organisers were thrilled that the concert was once again a sold-out event.The local pubs and hotels were quickly filled up to continue the party. As a warm up for their main stage gig on Sunday, The Mad Ferret Band drew in the crowds at The Corner House, while Gubbed had the Islay Frigate dance floor well used as they rocked the night away.The jam session in the harbour marquee on Saturday afternoon brought together a host of musicians, while a fantastic £. for festival funds was raised at the coffee morning held at Templar Arts and Leisure Centre.The Mad Ferret Band eased the Sunday survivors into the day’s event at the quay but it was not long before the crowd were back on their feet dancing and singing along. The great musical entertainment continued throughout the afternoon with performance from Gary Innes and Rhuvaal.Speaking after the weekend-long event, organiser Margaret MacNeill said: #Thanks to everybody who helped out with the coffee morning. Special thanks also to all the bands and everyone who came to support Tarbert Music Festival. Saturday was busier than ever, helped by the good weather.#Tide Lines brought something special to the weekend and the gig was sold out well in advance, so look out for more ticketed events in future.#"},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow health wrangle could add 1m to argyll overspend","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowAn overspend of more than £million is being forecast by health chiefs in Argyll and Bute for the current financial year – but health services are currently almost half a million in the black.The biggest threat to the year-end spending figures is a long-running dispute with NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde over charges for services.The figures were revealed in a report presented to members of the area’s Health and Social Care Partnershipintegration joint boardon Wednesday September .The HSCP was operating at an overspend of £, as of July , but while £, has been overspent on social work services, health has an underspend of £,.The vast majority of the projected overspend for   is on social work, at £.m, with a further £.m forecast to be overspent on health.Addressing the figures for the year to date, head of finance and transformation Judy Orr said: #Within health delivered services, the underspend is mainly due to successful appeal of rateable values following the last revaluation, rebates received and vacancy savings.#There are overspends on adult services linked to savings not being achieved in addition to increased costs for agency locum staff and GP prescribing.#There is also an overspend as we have not yet met our target for slippage on budget reserves which includes one-off, in-year allocations.#Within social work the overspends are mainly on learning disability joint residential and supported living and physical disability supported living arising due to service demands.#Within learning disability, the iance is caused by a failure to deliver planned savings along with spend above budgeted levels.#There are some offsetting underspends on central management costs within children and families and child protection due to staffing underspends and some slippage on expenditure and underspends on adult services central management costs due to phasing and reduced demand.#Efforts have been made in July to phase budgets more closely in line with historic patterns of expenditure and expected trends and to increase the correlation with the forecast.#On health, the underspend has increased by £, and continues the trend experienced in the first quarter. The main cause is the revised tarfs for out of area patients.#In addition, we have had a mental health long stay patient from out of our area which accounts for £, of the in-month movement which is unusual.#On the forecast year overspend, Ms Orr added: #The biggest single area of social work overspend is on learning disability, where there has been a failure to deliver anticipated savings so far, along with higher than budgeted demand.#This links closely with the year to date position. Again both are affected by the same factors. The next two largest areas of forecast overspend are physical disability and older people.#The biggest threat to the financial position of the IJB remains an ongoing dispute over service level agreement charges with NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, with the overspend liable to rise should no deal be reached.Ms Orr added: #The IJB made a decision to reject the increase [in service level agreement charges] and the forecast outturn reflects this position.

have already been expressed by the UK Department for Transport over the benefits of the reintroduction of tracks all the way to Carlisle.Momentum has been growing since funding was announced for a feasibility study earlier this year into taking the Borders Railway through Hawick, Newcastleton and across the English border.But the papers released by the Scottish government in response to a Freedom of Information request reveal that they cant give the go-ahead.And that support from south of the border is not universal.Among the released files and emails is a previously confidential Transport Position Paper from September, .It states: \" It should be noted that Scottish Ministers do not have the powers to construct a cross-border railway line as they only have the powers to construct a railway which starts, ends and remains in Scotland.\"Accordingly, the power to construct a railway line from Tweedbank to Carlisle in its entirety would rest with the UK Government.\"The signing of the Borderlands Inclusive Growth Deal partnership, which is made up of five local authority areas either side of the border, was seen as a major boost for the extension going ahead.The newly released papers show the partnership wrote in June  to Hamza Yousaf, then Scottish Transport Minister, regarding the Borders Railway extension.According to that letter: \"The Settle-Carlisle line shows the benefits of having alternative routes to support the resilience of the rail network.\"The line was threatened with closure in the s but following a successful campaign to keep it open the line was reprieved in .\"Since then the line has played a key role for re-routed main line passenger services when the West Coast or East Coast Main Lines have been closed and for freight services between Scotland Cumbria and the rest of England.\"The Borders Railway between Carlisle and Edinburgh could be equally successful in providing this vital role as an alternative route to the West and East Coast Main Lines for freight and passenger traffic and through this help maximise the growth of the Scottish and UK economy.\"But the enthusiasm and optimism wasnt shared by the UK Department for Transport.Feedback provided by the Department in July  stated: \"We are not convinced an extended Borders Railway would help with capacity issues on the West Coast Main Line.\"Assuming any such extension would have similar characteristics to the existing line i.e. slow and un-electried, it would not be attractive for re-routing any of the existing services using the West Coast Main

And why in one car park do you pay a charge only on a Saturday, but in another you pay every day Back in  the Area Partnership Forum formed a committee to look at off-street car parking in the town. In  they implemented new off-street parking conditions.Councillor Tatler branded the parking arrangement ldquounusual. He explained: ldquoWe have a big carpark where there is no charge all week and then there is on a Saturday. We have another smaller carpark where there is a charge, and then there is a free carpark.ldquoThe logic behind that was it would suit all the dferent people that would require car parking, so residents, visitors, traders and commuters as well.ldquoWhen they made that decision they said that they would review it and it should be reviewed regularly. We are now looking at not far short of five years later.But after suggesting a car parking review at the June meeting of the Area Partnership, there wasnrsquot a consensus amongst the six councillors.ldquoMyself and Councillor Eric Small feel that now would be a good time to have a look at it again. We will do research and gather evidence and report back to the future Area Partnership meeting.The councillors intend to go out into the community and talk to traders but they also want to hear from locals.Councillor Tatler said: ldquoWe would like to hear from the readers of the Peeblesshire. Do people think itrsquos worth us looking at those car parks does it still work for everybody ldquoI have had representation from constituents that during the summer months they find it dficult to park. I have also heard from people confused by the system. Also are we providing for commuters  I think itrsquos great that people park and ride, do we maybe need a separate facility somewhere or a distinct park and ride section. If everyone thinks its fine then wersquoll leave it.But the Tweeddale councillor thinks that the general public do want change.He told us: ldquoTherersquos a worry that we might be losing trade from visitors who come into the car park, circle round and then leave.

It tends to be used in less high quality coffee, such as instant coffee.--vw,vw,px, px\"--How does Arabica coffee get harvested and processed The ripe red cherries are either hand-picked, known as selective harvesting, or the plants are strip- harvested, where all cherries are taken off the branches either manually or mechanically.Once picked, the cherries are pulped, revealing the beans within. This is known as the wet method.The beans are fermented, laid out to dry in the sun and raked to ensure even drying.Any remaining skin and husks are removed during milling, before the beans are roasted, cooled and ground.In the dry method, the cherries are laid out to dry with the pulp still intact, and the dried outer layers are later removed by a machine.How popular is coffee in the UK Despite being better known as a nation of tea-drinkers, the UK has seen a surge in demand for speciality coffee in recent years.It has become one of the largest consumer markets for coffee in Europe.Recent research from the Allegra World Coffee Portal reveals that the total UK coffee shop market is valued at pound. billion across , outlets following two decades of growth.The EUrsquos Centre for the Promotion of Imports from developing countries says the UK is undergoing a ldquomajor sht from tea to coffee.Ground coffee and single-serve coffee pods are becoming increasingly popular, particularly among millennials, according to the British Coffee Association.--vw,vw,px, px\"Coffee pods are becoming increasingly popular --Where does coffee come from Vietnam is the largest developing country supplier of coffee beans to the UK, responsible for more than a fth of the market, according to the EUrsquos Centre for the Promotion of Imports.Brazil and Indonesia closely follow, while Peru is the sixth largest exporter to the UK, accounting for .% of the market.How is climate change affecting coffee growth Peru is the fth most-affected country in the world by climate change.The delicate Arabica bean is being threatened by unpredictable weather patterns, rising humidity and diseases.Brown eye spot fungus thrives in conditions of high humidity and rain and causes small brown spots to form on the surface of leaves.When berries are infected, they ripen before the beans are mature, and this can result in problems with flavour when the coffee is processed.The coffee rust disease leaves orange dust on the underside of leaves, causing them to fall off and preventing the plants from photosynthesising.In Peru, farmers are switching to lower quality, more resilient ieties or abandoning it altogether for more reliable, profitable crops like sugar cane, cocoa and rice.But even some of these crops are suffering as a result of unpredictable weather.Globally, coffee rust is present in all coffee-producing regions.By , up to half the land currently used globally to grow coffee could have become unusable for this purpose due to climate change, experts predict.A report by Fairtrade in France predicts that certain ieties of coffee could become extinct by , making coffee crops more homogeneous ndash and therefore less rich and resilient.--vw,vw,px, px\"--What could the impact be With coffee consumption rising each year, the future struggles of providers to meet this demand and diminished yields could lead to rising prices.With more high-quality iants of bean failing to adapt to the uncertain climate, it could also mean less quality coffee as farmers swap to more resilient alternatives.The possible impact in the UK could be that coffee becomes a long-term luxury and quality will be sacriced.What is Fairtrade doing to help Fairtrade will celebrate its th anniversary in the UK in October, after being launched as a result of the coffee crisis in the s.With historically-low market prices, the Fairtrade minimum price means farmers selling under those terms are protected and able to continue farming by receiving a stable, higher price.Those struggling to grow coffee due to increasing climate dficulties are being supported to stay in the farming industry by ersying into dferent crops.The Fairtrade investment is also being used to help farmers innovate and adapt.For example, farmers who can invest in concrete drying s are able to produce better quality coffee than those who dry the beans on the ground.And machines speed up production, when previously workers would have had to complete the process by hand..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: How is climate change affecting coffee production "},{"url":null,"title":"british-proposals-border-rejected-deputy-irish-pm","story":"Reported plans by the British Government to create customs posts along both sides of the Irish border to replace the backstop, have been dismissed by Simon Coveney.Irish State broadcaster RTE reported the suggestion sent to the European Union by the UK would lead to the posts being built between five and  miles back from the current border.The idea for the customs posts are contained in the so-called lsquonon-papersrsquosubmitted by UK officials during recent technical discussions.The deputy Irish premier poured cold water on the plans, saying Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland ldquodeserves better.He tweeted: ldquoNon-Paper  Non-Starter.

Assisted by Scott Souden’s low cross from the left flank, the substitute striker guided a delightful flick into the net beyond the Glynhill keeper. Taking on the role of target-man with gusto, Radecki played a big part in the Feathers-sponsored Pupils’ fourth goal, when he held off a defender down the right wing and crossed to substitute Calum McKillop, whose back-heel flick found Souden at the penalty spot, and the -year-old winger, making the journey home from Edinburgh for a game, passed the ball into the net with ease to complete the scoring.The game became a procession in the closing minutes with man-of-the-match Crossan, the midfield linchpin alongside the impressive Liam Renton, orchestrating some controlled possession football, but there was some trouble on  minutes when a malicious foul on ex-Dumbarton man D McCallum sparked into a melee with players from both sides involved. It resulted in a second booking for Kenny Kerr, a yellow for J McCallum, and a red card for the original Glynhill culprit, as well as yellow for the visiting keeper from referee Jimmy Litster, after charging from his own goalmouth to become involved.Undeterred, the Pupils settled back down to seal a richly deserved victory,achieved through a disciplined and determined performance.The Kintyre Park side will now enjoy a free week, with ato action scheduled for Saturday October , opponent to be confirmed.For fixture updates, and to see second-half action and goals from last Saturday’s match, see Campbeltown Football on Facebook, or @PupilsAFC on Twitter."},{"url":null,"title":"weather wont play fair for men","story":"Strong winds, for most of the players, deflected several balls into the severe rough and out of bounds and pushed scores upwards.Robert Shaw, one of the first out in the morning ballot, had an excellent round to finish on a nett  from Ken MacMillan on nett .The wind continued in the afternoon but didn#t deter John Docherty from the best scratch score of the day.

However, it was the home side that took the lead on the nd minute when Ashfield’s centre forward cut in from the left before sending an unstoppable shot in to the top corner.A test of character was required from the boys as they fell behind and with five minutes of the half remaining they were rewarded after a corner dropped to Stuart Phillps in the box. The young forward adjusted his feet quickly to send a beautul curling shot past everyone to make it -.Fteen minutes into the second half the Pupils took the lead. New signing Raphael MacLachlan, playing in only his second appearance for the s, sent in a delightful whipped corner that brushed off the Ashfield centre-half into the goal to make it -. The Clachan youngster can be proud of his impact on the game and is already proving to be a valuable addition to the team.As the Pupils pressed for their third of the game a long ball evaded the defence to allow the Ashfield number  in again to equalise with  minutes remaining.As the game drew to a close, it looked like both sides would share the points until a dramatic final minute. A long clearance by Ashfield was misjudged by the Pupils defence to allow Ashfield’s player in with a chance of his hat-trick but the youngster scuffed his shot into thankful hands of Pupils goal-keeper Lorne Paterson.Knowing it was the final minute, Paterson tried to kick the ball up the field as quickly as possible only for it to cannon off the back of Euan O’May’s head! It landed back in Paterson’s hands and he quickly dispersed the ball, long up the field where the ball bounced high over everyone, only for Calum Ellis to nip in front of the Ashfield centre-half, run in on goal, calmly round the advancing goal-keeper and stroke the ball home to make it - to the Ardshield Hotel-sponsored side – much to the delight of his fellow team mates and coaches.Ellis who has now scored seven goals in the Under s# opening four games.This weekend the team will enjoy a free fixture due before playing at home to Glasgow Boys Club on Sunday October ."},{"url":null,"title":"farmer told to be of good behaviour","story":"Fergus Wilkie, , of Crossibeg Farm, had previously admitted engaging in behaviour which caused a woman fear and alarm by loitering and following her outside her place of work and in a supermarket.

He was in Scotland mainly to play golf and try whisky, he told me. I was trying to convince him Scotland had many other things to offer and we got onto the issue of Scotlandrsquos landscape. He seemed interested in how our land was used, and he told me that back home he owned a ranch, which included a medium-sized forest of native trees.I remember saying ldquowow, thatrsquos so special, but he shook his head, saying: ldquoSpecial  No, not really, a stupid law means the forest is worthless.I was a bit confused, so I asked him what he meant. ldquoTherersquos a preservation order on it, which means that part of my land is unproductive, he said.I realised at this point that although we were having the same conversation about land, we were having dferent understandings of it.He shook his head sadly and said: ldquoItrsquos just a waste of good timber.That kind of ended our conversation. I didnrsquot try to persuade him to think dferently, I felt that I wasnrsquot in a position to do that since he was a paying customer and my tip could have been at stake.That conversation was nearly  years ago. And yet his comment ldquoitrsquos just a waste of good timber has stuck with me ever since. The reason for this was the mindset it revealed. I found it depressing that he could not see the value of something so precious because it would make him no financial profit.As my kids get geared up for the school climate strike this week, I realise now this mindset is one which has to be challenged. When I look back, I am ashamed of myself that I did not have the courage to speak out to the man, simply because I needed his tip.There are many parts of the climate crisis, but one truth within the debate is trees are our le. I have seen one calculation that each human breathes in the oxygen produced by around eight trees. So count the number in your family and those you love and multiply by eight. That is the number of trees needed to help your family and loved ones breathe. For sure, trees arenrsquot the only source of the oxygen we breathe, but they are a signicant part of it, and they hold tons of carbon. Surely that alone is lsquoprofitrsquo enough.But while the riches of woodland go way beyond that of timber profit, I understand that environmental destruction is linked to poverty as well as greed. We need to challenge both. But we will never do thiswe are made to be too afraid to speak out, either because we fear those who wield financial power over us, or the ridicule of others who as yet donrsquot get it.In a storytelling session last week for a P class in an East Lothian primary school, I told the tale of the king who wanted to touch the moon. He always gets his way because people are afraid of him, so the forest in his kingdom is cut down to make a tower of wooden boxes to the moon. But he is impatient and foolish, and falls from the tower, and the boxes all get smashed. The forest has been destroyed for the kingrsquos failed vanity project, while his people remain poor and still afraid of him.One of the girls in the class put her hand up then said: ldquoBut we need trees to live. Later she told me: ldquoThey should get rid of the kinghe doesnrsquot change his bad ways.Many of our young people get it. Itrsquos their future. We can all make our own small personal contribution, but to save our childrenrsquos future, courage is needed to speak out, for adults too.Never again will I remain silent, for either reward or fear of ridicule. There is too much at stake, not just for me but for my children and this dear planet which is home for us all, but dying in our care."},{"url":null,"title":"haddington-parking-plans-discussion-held-private","story":"East Lothian Council is working on designs that would see the parking provision changed in the town, including the possibility of a -plus-space long-stay car park on the townrsquos Whittingehame Drive.However, town centre traders are concerned about the possibility of spaces being lost on High Street and Market Street, with it also being mooted that the long-stay car park at Tesco, which is used by many people working in the town centre, could become short-stay only.The issue was briefly mentioned at the townrsquos community council meeting last Tuesday evening.Usually, these meetings are open to the public and the press however, it was agreed to cut short next monthrsquos meeting to allow community councillors to discuss the controversial plans in private.Jan Wilson, the grouprsquos long-standing chairwoman, said: ldquoIrsquom not sure how much can be made public at the moment.ldquoI know community council meetings should be public but there are times when I have to say no because the proposals are not set in stone yet.

What exactly fostered it I cannot say, but for sure the stories of lsquoMadam Butterflyrsquo, a teacher at Preston Lodge, was part of it, and perhaps also the history that I was visibly surrounded by when I left Prestonpans and moved to Edinburghrsquos Old Town as a teenager.What I do remember from these times is a powerful feeling that I was lucky to have this interest. It kept me going when I was having bad times, because there was always something that interested me or stimulated my fascination.I have realised now that part of historyrsquos appeal is the images it creates for us, of a time that is dferent to ours. No matter how many lsquofactsrsquo there may be, itrsquos our imaginative interpretation of them which makes this information interesting or fascinating.This is why archaeology can also be particularly interesting. Itrsquos a tantalising glimpse into the past but leaves lots of scope for our own imaginative recreations. This connects to the fact that we often hold fascination for things we have lost because we cannot physically experience them anymore.For me, this is the case every time I travel through the Hardgate in Haddington. Until the s, a building stood on the east side of the street, where now there is a small grassy park. Locals nicknamed the building Bothwell Castle, although it wasnrsquot a castle in the real sense, but an impressive town house owned by the Cockburns of Sandybed, hence its original name, Sandybed House. Old photos of it show it in a rundown condition even a hundred years ago, but still looking magnicent.Nobody now will remember what it looked like inside before its dilapidated state. A drawing of the interior from the s shows it had wooden ling, described as ldquoexcellent examples of native craftsmanship.The most prominent feature from the street was perhaps the circular stair tower, which also had the original entrance. It was this feature that made the building look like a castle, I reckon. Inside there was a sunken floor, two upper floors and an attic. It enclosed a courtyard and the building ran eastwards to the banks of the River Tyne.There is a scarcity of historical information about this building, which was demolished to widen the road, after ious attempts to save it failed.But there is at least one story which lights my imagination whenever I am standing in the small green park where Bothwell Castle once stood.It involves the notorious James Hepburn, th Earl of Bothwell, the man who murdered Mary Queen of Scotsrsquo husband Darnley and then married her himself, after seemingly abducting her.But the story takes place before all this, during the time when Maryrsquos mother, Mary of Guise, was fighting the Protestant Lords of the Congregation. Despite being a Protestant, Bothwell was on the side of the Catholic queen. He was young but one of the most powerful nobles in the land.In , Bothwell received information that a huge sum of money was being sent by an English nobleman called Sir Ralph Sadler to help the Lords of the Congregation. He lay in wait and attacked the carrier of the money, both robbing and wounding him.This act enraged the leaders of the Protestant cause and some time afterwards the leaders, the Earl of Arran and Lord James Stewart, headed for Haddington to capture Bothwell.The house he was staying in was close to the River Tyne. But he saw the soldiers approaching just in time and fled. He got to the river and waded along its banks until he reached Sandybed House.He knew he had likely been spotted and his pursuers were hot on his heels. So he entered Sandybed House by the back door. He could hear the shouts from the soldiers outside and knew he had little time to hide, but where He ran into the kitchen, where a spit boy sat turning the spit. There was not a moment to lose.ldquoQuick, gie me yer claes tae wear, Bothwell commanded. The young lad, unable to refuse an order from such a powerful noble, immediately obeyed. Bothwell, being a slim young man himself, was just able to slip them on.Then Bothwell sat by the fire and began to turn the spit, pretending to be the spit boy, whom he commanded to leave and to take his clothes. We have no account of the moment the soldiers entered the kitchen. It will have been a tense one. Bothwell will have felt the heat, both of fear and of the fire on his face and hands just a small and very short taste of the harsh le of a spit boy.The soldiers did not recognise that the spit boy was actually Bothwell sitting in disguise in the half dark flickering light of the kitchen. Servants with such a lowly status were barely even noticed anyway by the noble class. They were almost like part of the furniture to them.There is a story that he then fled to his castle at Hailes dressed as a woman. It is said he later rewarded Cockburn of Sandybed for not giving him away, but one wondersthe spit boy was also rewarded.I suspect not. However, I like to think he was somehow able to keep Bothwellrsquos clothes, and I wonderthe woman got hers back.No doubt the spit boy often told his story as he turned the spit, cooking it as much as the meat.Sadly, the kitchen where this took place has gone now, of course. But is it In , a community archaeology project was undertaken, part funded by the Peter Potter Gallery Monument project. Archaeologist David Connolly explains in a fascinating YouTube clip that the dig revealed parts of Bothwell Castle. He shows that the lintel above the door into the kitchen lies just under the ground. In fact, the remains of the kitchen are just part of a mass of archaeological finds in the Hardgate, going back to Medieval times.These finds are covered up now, butyou venture yourself to the wee park in the Hardgate you can still see the disturbed ground where they took place.And look closely at the wall by the road, next to the southern entrance. There is a strange curve in the wall here. Thatrsquos because the lower section of this part of the wall is in fact the remains of the circular stair tower of Bothwell Castle.A buddleia butterfly bush was growing by it when I visited last week, but my long-suffering family waited as I ventured under the bush to take a photo of what I believe to be the old stonework of the stair tower.I then told them the story of the spit boy as we sat on the location of the kitchen. The river is just beyond and as we left the park I couldnrsquot get an image of Bothwell dressed as a washer woman out of my head.As I say, history can be fascinating because it stimulates our imaginative interpretation!"},{"url":null,"title":"pipers-become-movie-stars-bands-unusual-new-calendar","story":"Haddington Pipe Band launches its  calendar this weekend, with this yearrsquos taking on a movie theme.The launch is at the townrsquos The Loft Cafe today , where the  shots that were taken for the calendar by photographer Paul Bock will be on show until January.Alastair Bruce, from Haddington Pipe Band, said: ldquoWe decided on a slightly dferent approach this time round and wersquove certainly had a lot of fun putting these shots together.ldquoOur inspiration was iconic film posters so, working with Paul, we have recreated and re-interpreted  well-known posters and given them all a piping and drumming twist, with band members taking the starring roles.ldquoWersquove also put a spin on the titles and the other text which featured on the originals.The group are recreating posters from popular movies including Braveheart, Trainspotting, Harry Potter, Chariots of Fire, The Sound of Music and Pirates of the Caribbean.Alastair added: ldquoItrsquos a pleasure to pay tribute to Paul Bock, who has done an absolutely fantastic job with the shots his creativity was unbelievable.ldquoAimee Colley of Shaw Marketing and Design also did a terric job creating the artwork and Lori Walker was a huge help in turning band members into film stars with her make-up skills.ldquoOf course, the real stars are the band members themselves!ldquoWe are also extremely grateful to the many businesses and organisations who have kindly sponsored the production.

We are told there is a two week wait when all the anecdotal evidence is that it is at least threenot four weeks.A spokesperson from Riverside said: ldquoIn East Lothian, as in many parts of Scotland, people are living longer with increasingly complex health and care needs.ldquoIn response to this growing challenge, Riverside Medical Practice has been working hard over the last few years to transform the way our patients are being cared for, working closely with a wider range of healthcare professionals to ensure the right care is provided by the right person at the time help is needed.ldquoThrough this, the practice has made signicant improvements in providing lsquosame dayrsquo appointments for those whose health concern may be urgent. In addition, through making these positive changes, Riverside has been able to provide more and longer advance bookable GP appointments.ldquoRiverside is growing our team of GPs and has successfully recruited seven new GPs over the last two years.ldquoThe practice is currently going through a period of signicant telephone and clinical systems upgrades that will not only address the limitations patients at the Riverside practice have experienced but will introduce a new low-charge  number.ldquoOnce complete, the upgrades, in line with the new way of working, will provide long-term benefits for all patients in the area.

After  months, wersquove barely reached base camp, yet we canrsquot give up now. The gardens hereabouts are a constant reminder of how much there is to learn. Some of them are as lovely as Sissinghurst or Inverewe, and quite obviously require as much hard work. As a result, when neighbours meet, conversation is more likely to turn to brassicas and box blight than Brexit and the Backstop. Also high on the agenda are butterflies and bees, the absence or superabundance of rain, heat surges, the proleration of wasps, and the effect of all the above on the quality of their compost. If you chance to look up at the sky, someone will guess, to within a degree of accuracy, what the next dayrsquos temperature will be.This must be because, like gardeners everywhere, they are acutely attuned to the weather. Other than farmers, I doubt there is any single group more intensely aware of our climate, and the ways in which it is fast changing. For some of them, the young Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg is like Joan of Arc, fearlessly confronting the forces of destruction, and inspiring all of us to be more vocal, angry and proactive. If you have a garden, you cannot be unaware that when she says ldquochange is coming, whether you like it or not, itrsquos not a prediction for the far future. Change is already here. Indeed, serious gardeners are already taking steps, tree by tree, shrub by shrub, to mitigate or adapt to its impact.This became particularly evident last weekend at a Gardenerrsquos Question Time, run by Borders Organic Gardeners, in St Boswellrsquos village hall. The room was packed with people so experienced they cast Monty Don into the shade. A  of three experts, including this paperrsquos gardening columnist Dave Allan, held their nerve for almost two hours to answer a barrage of questions that ranged from how to deal with snails and slugs , and the best apple trees for a cold spot .Opinion ied on what tree to plant to replace a dying ash, but in answering, the alpine expert Ron McBeath said that all our ash trees will probably be gone within ten years. There would even be spores carrying ash dieback in the village hall where we sat, he told us, making a few of us shuffle our boots. It was an uncomfortable reminder that certain forces are beyond control, some bad situations irreversible. Other, thankfully less devastating, diseases were mentioned, heading northwards in our direction on the warming thermal tide. Above all, as Emma Emmerson, of Woodside Plant Centre near Ancrum remarked, everyone is noticing the ldquocollapsed seasons, and the challenges they present to making a garden grow as it did in the past.Concern in the hall was palpable. Gardeners are in the frontline of climate change, seeing in miniature what is happening in the world at large. The  discussion ranged over what we could do to help wildle and especially birds to thrive ndash cat lovers should lock up their pets ndash but in terms of plants, it would seem that we are approaching uncharted territory. Old certainties are no longer reliable.Sombre though it sounds, it was not an afternoon of gloom ndash quite the reverse. For a start it was a reminder of how much fun it is to grow things and, in the case of vegetables and fruits, to watch them ripen, before falling upon them with kne, fork and spoon. It was also an encouragement, for beginners like me, to get more serious. To learn that, across the UK, more land is covered by gardens than by nature reserves is to understand the humble back yard or allotmentrsquos place in a giant living patchwork. Each of these plots, and not just those abiding by organic principles, stands guard on the ramparts, defending the gate against attack.This mild month, with bees still nose-deep in our flower beds, and hedges quivering with sparrows, finches and tits with owls keeping us awake from the horse chestnut tree outside the window, hedgehogs rootling in the field we call our lawn, and a young woodpecker learning his trade on the telegraph pole by our fence, it becomes abundantly clear that the place you like to think of as your own is in fact shared with thousands of other creatures.That will not be news to those who have gone out of their way to help feed the birds. A recent survey showed that in Britain enough food is served to sustain  million birds every year. Species that were struggling  years ago are now making a comeback, among them goldfinches and nuthatches.Itrsquos a glimmer of hope amid the increasingly apocalyptic language around climate change. As the villagersquos green-fingered army shows, there is nothing egotistical or self-centred about people devoted to the upkeep of their borders and trellises, their fruit trees and raised beds. When Voltaire wrote, ldquoit is our duty to cultivate our garden he was not, for once, being sarcastic. A passionate gardener who, as he grew older, craved the simple le, he understood the deeper meaning to be found in tending your own patch. The upkeep of that little bit of earth results in spiritual well-being as well as a barrowload of juicy carrots. Those of us cheering on crusaders like Thunberg can still raise our own battle standard. It should be planted carefully between the raspberry canes or beside a clematis or, in our case, among the rampant, bee-friendly weeds."},{"url":null,"title":"face-face-glasgow-born-downton-abbey-composer-john-lunn","story":"But there are some days when the -year-old Scot really does feel a little giddy at it all. One came earlier this month when he was flown to New York and, suited and booted, invited to walk the red carpet at the star-studded US premiere of the film version of Downton Abbey, everyonersquos favourite Edwardian upstairs downstairs romp.ldquoIt was spectacular, he says, still sounding a little awestruck. ldquoThey had a fantastic party afterwards in the Plaza Hotel, opposite Central Park. I still do pinch myself a little bit, I have to say.Lunnrsquos compositions have been a staple of Downton Abbey since it first aired in . He has scored each of its six series as well as the film version, which is set in  and finds the Crawley family entertaining King George V and his we Queen Mary. It was for his work on the blockbuster series that he won the two Emmys, the first in in , the second the following year. It also brought him a Royal Television Award for Best Score though in its way the accolade bestowed on him by Classic FM is perhaps most telling of the lot: in a  listenersrsquo poll of the best TV theme ever written, Lunnrsquos Downton Abbey Theme came top.Looking back, Lunn admits to being ldquoquite surprised at how well liked Downton Abbey was when the first series aired .ldquoI thought it would do well because the production values really were pretty high, it looked good, there was some great acting and it was well written, he says. ldquoBut like everybody  I was a bit surprised that the subject material would prove to be so popular. Irsquod done things like Little Dorrit [] and Bleak House [], Dickens adaptations which were enormously successful here and in America, and I thoughtit does as well as either of them, thatrsquoll be great. Irsquoll be perfectly happy with that. Little did I know it would eclipse both of them by some distance.But while nobody now doubts the power of the series on the small screen, it still wasnrsquot a given that it would translate well to the multiplex.ldquoWhat everybody was concerned about was whether we could motivate an audience who was used to seeing it on a Sunday evening to go to the cinema, says Lunn. ldquoBut amazingly, that seems to have happened.And how. When the film was released in the US it beat both Brad Pittrsquos Ad Astra and Sylvester Stallonersquos Rambo: Last Blood to top the box office, taking  millionin its opening weekend and setting a new record for what industry bible Variety terms a ldquospecialty studio . The reviews werenrsquot bad either.Lunn has lived most of his adult le in London but he was born in Glasgow in , grew up in Bridge of Allan from the age of five and attended Stirling High School. Although born to musical parents ndash his father had played in a jazz band in the s ndash he came late to playing music himself.ldquoBecause my father had been a sax player there was a lot of music in the house. At the age of  or  I was kind of absorbing it all and I got into a lot of the rock music that was around then, like Led Zeppelin and Jimi Hendrix. My dad suggested I take up an instrument and I heard Paul Tortelier playing the cello on the television and thought lsquoThat sounds quite interestingrsquo.He asked at school and was told there was no chance of cello lessons, buthe wanted he could try the double bass instead. He decided to give it a shot. He was  at the time, quite old to be taking up an instrument.ldquoAs soon as I started I just knew. I got really good at it really quickly. I took up piano lessons about six months later and after that nobody could stop me. Nobody had to tell me to practice.ldquoTo be honest, I think I was a bit unhappy before that. Those early years at secondary school are quite dficult and I didnrsquot quite know where I fitted in. I was scrabbling around looking for something to hold on to and music provided that in abundance. I just went with it.His next move, then, was a no-brainer: Glasgow University where, aged , he studied music and threw himself and his double bass into the cityrsquos music scene. At one point he played in a band with Craig Armstrong, now also a noted composer of film scores.In  Lunn was offered a publishing contract with Chrysalis Records and moved to London. He has lived in the city ever since. For a few years he became, as he puts it, ldquoa bit involved in pop music but his preferred outlet was a series of bands he describes as ldquoexperimental. The most notable was Man Jumping, an electro-jazz fusion group signed to EG Records, also home to Brian Eno, Robert Fripp and Penguin Cafeacute Orchestra.He wrote his first score for television in , for a BBC play called The Gt, and throughout the early s he continued to write for long-forgotten series such as Backup and The Ghostbusters Of East Finchley. Then, in , came his big break: Hamish Macbeth, an amiable BBC drama following the le of a policeman in rural Scotland.Filmed in Plockton, it ran to three series and proved an unlikely hit. Lunn wasnrsquot the only one involved who moved on to bigger and better things. Robert Carlyle had the title role andyou scan through the credits yoursquoll also find Shirley Henderson and Alastair Mackenzie as well as Skins creator Bryan Elsley and Oscar-winning director Danny Boyle, in a rare writing role.Today, Lunn isnrsquot the only working composer with the Midas touch. But since that first major commission his CV has been peppered with landmark productions, many of them period pieces. There was The White Queen, nominated for a Golden Globe in . There was Bleak House, nominated for  Emmy Awards and winner of the Best Drama Serial award at the  BAFTAs. There was Burton And Taylor, which starred Dominic West and Helena Bonham Carter as the starring battling couple and which picked up a clutch of award nominations on both sides of the Atlantic. There have been many others.With his own Emmy wins and the higher profile they brought, Lunn would have been well placed to make the move to the US. Was he ever tempted  He had plenty offers, he says, but he turned them down.ldquoIt was a dficult period for me to have gone over to America because both my kids were in secondary school and they were quite happy where they were.

The estimate was released as Highland Council began a public consultation on the controversial plan.The North Highland Initiative did not respond to questions surrounding the reasons for NHI relinquishing control of the NC company and what it meant for its operation.But a spokesman accentuated the positives of the operation and how it had benefited the region.He said: ldquoThe aim was to create a self-funding, self-sustaining commercial company that could continue to promote the North Highlands through the North Coast  brand.ldquoNorth Coast  Ltd was founded in January  to do just that and to deliver enhanced opportunities for businesses and communities throughout the area.ldquoPotential investors expressed an interested in supporting the aims and objectives of the initial concept and subsequently converted that interest into a shareholding.ldquoThe loss for the year demonstrates the need for the company to invest in people and resourceswe are to continue to drive the socio-economic benefits to the North Highlands.ldquoThere is clear evidence why we should continue to do this as the investment to date has created outstanding impacts for many businesses in the North Highlands and has put the region on a global .ldquoThe Board are aware of the challenges of being the creators of a new model of tourism development and the associated monetisation of the brand and will continue to be innovative in developing income streams and cost efficiency.The NHI has previously said that its use of tourism ldquoas a vehicle for creating sustainable communities resulted in the creation of NC, ldquowidely regarded by the media and experts as the number one touring route in the world.It said that the -mile route around the north coast has attracted an audience of . billion people around the globe in  and is credited with creating an additional  jobs in its first year of operation.Further to that, it said an economic impact survey revealed that the creation of the route added an additional poundm to the North Highland economy in .The Danish billionaire, who is also the chief executive and sole owner of the international clothes retailer chain Bestseller, like hundreds of thousands of other tourists who visit the Highlands every year, was captivated by its rugged beauty when he visited for an angling holiday with his parents in the s.Two decades later, the second-largest inidual private landowner in the UK, the biggest in Scotland, ed to the country he had fallen in love with ndash but this time with the aim of buying up parts of the countryMr Povlson, who is reportedly worth pound.billion bought the ,-acre Glenfeshie estate in the Cairngorms for poundm in .The estatersquos Glenfeshie Lodge, which was built in about , continues to serve as Mr Povlsenrsquos private Highland home, and has featured in films and TV series including The Crown and The Queen.He was struck by tragedy earlier this year when three of his four children, Alma, Agnes, and Alfred were killed at the Shangri-La Hotel, Colombo during the  Sri Lanka Easter bombings while they were on holiday there.Mr Povlson is thesingle shareholder in the Asos online retailer, and his we have continued to snap up huge swathes of the Scottish countryside.They are said to now own about , acres across  estates which he hopes to join together and rewild.In Tongue, Sutherland, the couple have renovated two properties with a third, Lundies House manse,in the process of being refurbished.The Povlsonshave also bought a shop to keep the community thriving.Wildlands have also advertised jobs to assist them in running high-end guest houses in the north to meet the needs of the growing tourist market drawn to the area by the North Coast ."},{"url":null,"title":"Iain Macwhirter  Traitor  Liar  The Commons is becoming more like Twitter than Twitter","story":"Some pundits were saying that this unrestrained, aggressive style of political debate began with the  Scottish referendum. But the Indyref was never like this. There may have been a deal of bad language and anger on the fringes of the internet, where Yoons and Cybernats clashed by night, but never in parliament.The Commons went slightly mad last week, with hysterical finger pointing, tears and shouting. It was like a class of unruly school-kids in the middle of a sugar rush. Please miss: he called me a liar. No, I didnt. Yes, you did. Well, you started it by calling me a traitor. Miss! Miss! Only there was no one able to control this rowdy collection of over-wrought political egos, least of all the Speaker.So, who did start it  Well, Boris Johnson by deploying his rebarbative, war-time rhetoric. Calling the Benn Act the ldquoSurrender Act. Accusing MPs of being ldquotraitors, ldquobetraying the people. It was demeaning, even for him. But Im not going to apportion blame exclusively to the Prime Minister. Everyone has lost the plot over Brexit ndash not least Labour MPs, who repeatedly accuse Johnson of being a ldquoracistand a ldquotin pot dictator staging a ldquocoup.Why did the Labour MP Paula Sherrf think it wise to invoke the murdered MP, Jo Cox, in this cauldron of bile  It was a crude attempt to link Boris Johnsons ldquosurrender rhetoric, the far right, and a racist murder, ashe were somehow morally responsible. Johnson didnt help by responding that the ldquobest way to honour Jo Cox would be to get Brexit done. That was patently absurd, tasteless and inappropriate.But the reaction was even more hysterical. Youd have thought hed actually called for more MPs to be murdered. The Labour MP Jess Phillips accosted the Prime Minister in the lobby, demanding that he apologise for saying it was \"humbug to claim that his use of ldquoSurrender Act was an incitement to violence. Really  Apologise for using the word ldquohumbug This is how stupid, tangential rows erupt on social media ndash where everyone you disagree with becomes a fascist, and people get drunk on synthetic outrage. They all need to get a grip dial down the rhetoric stop playing to the Twitter gallery.Im tempted to suggest calling Lady Hale, the Spider Woman, along to sort this mess out. The -year-old president of the Supreme Court became an unlikely superhero last week after she unprorogued parliament and ruled that the PM had acted unlawfully. But shes a judge, who lives in the rarefied atmosphere of the Inns of Court, not the Commons bear pit.We dont yet know the full implications of last weeks Supreme Court ruling, except that they will profound. It amounted to, as the former Supreme Court judge, Lord Sumption, put it: ldquoa revolution. This is because the court ruled on whether the government had acted with ldquoreasonable justication in suspending parliament for five weeks. It may sound odd, but no one has expected governments to behave reasonably before.The English High Court had earlier ruled that the courts had no right to get involved in policy, and that was what most people believed. Butjudges are going to get involved in detailed political decision-making, then the Supreme Court will itself become politicised. It already is. There are calls for its judges to be subject to political vetting, as in America.Labour MPs and supporters were jubilant after Lady Hales ruling. But they may not be celebrating when Labour are next in government. They may find courts questioning policies like nationalisation and the abolition of private schools. Radical parties of the Left generally have more to fear from judicial activism than Conservatives. As do nationalists. Look at Catalonia, where politicians really are in jail because the Spanish supreme court ruled an independence referendum illegal. Couldnt happen here  Im beginning to wonder.But thats all for the future. The immediate problem is how this wretched Brexit crisis is to be resolved before real warfare breaks out. We should be thankful, perhaps, that the only punches thrown so far have been verbal ones. We havent yet had any Gilet Jaunes-style civil disobedience and rioting. But the country is on a kne edge and it is the duty of parliament to deal with this crisis, not become part of it.The Prime Minister has a majority of minus , has behaved unlawfully, and is refusing to honour the Benn Act, which requires him to ask for a third extension of Article . Former PM John Major has warned that Mr Johnson might resort to jiggery pokery in the Privy Council to overturn the Benn Act. He is anyway refusing to sign what he calls the ldquosurrender letter to Brussels.The rebel alliance, led by the brilliant SNP MP Joanna Cherry QChave their own solution. Cherry has filed a legal challenge under what is called ldquoNobile Officium ndash a legal device that allows the Court of Session in Edinburgh to sign and send the letter to Brussels on the Prime Ministers behalf.Theres nothing like it in English law. So why would a Scottish court interfere  Well, as it happens, rulings of Scottish courts apply across the entire UK, as a consequence of the Act of Union. The Government could appeal, of course, and the matter could end up back in the Supreme Court. Lady Hale is no doubt sharpening her quill pen as we speak.Nobile Officium is ingenious, but it would surely be all Dominic Cum-mings Christmases coming at once. The idea of Scottish judges signing away British sovereignty, as he might put it, and reversing the Brexit referendum, as he would also put it, would be an ideal curtain-raiser for a General Election. The people versus the Establishment.It would also get Boris Johnson off the hook of having to actually sign the ldquosurrender missive. Instead, he might just make clear to the European Union, that he will not cooperate. He will not appoint a British EU Commissioner, will not discuss the financial implications, will empty-chair summits. Parliament can force Boris Johnson to ask for an extension, but it cant force him to do so in good faith.MPs have one obvious solution: which is to get rid of him by a vote of No Confidence. Put this zombie administration out of its misery. This wouldnt mean that Boris gets to call his early General Election, as many people seem to believe. The Commons has  days to chose a caretaker administration, and negotiate the extension themselves. But MPs cant seem to agree even on this.It is partly because the parties are hopelessly ided over Brexit ndash having voted against Mays deal, a referendum, or revoking A, the lot. But they must take back control,they want to be sure of avoiding a No Deal Brexit. Judges cant do it. Parliament cant do it. Only a government can conduct negotiations with foreign powers. MPs have the power to replace Boris Johnson tomorrow. Its time."},{"url":null,"title":"life-dredge-saving-seabeds-norwegian-kosystem-way","story":"Stinson had often tried to explain to others the loss of le he had witnessed from our seabeds in recent decades. When he did, he would sometimes wish he had a ldquobefore photograph of a pristine never-dredged bed. What he found and photographed in Norway ndash though dferent in texture from the Scottish seabed of his memories ndash seemed almost like that. ldquoI say to a lot of people, Irsquod like to show you a lsquobeforersquo and lsquoafterrsquo, but on the west coast of Scotland therersquos no area that shows lsquobeforersquo, he says. ldquoEvery inch in the sort of grounds where the scallops are has been towed over  times by dredgers and bottom trawlers.At first, Stinson was unaware of Norwegian restrictions around dredging and trawling and wasnrsquot sure why their seabed should be so dferent to ours. ldquoIt was only when I saw a set of scallop dredging gear and somebody said it had never been used because it had been prohibited that I started asking more, he says.The Norwegian government has prohibited scallop dredging and bottom trawling within  nautical miles of the shore, with some exceptions. Such restrictions werenrsquot put in place for conservation reasons ndash but to manage what are called ldquogear conflicts, between those towing mobile gear and others with static nets.Norway also has a  Marine Resources Act, at the heart of which, according to Per Sandberg of the Norwegian fisheries agency Fiskeridirektoratet, is ldquoan ecosystems approach to fisheries, as well as a ldquoprecautionary one.ldquoIn general, we are concerned that the fishery should not harm the environment, he explains. ldquoIn the s and s, there wasnrsquot too much concern that we were fishing too much ndash the idea was that the ocean was plentul. But then, suddenly, we got the collapse of herring. It took us  years to regain stock. One lesson learned: you need to manage the resources.Stinson rails against the use of ldquomobile gear, a term for dredging and trawling equipment towed behind a boat, which in Scotland can be used right up to the shoreline. ldquoThe most damaging, he says, ldquois the scallop dredge with its teeth and heavy metal bar that digs into the seabed.Since that  visit to Norway, Stinson has been back many times, in a bid not just to fish but to find out what we can learn about how we should be managing our fisheries. Armed with a GoPro camera, he has taken hours of underwater footage and interviewed fishermen, restaurant owners, fish processors and bureaucrats.Among them is Jim Lorentsen, who has owned a fishing boat for  years and talks of how good the fishing is right now. ldquoWe get good prices and a lot of fish, he says. ldquoIt wasnrsquot always like this. In the early s and s it was really bad. They hadnrsquot regulation of the fishing so they used to fish and fish until it stopped. Itrsquos unbelievable how much more fish we see now.Or there is Alf Roald Saeligtre, who runs Cornelius, a destination fish restaurant outside Bergen. ldquoThe main thing here is that we have nobody destroying the seabed, he says. ldquoThey are not allowed to dredge ... The whole approach is ecosystem-based. The last two years in Norway, in the north, we have been beating records. We are fishing extraordinary amounts of cod for fish and chips to England.Stinson says: ldquoMy campaign is to get somebody to acknowledge that the Norwegians have done what we need to do and itrsquos been to the benefit of the coastal communities. One fisherman said lsquoThis is great for us. There are  people on the island of Nesoslashy and  are employed on fishing boats.rsquoHe believes that part of the Norway fish stocks improvement is down to their seabed protection. ldquoResearch supports the idea that the seabeds are crucial habitats in some of the le stages of our larger commercial fish, he points out. ldquoBut in Scotland wersquore destroying spawning grounds. Thatrsquos probably one of the reasons why the herring are not ing. People will say therersquos nothing wrong with scallop dredging, it just needs proper management ndash no it doesnrsquot, it just needs totally eradicated.The research he refers to includes a study by Dr Sophie Elliott linking cod, haddock and whiting survival to seabed bioersity. Itrsquos particularly relevant given last weekrsquos news that, following warnings about precarious cod stock levels, the Marine Stewardship Councilhas removed its blue tick on North Sea cod.Stinson is just one of an older generation of ers who are witnesses to what decades of scallop dredging and bottom trawling have done to the Scottish seabed. His early years of ing were done in the wake of the lting in  of the three-mile limit which prohibited dredgers and trawlers from round our coastlines.But ers are not alone in having such concern. Nick Underdown, of the campaign group Open Seas, believes the government must urgently adopt a precautionary, seaward limit approach that protects the entire coastal zone, similar to the Norwegian one. He observes: ldquoScallop dredging and bottom trawling are regarded as the most damaging fisheries in Europe and yet they continue to have a widespread footprint in Scotlandrsquos inshore waters, suppressing the recovery of our collapsed inshore fish stocks.ldquoThe Scottish Governmentrsquos review of these fisheries must account for the damage done to our coastal seabed over the past  years, not just protect a few small areas. By restricting trawlers and dredgers in inshore waters, these businesses would be able to continue in deeper waters, while creating a massive opportunity for low-impact fishing and increase the number of better-paid jobs in the inshore.Alistair Sinclair, national co-ordinator for the Scottish Creel Fishermenrsquos Federation, has long campaigned for aof the three-mile limit. He points to a Scottish Government graph of the drop-off in fish stocks in the Clyde in the period following it. ldquoThe fish stock levels were reasonably healthy in the Clyde and in a short space of time ndash  years ndash they were at ground zero.Sinclair dramatically compares what has been done to our seabed to the ldquorecent burning of the Amazon forest. ldquoThe decimation that actually has gone on and the degradation on the seabed is unbelievable, unforgivable.But, as Elspeth Macdonald, chief executive of the Scottish Fisheries Federation says, this is a signicant industry, approaching pound million in value, with many jobs attached. She points out that only % of these are hand-ed and that the vast majority ldquois met through scallops landed from areas that have been fished for many years and that remain productive, so itrsquos clear that that there is room for both types of fishing.Macdonald adds: ldquoThe industry is working through the Scallop Industry Consultative Group on management proposals that cover a number of measures, including licensing. We fully recognise the importance of protecting sensitive marine species, habitats and features, and work closely with government and other stakeholders on issues including evidence-based Marine Protected Areas , and the development of appropriate management measures within MPAs.Stinson, however, wants to see an end to scallop dredging ndash although not immediately. Having worked on a couple of scallop dredgers, he is sympathetic to the fishermen who fear such an abrupt assault on their livelihoods. ldquoI donrsquot think they need to be put out of business overnight. I think it needs to be managed over  years, to shut it down. I would say we need to declare a moratorium on the further issuing of any scallop licensing ndash so no further boats.What he discovered in Norway, he believes, indicates that such measures would, far from being bad for our industry,it to its vibrancy. ldquoMobile-gear defenders always say we couldnrsquot compensate for the jobs which would be lostdredging was banned, but they have themselves destroyed the jobs of others by their destructive practice. As scallop dredging declines you would see a rise in other populations and other types of fishing would become economically possible.Why our North Sea cod is off the menu. The North Sea cod fishery was given its blue sustainability label too early. When, in , the MSC awarded it sustainability status there were actually fewer fish than the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea had calculated. Stocks had not fully recovered. As Robin Cook of the University of Strathclyde put it in an article in The Conversation this week, ldquoNow ICES has revised its earlier estimates, showing that the cod recovery plan should never have been abandoned.\". We need to pay more attention to cod habitats.The seabed really does matter for a species which inhabits inshore areas during their le, commercial inshore species like cod. Dr Sophie Elliott, lead author on a University of Glasgow study which linked cod survival to seabed bioersity, observes, ldquoThe problem about the way we undertake quotas and stocks assessments is that we just look at the fish abundance but we donrsquot take into consideration their habitat, where they live. Habitat is one of the largest factors that effects species survival, so by not taking it into account yoursquore just looking at half the picture and you can have super crashes in populations.Essential habitats such as where the fish spawn and also their nursery grounds should be focus areas for protection and stock regeneration. ldquoYou need to be able to understand what these are, where they are, to be able to provide a greater protection.\". Climate-change is having an impact. Fish species are migrating north."},{"url":null,"title":"POLITICS WATCH  Nothing like a dame to perk up this panto","story":"The Andrew Marr Show chose the latter strategy. It is dficult to see why. A time limit on the interview might have been part of the deal with Downing Street, but the beauty of a live programme is that things can changeneed be. Marrs interview with Boris Johnson was just reaching a critical juncture when the show segued to a pre-recorded interview with Dame Helen Mirren about Catherine the Great .Granted, viewers might have been looking forward to hearing from Dame Helen, but the segment could have been included in a longer version of the programme placed on iPlayer. Yes, the PMrsquos minders would likely have moanedthe interview overran, and it is not quite cricket to go back on an arrangement, yet as we are being constantly told, we are living in extraordinary times.As for the interview with Angela Rayner, Shadow Education Secretary, it could be justied by way of reaction to the Johnson interview. Couple of questions, job done. But we had her response, plus a rehash of last weekrsquos Labour conference story about public schools in England, and yet more speculation on what might happen next on Brexit.Was this a case of the BBC playing it safe when a commercial broadcaster might have gone for it with the Johnson interview and had the arguments later : PM says he acted with proprietyJust as these are unusual times, so Mr Johnson is an exceptional interviewee. That was made plain once more during his encounter with Marr. It was asthe BBC man was equipped with a water pistol, delivering questions in short, sharp, well-aimed bursts, and Mr Johnson was countering with one of those water cannons he bought as London Mayor and was banned from using by the then Home Secretary Theresa May. ldquoWhoosh! went a torrent of metaphor and hyperbole in Marrrsquos direction.It is a dficult style to combat. Interviewing Mr Johnson on the Today programme, Mishal Husain resorted to telling him to ldquoPlease stop talking, which he laughed at and carried on. Eddie Mair managed to get further than most by being icily forensic and not allowing himself to be distracted by the Johnson bluster. Marr did a heroic job of hauling the PM back to the topic on the many occasions he tried to break free, but even this was not enough to halt the tide of verbosity.The most newsworthy moment came towards the end of the encounter when talk turned to Mr Johnsonrsquos friendship with American businesswoman, Jenner Arcuri. The subject had been raised during the paper review. ldquoA lot of people are wonderingwe are going to talk about the Jenner Arcuri affair, said Marr during the item. ldquoYes, we are. They had to, given it was the splash in the Sunday Times. Plus, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn had criticised the show for not tackling a Minister about the story last week, when it broke.: Facing court again over extensionThis time, Marr asked several times whether Mr Johnson, as London mayor, had declared any links to Ms Arcuri given her business was in receipt of public money and she had gone on publicly funded trade missions. ldquoThere was no interest to declare, said the PM.Over on Ridge on Sunday, the Health Secretary, Matt Hancock, adopted a similar, nothing to see here, approach to the Arcuri story, saying that everything went through the proper processes.Next up was Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage, whose party had taken out a double page ad in a Sunday newspaper proposing an electoral pact with the Conservatives as a way to give Mr Johnson ldquoa big, workable majority. The PM later brushed aside the offer.Host Sophy Ridge tackled Mr Farage on a recent speech in which he said ldquowersquoll take the kne to overpaid pen pushers in Whitehall who had tried to frustrate Brexit. ldquoIt would have been better to say axe, he conceded, claiming such language was are more in keeping with political tradition.If Mr Farage was now the vocabulary police to Mr Hancockrsquos traffic cop, it has hard to know what role Jackson Carlaw was playing on Sunday Politics Scotland. In the face of questioning by host Gordon Brewer, the interim leader of the Scottish Conservatives was like the office temp who had unwisely picked up a ringing phone as he was passing. No, he had not been consulted by London over new EU proposals. Nor was he going to be drawn on whether the PM would have to resignhe did not obey the law and seek a Brexit extension, as one of his own MSPs, Adam Tomkins, insisted earlier this month. Nothing had anything to do with Mr Carlaw, but he would take a message and make sure the right person received it once they ed from lunch.: Hospital building programme highlightedAt least he did not add more intemperate words and heat to what had been a torrid week.

And these ground-breaking advances in communication and health, which we now take for granted, both ultimately contribute to our survival.They also work best in tandem. After all, what use is penicillinyou canrsquot call a doctor to make an appointment, orthe surgery canrsquot ring the pharmaceutical firm to order more supplies  As we face up to the climate emergency what we need now more than anything  are radical new and collaborative ways to live and work sustainably so that we and our planet can thrive.And we have them. The forward-thinking firms and entrepreneurs which Zero Waste Scotland is working with are already pioneering the circular economy ndash keeping goods and materials in a useful loop for as long as possible through reuse, remanufacture, repair and finally recycling to maximise the value of our limited resources.These pioneers are providing and developing a erse range of everyday products in innovative new sustainable ways, from lighting and computers to beds and beer.Tomorrow hundreds of leaders in business, policy and the public sector will join Zero Waste Scotland at the Scottish Resources Conferenceto celebrate and learn from these early adaptors. That second part is vital. Because we cannot create the truly circular national economy we so urgently need unless every single business and organisation follows suit, and does so fast. No matter how excellent their ideas and progress, the pioneers we work with cannot do this alone.Our huge consumption habit consistently causes the vast majority of the carbon emissions behind the climate emergency ndash so we need a national sht in behaviour. The traditional, linear system of making, using and binning products with little thought for the consequences has always been wasteful. And now the rise of fast food and more recently fast fashion is making that waste even worse.Millions of people now see the harm wreaked by our culture of convenience on endless news reports and documentaries on television such as the BBCrsquos recent War on Plastic.I doubt that legendary Scot John Logie Baird ever envisioned that the TV he invented would broadcast such shocking scenes.But Scottish wildle cameraman and photographer Doug Allan knows all too well the effect we, as people, are having on the planet. His award-winning work for BBC series such as Blue Planet has shown people how incredible our world is, and how blighted it is by climate change and plastic pollution. His powerful images have helped to fuel the public appetite for change which we have seen in the growing climate strike protests here and overseas.This week he will give a keynote speech at the SRC. Making that link between what we make, buy and often waste, the problems that causes and the solution which the circular economy presents is key. If consumers and companies join forces to change how they shop and work they can make a real, lasting dference. And not just in reducing the carbon emissions from all that waste. Becoming more sustainable will also help tackle a host of serious, related environmental issues from pollution to species loss.Over the next five years we are ramping up our work to help more businesses and the public sector find the best way to become more sustainable. What works for one firm or industry may not work for another. Revolutionising the way we design, produce and use everyday items involves complex challenges which will not be overcome overnight. Which is all the more reason why we need to close the loop sooner by transitioning to a nationwide circular economy much faster than we are currently. We wonrsquot meet the Scottish Government target for net zero carbon emissions by we move too slowly. We need to reach a tipping point within the next five years, so there is no time to waste.We have already shown that nationwide change is possible, however. Scotlandrsquos plastic bag charge reduced use of disposable carriers by  per cent within a year. Scotlandrsquos new depositscheme, urging shoppers to recycle their empty drinks bottles and cans to get their deposit back, promises to be equally successful.We have played a lead role in both schemes, which take advantage of peoplersquos natural inclination to avoid cost where that cost is made clear.Tomorrow we will publish a report suggesting that the same behaviour can be harnessed to dramatically reduce the millions of unnecessary, disposable cups which Scots use each year. That will help to inform valuable debate at the SRC as the Scottish Government considers the best way to address single use items. In just over  months Scotland will host the th United Nations climate change summit, the Conference of the Parties .That landmark event will bring world leaders here to agree the further action needed to combat the climate emergency. By that time we can, and must, be well on the way to making Scotland famous for the innovation needed to safeguard the future of the planet."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-delaying-general-election-not-enough-stop-no-deal","story":"The reality is that their current refusals will bring only a short-term postponement of the possibility of no deal, as whilst those parties supporting leave say their priority is to try to negotiate an acceptable deal, when an election does take place a no-deal Brexit will definitely be back as a possible outcome, at least on the Conservative and the Brexit Party tables.The Opposition parties must know this. So why really are they so determined on delaying an immediate election, however short and pointless that delay might be  An obvious answer would be concern at their recent adverse election polling, causing them to decide they had little option but to try to delay an election in the hope that their ratings would improve. Another reason could well be that they expect some ultimate electoral gain by embarrassing Boris Johnsonhe is forced to go to the EU, cap in hand, to seek a Section  extension. All party rather than country interests.If it is accepted that everyone is fed up with the continuing delays and desperate for Brexit to be concluded one way or the other, and that whilst no deal can be postponed short-term it cannot be removed, would the countryrsquos interests not be best served by the parties putting aside party interests and agreeing to hold an immediate General Election Alan Fitzpatrick, Dunlop.BORIS Johnson and Theresa May have failed to understand thatsomeone pressurises you to do something, then it is often sensible to accede to the request. First of all you can justy the course of action as being the idea of someone , and thenit does not work out the person who applied the pressure to act in a particular way can be blamed for the failure.If Mr Johnson really wants an election then the simple solution is to ask the European Union for an extension to the Brexit process. This would not be a U-turn by the Prime Minister, but rather a case of the Prime Minister graciously accepting the wishes of his opponents so that an election can be held. In the same way that a small boy retrieving his ball from a garden claims that it was a big boy who has now run away who did it, the Prime Minister can claim that the extension of the Brexit process was not his idea, but rather the view of his opponents and that by accepting their demands the way is now clear for a General Election, from which the victor will have a reasonable time to deal with Brexit.Sandy Gemmill, Edinburgh EH.LIKE Patricia Baillie Strong , I was disgusted by the unedying performance of the Attorney General, Geoffrey Cox, at the despatch box last Wednesday. His angry blustering and playing to the gallery of baying Tory MPs on the benches behind him shamed his professional status as a barrister and revealed the emptiness of his argument. He found himself with nothing substantial to say and turned it into impotent fury against the Opposition.However, should we be surprised  His behaviour merely emphasised the delicious truth that the Tory Government is now trapped and powerless and having to dance to the Oppositionrsquos tune. Whatrsquos more, itrsquos the Governmentrsquos own fault for slashing its majority even further by withdrawing the whip from  Tory MPs. A spectacular own goal.The Prime Minister has brought these troubles on himself by following extremist advice and deserves the consequences.It will only be a matter of time until he has no choice but to go to Brussels with his begging bowl and ask for an extension to the Brexit process in accordance with the Benn Act.In the meantime, I hope one-nation Tory MPs are becoming concerned at this uncharacteristic and dangerous extremism. I would not be surprisedmoderate Tory voters are considering desertion to the LibDems or other parties at the next General Election.Dave Stewart, Glasgow G.LIKE your correspondent Patricia Baillie Strong, I was astonished, appalled and alarmed at Geoffrey Coxrsquos behaviour on Wednesday. To me, his behaviour suggested that he is under some considerable stress and may have been pressurised to say what he said, and in the manner in which he said it, against his better judgment. It would have been closer to the markhe had said ldquoGovernment is dead as dead can be.Or am I giving the gentleman too much credit  It had the hand of Dominic Cummings all over it.Boris Johnson continuously goads the Opposition to either vote for a General Election or a vote of no confidence in his Government. There is one simple reason that they do not do so they donrsquot trust him nor his Government to adhere to the recent Benn bill. There can be no greater indictment on a Prime Minister than that Parliament cannot trust him.Willie Towers, Alford.Read more: Sturgeon backs Corbyn as caretaker PM"},{"url":null,"title":"andy-maciver-politicians-must-learn-act-normally-like-rest-us","story":"I voted Remain, in part, because I feared this. I feared that a small but influential smattering of my fellow Remainers would not accept the result. And I feared that a small but influential smattering of nationalist Brexiters would pursue a Brexit which would have worked for the British Empire but wonrsquot for UK plc.After last weekrsquos debilitating performances in the House of Commons, the received wisdom is that the fault for all of this lies squarely with one side indeed, with one man, Boris Johnson. Johnsonrsquos charge sheet is indeed extensive, and his looseness with language has a long history. His comparison of Muslim women wearing the Niqab to letter boxes and bank robbers was enabling language which one could easily imagine being transferred to the street. Equating the EUrsquos drive towards further political integration to the empire-building of Hitler and Napoleon was, as well as offensive to those who live with the memory of Hitlerrsquos consequences, not the way to win friends and influence the other side in an impending negotiation.And, last week, when an emotional Paula Sherrf, citing Jo Cox, said that Johnsonrsquos chosen language of surrender, betrayal and traitor features in the abuse and death threats directed at Remain MPs, Johnson replied ldquoI have never heard such humbug in all my le. I watched this live, and gulped. It was a dismal, dismissive way to reply to a question of that substance and tone.Boris Johnson is the Prime Minister. What he says and how he says it matter a great deal. He must hold himself to a higher standard, ensuring that the consequences which his words have are positive and not negative that they heal wounds rather than reopening them.Although leaks from the  Committee meeting of backbench MPs indicated that he showed some contrition, his fellow MPs and the country as a whole would have benefited immeasurably from him doing so in public. It would have cost him very little to say sorry to Paula Sherrf, to say that he made a mistake, to say that he adopted the wrong tone in that answer. That he chose not to has made us all a little poorer.However I must say - and I say this in particular to my fellow Remainers - you are throwing stone after stone after stone through the windows of your glass houses. For your charge sheet is also long as extensive as that of your Leave opponents.Because for every Leave MP we find speaking at a rally calling Remainers traitors, we have David Lammy MP comparing the Conservative European Research Group to Hitler, a man who killed six million Jews. And for every Leave MP we have calling Hilary Bennrsquos Brexit-delaying legislation the Surrender Act, we have Ed Davey MP calling Boris Johnson a dictator, which in the lexicon of most normal people would place him in a bracket with Stalin, Pol Pot, Mugabe or Castro. And for every Brexit-supporting newspaper calling Remain MPs saboteurs, we have Remain-supporting newspapers accusing the Government of a coup, which we are presumably to believe is on par with the Sudanese Armyrsquos removal of Omar al-Bashir earlier this year.Can we see ourselves  Can we see how emaciating this is  Can David Lammy see that, unlike Hitler, MPs in the ERG are not genocidal  Can Ed Davey see that, unlike Hugo Chavez, Boris Johnson is not jailing journalists and choosing his own political opponents  If they cannot, then they belong in a dark corner of the internet, not in our Parliament.This propensity to lose all ability to be reasonable and rational is infecting more of my fellow Remainers than I had thought possible. I have always enjoyed watching Jess Phillips on television. Shersquos so raw, so real, so relevant in todayrsquos politics. But last week, referring to the \"humbug\" remark of which I wrote earlier, Phillips said very directly that Johnson referred to Jo Coxrsquos murder as humbug. He did not this was a quite deliberate and improper insinuation, ironically during Phillipsrsquo own Urgent Question about the consequences of language in politics. Again, I watched this exchange live, and felt myself deflating. Phillips instantly went from being part of the solution to being part of the problem.The Speaker, John Bercow, was reasonable and even-handed in his remarks last week, when he said that fault lay on both sides. He was right. But the trouble with many of my fellow Remainers is that they simply donrsquot agree. They carry with them a moral superiority which guides them into the unshakeable belief that we are right and they are wrong. That itrsquos okay for us to call Johnson a dictator but itrsquos not okay for him to accuse us of betrayal, because wersquore the good guys and hersquos the bad guy. The ultimate irony is that, in the final analysis, this moral superiority played a key role in the disconnection between the political classes and the people, and the subsequent loss of the  referendum.We now must hit the reset button. In my view, this is more about the deliberate attribution of inaccurate thoughts or actions to opponents than it is about language itself. The language itself is primarily spin. For instance, claiming that the Benn Act is a \"surrender\" is deliberately emotive, but little dferent to claiming that a \"hard\" Brexit is a \"clf edge\", also deliberately emotive terms designed to make you think the other option must be better.Instead, at least as a first step, I would like to see the deliberate and  attribution cease. When Boris Johnson claims that everyone who fails to support leaving the EU come-what-may on st October all want to Remain, that is as deliberate and  an attribution to them as Jess Phillipsrsquo \"humbug\" attribution is to him.Neither side can pat themselves on the back today. Neither side should be going to bed sleeping soundly in the belief that they can hold their heads high. I could count on my hands the number of MPs who I could honestly say have the right to do that.It sounds hard even unachievable. But it really is not. All they have to do is act normally.

Disposing this total of  tonnes of material properly would be the equivalent of removing , cars off UK roads every year.When sent to landfill, food waste releases methane, a dangerous greenhouse gas many times more potent than carbon dioxide in the short term.By successfully capturing food waste it can be converted into sustainable energy, instead of being sent to landfill or incineration. The resulting material can also be used as a fertiliser for soil to help grow more food, more sustainably. Iain Gulland, chief executive of Zero Waste Scotland, said: “It wasn’t just fantasy when the Doc and Marty were discovering how they could power the DeLorean to time travel – they hit upon an idea that over  years later could make a signicant dference in how we combat the climate emergency.“Time is running out as we look to tackle the climate emergency. “The good news is that inedible food waste has huge potential as its energy can be used to make sustainable fuel and we can harness this by simply using our food recycling caddy. “You could provide enough power to watch the entire Back to the Future trilogy from the food held in nearly two and a half food recycling caddies.”Around  per cent of the , tonnes of food waste produced by households in Scotland every year is unavoidable. For items like tea bags, coffee grounds or banana skins, recycling food waste is a vital piece of the puzzle in tackling the climate emergency.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.falkirkherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"The public is being asked to look out for squirrels  both red and grey  for the Great Scottish Squirrel Survey. \"  \"  Join in the Great Scottish Squirrel Survey this weekviewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\" data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.falkirkherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Claire Gullan s to Banchory for her ceilidh workshop\"  Claire to teach “How to Ceilidh” viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"DEES | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"DEES | Article Teaser\"According to the Scottish Government’s  Scottish Household survey, only  per cent of Scottish households say they recycle their food waste, despite around  per cent having access to a food recycling caddy."},{"url":null,"title":"join in the great scottish squirrel survey this week","story":"People are being encouraged to look out for squirrels # and record their sightings # in support of the Saving Scotland#s Red Squirrels project.The Great Scottish Squirrel Survey takes place this week until Sunday, September .During this week – which coincides with National Red Squirrel Week – the public is being encouraged to spend some time exploring the outdoors while keeping a lookout for both red and grey squirrels.

This OpenRoaming technology is being trailed in the county as part of the UK’s most ambitious testbed for connectivity in rural areas, in a project that aims demonstrate the potential and practical use cases that connectivity could bring to rural businesses.CloudNet, is enabling Orkney residents and tourists to use Cisco’s OpenRoaming services across key locations on the island including the ferries, ports, piers, distilleries and libraries. The trial is testing how handsets can provide a frictionless connected experience for residents and tourists in Orkney. G RuralFirst’s public Wi-Fi access network in Orkney is the first of its kind to support OpenRoaming in a live trial environment.OpenRoaming aims to combine the convenience of roaming with Wi-Fi connectivity. Users’ identities are authenticated once before they can access Wi-Fi without needing to login or register again. By linking access providers such as public venues, retailers, ports and offices, together with identity providers, such as carriers, devices and cloud services, OpenRoaming offers mobile users frictionless Wi-Fi onboarding.“OpenRoaming will change the way we connect to Wi-Fi and presents new opportunities for providers in a world where we expect high quality ubiquitous broadband access where ever we go,” said Dez O’Connor, Cisco and project CTO, G RuralFirst.“Customers tell us that Wi-Fi onboarding is a major pain point and there is a perception that it can be unreliable and insecure. OpenRoaming will transform the experience of using Wi-Fi into a seamless and positive one. As well as improving the connected experience for industries like tourism in Orkney, venues providing Wi-Fi to their customers will be able to use it as a means of engaging with them.”He added, “This trial shows the benefit of seamless connectivity in one of the most complex, challenging environments. It lays the foundations for many new WiFi solutions as our most innovative customers and partners join us to develop access networks and identity provider services across the UK and the rest of the world.”Around , tourists visit Orkney every year, making it a signicant contributor to the local economy. By making OpenRoaming services available to tourists, the G RuralFirst project aims to provide a fully connected experience for visitors to Orkney as well as its residents. Furthermore, Cisco say that there is a commercial opportunity for local tour operators and cruise ships through selling Wi-Fi packages which leverage OpenRoaming and augmented reality tourist applications across the island.The technology is also being used to support connected tourism by promoting Orkney Origins, an augmented reality app developed as part of G RuralFirst. The app provides digital tour guides of Orkney’s historic and picturesque sites via tourists’ smart devices, at access points. Tourists are able to download the app on the spot through OpenRoaming, rather than in advance of arriving, and be guided by digital avatars, creating a more memorable tourist experience and narrating the unique history of the Orkney Islands.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Meanwhile, a council insider accused the local authority of failing to abide by guidelines for testing the memorials.A report to this Thursday#s meeting of the Council#s Monitoring and Audit Committee has set out key findings, and has made a number of recommendations for how the programme should be improved for any future works.In all,  recommendations were made — with six described as high priority.According to an official statement from Orkney Islands Council, key findings of the report were that:The six high priority recommendations were that:According to OIC, a further five recommendations have already been progressed — these are:Additional recommendations included:According to OIC, progress in delivering and completing the actions that have been requested will be reported to future meetings.Work to re-erect headstones in Orkney#s cemeteries is continuing with five cemeteries now completed, and one more expected to be completed shortly.Work will also be getting underway to identy and make safe stones where required in the remainder of Orkney’s kirkyards as part of a continuous programme of public safety over the months and years ahead.The full report is available here  # https:www.orkney.gov.uk Files Committees-and-Agendas Monitoring-and-Audit MA MA-- I.__Burial_Grounds_Memorial_Safety__.pdf.

Mr McArthur and Ms Wishart subsequently wrote to Abellio to relay these concerns directly and urge a rethink on the decision.According to Mr McArthur, Abellio has responded to say that it is exploring the possibility of working with a retailer to provide a left luggage facility as part of the station redevelopment. Both Northern Isles MSPs have called on Abellio to fast track those discussions so that agreement is reached on a proposed alternative before the current facility is removed.Mr McArthur said: “Passengers travelling to and from Orkney and Shetland by ferry, rely on the left luggage facility at Aberdeen railway station. The proposed closure will have a disproportionate impact on our constituents, many of whom are not able to carry around large bags and suitcases, while they wait for their ferry or train to depart.“Even at this late stage, we hope Abellio will agree to review this decision and take steps to minimise any impact on islanders.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It tends to be used in less high quality coffee, such as instant coffee. -- vw,vw,px, px\" --How does Arabica coffee get harvested and processed The ripe red cherries are either hand-picked, known as selective harvesting, or the plants are strip- harvested, where all cherries are taken off the branches either manually or mechanically.Once picked, the cherries are pulped, revealing the beans within. This is known as the wet method.The beans are fermented, laid out to dry in the sun and raked to ensure even drying.Any remaining skin and husks are removed during milling, before the beans are roasted, cooled and ground.In the dry method, the cherries are laid out to dry with the pulp still intact, and the dried outer layers are later removed by a machine.

What is Fairtrade doing to help Fairtrade will celebrate its th anniversary in the UK in October, after being launched as a result of the coffee crisis in the s.With historically-low market prices, the Fairtrade minimum price means farmers selling under those terms are protected and able to continue farming by receiving a stable, higher price.Those struggling to grow coffee due to increasing climate dficulties are being supported to stay in the farming industry by ersying into dferent crops.The Fairtrade investment is also being used to help farmers innovate and adapt.For example, farmers who can invest in concrete drying s are able to produce better quality coffee than those who dry the beans on the ground.And machines speed up production, when previously workers would have had to complete the process by hand.copy -.

Sinn Fein President Mary Lou McDonald tweeted: ldquoThe British proposal to reimpose a hard border on our island, as reported by @tconnellyRTE, is out of the question. It is further evidence of Tory recklessness and belligerence towards Ireland.Irish Labour Party Leader Brendan Howlin also dismissed the plans.He tweeted: ldquoLeaked proposals from the UK on alternatives to the backstop are completely unacceptable.

So when they retire the feeling of sadness is akin to a death in the family.John Humphrys of the Today programme was the irascible uncle, the kind who at dinner would be very likely to start an argument while grace was being said – but first thing in the morning his rigour and tenacity as he, metaphorically at least, pinned an evasive politician under the wheels of the radio van until the poor sap answered the question would set me up for the challenges of the day.: Jackie Bird reveals she has quit Reporting ScotlandFor unlimited access to Scotland’s best news, sport and expert analysis, SUBSCRIBE to The Scotsman website hereBut we in Scotland are soon to suffer a loss far more grave. When we bid farewell to this bitter and isive year Jackie Bird won’t be around to point the way towards a hopefully better . Stop all the clocks. Stop them around .pm on  December. Cancel Hogmanay!Bird has fronted BBC Scotland’s Auld Year’s Night shindig since back in the auld century. If Humphrys was the grumpy uncle then she was the whoop-it-up aunt in the sparkly dress, capable of embarrassing you in your teens with slobbery festive-season kisses, but who you’d eventually come to appreciate was a good laugh and crucial to every party.Well, the party’s over. Hogmanay Live is to be revamped – it will probably get a name-change – and won’t be hosted by Bird. Unlike Humphrys who has gone willingly and was granted a long goodbye last week and one final opportunity to rough up David Cameron, Bird had rather hoped to stay involved, despite having quit newsreading duties earlier this year. But she was only offered a ten-minute slot leading up to the bells in Edinburgh – “You’ll have had your black bun” as they sometimes say in the capital – and has declined. Now I can’t get out of my head the sad image of Bird trudging the streets on a broken heel, her carryout bag about to burst, as she peers up at tenements looking for a light in a window, flickering to the beat of Prince’s , the year she first presented Hogmanay Live. Oh, and she’s got Phil Cunningham and Aly Bain propping each other up behind her as it doesn’t look like the trusty duo will be part of the new-look show either.Maybe Bird hasn’t been your glass of warm prosecco these past  years. If that’s the case, then it’s typical of the complex relationship Scots have with Hogmanay. It’s summed up for me by memories of my mother looking out the Crabbie’s Green Ginger Wine in anticipation of first-footers on that specially Scottish night of nights – and at the same time my father bolting the door.Everything about Hogmanay is complex, including the black bun. It looks luxurious but after you’ve gorged on it you feel like you’ve swallowed a depth-charge. The idea of a gigantic party sounds great but before too long you’ll be stuck in a corner having zoned out of a conversation with a woman about schools – this is an Edinburgh party – but becoming more and more morose as you reflect on the year ending and the diddly-squat you’ve achieved during it.For a long time Scots liked being viewed as unofficial world champs at Hogmanay, partly because our dear friends in England seemed to struggle with the concept. But when that status became official and Edinburgh started hosting the biggest open-air rave-up on the planet some of us thought: “This isn’t us. This rampant exhibitionism, frolicking in the Firth of Forth and all that, isn’t Scottish. Let’s get back to drinking an estuary’s worth of beer in the privacy of our own parlours then sleeping off the hangover while everything’s shut for two whole days.”Putting Hogmanay on TV is certainly complex. As any film director will tell you, party scenes are tricky to pull off. The nightclub looks half-empty because not enough extras have been hired and when the party is in a house, actors can prove themselves surprisingly bad at dancing, though I suppose the glass heron figurines can be inhibiting. When the programme is live, the date is  December and the entertainment are pished, though, then you’re asking for trouble. There was one notorious show, Live into ’, where comedian Chic Murray “died” and actor John Grieve “corpsed” and a drunken reveller groped singer Maggie Moone mid-song. Actually there were quite a few notorious shows, presenting a portrait of Caledonia that we thought the rest of Britain and, by extension the world, wanted to see. BBC Scotland producer Iain MacFadyen was the master of these hoary heather ’n’ haggis-stuffed heuch-athons, earning him the nickname of the Ayatollah Hogmanay.To minimise risk Grampian used to drape country houses in tinsel and pre-record their New Year celebrations in August. But, you know, I reckon Bird could have coped with one of those Hogmanays from hell. I can see her smiling sweetly while Tennent’s Lager Lovelies cavort with men dressed as Lee’s macaroon bars and a flying caber knocks out the foremost authority on William McGonagall just as Simple Minds roar into a medley of their hits.Unfortunately I’m not going to see this. I’m not going to see Bird again on Auld Year’s Night and that’s a great pity. In a dignied farewell, she says she knows what’s in the re-styled show but won’t comment on it, simply wishing Beeb Scotland well with their new endeavour. Should the rest of us be worried  Perhaps. Much as I would like to be more like my mum, I fear I’m turning into my dad.

Its sole purpose would be to formally request another extension to Article , thus avoiding a no deal on October . Once an extension was secured, parliament would vote to dissolve and a general election called.As the leader of the official opposition, Jeremy Corbyn would ordinarily be the natural choice to lead any caretaker administration. But not everyone in the Commons sees it that way. A senior SNP source told The Scotsman that finding a neutral, “non-threatening” figure who could appeal to all opposition parties and Tory rebels would be a focus of talks.Anyone but CorbynWhile the SNP, the Lib Dems and the majority of Labour MPs are united in their opposition to a no deal Brexit, there are very real dferences over who should lead a temporary government.With this in mind, the Nationalists have reportedly already held private talks to try and identy an alternative candidate to Corbyn. “The SNP has no preference as to who takes charge of a caretaker government,” Ian Blackford told the Sunday Times yesterday. “We would, however, only support a person or party for as short a time is required to secure the extension and call the election.”: SNP pushes for a compromise PM to oust Boris JohnsonLib Dem supportThe SNP are, of course, not the only anti-Brexit force in Westminster. Since taking charge this summer, Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson has positioned her party firmly against the UK leaving the EU. The Liberals are gaining in the polls and harbour ambitions they could, after the next election, end up with more MPs than Labour to become the largest party in a loose pro-Remain coalition.But in the short term, Swinson is adamant the Lib Dems will not back any plan which would put Corbyn in power. The question is whether they would back a compromise candidate - perhaps a Tory grandee like Ken Clarke or a more centrist Labour figure like Margaret Beckett.The SNP think thatthe Liberals fudge the issue, it will play badly with Remain voters - and cement the Nationalists’ position in Scotland as the leading anti-Brexit party when voters go back to the polls.Election feverIt is now accepted by all parties that a general election will be called, regardless of whether a confidence motion is successful. While party leaders say they are focused on Brexit, they are also positioning themselves for the gruelling election campaign that will inevitably follow.Both the SNP and Lib Dems believe they stand to make gains at Labour and the Conservatives’ expense north of the Border. Being able to claim credit for avoiding a no deal would play well in certain constituencies.If - and it remains a very big , given recent polling - Labour was to emerge as the largest party after such a vote, it would most likely form a minority government, reliant on support from the SNP and others to pass legislation.Such a result would throw up a whole set of new questions on what price the Nationalists would demand from Labour in .The Conservatives, meanwhile, are confident that public anger over the delay to Brexit will sweep the party to power. They also believe that the political horsetrading involved in installing a temporary government would not prove popular.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"queen sought advice on sacking prime minister source claims","story":"The monarch reportedly asked aides for first time in her reign just how and when should could dismiss a PM.The Queen sought advice on the circumstances in which she could sack a prime minister ahead of Tuesday’s incendiary Supreme Court ruling, i has been told.A source claims that the monarch asked her aides for the first time for clarication on just when and how she could dismiss a prime minister who refuses to step aside.The alleged consultations reinforce suggestions that the monarch and her most senior aides had deep concerns about Boris Johnson’s decision to prorogue Parliament, even before the country’s most senior court was asked to declare the move unlawful.It was reported on Sunday that Mr Johnson phoned the Queen to personally apologise for the embarrassment caused by the crushing Supreme Court ruling that he had acted unlawfully when he advised the monarch to suspend Parliament for five weeks - advice which she was obliged to accept.: Johnson refuses to confirm he apologised to the Queen​ Constitutional crisisi has now been told that the Queen personally asked for advice on the constitutional circumstances in which she can effectively sack a prime minister.Under the rules of the British constitution the Queen can only \"advise, encourage and warn\" ministers. It is suggested that the monarch has sought her own advice on the circumstances in which she could dismiss a prime minister. Columnist Ian Birrell reports in Monday’s paper: “One well-placed source told me the Queen had, for the first time in her reign, sought advice on sacking a prime minister before the Supreme Court verdict.”Buckingham Palace said on Sunday that it did not comment on rumours.It is understood that while there have been discussions between Downing Street and the Palace about the constitution and the Queen’s role, it would not be the case that the monarch would take it upon herself to dismiss a prime minister or advise him or her to step down.However, i understands that any discussions did not relate to an active attempt by the Queen and her most senior advisors to sack Mr Johnson.: Why the Queen made an error of judgement on proroguing Parliament – Joyce McMillan Legal positionHaving been embarrassed by the Supreme Court’s ruling that the prorogation of Parliament was unlawful, it is likely the Queen would not want to be caught out again, and would want to know her exact legal position should she be approached by opposition MPs in the event of Mr Johnson refusing to step aside after losing a vote of no confidence.It is a quirk of the British constitution that the Queen retains a number of personal discretionary powers which include the right to appoint the prime minister and other ministers. A House of Commons select committee established in  that these powers also include a right for the sovereign in a “grave constitutional crisis” to act contrary to, or even without, ministerial advice.The Queen has been dragged into a constitutional crisis by Boris Johnson over decision to prorogue ParliamentConstitutional experts are indeed ided on the exact circumstances -any - in which the Queen could remove a sitting prime minister.In the event that Mr Johnson lost a vote of no-confidence in Parliament, there would follow a -day period in which MPs can vote to put forward a candidate to replace him.Drag out proceedingsSome experts believe that only in the circumstances in which it could be shown by Parliament that an alternative prime minister can muster a majority, the Queen could require Mr Johnson to resign.Others, however, argue that the Fixed Terms Parliament Act allows a sitting prime minister to recommend an election date after that -day period and therefore Mr Johnson could drag out proceedings in the absence of a clear power for the monarch to dismiss him.The Queen has hitherto scrupulously avoided the use of any of her discretionary powers unless explicitly advised to do so by ministers.She has also been careful to avoid being seen to adopt a position on any political matters. Consequently, the claim by David Cameron that he sought the Queen’s intervention during the Scottish referendum campaign has been reportedly the source of further displeasure in Buckingham Palace.This story originally appeared in the i. ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"tories say they are workers party with 10 50 minimum wage pledge","story":"Mr Javid also revealed that the threshold for young workers to begin earning the full statutory National Living Wage would drop from age  to .The announcement moves the Tories firmly onto Labour territory, with opposition policy currently to bring wages up to £ per hour by  for over s.: Analysis: Could the SNP be the key to Labour taking power at Westminster The minimum wage for over s is currently £. per hour.

But this week the #Peatbogs# will be back on home turf to showcase their energetic brand of traditional-inspired electronica as part of this year#s Skye Live Festival.The rare Skye gig will mark the start of another autumn tour for the six-piece group, for whom constant re-invention has proved key to longevity spanning almost three decades.The sound that#ll boom out in the tent high above Portree Harbour this Saturday will be far removed from the group#s roots as a folk band playing in local pubs. But the Peatbogs, like more recent successors such as Niteworks, are a reminder that a grounding in traditional music is no barrier to a letime of instrumental experimentation.Le for the Peatbog Faeries began with a gig in Edinbane Lodge in the spring of . Peter Morrison and bass player Innes Hutton from Braes # the two constants in the line-up # were joined by Davie Tait, Ali Pentland and Alan Edmunds.Pubs and village hall dances became their early staple, but gradually more adventurous elements crept into their set and the audiences lapped it up.Morrison recalled: #We#d bring in a blues or a reggae sound, and we found it was these things that started to go down best with audiences.#We moved to more of a world music sound around about , but we never expected much to come of it. We were just out to play at pubs and parties and have a bit of fun#.Their first tape # the #Great Ceilidh Swindle# # sold well locally and paid for a demo in Edinburgh, which in turn caught the ear of Greentrax Records, the specialist label in Scottish traditional music.With bands like Shooglenty and Martyn Bennett also arriving on the scene it proved a perfect time to be breaking new ground and the Peatbog Faeries# debut album #Mellowsity# would stay in Greentrax#s top ten for the next decade-and-a-half.Morrison remembers: #Because of our size and sound, bands like us and Shooglenty cost a lot more to record than other folk bands at the time. So there was a worry at the start.#But as soon as we signed to Greentrax, we quite quickly got an agent and we got sought-after slots at Glastonbury, Nomad and Celtic Connections.#We didn#t really notice what was happening, in a way # it felt like one day we were playing in the pub, the next day playing in front of thousands.#There weren#t that many precedents for bands like ours. Most folk bands just played in pubs. There were some accordion bands that were full-time or groups like #Silly Wizard#, but for us coming out of Skye we never thought it would turn into a full-time occupation.#We just went with the flow and luckily for us it proved a lot more popular than we thought it would be.#The band#s line-up has changed several times, and in turn, each addition helped explore new sounds # the most dramatic sht coming when Rick Taylor and Nigel Hitchcock arrived on Skye in the s to add a three-piece brass section.Taylor # who passed away earlier this year # was a revered musician who had toured with Elton John, while in recent years the Peatbog#s fiddler Peter Tickell left the group to take to the road with Sting.The current scaled-back line-up has seen Morrison and Hutton joined by Edinburgh-based Tom Salter on guitar keyboard player Graeme Stafford from Ardnamurchan drummer Stu Haikney and Shetlander Ross Couper on fiddle.For Peter Morrison, the global tours, the record deals and the Glastonbury stage all owe their origins to the chance he got to learn the chanter in the long-since closed Vatten Bridge primary school.He explains: #Every year Norman MacLeod # the teacher#s husband # and John Laing used to pipe us all in to the Christmas Party, so that was where I first heard the pipes.#Every pupil got the chance of learning the chanter at school, and I think nine of us started playing. It was either that or an hour of maths.#I think I was the only one who carried on into secondary school, but I got the bug. I didn#t like the competing part, but I enjoyed listening to the pipes and learning to play them.#My pal Donnie MacAskill from Roag also played the accordion, so I learned to play drums along with him and from about the age of  I was always in bands.#Morrison#s early piping tutor was Cameron MacFadyen, and he received additional help from Nicol Campbell # another well-known local piper and character from Dunvegan, whose memory has been honoured across the globe.Morrison added: #When he passed away Nicol left me his kilt, which has since been worn on stages in Japan, Africa and America.#A joiner to trade, who also worked for aperiod as a hotelier in Dunvegan, Peter Morrison has seen attitudes to traditional music change over the years, and with it opportunities flourish.He still lives in Roag with we Johan and grown-up kids Jenny and Calum, and it#s no surprise to hear him promote the virtues of free access to music tuition in local schools.He continues to be #amazed# at some of the local talent learning traditional instruments, some of whom he can be heard playing alongside at regular music sessions laid on in the Edinbane Inn and the Old Inn in Carbost.#It#s changed a lot since when I was a youngster whenyou wanted to learn music the only real opportunity was the pipes,# he recalled.#Things like the fis movement have been really helpful in creating opportunities. There now seems to be a constant stream of really good young musicians coming out of Skye.#When I started you would never have thought of making a career out of it, but now with some of these youngsters, it seems to be the only thing they think about. #A lot of these kids are now at a standard that in previous years only a handful of people in Scotland were achieving.#In Skye you have the likes of Daimh, Niteworks, Bridghe Campbell # the list goes on and on. #At these regular sessions there are some great young local players going along like Anna Scott, Dugald McKiggan, Archie and Isobel Maclean and Malin Lewis.#Morrison continued: #Recently over in LorientI saw a great act. It was a Sikh beatboxer, accompanied by step-dancer Sophie Stevenson along with Catherine Tinney from Portree singing puirt-a-beul.#This was another Skye person on the international stage, singing to an incredible standard, but she was someone I#d never heard sing before. #In the past, going somewhere like Lorient,there was a person from Skye on stage you would know exactly who it was # they would be an established name. Now you can go somewhere like that and get a surprise.#It shows the strength in depth there is now.#Some of that west-coast musical talent will be showcased at Skye Live this weekend among a ied line-up that will also include some of the country#s top nightclub DJs.Morrison urged the local community to rally behind the festival weekend, which this year starts with a Thursday-night concert to the Waterboys.He added: #We played at the very first Skye Live five years ago and are looking forward to getting on stage at the Lump in Portree again.#It#s an iconic setting, but organisers have kept the festival to a level that is comfortable for the place.#A capacity of , people is about a fth of the population of Skye and is manageable. When you start to go into the tens of thousands it brings pressures, and it#s a risk to go too big without the infrastructure to support it.#Whenever anyone organises a festival there will always be people who might want to pick holes in it or knock it in some way.#But people need to remember that these guys are putting on a  for so many types of music.#It#s something people of all ages can go to and hear some of the best music in Scotland in Portree.

Planning permission was granted in  and received approval from elected representatives on Belfast City Council having gone through all of the requisite planning procedures.The plans have been signicantly revised three times following consultation, resulting in a final plan which meets the school’s needs while making provision for extensive landscaped open space facilities for local residents.The sports provision as planned will occupy under fty per cent of the land available with the remainder proposed as a managed landscape development. In a letter addressed to FOGOG dated September , Mr Baker states that the project needs to proceed “within the approved plans”.“While there is no scope to amend the plans in these areas, the Department’s view remains that there are still a number of other areas where engagement between the residents and the school would be of great value.“As you are aware, a contractor is in place for this project and is ready to start on site.“As I stated at the meeting, it is the Department’s preference that this project can proceed in a manner that will benefit both the school and the community and I would urge you to consider the offer being made in a positive manner.”FOGOG have occupied Glassmullin green since August  when contractors, Haffey Sports Grounds, were due to begin work on the project. FOGOG have campaigned for the protection of the green space since , and described attempts to develop on the site as a “land grab”.De La Salle College have reiterated on several occasions that it has engaged in “considerable” and exhaustive “consultations” and modied plans three times to take into account the wishes of residents whilst still benefitting its pupils and “the whole community”.In his letter Derek Baker stated that there were four specic areas “where it will not be possible to make amendments”. Those areas are:•G pitch – following consultation in the earlier stages of this project, the size of the pitch has already been reduced. The current approved plan is for a m x m pitch, which is the minimum requirement to enable the school to have a useful facility for the delivery of the PE curriculum.School•Fencing – As you will appreciate, safeguarding of the De La Salle pupils is paramount, so the pitch needs a level of fencing. This will also have the benefit of protecting residents’ homes from stray balls.•Floodlighting – One of the key aspects of this project is that the pitch is available for community use outside of school hours and floodlighting is required to allow the community to maximize its use of the facility. While the provision of floodlights is central to the project, there is scope to review the hours of operation of the lights.•Pavilion – The pavilion is required for both school and community use and has already been reduced in size. It is simply not possible to further reduce the size of the pavilion and still have a facility, which meets the needs of the school and the community.However, in his communication to FOGOG, Mr Baker said that there are “still a number of areas” where engagement between the residents and the school “would be of great value”. The main areas are:•Hours of use of the facility•Sources of funding and the charging policy for community use of the facility•Landscaping of the Council area and•Nature of the G surface.Senior De La Salle College representatives told the Andersonstown News that the school “has always been and is still willing” to engage with FOGOG.“There has been extensive consultation on this project since it was first announced in January . As of September  the Department received an acknowledgement from FOGOG that they are considering the letter sent from Derek Baker and will be in touch in due course.“The delay on the project is costing thousands of pounds and this project will begin within the coming weeks.“We have made repeated efforts to engage, we want FOGOG to talk to us. Essentially these contractors have to go back onsite. This is a real passion for us. To provide this type of sports provision for the children, for the community.“It is important to stress that we want the community to be part of the management process of this project and we have extended several invitations for residents to join the Glassmullin Management Committee. The vision has always been co-ownership of this project and that remains as such.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"from educating rita to shirley valentine","story":", words of script could seem daunting to many a seasoned actor but West Belfast actress Tara Lynne O’Neill is sharing each and every one with pathos, poignancy and hilarity as she continues her storming Shirley Valentine at the Lyric Theatre.The Derry Girls actress was approached to play one of Willy Russell’s most iconic creations by Lyric Executive Producer Jimmy Fay, a part she had no hesitation in accepting.“It was a play I’ve always wanted to do. I did Educating Rita at the Lyric and it felt right to perform Shirley here as well.“I was waiting to get to that right age in my career and we went into rehearsals in May. There is something about Willy Russell’s work that relates to me and to Belfast I think the humour translates exactly the same. Both Rita and Shirley have similarities, they are characters who want more,” she said.The Fall and In The Line of Duty actress said the play still has resonance today despite being written more than  years ago.“For many generations women have been told their place. Here is a woman that says ‘well this is what I want and I want to do it dferently’.”Tara spoke of how she “couldn’t wait” to work with acclaimed Tinderbox Artistic Director Patrick J O’Reilly on the production.“I knew he would bring such physicality to the piece, I never wanted it to be me playing lots of dferent people, it has to be Shirley. Patrick’s take on plays is always a little bit to the left so I couldn’t wait to see how left he would go and boy did he go left,” she laughed.“Right from the off Patrick and set and lighting designer Paul Keogan wanted the set to symbolise many things. It opens in Shirley’s kitchen, it’s stark, it’s white, it’s almost asylum like. Shirley keeps it so clean so the symbolism of her writing ‘Greece’ in huge colourful letters on a pristine white kitchen is a really beautul concept that Patrick and Paul came up with.”She continued: “When Act Two opens and Shirley is in Greece, she hasn’t completely left her le behind, she’s only gone to Greece for a fortnight. Her surroundings have changed but there are remnants of her le back home still on the stage. Because you change scene doesn’t mean you have changed, that change has to come from you and I loved that premise.“At the end of the show, her husband Joe is coming over to see her and she is excited by that. Willy Russell doesn’t knowthey are getting back together but they are meeting up. The character of Shirley doesn’t blame Joe for anything that has happened – or didn’t happen in her le. They were both these hopeful people when they married and somewhere along the way le got in the way, everyone in a couple can relate to that.”The former St Genevieve’s High School student does not wear a mic during performances, which helps herbe “intimate with the whole theatre”.“The character of Shirley is a gt, I always knew she was and I think there’s a Shirley in everyone. People seem to instantly connect and understand her and that make it really lovely because then it’s just a conversation I’m having with  people a night. It’s a conversation about le, the script is poignant, it’s sad but ultimately uplting for everyone.”Shirley Valentine runs at The Lyric Theatre until October .

Spectators got good value for their money and I think this has brought Antrim football up another level.“It was a nail-biting finish – exactly like the last one, two teams who were highly motivated and prepared.“The dference I thought tonight was that no team was prepared to concede. The character of our own team was great because we were trailing for long stages of the match and I think both teams were a bit wasteful towards the end, but the main thing coming out of this was the drama.”Portglenone boss Barry Dillon believes the GAA should look at the policy of replays going to shootoutsrequired as it places unnecessary pressure on players, especially at club level.He was full of praise for the efforts of both teams who again emptied the tank, so this evening’s second replay could come down to who has sufficiently recovered from Thursday’s exertions.“The rules say it has to be decided, but the chairman stopped in and explained his side of it, saying that boys don#t need to be put under that kind of pressure,” he said.“I wouldn#t be for frees in the first place. A game should be won on the football pitch and not by hitting frees.“If someone was to miss a free for either team in that situation, it would be a big cross to bear to miss out on a county final like that.#You couldn#t have written the way it worked out – nine-all after free-kicks and the county chairman intervenes.#It#s great to be involved in games like that, seeing boys giving their all and the two games have been amazing.#Thursday’s game came at a huge cost for Lámh Dhearg as Pearse Fitzsimons was stretchered off with a suspected cruciate knee injury.They are still awaiting confirmation on the extent of his injury, but he certainly misses out tonight.Both teams have had little time to recover ahead od this evening’s third installment of this semi-final saga, but there will be no backward step from either as they aim to join Cargin in Sunday’s final.“We just have to go back and prepare properly,” added Lynch.“We#re up for it, we#re not prepared to concede and inch and neither are they, so it will be another great game for Antrim football.”All proceeds of this evening’s game will be split between deterMND, Paul McKeever’s Cancer Focus NI and Friends of Cancer Centre."},{"url":null,"title":"as a family we have given wrightbus around 75 years","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It is incumbent on the EU and the Irish government to make it absolutely clear that this proposal is absolutely out of the question.\"What we need on this island, north and south, is to ensure there is no hard border, that our all-island economy is protected and that the Good Friday Agreement is protected.\"The British Governments proposals fly in the face of all of that, and it is a vexatious and almost menacing suggestion.\"SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said the proposals were \"unacceptable\". “The content of these proposals fails to meet the British Government’s obligations under the December  joint report to avoid physical infrastructure, checks and controls at the border.\"It doesn’t matterit’s a mile, five miles or ten miles away, the presence of physical checks will create economic and security challenges that are unacceptable.“People in the North didn’t vote for this. We voted to maintain seamless travel, trade and le across this island. Exporting businesses, companies with integrated cross-border supply chains and frontier workers have been clear for three years that infrastructure of this nature will damage our economy with no conceivable benefit. That is the price of this twisted ideology and we refuse to pay it.“The root of these rotten plans is in London. That is the only place where Brexit can be stopped. We cannot continue to send MPs who support this madness or those who stand meekly on the sidelines. It is a dereliction of duty in a moment of national crisis for this island.\"Alliance MEP Naomi Long dismissed the proposals on social media.“These suggestions are totally out of question and represent a major breach of faith in this process,”the Alliance leader said.“Those of us who have expressed concern about the creation of new infrastructure have been taunted repeatedly by the Government and its supporters with the question of \"Who will build it  We won’t.” Yet here in these proposals they are suggesting they are willing to do just that.“Throughout these negotiations, the UK Government was clear its intention was to avoid a hard border and theof any border infrastructure in all circumstances. It was understood any such border would see a reversal of many of the gains of the Good Friday Agreement and would signicantly disrupt the north-south economy and local communities.  “Moving the posts  miles either direction doesnt change that."},{"url":null,"title":"british proposals on border rejected by deputy irish pm","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

What about regulations on goods ”“For all the U.K. governments talk that they wouldn’t erect a border on the island of Ireland, here they are proposing a border as a solution to their #Brexit paralysis,” she tweeted.The British proposal to reimpose a hard border on our island...is out of the questionSinn Fein President Mary Lou McDonaldSinn Fein President Mary Lou McDonald tweeted: “The British proposal to reimpose a hard border on our island, as reported by @tconnellyRTE, is out of the question. It is further evidence of Tory recklessness and belligerence towards Ireland.”Irish Labour Party Leader Brendan Howlin also dismissed the plans.He tweeted: “Leaked proposals from the UK on alternatives to the backstop are completely unacceptable. The UK is well aware that a mass of new border checks, wherever sited, breach the agreement reached with the May government to avoid regulatory barriers to trade.”SDLP Leader Colum Eastwood said the reported proposals fall short of fulfilling the objective of the backstop.“The content of these proposals fails to meet the British Government’s obligations under the December  joint report to avoid physical infrastructure, checks and controls at the border. It doesn’t matterit’s a mile, five miles or ten miles away, the presence of physical checks will create economic and security challenges that are unacceptable,” he said.Separately, the Irish Farmer’s Association President Joe Healy said the reported proposal by the UK to install custom clearance centres’ at both sides of the border is not a credible alternative to the backstop.“These customs clearance centres’ are border posts under a dferent name. The purpose of the backstop is to act as a fallback in the event that a future trade deal cannot address the NI Border issue to the UK and EU’s satisfaction. This latest proposal is an attempt to put lipstick on a pig. A customs post is a customs post, no matter what is called or where it’s located,” he said."},{"url":null,"title":"do the right thing for the people of northern ireland smith tells party leaders","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

bpanews_cce-a-ec-b-ecdd_EmailParty leaders in Northern Ireland must “do the right thing for the people”, Julian Smith said ahead of urgent talks to restore powersharing at Stormont..pushThe Northern Ireland Secretary warned the public has seen the quality of public services “decline” and key decisions “kicked into the long grass” in Northern Ireland without a ing executive.He addedan executive cannot be restored then the Government will “pursue the decision-making powers that are needed at the earliest opportunity”, while also highlighting legal requirements on the UK Parliament to extend same-sex marriage and abortion to Northern Ireland.Speaking in the Commons, Mr Smith told MPs: “The duty to legislate will come into effectthe executive is not back up and running before October  and my department will shortly begin an awareness campaign to ensure that women and citizens across Northern Ireland are clear as to how we plan to proceed to regulate for these new legal duties.”I will this week work urgently with the Northern Ireland parties and the Irish government to do everything I can to break the logjam and to get Stormont up and runningJulian SmithMr Smith said the Government’s preference is such issues are taken forward by a restored assembly and executive, adding: “But to those who now lobby me and others in Government to somehow change the law, I say the only way for these laws to change and to be shaped in the best interests of Northern Ireland is for Northern Ireland party leaders to form an executive and to get back into government.“To that end, following frustratingly slow pace over the summer due to a range of factors, I will this week work urgently with the Northern Ireland parties and the Irish government to do everything I can to break the logjam and to get Stormont up and running because the time for that is now.“The party leaders need to show leadership and do the right thing for the people of Northern Ireland.”DUP MP Sammy Wilsonsaid Mr Smith has “fallen into the trap” by “spreading the blame” across all party leaders for the lack of an executive, adding: “The only party leader who is opposing and stopping the formation of the executive in Northern Ireland is the leader of Sinn Fein.”Mr Smith also said there is a commitment to introduce a historical institutional abuse bill in Westminster “by the end of the year” in the absence of an executive.Independent Lady Hermonsought assurances on when such legislation would come forward, adding: “They have been enormously patient, they have suffered for too long, they have waited too long and they deserve compensation – when will it be ”Mr Smith said he is “confident” the legislation can be brought forward in the “coming weeks”.DUP Westminster leader Nigel Dodds questioned why legislation connected to Brexit and abortion law could be passed within hours, adding on compensating victims: “There’s absolutely no reason why this legislation can’t be passed very, very quickly.”Tory MP Simon Hoare, chairman of the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee, said legislation on historical institutional abuse needs to be worked out before Christmas, and warned MPs may not vote in favour of the Queen’s Speechit is not included.He saidhistorical abuse on this scale had taken place anywhere  “it would have been rectied and sorted out by now”.He said: “Unless there is a bill announced in the Queen’s Speech, my hunch may be that some of us would find grave dficulty voting for the gracious speech when the vote is called.”On abortion, the DUP’s Mr Wilson said the Northern IrelandAct  was “hijacked” by Labour.He said: “This billwe were going to give it a name as to its effect would either be the prevention of the formation of the executive in Northern Ireland bill, or some of the people in Northern Ireland who have protested in the streets over recent weeks about the most controversial part of this, see it as the kill babies in Northern Ireland bill, that’s the kind of anger which it has generated.”Deputy Speaker Dame Rosie Winterton intervened saying: “I do feel the use of inflammatory language is absolutely unacceptable.”Shadow Northern Ireland minister Karin Smyth asked what discussions are taking place in Brexit negotiations to stop “human traffickers and enslavers” exploiting Northern Ireland’s land border.Ms Smyth said there needed to be enough police resources to tackle human traffickers, and said it will also be important to make sure there are resources to support victims of human trafficking.She said: “These are victims and victims,we do find them andwe are able to support them which in itself is a massive , they do require a lot of support and resource, particularly around housing, and particularly around health provision and especially, as part of that, around mental health support and counselling.”"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38544780.ece/49660/BINARY/tenpounds.jpg","title":"northern ireland paper 5 and 10 banknotes withdrawn from

Time the EU had a serious proposal from the UK Govta #Brexit deal is to be achievable in October. NI and IRE deserves better!”Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer tweeted: “If Boris Johnson had spent any time listening to businesses and communities in Northern Ireland, he would know that these proposals are utterly unworkable.”The comments came after the Prime Minister said he remained “cautiously optimistic” about the prospect of a deal despite the limited time available ahead of the scheduled October  withdrawal date.He said the UK side had made some “pretty big moves” towards a deal but it was up to Brussels to respond to find the right “landing zone”.The moves came as it was was revealed that sexual and violent offenders will be kept behind bars for longer under plans being set out by the Justice Secretary.Robert Buckland will confirm he will end the system which sees some of the most serious offenders released after serving just half their sentence.The move – and a warning to criminals from Home Secretary Priti Patel that “we are coming after you” – is the latest sign of the Tories seeking to burnish their credentials as the party of law and order ahead of an expected election.As the countdown to the Brexit deadline of October  continued, the PM insisted the UK would quit the EU on that date “whatever happens”.Whatever happens, we’ll come out on October Boris JohnsonHe said: “I’m cautiously optimistic. We have made some pretty big moves, we are waiting to see whether our European friends will help us and whether we can find the right landing zone.“But whatever happens, we’ll come out on October .”Other reports said he UK was ready to suggest the creation of an all-Ireland economic zone allowing agricultural and food products to move between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic without checks at the border.And The Times claimed Mr Johnson wanted the EU to rule out any further Brexit extension as he moved to present a new Brexit arrangement.Chancellor Sajid Javid said he thinks he knows how the Prime Minister intends to achieve the October  withdrawal despite the restrictions of the Benn Act.The law was rushed through Parliament to require the Prime Minister to seek a delay to Brexita deal has not been agreed by October , orMPs have not agreed to leave the EU without one.But there have been suspicions in pro-EU circles that the Prime Minister will try to avoid complying with the requirements.The Chancellor told the BBC: “Of course, every government should observe all laws at all times. We’re taking a careful look at that law.”He said there could be no more “dither and delay and we will leavewe have to without a deal on October ”.“The intention of the law is clear and I do think it has absolutely made it harder for the Government to get the deal that we all want to see. That said, it can still be done.“It’s not about getting around the law. I don’t really want to discuss the detail of this law, it’s a pretty fresh new law, but we are also clear at all times we, of course, like any government, we will absolutely observe the law.”The Chancellor said he was not sure how much a no-deal Brexit would cost the economy in the short term.“I don’t think anyone really knows a full, proper answer to that question. And I have never pretended thatyou leave without a deal it won’t be challenging.”Conservative Party chairman James Cleverly heavily hinted the Government believed there was a way of wriggling out of the Benn Act.He told a Politico fringe event in Manchester on Monday evening: “Legislation passed in a rush tends to be bad legislation.”He refused to say how the Government could get around the legislation, adding: “What we’ve seen is parties distorting the parliamentary process, breaking conventions, taking a very creative interpretation of parliamentary procedures to prevent the Government discharging a promise the Prime Minister made and indeed a promise that all parties made at the referendum.“And I’m not going to help them by showing them our homework.”"},{"url":null,"title":"mackintosh property passes water pistol test","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The median age is under . Its a wonderful thing to see a new generation rise up and the first in my letime that % of marchers were women.\"I would put all my trust in the young women of Ireland to make a dference. I dont mean to be patronising but they are leaders of the future.\"Campaigns can rise and fall when the excitement passes but it is of the utmost importance that we stay on the same track because together we will save the climate, and world, for another generation.\"On Friday school pupils throughout the North of Ireland joined with millions of people around the world in staging protests.Some primary school classes, accompanied by their teachers, could be seen making their way to the city centre with placards carrying environmental messages.The iconic Free Derry Wall bore a stark message throughout the week. It read: “YOU ARE NOW ENTERING EXTINCTION ”, and encouraged people to join the environmental movement.By Saturday that message had been defaced by someone who scrawled \"globalist agenda\" underneath.The catalyst for the environmental movement is fteen-year-old climate activist Greta Thunberg. Last year she protested for more than a month prior to Swedens parliamentary elections by sitting alone on the steps of the parliament building in Stockholm.Following the elections she spent Fridays there demanding the government undertake a radical response to climate change.She has since inspired a mass movement supported by people, young and old, around the world.On Saturday Derry people continued to champion her cause by carrying placards reading, The Sea is Rising and so are We and We Need to Change the Politics not the Climate.Linda O Sullivan of Friends of the Earth told an audience gathered in the Guildhall that we are facing an \"existential crisis\" and people \"need to be held accountable\".And Paddy Nash, musician and environmentalist, sang a song inspired by the Save Our Sperrins campaign against gold mining. Amongst its lyrics: \"Whats more precious than gold \"The land, the sea, the air that we breathe, thats more precious than gold.\"googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh"},{"url":null,"title":"magherafelt based actor blown away role movie linked jurassic world franchise","story":"By Cathal McGuiganA Magherafelt-based actor has said he was “blown away” when he learned he had been cast in Battle at Big Rock, a short film thats part of the Jurassic World franchise.Chris Finlaysonplays American biker Greg in the film and aims to build on this role and some experience as an extra to land more acting roles.Battle at Big Rock was posted to Youtube on Sunday and had been viewed more than three million times by Thursday evening. Starring alongside Chris in the film were André Hollandand Natalie Martinez .Scottish-born Chrismoved to Magherafelt in , where he worked as a personal trainer. He said that his acting career really began when the opportunity arose to work as an extra on Game of Thrones.As well as appearing as a member of the Nights Watch in three seasons of the show, hes also featured in Superman drama Krypton and filmed sword-fighting scenes for the film Viking Destiny, which is available on Netflix.He first heard about the Jurassic World role when a friend tagged him on Facebook in a post from Louise Kiely Casting, which gave away very few details about the role.“They were looking for a biker with a flawless American accent. I just thought Id go for it and see what happens,” he said.Chris said that when it came to the day of the audition in Dublin he was “sweating bullets” and almost didnt go through with it.“Just as I was walking up to the door, I sort of freaked out. I went past it and I said to myself I cant do this just because of the nerves, because I wanted it so badly,” he said.“Then I was thinking to myself, youve come this far, you need to do this. I genuinely thought I didnt stand a chance as I knew Id be up against actors with more experience.”“I went and got myself two pints of Guinness, settled my nerves and went back. I was happy when I came out and thought Id done well but I thought it would just be good experience and that I wasnt going to get it.”A few weeks later the casting agent emailed Chris to let him know that the role was his, but he still didnt know exactly what he had been cast in.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“I thought it was probably some low-budget thing, but I was happy to get the experience and a few lines. To me, that would be a start at least.”Chris found a few clues about the production by looking up Jurassic World  director Colin Trevorrow on IMDB, but it was only at a costume fitting that he fully realised how big an opportunity he had been given.“They werent even allowed to say it but it was so secret,” he said.“One of the girls said to me that all they tell could me was that it rhymes with schminosaurs and I just knew. I was just blown away because Ive always loved Jurassic Park.”The eight-minute film was filmed in January in Co Wicklow, which means that Chris is happy to finally be able to talk about the role hes had to keep under wraps for months.“The weirdest thing is just seeing my name in the credits. Thats one of the most surreal things,” he said.Chris said that he hopes to find an agent in the near future to help him land more roles. He believes that a talent for accents hes developed from a young age can help him secure some great parts.“Accents have always been something that comes naturally to me. Even when I was only about four or five years old, I would talk to myself in the mirror and try out lots of dferent accents.”This skill came in handy when Chris played redneck biker Greg with an American accent so accurate that the production crew assumed it was his regular speaking voice.“Most of the crew on the set thought I was an American actor,” Chris said.“It wasnt until Id done my first scene and I asked someone what time it was, that they realised I wasnt an American. They couldnt believe it when I said Id just came down from Magherafelt.”"},{"url":null,"title":"mayor renews call back supporting people programme frontline workers","story":"The Mayor of Derry and Strabane has stressed the need for employers to “review their practices” and value the workers who are supporting some of the most vulnerable people in society.Supporting People Programme workers provide housing related support services, help people affected by domestic violence, those with addictions, families with child protection concerns, people in need of benefit advice and more.Earlier this year the local council unanimously backed a motion which recognised the work of frontline workers and called for an independent review into the programme, including terms and conditions of its workers.In a statement to the Derry News this week, Mayor, Michaela Boyle of Sinn Féin, reiterated the need to back workers: \"As Mayor I would like to voice my support for those involved in the Supporting People Programme, and stress the need to protect and respect the rights of frontline workers.\"This is an issue that affects so many people in the Derry and Strabane area who are dealing daily with the challenges of providing a valuable support service helping some of the most vulnerable people in our society.\"This matter needs to be urgently addressed and I would encourage those employers involved to review their practices and fully acknowledge the value of the staff delivering these much needed specialist services.\"Niall McCarroll, UNISON community branch chairperson said the Supporting People Campaign presented \"damning evidence\" to Derry City and Strabane District Councils Health and Community Committee.It detailed the outworkings of outsourced public contracts and the growing crisis within the Department for Communities and NIHE funded Supporting People Programme - \"a crisis which is impeding service delivery for vulnerable people and denying frontline workers the right to social justice.\"With specic reference to supported living workplaces, he said, the reality of outsourcing within the community sector is that some employers, unchallenged, choose not to value their frontline workers whilst garnishing a select few, who they deem worthy.\"The transfer of public services has many beneficiaries, however working class people are not included but rather excluded from benefiting from an honest days work.\"UNISON Community Branch activists are working hard and are committed to building a community wide culture of solidarity with regards the Supporting People Campaign and now with the direct involvement and support of the Mayor this solidarity focused campaign has become more dynamic and influential.\"The UNISON led Save the Foyle Haven Campaign began with the workers getting organised, the wider community mobilising in support and finally DCSDC joined the campaign through the office of the Mayor and collectively the workers driven movement protected jobs and a much valued and needed service.\"He continued: \"These are the fundamentals of any trade union movement campaigning formula, a blueprint for equality, integrity and the downfall of self serving governance.\"On behalf of our branch membership a UNISON delegation will now meet with the Mayor to deliver a list of human rights based questions, for both employers and all relevant statutory bodies to provide answers.\"The employers and statutory agencies will now be called in front of the DCSDC Health and Community Committee to engage in the UNISON led Supporting People Campaign as we focus on protecting the Supporting People programme and safeguarding frontline workers against corporate greed and those not fit for purpose employers who operate within this sector.\"The right of everyone to the enjoyment of just and favourable conditions of work is recognised in the United Nations International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, its time this same right was honoured and upheld within the Supporting People programme.\"UNISON would like to thank the DCSDC Health and Community Committee for the genuine support offered following the UNISON presentation to council and we look forward to working closely with them in the future.\"googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot

However, our initial assessment is that while this was not a viable device, it is clear that this is a component that could have been part of something more sinister.He added: ldquoWe know that the vast majority of people support our police officers and simply want to live in a peaceful society.ldquoWe will continue to work with communities to disrupt the activities of the small group of people who are intent on using violence.Slieve Croob Ulster Unionist councillor Alan Lewis said he was shocked by the discovery and praised ldquothe quick and efficient response of local police who sealed off the area.ldquoI commend the diligence of the local resident who spotted the device and altered emergency services, he said.Cllr Lewis called for a police investigation into republican terrorist activity in South Down.ldquoThe discovery of the mortar bomb on Thursday should concern every law abiding citizen of South Down and beyond, he said.This isn`t an isolated incident and is yet another indication of republican terrorist activity in the South Down area.ldquoI will be meeting with the PSNI next week to raise the concerns of the local community at the increased level of republican terrorist activity in South Down.ldquoI believe that there is a clear need for an increase in police patrols within the area and increased vigilance from the public.

By comparison, the plaintf has been estimated in the recent past to have a turnover of poundm and is the third largest snack manufacturer in the UK, the lawyer said.Mr Morgan claimed that a public judgment against the defendant would be more valuable to the crisps company than a prolonged investigation into what profits Candy Plus made from selling Irish Tayto.He also disclosed that his client was willing to make a pound payment as part of any settlement.However, the court heard it was being wrongly portrayed as a ldquoDavid and Goliath case.Mr Hopkins challenged the lack of evidence to back assertions Mr Ferris only made pound profit from the trademark infringement.Entering judgment for Tayto Northern Ireland, Mr Justice Huddleston said: ldquoI fully accept this case is not at the higher end of the scale of either culpability or breach, but nonetheless itrsquos a breach and for that consequences do follow.Awarding costs to the company and remitting the case to a High Court master for further financial examinations, Mr Justice Huddleston added: ldquoUntil therersquos an assessment of damages or an account of profits we are at a loss..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/25th September 2019 Doors.jpg","title":"Doors to close at primary school  ","story":"THE death knell has been sounded for Castlewellan Primary School.The beleaguered school, which currently has only eight pupils, will close by the end of August next year at the earliest.The Education Authority yesterday sent out letters announcing that it had approved a proposal to close the school along with its Moderate Learning Dficulty class.There will now be a two-month period for objectors to make their views known, after which a final decision will be taken.School principal Niall McLean said yesterday: ldquoIt is highly regrettable that it has come to this, but we have to face reality.The school, which has been in existence for  years, has been experiencing falling enrolment numbers for several years.The school has capacity for  pupils and of the eight children currently on the register, six are in the Moderate Learning Dficulty class and two in the P-P class.

Several of them would be subjected to severe political pressurethey made a decision to close on Monday.At the outset of the discussion the boardrsquos chairman, Mr Cecil Kirkwood, said he did not wish to open debate on the already widely discussed issue. The allocation of exceptional holidays remained a matter of departmental policy whatever board members might think inidually.Mrs Ethel Smyth said the matter was causing great concern in the area and that she had already condemned Lord Elton for the action he had taken in offering Monday as an exceptional holiday.Only a native lord from England would have made such a mistake. In her view, it might have been quite proper for the Roman Catholic maintained schools take one of their ten optional days holidays to see their spiritual leader of their church.In all but one of the controlled schools in her area good sense had prevailed and those schools would remain open on Monday.

Other suggestions included utilising part of the walled garden for public use, in particular, outdoor concerts.As council officials prepare to unveil the blueprint for the future of the country park, work is continuing to overhaul and extend the Education Authorityrsquos base in the grounds of the country park which is used to deliver a iety of outdoor courses.Several years ago, the building was earmarked for closure by education chiefs as part of a rationalisation of outdoor youth provision. But it secured a reprieve as a result of pressure from local politicians, including Rowallane councillors Billy Walker and Terry Andrews.Contractors are currently hard at work restoring and extending the facility which commands spectacular views over the country park from the front of the building and Strangford Lough from the rear.Cllr Walker, who for many years has been campaigning for more investment in the country park to provide an enhanced range of attractions for visitors, said many people were looking forward to seeing the councilrsquos future vision for Delamont.He said the country park was one of the best of its kind in the province and offered ldquounlimited development potential.Cllr Walker continued: ldquoIt is important that when the vision for the future is unveiled that local people are given an opportunity to study the document and provide comment on it.ldquoThe Education Authority stuck to its promise to invest in Delamont and it is important that the local council presses ahead with its own investment plan to make Delamont even better, capitalising on its huge development potential.Delamont currently operates a hugely successful miniature railway, cafe, stunning walks and childrenrsquos adventure playground, but Cllr Walker believes so much more can be done.He added: ldquoWhile I am not advocating that the beauty of the area is spoiled in any way, there are hundreds of acres of space which could be used to boost the parkrsquos tourism offering.ldquoSecuring finance to enhance the country park is critical to its future development and I hope others funders will join with the council on this issue..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/25th September 2019 Resurfacing.jpg","title":"Resurfacing work set to start in Irish Street  ","story":"WORK to resurface Irish Street in Downpatrick following the completion of a pound, public realm scheme is expected to start imminently.Roads officials have indicated that concerns about the state of a derelict building close to the townrsquos former police base have been addressed, paving the way for resurfacing work to start.It was revealed last month that the project had been delayed due to issues over insurance and that the work could not take place until these are resolved.Downpatrick area councillor Dermot Curran says he has been told by roads officials that concerns about the derelict building have been ironed out and that resurfacing work will begin.Work on the regeneration project was due to be completed by March, but it was the end of June before contractors finally moved off site, with traders in the area expressing anger about the impact the delayed scheme was having on business.The delay also had a knock-on effect on traffic congestion in other parts of the town as a result of the temporary one-way traffic system in Irish Street.Managed by the Departments for Infrastructure and Communities and Newry Mourne and Down Council, the scheme has resulted in new granite paving, street lighting and street furniture.The delay in completing the public realm work within the anticipated three-month timeframe was blamed on a number of factors, described as ldquounforeseen works issues, that resulted in the loss of construction time and delays in delivering the scheme.Issues which arose included the identication of asbestos piping along both sides of Irish Street which resulted in the works contract being put on hold for eight weeks. In addition, the foundations of the old blast wall at the former PSNI base posed construction issues for contractors.Cllr Curran said that while the Irish Street scheme was ldquobeset by problems and delays it was important to look forward.ldquoA lot of water has passed under the bridge since a one-way traffic system was introduced in Irish Street at the start of the year. While a number of factors delayed the project, it is important that work on the resurfacing scheme is now completed, he continued.ldquoIrish Street offers so much potential, both for the businesses located there and people who live at this very historic part of the town. The street has been transformed as a result of signicant investment which was long overdue.Cllr Curran said a new group was formed in July to oversee a pound, scheme to help revitalise shop fronts at Irish Street, with the so-called lsquorevitalisation fundingrsquo provided by the Department for Communities and local authority to help business owners improve the fronts of their respective properties.A working group to steer the project forward has been formed, with traders encouraged to come up with schemes to improve shop fronts.Cllr Curran added: ldquoThis is a timely initiative given what the Irish Street traders had to endure for the first six months of the year. It is also important that whatever schemes come forward that the character of this part of the town is retained.ldquoThere are also plans for an ambitious multi-million pound regeneration initiative via the redevelopment of the townrsquos former police base and a number of adjacent empty buildings.

He said:“I think politically it is a non runner because any Irish government that would acquiesce to such proposals, as part of an overall deal, and it would not be able to stop themthey weren’t prepared to acquiesce to them, well I think they would be writing their political death warrant ...”The proposals,accepted, he said would establish Ireland as the “source of pain” in the Brexit process, undermine the Good Friday Agreement and insult the people of Northern Ireland. But Downing Street is said to have insisted that it has no plan for such customs posts.Man shot in DerryOrange Order leader Mervyn Gibson: It’s wrong to link Irish language act to abortion issue

He said: “He was a fine fella. One of the best I ever met. We got on very well.”Ryan had been a Catholic missionary in east Africa but was back in Ireland working as a parish priest when the Troubles began at the end of the s.He said that he financially contributed “as much help as I could – some of it out of the mission boxes – to the situation up north” and then was “approached by some of the IRA leaders down here [to ask]perchance I could work for them permanently. They asked me to travel the world and try to get help for them.”Ryan eventually fell out with the church and left the Pallottine order in .That year he was instrumental in securing a five-tonne shipment of weaponry from Tripoli but it was intercepted before arriving in Ireland. He said that the original plan had been for a -tonne shipment but that at the last minute the load had been slashed by the Libyan authorities for reasons which were never explained to him.\"  \"  Supreme Court rules Boris Johnsons decision to prorogue parliament unlawful\"  \"  Jeff Dudgeon: If even Sir Anthony Hart’s inquiry into Kincora, the most rigorous yet, is not believed then we’re in a world of conspiracy theories Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"It was Ryan who realised that a gadget used in continental Europe to remind drivers toto their cars before their parking tickets ran out could be used as timers in bombs.Hundreds of the Memopark timers were bought by the former priest on the continent and sent to the UK or Ireland for IRA use.The fragments of a Memopark timer was recovered from the rubble of the Brighton Hotel bombing which almost killed Margaret Thatcher in  and did kill five others, as well as injuring more than , some very seriously.In a declassied government document, Margaret Thatcher was shown to have described Ryan as “a very dangerous man” who had “an expert knowledge of bombing” and had been the key conduit between the IRA and Libya for over a decade.When Mrs Thatcher’s accusations were put to him and he was askedhe was involved in any of those incidents, he said: “I would say most of them one way or another, I had a hand in most of them. Yes, she was right.”Askedshe was right to link him to bombs such as Hyde Park and Brighton, he said: “Absolutely – %. Oh yes.”When askedhe had any regrets, he said: “Oh, I have, yes. Big regrets. Of what nature  I regret that I wasn’t even more effective. Oh yes absolutely. I’d like to have been even more effective than I actually was.

Two-year-old Matilda Philpott who has Stickler Syndrome was joined by her two brothers, Oliva and Alfie, four-year-old Alice Haswell who has Goldenhar Syndrome camped out with her sister Scarlet, and -year-old Daisy Stacey who has Vacterl Association attended with her sister Molly.The weekend saw the families take part in a range of activities from archery, crafts and pop rockets to laser shooting, fire lighting, bush craft and raft making.The camp was the first time the referred children have been on a Scout Camp, something leaders have been hoping to achieve since the start of the group.Ruth Weltch, Group Scout Leader said: ldquoThe opportunity to regularly set up camp in the great outdoors is one of the main reasons young people enjoy Scouting so much and we wanted to give our children, who would not normally have the opportunity, the chance to take part in a weekend of outdoor activities and to sleep under canvas with their families.ldquoWe have been overwhelmed and humbled by the amount of help offered by leaders, not just from Cardf and Vale Scouts but from other scouting areas in Wales.This reflects the scope of the hospice itself which is open to all children with le limiting illnesses throughout Wales.ldquoWe have been able to give these children the opportunity to take part in activities not usually accessible to them and that we take for granted. It was an absolute joy to see them and their families take part in the weekendrsquos activities, seeing them smile and forget about their worries for a while was heart-warming.Lynne Phelps, from Ty Hafan, said: ldquoThe hard work, time and effort put in by the Scout Group since its inception has been truly amazing. The group has brought so much happiness to the hospice and given the children referred to us an opportunity to take part in activities with their families that they wouldnrsquot have had access toit wasnrsquot for Scouts.ldquoThe group has had a really positive impact not just on the children in our care, but also their families and our staff. We really canrsquot thank the Ty Hafan Scout Group enough.The Ty Hafan Scout Group was set up on the Scouting Centenary in  for any child referred to the hospice along with their siblings, parents and family, to spend time together having fun and making memories.A growing need for sibling involvement was soon recognised and so the group began to run regular sibling camps.The sibling camps have given the young people who have brothers and sisters in the care of the hospice the opportunity to attend events such as Scarefest and the Jurassic International Jamboree, as well as the chance to spend quality family time with their loved ones.ScoutsCymru gives over , young people in Wales the opportunity to enjoy fun and adventure while developing the skills they need to succeed, now and in the future.Open to all young people in Wales regardless of faith, gender, sexual orientation, race or social background, the movement encourages its members to do more, learn more and be more. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We want to turn them into respectful iniduals with good values and an understanding of issues across the whole spectrum le has to offer.The school encourages pupils to voice their ideas, and shape their own education to a degree. They are asked what additions and activities they would like around the school, push for pupil engagement with a range of le experiences, and emphasis the development of their social skills to help them interact with others in dferent settings.The idea works well in practice. The students are friendly, confident, and respectful to the teachers. They smile, wave and say hello to the teachers in the corridors.ldquoThis is my eleventh year here, said Ms Lewis. ldquoI feel privileged to work in Fairfield. Itrsquos a school with a wonderful ethos and atmosphere, and skilled staff who know the children well, ensuring theyrsquore getting the best possible.ldquoThe children really exude enjoyment and enthusiasm for their learning.One classroom was filled with children learning their times-tables by singing and dancing, grins from ear to ear. In the schoolrsquos on-site nursery, youngsters concentrate on their basic arithmetic, rolling modelling clay into a single sunflower, or a pair of bananas.The nursery is the most recent addition to the school, having been opened in January of last year. Itrsquos the sort of place you can hear long before you see, as smiling toddlers enjoyed their break time.The nurseryrsquos addition to the school site would allow for an improved transition for pupils from nursery to reception.ldquoChildren benefit from being challenged with their learning at an earlier stage, explained Ms Lewis. ldquoWe want to make them feel safe and comfortable at the school, and make it as easy as possible to move up to reception.ldquoWe also give our older pupils a chance to experience both Stanwell and St Cyres secondaries around here to give them a smooth move into secondary education.Therersquos plenty on offer at the school, as well.Opportunities for extracurricular activities is vast, with local community groups using the hall throughout the week, for gym, dance fitness, karate, football and music tech.The introduction of a lsquoMid-week Muddle-Uprsquo allows pupils to work across age groups on half-termly projects, which use staff expertise in particular areas for a project that they collectively work on such as working on the environment in their own conservation area, or lsquoPizza Mathsrsquo combining elements of maths and fractions with cookery.Pupil groups cover School Council, Sports Council, Creative Committee, Sgwad Cymraeg, Eco-Committee, Team Captains, Digital Leaders, while other groups focus on global issues and the impact of their actions internationally.Jake Kidby, Ahmed Maher and Georgia Tomalin-Reeves are on the school council.Though each had a dferent focus for their enjoyment of the school site, they all agreed they were very happy at Fairfield.Jake said: ldquoI absolutely love my football and therersquos loads of chances to play that here. The new gym trail outside is great too.Ahmed said: ldquoI prefer maths and challenges. We thought school council would be a fun responsibility to look after the school, help people and share ideas.Georgia said: ldquo As part of school council we decided to build a lsquorelaxation stationrsquo for anyone who feels down. They can bring paper and pens and books. Itrsquos just a wooden den. But wersquore putting in shelves, posters. And therersquos lot of free space to run around front and back.The school has been lauded for its environmental efforts, securing a Bronze Welsh Charter Award last term, and earning a Platinum Flag for their approach to ecological and sustainability issues.Pupils Isaac Eley and Sophie Wilford were at the schoolrsquos conservation area.They explained to me that the area was first started around  years ago, but they had begun pushing for more lessons to be held outdoors.They hope to add tables, chairs and more outdoor classroom equipment, so they can take lessons in the open air.ldquoThe staff go above and beyond here, said Ms Lewis. ldquoWith increased pressure on funding for schools staff, governors and parents have to really put  per cent effort in.ldquoThe PTA has raised an incredible amount for us over the years and have done wonders for our IT departments.ldquoParents have helped out in raising money for the new gym trail.ldquoOne father built our relaxation station shed by himself, and the stage on the playground for singing and dancing was also built with parentrsquos help.ldquoThey ensure we can continue and we can be excellent for all the childrenrsquos learning.ldquoAttainment is high and all pupils make good progress specic to them, and this achievement is something of which we are extremely proud.Therersquos an underlying feeling of positivity in Fairfield, off the beaten path but quietly proud and it seems thoroughly well-earned. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Yet, too many people across the UK ndash and here in Wales ndash are going hungry.It is shameful that in the sixth richest country on the planet people are struggling to put food on the table.A recent report by the South Wales Food Alliance has shown that  per cent of  to -year-olds ran out of food in the past year and , children in Wales are living in households for whom a healthy diet is increasingly unaffordable.In addition, the Trussell Trust has reported record numbers of people accessing its services. Last year, it provided over , emergency food parcels to people in crisis in Wales, , of them to children. A No Deal Brexit will be catastrophic for the countryrsquos most vulnerable households and would be an act of economic self-harm impacting many generations to come. This is why I am supporting the campaign for Food Justice.There can be no doubt that the causes of rising hunger are rooted in a decade of austerity, tax and welfare changes, and an economy that no longer provides a fair dayrsquos pay for a fair days work for too many.The food crisis that the UK is living through is likely to be signicantly worsenedwe leave the EU without a deal. The recently published government documents on Operation Yellow Hammer predict shortages of some fresh foods and an increase in the price of food by up to  per cent, as a likely scenario.The papers make for grim reading for the many hard pressed families who are already struggling to put food on the table.In Wales we are committed to eradicating food poverty but we need UK-wide action.The Co-operative campaign is calling on the UK Government to commit to zero-hunger by  and incorporate it into UK law.While many of the solutions to food poverty are the responsibility of the UK Government there is local action that we can take that can make a real dference.The campaign is encouraging councils across Wales to commit to playing their part by designating a lead member for food poverty, to draw up a food action plan, and to take inspiration from emerging community responses to food poverty.The good news is that there is a huge amount of work already going on in our communities by councils, churches, charities and food banks.For more information or to get involved in the campaign please visit www.party.coop campaign food-justice article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We have a long waiting list.ldquoWe have to make sure these are properties we have finance for and they are up to our standards as well. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This compares to five per cent of the population in , when  per cent of adults smoked.However, there has also been an increase in the numbers of ex-smokers who now vape.:The National Survey for Wales shows that, in ,  per cent of e-cigarettes users also smoked cigarettes. This fell to  per cent in  .Across the UK the number of vapers who are ex-smokers reached . per cent in  with the main reason given for using e-cigarettes being to help them quit.Of those surveyed by ASH Wales,  per cent of e-cigarette users cited health as their main reason for vaping.Suzanne Cass, chief executive of ASH Wales said: ldquoThe rise in the numbers of ex-smokers who now vape in Wales shows that many smokers are using e-cigarettes to quit.ldquoIndeed, when coupled with behavioural support e-cigarettes have been shown to be one of the most effective ways to give up smoking, enabling thousands of smokers in Wales to break a habit that destroys lives.ldquoHowever, with more than double the amount of people in Wales smoking compared to vaping, we still face a major challenge when it comes to changing peoplersquos behaviour and de-normalising what has become an entrenched habit in many of our most deprived communities.Despite the increase in the number of people vaping, the survey also revealed perceptions of the relative harm of e-cigarettes compared to tobacco cigarettes have worsened.Now almost a third of people in Wales believe e-cigarettes are equally or more harmful than tobacco cigarettes.Suzanne Cass said: ldquoThere is work to be done when it comes to raising awareness of the relative harm of e-cigarettes compared to tobacco cigarettes and addressing concerns about the safety of vaping.Since the survey was carried out, reports of a possible link between e-cigarette use and deaths from lung disease in America have led some medical experts to warn of the dangers of vaping.According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention many of those vapers affected had used products with liquids containing cannabinoid products.E-cigarettes are regulated in the UK in line with a set of European-wide rules by the medicines regulator, the MHRA. The MHRA also monitors adverse reactions through its yellow card system, which to date has not identied serious respiratory problems similar to that found in the US.Meanwhile vapers in the UK are urged by ASH to only ever purchase e-cigarettes from reputable suppliers. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We were a mix of young people, parents and other concerned citizens of Penarth, and met outside Grfin Books.ldquoWe joined the young people who have been striking from school. In a year this movement has grown from Greta Thunberg by herself to millions worldwide.ldquoThe evidence on climate change is clear. Our actions through burning fossil fuels and demands for continued economic growth cause global warming and climate change. People are already suffering and nature, upon which we all depend, is collapsing. Governments need to be honest about this and act upon the crisis.ldquoWe were over the moon with the response from Penarth residents, who walked with us or cheered us on, the day really gave us hope that the message is seeping in and change can happen.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It tends to be used in less high quality coffee, such as instant coffee. -- vw,vw,px, px\" --How does Arabica coffee get harvested and processed The ripe red cherries are either hand-picked, known as selective harvesting, or the plants are strip- harvested, where all cherries are taken off the branches either manually or mechanically.Once picked, the cherries are pulped, revealing the beans within. This is known as the wet method.The beans are fermented, laid out to dry in the sun and raked to ensure even drying.Any remaining skin and husks are removed during milling, before the beans are roasted, cooled and ground.In the dry method, the cherries are laid out to dry with the pulp still intact, and the dried outer layers are later removed by a machine. How popular is coffee in the UK Despite being better known as a nation of tea-drinkers, the UK has seen a surge in demand for speciality coffee in recent years.It has become one of the largest consumer markets for coffee in Europe.Recent research from the Allegra World Coffee Portal reveals that the total UK coffee shop market is valued at pound. billion across , outlets following two decades of growth.The EUrsquos Centre for the Promotion of Imports from developing countries says the UK is undergoing a ldquomajor sht from tea to coffee.Ground coffee and single-serve coffee pods are becoming increasingly popular, particularly among millennials, according to the British Coffee Association. -- vw,vw,px, px\"Coffee pods are becoming increasingly popular  --Where does coffee come from Vietnam is the largest developing country supplier of coffee beans to the UK, responsible for more than a fth of the market, according to the EUrsquos Centre for the Promotion of Imports.Brazil and Indonesia closely follow, while Peru is the sixth largest exporter to the UK, accounting for .% of the market.How is climate change affecting coffee growth Peru is the fth most-affected country in the world by climate change.The delicate Arabica bean is being threatened by unpredictable weather patterns, rising humidity and diseases.Brown eye spot fungus thrives in conditions of high humidity and rain and causes small brown spots to form on the surface of leaves.When berries are infected, they ripen before the beans are mature, and this can result in problems with flavour when the coffee is processed.The coffee rust disease leaves orange dust on the underside of leaves, causing them to fall off and preventing the plants from photosynthesising.In Peru, farmers are switching to lower quality, more resilient ieties or abandoning it altogether for more reliable, profitable crops like sugar cane, cocoa and rice.But even some of these crops are suffering as a result of unpredictable weather.Globally, coffee rust is present in all coffee-producing regions.By , up to half the land currently used globally to grow coffee could have become unusable for this purpose due to climate change, experts predict.A report by Fairtrade in France predicts that certain ieties of coffee could become extinct by , making coffee crops more homogeneous ndash and therefore less rich and resilient. -- vw,vw,px, px\" --What could the impact be With coffee consumption rising each year, the future struggles of providers to meet this demand and diminished yields could lead to rising prices.With more high-quality iants of bean failing to adapt to the uncertain climate, it could also mean less quality coffee as farmers swap to more resilient alternatives.The possible impact in the UK could be that coffee becomes a long-term luxury and quality will be sacriced. What is Fairtrade doing to help Fairtrade will celebrate its th anniversary in the UK in October, after being launched as a result of the coffee crisis in the s.With historically-low market prices, the Fairtrade minimum price means farmers selling under those terms are protected and able to continue farming by receiving a stable, higher price.Those struggling to grow coffee due to increasing climate dficulties are being supported to stay in the farming industry by ersying into dferent crops.The Fairtrade investment is also being used to help farmers innovate and adapt.For example, farmers who can invest in concrete drying s are able to produce better quality coffee than those who dry the beans on the ground.And machines speed up production, when previously workers would have had to complete the process by hand..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: How is climate change affecting coffee production  article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--Promoted Stories       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is hard to believe that this idyllic setting is less than half an hour from the centre of Belfast and the city airport.The accommodation is bright and spacious and has been tastefully presented throughout.Surrounded by approximately  acres and with its own private laneway, the original house dates back to the early th century. It has been added to and modernised over the years and yet much of the character has been retained. The accommodation is bright and spacious with lots of character and has been tastefully presented throughout. It includes: a ’” x ’” drawing room a ’” x ’” dining room a ’” x ’” living room a ’” x ’” country style kitchen a ’” x ’” conservatory a ’” x ’” utility room a ’” x ’” master bedroom with dressing room and ensuite bathroom a ’” x ’” bedroom with ensuite bathroom a ’” x ’” games room and a ’” x ’”bedroomThe layout will appeal to a iety of potential purchasers with the lower ground floor, which comprises a large games room and a bedroom with shower, lending itself to adaption to further bedrooms or perhaps a self contained unit or home office.The property is approached via a private gravel lane. The fields on either side belong to Lake House. The well tended grounds stretch down to a stunning lake which is a natural habitat to a host of wildle. A timber footbridge takes you across to the island from where you can look back up at the house. The original stone outbuildings, including stables and stores, complete the picture and make this an ideal home for those who have equestrian interests. Spacious conservatory with dining and living areasThe land surrounds the property and extends to approximately  acres. The fields are in good order and are currently let out to a neighbouring farmer for grazing.Viewing of this property is by private appointment.Agent: Michael Dunn Lake House,Adaptable accommodation

A signicant number of our employees at Hays have been with us for , ,  and even  years, and we pride ourselves on growing our own talent and promoting from within. Although there are times when employees leave due to circumstances employers can’t control, organisations can create the right conditions to retain their staff for as long as possible. We believe there are three key areas. A sense of purpose Across ages, cultures and sectors, professionals need to get up in the morning knowing that they can make a dference. No matter how big or small, recognising a clear and meaningful purpose in your role is a huge driver for staff. Communication is key for employers. By prioritising employee progression, offering regular feedback and communicating the wider objectives of the business, employers can ensure their staff come to work each day with a strong purpose. Variety each day While not every task can be exciting, and some parts of a job will inevitably be more stimulating than others,the mundane becomes the usual, employees will think about moving on. Injecting iety into each week and staying interested at work partly falls on employees themselves, who can proactively seize opportunities. But a good employer should also push their staff and encourage them to work outside of their comfort zones. This ensures professionals can keep growing and developing within an organisation rather than move where. A strong network The people we work with have a huge bearing on our happiness levels at work. You simply can’t stay in a role long-termyou don’t enjoy working with those around you, so the importance and impact of these relationships are not to be underrated. Employers can help their staff develop a network of inspiring and admirable colleagues from their first day by making sure they receive proper introductions and support contacts. Workers who have these strong bonds feel a greater sense of belonging which keeps them wanting to work in their organisation. With these three points in mind, it’s important to consider how someone’s organisation and role makes them feel, rather than just how impactful their salary or bonus might be. After all, this is what can’t easily be replicated across organisations and can keep an employee with an organisation throughout their career.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/catherine_1.jpg","title":"word from the wise kathryn collie","story":"Posted on Wednesday September  by Ulster Business How did you start out in your business  I followed the fairly well trodden path of completing my legal practice course at the University of Law in Guildford, having graduated with a degree in law from university in England. Before starting as a trainee solicitor in a City of London firm, I initially worked as a paralegal for three months in a law firm in Perth, enjoying the lestyle and dferent culture of le in Australia, and then spent a further three months travelling in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. After ing to London, I qualied as a solicitor and then spent eight years working in the real estate department of a London law firm. With two young children, we decided to move back to Northern Ireland in  when I joined Cleaver Fulton Rankin as an assistant solicitor. I have been here ever since and was made a director in . What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  As we will all be aware, the real estate market can be a bit of a rollercoaster. Having been involved in some fantastic deals here in Northern Ireland, largely courtesy of the peace idend, this all came crashing to a halt in . For real estate lawyers in particular, this presented a fresh challenge in terms of expanding client base and ensuring that our teams were kept busy. For a number of years I spent more time advising clients on restructuring, acting for administrators or receivers in selling off assets and working on refinancing transactions. This proved to be a huge contrast to the positive and very visible growth in the economy seen in the previous years. Thankfully, the real estate sector again currently seems to be enjoying good growth with high rates offor investors. However, it has to be said that the lack of political leadership here does still give cause for concern. How would you describe your management style  The most important resource that we have is our young people, so I hopefully lead by example and seek to encourage them. In my view the carrot is always better than the stick. What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I have spent over  years now practising law, butI could go back to university again, rather than doing a law degree, I would have studied history. It would have meant an extra year spent in training, but I think it may have kept my interest slightly more than lectures on tort and equity. Have you done it all on your own  No, absolutely not. One of the main reasons for coming back to Northern Ireland was, with a young family, we had the benefit here of family support. My parents in particular, played a key role in helping with child care at a time when I was trying to establish my career. I never underestimate the dficulties facing working parents with young children who deserve all the credit and support that they can get. A strong support network is also very important in the office and I am lucky to have the benefit of some great lawyers around me to whom I can turn to for help when needed. How would you like your business to be remembered  As a leading commercial law firm in Northern Ireland that is independent and innovative provides high quality legal advice to its clients conducts business in a socially responsible and ethical matter has a strong commercial awareness and specialist legal professionals.

Founder and managing director David Whelan speaks to Ulster Business about a business which boasts the right tools for the job David Whelan’s vision and mantra for what is now one of the leading telecoms businesses is clear – telecommunications services are only as good as the foundations on which they are built, with engineering front and centre. He’s the entrepreneur behind Clarity Telecom – a successful Belfast-based full-service telecommunications solutions company with almost  years under its belt, helping develop top-end connectivity – including lines, calls, mobile, broadband and cloud software – for businesses across Ireland and the UK. And for David, telecoms is all about engineering at the core of finding the best comprehensive solution to its customers, having the right tools for the job, and having world class people. For Clarity Telecom, it’s about developing a bespoke system for companies, focusing on engineering from day one. Since its inception in , Clarity Telecom has grown to have a greater engineering capability than any other independent telecommunications company in Northern Ireland, and is now rolling out its leading byphone VoIPsystem throughout the UK and Ireland. David also says through Clarity Telecom and its burgeoning byphone technology, the company could double revenues in the next three years as well as growing its workforce. “The phone network stops at a plug in the wall and from that point on, you have to provide the infrastructure and management,” David says. “What we do is focus on the engineering. It’s all about how well it works and adapts to your business. “By focusing on that we are looking at the way things are being built, and we can then get insights on how we can change and improve things.” Led by engineering, the Clarity team is driving change within the telecoms industry ensuring client infrastructure is fit for purpose and for the future. That starts with assessing a business’s needs, making sure the network is suitable, reviewing the workforce needs and bandwidth requirements. From there, Clarity Telecom can develop a bespoke solution – from cabling, to switching, cloud services, routing and phone systems. Clarity Telecom now has a team of  staff – a third of whom work directly within the engineering side of the business. But that number could grow further still, as the company expands its business across Northern Ireland, and develops its byphone technology. The company developed its subsidiary, Voxbit, in  – specically to design engineering solutions. And through that has come one of its most successful products, byphone. A simple to use VoIP , byphone is a drag and drop system that allows users to configure their own phone set up suited to the exact needs of the organisation and enables a range of analysis tools that can help business owners drive up efficiencies. “In  as VoIP started coming along, I realised that was a signicant opportunity,” David says. “Where the communications industry is going is into the cloud. It’s going from traditional storage within buildings, into something in the cloud. The traditional telephone systems are evolving. “We started making a series of innovations surrounding cloud technology. We realised you can make it simpler – we were asking ourselves, can you make it work without a manual, for example. “If you can, in the same way as Apple’s iPhone made things easier for users, people will start using the services. It’s about making everyone’s le easier. “The end user wants to be able to use the system easily, from managing their telephone number, to having access to voicemail. It’s about the ‘power of simple’. “We now have around  resellers for the byphone system in the UK, and we are looking at trebling or quadrupling those sales,” he said. One of Clarity Telecom’s customers is Mid  East Antrim Borough Council. The firm was tasked with bringing together the complex communication needs of the new ‘super council’ following the amalgamation in . “With bringing three councils together, one of the main problems was having a single phone number that people could call. If you have numerous sites, spread across three council areas, that would involve a lot of rip and replace,” David says. “But we gave them one telephone number and then managed the routing to all those bits of equipment across the council areas.” Hotel giant Andras House – which operates seven hotels and , rooms in Belfast including the Crowne Plaza at Shaw’s Bridge and the new Hampton Hilton – is also another major customer. “Businesses trust us to be able to provide the engineering solutions in order for them to run their companies,” David says. So, why should a business consider Clarity Telecom for its crucial and comprehensive connectivity needs  David says Clarity is all about improving how companies interact with their customers – making it easier, and thus, improving revenue and sales. “As you manage your telephone connections you become better at dealing with your customers – you become more efficient at dealing with them, and they will have a better experience. It’s about improving customer contact. “As a business you are able to do a lot more, such as listening to call recordings, access to statistics and using data which will help manage that contact, as well as saving on costs and making your business more efficient. “What solution depends on your business. That is where we come along. We never put a system in without doing a full engineering visit.” Some of the connectivity includes the ability to connect landline with mobile phones, call forwarding and being able to access voicemails as digital recordings, by phone or computer. “When companies deal with us, they can come along and say ‘this is what we are trying to do’, and we are able to work the engineering and infrastructure, before then providing the services,” David says. “It’s also about fighting against the view that it’s all about price. Yes, you have to be competitive, but you need the right infrastructure. For example,a shop loses connectivity for two days, then they lose two days of sales, simply because they don’t have the back-up for the credit card payment system. “It’s about getting businesses to think about the infrastructure and all of the issues. It’s not just about how cheap you can make a call. It’s about how customers can engage with your business – and we are at the heart of making that happen.” For further information, contact Clarity Telecom on    or visit www.clarityteleView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/con1.jpg","title":"us cyber security firm creating  jobs in belfast","story":"Posted on Tuesday  September  by John Mulgrew Alastair Hamilton and Alan Naumann A US cyber-security firm is creating  jobs with a new base in Belfast.

In today’s digital world every major company across almost every industry is building software to empower the digital experiences consumers expect. “As more products and services are procured, delivered or operated via the internet, the risk of security breaches by well organised, highly motivated criminals increases daily. “The new centre will include an RD team of software developers to help create new innovative products, along with sales and marketing teams to support the company’s European growth plans.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/redbus.jpg","title":"around  jobs lost as wrightbus enters administration","story":"Posted on Wednesday  September  by John Mulgrew Around , jobs have been lost after Ballymena bus maker Wrightbus entered administration. The company had been in talks to seek a buyer, with business advisory firm Deloitte being appointed. But this morning the -year-old family-owned firm has now entered administration. Around , of the firms , employees have now been made redundant. Unite addressed staff and journalists on Wednesday morning. The union has warned that up to , workers could be directly, and indirectly, impacted. Directors at the maker of the so-called Boris bus had been in talks with companies including Chinese giant Weichai and entrepreneur Jo Bamford about a potential sale. But talks broke down last week, with the amount of rent to be paid on the companys premises believed to be a stumbling block. Wrightbus, which was co-founded by Sir William Wright, has faced trading dficulties after a downturn in demand for its products. A spokesperson for the Wright family said: \"We are devastated at the news today that the company has been placed in administration by the Wright Group Board. Global changes from diesel to electric in bus technology have caused a sharp decline in demand for buses in the UK. As a shortfall became apparent, one of the steps taken was to move work from our Malaysia facility back to Ballymena to secure jobs here.\" \"These factors have resulted in signicant losses at Wrightbus which our family has been covering for over a year. This was undertaken to both protect the workforce and the engineering expertise in the company. It simply became impossible to sustain that level of support. \"We have worked hard to support the restructuring team based in Wrightbus, and we are confident that a buyer for the business can still be found. We would like to thank the bank for supporting the company over  years and in particular the last six months.\" \"Since it was established in  from a tin shed, Wrightbus has become a world leader in bus manufacture and technology, employing tens of thousands of people. The company has built a culture and tradition of expertise and innovation in the Ballymena area which is recognised across the globe. The production of the world-famous London Routemaster is just one example of the many achievements of the firm and we are hopeful that a new buyer will be found and that work at the factory can continue.\" Stephen Kelly, chief executive of Manufacturing NI, says \"news that Wrightbus has entered administration is a devastating blow to the staff, the manufacturing sector across Northern Ireland and particularly damaging to the Ballymena economy\". \"Businesses in the supply chain have been doing what they can to support the company over this past year in the hope the business can be saved. \"They to face some very uncertain months as they try to secure the money they are owed and replace the trade they have done with the Wrightbus. \"That wont be easy as theres a signicant cooling of demand across the UK economy as Brexit bites and buyers reluctant to make big capital purchases. \"The company have a great product and a very talented workforce. Hopefully the administration process will see the firm put back on to a firm footing. \"But in doing that, it is important to protect the SMEs in the supply chain.\" Michael Magnay and Peter Allen of Deloitte were today appointed as joint administrators to Wrights Group Limited, Wrightbus Limited, Wright En-Drive Limited, Wright Composites Limited and Metallix Limited. Mr Magnay, joint administrator, said: “It is bitterly disappointing for all concerned that despite extensive efforts over recent months it has not been possible to find a buyer who wanted to maintain the business as a going concern. “We recognise the Companies are crucially important employers in Ballymena, and this will be devastating news for those who worked there, their families and the town, which has already suffered from a number of manufacturing closures in recent years. We will continue to support employees through this dficult time. “The joint administrators will explore all remaining options for the business and assets, and would encourage any parties with an interest to contact them.” The Mayor of Mid and East Antrim, Maureen Morrow, expressed her deep sadness following the announcement Wrightbus has entered administration. I am deeply saddened by this announcement and the loss of so many jobs. “Following requests from elected members, a special council meeting will be held on Tuesday evening at pm to discuss the emerging situation.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/jo-control-room_.jpg","title":"m green energy plan for northern ireland","story":"Posted on Thursday  September  by Ulster Business Northern Ireland’s electricity operator has outlined a major £m five-year investment plan for a green energy system here.

The Top  Northern Ireland Companies  dinner, with AL Goodbody, brought together some of top business chiefs making the list, to the grand backdrop of Queen’s University’s Great Hall. The event heard renewed calls for securing a deal on Brexit, and the restoration of Stormont, as we approach , days without a devolved government here. John Mulgrew, editor of Ulster Business, told those gathered: “On the precipice of Brexit, the voice of business has never been stronger or more important – further enforcing the need for a deal. Avoiding a hard exit. And retaining a strong trading relationship across the island. “But we should also take this opportunity to clearly note, that we are approaching , days since having a devolved government – up and running. “It affects you and your businesses, and it’s cited as the key reason putting off investment from overseas, and our own local companies, from making key investment decisions.” The Top  edition is an annual showcase of the leading and largest companies, located right across Northern Ireland. This year sales rose by almost %, approaching a combined figure of £bn. And for the eighth year in a row, poultry processing giant Moy Park has come in at the number one spot, with turnover of £.bn. Michael Neill, head of Belfast office at AL Goodbody, said: “What the Top  companies have achieved in the past  months in what can only be described as capricious circumstances is truly remarkable – but imagine what could have been achieved had we some semblance of ‘normality’. “My hope is that we find ourselves doing so in a Northern Ireland that is embarking on a new and positive era of opportunity, rather than picking up the shattered pieces of a ‘no deal’ Brexit for many years to come.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
