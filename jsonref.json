It symbolised hope for many, a constant reminder that a person could withstand any challenge. The image of a man carrying an anchor, similarly, represented hope being carried through tumultuous, particularly difficult times. However, many convicts arrived to Australia with the anchor tattooed upside down, with claims persisting that this symbolised a loss of hope, and resignation over the future.          A traditional anchor tattoo (pictured) replicated on parchment The Anchor - nowAnchor tattoos are still a popular choice for millennials, often carrying a multitude of possible meanings. Many choose the image to represent length and commitment within a relationship, or to represent strength through adversity. It is still a universal symbol of hope, with one woman claiming that her anchor tattoo provides her strength through tough times.           Anchors are more commonly appearing in young adult tattoo trends          The anchor tattoo is a symbol of hope and strength The Heart - thenThe heart is a universal symbol of love, undying affection and lust. Many convicts had hearts with their lover\u0027s initials tattooed as well. Hearts  pierced by darts referred to erotic, sexual love.A bleeding, wounded or split heart may symbolise a heart broken in two. A heart skewered with a dagger represented betrayal or loss.          This traditional convict heart tattoo (pictured) has been split with a dagger, suggesting betrayal or lossThe Heart - now The heart is a strong and emotive motif that defies cultural, religious and social barriers. For this reason, it is still commonly used as a symbol of affection, happiness and joy, associated with the names of loved ones. The Swallow - then  The swallow had many connotations with the sea and safe travels. It was said that it was traditionally tattooed onto sailors to signify their sailing experience, but it was also believed that if a sailor were to drown on his voyage, the swallow would carry his soul to heaven.           Convicts often used their bodies as a canvas to tell their storyThe Swallow - now The swallow today is thought of as a pretty bird that people, young and old, enjoy getting inked into their skin. It represents freedom, lightheartedness - and most importantly, a safe return home.          Swallows are a modern symbol of freedom, and represent a safe journey home"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/08/16/4D0E263F00000578-5817855-Wide_receiver_Terrell_Owens_81_of_the_Philadelphia_Eagles_runs_p-a-5_1528472335803.jpg","title":"Terrell Owens wont attend Hall Fame induction","story":"    Terrell Owens #81 of the Cincinnati Bengals warms up before the game against the Dallas Cowboys during the 2010 Pro Football Hall of Fame Game           Wide receiver Terrell Owens #81 of the Philadelphia Eagles runs past safety Kim Herring #22 of the Cincinnati Bengals during the first half of their preseason game on August 26, 2005          Terrell Owens #81 of the San Francisco 49ers celebrates in the end zone after scoring a touchdown against the Dallas Cowboys with 12 seconds left on December 8, 2002 at Texas Stadium in Irving, TexasAlthough he has not revealed the full reason behind his snub, Owens said in his statement: \u0027After visiting Canton earlier this year, I came to the realization that I wish to celebrate what will be one of the most memorable days of my life, elsewhere. \u0027At a later date, I will announce where and when I will celebrate my induction.\u0027One sports writer concluded that Owens was \u0027snubbing the Pro Football Hall of Fame of his presence at the induction ceremony this year after being snubbed the past two years\u0027.

Among the reasons he fell short were his being considered a isive teammate and negative presence in the locker room.Still, he received strong consideration for the hall before getting in last February, along with Moss, another standout receiver.\u0027I think T.O. actually was disappointed when he got in this year,\u0027 said Paul Domowitch of the Philadelphia Daily News, who presented Owens\u0027 case for induction and has been on the selection committee for 16 years.\u0027I think he was happier when he got snubbed and could play the part of the persecuted victim and moan on every radio talk show that was willing to bring him on about the unfairness of the process.\u0027Maybe he was worried that he would become forgotten after the induction ceremony. This way, he gets his gold jacket, but still will be remembered as the guy who told the hall to go stuff it,\u0027 he added.Another Owens supporter in the hall voting, Jarrett Bell of USA Today, has been on the selection committee for 21 years and was \u0027at a loss to understand\u0027 why Owens would decline to attend the inductions.But Bell, like Baker, stressed Owens\u0027 absence would not affect the ceremony much.\u0027Think of the other members of the class of 2018,\u0027 Bell said. He added: \u0027They deserve their upcoming honor and the celebration. There\u0027s no stain on them because someone doesn\u0027t want to show up.\u0027Think of the players who gave their all to the sport, including many worthy of Hall of Fame consideration, who will never be enshrined. \u0027Think of the family members of former players, coaches and officials – many of whom have passed away – pushing for their loved ones to receive special recognition for career accomplishments.

It\u0027s kind of puzzling. ...

This honor is something that I will cherish forever\u0027.Although he will not be on hand to see his bust unveiled in August, Bell said: \u0027Don\u0027t think of even considering it a sad day for the Hall of Fame.

By comparison, Brando was nearly twice his size, hitting the scales at more than 15 stone (95kg). The archives show a who\u0027s who of acting legends, all white, considered for the role including Alec Guinness, Al Pacino, Albert Finney and Dustin Hoffman.In 1963, Attenborough wrote to Guinness, asking him to play the title role, however, Guinness’s agent replied in the negative, with the actor himself following up with a derisive comment about his portly physique: \u0027I’m too big, grey, fat and blue-eyed and would sound like Peter Sellers.\u0027          Gandhi director Richard Attenborough considered a who\u0027s who of acting legends including Alec Guinness, Al Pacino, Albert Finney and Dustin Hoffman          Richard Attenborough directing Gandhi, 1982Finney (The Bourne Ultimatum and Skyfall) also declined.

Hollywood icon Marlon BrandoThe hunt continued as the director realised the idea of having a white actor play the part of the Father of the Nation would not pan out. So, instead of choosing Brando, the actor famous for such films as A Streetcar Named Desire and The Godfather, Attenborough settled for Ben Kingsley, who he had seen in Bertolt Brecht’s Baal at the Donmar Warehouse.Riverdale producer signs a $400MILLION all-cash deal to stay...Shopfitters discover chest stuffed with £1m worth of...Share this articleSir Ben Kingsley, born Krishna Pandit Bhanji, was part Gujarati by descent.

He was looking for an actor the fit the role would Ben Kingsley be interested?

The drum major is poised to parade in his final Trooping the Colour on a day which will also mark the end of his four-decade career in the British Army (pictured outside the Officers Mess in Munster, 1986)Drum Major Staite also leads one of the massed bands during the parade in slow and quick time - something the father-of-two agreed very few people get to do.\u0027A lot of people tell you it is great to march behind a band, but you can\u0027t beat marching in front of it,\u0027 he said.During his career Drum Major Staite said he has visited 40 of the 50 states in America, and has worked in Kenya, Northern Ireland, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Iraq.It was during a posting to West Berlin on his first deployment that he also patrolled the Berlin Wall and guarded Adolf Hitler\u0027s deputy, Rudolf Hess, when he was held at Spandau prison.Quizzed on what that experience was like, Drum Major Staite who plans on retiring to Middlesbrough with his wife Fee, said: \u0027You just sat in a sanger at Spandau prison.\u0027You weren\u0027t really allowed to look into the yard, it was just a normal prison with one person in it. But driving around the Berlin wall in those days was something very, very different.\u0027Posted to Household Division headquarters in 2000, he was involved in the funeral of the Queen Mother and Lady Margaret Thatcher, the closing ceremony of the 2012 Olympic Games and the royal weddings of Prince Charles and Prince William.June 9 will mark 38 years 355 days in uniform for Drum Major Staite, who described his impending last Trooping the Colour as a \u0027very special moment\u0027.He has also chosen the march the Grenadier Guards will step on to Horse Guards to, which is Wadi Al Batin - a battle honour from the 1991 Gulf War - in which he fought.\u0027Marching on to parade with the band playing Wadi al Batin for me, which is the march I chose, that will be quite emotional,\u0027 he added.Once the parade is finished Drum Major Staite said his state clothing will have to be handed back, something he said he will probably do \u0027with a tear in my eye\u0027.   Turban-wearing Coldstream Guards soldier will make history at Trooping the Colour as the first soldier to parade in Sikh headdress A Coldstream Guards soldier who will wear a turban as he parades during Trooping the Colour has said he hopes it is looked upon as a \u0027new change in history\u0027.More than 1,000 soldiers will take part in the ceremony which marks the Queen\u0027s official birthday on Saturday as the nation honours the monarch.For Guardsman Charanpreet Singh Lall the event is not only his first Trooping the Colour, but also marks the first time a member of the Coldstream Guards has taken part wearing a turban.The 22-year-old from Leicester told the said: \u0027I hope that people watching, that they will just acknowledge it and that they will look at it as a new change in history.\u0027I hope that more people like me, not just Sikhs but from other religions and different backgrounds, that they will be encouraged to join the Army.\u0027A member of the 1st Battalion Coldstream Guards, the turban he will be wearing during Trooping the Colour will be black, featuring the ceremonial cap star to match the bearskin hats.Sikh Coldstream Guard becomes the FIRST soldier to wear a...Prince Harry\u0027s stepbrother and stepsister revealed after...Former head of British forces Field Marshal Guthrie, 79, is...It\u0027s hardly Royal Ascot!

Caroline had helpfully supplied me with a list of jobs, starting with the washing. I know what you’re thinking: the silly muppet put the white stuff in with the coloured stuff and dyed his wife’s underwear blue.But no! I carefully separated the clothes into two batches. I even followed Barty’s advice and put a dry towel in the tumble-dryer to absorb moisture, thereby reducing the drying time. When Caroline returned to the house at lunchtime, I presented her with two baskets full of dry clothes and was expecting massive brownie points.Ripping barns: Homes with a whiff of the farmyard......How to defy the decades like Jen an Courteney: Experts...Put your feet up and sweep away the grind of everyday chores...Share this article‘The job’s not finished,’ she said.‘Eh?’          Toby, pictured, was expecting brownie points from his wife for using the washing machineShe patiently explained that I now had to separate the clothes into six different piles according to which member of the household they belonged to, iron and fold everything, and then place each batch in the right chest of drawers. ‘That doesn’t happen by magic, you know,’ she said – a phrase I would come to hear often in the next few days.Hours spent washing: FourDifficulty level: 710Barty’s tip I shouldn’t have ignored: A cold rinse cycle will prevent creases in non-natural fibres.TUESDAYToday’s task was clearing out the cupboard under the stairs. Yesterday had proved so boring that I downloaded the audiobook of Jordan Peterson’s 12 Rules For Life and listened to it while I got on with the job. Turns out the famous psychologist and Barty have a lot in common. For one thing, Peterson is a big fan of housework. Rule 4 of his book includes the line: ‘Do the damn dishes.’ He also echoes Barty’s advice about not getting demoralised by the sheer scale of the task confronting you.          Toby downloaded an audiobook to listen to while performing the more boring tasks‘Ask yourself: is there one thing that exists in disarray in your life or your situation that you could, and would, set straight?’ he writes. ‘Could you, and would you, fix that one thing that announces itself humbly in need of repair? Could you do it now?’Barty’s version of this is: ‘Don’t be a martyr – take one drawer at a time.’The stair cupboard turned out to be full of the children’s discarded trinkets. Taking all this tat to the Acton Recycling Centre was surprisingly cathartic.Hours spent decluttering: ThreeDifficulty level: 310Barty’s tip I shouldn’t have ignored: Never throw away your children’s toys without asking.WEDNESDAY          Toby discovered that cooking food for his family was more difficult than expected - even though his wife Caroline, left, manages to feed them every day without problemThe cleaner comes today, so I headed outside to clean the wooden garden chairs – a daunting prospect. Rule 1, as far as Barty is concerned, is ‘clean little but often’, thereby not letting anything get too dirty. It’s safe to say I had ignored that when it came to the patio furniture. The chairs were so encrusted with lichen that they were on the point of being reclaimed by nature. I tried Barty’s trick of scrubbing them with a witches’ brew of baking soda, hot water and vinegar, but no dice.I had to bring out the biggest gun in my arsenal: the pressure washer. I had forgotten how much fun it is attacking things with this contraption and ended up cleaning the outside of the conservatory as well. A day well spent, although Caroline did ask why I hadn’t dismantled the bunk beds in my oldest son’s room, changed the light bulbs in the sitting room, or washed out the food recycling bin.Hours spent larking about in the garden: FiveDifficulty level 510Barty’s tip I shouldn’t have ignored: Wear overalls. My Jermyn Street shirt got covered in filthy water.THURSDAYToday was clean-the-kitchen day. To be fair to Caroline, it wasn’t too bad. The tiles above the stove needed a scrub, but the work surfaces were all pretty clean.The only thing that required urgent attention was the oven. Barty’s tip is to fill a third of an oven tray with water and the juice and rinds of two lemons and bake at 250C for half an hour. It worked! I was able to wipe the grease and grime off with kitchen paper after that, although the chips that had turned black and fused with the oven floor proved more resistant. Caroline shrieked when she found me on my knees in front of the oven with a hammer and chisel. ‘I think I better take over,’ she said.Hours spent cleaning: TwoDifficulty level 610Barty’s tip I shouldn’t have ignored: Sprinkle baking soda on a filthy chopping board and wipe with half a lemon.FRIDAY          Toby discovered that using baking soda is an effective method of vacuuming the houseBarty advises using large doormats because they’re a good way of trapping dirt before it gets traipsed into the house. Caroline is way ahead of her here, except that she’s placed a small Ikea rug by the front door instead. To make sure I did it properly, Caroline had borrowed an industrial carpet cleaner from her mother. To complicate things, my mother-in-law had forgotten to include the instructions, so working out how to use it was a bit of an IQ test. Luckily, Caroline was on hand to help.You’re supposed to fill a plastic container that sits inside the vacuum with an expensive cleaning product – manufactured by the same company, natch – but I had some of Barty’s witches’ brew left so I used that.It proved remarkably effective. I can’t say that the rug looked ‘as new’ when I’d finished, but at least you could see the pattern again.Hours spent vacuuming: 1½Difficulty level 810Barty’s tip I shouldn’t have ignored : With stubborn stains, sprinkle bicarbonate of soda on them, leave for 15 minutes, then vacuum.SATURDAY          Toby had to beg his wife Caroline for a day off on the Saturday as a result of the amount of work he had performed during the weekIt was the weekend so I thought I’d follow Barty’s advice and rope in the kids. Their view is that mum does most of the work around the house while dad sits in his garden office drinking tea and playing on his computer (not a million miles from the truth), so they were big supporters of this ‘experiment’.Caroline asked me to make fish pie for lunch, so I press-ganged Charlie, nine, into peeling the potatoes.Schoolboy error. By the time he had finished, they were the size of beans.Cooking in our household is fiendishly difficult because Caroline and Sasha, my 14-year-old daughter, are both vegetarians. That means preparing at least two separate meals – although Ludo, 13, doesn’t like fish, so if that’s the main course, you have to do something different for him, too.Synchronising the cooking times of the different components in one meal is hard enough, but with three it begins to resemble advanced calculus.Needless to say, I did not pull it off. I even managed to burn the four-cheese ravioli, which was a ready meal. ‘Shall we order pizza?’ asked Caroline.Hours spent cooking: ThreeDifficulty level 910Barty’s tip I shouldn’t have ignored: Act fast when it comes to pests or they will multiply. We have an ant infestation in our kitchen because I ignored the early warning signs.          Toby said his week of going housework has made him more reluctant to help out with the domestic chores in future, although he does appreciate his wife, Caroline, more SUNDAYI begged Caroline to let me have a day of rest and she relented. I’d assumed housework would just be drudgery, but some of the tasks required a level of skill completely beyond me.True, I did get a sense of satisfaction from seeing the effects of my cleaning. For a moment or two, the rug looked fantastic. But then the kids came back from school and ruined all my good work. And that’s the trouble with housework: as soon as you think you’ve done it, you have to start over again.Not surprisingly, my week of being a househusband has not left me with a desire to do more domestic chores. Quite the contrary.But it has left me feeling more gratitude towards Caroline. The best thing about the week was giving her some time off, which she thoroughly deserves. The worst thing was the kids falling about with laughter every time they found the wrong item of clothing in their chest of drawers.Without Barty I would have been completely at sea.Next time I’m going to follow all of her tips to the letter. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/20/15/4C77336800000578-0-image-a-22_1526826679557.jpg","title":"Nicola Sturgeon hints NOT call second independence vote autumn","story":"    First Minister Nicola Sturgeon addresses the Scottish National Party conference in AberdeenShe went on to tell the SNP conference in Aberdeen that persuading more Scots of the case for independence was still more important than the timing of a second ballot.Ms Sturgeon said: \u0027As we wait for the fog of Brexit to clear, our opportunity - indeed, our responsibility - is this.\u0027Not just to focus on the when of independence.

The First Minister also announced pay increases for NHS staff as well as increased support for students From July, all staff working under the NHS Agenda for Change who earn up to £80,000 will receive the wage increase.The rise was announced while a three-year pay deal for health staff is still being negotiated, but Ms Sturgeon said she did not want to wait till those talks were done to act.As a result she said a nurse with five years\u0027 experience in Band 5 would be £430 better off, a healthcare assistance at the top of Band 3 would receive £630 more than someone of the same level in England, and an auxiliary nurse with just one year\u0027s experience could earn more than £830 more by working in NHS Scotland.\u0027This is a £160 million investment in those who care for us,\u0027 Ms Sturgeon said.\u0027And as our precious NHS reaches its 70th birthday it comes with our grateful thanks for all that they do.\u0027To help students, she pledged £16 million will be invested next year in increasing college bursaries and university grants for those from poorer families.In addition, the Scottish Government is to raise the threshold at which graduates start repaying student loans, from the current rate of just over £18,000 to £25,000 by April 2021.          Despite the extra cash she announced, the First Minister said Westminster was \u0027dragging Scotland back\u0027 Grants to young people who have been in care who go on to college or university are also being upped, with Ms Sturgeon saying an investment of more than £5 million this year would see these students receive £8,100.While she said Westminster was \u0027dragging Scotland back\u0027, she hailed these changes as \u0027creating a fairer nation\u0027.With the Scottish Government having already pledged to almost double free early years education to 1,140 hours by the end of this Parliament, she spoke out about how this policy would not only help families but give the country an \u0027economic boost\u0027 too.Around 750 nurseries in Scotland will be either built, expanded or refurbished by the end of the Parliament, Ms Sturgeon announced - describing this as a \u0027huge national construction programme to give our children the very best start in life\u0027.She hit out at the UK Government, blasting its \u0027anti-migrant obsession\u0027 and also attacking \u0027Westminister austerity\u0027.With the EU Withdrawal Bill heading back to the House of Commons on Tuesday, she also said it was \u0027decision time for the Tories\u0027 in the row over devolved powers.Ms Sturgeon argued that the Bill as its stands is \u0027completely unacceptable\u0027 as it allows \u0027UK ministers to remove Scotland\u0027s powers for up to seven years\u0027.The First Minister stated: \u0027Next week the prevaricating comes to an end.

He’s got the well-manicured hair and tattoos to match. The 31-year-old Chelsea striker is also the face of a Hugo Boss fragrance and has his own calendar. So perhaps it’s rather predictable that he was also voted the hottest footballer in Britain in 2015. Va-va-voom, indeed!  Cristiano Ronaldo          Portuguese superstar Cristiano Ronaldo isn’t just a goal machine but he is a money-making one tooImpossibly bronzed and waxed, Ronaldo is most definitely his own number one fan. The Portuguese superstar, 33, isn’t just a goal machine but he is a money-making one too. Recently he launched his own CR7 brand which flogs everything from boxer shorts – skimpy and tight with ‘Cristiano’ emblazoned on the waistband – to hotel rooms (footballing hunks not included). And, in case he ever gets fed up of admiring himself, he has a mini-me: his son, immodestly also called Cristiano Ronaldo.            Russian President Vladimir Putin has spent billions on the World Cup because he knows the world’s biggest sporting tournament will make the world come to himTHE BIG GAME\u0027S IN THE KREMLINRussia has become an international pariah following its meddling in Western elections, its backing for Syrian tyrant Bashar Assad, its invasion of Ukraine and the nerve agent attack on Sergei and Yulia Skripal in Salisbury. But Russian President Vladimir Putin has spent billions on the World Cup because he knows the world’s biggest sporting tournament will make the world come to him. Expect Russia’s longest-serving leader since Stalin to bask in the attention he craves. And to use the expensive spectacle to increase his standing among his own people.   ULTRA-TERRIFYINGRussia\u0027s fearsome Ultras have elevated off-field violence to a terrifying new level. While England’s thugs are typically tattooed, overweight, beery louts, the ultra-tattooed, ultra-gym-honed Ultras release YouTube videos of their fighting camps in the Russian forests and have threatened to unleash mayhem at the World Cup – with English fans their prime target.           Russia\u0027s fearsome Ultras have elevated off-field violence to a terrifying new levelThey have been linked to white supremacists, and in Kiev last year some of the thugs sported Vladimir Putin masks marked with swastikas. They are a good deal more fearsome than the ageing Russian players they ‘support’. Perhaps its a good job that Prince William and other notable dignitaries have shown this year’s World Cup the red card.  CHEER UP, COMRADE Russians who work on the railways and the Moscow Metro have been given lessons in how to smile as they prepare to welcome international football fans. Their teacher Elnara Mustafina said: ‘Russian people don’t usually smile. That’s why, when other people come to Russia, they think Russians are not friendly.’ But not everything warrants a smile: 6,000 volunteers have been given an English-Russian phrasebook with entries including, ‘He got in a fight and now he’s unconscious’ and, ‘We need to stop the bleeding.’   HAVE WE GOT A HOPE?As the Three Lions anthem goes, ‘30 years of hurt, never stopped me dreaming’. It’s 52 years now and England still dreams. But there is hope in the form of Harry Kane, one of the squad’s youngest ever captains.           As the Three Lions anthem goes, ‘30 years of hurt, never stopped me dreaming’. It’s 52 years now and England still dreamsThe Spurs striker, 24, will lead one England’s most youthful ever World Cup squads, which includes Marcus Rashford, 20, and Trent Alexander-Arnold, 19. However, expectations – perhaps wisely – are muted for coach Gareth Southgate’s team. William Hill give them odds of 16-1 to win.  LEARN THE LINGOHere are some Russian phrases England fans might need in the coming weeks. ‘I bolen, kak popugai’ is ‘sick as a parrot’. ‘Nu kto tak igraet…!’ means ‘Who the hell plays this badly?’ ‘Get some glasses, ref’ is ‘Vozmi ochki, sudya’ while the locals like to shout: ‘Sudyu na mylo’.... which apparently means they want to make soap out of the ref. If Harry Kane misses a sitter, it’s a simple ‘Mazila’ and if there’s a bad pass, it’s ‘Kozel, ty kuda podaesh?’ ‘It’s a game of two halves’ is ‘podozhdem do kontsa igry’, literally ‘wait till the end of the game’. And ‘Naves’ means ‘on me ’ead, son.’   WE GET GARY, THEY GET HER!The BBC’s Match Of The Day coverage will be led, as always, by jug-eared crisp salesman Gary Lineker. But Russians get former beauty queen Victoria Lopyreva, the official ambassador of the tournament.   The BBC’s Match Of The Day coverage will be led by Gary Lineker - but Russians get former beauty queen Victoria LopyrevaShe will be presenting the coverage for leading broadcaster Channel One as well as interviewing the players, who will doubtless be queuing up to share their views. Victoria, 34, is a model, actress and reality TV star who was named Miss Russia in 2003, and is now one of the country’s best-known TV hosts.   PARTY LIKE A RUSSIAN  When in Russia, drink lots of vodka. For nibbles, why not indulge in traditional blinis and caviarWhen in Russia (or watching from home) why not do what the Russians do? Drink lots of vodka. While the oligarchs will be sipping Billionaire Vodka, which costs £2.8 million per six-litre diamond-studded bottle, Chase vodkas offer an English alternative, made in Herefordshire and costing a more modest £40 a time. It’s available in flavours including marmalade and elderflower.

Since leaving the Army in 2015, the Prince has focused his work on the creation of the Invictus Games and Heads Together, a campaign which seeks to challenge the stigma of mental health problems.A Kensington Palace source said: ‘Harry follows these issues closely and is always keen to get information from a variety of sources.’Welcoming the Prince’s intervention, CSgt Coult, a father of one from Suffolk, promised to launch a fact-finding mission on his behalf.‘I’m delighted that Prince Harry has shown an interest at such a critical time,’ he said. ‘The number of deaths among Iraq and Afghanistan veterans this year is utterly shocking and an indictment of the failure of the Government and military charities to meet their needs.          Died at the age of 35: Christopher Butcher, with wife Laura, was diagnosed with PTSD and died last yearThe MoD doesn’t want to know how many Iraq and Afghanistan veterans are killing themselves, that’s why it doesn’t collate the information itself.’The spate of suspected suicides began with Warrant Officer Nathan Hunt, 39, of the Royal Engineers, who was found hanged on January 2. His death inspired our campaign which led to the MoD setting up the Helpline For Heroes in February.It has since received hundreds of calls from troops suffering from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and other mental health issues. Before our campaign, officials argued such a helpline would attract 50 calls a year at most.Welcoming Harry’s involvement, Nathan’s father Derek Hunt said: ‘He knows what it is like emotionally to serve on the front line. He cares. It is a shocking reflection of the Government that there have been so many suicides among young veterans this year.’Harry served with WO Hunt in Afghanistan in early 2008 as part of a desert reconnaissance unit. Following his death, the Prince expressed his heartfelt condolences to his family. The son of former England football captain Terry Butcher, Army captain Christopher Butcher, served in Iraq and Afghanistan. He was found dead aged 35 at his parents’ home last October following a battle with PTSD.          TRAGEDY OF IRAQ VET: Ex-Royal Marine Dave Evans, who served in Iraq, is suspected to have committed suicide this yearThe suspected suicides of frontline veterans this year also include an elite Special Boat Service (SBS) trooper found hanged in his room at the unit’s base in Poole, Dorset, last month, and Dave Evans, a former Marine who served in Iraq.British military operations in Iraq began in March 2003 and concluded in May 2011. During those 2,974 days, 138 soldiers were killed in hostile action. Following the 911 attacks in 2001, UK operations in Afghanistan started in October 2001. British troops marked the end of operations by handing over Camp Bastion on October 27, 2014. By then, there had been 405 deaths in hostile action over 4,775 days.The MoD said: ‘Any suicide is a tragedy. Help is available for serving personnel and veterans through the 24-hour mental health helplines and we are spending more than £20 million a year on mental health services.’  We must ALL do more to help themComment by Lord Dannatt I am not surprised Prince Harry has expressed concern about this very serious issue. Anyone who has taken part in frontline operations, as the Prince has done, would feel the same way about an increase in suicides in the veteran community.I would also commend Colour Sergeant Trevor Coult, a soldier decorated for his gallantry in Iraq, for bringing this matter to the Prince’s attention.As with the death of Warrant Officer Nathan Hunt earlier this year, any suicide, particularly that of a relatively young veteran, is one too many.There are helplines for veterans and serving personnel now, the latter following a successful campaign by The Mail on Sunday.I would appeal to the families and friends of veterans who are struggling to encourage them to seek help or to inform service charities or their GPs themselves.Don’t leave it until it is too late. Everyone close to someone in danger has a role to play.Everyone realises there is a problem but nobody is complacent. The ongoing challenge is to ensure that those who need help actually get it.We must all do more – the Government, the NHS and the military charities."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/10/08/4D19C0D400000578-5825717-image-a-24_1528615019459.jpg","title":"David Walliams puts 5 35M north London home market 2M paid it","story":"David Walliams has placed his north London house on the market for £2million more than her paid for it 13 years ago          The master bedroom has integrated wardrobes as well as am open-plan en-suite with a freestanding bath and plenty of open spaceThe real Lost Voice Guy: How son of a cancer nurse Lee...Share this articleThe expansive pad was where he lived with ex-wife and model Lara Stone and before that it was owned by Oasis superstar Noel Gallagher.It was dubbed Supernova heights in the nineties because of the extravagant parties its former owner threw.The house boasts a stylish living area, an extensive garden, a roof terrace and private parking.

I even followed Barty’s advice and put a dry towel in the tumble-dryer to absorb moisture, thereby reducing the drying time.

Yesterday had proved so boring that I downloaded the audiobook of Jordan Peterson’s 12 Rules For Life and listened to it while I got on with the job. Turns out the famous psychologist and Barty have a lot in common. For one thing, Peterson is a big fan of housework. Rule 4 of his book includes the line: ‘Do the damn dishes.’ He also echoes Barty’s advice about not getting demoralised by the sheer scale of the task confronting you.          Toby downloaded an audiobook to listen to while performing the more boring tasks‘Ask yourself: is there one thing that exists in disarray in your life or your situation that you could, and would, set straight?’ he writes. ‘Could you, and would you, fix that one thing that announces itself humbly in need of repair? Could you do it now?’Barty’s version of this is: ‘Don’t be a martyr – take one drawer at a time.’The stair cupboard turned out to be full of the children’s discarded trinkets.

Rule 1, as far as Barty is concerned, is ‘clean little but often’, thereby not letting anything get too dirty. It’s safe to say I had ignored that when it came to the patio furniture. The chairs were so encrusted with lichen that they were on the point of being reclaimed by nature. I tried Barty’s trick of scrubbing them with a witches’ brew of baking soda, hot water and vinegar, but no dice.I had to bring out the biggest gun in my arsenal: the pressure washer. I had forgotten how much fun it is attacking things with this contraption and ended up cleaning the outside of the conservatory as well. A day well spent, although Caroline did ask why I hadn’t dismantled the bunk beds in my oldest son’s room, changed the light bulbs in the sitting room, or washed out the food recycling bin.Hours spent larking about in the garden: FiveDifficulty level 510Barty’s tip I shouldn’t have ignored: Wear overalls. My Jermyn Street shirt got covered in filthy water.THURSDAYToday was clean-the-kitchen day. To be fair to Caroline, it wasn’t too bad. The tiles above the stove needed a scrub, but the work surfaces were all pretty clean.The only thing that required urgent attention was the oven. Barty’s tip is to fill a third of an oven tray with water and the juice and rinds of two lemons and bake at 250C for half an hour. It worked! I was able to wipe the grease and grime off with kitchen paper after that, although the chips that had turned black and fused with the oven floor proved more resistant. Caroline shrieked when she found me on my knees in front of the oven with a hammer and chisel. ‘I think I better take over,’ she said.Hours spent cleaning: TwoDifficulty level 610Barty’s tip I shouldn’t have ignored: Sprinkle baking soda on a filthy chopping board and wipe with half a lemon.FRIDAY          Toby discovered that using baking soda is an effective method of vacuuming the houseBarty advises using large doormats because they’re a good way of trapping dirt before it gets traipsed into the house. Caroline is way ahead of her here, except that she’s placed a small Ikea rug by the front door instead. To make sure I did it properly, Caroline had borrowed an industrial carpet cleaner from her mother. To complicate things, my mother-in-law had forgotten to include the instructions, so working out how to use it was a bit of an IQ test. Luckily, Caroline was on hand to help.You’re supposed to fill a plastic container that sits inside the vacuum with an expensive cleaning product – manufactured by the same company, natch – but I had some of Barty’s witches’ brew left so I used that.It proved remarkably effective. I can’t say that the rug looked ‘as new’ when I’d finished, but at least you could see the pattern again.Hours spent vacuuming: 1½Difficulty level 810Barty’s tip I shouldn’t have ignored : With stubborn stains, sprinkle bicarbonate of soda on them, leave for 15 minutes, then vacuum.SATURDAY          Toby had to beg his wife Caroline for a day off on the Saturday as a result of the amount of work he had performed during the weekIt was the weekend so I thought I’d follow Barty’s advice and rope in the kids. Their view is that mum does most of the work around the house while dad sits in his garden office drinking tea and playing on his computer (not a million miles from the truth), so they were big supporters of this ‘experiment’.Caroline asked me to make fish pie for lunch, so I press-ganged Charlie, nine, into peeling the potatoes.Schoolboy error. By the time he had finished, they were the size of beans.Cooking in our household is fiendishly difficult because Caroline and Sasha, my 14-year-old daughter, are both vegetarians. That means preparing at least two separate meals – although Ludo, 13, doesn’t like fish, so if that’s the main course, you have to do something different for him, too.Synchronising the cooking times of the different components in one meal is hard enough, but with three it begins to resemble advanced calculus.Needless to say, I did not pull it off. I even managed to burn the four-cheese ravioli, which was a ready meal. ‘Shall we order pizza?’ asked Caroline.Hours spent cooking: ThreeDifficulty level 910Barty’s tip I shouldn’t have ignored: Act fast when it comes to pests or they will multiply. We have an ant infestation in our kitchen because I ignored the early warning signs.          Toby said his week of going housework has made him more reluctant to help out with the domestic chores in future, although he does appreciate his wife, Caroline, more SUNDAYI begged Caroline to let me have a day of rest and she relented. I’d assumed housework would just be drudgery, but some of the tasks required a level of skill completely beyond me.True, I did get a sense of satisfaction from seeing the effects of my cleaning. For a moment or two, the rug looked fantastic. But then the kids came back from school and ruined all my good work. And that’s the trouble with housework: as soon as you think you’ve done it, you have to start over again.Not surprisingly, my week of being a househusband has not left me with a desire to do more domestic chores. Quite the contrary.But it has left me feeling more gratitude towards Caroline. The best thing about the week was giving her some time off, which she thoroughly deserves. The worst thing was the kids falling about with laughter every time they found the wrong item of clothing in their chest of drawers.Without Barty I would have been completely at sea.Next time I’m going to follow all of her tips to the letter. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/09/22/4D18182100000578-5825269-image-a-31_1528579463733.jpg","title":"World Cup WAGs players set pulses racing","story":"    Bruna Marquezine, 22, is the girlfriend of Brazilian superstar NeymarBruna MarquezineBrazilian superstar Neymar and his actress girlfriend Bruna, 22, have endured a turbulent relationship since meeting six years at the Rio Carnival, but they rekindled their romance at the end of last year. They’re Brazil’s answer to Posh and Becks – but with added samba. Neymar currently earns £1.1 million a month, while Bruna, who has 28 million followers on Instagram, has been a soap star since she was a child.

But hands off, girls, the hausfrau’s favourite is married... to a woman who was named the country’s top WAG. Hummels, 32 – who has also been named one of football’s best-dressed players off the field – married Cathy Fischer in 2015 in a relatively modest ceremony in Munich, where he plays in defence for Bayern Munich. The couple had their first child in January and Cathy now has her own successful ‘mummy blog’ where she shares her tips for happiness.

Monsieur Giroud cites David Beckham as his style icon. He’s got the well-manicured hair and tattoos to match. The 31-year-old Chelsea striker is also the face of a Hugo Boss fragrance and has his own calendar. So perhaps it’s rather predictable that he was also voted the hottest footballer in Britain in 2015. Va-va-voom, indeed!  Cristiano Ronaldo          Portuguese superstar Cristiano Ronaldo isn’t just a goal machine but he is a money-making one tooImpossibly bronzed and waxed, Ronaldo is most definitely his own number one fan. The Portuguese superstar, 33, isn’t just a goal machine but he is a money-making one too. Recently he launched his own CR7 brand which flogs everything from boxer shorts – skimpy and tight with ‘Cristiano’ emblazoned on the waistband – to hotel rooms (footballing hunks not included). And, in case he ever gets fed up of admiring himself, he has a mini-me: his son, immodestly also called Cristiano Ronaldo.            Russian President Vladimir Putin has spent billions on the World Cup because he knows the world’s biggest sporting tournament will make the world come to himTHE BIG GAME\u0027S IN THE KREMLINRussia has become an international pariah following its meddling in Western elections, its backing for Syrian tyrant Bashar Assad, its invasion of Ukraine and the nerve agent attack on Sergei and Yulia Skripal in Salisbury. But Russian President Vladimir Putin has spent billions on the World Cup because he knows the world’s biggest sporting tournament will make the world come to him. Expect Russia’s longest-serving leader since Stalin to bask in the attention he craves. And to use the expensive spectacle to increase his standing among his own people.   ULTRA-TERRIFYINGRussia\u0027s fearsome Ultras have elevated off-field violence to a terrifying new level. While England’s thugs are typically tattooed, overweight, beery louts, the ultra-tattooed, ultra-gym-honed Ultras release YouTube videos of their fighting camps in the Russian forests and have threatened to unleash mayhem at the World Cup – with English fans their prime target.           Russia\u0027s fearsome Ultras have elevated off-field violence to a terrifying new levelThey have been linked to white supremacists, and in Kiev last year some of the thugs sported Vladimir Putin masks marked with swastikas. They are a good deal more fearsome than the ageing Russian players they ‘support’. Perhaps its a good job that Prince William and other notable dignitaries have shown this year’s World Cup the red card.  CHEER UP, COMRADE Russians who work on the railways and the Moscow Metro have been given lessons in how to smile as they prepare to welcome international football fans. Their teacher Elnara Mustafina said: ‘Russian people don’t usually smile. That’s why, when other people come to Russia, they think Russians are not friendly.’ But not everything warrants a smile: 6,000 volunteers have been given an English-Russian phrasebook with entries including, ‘He got in a fight and now he’s unconscious’ and, ‘We need to stop the bleeding.’   HAVE WE GOT A HOPE?As the Three Lions anthem goes, ‘30 years of hurt, never stopped me dreaming’. It’s 52 years now and England still dreams. But there is hope in the form of Harry Kane, one of the squad’s youngest ever captains.           As the Three Lions anthem goes, ‘30 years of hurt, never stopped me dreaming’. It’s 52 years now and England still dreamsThe Spurs striker, 24, will lead one England’s most youthful ever World Cup squads, which includes Marcus Rashford, 20, and Trent Alexander-Arnold, 19. However, expectations – perhaps wisely – are muted for coach Gareth Southgate’s team. William Hill give them odds of 16-1 to win.  LEARN THE LINGOHere are some Russian phrases England fans might need in the coming weeks. ‘I bolen, kak popugai’ is ‘sick as a parrot’. ‘Nu kto tak igraet…!’ means ‘Who the hell plays this badly?’ ‘Get some glasses, ref’ is ‘Vozmi ochki, sudya’ while the locals like to shout: ‘Sudyu na mylo’.... which apparently means they want to make soap out of the ref. If Harry Kane misses a sitter, it’s a simple ‘Mazila’ and if there’s a bad pass, it’s ‘Kozel, ty kuda podaesh?’ ‘It’s a game of two halves’ is ‘podozhdem do kontsa igry’, literally ‘wait till the end of the game’. And ‘Naves’ means ‘on me ’ead, son.’   WE GET GARY, THEY GET HER!The BBC’s Match Of The Day coverage will be led, as always, by jug-eared crisp salesman Gary Lineker. But Russians get former beauty queen Victoria Lopyreva, the official ambassador of the tournament.   The BBC’s Match Of The Day coverage will be led by Gary Lineker - but Russians get former beauty queen Victoria LopyrevaShe will be presenting the coverage for leading broadcaster Channel One as well as interviewing the players, who will doubtless be queuing up to share their views. Victoria, 34, is a model, actress and reality TV star who was named Miss Russia in 2003, and is now one of the country’s best-known TV hosts.   PARTY LIKE A RUSSIAN  When in Russia, drink lots of vodka. For nibbles, why not indulge in traditional blinis and caviarWhen in Russia (or watching from home) why not do what the Russians do? Drink lots of vodka. While the oligarchs will be sipping Billionaire Vodka, which costs £2.8 million per six-litre diamond-studded bottle, Chase vodkas offer an English alternative, made in Herefordshire and costing a more modest £40 a time. It’s available in flavours including marmalade and elderflower.

Since leaving the Army in 2015, the Prince has focused his work on the creation of the Invictus Games and Heads Together, a campaign which seeks to challenge the stigma of mental health problems.A Kensington Palace source said: ‘Harry follows these issues closely and is always keen to get information from a variety of sources.’Welcoming the Prince’s intervention, CSgt Coult, a father of one from Suffolk, promised to launch a fact-finding mission on his behalf.‘I’m delighted that Prince Harry has shown an interest at such a critical time,’ he said. ‘The number of deaths among Iraq and Afghanistan veterans this year is utterly shocking and an indictment of the failure of the Government and military charities to meet their needs.          Died at the age of 35: Christopher Butcher, with wife Laura, was diagnosed with PTSD and died last yearThe MoD doesn’t want to know how many Iraq and Afghanistan veterans are killing themselves, that’s why it doesn’t collate the information itself.’The spate of suspected suicides began with Warrant Officer Nathan Hunt, 39, of the Royal Engineers, who was found hanged on January 2. His death inspired our campaign which led to the MoD setting up the Helpline For Heroes in February.It has since received hundreds of calls from troops suffering from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and other mental health issues. Before our campaign, officials argued such a helpline would attract 50 calls a year at most.Welcoming Harry’s involvement, Nathan’s father Derek Hunt said: ‘He knows what it is like emotionally to serve on the front line. He cares. It is a shocking reflection of the Government that there have been so many suicides among young veterans this year.’Harry served with WO Hunt in Afghanistan in early 2008 as part of a desert reconnaissance unit. Following his death, the Prince expressed his heartfelt condolences to his family. The son of former England football captain Terry Butcher, Army captain Christopher Butcher, served in Iraq and Afghanistan. He was found dead aged 35 at his parents’ home last October following a battle with PTSD.          TRAGEDY OF IRAQ VET: Ex-Royal Marine Dave Evans, who served in Iraq, is suspected to have committed suicide this yearThe suspected suicides of frontline veterans this year also include an elite Special Boat Service (SBS) trooper found hanged in his room at the unit’s base in Poole, Dorset, last month, and Dave Evans, a former Marine who served in Iraq.British military operations in Iraq began in March 2003 and concluded in May 2011. During those 2,974 days, 138 soldiers were killed in hostile action. Following the 911 attacks in 2001, UK operations in Afghanistan started in October 2001. British troops marked the end of operations by handing over Camp Bastion on October 27, 2014. By then, there had been 405 deaths in hostile action over 4,775 days.The MoD said: ‘Any suicide is a tragedy. Help is available for serving personnel and veterans through the 24-hour mental health helplines and we are spending more than £20 million a year on mental health services.’  We must ALL do more to help themComment by Lord Dannatt I am not surprised Prince Harry has expressed concern about this very serious issue. Anyone who has taken part in frontline operations, as the Prince has done, would feel the same way about an increase in suicides in the veteran community.I would also commend Colour Sergeant Trevor Coult, a soldier decorated for his gallantry in Iraq, for bringing this matter to the Prince’s attention.As with the death of Warrant Officer Nathan Hunt earlier this year, any suicide, particularly that of a relatively young veteran, is one too many.There are helplines for veterans and serving personnel now, the latter following a successful campaign by The Mail on Sunday.I would appeal to the families and friends of veterans who are struggling to encourage them to seek help or to inform service charities or their GPs themselves.Don’t leave it until it is too late. Everyone close to someone in danger has a role to play.Everyone realises there is a problem but nobody is complacent. The ongoing challenge is to ensure that those who need help actually get it.We must all do more – the Government, the NHS and the military charities."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/09/21/4D17FFA400000578-0-image-m-12_1528577817504.jpg","title":"Did Theresa Mays former aide leak Boris Johnstons  Brexit talks","story":"    Stephen Canning, 25, (pictured far right) is seated four places from Boris Johnson (far left) at the private dinner on Wednesday evening where he is seen holding a mobile phone The Mail on Sunday has obtained a photograph of Mr Canning, 25, seated four places from Mr Johnson at the private dinner on Wednesday evening.Mr Johnson’s allies claim the photograph showing Mr Canning holding a mobile phone, which can be used as a tape recorder, backs up their claim.Organised by the Thatcherite Conservative Way Forward group, the dinner was attended by a handful of MPs and party donors, prompting a furious row over who leaked it to the media.Share this articleMr Canning is no stranger to controversy.           Mr Canning has been accused of leaking Boris Johnson’s comments that Donald Trump would make a better job of Brexit talksHe was suspended as deputy chairman of the party’s youth wing in 2015 in the wake of the so-called ‘Tatler Tory’ scandal following the suicide of bullied young activist Elliott Johnson.He was lined up to lead a new Conservative youth wing earlier this year but was suspended again after an incident at a London nightclub when a Tory MP’s aide was allegedly struck.Mr Canning, who campaigned for Mrs May when she ran for the party leadership in 2016, strongly denied the claim, and said he was defending a female friend from harassment by an ex-boyfriend.Mr Canning became an Essex councillor aged 18, one of the youngest in Britain. His recent suspension forced him to switch from being a Conservative councillor to an independent.He did not respond to requests for a comment."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/03/05/12/49DF4CDA00000578-0-image-a-50_1520251215969.jpg","title":"Victorian PM Benjamin Disraels favourite view England set blighted new homes","story":"    Disraeli monument by Edward Buckton Lamb with Hughenden Manor in the background, High Wycombe, BuckinghamshireThe project is one of dozens planned across the country that could encroach on treasured beauty spots.Lucy Murfett, planning officer for the Chiltern Conservation Board, recognised the ‘huge need for development’ across the UK, but said: ‘The finest and most beautiful parts of the countryside must be protected and kept special.’Protesters say the planned homes will ‘creep up the slopes of the valley’ and blight the magnificent view from Hughenden Manor – a vast mansion built in the Gothic revival style and now owned by the National Trust – to the monument to Disraeli’s father, the author Isaac D’Israeli, that sits in its 680-acre grounds.Theresa May hints empty shops could be turned into homes as...Britain’s housing crisis isn\u0027t a lack of homes... it\u0027s not...Share this articleIn the past five years, rural land a third the size of London has been lost to development, including new homes in or close to such beauty spots as the Kent Downs, the South Downs, the High Weald and the North Wessex Downs.Now the Campaign to Protect Rural England is calling for more housing in cities rather than encroaching on the countryside.Matt Thomson, the body’s head of planning, said: ‘Vast areas of the countryside are under threat.’Campaigners want more homes to be built on previously developed ‘brownfield’ sites rather than on the green belt.Guidelines say councils should refuse planning permission for major development except in exceptional circumstances.

They have had a sense of humour about this because it’s so ridiculous.‘They are stunned that so many people have believed it, and also stunned that it so quickly got around. They spoke about it and laughed a lot. They have absolutely no idea where or how it started.

It does not give prices but the list price of a similar facility in New York is $35,000 a night.But who will pick up the bill for the North Koreans\u0027 stay has been the subject of much speculation.     The plane carrying North Korea\u0027s leader approaches to land at Changi International Airport in Singapore on Sunday          A large limousine with a North Korean flag could be seen surrounded by other black vehicles with tinted windows as it sped through the city\u0027s streets           North Korean security personnel run next to a motorcade carrying North Korea\u0027s leader Kim Jong-un in Singapore on Sunday          The motorcade carrying North Korean leader Kim Jong-un arrives at the St Regis hotel in Singapore, where he is staying          Police vehicles vehicles block an entrance outside the St. Regis Hotel in Singapore on Sunday ahead of the historic summit          Police inspect vehicles at a checkpoint at the back of the St Regis Hotel ahead of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un\u0027s arrival          An armed police officer guards the entrance of the international media centre in Sinagpore on Sunday          A man takes a photo of a police notice outside the St. Regis Hotel in Singapore.

It is linked to the city by a bridge and home to high-end resorts, golf courses and a large amusement park.But the macabre history of the island, which will become the venue of the historic summit on Tuesday, is less known.In the 18th century, when Singapore was a British colony, an unknown epidemic killed off most of its population of 60. Only two households survived.During World War II, the British used artillery forts and a battery on the island to unsuccessfully fend off a Japanese invasion, which transformed it into a prisoner-of-war camp.It\u0027s no wonder the island was known as Pulau Blakang Mati, which roughly translates as \u0027island of death from behind.\u0027In 1970, the island was renamed after a nationwide contest. Sentosa was subsequently developed as a resort and expanded on reclaimed land.          Technicians install a surveillance camera at the entrance of the five-star Capella Hotel on Sentosa island on SaturdayNevertheless, Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore\u0027s prime minister from 1959 to 1990, used the island to hold long-term political prisoners who were often detained without trial. Chia Thye Poh, a former member of parliament, spent 23 years in jail and under loose house arrest there.He worked as a freelance translator for the island\u0027s management, before he was allowed to visit the mainland for a short time every day and set free.But these days, Sentosa is a popular resort island, with numerous beaches, hotels and restaurants, and attracts around 19 million visitors every year.                                                         Journalists and onlookers watch the motorcade carrying North Koran leader Kim Jong Un-un arriving at the St. Regis hotel ahead of the US-North Korea summit          Hundreds of Singaporeans lined the streets to capture images of their own of his black Mercedes Benz stretch limousine with tinted windows - not normally allowed in Singapore, even for the country\u0027s prime minister          Singapore police stand guard outside the St Regis hotel where the North Korean leader will stay with signs informing people that security checks will be taking place          A large limousine with a North Korean flag could then be seen surrounded by other black vehicles with tinted windows as it sped through the city\u0027s streets          Pedestrians walk in front of the luxurious St Regis Hotel in Singapore, where North Korean leader Kim Jong-un is staying          Kim Jong-un impersonator Howard X (right) and Donald Trump impersonator Dennis Alan (left) pose for a photo making a fist bump as they make an appearance at the Bugis Junction shopping mall in Singapore on SaturdayHappiest man in the world: Peter Stringfellow\u0027s last TV interview\u0027Multi-millionaire\u0027 on train calls woman a \u0027black slave\u0027Police in Trealaw after \u0027unexplained\u0027 death of three-year-old girl16-year-old left in critical condition after stabbing in StreathamTrooping the Colour: Queen travels down The Mall in carriageTrooping The Colour: The Queen at 92 watches as guardsmen marchHarry, Meghan and Kate leave Palace for Trooping the ColourTrooping the Colour: Newlyweds Harry and Meghan wow the crowdsTrump calls for Russia to return to international foldFormer head of British forces Marshal Guthrie thrown from horse    Armed police officers patrol outside the Shangri-La hotel where US President Donald Trump will stay ahead of the US-North Korea summit in SingaporeKim is set to meet with Trump on Tuesday in what\u0027s shaping up to be one of the most unusual summits in modern history. Despite the initial high stakes of a meeting meant to rid North Korea of its nuclear weapons, the talks have been portrayed by Trump in recent days more as a get-to-know-each-other meeting.  He has also raised the possibility of further summits and an agreement ending the Korea War by replacing the armistice signed in 1953 with a peace treaty. China and South Korea would have to sign off on any legal treaty.  Trump departed the G7 summit in Charlevoix, Canada, early, telling reporters he was embarking on a \u0027mission of peace.\u0027 He said: \u0027I will be on a mission of peace and will carry in my heart the hearts of millions of people, all over the world. \u0027We really think North Korea will be a tremendous place in a very short period of time and we appreciate everything that\u0027s going on.\u0027           Bystanders take photos of the limousine carrying North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, ahead of the US-North Korea summit          A crowd of spectators gathers outside the Istana Presidential Palace, where North Korean leader Kim Jong-un will arrive          Singapore police officers work to keep a crowd of onlookers behind barriers outside the Istana Presidential Palace on Sunday          A line of police cars arrive at the Istana, the official residence of the prime minister, ahead of a scheduled meeting between the Singaporean prime minister and North Korea\u0027s leader Kim Jong-unHe added to reporters: \u0027It\u0027s unknown territory in the truest sense, but I really feel confident. \u0027I feel that Kim Jong-un wants to do something great for his people and he has that opportunity and he won\u0027t have that opportunity again.\u0027It\u0027s never been done before. And obviously, what has been done before hasn\u0027t worked.\u0027Raising expectations, Trump had also said the outcome of the meeting will rely heavily on his own instincts. The US president, who prides himself on his deal-making prowess, said he will know \u0027within the first minute\u0027 of meeting Kim whether the North Korean leader is serious about the nuclear negotiations. \u0027I think I\u0027ll know pretty quickly whether or not, in my opinion, something positive will happen. And if I think it won\u0027t happen, I\u0027m not going to waste my time. I don\u0027t want to waste his time,\u0027 he said.\u0027This is a leader who really is an unknown personality,\u0027 Trump added of Kim.            Singapore military personnel patrol in front of the gate of the Istana Presidential Palace, where North Korean Leader Kim Jong-un and Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong will meet on Sunday          The North Korean leader is scheduled  with Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong ahead of Tuesday\u0027s historic summit          Security gather outside the gates of the Istana, the official residence of the prime minister, ahead of a scheduled meeting between the Singaporean prime minister and Kim          Singapore police officers gather in front of the gate of the Istana Presidential Palace, where  Kim Jong-un is scheduled to arrive          Protest signs, including one calling for Trump\u0027s impeachment, are laid out for a \u0027Peace Gathering\u0027 at Hong Lim Park in Singapore on Sunday\u0027People don\u0027t know much about him. I think that he\u0027s going to surprise on the upside, very much on the upside.\u0027White House aides described Trump in the days after receiving Kim\u0027s initial invitation as being obsessed by visions of winning the Nobel Peace Prize and using `The Art of the Deal\u0027 to put his mark on the global order. But in recent weeks, Trump\u0027s enthusiasm has been tempered somewhat by the challenge of deal-making with such an unpredictable opponent. And there are worries from the White House to East Asian allies that Trump\u0027s desire for an agreement will lead him to accept any deal - even if it\u0027s a bad one.The Trump-Kim meeting has captured intense global attention after a turn to diplomacy in recent months replaced, for the time being, serious fears of war last year amid North Korean nuclear and missile tests. The North, many experts believe, stands on the brink of being able to target the entire US mainland with its nuclear-armed missiles.          North Korean leader Kim Jong-un is driven in car with flags flying as the motorcade heads out of Singapore\u0027s Changi Airport           The Trump-Kim meeting has captured global attention after a turn to diplomacy  replaced serious fears of war last year          Kim is set to meet with Trump on Tuesday in what\u0027s shaping up to be one of the most unusual summits in modern history           Singapore police on guard outside the St Regis hotel, where North Korean leader Kim Jong-un will stay ahead of the summitWhile there\u0027s deep skepticism that Kim will quickly give up those hard-won nukes, there\u0027s also some hope that diplomacy can replace the animosity between the U.S. and the North.The North Korean autocrat\u0027s every move will be followed by 3,000 journalists up until he shakes hands with Trump. He has only publicly left his country three times since taking power after his despot father\u0027s death in late 2011 - twice traveling to China and once across his shared border with the South to the southern part of the Demilitarized Zone in recent summits with the leaders of China and South Korea respectively.  There\u0027s a flurry of speculation about what results might come from the summit. The initial goal was the \u0027complete denuclearisation\u0027 of the North. Pyongyang has said it\u0027s willing to deal away its entire nuclear arsenal if the United States provides it with a reliable security assurance and other benefits. But many, if not all analysts, say that this is highly unlikely, given how hard it has been for Kim to build his program and that the weapons are seen as the major guarantee to his unchecked power.            North Korean security personnel arrive at the St Regis hotel ahead of his expected arrival of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un          Members of the North Korean delegation are seen in Singapore on Sunday ahead of the summit between Trump and Kim           The North Korean autocrat\u0027s every move will be followed by 3,000 journalists up until he shakes hands with Trump. Pictured, members of the North Korean delegation          Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un are scheduled to meet at the Capella Hotel in Sentosa for a historic summit. Pictured, Singapore policeAny nuclear deal will hinge on North Korea\u0027s willingness to allow unfettered outside inspections of the country\u0027s warheads and radioactive materials, much of which is likely kept in a vast complex of underground facilities. Past nuclear deals have crumbled over North Korea\u0027s reluctance to open its doors to outsiders.But one result of the summit could be the opening of a McDonald\u0027s in North Korea as a reward and security guarantee for cutting back its nuclear ambitions. Chung-in Moon, a special adviser to South Korean president Moon Jae-in, recently revealed that North Korea wants American investments to deliver a boost to the nation\u0027s economy. Officials from Kim\u0027s regime said they would view American investments as a vital guarantee to their country\u0027s security at a dinner that followed the recent historic summit between Kim and Moon.Chung-in suggested the fast food chain - a symbol of American culture and power - and a Trump hotel could be businesses that open in Pyongchang.Another possibility from the summit is a deal to end the Korean War, which North Korea has long demanded, presumably, in part, to get US troops off the Korean Peninsula and, eventually, pave the way for a North Korean-led unified Korea.

Her body is held together by straps. Tears stream down her cheeks and her poor flesh is everywhere pierced with sharp little nails. It is one of Kahlo’s most famous martyrdoms.The painting is called The Broken Column, which throws the focus so completely on the spine – depicted as a ruined Ionic column – as to make the straps seem incidental, or perhaps as metaphorical as the architecture. But Kahlo (1907-54) really did live inside such a harness. The object appears in a show of her possessions opening at the Victoria and Albert Museum this week, and it is a horrific contraption of metal spars, cloth restraints and nail-like buckles. Its representation turns out to be the documentary truth.The photographs are extraordinary testimony in themselves. You see Kahlo working with her legs in callipers, confined to a wheelchair or even in bed. In one picture, immobilised by yet another botched operation on the spine, she lies horizontal beneath a suspended canvas, somehow continuing to paint.Kahlo’s father was a German photographer, also brilliantly inventive. He made many self-portraits – caustic, comic, melancholy, nude – so that the idea of picturing one’s autobiography was already second nature to the young Frida. She helped him to pose, develop and retouch his photographs, and they were further united by illness: his epilepsy, her childhood polio.Their bond is implicit in a terrific family photograph of German grandparents, Mexican matriarchs and all of Frida’s sisters, including Cristina, who would one day have an affair with Frida’s husband, Diego Rivera. But where is Kahlo herself? She turns out to be the young man wearing her father’s suit and looking keenly out at him while leaning on the shoulder of a conspicuously affronted relative. It is the spryest of in-jokes.Kahlo’s androgyny – “in general, I have the face of the opposite sex” – coexists with the extreme femininity of her self-portraits. Cult followers will be able to see the actual relics: her favourite Revlon lipstick, the eye pencil she used to emphasise her monobrow, a jade necklace still stained with paint. In New York for medical treatment, she poses nude for a lover, unplaiting her elaborate headdress of hair into dark Rapunzel locks – always alluring, even in anguish.She lived dying, said a friend, and not even the art can convey this to quite the same degree as certain objects at the V\u0026ampA. A pair of black velvet shoes, for instance, tough yet elegant but look twice: one has been tailored so that nothing might press down on her gangrenous toes. Or the red leather boots, wedge-heeled and embroidered with dragons, fit for Vivienne Westwood. One is still laced to Kahlo’s prosthetic leg.More than 20 corsets were made to support her crumbling bones, some of steel, others of leather, including one resembling a heavy saddle. The V\u0026ampA has plaster corsets, cast to her body while Kahlo was suspended upside down, one so tight she had to be rapidly cut free. Others she decorated with Mexican flora, or hammers and sickles.“What do I need feet for if I have wings to fly?” runs the caption beneath a drawing of the amputated foot. Her courage in all this suffering staggers. One spotlit gallery contains 20 model Fridas clad in those long, full-skirted dresses that always seemed to be worn for political reasons – Tehuana national costume – but which now look, too, like magnificent camouflage for battered limbs. A sketch showing the artist vulnerably naked beneath her plumage confirms it.If the language of emotional martyrdom has sometimes seemed hard to take – Kahlo with sword to the heart, or as a running deer stuck with arrows – it now seems as if she made comparatively little of the medical horrors endured from the age of six to her premature death at 47. And more than that, she keeps up appearances – of both sorts – all through her life. A fragment of period film in this show reveals what looks like a dressing table loaded with cosmetics in the Blue House in fact these turn out to be oil paints. But the connection is profound. Kahlo makes herself up – and then makes herself up once again, on the canvas.Meanwhile, the American artist Cindy Sherman comes full circle at London’s Sprüth Magers, with a new series of photographs of ageing Hollywood stars from the 1920s and 30s, 40 years after her celebrated Untitled Film Stills of Hollywood starlets. In both, she plays all the parts. And so authentic is the image, once again, that it seems as if one recognises the actual actress – Marlene Dietrich in powerful red velvet, Bette Davis in a turban, the It girl Clara Bow now grown poignantly old.Of course they are all fictions, and here, more than in any other show, Sherman’s special effects are all laid out in full view. The different shapes painted on her own concealed lips, the eyebrows erased and replaced with seductive crescents or surprised hyphens, the tinted powders and eyeliners that override the fixed colour of her own eyes. It is a masterclass in makeup, quite apart from anything else, so that in the latest shot, from 2018, Sherman appears as four completely different actresses with only a single shared characteristic – namely their ineradicable age.One sees this in the thickening of the hands, neck and arteries, in the strength of the wrists and the force of the fingers – everything that cannot quite be concealed, either by these imaginary performers or the woman who portrays them. Some play with scarves to hide their wrinkles, others rely on a brave, haughty or mysterious expression. All could quite clearly carry off once more whatever roles they played on the silver screen until age edged them out of the system. But in each case there are a hundred more nuances, of doubt, pride, suffering, foolishness, survival, courage, learned from the life and irrepressible even in these supposed publicity shots for films that will never be made. The hands and eyes that cannot be masked, of course, quite conspicuously belong to Sherman, now in her mid-60s and with decades of superb work to her name. For the first time, perhaps, she reveals something of herself.Star ratings (out of 5)Frida Kahlo: Making Her Self Up ★★★★★Cindy Sherman ★★★★★• Frida Kahlo: Making Her Self Up is at the Victoria \u0026amp Albert Museum, London, from 16 June until 4 November"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2c91dd18fa5fef1db839619439a5896aa3b8c3cc/96_265_4776_2865/master/4776.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ea99120c37386b1df0611fd81bfbcd72","title":"inside north korea oliver wainwright pastel fairyland built to forget","story":"When Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un finally meet face-to-face at their momentous summit in Singapore on Tuesday, it will be more than a coming together of two powerful men with a penchant for missiles and curious haircuts. Beyond the jocular Twitter exchanges over nuclear war, the president and the supreme leader share a dearly held passion for outre architecture and flamboyant interiors.Kim’s taste is a more closely guarded secret. Even the locations of his many residences are shrouded in mystery. But hints can be gleaned from his ambition to “turn the whole country into a socialist fairyland”, as one of North Korea’s official patriotic slogans declares, and by the wave of startling structures that has been sweeping Pyongyang since he came to power.“Pyonghattan” was the joke nickname given by foreign diplomats to a cluster of shiny cylindrical towers that emerged in the capital in 2012, assuming this was a one-off publicity stunt. But since then, almost every year has seen the grand unveiling of another lavish trophy project, each more futuristic than the last, with parades of jaunty towers dressed in sci-fi costumes and crowned with cosmic symbols, worthy of scenes from The Jetsons.Future Science Street was well under construction when I visited Pyongyang in 2015 on an architectural tour – scenes from which are captured in a new book, out this month, which aims to provide a glimpse behind the closed doors of the famously secretive country. Armies of soldier-builders were racing to finish the new riverside district of 2,500 apartments for “scientists of the future” in time for the 70th anniversary of the foundation of the Workers’ party. One tapering concrete shaft took the form of a steroidal pagoda, while bright orange and green tiles were being hastily applied to other curving towers, designed “in the shape of an intellectual’s calligraphy brush”, according to our guides.Colour is the most surprising thing about visiting North Korea. Where you might expect to find a drab Soviet-style world of crumbling concrete slabs and inflated Stalinist ministry buildings, Pyongyang instead unfolds as a pastel panorama. There are blocks in minty green and terracotta, mustard and ochre, as well as more recent apartment towers that look like sticks of seaside rock, clad with spiralling blue balconies. It is a hipster dream of turquoise and millennial pink.The pastel palette continues inside, where behind closed doors we would find interiors as unreal as stage sets, ordered with the eerie symmetry of a Wes Anderson movie. The Rungrado May Day stadium, built in 1989, had just been refurbished, replete with locker rooms, physio clinic and media centre decked out with synthetic vinyl surfaces in sugary colours, assembled with the crisp perfection of a Thomas Demand paper sculpture.Is was unlike anything I had seen before, but entirely in keeping with Korea’s official Juche ideology, which specifies that all architectural inspiration should come only from within and be uniquely Korean in its essence. “An architect who is convinced that his country and his things are the best will not look upon foreign things or try to copy them,” Kim Jong-il declared in his 1991 160-page treatise, On Architecture. Instead, he must “make tireless efforts to create architecture amenable to his\u0026nbsppeople”.The young Kim seems to have latched on to his father’s amenity principle. In an unlikely bid to boost tourism and cater to North Korea’s growing middle class, he is furnishing the country with a host of leisure facilities, from a new ski resort to plans for an underwater hotel. The capital now boasts a hi-tech shooting range, where visitors can take potshots at pheasants, as well as a new horse-riding centre, where children of the elite can have a taste of rural life for the equivalent of $5 an hour – around the average weekly wage of most North Koreans.When we departed Pyongyang for the border to the south, driven along a deserted pothole-riddled highway, past rusting pylons and ragged children playing on the street, it soon became clear that we had left a limited bubble of prosperity. It was evident that the candy colours and kindergarten kitsch are used as an architectural anaesthetic, the state’s saccharine salve to infantilise its people and numb them to the abject realities of everyday life in the Hermit Kingdom.• Inside North Korea by Oliver Wainwright is published on 22 June (Taschen, £40).

I remember our encounter vividly: the chaos of his office, with its filthy walls and toppling piles of notebooks the unstoppable flow of his conversation the wolfish greed with which he scoffed his eggs at breakfast. Above all, what has stayed with me was his almost total lack of interest in anything other than his reporting (by his own estimation, pretty brilliant) his contacts (so numerous that they rival the crowd at the Super Bowl) his editors (occasionally fantastic, but more often annoying and dumb). If Hersh had a hinterland, he was keeping it well hidden.Thanks to this, I was well prepared for Reporter, a memoir he only embarked upon because the book he was contracted to write for his publishers – a coruscating volume about Dick Cheney and all who sail in him – had hit the buffers. I guessed – correctly, as it turned out – that Reporter would be unrelenting, and focused entirely on his work that it would come with no false modesty (or much modesty at all). All the same, even I was taken aback by the extent of his completism. Did he kidnap the book’s editor, tie him or her up until it was at the printers? It’s right that the big stories he has reported – My Lai, the domestic and foreign policy crimes of the Nixon era, the abuse of Iraqi prisoners by US soldiers at Abu Ghraib – are recounted in chapters that run to many pages. But it seems a bit much when, determined not to leave anything out, he resorts literally to running lists of the other, smaller scandals on which he worked in between. Detail swamps his narrative, like creeper clambering over an ancient Mayan ruin, and for the reader, hacking through it is completely exhausting.It is not, however, dispiriting – or not all the time. Here\u0026nbspis journalistic tenacity of a kind that, social media being what it is, is close to nonexistent today. The story of how Hersh, then a broke freelance, stumbled on the appalling events at My Lai is familiar by now: when a military lawyer told him that a soldier at Fort Benning in Georgia was facing a court martial for killing\u0026nbspat least 109 Vietnamese civilians, Hersh simply rocked up at the base and went door to door until he found 26-year-old Lt William L Calley Jr (he later followed this up with an even more amazing interview, this time with Paul Meadlo, a farm kid from Indiana who had shot many of the civilians before losing a leg himself).\u0026nbspReading\u0026nbspabout it here, though, you’re reminded all over again of just how hard it was to get such a scoop published. The first report was rejected out of hand by many media organisations, among them the New York Times, and carefully rewritten – Hersh sold it through a tiny agency – by others seemingly made nervous and resentful by it.All the Vietnam movies in the world, moreover, cannot lessen the impact of My Lai 50 years on, its horrors will not be varnished. Hersh’s excitement at the trail, and what it might mean both for his career and those of the warmongers, is tempered here by details that stay with you long after you put the book down: the sight of Calley, on the night the two men first met, vomiting blood, the result of a serious ulcer an account, given to Hersh by a GI who’d shot himself in the foot in order to get out of My Lai, of a soldier who used his bayonet to toss a little boy in the air as if he were a “papier-mache piñata”. Hersh might be a monomaniac, but he deserves all the respect in the world for the work he did then. Determination, even obduracy sometimes, directed unyieldingly at politicians and other high-ups, is never not a good thing – something that, as he notes, his more craven colleagues in the US press would do well to remember. Judge a hack by his enemies (Kissinger was one of his), not his friends. Journalists must arm themselves with facts, not settle into tired punditry. “I think, I think…” For Hersh, these are the deadliest words in the language.Hersh’s parents were Jewish immigrants to Chicago, and when his father died in 1954, a month after his son had graduated from high school, it seemed likely that he might spend the rest of his days running the family cleaning business. He was saved by a college teacher and after graduating from university, joined a local news bureau as a copy boy. Apart from a brief period when he worked as press secretary to the Democratic senator Eugene McCarthy – surprise, surprise: they fell out – he has never not been a journalist. After winning his Pulitzer he joined first the New Yorker, then the New York Times he would later return to the former under Tina Brown. Did he make editors like her nervous? Just a little. Brown once told him that the US secretary of state Colin Powell had informed her, over dinner, that Hersh was a liar. He heard the edge in her voice, but reminded her that such a comment was “a badge of honour” for someone who’d never been invited to a White House junket and never wanted to be. (The closeness of editors to politicians, whether of left or right, appals him.)He’s not always sure-footed. In the 90s, when he was working on a book about Kennedy, he was taken in by some documents that purported to show that the president was being blackmailed by Marilyn Monroe the fact that he discovered this in time to remove all mention of them didn’t stop his critics from piling in. But you have to say that his instincts are mostly great. Hersh’s laws of journalism, which will, alas, never be taught on any media studies course, are something to live by. Sometimes, he\u0026nbspwrites, a story just “smells” right: this was certainly his feeling when an Iraqi general first told him that under the US occupation, women prisoners were being assaulted by guards to the point where, regarding\u0026nbspthemselves as dishonoured, they would write to their fathers and beg them to come and kill them. But still, it is important to hold your scepticism, if not your cynicism, close.

While campaigning to be prime minister in 2016, she attacked the levels of corporate pay and said there had to be changes to the way UK companies were run. “If I’m prime minister,” she said, “we’re going to have not just consumers represented on company boards but workers as well.”May was not the first prime minister to think it would be a good idea for workers to have a say in how companies are run. As prime minister in the 1970s, James Callaghan commissioned a report on industrial democracy from the historian Alan Bullock. When the committee finally reported, a majority supported the idea that there should be equal numbers of trade union and shareholder representatives on the boards of private companies employing more than 2,000 people.Callaghan was such a strong supporter of the proposal that he arranged and attended a meeting of the Bullock committee with the then German chancellor, Helmut Schmidt, who was witheringly dismissive of the idea that workers on boards would lead to profits being erted from investment to wages. On the contrary, Schmidt insisted, industrial democracy had been one of the pillars on which Germany’s postwar economic miracle had been built.In the end, the Bullock report was kicked into the long grass. Despite support from Callaghan, the leader of the TUC, Len Murray, and Jack Jones, the head of the Transport and General Workers’ Union and a member of the committee, it was strongly opposed by the CBI and by inidual trade unions from across the political spectrum.The rest, as they say, is history. The failure to press ahead with the Bullock report’s recommendations will – along with the failure to put Britain’s North Sea oil receipts into a sovereign wealth fund – go down as one of the great missed opportunities of the past half-century. Some things have changed since 1977. After the many defeats suffered since Callaghan was followed into Downing Street by Margaret Thatcher, trade unions are all for greater industrial democracy. However, May’s plan produced exactly the same response from employers as Callaghan encountered. Resistance from the CBI has meant May’s proposals have been watered down. Plans for legislation to be presented to parliament on Monday will require companies to publish the ratio of what their chief executive is paid compared wih the average worker and how much executives will benefit if share prices go up but there will be no requirement to put workers on boards.May’s original proposal was hardly revolutionary but the CBI lobbied hard and was able to kill it off with relative ease. Falling trade union membership and tougher laws mean that employers hold the whip hand over their employees. They intend to keep it that way.If UK bosses imagine that having workers on boards will cramp their style, the experience of France suggests they are wrong. Oxfam France has recently published a detailed analysis of the accounts of companies in the CAC 40 – the roll call of the biggest companies listed on the Paris stock exchange, including AXA, Michelin, Peugeot and Total.It found that Anglo-Saxon-style capitalism – fat cat chief executives, a focus on shareholder value, widespread use of tax havens – is alive and well on the other side of the Channel, even though French law insists on employee representation on boards for all large companies.“As a result, the distribution of wealth between the various stakeholders in CAC 40 companies has never been so uneven,” the Oxfam France report says. “While rewards for shareholders and CEOs have rocketed since the financial crisis, workers have seen their pay stagnate investments in the long-term future of the companies have often been cut: and tax revenues which governments need to invest in vital public services have dwindled.”This gets to the heart of the matter. There is nothing intrinsically wrong with executives being well rewarded for running successful businesses. Yet something is going seriously awry when rising executive pay sits alongside flatlining earnings for employees and higher idend payouts come at the expense of investment. At that point, the old justifications – risk-taking has to be remunerated and workers benefit from idends through their pension funds – wear a bit thin. Employers have got everything they wanted: the right to manage, the emasculation of organised labour, much higher salaries and lower personal taxes. In return, they were supposed to bring about stronger growth, higher investment and rising living standards for all. They have not done so, which is why they are currently held in such low esteem.Schmidt was right all those years ago. Workers want to make sure they will have a job five years down the road and can see the point of investing in the companies’ long-term future. Leaving everything in the hands of shareholders has led to short-termism and failure. The problem with May’s proposals was not their radicalism: it was that they did not go far enough."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb5d8844866884ba501848654de177c824a10c75/0_313_4759_2855/master/4759.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ac90d47e09f71397b92ba1bc7a910df0","title":"as their cause crumbles brexiters turn to fantasy and bitter recriminations","story":"While the Tory party is consuming itself in civil war, Labour could take advantage – if only it were able resolve its own internal tensionsIt is when politicians make millenarian claims of permanent irreversibility for any policy that you know they and the accompanying project are in trouble. I remember, from my teenage years, Rhodesia’s then prime minister, Ian Smith, unilaterally declaring independence, proclaiming that the new country would last a thousand years the extravagance of the claim was required because of its very improbability. You knew he was on doomed ground.Similarly, Boris Johnson’s now infamous leaked dinner remarks declaring that he had no doubt that Britain would leave the EU, which would be “irreversible”. It was a sign that the Brexit cause has its back against the wall – constructing an alternative reality based on faith and ideology in the face of real world facts that refuse to accommodate themselves to Brexiter will. This is the first harbinger of political doom: if you can’t think straight, you regress to claims of irreversibility. The policy that follows will prove unworkable.The mathematics don’t add up. In any case, the World Trade Organization, so beloved of Brexiters as their new free trade , is a broken reed. Riven by factions and with no enforcement powers, it is incapable of even adjudicating between the countries waging dangerous trade wars, let alone stopping them. To leave the sanctuary of global EU is to swim with crocodiles.The second reality is that Britain, an extraordinarily open economy for its size, is dependent on the frictionless trade offered by the single market and the customs union to sustain its prosperity. Every attempt at creating the same effect – from “max fac”, to the tortured compromises on the Irish border, to the Labour party’s no less unworkable proposition of a “shared single market” – necessarily falls short.Frictionless trade means accepting EU practices, regulations and standards – ie surrendering control, the Brexit red line. Inside the EU, Britain ensured that all but a fraction of the regulations and standards suited it, a wonderful position of having your cake and eating it. Outside, it faces huge expense, loss of control and reduced access to its closest markets. Inward investment has plummeted: car industry investment has halved as companies take stock of the receding market possibilities. Again, madness. Outside the EU, Brexit Britain is going to have to accept EU regulations that are emerging as the global standard – the “Brussels effect”. Only the US and China, with their vast markets, have a chance of challenging these, but US companies in particular know that if they conform to the EU’s gold standard they will conform to lower US ones, so it’s easier to do just that. So will British companies, orbiting around the EU as Johnson fears, but with no voice in determining the standards they follow. It may be stupid and self-defeating, but so is the whole Brexit case.Third, and as telling, what fired Brexiters was the chance, outside the EU, of completing the Thatcher revolution. But as the Brexiter transport secretary, Chris Grayling, is forced to take the East Coast mainline into public ownership while damning the privatised industry for neglect of passengers, there is zero appetite beyond the rightwing Brexit bunker for more rank economic failures and social inequities of Thatcherism 2.0.Last week came two more signs of its receding appeal – the stepping down of Paul Dacre as editor of Daily Mail and his replacement by Geordie Greig, tasked with detoxifying the paper, and an intriguing speech by the environment secretary, Michael Gove, damning contemporary “crony capitalism” for feathering its nest while disregarding its wider social obligations. The Brexit bonfire of EU “red tape” protecting worker rights and the environment, which was going to set the UK economy free – another fantasy – is not going to happen. Instead, outside the EU, or so this line goes, Britain is going to try to be more like Germany and the Scandinavian economies. Again, mad.As a policy, Brexit is beginning to look like the poll tax: attractive as a rightwing pet project but disastrous in practice. Then, the Tory party still had enough political nous to rescue itself, even at the cost of losing its prime minister. Now, as Johnson acknowledges and David Davis’s threatened resignation symbolised, it is at war with itself and the realists are trying to rescue a third-best solution against those in Brexit La-La land.Theresa May’s impossible mission is to reconcile Jacob Rees-Mogg and Nigel Farage’s red lines on sovereignty, freedom of movement and leaving every EU institution and trade policy, with an economy that requires the opposite. It would be hard enough with a united cabinet and years of negotiating time within the two years allowed by the article 50 process and Brexit millenarian narcissists it cannot be done.Occasionally in politics there is the opportunity to do the right thing and secure massive party advantage. If Jeremy Corbyn were to declare that the Labour party wanted to stay in the EU – crucially, only politically sellable with new and aggressive initiatives to identify, control and manage the numbers of immigrants – I feel he would transform his and his party’s standing. In part, he doesn’t because he remains transfixed by the referendum result in part because he is a Eurosceptic and in part because he sees himself as leading a social movement rather than a political party.But democracy should never stop – the people can vote again. Brexit is a proved dead end and the point of social protest is not the process of protest Corbyn so reveres, but to change things. Britain is heading towards the rocks. It is time for Labour to step up to the mark."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a2c7adfddf0b39f4f025e51b3da3b4ce4db159c3/0_314_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?w=1010\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=04867d79d593ec72a92757a80d33b7be 2020w","title":"the week in wildlife in pictures","story":"Foraging wood ducks, an adder taking a dip and a fearless baby rabbit are among this week’s pick on images from the natural world"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8e87f81d323dfcc986e5489db0a28af023925563/0_219_6580_3948/master/6580.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=67fb849648c8c97707781109992d91d3","title":"the wild workout a yorkshire coastal adventure","story":"The North York Moors national park hugs a coastline made for adventurers and the curious. Sarah Wharton tries her hand at foraging, fossil hunting, hiking and stand-up paddleboardingStay over in StaithesThe eclectic personality of Staithes reflects residents past and present. In the jumble of tiny cottages that spill down a gorge to the harbour have lived James Cook (later Captain), who came to work in a grocer’s store, and the influential Staithes group, a 19th-century artists’ group. It’s home to the Staithes festival of arts and heritage in September, and is a shoo-in for basecamp on a trip that takes in culture, natural history and a yomp. Rest up at the Endeavour B\u0026ampB, where host David Linley is a walking encyclopedia of activities, and heritage tales. He makes a mean breakfast too: don’t miss the kippers from Staithes’ own smokehouse. For dinner, try the delicious crab salad at the Royal George – like all pubs in this fishing village that’s something of a sovereign state, it’s independent and family owned. And if food and flavours really are your thing, then book a day of coastal foraging and cooking tips with Taste the Wild, which runs courses out of Staithes. Co-founder Chris Bax says: “Foraging reflects the resurgence of ersity in food: we let people rediscover things we used to eat but have dropped out of fashion.” The Attenborough in all of us will want to get closer to wildlife in an area rich in flora and fauna from moor to sky to sea. Jump aboard a birdwatching and cetacean safari with ecologist Richard Baines at Yorkshire Coast Nature (YCN) and you might just see some minke whales. Or stay grounded and snap up a seabird photography workshop with YCN’s Steve Race. Find your waveStand-up paddleboarding is “surfing without the faff of having to get up while the wave is breaking all over you,” says Simon Palmer, explorer, who co-founded SUP Adventures with Dan Fawkes. Both have that ex-military knack of turning what should be a gruelling encounter – with messy sea, two left feet or black skies – into a fun escapade and day-long grin. “People love it because it’s so accessible, irrespective of ability. It’s a terrific confidence booster if you’re anxious about getting out to learn a new activity or getting in the water. And it’s an all-body workout too.” Conquer position, posture and paddling technique at postcard-pretty Sandsend or alongside Saltburn’s trim, elegant Victorian pier. Then treat yourself to a follow-up session to learn how to read wave conditions and ride on to the beach. For something more stretchy, try SUP Adventures’ river yoga. Determined to have a Point Break moment? Head for surf spots at Staithes, where the rock bottom breaks produce powerful and defined waves (experienced surfers only). Or dip a beginner’s toe at Whitby’s West Cliff beach with Whitby Surf School. Hike into natureIf watersports aren’t your thing, then hiking along this extravagantly handsome Jurassic coastline, creaking with 200m years of stories, puritanical Victorian glamour and fishing folklore, will definitely get your heart rate up. North Yorks Moors senior ranger Bernie McLinden offers some tips: “Hayburn Wyke is a fantastic place to get to,” he says, referring to a secretish cove at the southern end of the North York Moors national park. “I was there at 7pm last night and even spotted a couple of surfers: they seemed to be having a great time.” With a waterfall that plops on to the beach, it’s a fairytale scene to take in on a circular five-mile walk that goes south along the Cleveland Way and returns along part of the Cinder Track, a defunct 21-mile railway line from Whitby to Scarborough that’s great cycling too. Another inspiring journey is the “source-to-sea” hike that picks up the river Esk at Westerdale Moor and closes at Whitby’s harbour mouth. At 37 miles, the full walk takes three or four days, but the Esk Valley railway enables you to cheat and do a day’s chunk to suit. “You might be lucky enough to see an otter along the way,” McLinden says. “At Sleights, if it’s the right time of year, you can see salmon leap. And in springtime, the woodland areas across the park are just wonderful, brimming with the beauty of the bluebells, primroses and ramsons.” Back in Staithes, if you have just 15 minutes to spare you can sprint southwards then upwards on to the cliff and a new part of the England Coast Path, to get the best view of the waterside hamlet. If you have longer, plump for a four-mile circle, taking in the industrial ironstone past of Port Mulgrave. Paddle back in timeThe Dinosaur Coast has never been more alive than when kinetic geologist, marine biologist and sailor Peter McGrath is talking about the natural kingdom that surrounds smartly turned-out Runswick Bay. He says: “One of ‘my’ best finds in 40 years came from my daughter Ruby on one of her first fossiling trips. ‘I’ve found an ammonite,’ she shouted casually. Not just any ammonite! A rare 18cm Hilderocas bifrons is a very good find.” McGrath is on a mission to discover and photograph every fossilised and living thing he can in the area, and shares his vast expertise with interested visitors as part of local firm Barefoot Kayak’s fossil foray team. If McGrath is the vim in this expedition, topping up your knowledge of fossil poo and Devil’s toenails (coprolites and Gryphaea respectively), Barefoot Kayak’s founder, paddlesport guide and coastguard Andy Monaghan provides the calm – putting the newly waterborne at ease with a deceptively laid-back style that nails safety. Paddling along with the duo is relaxing and stimulating in equal measure. Sea kayaking is manageable for most people and great for independent travellers or family groups with a yen for adventure.

Co-directed by Ian Bonhôte and Peter Ettedgui, it ides his life into chapters or “tapes” titled after his most iconic collections. It’s a thrill to relive McQueen’s shows, from Jack the Ripper Stalks His Victims to Highland Rape and Plato’s Atlantis. Their theatrics have a tense, cinematic quality, only helped by\u0026nbspMichael Nyman’s twisting, needling score.McQueen grew up daydreaming of dresses in Stratford, east London, before an apprenticeship at Anderson \u0026amp Sheppard of Savile Row that would eventually lead to a creative director role at Givenchy. Described as “funny and disrespectful”, McQueen had an equal interest in sabotage and tradition (and an obsession with Sinéad O’Connor), and was inspired by fetish culture, Francis Bacon and the grim history of London’s East End. The film does well to capture its subject’s cheekiness.Bonhôte and Ettedgui stress that he came of age at Central Saint Martins, catching the attention of soon-to-be mentor Isabella Blow, who was struck by the emotional quality of his work. By combining cheaply shot home videos of the designer goofing off in the studio with archive of his shows and talking head interviews with some of his closest colleagues (though not all – fashion heads will surely spot the omissions), the film-makers capture the impact he had on the people around him.However, this is also a film about McQueen the Londoner, surviving on unemployment benefit while he established himself and coming up in the 90s among controversial celebrity artists like Tracey Emin and Damien Hirst. Much of the film’s context is cocaine and overwork, liposuction and New Labour – a cocktail of unhappiness that drove McQueen to suicide in 2010."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cd72d57f176b10df29273c7a95d594182b1ba224/0_149_5642_3385/master/5642.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=28396dc65e86afae517df242a9668e0f","title":"rupert everett oscar wilde film the happy prince","story":"The surprised delight that met Rupert Everett’s second volume of memoir, Vanished Years, six years ago was a hint of what might be to come. The calibre of the writing matched any living diarist, according to a broad cross-section of reviewers, from Julie Burchill in the  to the ’s Robert Douglas-Fairhurst, who awarded five stars and revelled in the way the author “repeatedly slips the gears of genre, moving between scenes of farce, elegy and melodrama”. He predicted more “seriously good books” ahead, if only Everett would take himself “seriously enough”.Well, now we know exactly what Rupert wrote next – a screenplay. And his new film biography of Oscar Wilde, The Happy Prince, has wowed film critics in much the same way. To add to his triumph, Everett also produces, stars and directs, appearing alongside Colin Firth and Julian Wadham, two of his oldest theatrical buddies. “I loved working with me as an actor,” Everett quipped to red carpet reporters at the film’s London premiere last Tuesday.Yet the real love affair here is not between Everett and himself, as he regularly teases. The truly enduring relationship is with Wilde, whose plays Everett has now appeared in on stage and whom he has played in productions, and whose tragic personal story the actor has struggled for years to bring to the screen.The Happy Prince shares its title with Wilde’s melancholic children’s classic and is a sensitive, passionate tribute to a fallen literary idol. It covers the period after Wilde’s imprisonment in Reading, once he was forced to flee England. Living in near penury in the south of France in his mid-40s, he looks back at his great successes and squalid defeats at the hands of the establishment.The great Irish writer’s descendant, Merlin Holland, often called upon to judge fresh interpretations of his grandfather’s life, has already pronounced Everett’s incarnation to be the best so far. He was “terribly moved”, he told the  last week, adding, “In Oscar, there’s both the intellectual and the emotional. But, at this stage of his life, he’s living on what’s left of his emotions, and that’s where Rupert wins.”Everett first played Wilde in the Hampstead Theatre’s revival of David Hare’s play The Judas Kiss in 2012, succeeding in a role inhabited less comfortably by Liam Neeson in the original 1998 production. He went on to become the toast of the West End and then New York. The Hollywood Reporter thought Everett’s performance “deserves to become legendary”.When The Judas Kiss opened, Everett spoke candidly of his feeling for Wilde: “For me, he’s a patron saint figure, or even a Christ figure, because in one sense he was crucified and then came back to life and, for the gay movement, he was the beginning.” Later, Everett, who came out as gay in 1989, spoke of his joy at playing the part on the night gay marriage became legal in Britain.Talking to the press after the premiere, Everett downplayed his achievement, saying: “I just did it. I got on with it”, but more lyrically added that the story of this “fallen star speaks for me as well, in some strange way”.Certainly, the tone of pained nostalgia in The Happy Prince resembles passages in Vanished Years, particularly a description of lost sun-kissed months spent in the south of France, although the poignant title of Everett’s memoir actually comes from a poem by Noël Coward:When I have fears, as Keats had fears,Of the moment I’ll cease to be,I console myself with vanished years…”The book followed a 2006 memoir with the less romantic title, Red Carpets and Other Banana Skins. It was also well-received and chronicled his success at the age of 21 in the hit play Another Country.A Catholic boarding-school boy, he had run off to train as an actor, funding his fees with work as a rent boy. His early film roles peaked with Dance with a Stranger, about the Ruth Ellis case, and film industry interest was renewed in 1997, when he starred with Julia Roberts in My Best Friend’s Wedding, but faltered after his appearance opposite Madonna in the failed comedy The Next Best Thing. Treading water, Everett voiced Prince Charming in two of the Shrek movies and turned up in two St\u0026nbspTrinian’s films, before emerging recently with highly rated cameos on TV, including in Parade’s End and the comedy Quacks.His old friend Wadham remains in awe: “I have known him since he was 14 years old, when he played piano to grade 8, sang in the choir and acted. He excels at everything and has tremendous fidelity to his artistic vision and to friendship,” he said last week.Wilde and Everett also share a dangerous habit of saying what should not be said. Six years ago, when Everett naughtily cast some doubt on whether a modern child would enjoy being brought up by two gay dads, he was villified in the press. In his time, Wilde expressed equally unpalatable views about family when he wrote darkly that “children begin by loving their parents after a time they judge them rarely, if ever, do they forgive them,” though his words were recognised as a witty inversion of bland domestic cant.As a gay man who lived through the ravages of Aids in the 1980s, Everett might feel he has the right to speak. “People have forgotten about all that. It was absolute terror,” he said recently.Everett’s friends clearly feel he has earned his spurs as both a survivor and a campaigner. The soul of the new film, Wadham believes, is a moment in which Wilde unexpectedly rounds on a gang of bigots in Paris, shouting: “The natural habitat of the hypocrite is England! Go there and leave me in peace!”“This venom reflects the anger Rupert himself rightly feels for people who have that kind of prejudice and cruelty.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a6c548ced844c394adbba13452db51937559fd98/0_1540_6200_3719/master/6200.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=450f5febe1f02a91c34d31dda2a2a347","title":"toni collette hereditary interview i dont like horror films","story":"The Australian actor on her role in Hereditary, the year’s scariest movie, the joy of Muriel’s Wedding fans, and her penchant for shaving her headToni Collette is starring in what’s being billed as the most terrifying horror film in years, and she doesn’t even like horror films. Or, rather, she doesn’t know whether she likes them, because she’s too scared to watch them.We’re discussing how her new film, Hereditary, by first-time director Ari Aster, operates beyond the horror genre, bringing in other psychological dimensions, and I mention how The Shining, one of the major influences pumping through Hereditary (along with Rosemary’s Baby, The Exorcist, and The Babadook) wasn’t just about horror either, when Collette interjects: “I haven’t seen that.” I must have gaped, because she laughs and says: “I don’t like horror films.” She says she bought The Shining DVD years ago but it’s still got its wrapper on. “I’m just too petrified to watch horror films!” But you’re OK about starring in them? “I look for challenging work, and this was so complicated, layered, dense and honest. And unusual. It felt really original, even on the page. That’s what I hope for in life. And it rarely comes along.” Full of praise for Aster (who also wrote the script), Collette accepts that Hereditary is a horror film, “but it isn’t just a horror film. It’s this kind of beautiful fragile story about people living with huge amounts of emotional pain.”In the film Collette plays Annie, an artist who makes macabre “real-world” doll’s houses, and who along with her family descends into a nightmare prompted by the death of her sinister mother. Also starring Gabriel Byrne, Ann Dowd, Alex Wolff, and Milly Shapiro, it premiered in January at midnight at the Sundance film festival to great acclaim, sparking instant Oscar-buzz for Collette, which seems long overdue. In what looks to be a huge year for her, she is also starring in the hotly tipped BBCNetflix series Wanderlust this autumn, as a therapist who re-evaluates her life following a near-death experience.Since grabbing international attention in only her second role, 1994’s enduringly charming Muriel’s Wedding, Collette has starred in a wide variety of films including 1999’s The Sixth Sense (another horror film that isn’t just a horror film), Little Miss Sunshine, About A Boy, Emma, Japanese Story, and Glassland, as well as television series including United States of Tara and Tsunami: The Aftermath. She has also appeared in Broadway musicals, including The Wild Party for which she was nominated for a Tony award. (Collette also sings with her band, Toni Collette \u0026amp the Finish, featuring her husband Dave Galafassi on drums, though that’s stalled for the moment: “I’m too busy with my day job.”) However, despite garnering numerous prestigious awards and nominations, (including an Emmy and a Golden Globe for United States of Tara), there’s been no nod from the Academy since she was nominated for best supporting actress for The Sixth Sense.Perhaps Hereditary will change all that. Collette is long-renowned for her expressiveness, with a particularly strong suit in “everywomen” who turn out to be anything but – it’s almost as though her molecules reassemble for every new role. In Hereditary she goes all out, emoting brittle, grief-stricken, broken, resolute, angry, frustrated, and everything in between. When I speak to Aster on the phone, he says that choosing Collette was “a no-brainer. She always struck me as a chameleon, disappearing into whatever role she was in.” Aster also liked the fact that Collette hadn’t done anything like Hereditary before: “Everyone knows that Toni is wonderful and amazing, but it’s seldom that we’ve seen her really tear apart the scenery in the way that this film demanded. She’s playing someone very tortured and conflicted, and really jumps off at the deep end. I told her that I was looking for a kamikaze performance, and she delivered.”We meet at a central London hotel, where Collette, 45, is enduring what must be a packed, exhausting publicity schedule, and, despite her reservations about horror, seeing Hereditary again at London Sundance (good luck to her – towards the end it becomes too full-on and gory even for my tastes). When Collette gets up from her seat to greet me, it’s a lightning flash of huge blue eyes, wide distinctive smile, biscuit-tan and sandy blond hair. Her striking clothes, including a Victorian-style top and long sculptured skirt, lend her a wonderfully sub-gothic air, a bit like a sun-kissed Miss Havisham. (“No,” she says, later, “I was never a goth.”)Engaged, friendly, open, with an unexpected splash of new age beach hippy in the mix, there’s just one point toward the end of our conversation when Collette becomes distracted and fidgety. I’m starting to wonder whether she dislikes the questions (or me), when she suddenly slaps her hands on her knees, and cries: “I REALLY have to pee! I’m so sorry, I had a bunch of waters. Would you please excuse me?” She dashes out of the room, returning a little later, restored to her chatty self. Elsewhere, a couple of times, a flicker of jet-lagged weariness pinches her features. When I ask if she’s looking forward to returning to her native Australia (to her home, in Sydney, with Galafassi and their two children, daughter Sage, 10, and son Arlo, 7), she mock-dramatically sags her shoulders, and hisses “Yes-sss!” with a ferocity that seems only partly in jest.One intriguing thing about Hereditary is how dominant, disparate, and sometimes dislikable all the female characters are. If anyone takes on the soothing nurturing “caretaker” role, it’s Byrne. Collette’s Annie is far from the generic “good (bland) mom” figure so often seen in films. “I love that,” says Collette. “It just turns this kind of idyllic idealised myth of what it is to be a mother completely on its head. She’s so real and multilayered. It’s so rare to play a woman that feels as complicated as she does.”Collette has played several on-screen mothers – what kind of mum is she in real life? “Well, I think there’s no one way of being, we are all many things. Also, life has changed, so those things keep changing too. So it’s hard to say without simplifying one of the most profound relationships one can have. And I try to bring that message to all the mothers that I play – yes, they’re mothers, but they’re whole complex creatures on their own.” And her children? “My kids are the most important people in my life, I’m entirely in love with them. But I don’t own them, they’re not reflective of me. I just try to guide them, to support them, be there, give them as much as I can, without being in any way dogmatic or didactic. And I learn from them, it’s entertaining. They’re very much their own people.” She smiles: “If you start to break anything down, it becomes more and more complicated, doesn’t it?”Collette was raised with two brothers, in a suburb of Sydney, as part of a close-knit working-class family. “I can’t imagine my life without my parents,” she says. “They’re such a huge part of who I am, and they’ve overcome so much, and been so selfless.” Collette’s maternal grandmother died giving birth to another child, and Collette’s father was sent to Vietnam. “A lot of people still don’t know that Australians were involved in that war,” says Collette. “And he was drafted, he wasn’t in the army – he had the wrong birthday, and suddenly he’s got a gun on his back and heading off. It was terrifying, and he was just a teenager.” Did her father ever talk about it? “A little bit, as much as he felt able. It still affects…” She pauses: “With vets, it still lives with them, you know. It’s in there.” She presses her hands to her chest. “The body absorbs so much. It lives with you.”One odd feature of Collette’s childhood was when she convinced everybody that she had appendicitis, which ended with her having an operation to remove the healthy organ. “Some people say, ‘Oh, that was your first role’, but it was nothing to do with acting. My mother had told me that her appendix was removed when she was 11, and I thought, ‘Well, I’m 11 now, I’ll give this a shot’, and it just kept going. Then it was too late.” It sounds almost like Munchausen syndrome, but Collette says that she didn’t fake the symptoms: “I felt pain in my stomach, and it just kind of escalated. Obviously, I didn’t understand what I was doing, I was 11.” Now she just finds the whole incident mortifying: “I’ve always thought that I’m not one of those cliched actors who got into it because they need attention. But perhaps there is an element of that? How embarrassing!”Her parents allowed her to leave school at 16 and pursue acting, which sounds brave of them, and very determined of her. “They were really concerned when I decided to leave school and be an actress. Can you imagine hearing that from your teenage daughter? That’s a horror film in itself!” She’s described her youthful self as having “crazy” amounts of confidence. “I had this knowledge within me that this is it, this is what I need to do. I was just very strong-willed. I didn’t let any negativity or fear get in the way. I was so clear and positive about what I was trying to do. It didn’t mean that I didn’t feel nervous or inadequate. But a door would open, and I put a foot in, and suddenly the door was completely open, and it just kept happening.”Was it blind confidence, in a way? “Yeah, but that’s fine, it got me going. If I was in the same position now, I know more about life and the world, and I wouldn’t make the same decisions, but at that point there was something so pure about my bravery.”This single-mindedness led to Collette’s breakthrough in Muriel’s Wedding, and an international career. (She lived in London for a while, and says she still views it as her second home.) People still quote Muriel’s Wedding dialogue at her – in fact, I nearly do (“You’re terrible, Muriel”), but I restrain myself – it could be the 10th time she’s heard it today! But Collette says it never gets irritating. “I’m so fond of that experience and that character. It’s 25 years ago! When you go into a film, you connect to something and hope for the best. But to have that kind of reaction for what seems to be for ever is incredible.”In her 20s, early success, on top of the usual stresses of being a young woman, threatened to overwhelm her, and Collette developed bulimia and suffered panic attacks. In retrospect, she thinks there was just a lot of change going on in her life, perhaps too much. “For most people, change can be very confronting.” She found the publicity side of her job particularly difficult: “I was unformed, a baby, working on instinct, and suddenly I had to form ideas and have opinions on everything, and not just conversationally and privately, these things were plastered everywhere. I had to grow up very quickly.”I’d read somewhere that losing the weight she’d gained to play Muriel triggered her bulimia, but Collette thinks not: “I don’t think it was in a direct response to putting on weight for the film. Anything like that is more about control. My life did feel a little… fast. And I guess that was my way of pathetically trying to deal with it.” Well, that happens. “It does happen – it’s really common. And I’m sorry for the person that I was then. It just feels like another human being.”She suffered panic attacks for several months. “But I haven’t had them since. You know how I was talking before about how the body absorbs everything? So, even if you can’t look at something, or address things in an open way, it does catch up with you. Your body will go: ‘Hello, I’m here, you do need to look at this!’ I think that’s what panic attacks are. I wouldn’t wish one on my worst enemy.” What does a panic attack feel like? “Erm, you basically feel like you’re dying. It’s not just being a little bit nervous, it’s deep, deep anxiety.” When I say it sounds as though it was a very dark period for her, she demurs: “Not all of it. I wouldn’t paint it that way. That was part of my life, but I was also having the time of my life. I was in my 20s, that’s what that decade is for, I guess.”Collette also developed a penchant for shaving her head, but that seems to be more of a positive thing: “I’ve shaved my head five times in my life. I find it very cleansing.” Is it a stylefashion thing? “Not at all. It’s for me. It feels like a clean slate. I did it for a friend’s fashion show, I did it for a film, I did it for two films actually. But the first time I did it, I turned 25, I was in Mexico, I’d had probably too much tequila, and I walked past a barber, and I looked at this guy, I looked at his chubby fingers, and I thought: ‘I trust him, I’m going in!’ So, it was on my 25th birthday, I decided to shave my head.”She grins: “The third or fourth time I shaved it, it was about three days after meeting my husband. I think it was, like: I’m just going to see how he reacts. It was like a test. Which is ridiculous.” It was a test he obviously passed? “Yes!” Was it your way of saying: this is me, unadorned? “Yeah, I suppose so.” When I ask if she has any tattoos, she confirms that she has several. Would you say that you’re impulsive, in a good way? You like to stir things up, just for yourself? She looks thoughtful: “Yeah, I think it’s good to do that.”Certainly, there seems to be a key element of not so much impulse as instinct in how she chooses roles. She says that it’s always the writing that first attracts her, but aside from that, “it’s beyond something cerebral. If I start to think about it too much, and I’m on the fence, umm-ing and ahh-ing, then I know it’s not for me. Because it’s usually very immediate, a visceral gut knowledge that…” She makes her eyes pop fiercely. “I’ve got to do it.”Didn’t you once say that if you couldn’t act, you would wither and die? “That was probably a very old thing that I said. I think, initially, I used acting as a way to express myself. I was very good at seeing other things very clearly, and I saw myself less clearly. And there were times when I felt overwhelmed by my own emotions. So acting became a way of accessing those emotions and doing something positive and creative with them.” A form of catharsis? “It is catharsis. But that was when I was much younger. My relationship with acting has changed, and deepened, and continued to change. That’s inevitable.”Collette was speaking out about issues such as body image and female representation in Hollywood long before the recent explosion with Harvey Weinstein and MeTooTime’s Up. She tells me she’s always enjoyed working with female directors (“I just wanted to work with great directors of either sex”). Has she ever experienced harassment in the industry? “No.” Would she define herself as a feminist? “I would say that I’m both a feminist and a humanist. I believe in equality, I always have. So, the idea that this behaviour has been occurring…” She sighs. “It’s not a new thing. But it’s just so incredible, and it’s so necessary, and actually exciting, that people are speaking out about it now. It takes a conversation for there to be action and change.”Collette feels that it’s bigger than her industry, it’s society at large. “There’s a huge imbalance – and there has been for longer than my lifetime.” She also thinks that there’s been a genuine change of attitude in Hollywood. “You need awareness to be able to make a change, and you can’t help but be aware of it now.” What about unrealistic beautybody image ideals – this idea that, with women, it’s first and foremost about the visuals? “Well, that’s bullshit! I’ve never believed that. And I think, if that’s been the notion, which I know it has, it’s an archaic notion now.”As the interview winds up, we discuss her future projects, including Wanderlust written by British playwright Nick Payne, which will air on BBC One this autumn, in which she plays a woman whose brush with death makes her question her life, including her commitment to monogamy. “But it’s beyond that – it’s about what’s informing her decisions. So, even though I’m playing a therapist who’s very astute and aware, she has her own awakening of sorts. It’s a perfectly woven psychological web,” says Collette with relish.These days, she would work in Australia all the time, if she could, just for family reasons. She’s often described herself as “nomadic”. Is that grating a bit now? “It’s not grating. We’re all adaptable. My family has moved around so much, but we know that home is Sydney. It’s just a feeling, you can’t help it, there’s only one home. And my parents aren’t getting any younger. My tribe is there, and there’s a kind of calling to return.”Collette has her own production company, writes, adapts material, and has her eye on directing. “I want to be involved earlier in the creative process,” she says. “As an artist, and even as a human, you need to challenge yourself and grow. You never stop learning. It keeps me curious, open, awake and alive. All of those exciting good things.” But acting still challenges her? “Of course!” she says, widening her eyes. “It’s still self-expression, you still have to make it feel honest for the audience to believe it. It’s a matter of empathy and understanding. I think, if anything, that’s what drives me – trying to understand what life is. It’s all a mystery.”Hereditary is in UK cinemas from Friday, and out now in the US and Australia"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1e9a501e825c264d0919bc00689e8965765f0cec/183_294_2990_1794/master/2990.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b208d5d2503fb42e529b59dfc87c0547","title":"world cup russia 2018 england messi ronaldo","story":"Restrained hopes around Gareth Southgate’s side are a good thing in a tournament that represents the last chance for two greats to join Maradona and Pelé in the World Cup pantheonAt least this time nobody has fallen into the trap of thinking England might actually win the damn thing. Nobody inside the England camp has proclaimed they are going to Russia to bring the trophy back home. And perhaps just as important, nobody in the media is feverishly backing our boys to do it. Not yet, anyway.Instead, the mood seems restrained compared to previous tournaments, as if the penny has dropped that England have not done a great deal in the World Cup since the year – the one between 1965 and 1967 – that Jürgen Klopp has suggested we no longer mention because of the pressure it puts on the team.Sensible advice bearing in mind England’s footballers have managed a grand total of six wins in the knockout stages of major international tournaments since, well, That Year Again. The last one was 12 years ago, against Ecuador, and if all this sounds downbeat it’s difficult, in fairness, to be a cheerleader when the most recent memory of England in a major tournament is Iceland’s Viking thunderclap, Harry Kane’s corner-taking and the mutinous chants of “You’re not fit to wear the shirt” from Euro 2016.Roy Hodgson’s reign as England manager ended within minutes of that defeat to Iceland and he spent the night in a corner of the bar of the team’s hotel in Chantilly, with nobody else around and the lights off. The next day, when he was persuaded to speak to the media, the top three buttons of his shirt were undone, his hands were trembling and his fingernails were bitten to the quick.Alternatively, there’s the memory of Steven Gerrard at the 2014 World Cup, when England were eliminated inside a week and left Brazil before the players had even finished their course of anti-malaria tablets. Gerrard hadn’t slept much either. He was “hurting bad, broken”. England’s captain sat silently – dark smudges under his eyes, a week’s worth of stubble – staring into the distance as Hodgson talked about a “period of grieving”.Let’s not be too negative, though. England have some talented players, and indeed a sprinkling of excellent ones, and at the time of writing nobody has been struck down by the curse of the metatarsal just yet. Yes, Gareth Southgate’s team have been drawn against Belgium, third in Fifa’s world rankings, but there are more obliging games, against Panama and Tunisia, first. If those can be won, England will already be assured of a place in the knockout stages before they meet Kevin De Bruyne, Eden Hazard et al.Nothing can be taken for granted, of course, given the ordeal against Iceland nudges out the defeat to the USA in the 1950 World Cup as the most mortifying result in England’s history. Likewise, it does not feel too long ago since the Sun splashed with an “E-A-S-Y” front‑page headline after the 2010 World Cup draw to let us know it would be England against Algeria, Slovenia and – to make it work – the Yanks. England stank out that tournament, too.It does help, though, that expectations this time are more realistic. Kyle Walker has said England will need a “miracle” to get their hands on the trophy in Moscow and it puts things into context to imagine the runaround Southgate’s team would likely be given by a France XI made up of players Les Bleus have left out.When Southgate named his squad the only controversies were the absence of Jack Wilshere and Jonjo Shelvey. Didier Deschamps, the France manager, has omitted Alexandre Lacazette, Anthony Martial and Karim Benzema, not to mention Dimitri Payet, Aymeric Laporte, Kingsley Coman and others who would be mandatory picks for most other teams.France will take some beating but so will Brazil, Germany and all the other usual suspects. Otherwise, there will be two players in particular who are determined to make a lasting impression. Lionel Messi will be 35 when the World Cup is held in Qatar in 2022. Cristiano Ronaldo will be 37. Between them, they have won the Ballon d’Or 10 times. Yet, realistically, this will be the last opportunity these two modern greats get to make a decisive impact on this stage.Can one of these two showmen be remembered for Russia 2018 in the same way that Diego Maradona is for Mexico 1986, Pelé in 1970 and so on? Messi was named the best player of the last World Cup. It felt generous at the time and, harsh as it may sound, the fact is we are still waiting for a truly Messi-inspired tournament.As for England, it does not feel too outlandish to imagine Southgate’s team navigating a route to the quarter-finals. The problem is that Brazil or Germany could be waiting and that is usually the point when we are reminded, as John Cleese once put it, that the nation that invented the sport has barely seen a penny in royalties ever since.All of which means it is probably not such a bad thing that the English football public is hardened to disappointment. Serial disappointments, indeed. Two more of these tournaments, on the back of this one, and the chances are it will be 30 years since “30 years of hurt” became part of the soundtrack."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e6ab7acd033e4e607b5cdf24d54f0d75e0aa219/0_12_2738_1643/master/2738.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e5afaea210582849d1e77c4d8b8c3a0e","title":"world cup tv guide presenters pundits whats on","story":"With matches running from 11am to 9pm BST and highlights shows on top, there’s a lot to watch. Here’s how it all breaks downEnglish football fans have spurned the chance to visit Russia in their droves. According to Fifa, more match tickets have been sold to Peruvians than they have to fans of England, the UK’s sole representatives at the tournament. The English are staying at home and perhaps that’s to do with the political climate, or maybe the substantial cost. It’s also worth considering, however, that they’re expressing the conscious preference to watch the World Cup in the company of Clive Tyldesley.ITV and the BBC are sharing the rights for World Cup 2018, which means UK viewers can once again enjoy one of the more genial rivalries in broadcasting. With matches running from 11am to 9pm and highlights shows on top, there’s a lot to watch. Here’s how it all breaks down.Gary Lineker will helm the BBC’s coverage, as he has in every tournament since before records began. He’ll be joined by Gabby Logan, who’ll be keeping an eye on England for however long they’re there, alongside Dan Walker and Jason Mohammad, who will have roving briefs. ITV continue their controversial policy of having an actual journalist in charge of proceedings, with Mark Pougatch sitting in the big chair. The former BBC commentator Jacqui Oatley will be alongside him, while the reporters include the veteran Gabriel Clarke and rising star Seema Jaswal.The big news is that ITV have Gary Neville. The Sky pundit has been poached for the summer by Pougatch and co, as has Match of the Day’s Ian Wright. In fact, given that most pundits are sole traders, there’s a lot of channel switching going on: the BBC have BT Sport’s Rio Ferdinand and Frank Lampard, too. In the “popular pundits who only appear at tournaments” department, we’ll see Martin O’Neill and Slaven Bilic on ITV, while the Beeb have Jürgen Klinsmann. In welcome ersification-from-all-those-blokes news, the impressive Alex Scott is part of the BBC team, while there will be intrigue around Eni Aluko’s addition to the ITV corpus. And in the wildcard department? That’s Didier Drogba for the BBC and Mr Instagram, Patrice Evra, on ITV.We’ve mentioned Tyldesley already and he’ll be joined on ITV by Sam Matterface and Jon Champion. Glenn Hoddle, Ally McCoist and Iain Dowie will be ITV’s co-commentators. The BBC’s lineup will be equally familiar, with Guy Mowbray joined by Jonathan Pearce, Simon Brotherton et al, but there is also a slot for Vicki Sparks, who will become the first woman to commentate at a World Cup on British TV. Mark Lawrenson and Kevin Kilbane co-commentate.Since Euro 2012 the channels have agreed to take it in turns to have first pick of matches, and this time it’s the Beeb’s go. That means they get two of England’s group matches, against Tunisia and Panama, while ITV get the opening match and all the pomp and grandeur that Russia v Saudi Arabia entails. ITV get the first two picks in the round of 16 and Auntie the first pick of the quarters (i.e. England, should they get that far). ITV pick up their preferred choice of the semis, then the pair come together in the traditional, pointless act of showing the final on both channels.Not meaning to demean the wireless by listing it all the way down here, but the BBC have it all to themselves so you don’t have much of a choice. Mark Chapman and Kelly Cates head up the coverage on 5 Live, which will be live – the clue’s in the name – from every match. There’s a strong list of co-commentators in Chris Waddle, Terry Butcher, Dion Dublin, Chris Sutton and Pat Nevin, but sadly Robbie Savage is getting his own breakfast show.There’s this thing called the internet and people are putting content onto it. ITV will serve up 10 podcasts helmed by Pougatch and Oatley alongside a coterie of guests (though obviously they won’t be a patch on our daily Football Weekly shows). More interestingly, perhaps, they will look to recreate the highlights of the tournament through the medium of freestyle football with performers the F2. The Beeb meanwhile have put Alex Scott in charge of their Instagram stories and will put highlights from every game on YouTube."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d760caf969f29eb8c44ce523302ab3435c3eef90/0_1495_3208_1924/master/3208.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d33c8dc8485d2c9166869e75717130b7","title":"i was 19 gay and ready to be cured by conversion therapy","story":"Born into a Baptist family, Garrard Conley was sent for conversion therapy to ‘treat’ his sexual identity. As his brave and bracing memoir is adapted into a film, he reveals why he still believes he is ‘one of the lucky ones’Here’s what Garrard Conley had to surrender the morning he arrived at the Love in Action facility in Memphis, Tennessee in 2004: his phone, his wallet, his driving licence and a Moleskine journal in which he wrote his short stories. A blond boy confiscated the journal and yanked a bunch of pages free from the binding. “And he said, in a voice free of emotion: ‘False Image’,” recalls Conley in Boy Erased, his elegant memoir about the year in which his southern Baptist upbringing collided with his sexual awakening as a gay man.“False Image”, a key tenet of Love in Action (LIA), referred to anything and everything suggestive of Conley’s homosexuality. Detecting and destroying FIs was how you got the gay out. “The concept is stolen from Alcoholics Anonymous, except AA doesn’t just have you stay in a place all day, monitored,” says Conley. He was 19 when he entered LIA for a two-week evaluation. That was 14 years ago, the year – his mother likes to joke – in which they were abducted by aliens, a metaphor for the hallucinatory nature of the family’s crisis, when Conley’s father gave him an ultimatum: “You’ll never set foot in this house again if you act on your feelings. You’ll never finish your education.” Conley’s response was: “Fair enough.” There was nothing fair about it, of course, but if your father was a Billy Graham-loving southern Baptist minister and you’d been raised to believe that hell was real, and if you’d grown up in a world in which pastors preach that evolution is a Satanic lie, perhaps you, too, would consider same-sex attraction to be a sickness. “That whole environment was just permeated with what my parents believed was a literal interpretation of the Bible,” Conley says when we meet at a café in New York, where he now lives. “It’s hard for me to reconstruct because it was so familiar to me for so long and now it feels so distant.”Torture is a strong word, but if we get a museum that honours the centuries of suffering inflicted on queer people, a whole wing will need to be dedicated to that unique form of persecution known as conversion, or reparative, therapy, by which zealots acting under the banner of faith have sought to turn one sexual instinct into another. Conley’s story is far from unique, and far from the worst. In the US, research suggests that 700,000 adults have undergone such treatment, about half of them as teenagers. The methods are cruel and frequently violent, from applying electric shocks while being forced to watch gay porn, to mind control games aimed at persuading LGBT “patients” their desires are rooted in dysfunctional or “disempowering” relationships with their mothers.At LIA the message was unequivocal: homosexuality meant unhappiness, isolation and death. Conley recounts a story in which a 19-year-old “defector” was forced to submit to a mock funeral, as other members read out his obituary, describing his slow decline into HIV and then Aids. Stories like these were not uncommon at LIA, renamed Restoration Path in 2012, and widely considered to be the first modern “ex-gay” ministry predicated on changing the sexual orientation of gay men and women. Among the first to raise the alarm about its methods was founding member John Evans, who left in 1975 after a friend, distraught by his failure to convert to straight, killed himself. “They’re destroying people’s lives,” he told the Wall Street Journal in 1993. “If you don’t do their thing, you’re not of God, you’ll go to hell. They’re living in a fantasy world.” When Conley handed over his notebook that day, it was part of a series of rules and prohibitions designed to maximise LIA’s mind control over patients during their treatment and beyond. Other rules included restrictions on where residents could travel within Memphis, on their dressing and grooming (no “muscle shirts” no sideburns “below the top of the ear”) and on how they engaged with the secular world (no listening to Beethoven or Bach, or entering “non-Christian bookshops”, for example). Women were forbidden to wear “mannishboyish” clothes, whatever that might mean, and men had to avoid “campy” behaviour. Conley later gave his LIA handbook to the law firm McDermott, Will \u0026amp Emery, which works with the Mattachine Society of Washington, DC to archive LGBTQ history. “They took my book and analysed it to see whether it matched what they knew about cults, and it did,” says Conley. “Of course, I knew it operated as a cult, on some level, but it was still a shock. LIA felt like everything I’d ever encountered in my youth, only more distilled and written down.”Today Conley seems relaxed and loose, attuned to himself and his place in the world, with quick, amused eyes. But it took effort for him to get to this point. “Every time I’ve read a book or ingested a new historical fact that my Baptist upbringing taught me to reject, I’ve had to fight against the sneaking suspicion that I am being led astray by Satan,” he says. Like other gay teens, Conley went through the motions of having a girlfriend as a way to “cure” himself, but he was also a voracious reader who found in novels a counterweight to the Bible that helped expand the horizons of his world. “I always say literature saved my life – it’s the one dogmatic thing I can say,” he says. “It sounds silly now, but I believed that these writers were speaking to me.” He recalls the experience of reading Nathaniel Hawthorne’s The Scarlet Letter in college as “like an electric current flowing through me”, and became convinced that the novelist was creating a metaphor for LGBTQ people in the character of Hester Prynne – forced to wear the scarlet letter for the crime of infidelity. At a small liberal arts college in Arkansas, freed from smalltown bigotries, Conley found himself caught between the tug of his upbringing, on the one hand, and his new freedoms on the other. He withdrew from church, wore a Radiohead T-shirt, read Dostoevsky and Gertrude Stein and defended evolution in conversations with a fellow student, whom he calls David, while fantasising about how their bodies might feel curled into one another. Instead, David raped Conley in his dorm room later that day. “I’d been unable to move from the bed where he had placed me afterwards – I believed that God was punishing me physically for my mental transgressions,” writes Conley. A few weeks later, David called Conley’s mother and outed her son. “David had trumped me. The knowledge of my homosexuality would seem more shocking than the knowledge of my rape or, worse, it would seem as though one act had inevitably followed the other, as though I’d had it coming to me.” Conley is gentle on his parents, and in general reluctant to judge anyone involved. “I question whether or not I do it out of stubbornness or actual compassion,” he says. “Given my experiences, I’m very resistant to having people tell me what I should believe, and so I don’t like easy routes out.” He finds liberal handwringing almost as obnoxious as conservative pieties. “I’ve met many nice liberal audiences that have had no experience of those smaller places, and who are completely incredulous – very well-meaning, but maddening, too, because this is a lot of the country,” he says. “It shouldn’t come as a shock. Look at who we elected.”In many ways, Conley’s parents are southern clichés – his father a quarterback in high school, his mother a cheerleader, both deeply religious. They married young. But Conley is too thoughtful a writer to let such clichés escape scrutiny. In Boy Erased he gives his parents histories. He lets us know that his father grew up watching his own father tie his mother to a chair in order to beat her. He shows his mother’s capacity for humour. In Memphis one evening, suffocating under the rigid disciplines imposed by LIA, she essentiallyjailbreaks him by leaving the “approved” Hampton Inn they are staying at during his two-week evaluation, for dinner at a fancy hotel in an off-limits section of Memphis. There, she jokes about an idea for a TV series, Preachers’ Wives Gone Wild, while he surreptitiously observes their handsome waiter.Among the ironies of conversion therapies such as LIA is the fact that they are run and managed largely by gay men who have been through the programme themselves, renounced their past and now seek to make others do the same. Conley characterises them by their “ex-gay smiles” in which the corners of their lips “stretched beyond the limits of normalcy”.One such person was John Smid, former executive director of LIA and a gay man and Christian who would eventually admit that he’d “never met a man who experienced a change from homosexual to heterosexual”. Today Smid lives in Paris, Texas in a same-sex marriage. But when Conley met him in 2004, he was a diehard proselytiser for conversion. It was his idea to expand LIA’s mission from adults to teenagers. Although compassionate towards well-meaning parents who sent their children to places like LIA, Conley struggles to find such generosity for Smid. “We did become close many years later, and I was able to understand his story, but I also feel he should be spending every day of his life trying to raise awareness for what he did, and apologising to the families he affected,” he says. “My family never got that apology.”Today Conley believes his father has come to accept his homosexuality, but the wounds are not entirely healed. “Everyone’s feelings are just very hurt,” he admits. “My dad feels that I don’t understand the pressure that he has from all of this. The community has disinvited him from certain revivals because my name comes up, he’s lost members who just walked out. Meanwhile, my mom’s stuck in this in-between, between a very fundamentalist preacher husband and a left-leaning queer son and that’s not a good place to be in.” He compares his father’s beliefs to a game of Jenga – in which players take turns removing pieces from a tower of wooden blocks until the structure collapses. “All his tenets are at the bottom, and it feels very solid, but if you move one block, everything becomes unbalanced. And the one he can’t move, that would bring it all down, is homosexuality, because it’s all tied in to the literal interpretation of the Bible.” He understands why liberal Americans make fun of places like his home city of Mountain Home, a small Arkansas town in the Ozarks, but he also finds the stereotypes about working-class America – from either direction – silly and unhelpful.Meanwhile, the man who was saved by books now gets weekly affidavits of the impact his own book, first published in the US in 2016, is making. “This kid sent me this beautiful letter about how he found my book in his local library and couldn’t bring it home because his parents would see it, so he would read it in small increments until he finished it,” he says. “It was one of the most beautifully written letters I’ve read. He said, ‘I think I’m going to get through this, but it’s just really hard and I don’t know how to.’ It made me sob, so I sent it to my publicist, and she sent it to my editor and they decided to send him all these books, with a note to say it had been won in a sweepstake. Every book had a gay character in it, but it wasn’t obvious – you couldn’t tell from the blurbs.”Boy Erased has been adapted into a film, due for release this autumn. Directed by Joel Edgerton, it stars Russell Crowe as Conley’s father and Nicole Kidman as his mother. Early last autumn, as filming commenced, a producer called Conley to ask if he knew where Russell Crowe was. “How the fuck would I know where Russell Crowe is?” he replied. “Isn’t he on set?” He wasn’t, as it turned out. Instead, Crowe had taken a private plane to Mountain Home to attend a Baptist service led by Conley’s father. “My dad called up two hours later, and he said: ‘Well, you’ll never guess what just happened,’ and I said, ‘Did Russell Crowe just show up at your church?’” Conley laughs uncomfortably at the memory. “It made a little bit of a scene – it’s a very small town, a lot of people have been on meth,” he says. “And then Russell Crowe comes in with his entourage and sits down. I was told my dad paused in his sermon for about two minutes, before continuing.” Crowe went to great lengths to study Conley’s father, even coming away from Mountain Home with his lapel pin, a wooden cross from the Galilee, that he wore throughout filming. On set he sent a case of watches to Conley, asking him to select the one his dad might wear. “Of course, I didn’t know,” laughs Conley. “I just knew my dad didn’t ever want anything skinny because it made him too effeminate, so I chose one of those big watch bands.” Conley, happily married to his husband since February 2017, has recently finished his first novel, set in the early 19th century during the Second Great Awakening, when America was galvanised by a wave of religious revival meetings. It’s been a relief, he says, not to be writing about himself any more. “I’ve reached the limit,” he says. “I’ve been talking about this non-stop. I care about the issue, but I’ve just got to take a break. It’s like re-traumatising yourself every time.” It’s been 14 years since Conley checked himself out of LIA and called his mother to take him home. “I didn’t have to leave my parents behind,” he says.

The rest of us sat in a semicircle facing him, all dressed according to the dress code outlined in our 274-page handbooks. Men: Shirts worn at all times, including periods of sleep. T-shirts without sleeves not permitted, whether worn as outer- or undergarments, including ‘muscle shirts’ or other tank tops. Facial hair removed seven days weekly. Sideburns never below top of ear. Women: Bras worn at all times, exceptions during sleep. Skirts must fall at the knee or below. Tank tops allowed only if worn with a blouse. Legs and underarms shaved at least twice weekly. ‘The first thing you have to do is recognise how you’ve become dependent on sex, on things that are not from God,’ Smid said. We were learning Step One of Love in Action’s 12-Step programme, a set of principles equating the sins of infidelity, bestiality, paedophilia and homosexuality to addictive behavior such as alcoholism or gambling: a kind of Alcoholics Anonymous for what counsellors referred to as our ‘sexual deviance’. An orange sun was climbing its way up the back of the hazy white-washed buildings in the distance. I waited for the sunlight to spill over, but the longer I watched, the longer it seemed to take. I wondered if this was how time was going to work in this place: minutes as hours, hours as days, days as weeks. ‘Once you enter the group, you’ll be well on your way to recovery,’ Smid said. ‘The important thing to remember is to keep an open mind.’ I was here by my own choice, despite my growing scepticism, despite my secret wish to run away from the shame I’d felt since my parents found out I was gay. I had too much invested in my current life to leave it behind: in my family and in the increasingly blurry God I’d known since I was a toddler. God, I prayed, making my way down the narrow hallway to the main room, the fluorescents ticking in their metal grids, I don’t know who You are any more, but please give me the wisdom to survive this."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c17d22f40fb27aafc9235311d8e45db2941d7217/518_350_3290_1973/master/3290.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=51bb0b2c27a5b689a8c778e51a675311","title":"nigel slater lemon thyme water ice apricot sorbet pistachio cookies recipes","story":"Soothing, sweet and piquant desserts to round off a lovely summer lunchAfter lunch, the table still scattered with crumbs, squeezed lemons and the shrapnel from the shells of a pile of grilled langoustines, we brought out fruit water ices to eat in the late afternoon shade. There was a sorbet of apricots, barely frozen, the colour of the setting sun, and another vivid with lemon and thyme. The sorbets cooled our tongues after the heat of the shellfish and for five minutes there was blissful silence.You don’t need an ice cream machine to make sorbets, but having access to one will give a smoother texture. If you haven’t got one, just remember to give the fruit purée a stir every hour as it freezes. Folding the frozen surface and those sparkling outer edges that are first to freeze into the middle will produce an ice akin to one which has been churned.It was one day last week, cooking lamb cutlets over a smoking grill, that I crushed a bunch of lemon thyme in my hand and mentioned, only half seriously, that I would love to make an ice cream with something of the resinous-citrus flavour of that herb. This week I had a go. The idea that it was going to taste of something more than lemon came as I tasted the syrup in which I had stuffed a handful of sprigs and let it sit for an hour to take up the herb’s essential oils. I used fresh lemons as well, fat ones from my local Turkish greengrocer with their reassuringly glossy leaves and unexpected thorns.The second ice was one I have tried to make before, but was disappointed by its lack of depth. Apricot is a tricky flavour to harness. The trick is to roast the fruit, allowing it to cook almost to the point of collapse, its amber flesh caramelising in the process. The flavour, second time round, was that fleeting thing, a truly ripe apricot warmed by the sun.Put the sugar in a small, heavy-based saucepan, pour in the water and place over a moderate heat. Using a vegetable peeler, remove the peel from the lemon in thin strips, push into the sugar and water and bring to the boil, stirring occasionally, until the sugar has dissolved.Rinse the bunch of lemon thyme under cold running water, bash it lightly with a rolling pin, then push it down into the syrup with a spoon, cover with a lid and leave to cool. Refrigerate until thoroughly cold. You could speed up the infusion by putting the pan into a large bowl of ice.Remove the pan from the fridge and lift out the bunch of lemon thyme, shaking it as you go. Don’t worry if some of the leaves fall off into the syrup. Pour the lemon juice into the syrup, then pour into the bowl of an ice cream machine and churn until almost frozen. Transfer to a plastic freezer box and freeze till needed.To make the ice without a machine, pour the syrup and lemon juice into a plastic freezer box and mix thoroughly. Freeze for 2 hours, then stir and return to the freezer. Continue freezing and occasionally stirring until frozen.Serves 6apricots 600gcaster sugar 200gwater 200mllemon juice of 1Set the oven at 200Cgas mark 6. Halve and stone the apricots and put them, cut side up, in a nonstick roasting tin or baking dish. Scatter half the sugar over them and roast for about 20 minutes, checking the sugar has melted and is browning, but not burning. Remove from the oven when the apricots are fully soft and the syrup is golden. While the apricots are roasting, put the remaining sugar into a small saucepan with the water and lemon juice and bring to the boil. Remove from the heat as soon as the sugar has dissolved and leave to cool.Tip the apricots and their roasting juices into a food processor and blend to a smooth purée then pour in the cooled syrup and combine. Transfer the apricot mixture to an ice-cream machine and churn until almost frozen, before scooping into a freezer box, covering tightly and freezing until needed.To make the sorbet without a machine, pour the apricot mixture into a plastic freezer box and mix thoroughly.

It’s a move that could further destabilise relations between Iran and the west and begin a nuclear arms race in the Middle East. The Ayatollah followed up with tweets saying Israel was a “cancerous tumor” that must be “removed and eradicated”.How did the Israeli embassy in the United States respond to this potential doomsday scenario? With a Regina George gif from Mean Girls:It’s the latest case of countries acting like warring reality TV stars, using gifs and memes to send “shade” across borders.’Take the Crimean peninsula, where armed conflict has been simmering between Ukrainian and Russian forces since 2014. The war has often been bloody, but online, the countries have been sparring in more jovial terms. Last month, the official national Twitter accounts of the respective countries were arguing over who could lay claim to the 11th-century French monarch Anne de Kiev. Annoyed that @Russia was claiming that a monarch born in Kiev was Russian, @Ukraine posted a gif taken from an episode of The Simpsons in which the Russian ambassador to the UN flicks around a “Russia” nameplate to read “Soviet Union”.It’s not the first time Ukraine has used TV gifs to wind up Russia. When the country expelled 13 Russian diplomats following the Salisbury attack in the UK, in which a former KGB agent and his daughter were poisoned, Ukraine enlisted the support of The Master from Doctor Who to wave them on their way.The Russian embassy in London is perhaps the most ruthless when it comes to the weaponising of memes. Not only does it mock the British government with gags about how frosty relations are, but it also has a “diplomatic club” – a fan club of sorts whose members are asked to retweet the account’s posts. In return, they can win prizes and potential receptions at the embassy. Essentially, the embassy uses fans to promote its cheap jokes so they reach a wider audience.These tweets are obviously silly, but does that mean they shouldn’t be taken seriously? Are they just outbursts from low-level government employees blowing off steam - or do we have to see them as serious public statements?These are questions the US has had to grapple with every time Donald Trump picks up his phone, and some have argued that it’s better to ignore the president’s tweets and focus on his actions. But Constance Duncombe, a lecturer in international relations at Monash University who has written papers on the role of social media in modern diplomacy, says we can’t ignore what happens online.“We should take Twitter outbursts seriously, either as considered diplomatic signalling or as a personal response to feeling the image of one’s state has been tarnished or undermined,” she says. “Diplomacy is not always about maintaining a polite demeanour, and diplomats will deploy subtle insults or snubs to bolster their national image or to manage the behaviour of their counterparts.”What’s changed, she argues, is how public these outbursts have become. Settling scores in an accessible, cultural language, viewable to all, sends a clear message that might otherwise be difficult to project. “Using pop culture images, memes and gifs frames insults through humour or sarcasm, making the diplomat or state leader’s views instantly accessible and allowing its meaning to travel beyond the immediate interpersonal or institutional interaction.”Not everyone is a natural at such exchanges. After Trump repeatedly tweeted about how awful the Paris climate accord was and even suggested the cold east coast could “use a little global warming”, the president of the European council, Donald Tusk, couldn’t quite match his bombast.Perhaps Tusk should be applauded for maintaining a semblance of political demeanour. Or perhaps the only way to win in this new world is to fight fire with fire and he should have repurposed another Mean Girls quote: “The world is getting hot. It might even be hotter than Regina George.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eac3d4c5e74217b4a0b1330accedfb6a6d3bf845/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3e0d3e98a2921869b773a8debc7b4804","title":"50 great tracks for june christine queens playboi carti the 1975","story":"From Troye Sivan’s ode to bottoming to Oneohtrix Point Never’s joyous electronic cheese, here are 50 tracks you shouldn’t be without this month – subscribe to the whole playlist and read about 10 of the bestby  Ben Beaumont-Thomas and  Laura SnapesOr rather, Chris and the Queens. In her accompanying notes on Genius, the returning French pop star explains how this song sees her take on a macho persona as a way of sparring with male sexual energy – even if there are those who will reject her for it. Also done in French as sister recording Damn, Dis-Moi, Girlfriend is set to HD 80s boogie production – redolent of the guest star Dam-Funk, who delivers some deep, sexy vocal interjections.In a very strong month for rap albums, what with A$AP Rocky’s impressionistically blunted Testing and Pusha T’s Kanye-produced side of beef Daytona both proving excellent, Playboi Carti’s newest full-length, Die Lit, still stood out. His hopscotching flow broke through on Magnolia last year, and that track’s producer, Pi’erre Bourne, is the key to the album’s hazy appeal. For Fell In Luv, he cuts up a sample of a sample – Purity Ring’s lift of Young Magic – to end up with something Holly Herndon might make if she segued into mumble-rap production.Recent months have seen the 1975’s frontman Matty Healy credited with inspiring a spuriously named genre called Healywave (though he prefers Mattycore). To be fair, he has worked with most of the acts connected with it – his Dirty Hit labelmates Pale Waves and No Rome – and to be even fairer, it should probably be called Hutchencewave for its clear debt to INXS. Still, technicalities: no sooner had the term started catching on (sort of) than the 1975 return with a completely new sound. The first track from their third album hooks around a single, strangulated riff that sounds a bit like Room on Fire-era Strokes rendered as a polyphonic ringtone. It’s miles better than that suggests, and completely unlike anything else on the radio. Like always, Healy’s lyrics veer between ludicrous and devoutly sincere, touching on STDs, finding grey hairs in your “zoot” (zoot!) and an impressively self-lacerating description of himself as “a millennial that baby boomers like”. As neurotic as the song is, Healy suggests being kinder to yourself as you grow up the strangely affecting Give Yourself a Try is a sign of the 1975 letting themselves grow in weird and wonderful ways.Speaking of Healywave, there’s definitely a touch of the 1975 in the muted guitar that chimes through the second chorus of Troye Sivan’s excellent single Bloom. But most of this glorious ode to bottoming shimmers by on synths that channel the sense of anticipation and nervousness that Sivan conveys as he plays the part of a receptive partner losing his virginity. It’s stylishly done stuff: his voice on the tantalising first verse is coated in whispery reverb, an invitation to come closer, while the choruses are peppered with subtle gasps that imbue the elegant Bloom with an indecently good sense of lust.It seems far too long since Tirzah’s brief run of brilliance in the mid-2010s – not least the brilliantly scruffy I’m Not Dancing. Similarly earwormy is Gladly, the first single from her long-awaited debut album Devotion (out this August on Domino). Produced by Mica Levi, the track lopes sleepily around a single loop, a heavy, warped piano refrain that seems to pace around in circles and mirrors Tirzah’s state of mind. “All I want is you,” she repeats, drowsy with longing and obsession: “I love you.” Proof that the simplest songs are sometimes the most profound.It’s been a banner month for the Tottenham MC. Not only has he guested on standout tracks on the aforementioned Playboi Carti and A$AP Rocky albums – appearing on stage with the latter and a giant crash test dummy head in London – he has also released one of his strongest solo tracks ever. Over a minimalist beat that perfectly encapsulates the way he currently straddles grime and US rap, Pure Water sees him announce his own greatness with armour-plated self-confidence.Thirty-four years ago, Prophet self-released 1,000 copies of Right on Time, an album of scuffed, wonky but compelling electro-funk that disappeared without trace. But it was coveted by Stones Throw label head Peanut Butter Wolf, who met with Prophet and got him in the studio to finally do the follow-up. Tonight is a rerecorded version of a track from his debut, which was covered by Nite Jewel in 2011, who turns up here to join in the homecoming: a magnificent, stumbling funk jam. Nite Jewel – one of the most underrated songwriters around today – has her own track on the playlist too, On Your Own, a Hi-NRG synth workout topped with a soaring vocal.The Brooklyn garage rockers keep knocking out classic after classic, with new LP Wide Awake! another essential collection of varied, literate, totally satisfying jams. One highlight, Freebird II – the title typical of their droll hipster humour – features a big, satisfying organ melody matched by a blokey singalong for the chorus. Andrew Savage’s verses are like a positivist spin on those from Human Performance, the title lament from the band’s last album.Miss Red was born in Israel to Moroccan-Polish parents but, with her girlish patois, she sounds more like she was brought up in a Kingston ghetto. Pairing her once more with producer the Bug, who she accosted at a Tel Aviv rave and went on to tour and record with, Dagga is the first track from her debut album. One of the Bug’s hallmark industrial-dancehall riddims rides under Miss Red’s coquettish singsong vocals.Fresh from a brilliant score for the Robert Pattison thriller Good Time, and following a string of albums of densely splintered electronics, Daniel Lopatin has released an ambitious new record in Age Of. It finds space for drunken harpsichords, Anohni, terrifying shouting, tender Bon Iver-style digital songcraft, harsh trap and jazzy synth solos, and yet hangs together: he is the great sonic essayist of our voracious, always-on culture. The highlight is the symphonic Toys 2, his biggest, cheesiest moment yet, and his most moving."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/99ee359003f32080428f113ba91f99c13fdc032c/327_681_3150_1890/master/3150.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b5447df77ea4a69950275e4e69026a19","title":"arron banks russia brexit meeting","story":"Documents seen by Observer suggest multiple meetings between 2015 and 2017Arron Banks, the millionaire businessman who bankrolled Nigel Farage’s campaign to quit the EU, had multiple meetings with Russian embassy officials in the run-up to the Brexit referendum, documents seen by the Observer suggest.Banks, who gave £12m of services to the campaign, becoming the biggest donor in UK history, has repeatedly denied any involvement with Russian officials, or that Russian money played any part in the Brexit campaign. The Observer has seen documents which a senior Tory MP says, if correct, raise urgent and troubling questions about his relationship with the Russian government.• Multiple meetings between the leaders of Leave.EU and high-ranking Russian officials, from November 2015 to 2017.• Two meetings in the week Leave.EU launched its official campaign.• An introduction to a Russian businessman, by the Russian ambassador, the day after Leave.EU launched its campaign, who reportedly offered Banks a multibillion dollar opportunity to buy Russian goldmines.• A trip to Moscow in February 2016 to meet key partners and financiers behind a gold project, including a Russian bank.• Continued extensive contact in the run-up to the US election when Banks, his business partner and Leave.EU spokesman Andy Wigmore, and Nigel Farage campaigned in the US to support Donald Trump’s candidacy.Banks and Wigmore – who was also present at many of the meetings – were due to appear before the select committee for the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport on Tuesday to answer questions about Leave.EU’s role in the European referendum.Hours after the Observer contacted them for comment on Friday, they published a letter stating they would not attend the hearing, and accused the committee of colluding with a pro-Remain campaign group.But on Saturday Banks suggested that he would attend after all, and accused the Tory chairman, Damian Collins, of colluding with journalists.Controversy has grown over Russia’s alleged interference in a series of key polls, including the election of Donald Trump, last year’s French presidential elections and the Brexit referendum, to secure outcomes favourable to President Putin. Putin has long seen the eastward expansion of EU influence as a threat.Towards the end of last year, Banks issued a statement saying his contacts with “the Russians” consisted of “one boozy lunch” at the Russian embassy. Documents seen by the Observer, suggest a different version of events.From November 2015, the ambassador, Alexander Yakovenko, courted Banks and Wigmore, inviting them to multiple events and meetings in the run-up to the European referendum, many of which, the documents suggest, they attended.On 16 November, the documents suggest, Yakovenko invited them to an evening meeting at the Russian embassy. It is not clear if they attended but the next day, 17 November, Leave.EU held its launch event – with Brittany Kaiser of Cambridge Analytica. And on 18 November, Banks and Wigmore again visited the embassy. On this occasion, the Russian ambassador introduced them to a Russian businessman with extensive business interests in Russian goldmines, according to documents seen by the Observer.It is understood they were presented with a business opportunity in which they were offered a chance to invest in a plan to buy six Russian gold firms and merge them into a single entity, potentially netting a profit of several billion dollars.Documents seen by the Observer suggest further meetings and discussions took place between the businessman and Banks and Wigmore, including a trip to Moscow in February 2016 during which Banks was scheduled to meet high-level officials from the state-owned bank.The deal to buy the goldmines with funding from the bank was announced on 5 July 2016, 12 days after the referendum. It is not clear if Banks invested, although he tweeted on 17 July 2016 : “I am buying gold at the moment \u0026amp big mining stocks.” There is no public record of Banks being an investor in it.According to the documents seen by the Observer, the hospitality extended both ways with Banks and Wigmore inviting the ambassador and a senior Russian diplomat to attend an evening with business contacts in a pub, and even to watch the results of the referendum at Leave.EU headquarters in Millbank, although the ambassador said he had to decline because of commitments in Moscow.The invitations continued after the referendum during the time in which Banks, Wigmore and Farage began travelling regularly to America to support Donald Trump’s bid for the presidency, according to the documents.Ambassador Yakovenko met Wigmore and Banks on 19 August, the day Steve Bannon became Trump’s campaign manager. It was days before they travelled to Mississippi with Nigel Farage for a rally on 25 August at which Donald Trump introduced him to the crowds as “Mr Brexit”. He said a Trump presidency would be “Brexit plus”.Wigmore declined to comment on any of the allegations the Observer put to him. The Observer submitted questions to Banks on Friday morning. He said initially he needed more time “to check his diary and office computer”. He repeatedly refused to comment, though last night he reportedly downplayed the significance of the meetings and denied that Russian officials sought to influence his Leave.EU referendum campaign.The Russian Embassy told the Observer: “The Russian Embassy has not in any way intervened in domestic UK political process, including the Brexit referendum. Meeting stakeholders representing all political spectrum of the host country is a natural element of the work of any embassy.”Collins, the chair of the select committee for the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, said: “Russia is not our friend. And this new material raises questions of the most serious nature. If deals were brokered with Russian government help, it would raise urgent questions about Russian interference in our democracy. We urgently need Arron Banks to answer these and other questions. People will wonder if this is the real reason he has cancelled his appearance before the committee.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/294dcc0ee8fb2cbe8192fb725d349415a9631b37/0_42_4032_2420/master/4032.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6e666f37cd391ac9d9fbbf190d442a61","title":"stop boris theresa may mps backing crucial votes brexit","story":"Rebel Tory MPs who want to keep the UK in the EU customs union and single market appeared on Saturday to be backing away from defeating Theresa May in crucial parliamentary votes this week – because they fear the resulting humiliation could threaten her leadership and let in Boris Johnson.Before a momentous week in the Commons, several votes – including on the customs union and the role of parliament in the Brexit “endgame” – remain on a knife edge. Labour, the SNP and Liberal Democrats need only a dozen or so Tories to join them to inflict humiliation on May, and throw her Brexit strategy into chaos.But on Saturday there were signs that May and her whips had reduced the threat level from critical to severe, as key Tory rebels said they feared that striking now could trigger a full-blown leadership crisis that would destabilise the entire party and pave the way for a hardline Brexiter such as Johnson to mount a challenge.While some Tory rebels, including Anna Soubry and Kenneth Clarke, are among those who are still likely to vote against their own party on the customs union and other amendments, others, including former education secretary Nicky Morgan, are understood to have doubts that this week is the time to strike.While they are still determined to secure changes to ensure Britain stays in the customs union and close to the single market, they now believe the time to do so is later in the summer when the trade and customs bills return to the Commons. May also appears to have won important support from her former home secretary, the ardent Remainer Amber Rudd, who is expected to call on Tory MPs in a newspaper article on Sunday to back the prime minister and give her support before a vital EU summit later this month.Tensions over Brexit reached new heights last week ahead of the Commons showdowns. First, the Brexit secretary, David Davis, threatened to resign over government plans for post-Brexit customs arrangements that he saw as paving the way for long-term involvement in the EU economic model. Then it was revealed that Johnson, the foreign secretary, had been secretly taped telling Tory donors that Brexit negotiations were heading for “meltdown” and that US President Donald Trump would have handled them better.Tory Remainers say they have been reassured that May is now moving towards a softer form of Brexit, including the possibility of a long-term customs arrangement with the EU to solve the problem of Northern Ireland.They fear any change at the top could let in a hard Brexiter as new leader, probably Johnson or the environment secretary Michael Gove, who would prefer the hardest exit or no deal at all to secure a clean break from Brussels.While May is heading for a tense two days of votes on Tuesday and Wednesday, Jeremy Corbyn is also facing a rebellion by his own Remain-inclined MPs, after they were ordered by party whips to abstain in a vote on staying in the European Economic Area (EEA) – a move that would allow the UK to stay in the single market. Several dozen Labour MPs, including several senior figures, are expected to defy the party whip and support the Lords amendment.Hilary Benn, Labour chair of the Brexit select committee, is among them. He told the Observer: “We should keep our options open and that’s what the EEA amendment does. It would solve the Northern Ireland problem, keep goods flowing freely, ensure common standards, protect employment and environmental rights, and enable us to continue to co-operate in important areas like aviation, consumer safety and medicines. And it’s an option that the Brexit select committee has said could be an alternative.”Labour is also being warned that the cost to the economy of its current policy – of staying in the customs union but not single market – would be £29bn by 2030, according to a study by Cambridge Econometrics. It also suggests that such a Brexit would cost 300,000 jobs, compared to staying in both.The Open Britain campaign group says the analysis implies there would be a £1.1bn loss to the north-east economy, a £3bn hit to the north-west and a £6.3bn reduction in London. Labour currently refuses to back EEA membership for a number of reasons, including that it would mean obeying EU freedom of movement rules and would not allow membership of the customs union, therefore preventing a solution to the Northern Ireland border issue.Meanwhile, pro-Brexit Tories are preparing to turn up the heat on May over coming weeks, demanding a major change of course amid cabinet concerns that her current strategy will end in electoral “disaster” for the party.There is now widespread frustration among Brexiters, who believe the Brexit they sought is disappearing from view. They have now drawn up plans to “rescue the process” once the withdrawal bill passes it last major hurdle this week. Major changes in strategy are being demanded by both Davis and Johnson.One ally of the foreign secretary said: “From the very start, Theresa and Philip Hammond have treated this as making the best of a bad job. On the Brexit side, the key is getting the withdrawal bill through with as few concessions as possible. Once you’ve guaranteed you’re leaving, even if not on the best terms, at least we’re leaving. There is then a thinking that there is time to rescue the process.“A change at the top is one of the options. Once the withdrawal bill goes through, that will leave her more vulnerable. My instinct is there won’t be any challenge this side of March next year. But if something happens, that could quickly change.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ceff5a5c3fdcc68f63a67b220b2dac24d35a0a41/0_0_1617_970/master/1617.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=293705834da4be1f57148a6c37fc6fcb","title":"may versus parliament showdown brexit","story":"When Theresa May boarded an RAF Voyager plane at Heathrow last Thursday afternoon and headed for a two-day G7 summit in Quebec, she must have been hoping for at least a little respite from arguments with her cabinet over Brexit. She had, in any case, to use some time in the air to prepare for what promised to be a difficult meeting with fellow world leaders, in a number of respects.President Trump had reportedly been referring disparagingly to May’s “schoolmarm” style and political correctness in the run-up to the meeting. More serious arguments were also looming with the president, the most pressing being over his decision to impose steel tariffs on the US’s European and other allies, risking a trade war.But Brexit still stalked her all the way across the Atlantic. First there was the wash-up from a heated row with her Brexit secretary, David Davis, whom she had to talk out of resigning over a “backstop” deal on customs before she headed to Heathrow. That dominated a press briefing mid-flight. Then, as the plane was taxiing into the airport terminal at Bagotville airbase, near Quebec, news reached the UK contingent that the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, had exploded another bomb under cabinet collective responsibility. Johnson had been secretly taped telling a private meeting that, under May’s leadership, Brexit negotiations were heading for “meltdown”. Trump, he said, would do a much better job.Journalists demanded an immediate response from the PM, who had heard nothing of Johnson’s outburst while in the air. Would she sack him? Did she still have full confidence in her foreign secretary? The questions were thrown at the prime minister’s aides as she switched planes onto a Canadian Air Force Hercules and headed to the summit at the Manoir Richelieu resort, leaving the press on the tarmac.As MPs prepare to vote in the Commons this week on crucial Brexit amendments passed in the House of Lords, and as an EU summit approaches that is supposed to agree a post-Brexit customs plans to solve the Irish border problem, any pretence of government unity has been abandoned. The two sides of the Tory Brexit war argue openly, whether they are rivals in cabinet or on the backbenches. It was not only Davis who was threatening to resign on Thursday but several other Brexit-supporting ministers too, among them Davis’s deputy Steve Baker. They – like Johnson – were furious that May’s latest customs plan did not put a time limit on the “backstop” proposal for keeping the UK aligned to the EU customs union if it fails to reach a deal.That omission looked to Brexiters like a ploy to tie the UK permanently into parts of the EU economic system, and a victory for Tory Remainers. May had invited Remain supporters including Anna Soubry and Ken Clarke into Downing Street earlier in the week to brief them on the backstop plan (with no end date). Unsurprisingly, they loved it. Davis’s reaction, equally inevitably, was precisely the reverse. He demanded to see May on Thursday morning and told her in no uncertain terms in two private meetings that she had to include an end date, or it would look like Brexit was never going to happen.“It was the most frank discussion they have ever had,” said a Davis ally. “They have not talked like that before. He made it clear that he had to be listened to if he was to carry on as Brexit secretary.” The PM and Davis then agreed a fudge that said the government “expects” the backstop to conclude at the end of 2021. As one middle-ranking minister put it that day: “All the PM’s energy goes on trying to keep the peace. She tells one side what it wants to hear, then reassures the other side. So we go nowhere.”The disputes run wider, into the heart of the Westminster machine, preventing the joined-up government that is essential in negotiations as complex as those about Brexit. Business leaders who meet ministers in Downing Street say they are listened to politely but never get clarity. Davis is said to see the hand of Olly Robbins, May’s chief Brexit adviser at No 10, behind a drift towards soft-Brexit thinking in Downing Street. Robbins was moved from Davis’s department last year, where he was permanent secretary, as the two never got on. The PM now leans on Robbins increasingly. The trouble for her is that there is increasing speculation in Whitehall that Robbins has had enough and is plotting a move to the private sector by the autumn. While this is denied by No 10, such gossip in high places does not inspire confidence that all is well.The big question now, with the executive in turmoil, is whether parliament will begin to take control – whether a legislature with a large Remain majority will start to seize the initiative in the Brexit process this week.On Tuesday and Wednesday, MPs will debate and vote on a string of amendments passed in the Lords, several of which would wreak havoc with May’s Brexit strategy and further damage her authority if passed in the Commons. They range from one which calls for the government to take steps to negotiate to stay in the customs union, to another which urges it to work towards membership of the European Economic Area (EEA), which would allow the UK to remain in the single market after Brexit.True Remainers want both outcomes, but on the Tory side there is much agonising about how best to get there and whether this week is the moment to strike. Both Tory and Labour MPs who oppose hard Brexit are furious that Jeremy Corbyn has decided to order his MPs to abstain rather than back the EEA amendment, when there were, possibly, enough Tory rebels to support it had Labour piled in.Hilary Benn, who is one of dozens of Labour MPs who will defy his own leader and vote for the EEA amendment, as well as for the customs unions plan (which Labour does support), says this is the moment.“It’s a chance for parliament to take control amid the evident chaos inside the cabinet, which is worrying business and undermining future investment in jobs and prosperity. If government can’t lead, then parliament must,” Benn says.On the customs union, pro-EU Tory rebels seem ided this weekend. Clarke and Soubry are likely to stand firm and rebel – voting against the government in favour of the customs union plan – and it is not impossible that enough others may join them for it to be passed. But at least 12 Tories would need to defy their own government, and the “rebel dozen” are split on tactics. If any fall by the wayside, the chance of defeating the government is gone.Some wonder whether defeating May now, when she is moving in their direction on wider Brexit thinking, might be self-defeating, as it would unleash leadership threats from the Brexiter hardliners just when Remainers had got May where they wanted her.There is also, on Tuesday, a vote on a potentially far-reaching amendment concerning what would happen if – and after – the government were to be defeated in a “meaningful vote” on the final deal Theresa May brings back from Brussels this autumn.This Lords amendment says parliament should then take control and instruct the executive through parliamentary motions how to proceed in further negotiations with Brussels. The government, seeing the huge constitutional significance of this, has put down its own counter-amendment to try to neuter its effect, saying that ministers would merely report back within 28 days.Benn says this is the most important vote of all in the coming week – one that could “ensure that parliament gets to decide what should happen when we come to the end of the negotiations”.After decades in which Eurosceptics have demanded curbs on the power of Brussels and a return to parliamentary sovereignty, this could, potentially, be a moment of supreme political irony – the moment when Remain MPs, if they muster the numbers, make that sovereignty a reality in order to stymie the ambitions of the Brexiters.Customs unionThis would prevent the European Communities Act being repealed until the government had spelled out steps it has taken to negotiate UK participation in a customs union. The Tories will oppose it, but Labour will vote for it, as will the SNP and Lib Dems. Around a dozen Tories would need to rebel for it to be passed. Anna Soubry and Ken Clarke are likely to rebel but may hold fire and vote for a stronger customs union amendment on the trade or customs bills in July.European Economic AreaThe amendment would force the government to make remaining in the EEA, and therefore in the single market, a negotiating objective. While there are more than a dozen Tory MPs who would have defied their government and voted for it, Labour has decided not to whip in favour. As a result it is unlikely to pass. But there could still be big Tory and Labour rebellions, showing strength of feeling in both parties for staying in the single market.Meaningful voteThis says parliament must approve the withdrawal agreement. But it also says that if the deal the PM brings back from Brussels is rejected by MPs, parliament should effectively take control. The Tories have tabled a counter-amendment to try to neuter it, but the other parties will back it. There may be enough Tory rebels for this to be passed, but not definitely.Environmental protectionsAfter fears that EU environmental protections would be seriously weakened after Brexit, the Lords passed an amendment ensuring they would stay in place. With a few tweaks from former cabinet minister Oliver Letwin, the principle of keeping protections in place looks set to be accepted by the government. But campaigners are concerned that the amendment does not go far enough to ensure a green Brexit."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/913ade4e312ca40858ba27b0cc713faff8a596ff/0_145_3058_1835/master/3058.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5ac32380fdab0c339371ad98bd2d6538","title":"3000 year old sculpture leaves researchers scratching their heads","story":"Exquisite Old Testament-era head of a king found in Israel but subject’s identity a mystery An enigmatic sculpture of a king’s head dating back nearly 3,000 years has left researchers guessing at whose face it depicts.The 5cm (two-inch) sculpture is an exceedingly rare example of figurative art from the region during the fourth century BC – a period associated with biblical kings. It is exquisitely preserved but for a bit of missing beard, and nothing quite like it has been found before.While scholars are certain the stern-bearded figure wearing a golden crown represents royalty, they are less sure which king it symbolises, or which kingdom he may have ruled.Archaeologists unearthed the figurine in 2017 during excavations at a site called Abel Beth Maacah, located just south of Israel’s border with Lebanon, near the modern-day town of Metula.Nineteenth-century archaeologists identified the site, then home to a village called Abil al-Qamh, with the similarly named city mentioned in the Old Testament’s Book of Kings.During the ninth century BC, the ancient town was situated in a liminal zone between three regional powers: the Aramean kingdom based in Damascus to the east, the Phoenician city of Tyre to the west and the Israelite kingdom, with its capital in Samaria to the south.Kings 1 15:20 mentions Abel Beth Maacah in a list of cities attacked by the Aramean king Ben Hadad in a campaign against the Israelite kingdom.“This location is very important because it suggests that the site may have shifted hands between these polities, more likely between Aram-Damascus and Israel,” said Hebrew University archaeologist Naama Yahalom-Mack, who has headed the joint dig with California’s Azusa Pacific University since 2013.Yahalom-Mack’s team was digging through the floor of a massive iron age structure in the summer of 2017 when a volunteer struck pay dirt. The layer where the head was found dates to the the epoch associated with the rival biblical kingdoms of Israel and Judah.In a rare move, archaeologists and curators at the Israel Museum in Jerusalem rushed to put the piece on public display. A detailed report is set for publication in the June edition of the journal Near Eastern Archaeology.Eran Arie, Israel Museum’s curator of iron age and Persian archaeology, said the discovery was one of a kind. “In the iron age, if there’s any figurative art, and there largely isn’t, it’s of very low quality. And this is of exquisite quality.”The royal figurine is made of faience, a glass-like material that was popular in jewellery and small human and animal figurines in ancient Egypt and the Near East.“The colour of the face is greenish because of this copper tint that we have in the silicate paste,” Yahalom-Mack said. But a crucial clue for identifying it as a Near Eastern monarch was its “very interesting hairdo”, she said, which looks similar to the way ancient Egyptians depicted neighbouring Near Eastern peoples in art.“The guy kind of represents the generic way Semitic people are described,” she said.Because carbon-14 dating cannot give a more exact date for the statue’s creation other than some time in the ninth century, the field of potential candidates is large. Yahalom-Mack posited it could be kings Ben Hadad or Hazael of Damascus, Ahab or Jehu of Israel, or Ithobaal of Tyre – all characters appearing in the biblical narrative.“We’re only guessing here, it’s like a game,” she said. “It’s like a hello from the past, but we don’t know anything else about it.”As scholars debate whether the head was a standalone piece or part of a larger statue, the Hebrew University team is set to restart digging this month at the spot where the mystery king’s head was found."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2278c8075fd4322cfc8e2805a3e9d43eee8ce608/1607_1339_4009_2405/master/4009.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7999b8a2a8ad90c90b442403114ac32f","title":"devon log bank fuel poverty roresters food banks","story":"Foresters cooperative forging links with food banks and charities to reach those in needA band of volunteer foresters working from a base tucked away in a steep West Country valley is pioneering a “log bank” scheme designed to help struggling families and iniduals out of fuel poverty. Inspired by the food bank system that has become a feature of austerity Britain, the idea is that people in Devon who are unable to afford to heat their homes will be supplied with free logs for open fires and burners.  For the last eight years members of the Axewoods Co-operative – the name is a play on the River Axe as well as the cutting tool – have managed woodland in east Devon without pay in exchange for the firewood produced as they work. The scheme has been so successful that they found they were getting more wood than they were able to use themselves and decided to launch the log bank. East Devon district council has provided the group with a plot of land at its Knapp Copse nature reserve to season the wood and store equipment. Axewoods is now forging links with food banks, charities and advice centres to find people who would benefit from a supply of logs.  Its chairman, Alan Dyer, said members hoped their scheme, which they believe to be the first of its kind, could help hundreds of people heat and power their homes.“It’s not aimed at people who might turn up in their Range Rover, load up and say: ‘Thanks very much for the free logs,’” Dyer said. “Fuel poverty is a real problem in rural areas. In the south-west where wages are low and costs are high ordinary people are struggling to keep themselves warm. If they have access to a log burner or open fire, the wood we provide could make all the difference.” Fuel poverty is defined as a household living on a low income in a home that cannot be kept warm at reasonable cost without bringing residual income below the poverty threshold. Axewoods is very much a product of austerity Britain. Ten years ago it became clear that many landowners, both private and public sector, were not prepared to spend money on managing woodland because bringing in commercial contractors was so expensive.  In east Devon people with an interest in sylvan areas and forestry work formed the cooperative and offered to manage woodlands in exchange for logs for their own use. “The landowners have their woods managed and we get exercise and free wood,” said Dyer. “We have retired people, youngsters, unemployed, business people, coastguards come along. It’s an eclectic mix, which is half the fun.”  A new member flagged up that he had come across people burning rubbish in stoves – and often damaging them – because they could not afford good quality wood. The cooperative decided to try to find a way of getting its surfeit of logs to such people. The environment secretary Michael Gove’s calls for curbs on wood burners and coal fires to reduce emissions are dismissed by Dyer as a “stupid soundbite”. He agreed people burning logs could be a problem in London, but not in the places such as Devon. Nathan Robinson, a local authority nature reserves ranger who works with the cooperative, said: “In many rural areas of the district, wood fuel provides one of only a few viable options for how to heat your home. A project such as this which aims to supply firewood from sustainably managed sources to those in need is surely a good thing. It’s a win-win as I see it. Warm homes, well managed woods.”Claire Wright, the Devon county councillor for Otter Valley, called the log bank a fantastic project. She said: “Some people genuinely do have to make a choice between eating and heating their house. I know not everyone has a log burner or open fire but for those who do then this service could be a bit of a lifeline.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f501e818e4f5b0994884a8f6e27ebdcd2aab9b67/0_130_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9d2d1dc746f0372e56ac81dda5515309","title":"england south africa","story":"When the Premiership clubs raise the issue of Eddie Jones’s national squad training sessions this summer, bristling at a high attrition rate, Twickenham should show a video of England’s latest defeat against a nascent South Africa side who were able to recover from an appalling start because of an ability, honed in Super Rugby, to play at sustained pace.It was a Premiership player, the Sale scrum-half Faf de Klerk, who was his side’s catalyst, but the difference was at forward, where the Springboks retained their shape in the loose when a crazy game was at its most frenetic. England took an early 24-3 lead through the passing ability of George Ford that exploited a narrow, naive defence, but once the home side got hold of the ball, the failings that addled this year’s Six Nations campaign surfaced.Jones had picked a side to play a fast game, sacrificing scrummaging and lineout options, which he reduced further after 35 minutes when he took off a second-row, Nick Isiekwe, and brought on a back‑rower, Brad Shields, who had only been with the squad for a week, in an attempt to plug the breakdown and constrict De Klerk by slowing down South Africa’s possession.His decision to pull Luther Burrell early in the opening Test in Australia two years ago after a slow start worked but Shields had little impact. He was better equipped than his team-mates to deal with the relentless pace of the game, having played Super Rugby for four months, but alone he could not recalibrate the team’s disorientation.International rugby has changed in the past 18 months, as has the game in the European Champions Cup. It is more fluid, faster and places less reliance on set pieces. Jones’s training sessions are regarded as brutal not because he has players smashing into each other, although a judo session in Brighton yielded a few casualties. Everything is done at pace and when players are blowing he does not allow them respite, pushing them to the limits of their endurance and beyond.He has to because the Premiership does not condition players for Test rugby. It has developed considerably as a tournament in its 20 years in terms of facilities and the interest it attracts from spectators and sponsors but it is self-contained in a way the Pro 14 and Super Rugby are not. Those who declaim Jones’s methods tend to be club owners rather than coaches, interested in the bottom line, but this season’s Champions Cup should have shown them how the game is moving.Instead of seeking conflict with England and trying to get Jones to change his training methods, which will not happen, they should be aligning their clubs with the national side, as South Africa have done with their Super Rugby franchises. Just as England lost a game they should have won in Johannesburg, so the Premiership clubs had the playing resources to have made a far greater impact on Europe last season.The elite player agreement between the RFU and the clubs has worked to a point but its value to owners tends to be financial. It is a partnership only in the loose sense of the word and the professional game as a whole should reflect on Saturday’s defeat\u0026nbsp– only once before had a tier-one nation recovered from a deficit greater than 21 points to win, Wales in Argentina in 1999 – and devise a way of moving forward together.It was only last year that Jones was talking about England overhauling New Zealand at the top of the rankings before the start of next year’s World Cup. Two more defeats in South Africa could see them slip to fifth, with the All Blacks arriving at Twickenham in November.Jones has to look at selection, with Mike Brown playing like a full-back and Elliot Daly an outside back, but the different way matches are refereed in the Premiership and at Test level leaves much of his influence on the training field where, alone, only so much can be achieved."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2724fc31beeecad793b1c7e01d765ca1109fe8d0/0_27_4410_2646/master/4410.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5204278a20b22e55c2192a6ca0b9067a","title":"rafael nadal v dominic thiem french open 2018 mens final live","story":"Rafa Nadal has made it this far after beating Simone Bolelli, Guido Pella, Richard Gasquet, Max Marterer, Diego Schwartzman and Juan Martin Del Potro.Dominic Thiem has made it this far after beating Ilya Ivashka, Stefanos Tsitsipas, Matteo Berrettini, Kei Nishikori, Alexander Zverev and Marco Cecchinato.Hello. It’s getting to the point where Rafael Nadal’s dominance of the French Open is going to have to feature in guidebooks to Paris. Forget about going up the Eiffel Tower, taking a boat down the Seine, walking along the Champs-Elysées, queuing for Notre-Dame and looking out over the city from Montmartre – if you really want to understand Parisian life, take a trip to Roland Garros to witness one of sport’s most crushing inevitabilities: Nadal grinding some poor guy into the Parisian clay.He brings an imposing 85-2 record into this afternoon’s final and, if there is to be an upset, then Austria’s Dominic Thiem must produce the performance of his life. That’s not entirely unthinkable given that the seventh-seeded 24-year-old has beaten Nadal twice on clay in the past two years, most recently when they met in the quarter-finals in Madrid last month, and can take encouragement from the fact that the Spaniard has wobbled a little in the past fortnight. Yet history suggests that the chances of Nadal losing this one are slimmer than them running out of baguettes in Paris. Only two men have beaten Nadal at the French Open – Robin Soderling in 2009 and Novak Djokovic in 2015 (a wrist injury also got the better of him in 2016) – and the 32-year-old is searching for his 11th title after ending his quest for La Decima last year. It’s hard to see him being denied. Thiem might be the world’s second best player on clay but this is his debut in a grand slam final and he’s up against a player who has a 16-7 winning record in these marquee occasions. The facts are cold and unforgiving.Of course, Thiem shouldn’t be too pessimistic. Otherwise there’d be no point in him even turning up. He has the weapons, power and swagger to cause problems and he’ll surely have noted that it hasn’t all been plain sailing for Nadal at this tournament. Simone Bolelli inconvenienced him in the first round, Diego Schwartzman led by a set and a break before rain interrupted in the quarters and Nadal he had to save six break points in his semi-final against Juan Martin del Potro. But Nadal, who destroyed Thiem in the semis last year, is so remorseless here. This is his kingdom. Court Philippe-Chatrier is his palace. He’ll expect to reign supreme once more.Play begins at: 2pm BST, 3pm in Paris."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ced9c6a687a76471b2c42cd96f4f8dc41637719/133_60_4026_2416/master/4026.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4d6b76e738b56959f9ef276a7dac1630","title":"scotland v england odi live","story":"38th over: Scotland 250-3 (MacLeod 70, Munsey 31) As Mike Atherton says on Sky, Rashid’s last three overs are key here. If Scotland get after him, England could be in serious trouble. “Where’s Buttler?” asks Robin Bextor. He’s been rested for this game. 37th over: Scotland 245-3 (MacLeod 67, Munsey 28) Another reverse sweep for four from Munsey, and Moeen ends with figures of 10-0-66-0. England look resigned to chasing in excess of 350+. 36th over: Scotland 237-3 (MacLeod 66, Munsey 22) Mark Wood is back, and the extra pace allows MacLeod to ping a cut to the fence. Munsey helps another boundary to fine leg. England are being smashed all round the park!35th over: Scotland 227-3 (MacLeod 61, Munsey 17) A good over from Moeen two from it. Scotland need 115 from the last 15 overs to make their highest ever ODI score.34th over: Scotland 225-3 (MacLeod 60, Munsey 16) Oof. Munsey thumps Plunkett contemptuously over mid-off for a one-bounce four. England are in a bit of trouble here. The pitch and the short boundaries are in their favour, and in that sense even 350 should not worry them. But the mind can do funny things when defeat is unthinkable.33rd over: Scotland 218-3 (MacLeod 59, Munsey 11) For the second time in as many overs, Munsey reverse sweeps Moeen over backward point for four. This is now Scotland’s highest score against England. Is something brilliant happening?32nd over: Scotland 211-3 (MacLeod 57, Munsey 6) MacLeod gets up on his toes to back cut Plunkett for four, another extremely good stroke. “Rob,” says John Starbuck. “Going round the Grange’ is a snappy phrase, and one you should keep in reserve for future cases of a bowler’s efforts being smashed about.” But what would they mean for our old favourite, ‘haemmorhaging runs’?31st over: Scotland 205-3 (MacLeod 52, Munsey 5) The new batsman is the left-handed George Munsey, and \u0026ltkidstoday\u0026gt he gets off the mark with a jaunty reverse sweep for four \u0026ltkidstoday\u0026gt.“They say when you’ve got wickets in hand you should double your score at 30 overs,” says Habit Butt. “We’re midway through the 30th over and Scotland are 200 with wickets in hand so they are on course for 400 plus. England’s world record is at risk isn’t it?”I wouldn’t go that far, but they could get 350.30th over: Scotland 200-2 (MacLeod 52, Munsey 0) “The question about the England batsman with three 150+ scores in ODIs - is the answer something brilliant like Ronnie Irani?” says Eamonn Maloney. “If not, can you devise a question (perhaps using some sort of Jeopardy-style reverse function on statsguru) to which the answer is, brilliantly, Ronnie Irani?”Sadly, I already know the question: when England left Robin Smith out of the Test team for the final time in 1996, who replaced him?Plunkett returns to the attack and takes his second wicket. Berrington drove high towards long off, where Root took a calm running catch.29th over: Scotland 196-2 (MacLeod 53, Berrington 34) MacLeod dances down to chip Moeen over midwicket for a one-bounce four – and then brings up a sizzling 36-ball fifty with a fast-handed sweep for six! Never mind 300, Scotland should be eyeing their highest ODI title: 341 for nine against Canada in 2014. This is getting serious for England, who have been unusually sluggish all day.28th over: Scotland 183-2 (MacLeod 41, Berrington 33) MacLeod ks Willey through the covers for four more. The absence of Ben Stokes means England only have five bowlers plus Joe Root. I would get Root on here because Willey is going round the Grange. 27th over: Scotland 176-2 (MacLeod 36, Berrington 32) Berrington charges Moeen and belts him straight for a one-bounce four. That’s a cracking stroke. Scotland have been really impressive and should make at least 300. Something might be happening here. 26th over: Scotland 167-2 (MacLeod 35, Berrington 24) Scotland have targeted Willey with great success. His six overs have gone from 48, including eight from that last one. Berrington hit his first four, a classy drive down the ground. “I have a few reservations about the England bowling line-up in general and was a bit surprised by Morgan’s comment that we don’t need Archer as there’s a long queue of bowlers fighting for selection,” says Tom van der Gucht. “However, I’m not so sure. Our trump card in one-day cricket is a batting unit that feels confident at chasing down any total, but we could do with a couple more wicket-taking options to reduce some of those big targets in the first place. Ball just seems to remain a bit fast-medium right arm and doesn’t seem to threaten, or offer, as much as a genuine quick.”I think the first choice attack of Wood, Woakes, Plunkett, Stokes, Rashid and Moeen is pretty strong, but the depth keeps me awake most night. I hope Tom Curran gets some games this summer. If they fast-track Archer I think he’ll be in the World Cup squad, despite Morgan’s comments the other day.25th over: Scotland 160-2 (MacLeod 34, Berrington 18) MacLeod, who looks in excellent touch, sweeps Moeen for consecutive boundaries – and it would have been three but for some brilliant fielding by Willey. MacLeod is a dangerous player, with three ODI scores in excess of 150. Not many players have managed that. Actually, here’s a quiz question: who is the only England batsman with three ODI scores of 150+?24th over: Scotland 148-2 (MacLeod 23, Berrington 17) David Willey replaces the excellent Rashid (7-0-39-1), who has three overs left to bowl later in the innings. Five from an entirely forgettable over. 23rd over: Scotland 143-2 (MacLeod 21, Berrington 14) Berrington is struggling to keep pace with the other batsmen, despite that six off Rashid. A single off Moeen’s fifth ball takes him to 15 from 30 deliveries. Everyone else has scored at more than a run a ball.22nd over: Scotland 141-2 (MacLeod 20, Berrington 14) A low full toss from Rashid is swept for four by MacLeod, who has quietly moved to 20 from 19 balls. Scotland are still on course for 300. MacLeod survives an optimistic LBW appeal from a googly later in the over. 21st over: Scotland 131-2 (MacLeod 10, Berrington 13) Moeen’s second over is milked for five. What more is there to say?20th over: Scotland 126-2 (MacLeod 8, Berrington 11) Berrington, with the minimum of fuss, dumps Rashid’s first ball over long-on for six. That’s followed by five dot balls, with Rashid demonstrating all his variations. He’s bowled a lot of googlies today.19th over: Scotland 120-2 (MacLeod 8, Berrington 5) Moeen Ali comes on to replace Plunkett (4-0-29-1). He’s out of the Test team but is an almost irreplaceable member of the ODI side. He has an unsuccessful LBW against MacLeod, who is hit in the stomach when he misses a sweep he was outside the line of off stump. England have frittered their review anyway. Four runs from the over. 18th over: Scotland 116-2 (MacLeod 6, Berrington 3) Berrington is dropped off Rashid, a really sharp low chance to Root at slip. It was another good delivery from Rashid, a googly that took the edge of Berrington’s attempted drive.“Morning Rob,” says Simon McMahon. “As a follower and supporter of the England cricket team for over 30 years now, I’ve got mixed feelings today. What’s wrong with me, it’s Scotland v England for goodness sake!! It should be simple, but cricket’s never that, is it? Can it be a tie? And though I’m over the West Indies heartache, imagine if this was in the World Cup...”17th over: Scotland 112-2 (MacLeod 4, Berrington 1) It’s much more sedate now, as you’d expect with two new batsmen at the crease, and Plunkett gets through an over that costs just four. “It was hard to miss S Sub’s Brexit comments!” says Tom Bowtell. “Of course I disagree with his position, but I also find it refreshing for a sportsman to share something other than beige platitudes with the world. For me, he’s the definition of a mystery spinner and we need him to play.”I’m still uneasy about the fact he spent March in the clinic for smartphone addiction. We’ll be looking for a key wicket in a World Cup final and he’ll be all over the place because of Pinterest cravings.16th over: Scotland 108-2 (MacLeod 1, Berrington 0) That was almost a third wicket. MacLeod took a nervous single to Bairstow at mid-on and would have been short with a direct hit. Another good over from Rashid, who has changed the mood of this match he is a serious one-day bowler now.15th over: Scotland 107-2 (MacLeod 0, Berrington 0) That was the last ball of the over. I wouldn’t say are back in the game, as they were never exactly out of it, but those two wickets are very welcome.Another one gone. Cross tries to glide Plunkett through the vacant slip area but gets it too fine and Billings moved smartly to his right to take a good catch. Cross played some beautiful strokes in his 39-ball 49.14th over: Scotland 103-1 (Cross 44, MacLeod 0) “Glancing at the team on the  scorecard, I see that after all the press furore, S Sub wasn’t picked for his debut after all,” laments Tom Bowtell. “Really hope that as a left arm-wrist spinner and right handed scoop specialist batsman they blood him sooner rather than later. Do you think he has what it takes?”I think he’s got the talent but I’m worried about his character. Did you see his tweets about Brexit?Boy did England need that wicket. Two balls after being launched miles over long off for six by Coetzer, Rashid skidded one through to hit the pad in front of off and middle. He went up for LBW, though it turned out Coetzer was caught behind after an inside edge onto pad. Either way it ends a spectacular tone-setting innings: 58 from 49 balls with eight fours and two sixes. 13th over: Scotland 97-0 (Cross 44, Coetzer 52) A bit of width from Plunkett allows Coetzer to drive superbly between extra cover and mid off for four. The pitch is flat, it’s true, but Cross and Coetzer have played some glorious strokes. And there’s another! Coetzer launches Plunkett over long-off for six to bring up a quite brilliant fifty from just 44 balls. Another high-class cover drive from Cross makes it 15 from the over. This is great stuff.“I hope we didn’t pick Willey (who has been disappointing for a while now) on the back of his recent ton,” says Robert Taylor. “With Stokes out of the team we’re already a bowler light and we don’t want to have to rely on Root to bowl a few. Maybe Ball would have been a better shout?”I’m not sure about Ball he’s had some grim bowling figures in the last year. Back-up seam bowling is probably England’s biggest worry ahead of next year.12th over: Scotland 82-0 (Cross 40, Coetzer 41) For the first time in a while, England get through an over without conceding a boundary. Rashid already looks like a key man today.“I can see why England chose to bowl in this game - they like chasing a target - but it’s asking a lot of Bairstow to keep all of one innings then open the next,” says John Starbuck. “Does this never enter into consideration?”It does – which is why Sam Billings is keeping wicket. I think that’s a sensible approach.11th over: Scotland 76-0 (Cross 38, Coetzer 37) Liam Plunkett, England’s middle-overs enforcer, comes into the attack. England need him to restore some order – but Scotland get their one boundary for the over when Coetzer slices high over backward point. England won’t be panicking yet.10th over: Scotland 70-0 (Cross 37, Coetzer 32) In fact, Adil Rashid is coming on for the last over of the Powerplay. He has a big LBW appeal against Cross first ball – it’s turned down by Marais Erasmus but England decide to review. It was a googly from Rashid which seemed to be turning past leg stump. Replays confirm that was indeed the case, so England lose their only review. That, as Ian Ward says on Sky, was a bit of a desperate review from England.After a couple of nervous prods, Cross sweeps firmly round the corner for yet another boundary. He has 37 from 28 balls and has played beautifully. 9th over: Scotland 64-0 (Cross 32, Coetzer 31) Coetzer gets his fifth boundary, and the 12th of the innings, with a majestic back-foot drive off Wood. A swipe over mid-on goes for four more, and England look pretty clueless at the moment. I’m sure we’ll see some spin once the Powerplay has finished.8th over: Scotland 56-0 (Cross 32, Coetzer 23) Willey is mowed over midwicket for four by Coetzer. When the ball doesn’t swing he looks fairly ordinary, certainly in comparison to Chris Woakes, and Cross puts him away for three consecutive boundaries later in the over to take Scotland past fifty. A steer to third man was followed by a withering pull round the corner and a lovely push-drive through extra cover. Willey’s four overs have disappeared for 36.7th over: Scotland 39-0 (Cross 20, Coetzer 18) A short ball from Wood is back cut to the short boundary by Cross, another accomplished shot. They have batted excellently on what looks a belting pitch.6th over: Scotland 35-0 (Cross 16, Coetzer 18) Scotland will be looking for a big total on this pitch, maybe 300. Coetzer continues their fine start with a muscular drive over mid-off for four off Willey. The ball is making a beautiful sound of the bat this morning – almost as good as this.5th over: Scotland 31-0 (Cross 16, Coetzer 14) For somebody who feels integral to this team, Wood has a surprisingly mediocre ODI record: 27 wickets at 46 apiece. He almost gets his 28th wicket when Cross, beaten for pace, top-edges a hook that just beats the man running back from square leg.4th over: Scotland 28-0 (Cross 14, Coetzer 13) A wide half-volley from Willey is square-driven nicely for four by Cross, who then plays a gorgeous back-foot push-drive that races to the cover boundary. That was a beautiful stroke.3rd over: Scotland 20-0 (Cross 6, Coetzer 13) Coetzer pulls Wood over the top for a couple. He was slightly beaten for pace but got enough on it to clear square leg comfortably. Coetzer gets his first boundary later in the over, driving handsomely through the covers. It’s been a good start for Scotland and Coetzer gets four more with a risky on-drive that just beats the ing Willey at mid-on.2nd over: Scotland 8-0 (Cross 6, Coetzer 1) A poor ball from Willey, short and wide, is belted emphatically to the cover boundary by Cross. No early swing for Willey, and this looks a decent pitch as well.1st over: Scotland 1-0 (Cross 1, Coetzer 0) Mark Wood starts the innings with an excellent over, in which he beats the outside edges of both Matt Cross and Kyle Coetzer. The captain Coetzer is the key wicket for England – he has a superb ODI record.“Morning Rob,” says Phil Sawyer. “Am I the only one who would quite like England to lose today? Not because I want England to lose, but because I want Scotland to stick two great big fingers up to the ICC and the power brokers who could only think about securing their own pieces of the pie and shrinking the World Cup so that the very idea that it’s a World Cup becomes laughable. Unexpectedly angry and serious one up from me for starters. Normal larking about will be resumed later.”After a stirring bagpipe rendition of Flower of Scotland, the players are ready to go.There’s plenty of other cricket going on today. You can follow all the county action with our live blog.Dylan Budge makes his ODI debut for Scotland. England have a few players missing – Stokes, Woakes, Buttler – but still look very strong.Eoin Morgan says it looks like a good wicket we know that England like to chase. Kyle Coetzer says he’d have been happy to bat or bowl first.A bit of pre-match readingA bit of news on Jimmy Anderson (from an ECB press release)England and Lancashire seamer Jimmy Anderson will take a six-week period of rehabilitation on a long-standing right shoulder injury.He will miss Lancashire’s next two County Championship matches against Worcestershire at Blackfinch New Road (June 20) and the match against Hampshire on June 25.“We have five Tests against India in a six-week period from August 1, which will be an intense and challenging period for all our bowlers, and therefore it’s vital that we ensure Jimmy goes into that series in the best possible condition,” said Trevor Bayliss, the England coach.“Jimmy has to manage the issue with his right shoulder, and we’ve been advised that the best way for him to prepare for the India series is to take a six-week break from cricket now, initially to rest it and then to work slowly back to cricket.“That six-week period covers Lancashire’s two Championship matches over the next three weeks. We will then monitor to see where Jimmy is at and ensuring he is ready for the India series.”Hello. Strange times are these in which we live. Donald Trump is US president, grown adults communicate in hashtags and emojis. And strangest of all – you know exactly where this is going, don’t you - England are the best ODI side in the world. Over the next few weeks they will hope to confirm that status, and their concomitant position as favourites for next year’s World Cup. They have series against Australia (five matches) and India (three matches) to come, but their white-ball summer starts with this one-off ODI against Scotland in Edinburgh. Scotland have improved massively in recent times, and were desperately unfortunate not to qualify for the World Cup. But it would still be mighty strange if they beat England for the first time in their history.Play starts at 11am.

She returns to perform an adaptation of two stories by the Marquis de Sade, Justine (1791) and Juliette (1797), which turns into a debate between embodiments of humiliated virtue and exultant vice. There are few more expressive actors than Huppert but, having seen her perform in Paris in Shakespeare and Marivaux, I wish she would appear here in a classic play rather than performing, for one night only, a solo recital. Although standing at a lectern and reading the texts in French, with English surtitles above, Huppert does vigorously enact Sade’s two polarised siblings. Juliette is a worldly libertine who embraces pleasure, even when it involves cruelty and murder, and Huppert endows her with a mocking defiance and rejects conventional morality with a wealth of dismissive shrugs. In contrast, the convent-educated Justine maintains her piety even when being sodomised by monks or subjected to unspeakable torments by a rapacious forger Huppert, with hands clasped in prayer or eyes imploringly raised to heaven, indicates the consolation of faith.The problem lies with the texts themselves. Sade presents us with an artificial choice between two extremes, takes a gloating delight in torture and sanctions a form of social Darwinism in which the strong invariably triumph over the weak. He also dresses up pornography with a good deal of windy philosophising that led one recent translator, David Coward, to describe him as “the Great Unreadable”. He is not, however, unactable as Huppert proves. She structures the stories to present us with an argument between Juliette and Justine, and differentiates the characters physically and vocally as well as through lighting changes. Her Juliette is full of expansive gestures, not least when deriding God, and announces with voluptuous, deep-throated delight her worship of crime. As Justine, Huppert’s voice suddenly becomes lighter in texture and her movements more confined, as if subservient to a higher power. Even if listening to the words of Sade involves a good deal of pain, there is a compensatory pleasure in watching Huppert."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/00ef6928f406f2d589f0502e48c3b0773ae6aacc/0_474_3450_2070/master/3450.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aac10337c844933b74501b784195897f","title":"human cost kindle amazon china foxconn jeff bezos","story":"In the Chinese city of Hengyang, we find a fatigued, disposable workforce assembling gadgets for Amazon, owned by the world’s richest man.by  Gethin Chamberlain in Hengyang, ChinaFive o’clock in the morning and the young woman’s eyelids are drooping. All night she has been removing spots of dust from Amazon smartspeakers with a toothbrush. Time seems to crawl. Now she is overwhelmed with exhaustion.She works on, more and more slowly, until she can do no more. She looks around the workshop. Other workers have rested their heads on the bench. She slumps forward and falls asleep.Let’s call the young woman Alexa. Alexa, what are you doing here?For an answer, we must fast forward a couple of months to last Monday. It is an overcast morning in the city of Hengyang, in the southern Chinese province of Hunan. More than seven million people live in this city, the second-largest in the province. It is known locally as the Wild Goose City, for the birds that used to stop off on their southerly migration, but many people even within China would struggle to find it on a map.The morning is warm but overcast, with a light haze that could be fog or pollution. The road to the Foxconn factory in Baishazhou Industrial Park is wide and lined with well-cared-for plants. There’s a steady stream of cars, motorbikes and buses heading towards the factory, which sits back from the road behind a large gate. Blue-uniformed security staff keep watch on those coming in and the street outside.Dozens of workers are arriving, casually dressed in jeans and T-shirts. Most are young and there is a good mixture of women and men. Ahead of them lies a 60-hour week, eight regular hours for five days, plus two more of overtime each day and another 10 on Saturday. They will be expected to hit tough targets and must ask permission to use the toilets. The overtime – up to 80 hours a month – is far in excess of the 36 hours stipulated in Chinese labour laws, but companies can and do seek exemptions and workers want the overtime, to boost their basic pay.These are the people who are making the smart speakers and tablets that Amazon hopes to make a fixture in millions more homes around the world this year: the Echo and Echo Dot – which both spring to life when the user addresses them as Alexa – and the Kindles.It is a year since Amazon sealed a deal with the giant Foxconn company to ramp up its hardware production in Hengyang, with the Chinese firm reportedly adding 30 new production lines and creating 15,000 jobs.The Foxconn factory in Hengyang relies on the tried and tested formula of low wages and long hours. But here there is another element: the extensive use of agency workers who don’t have the security of a regular job.These employees – known as dispatch workers in China – are hired in from labour companies as an off-the-shelf workforce. They are generally slightly better-paid than permanent members of staff, but they get no sick pay or holiday pay and can be laid off without any pay at all during quiet months when production drops off. In some ways they resemble the Amazon products they are making: wanted one day and discarded the next.Bezos is worth an estimated £102bn, a fortune he acquired against a backdrop of global reports of misery for Amazon’s warehouse workers, exhausted by the demands made on them in return for the most basic of wages. Unions and labour rightsgroups have protested about low pay and harsh working conditions, and three delivery firms used by Amazon are facing a legal challenge from the GMB union, demanding that gig economy delivery drivers receive sick pay and holiday pay.Last month it was revealed that ambulances had been called 600 times to Amazon’s UK warehouses over the past three years. There have been repeated calls for Amazon to improve the lot of its workers.But Bezos doesn’t see the need. Collecting an award for “outstanding personalities who are particularly innovative, and who generate and change markets, influence culture and at the same time face up to their responsibility to society” a couple of months ago, he was questioned about the controversies surrounding the way he made his money.“When you’re criticised,” he said, “first look in the mirror and decide: are your critics right? If they are right, change. Don’t resist.”But Bezos’s mirror apparently showed him that his critics were wrong. “I’m very proud of our working conditions and very proud of the wages we pay,” he told the audience gathered to fete him.And now he and Gou have brought that same formula to Hengyang. But what draws two of the world’s richest men to set up in a city far from the big manufacturing hubs of Shenzhen, Shanghai, Tianjin and Guangzhou, with their easy access to shipping and huge industrial bases?For an answer, it helps to know that Alexa is working for 14.5 yuan an hour (£1.69). That’s £1 less than the £2.69 national average for a factory worker in China. Foxconn could not pay her so little in Shenzhen, where the legal minimum wage is 19.5 yuan an hour, or in Shanghai, where it is 20 yuan.Some days Alexa gets to work overtime. But when she opens her wage slip at the end of the month she will be disappointed, because she and her fellow dispatch workers are paid only the same 14.5 yuan rate that they get for the main shift, instead of the time-and-a-half stipulated by Chinese labour law and Amazon’s own supplier code of conduct.Foxconn promises agency workers a minimum of 3,700 yuan a month (£431.64), but pay slips and workers’ own accounts suggest real wages rarely get close to that figure. Most earn between 2,000 and 3,000 yuan, with permanent staff earning between 2,000 and 2,500 yuan. In 2017, the average wage for a worker in Hengyang was 4,647 yuan a month.Pay rates have rocketed in China in recent years, but Hunan remains one of the provinces with the lowest wages, and the minimum in Hengyang – 1,280 yuan a month – is barely half that in Shenzhen, where Foxconn’s Apple factory is based.That Shenzhen factory has been the subject of years of criticism for its treatment of staff manufacturing iPhones and other Apple devices – with 14 suicides in 2010 prompting the installation of netting around the factory dormitories to catch workers jumping from the roofs.Now rewind again, back to March. It is early evening and Alexa is getting off the bus and entering the factory for the night shift. She has secured a job as a dispatch worker through the Qizhong labour company – one of six supplying the factory – and has joined the production line making Amazon’s mini smart speaker, the Echo Dot.Alexa looks much like the other young women around her, but she has a secret. Alexa has been sent in undercover by the US-based labour rights investigator China Labor Watch to find out what is going on behind the security gate. It is the first time anyone has investigated Amazon’s production lines, and CLW has teamed up with the Observer (and the Sunday Mirror) to publish the findings. Its own report – Amazon Profits from Secretly Oppressing its Supplier’s Workers – is published online today.Alexa is early, like all the other workers. They know that they must leave time to clear security and be at their workstations for the 8pm start, though they won’t be paid for turning up early. She notices that the temperature inside the workshops is noticeably higher than outside and the anti-static gloves she has to wear quickly make her hands sweat.Every day when she returns to the company dormitory she shares with five other women, she jots down what she has seen in her diary: the monotonous work the colleagues complaining about sore backs and the bright lights that make their eyes tired the overwhelming sense of exhaustion. She notes that workers must ask permission from a supervisor to go to the toilet, and how some workers are left in tears when they are told off by their line manager.Today Alexa has to clean 1,400 Echo Dot speakers with a toothbrush dipped in rubbing alcohol to remove any specks of dust. Four-and-a-half hours into the shift, she is already flagging.“I was already so tired and my movements grew slower,” she writes later. “I brushed with less and less force. There were 20 or 30 speakers building up in front of me that I had yet to brush clean.“The speakers that remained to be cleaned kept building up in front of me. The line technician came over and told me to brush faster and that my movements were too slow … but I no longer had any strength.”Another day she chats to an older woman sitting opposite her.“The woman across from me said that she had been brushing for so long that her hand was growing numb, her neck was sore, her back was sore, her eyes couldn’t see clearly, and her vision was getting worse …”Another worker tells her she, too, is suffering: “While working at the same work position and doing the same motions over and over again each day, she felt exhausted and her back was sore and her neck, back and arms could barely take it any more.”Alexa’s diary makes no happier reading the following day. A woman of about 45 tells her how she has been scolded because she is not fast enough: “It might be because she was getting older so her speed was slower and her reactions were slower. When the line leader was telling her off, she started crying. After I returned to the dorm, an older woman … said that last time the line leader told her off, she also cried.”She describes long nights of repetitive and relentless work, with fellow workers close to falling asleep on their feet. During a break about midnight she sees that “many people were resting on the assembly line and sleeping, while others had pushed together some chairs and were sleeping on those. Some had even stacked together some foam boards and slept on top of them.”She finds little relief on returning to the dormitories, where she notes that there is no emergency escape plan in case of fire and “escape routes are unlabelled”. Workers complain about the living conditions, including leaks in the roof and lights in the showers not working.Alexa’s diary records her own frustrations on the production line and how she is overwhelmed by tiredness: “In my mind, I was both furious and lamenting as my hands continued the repetitive motions. My hands started feeling sore, but I managed to make it to 3am.“Around 4am, the workers across from me stopped working. I continued observing. The workers across from me told me I didn’t need to watch any more as the quota had already been reached. At this time, I saw that some of the people in the work positions behind us had also stopped and were sitting due to lack of work. I felt very tired so I rested my head on the assembly line. After a while, the line technician came over and tapped me and said I couldn’t sleep on the assembly line, so I sat up again.”At the end of the shift, Alexa leaves the workshop and goes to collect her phone from her locker: “There were a lot of people squatting or sitting on the kerbside, eating a boxed lunch or playing with their phones. They all looked exhausted.”Talk in the factory is of agency workers being laid off without pay during quiet periods: 700 in April and May, and 2,700 in January and February. Yet among the workers there is no great simmering anger, no burning resentment. Few have heard of Amazon or Bezos. They aren’t expecting very much and aren’t particularly disappointed when not very much is exactly what Foxconn and Amazon give them.One 32-year-old married man says he can earn a basic 2,000 yuan (£233) a month making Kindles, but even with overtime taking it up to around £315 it is not enough.“Currently, the wages are very low. I hope to be able to earn around 3,000 to 5,000 yuan a month. Though I doubt I can earn this on a consistent basis.” At least it is better than being a dispatch worker, he says. “The factory just fires them.”But a 19-year-old dispatch worker disagrees. He says he can earn 145 yuan a day if he works a couple of hours’ overtime and just accepts it when he is laid off: “The factory will schedule holidays for dispatch workers. Around half a month to a month. I just stay at home. It is OK.”“This violates Chinese labour law. Foxconn uses a large number of dispatch workers and violates workers’ interests via these dispatch companies. This practice is unethical and illegal,” he wrote.“I hope that you can compel your suppliers to improve their working situations and to manufacture Amazon products under ethical conditions.”But Amazon already knew this, because Alexa was not the only person running a ruler over the Foxconn factory in March. Amazon says that its own auditors also visited, and picked up “two issues of concern” – the high volume of dispatch workers and the illegal underpayment of overtime. Foxconn was told to fix it.Kara Hartnett Hurst, Amazon’s head of worldwide sustainability, responded to Li Qiang’s concerns, telling him: “Amazon takes reported violations of our supplier code of conduct extremely seriously. Amazon recognises our responsibility to ensure the wellbeing of factory workers manufacturing products for Amazon.”The company had, she said, a code of conduct for suppliers and it used independent auditors to inspect its suppliers, who were expected to respond to any issues identified.Last year, Bezos announced that he was considering a philanthropy strategy, “helping people in the here and now – short term – at the intersection of urgent need and lasting impact”.Apparently short of inspiration and unable to think of anything close to home, he took to Twitter to ask for suggestions. Today’s report suggests he might have been better off just asking Alexa."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0df5ae6c959cd6b70204641c9d26ee06f8b50b15/0_212_3533_2120/master/3533.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5f1dfb3c57c5771c98ab788644dcac4d","title":"fast tracked amsterdam eurostar direct new hotels","story":"Now only a non-stop train ride from London, the Dutch capital offers calm beauty and eco innovation amid the beery hedonismI stood for a long time staring at the sign in the lobby of the Conscious Hotel, in Amsterdam’s Westerpark. A very long time. “Eco Sexy!” the sign read, like the Tinder bio of a freshly orced vegan, or the aftermath of a tragic word bomb, with two fatalities and one jaunty exclamation mark. Eco Sexy also appears on the website, and in various emails. They are very pleased with this phrase, to the degree that I asked a Dutch speaker if perhaps there is some glitch in the translation. There is not. But – and don’t worry, I hate myself for saying this, no need for you to as well – in using this phrase, these words stapled together, they have a point.This, the fourth property from Dutch sustainable brand Conscious, is the first hotel in the Netherlands to be powered entirely by wind. It’s genuinely eco (desks are made out of recycled yogurt pots) and it’s genuinely sexy, if you, like me, are gently turned on by high-ceilinged rooms panelled with blond wood, and growing walls spilling with foliage, and views over Westergasfabriek, the first park in the Netherlands to offer free wifi to all. So civilised!We arrived in Amsterdam at night, on Eurostar’s new direct train from London St Pancras (there are two trains a day, a journey time of just over three and a half hours), and something was rumbling. It wasn’t until morning that I learned we’d arrived on the eve of King’s Day, marking the birth of King Willem-Alexander. Across the city, locals were dragging their unwanted books and clothes into the street to sell, and young people (many having made the journey from the UK) were gathering for the piss-up of the year. From a distance we heard the dull thump of a soundsystem – as the day went on, the music got louder. But while stag-like groups of tourists were dancing a mile down the road, outside the Conscious Hotel in Westergasfabriek, a bouncy castle was inflated for the city’s kids, excitedly selling their old toys for €1 a pop.It’s something that gives Amsterdam a unique and joyful tension, this constant balancing of calm beauty with beery hedonism. Look to the left, a slim dark house whose interiors, visible through windows the size of Wales, leave one breathless look to the right, a fistful of Liverpool fans in mankinis pissing richly into the canal.The new Conscious Hotel isn’t the only innovative place to stay. This city is reinventing the boutique hotel in new and creative ways. Sweets Hotel is slowly transforming Amsterdam’s 28 bridge houses (built between 1673 and 2009) into one-of-a-kind hotel suites. There’s no lobby, no porter – the whole city becomes the hotel, with its rooms scattered along the water. One has a facade of glass and mint-green cement, another, in a periscope-like structure near Centraal Station, has a bed enclosed by a bright pink curtain, a room within a room. Once home to bridge operators (now redundant due to automated systems), these structures have been adapted to create modern little retreats right on the canal. There are currently 11 which take reservations along the city’s 60 miles of canals, with 10 more to open before 2019. Expect a bed, a shower, a shelf, and a view. That’s it.A more luxurious waterside conversion was recently completed on the impressive Herengracht – the “Gentlemen’s Canal”. The Waldorf Astoria comprises an imposing terrace of six mansions, knocked through but preserving many of the existing 17th- and 18th-century features, including Rococo details, ceiling paintings and a staircase that beckons you to sweep down it, grandly.

Beside the spa is a pool with doors on to one of the largest private gardens in the city, where, as we peered through the glass, a rainbow of manicured tulips was dewy with rain.We took a languid canal trip through the storm – the canal, we heard, is composed of 1m mud, 1m water and 1m bikes – then visited the Anne Frank house, where a man called Barry showed us into the museum where they’re undergoing a major renewal project. It was later that I saw him again online, explaining to a Jewish magazine how he’d been banned from wearing a kippah to work, because it might “endanger the neutrality” of the foundation. “Here of all places, where Anne Frank was forced to hide because of her identity, I have to hide my Jewish identity?” he said. Awaiting an enquiry, he was wearing his kippah that day, shepherding the queues of coach tours and kids.Every detail of the afternoon, from the museum’s descriptions of creeping antisemitism to Barry standing sentry in the rain, felt uncomfortably weighted. Afterwards, we ate apple pie at the café Winkel 43 in a kind of silence.Though the intention was to open the full Eurostar route last month, the return leg currently feels more like a long haul flight. At the end of the platform a glass Eurostar waiting area stands locked and dark and slightly embarrassed. Rather than that luxurious direct journey, you take a Thalys train to Brussels, go through snail-like security checks, then finally the Eurostar to London. A new Tracey Emin neon greets passengers off the train in St Pancras station, many of whom emerge still smelling sweetly of weed. I Want My Time With You, it says, but everyone walks past with their head down as if replying: “Not now, love.”There’s something glorious about the idea of bringing Amsterdam closer to the UK, with all its beer and beauty, its elegant cobbled history. But while it’s wonderful for us Brits, able to pop over for a short weekend without extending our carbon footprint too far, stepping over a puddle of orange vomit on the way to the station – remnants of a lairy stag do – made me feel quite apologetic for our inevitable influx.

On one side of the screen sits producer Mike Holt, a lovely bear of a man in a lumberjack shirt – he’s usually found producing the boxing show Fighting Talk. Next to him are BBC shift worker Alex Healey drinking a sugar-free Red Bull, and assistant producer Alex Entwistle (“there’s no H in my ’wistle,” he points out, helpfully). The mood is one of fast-paced, drivetime-flavoured perkiness. “Don’t be fooled,” Mike says brightly. “We were all crying two hours ago.”Launched in March, the BBC podcast is about something that on paper sounds very hard to sell: what it’s like to have cancer, presented by a woman who has it (Bland), and two who have recently gone into remission (James and Mahon). Consistently popular on the overall iTunes chart, You, Me and the Big C peaked in March at No 3, with a glut of five-star ratings. Bland, 40, a BBC News and 5 Live presenter, is its de facto host. James, 36, is a deputy headteacher turned Sun cancer columnist, while Mahon, 32, blogs at GirlvsCancer. Her site’s tagline is “for badass women making cancer their b*tch”. Its main picture is of her topless, two middle fingers covering her nipples.Today’s recording has been particularly tough. Bland announced two days earlier on her blog, Big C Little Me, that her cancer has returned, and is now classed as metastatic, which means it’s essentially incurable. “I feel like a grenade with the pin out,” her post goes. “Just waiting for some odd sensations to appear. Tick tock.”You wonder about the effects of ulging such devastating personal news, but this show has been a rock, Bland insists, as the recording wraps up and we decamp to a table in the BBC’s offices. “We wanted to create a space where you feel like you’re sitting down with girls like you, having a cup of tea, talking about it like it’s EastEnders. Do you know what I mean?” She speaks seriously, without irony. “Because when you have a conversation about it, you normalise it.”Not that Bland was sure the show would work – she hadn’t even met her colleagues until the first day of recording. But since then they have explored many issues, such as mental health, money, fertility and chemotherapy, with aplomb. “We never imagined it would have worked out this way, actually. Did you, at the start of this?” Bland turns to her friends, one by one. James gurns and shakes her head. Lauren Mahon agrees: “Jesus, no.” “But it’s provided me with so much strength,” Bland continues, “and if we don’t record together, we really miss each other.”You, Me and the Big C started to come together in January after Bland went to her BBC bosses with an idea. She was diagnosed with breast cancer in November 2016 after finding a lump under her arm she had just finished breastfeeding her son, Freddie, now two, and was trying for another child with her husband, Steve. The simple act of putting these sentences to paper creates an air of tragic narrative, of course, but these are simply some of the facts about Rachael Bland’s life. There are others, which is why her podcast exists.Bland found regular advice channels and forums unhelpful, an experience the other two echo – “I got handed a leaflet in the hospital,” says Mahon, leaning in, “and I looked at this woman on it, ill, with a scarf on her head, and went, uh-uh, that’s not me” (she was diagnosed with grade 3 breast cancer in 2016, a few months before Bland). More useful were the like-minded souls Bland discovered on social media, particularly on Instagram Stories, where lots of women – although there are men too, she adds quickly, and many young people – post about living their ordinary lives around their treatment. “You realise quickly that everybody feels really lonely. But these two” – she jabs out her thumbs at her friends – “were my absolute favourites.”We talk about how little the community aspect of social media is celebrated today, particularly the ways it helps women join together in endlessly positive ways against sexism, sure, but also by underlining the language in which women actually speak. “You also don’t want to talk to someone you’ve known all your life when you’ve got cancer,” James adds (she was diagnosed with stage 4 bowel cancer in December 2016). “You want to talk to somebody who understands what it’s actually like.”The podcast studio space seems to take all filters away, becoming a confessional booth. Then the inevitable happens: your family and friends listen in. “And they all find out things. Like your dad said it was the first time he’d realised…” Bland turns to James. “What did he say on the pod?” “It was the first time he’d realised how scared I was of my own cancer because I’d never really spoken about it,” says James. She is referring to a particularly moving show in April, which saw the women step aside for Bland’s husband, James’s father, and Mahon’s brother to speak together about their experiences, along with cricket commentator Jonathan Agnew, whose wife has had breast cancer. (5 Live commentators are often added to the show’s mix, and the varied stories from familiar voices works brilliantly.)There have been some lively recordings. One day in April, Deborah turned up in what she calls her “poo suit”: a poo-emoji fancy dress outfit sized for a six-year-old. “I bought it when I was still a little bit inebriated from the general anaesthetic,” James explains she wore it during Bowel Cancer Awareness Week, knowing that people would wonder why she was dressed that way on social media, and then discover her talking about the symptoms sooner than they would read a leaflet. Then there was the fertility episode featuring Olympian athlete Steve Barry, who had a testicle removed as part of his treatment. The moment where Mahon inquires if he now produces half of what he used to is priceless.The women got criticism, of course, for not including men in their presenting team. “Literally before the podcast had even launched,” Mahon moans. “I’m sorry, I can’t talk about testicular cancer, my love, I don’t have balls, contrary to rumour.” She shrugs. “There’s always going to be someone who’ll be like, ‘All right, princess, calm down’, isn’t there? Oh no, you’re one of those. Blocked.” The show’s bold humour hasn’t encountered much criticism, however – the presenters know that it helps draws people into a subject that might otherwise be too difficult to contemplate.The episode in which the women go from discussing fertility to how they told their children about their cancer, to my ears, is the toughest – James’s children, Hugo and Eloise, are old enough to understand its implications, she says, being nine and seven respectively. I broach the subject gently today considering Bland’s news James wells up, and the subject moves along quickly. “Some topics are so close to where it really hurts, they’re, you know…” She stops. “It’s quite emotional.” And yes, they’ve had meltdowns after recording some episodes. “It is the processing of a trauma,” Mahon says. “But the reward – that sense of unity, that we’re in this together, and knowing that it’s helping other people... I’ll take that any day.”And yes, the women cry as much as they laugh, they say. There were tears again at the end of today’s recording, when James’s oncologist credited her for her attitude throughout her treatment (the women are delighted by the positive feedback they’ve had from doctors and nurses listening to the show). Are there things they’d never discuss? No, they insist. What’s more, they’re facing Rachael’s diagnosis in the only way they know how: they’ve just announced a new series, which begins recording in a few months. A few months ago, Bland had messaged her colleagues to say she wasn’t sure she was going to make it to the end of the series. “And Debs was like: ‘Shut up, Rachael, stop being so over-dramatic.’ Which is exactly what I wanted to hear.”You, Me and the Big C is available to download now on iTunes and BBC iPlayer"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b7de9fc5ccea264d43fc977ee93ba4af53167287/0_121_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ba40a5a047b1678cdc1e43445da12ce9","title":"judge blocks deportation new york pizza worker army delivery","story":"A federal judge on Saturday temporarily blocked the deportation of a New York pizza shop worker to his native Ecuador after he was arrested while making a delivery to a Brooklyn army base. Attorneys for the Legal Aid Society obtained the temporary stay for Pablo Villavicencio after a hearing in Manhattan federal court. The 35-year-old married father of two young girls was arrested on 1 June while making a delivery to the garrison in Fort Hamilton. A background check revealed there was a warrant for his arrest for immigration law violations. Federal judge Alison Nathan granted the stay until 20 July. Villavicencio will remain in Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) custody in New Jersey until his case goes to court. New York governor Andrew Cuomo had asked federal homeland security officials to look into the case, saying recent detentions raise significant legal questions. In a letter to the Ice office in New York, the Democrat said Villavicencio’s “expedited removal serves no legitimate public safety purpose and the circumstances leading to his arrest and detention raise serious legal and policy concerns”.Villavicencio’s wife, Sandra Chica, is an American citizen and their daughters, ages two and three, were born in the US. When he arrived at Fort Hamilton, guards requested identification and he produced a city identification card. A background check showed that Villavicencio had been ordered to leave the US in 2010, but stayed. Redmond Haskins, a spokesman for the Legal Aid Society, a nonprofit organization that provides free services to clients who cannot afford them, said Villavicencio has no criminal record. Haskins said attorneys worked through the night preparing the emergency stay request that was argued in court on Saturday afternoon. “Although we are disappointed that Pablo will remained detained, today’s stay is a victory for him and his family, and also for due process and the fair administration of justice,” said Gregory Copeland, the supervising attorney of Legal Aid’s Immigration Law Unit. “This decision is also a reminder that the judiciary can still serve as a powerful check when other branches of government make hasty, cruel and reckless decisions.”  The attorneys said they will work with Villavicencio to help him secure valid immigration status."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a42615355298e2d51cc50cca24500192b37e1e53/1750_377_3545_2127/master/3545.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=14eb57c9f2320ec2e3037d96aca415b7","title":"thousands march for lgbt rights in pride parades across europe","story":"Marchers protest against discrimination in Italy, Poland and LatviaThousands of people in cities across Europe marched in pride parades to support LGBT rights on Saturday.In Rome, thousands of people took to the streets just days after Italy’s new families minister caused a storm by saying homosexual families do not legally exist.“It’s very important that we’re here, because we need to respond and show that it’s not true that we don’t exist,” said marcher Andrea. “We’re people who can have families, and when we say family, all we mean is love.”The coalition government that took power in Italy earlier this month includes the far-right, nationalist League, which has a long history of anti-gay rhetoric.In an interview with the Corriere della Sera newspaper on 2 June, the new families minister, the League’s Lorenzo Fontana, responded to a question about how his ministry would deal with families with homosexual parents, referred to in Italy as “rainbow families”.“Rainbow families exist, do they?” he replied, before qualifying his statement by saying that Italian law does not recognise such families.Same-sex civil unions have been legal in Italy since 2016, but non-biological parents do not have parental rights. Italian law only allows heterosexual couples access to fertility treatments. Speaking at the parade, Michela said she travelled from Rome to Denmark to conceive via IVF, and she and her partner now have a seven-year-old daughter.“These are heavy, hard days,” she said. “It seems like we’re going backwards rather than forwards. It’s really tiring.”Raffaele and Simone, who are from Rome and have a 14-month-old daughter, said they are tax-paying citizens and should have the same rights as everyone else.“We have been together for 11 years and we wanted to start a family, so we went abroad, to Las Vegas. We come home with her and the state doesn’t recognise our existence,” Simone said.In Bucharest, some 3,000 people marched through the city centre, with many celebrating a ruling made by the EU’s top court earlier this week.The European court of justice ruled in favour of Romanian gay man Relu Coman’s right to have his US husband, Robert “Clai” Hamilton, live with him in Romania.“Clai and I are two people who did not accept discrimination. If more of us did the same, the world would be better,” Coman said at the march.Romania does not recognise same-sex marriage and had argued that Hamilton was not entitled to EU residency rights awarded to spouses.The European court ruling means that same-sex partners of EU citizens have the right to live in any member state whatever their nationality, even in countries that do not recognise gay marriage.In Warsaw, organisers estimated 45,000 people marched in the annual “equality parade” to protest discrimination not just against LGBT people but also women, ethnic minorities and people with disabilities.“The situation in Poland is bad because same-sex couples cannot marry or adopt children,” said Alicja Nauman, who was marching with her partner Dominika Wróblewska.Thousands, including members of a LGBT police association, also turned out for the 14th edition of the pride parade in Athens. Since the leftist government took office in 2015, Greece has extended civil partnerships to same-sex couples, authorised sex changes from the age of 15 and legislated for children to be adopted by same-sex partners.The “Baltic pride” parade in Latvia’s capital Riga included members of the gay community from fellow Baltic states Estonia and Lithuania.“Latvia is in last place in the European Union when it comes to the rights of LGBT people,” one of the organisers, Kaspars Zalitis, said. “There is no protection against hate crimes, no respect for trans people – that’s why we think this issue is greatly urgent.”About 30 people protested before the start of the parade in Riga, following a call by a rightwing group for a demonstration against “the promotion of homosexuality”."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3525654.1528629994!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"water restrictions imposed on homes in co offaly","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tRestrictions began from 11pm to 6am on Thursday night and will continue nightly for the foreseeable future.Irish Water is imposing nighttime restrictions on water supplies in a bid to replenish reservoir levels in Dunkerrin, Co Offaly.The water restrictions are being put on the Dunkerrin Water Supply zone near the Tipperary border in order to allow water levels in Lisduff Reservoir to recover.

A small number of properties, those located on the extremities of the network or on higher ground may loose water supply during the restrictions.In an effort to minimise potential interruptions, Irish Water customers are being asked to conserve water by refraining from watering gardens, washing cars, using power hoses and minimising water use generally.“Every small effort to save water will contribute to maintaining supplies and benefit your entire community by reducing the likelihood of water restrictions,” the water utility said.To help conserve water customers are being asked to report any leaks they see on the public network and to repair any private side leaks in their homes and businesses to help restore water levels in the network.

Photograph: Nick BradshawIt took 35 years to build a landslide.Repealing the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution was neither quick nor easy, despite what the margin of difference might say.Sixty-six per cent said “Yes”. Makes it look simple.But that two-thirds majority conceals hard history and hard-fought battles behind a stunning final result.Woman by woman, story by story, year upon year, day after day. The rocks and pebbles of countless unjust ordeals and small personal tragedies piled up after each furtive trip to Liverpool and beyond.Brave campaigners for basic abortion rights did everything they could to increase the pressure, their efforts ignored and condemned by priests and politicians and that tiresome class of pious people who live in terror of the slippery slope.They thought they could hold back a landslide. On Friday, gravity kicked in. The slippery slope did for them in the end.The Eighth Amendment, which guaranteed a foetus the same right to life as the woman carrying it, is gone from the Constitution. Good riddance to it. It brought nothing but difficulty and despair to Irish women in times when they desperately needed proper care and compassion at home.It was a wonderful morning on Saturday in the RDS when the boxes were opened and the votes counted. It was a wonderful afternoon in Dublin Castle when crowds filled the courtyard to hear the official declaration. It was a wonderful day for Irish women.A day made even better in the happy knowledge that the vast majority of Irish men are looking out for them and want only the best for them. By voting in their droves to repeal, they placed the concerns of women far above the fears of ideologically-motivated crusaders who prize saving souls above having a heart.With repeal looking the likely outcome, there were calls from some quarters for a muted and dignified response. Perhaps it was the reason why there was neither screen nor public address system for the huge crowd at the castle.But no. For all the decades of all the women who suffered, and for all the women who fought and agitated for change, we had to celebrate this historic turning-point in modern Irish society.Some never thought they would live to see the day. Some, like Monica Barnes and Mary Holland and Nuala Fennell and many more, didn’t. The celebration was for them too.It was for Ailbhe Smyth, who never stopped fighting. It was for senator Ivana Bacik, Catherine Murphy, Joan Burton, Catherine McGuinness and many more who were there from the start.Political rivalries were cast aside for the day. “Oh, c’mere to me,” said socialist Bríd Smith, giving Fianna Fáil’s Timmy Dooley a hug.Obstetrician Peter Boylan, looking very cool in his shades turned up and it was like George Clooney had just rambled in, such was the clamour which greeted his entrance. The three co-directors of Together4Yes – Ailbhe Smyth, Orla O’Connor and Gráinne Griffin – arrived to rapturous welcome.Senators Lynne Ruane and Alice Mary Higgins were in floods. Ruth Coppinger was hugging for Ireland. Katherine Zappone, who demanded the referendum as her price for supporting the Government, was ecstatic.“Oh God, I told my husband I’d give up the fags if there was a repeal,” said Fine Gael’s Kate O’Connell, one of the party’s most active campaigners, as she ran out for a smoke.Brendan Howlin arrived in just after Mary Lou McDonald’s big entrance. The Labour party was fighting the cause when all the others didn’t want to know. “We never get the credit,” said Howlin, shrugging. “We carry the flag, but then in comes the fresh faced Leo to take all the glory.”Maybe not. Health Minister Simon Harris pretended to be embarrassed by the “I fancy Simon Harris” poster, but he was secretly thrilled. Wherever he went he was mobbed. No wonder Leo stuck close by him.Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin maintained a low-key presence, but his early intervention and support for repeal and the proposed legislation was a pivotal point in the campaign.It was a courageous move which now sees him on the right side of history and one half of his parliamentary party stranded on the other.As Micheál walked through the crowd, tearful young women hugged him. A man and woman approached. “We’re one of those couples who had a fatal foetal abnormality,” the women said to him. “Thank you. Just, thank you,” she sobbed.Meanwhile, back in the RDS, the Attorney General was chatting to former Supreme Court Judge Catherine McGuinness.She had had eye surgery the day before but the doctor gave her a special dispensation to attend the count. “Theoretically I should have a patch over my eye today.”At Dublin Castle, Frank Crummy (81), who set up Ireland’s first family planning clinic, was resplendent in his repeal jumper, alongside his wife Evelyn.There was a lot of discussion about why so many politicians and pundits called the campaign so wrong. The Together4Yes team remains amused by the old school, outmoded metric used by some of them to evaluate their very effective efforts. It was as if they were affronted at the idea that people outside the Kildare Street bubble might actually know more than they do about what the electorate really wants these days.Independent TD Clare Daly, a politician hugely deserving of credit for the part she played, decided to stay away from the castle bunfight. Instead, a number of Johnny Come Lately politicians with a weakness for self-publicity preened and waved from the platform.It’s always the same.A third of the electorate voted No. “I feel like I’ve lost my country,” a woman told us amid the celebrations in the RDS. She was very sad. She couldn’t be consoled.Cheers and tears and champagne greeted the announcement. The sky fell in briefly when a few drops of rain fell. Everyone danced.Because it was a monumental day. The day when the intelligent, compassionate citizens of Ireland turned to the Catholic Church and the retreating fundamentalists and firmly said: “Thanks, but no thanks.

Photograph: Francois LenoirReutersDowning Street has said Britain will never accept a backstop that applies only to Northern Ireland, following EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier’s rejection of an arrangement that applies to the whole of the United Kingdom. “The prime minster has been clear that we will never accept a customs border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom. We are also committed to maintaining the integrity of our own internal market. That position will not change. The commission’s proposals did not achieve this, which is why we have put forward our own backstop solutions for customs,” a government spokesperson said.“All parties must recall their commitment in the joint report to protect the Belfast agreement in all its parts. Michel Barnier has confirmed today that discussions will now continue on our proposal.”Mr Barnier rejected of two of the British backstop proposal’s most important elements – extending the backstop to the whole of the UK and making it time-limited. Nigel Dodds, deputy leader of the DUP, on whose 10 votes at Westminster Ms May depends for her majority, said his party could not agree to Mr Barnier’s proposals.“Michel Barnier’s latest comments demonstrate he has no respect for the principle of consent or the constitutional integrity of the United Kingdom. This is nothing more than an outrageous attempt to revert to the annexation of Northern Ireland. We will not accept such a proposal,” he said.Irish sources said Mr Barnier’s reaction to the British proposals was more hardline than expected, and attributed this to last minute changes made to the British paper, inserted to satisfy the hard Brexiteers in Theresa May’s cabinet.However, most sources in Dublin and Brussels said they believed that the threat of a collapse of the talks in June had receded, and that the two sides would “muddle through” the next few weeks and through the June summit, leaving most of the key issues to be settled in October.One senior figure in Dublin, however, warned of diminishing patience with Mrs May in key European capitals.There is some concern in Dublin that the question of the backstop, and the broader arrangements for the future relationship that will affect Ireland and the border, will all be settled together in the autumn, raised the prospect of Irish interests being “squeezed” as part of a wider deal.In the North, the DUP reacted with hostility to Mr Barnier’s statement. The DUP leader Arlene Foster said that the the DUP would “not tolerate the annexation of Northern Ireland” while the party’s deputy leader Nigel Dodds said that Mr Barnier “has no respect for the principle of consent or the constitutional integrity of the United Kingdom”.Earlier, the prime minister expressed full confidence in foreign secretary Boris Johnson but declined to comment on leaked remarks he made at a dinner this week. In a speech to the Conservative Way Forward group, a recording of which was leaked to BuzzFeed, Mr Johnson said the issue of the Irish Border had taken on too great a significance in Britain’s negotiations with the EU.“It’s so small and there are so few firms that actually use that border regularly, it’s just beyond belief that we’re allowing the tail to wag the dog in this way. We’re allowing the whole of our agenda to be dictated by this folly,” he said.The prime minister’s official spokesperson declined to comment directly on Mr Johnson’s comments but rejected the sentiments expressed about the issue of the Border.“Northern Ireland has been a priority for the prime minister from day one, and will continue to be so,” the spokesperson said.“It is a priority not because the EU has made it one, but because the prime minister is committed to the union and the emergence of a hard border would put that at risk. I’m not going to engage on the wording, but this is our position and why it is so vital to the prime minister.”In the speech, the foreign secretary described the Treasury as “the heart of Remain” and suggested that the aggressive, unpredictable approach Donald Trump might take to Brexit talks would have been more fruitful.During a visit to Germany on Friday, chancellor of the exchequer Philip Hammond said his experience told him that a collaborative approach was generally more productive than a confrontational one.“Finding a mutually beneficial outcome is the only way forward. That is the firm intention of my government. Theresa May, the prime minister, has said so very clearly,” Mr Hammond said.Scotland’s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, called on Ms May to sack her foreign secretary, saying his remarks at the dinner offered further evidence that he was not fit to occupy one of the great offices of state.“Any prime minister that had any semblance of authority would have got rid of Boris Johnson a long time ago, not just because of comments like this,” she said.Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce"},{"url":null,"title":"city highlights fromnational geographic travel photographer","story":"This is a selection of images from the National Geographic Travel Photographer of the Year Contest which is open for entries until May 31, 2018.The Scenic Suitcase taken by Stephanie MillerThe colorful streets of Bo Kaap weren\u0027t always this way.

because it will stop boaters from operating just in the short gaps that are the more congested areas, said IWA spokesperson Alison Stenner.Critics of the IWA say any increase the minimum mileage would benefit marina operators, leisure boaters, and holiday rental companies - at the expense of the free-roaming boating communities that have sprung up around urban areas.Since 2005 the total number of licenses issued by CRT has risen by a third to 34,207.Boats on Regents CanalThe IWA claims congestion has become problematic in Bristol, Bath, Oxford and Cambridge, as well as London, which has seen the most dramatic increase in house boats.In March CRT counted 2,050 continuous cruisers in London, up from 638 in 2012.Over the same time period Britain’s waterways have also become increasingly popular for leisure activities, like canoeing, rowing and paddleboarding.This surge in activity has a brought with it new problems and the CRT says it is frequently caught in the middle of disputes between waterway users and receives complaints on a weekly basis.Canal life in London is fast becoming dominated by younger boaters as they avoid high property prices in the cityOne boat dweller moored in London’s Regents Canal said: Some people are just looking for a cheap way to live and they don’t care about the community or the lifestyle.A Defra spokesman said there are plans to include all stakeholders in the discussion and said many had not been contacted because the review is still at an early stage.The purpose of this group is to provide a platform to discuss experiences and differing perspectives of the issues, the spokesman said.At the initial meeting held in December 2017, it was agreed that user groups could be invited to help with the group’s work and the terms of reference for the group are now being determined.A Defra spokesperson said: “It is important to balance the needs of water ways users and those who choose to live on our inland waterways.“That is why we have created a group made up of local government, the Environment Agency and navigational authorities, including the Canal and River Trust – and it has been agreed that user groups could be invited to help with its work.  “The group is in its early stages but will act as a platform for discussions to take place on a number of issues around moored houseboats.”Department for Environment, Food \u0026amp Rural Affairs (DEFRA)Canals and waterwaysPlease review our commenting policyVladimir Putin says he hopes to host G7 in MoscowCustoms backstop could still be in place in 2022, minister suggestsBoy, 8, youngest to climb Old Man of Hoy whilst fundraising for terminally ill motherBoris Becker’s Wimbledon trophies go on sale as bankrupt tennis player seeks to pay off his debtsBritain’s North Korean ambassador secretly helping Donald Trump prepare for talksDonald Trump and Kim Jong-un arrive in Singapore for North Korea summitComment: Politicians are playing a cynical game by bullying universities over equalityRise of secularism fuelling violence and verbal abuse against Christian clergyThe five photos that reveal the power plays and isions at heart of G7 talksHeart disease stem cell therapy can shrink deadly scar tissueComment: \u0026#39I came, I saw, I signed\u0026#39: Julius Caesar\u0026#39s book tour of BritanniaDonald Trump throws G7 back into disarray with tweets from Air Force OneMet Police launch 74th murder investigation of the year after stabbing in north LondonDivers find body of woman dragged into lake by 12ft alligator in FloridaDonald Trump accuses EU of \u0026#39robbing\u0026#39 US as he delivers a new snub to Theresa MayEarthquake felt across northern England as residents describe underground rumble and shaking homesCriminal gangs running illegal waste disposal dumps are to be targeted in new clampdownTrooping the Colour 2018: How the November weather brought about the Queen\u0026#39s summer birthday celebrationsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/06/10/TELEMMGLPICT000165897628_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"five photos power plays reveal divisions g7 negotiations","story":"This image, released by German officials, shows Angela Merkel in dominant pose before an American president who looks to have run out of comebacksOne moment, five photos and duelling attempts to write history and claim dominance.With the G7 summit reaching its crunch moment, five official photographs capture the tension of the talks -

google doodle","story":"Pioneering obstetrical anaesthetist credited with helping to lower US infant mortality rate celebrated in today\u0027s Google DoodleGoogle’s latest animated Doodle pays tribute to the creator of the “Apgar\u0026nbspscore”, the test still used to this day to quickly assess the health of newborn babies.Her pioneering work in comparing the wellbeing of sickly infants to healthy ones proved\u0026nbspcrucial to lowering the infant mortality rate in the US and advancing\u0026nbspthe cause of maternity care.Virginia Apgar was born in Westfield, New Jersey, on 7 June 1909 into a family of music lovers, her father an insurance executive by trade but a keen amateur astronomer and inventor.The death of her elder brother from tuberculosis and the persistent ill health of another brother, Lawrence, inspired her decision to study medicine as a young woman.Graduating from Mount Holyoke College in Massachusetts in\u0026nbsp 1929, she studied zoology and minored\u0026nbspin physiology and chemistry before finishing fourth in her class at Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons in 1933, completing a residency in surgery at the same institution in 1937.\u0026nbspShe was discouraged from continuing her career as a surgeon, which was regarded as a very male discipline at that time, and instead trained in anaesthesiology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison under Dr Ralph Waters, who had established the country’s first dedicated unit. After further study of the field at New York’s Bellevue Hospital, she returned to Columbia as director of its new anaesthesia ision, its first female head of department.Building the unit from the ground up in partnership with her old mentor Dr Allen Whipple\u0026nbsp(who had steered her away from surgery), Dr Apgar\u0026nbspworked tireless as both a practising physician and administrator, no easy task when America’s entry into the Second World War in 1941 created significant staffing shortages.Dr Apgar\u0026nbspdeveloped her five-point score for assessing\u0026nbspnewborn health\u0026nbspin 1952. The test grades babies on scores of zero to two on five key criteria: the colour of their skin, their pulse rate, their reflex ability, their responsiveness to limb flexion and their respiratory rate. The resulting scores are totted up to give a total out of 10 indicating the health or otherwise of the infant in question.The criteria can be remembered by the acronym\u0026nbsp”Apgar”, standing for Appearance, Pulse, Grimace, Activity, Respiration.In 1959, by which point her test had been rolled out across US maternity\u0026nbsphospitals, Dr Apgar\u0026nbspleft the Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center to\u0026nbspearn\u0026nbspa Master of Public Health degree from the Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health and served as vice president for medical affairs at the March of Dimes Foundation to advance the study of birth defects.She was an outspoken advocate for universal vaccinations\u0026nbspto prevent mother-to-child transmission of rubella during the pandemic that struck 12.5m people in the US between 1964-65 and contributed more than 60 articles to newspapers, magazines and academic journals, publishing her book Is My Baby All Right? with Joan Beck\u0026nbspin 1973.Dr Apgar\u0026nbspwas known throughout her career for her warm bedside manner and forthright optimism. In her personal life, she played the violin, enjoyed a range of hobbies from fly-fishing and stamp collecting\u0026nbspand took flying lessons, dreaming of swooping under the George Washington Bridge.Although\u0026nbspshe rarely campaigned against or spoke publicly about gender inequalities, Dr Virginia Apgar\u0026nbspglided past\u0026nbspthe sexism of her period with ease, preferring instead to lead by example and allow her professional excellence and commitment to her work speak for itself.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Excitement, shame, disgust, anticipation, even love… he doesn’t feel these, either. “I feel something but I’m unable to distinguish in any real way what that feeling is.” The only emotions he is familiar with are fear and anger.\u0026nbspSuch profound problems with emotion are sometimes associated with autism, which Stephen does not have, or with psychopathy, which he doesn’t have, either.Last year, at the age of 51, he finally learned what he does have: a little-known condition called alexithymia, a word made from Greek parts meaning, roughly, “no words for emotion”.Despite the name, the real problem for people with alexithymia isn’t so much that they have no words for their emotions, but that they lack the emotions themselves. Still, not everyone with the condition has the same experiences. Some have gaps and distortions in the typical emotional repertoire.Some realise they’re feeling an emotion, but don’t know which, while others confuse signs of certain emotions for something else – perhaps interpreting butterflies in the stomach as hunger pangs.\u0026nbspSurprisingly, given how generally unrecognised it is, studies show that about one in 10 people fall on the alexithymia spectrum. New research is now revealing what’s going wrong – and this work holds the promise not only of novel treatments for disorders of emotion, but of revealing just how the rest of us feel anything at all.\u0026nbspAfter working as a nurse for 10 years, Stephen decided he wanted to do something different. A two-year Access to University course led to a degree in astronomy and physics, and then to a job testing computer games.He built a successful career for himself, working for various companies in their computer testing departments, managing teams, and travelling around the world to speak at conferences. He had no problem conveying facts to colleagues.It was in the context of more personal relationships – or any other scenario that would typically involve expressions of emotion – that he felt things were “wrong”.\u0026nbsp“At the beginning of a relationship, I’m totally into who that person is,” he explains. “I’ve been told I’m very good at maintaining a honeymoon period for ‘longer than expected’. But after a year it takes a massive turn. It all falls apart. I’ve put myself on a pedestal to be this person which I’m really not. I react mostly cognitively, rather than it being emotions making me react. Obviously, that is not valid. It’s not real. It seems fake. Because it is fake. And you can only pretend for so long.”\u0026nbspHe and his current wife stopped living together in 2012. He saw a GP and was prescribed antidepressants. Though he was still in contact with his wife, it was clear that the relationship was no longer working. In June 2015, he attempted suicide.“I had actually been posting on Facebook and Twitter regarding killing myself and someone – I’ve never found out who – contacted the police. I was taken to hospital and treated.”\u0026nbspA psychiatrist referred Stephen for a series of counselling sessions and then a course of psychodynamic psychotherapy, a type of Freudian-based therapy that, in trying to uncover unconscious drivers of thoughts and behaviour, is similar to psychoanalysis.\u0026nbspIt was in a book called Why Love Matters by Sue Gerhardt, which his therapist recommended, that he first came across the concept of alexithymia.“I brought it up in therapy, and that’s when we started talking about how I was very alexithymic. Obviously, I’ve got a vocabulary. I’ve got words for emotions. But whether they’re the right words for the right emotion is a different point altogether… I just thought that I wasn’t good at talking about how I feel and emotions and stuff like that. But after a year of therapy, it became apparent that when I talk about emotions I don’t actually know what I’m talking about.”The term “alexithymic” dates from a book published in 1972 and has its origins in Freudian psychodynamic literature.Freudian ideas are now out of favour with most academic psychologists, as Geoff Bird, a professor of psychology at the University of Oxford explains. “Not to disrespect those traditions, but in the cognitive, neuro, experimental field, not so many people are really very interested in anything associated with Freud any more.”But when Bird read about alexithymia, he found the descriptions intriguing. “Actually, it’s really quite amazing.” For most people, “at a low level of emotion, you might be a bit unsure about exactly what you’re feeling, but if you have a strong emotion, you know what it is”. And yet somehow, here were people who simply did not know.\u0026nbspBird started his academic career studying autism spectrum disorder, empathy and emotional awareness, which led to his interest in alexithymia.In one of his first studies in this field, he linked alexithymia, as measured with a 20-item checklist developed at the University of Toronto, with a lack of empathy. If you can’t feel your own emotions in the typical way, it makes sense that you can’t identify with those of others, either.\u0026nbspBut what really drew Bird into alexithymia research were his interactions with people with autism. “There has been this perception that people with autism don’t have empathy. And that’s rubbish. And you can see that immediately as soon as you meet some autistic people.”In a series of studies, Bird has found that about half of people with autism have alexithymia – it’s these people who struggle with emotion and empathy, while the rest do not. In other words, emotion-related difficulties are intrinsic to the alexithymia, not to the autism.Bird is passionate about spreading this message. He talks with feeling about one particular autistic study volunteer who did not have alexithymia: “A lovely guy with an IQ we couldn’t measure, it’s that good. He couldn’t hold down a job. But he volunteered to work at a care home because he wanted to do something productive with his time.“They said, ‘Oh because you’ve got a diagnosis of autism you can’t do empathy, therefore you can’t look after our elderly people.’ Which is just ridiculous.”\u0026nbspBird has since run a series of studies exploring alexithymia outside the context of autism. He has found, for example, that people with the condition have no trouble recognising faces, or distinguishing pictures of people smiling and frowning.“But for a few of our really alexithymic people, while they can tell a smile and a frown apart, they have no idea what they are. That is really quite strange.”\u0026nbspMany of the people with the condition who Bird has met talk about being told by other people that they’re different, though some do recognise it in themselves early on.“I guess it’s a bit like not being able to see colour, and everybody’s always banging on about how red this is or how blue, and you come to realise there’s an aspect of human experience that you’re just not participating in.”As well as better characterising alexithymia, Bird and his colleagues have also dug into what explains it, taking what could seem to be a circular argument – Stephen has problems with emotion because he has alexithymia, which is characterised by problems with emotion – and blowing it right apart.In situations that Stephen recognises as being in theory highly emotional – like telling someone “I love you” – he experiences changes inside his body. “I feel my heart race and this rush of adrenaline, but to me that feeling is always scary. I don’t know how to react. It makes me want to either run away or react verbally aggressively.”\u0026nbspFear and anger – and confusion – he understands. “Everything else just feels all the same… it’s this feeling of, ‘Errrr, I’m not quite comfortable with this – it’s not quite right’.”\u0026nbsp“Similarly with anxiety, it might be that someone experiences an emotional response associated with a fast heartbeat – which might be excitement – but they don’t know how to interpret that, and they could panic about what’s happening in their body.”\u0026nbspThe ability to detect changes inside the body – everything from a racing heart to a ersion of blood flow, from a full bladder to a distension of the lungs – is known as interoception. It’s your perception of your own internal state.\u0026nbspDifferent emotions are associated with different physical changes. In anger, for example, the heart rate rises, blood rushes to the face, and fists clench. In fear, the heart rate also rises but blood drains from the face.It’s generally thought that these changes are not entirely specific to inidual emotions, and so context is also important: if you feel your heart racing and you’re looking at a spider, you know it’s fear that you’re feeling, not sexual arousal.\u0026nbspWhat Bird, Brewer and others have found in people with alexithymia is a reduced ability, sometimes a complete inability, to produce, detect or interpret these internal bodily changes. People with the condition have normal-range IQs.They can understand as well as anyone else that they’re seeing a spider, rather than an attractive potential partner. But either their brains aren’t triggering the physical changes that it seems are needed for the experience of an emotion, or other regions of their brains aren’t reading these signals properly.\u0026nbspIn 2016, Bird and Brewer, along with Richard Cook at City University in London, published a research paper that characterised alexithymia as a “generalised deficit of interoception”.Here, then, was an explanation for these people’s problems with emotion – but also, in effect, a manifesto stating that the perception of a range of bodily signals is important for the experience of emotion in the rest of us.\u0026nbspIt’s an idea that we already express in everyday language: in English, for an apology to mean anything, it has to be “heartfelt”. If you truly love someone, it’s with “all your heart”.When you’re really angry, your “blood boils”. Instead of saying that you’re anxious, you might talk about having “butterflies in your stomach” (thought to be caused by a ersion of blood flow away from the digestive system).While most people may not be familiar with alexithymia, there is a different disorder involving flat emotions and poor empathy that seems to fascinate us, even more than it repels us: psychopathy. Can we learn more about how we feel by understanding psychopaths?Lieke Nentjes is in her early thirties. She’s slender and softly spoken it’s hard to picture her spending countless hours in small rooms with incarcerated, unshackled psychopaths, including serially violent men who have committed murder.\u0026nbsp“Then he explained that he was at the end of his therapy and was ‘resocialising’ and no one would hire him because they were intimidated by him. He wasn’t really angry. He was frustrated.”While the nature of psychopathy is still debated, psychologists generally agree that it entails, among other things, a lack of empathy or guilt, shallow emotions, and antisocial behaviour – treating other people badly and, in some cases, engaging in criminal acts.\u0026nbspIt has certainly been suggested that the reason some psychopaths are able to torture or murder people is that they don’t process emotions properly – they don’t feel fear, for example, and they don’t recognise it in others.\u0026nbspNentjes is based at the University of Amsterdam. Here in the Netherlands, if a criminal is found to have a psychological condition that relates to the crime, he or she is deemed to be only partially responsible.Such criminals might spend a few years in a regular jail before being sent to a secure treatment centre, or they may be sent straight for treatment.\u0026nbspNentjes decided to assess a range of criminals from these centres and from jails to find out just how psychopathic they were (with particular attention to different aspects of psychopathy), to learn about their lives – their upbringing, and their criminal behaviour – and also to measure their interoceptive ability.\u0026nbsp“Emotion is very central when you look at psychopathy – or rather, lack of emotion,” she says. So could it be that psychopathic offenders just aren’t very in touch with their bodies?\u0026nbspIn the course of the interviews, Nentjes asked questions to probe their levels of empathy, and how much remorse they felt about what they had done to their victims. “Some were just completely honest, and would say, ‘I don’t care,’” she says.“Others who were psychopathic would say, ‘Oh, but I’m very empathic.’ They had learned the lingo to describe feelings very accurately and they could talk about compassionate, empathic feelings towards others – but then when you look at the crimes they have committed…” Her sentence trails off.\u0026nbsp“There is research finding that psychopathic offenders can describe emotions in terms of words, but they lack the inner experience of the emotion,” she adds.\u0026nbspSince assessing a person’s ability to detect a range of bodily signals is tricky, the most commonly used measures of interoceptive sensitivity are based on judgements of heart rate. One test involves asking participants to count their heartbeats over varying periods – 25 or 50 seconds, perhaps – multiple times.About 10 per cent of us are good at counting heartbeats, 5 to 10 per cent are very bad, and the rest fall somewhere in between.In another test, volunteers are played a series of beeps that are either in sync or out of sync with their heartbeat, and asked which it is. On this type of task, about 10 per cent of the general population can do it really well, and 80 per cent can’t do it at all.\u0026nbspNentjes brought the necessary equipment for the heartbeat synch task with her into the interview rooms, and took measures for 75 offenders. She found a clear link: the higher an offender’s score on the antisocial aspect of psychopathy, the poorer their performance on the heart-rate task.This does at least suggest that psychopaths who are poorer at detecting bodily signals feel less emotion and therefore less empathy for others.Psychopathic criminals are sometimes ided into the “white-collar” type, who tend to commit non-violent crimes such as fraud, and the violent type. In her interviews with this violent group, Nentjes was struck by one similarity, in particular, compared with the white-collar group.“That was their upbringing. Or rather lack of it. Emotional abuse. Sexual abuse. Neglect. A lot of physical abuse. I’ve heard people literally say that emotion is not of use to them. All they felt during their upbringing was fear.”\u0026nbspAs a child, Stephen suffered extreme emotional neglect. When he was six, his mother intentionally set fire to their home in Nottingham while she, Stephen, his younger brother and even younger sister were all inside. Fortunately, the children’s father, who had left for work, realised that he’d forgotten his packed lunch and came home.\u0026nbspLooking back, Stephen says it’s clear that his mother was suffering from post-natal depression. But she received no treatment, “and all I knew was anxiety and being worried”. After the fire, his mother went to prison. His father was a steelworker, who worked all kinds of shifts.“A neighbour contacted social services and Dad was told to sort it out or they’d take us away. None of my dad’s brothers or sisters wanted me or my brother because we were little shits. We were always in trouble. Robbing shops. All kinds of stuff. So we went into care.”\u0026nbspFor the rest of his childhood, Stephen was in and out of care homes. The only emotions he remembers feeling, even then, are fear, anger and confusion. “Christmas, birthdays, people out of the blue at care homes being nice to me… I never really got used to it. I always felt uncomfortable. There’s just a mess of feelings inside me that I don’t interpret properly, or respond to properly.”\u0026nbspAlexithymia is often associated with trauma and neglect from a young age, explains Geoff Bird. Twin studies have suggested a genetic component, too. And it’s also linked to certain types of brain damage, particularly to the insula, the region that receives interoceptive signals.\u0026nbspAs Rebecca Brewer notes, the kind of anxiety that Stephen experiences is common in people with poor interoception. At the University of Sussex, Hugo Critchley and Sarah Garfinkel, who have expertise in psychiatry and neuroscience, are looking at ways to alter interoception, to bring anxiety down.\u0026nbspGarfinkel has put forward a three-dimensional model of interoception that has been well received by others in the field. First, objective accuracy at perceiving interoceptive signals – how good you are at counting heartbeats, for example.Second, subjective report – how good you think you are. And third, metacognitive accuracy – how good you are at knowing how good you actually are.\u0026nbspThe third dimension is important because various studies have found that the gap between how good someone thinks they are at counting heartbeats, for example, and how good they actually are predicts their levels of anxiety.Lisa Quadt, a research fellow with the Sussex group, is now running a clinical trial with the aim of testing whether reducing this gap for people with autism can reduce their anxiety.In a pilot study, Critchley, Garfinkel and MSc student Abigail McLanachan recruited a group of students who came into the lab for six training sessions. In each session, they first did the heartbeat-counting task.The volunteer sat at rest, with a loose rubber pulse oximeter on their forefingers, and reported how many beats they’d counted. Then McLanachan told them how they’d done so that they got a better sense of how accurate they were.McLanachan then got them to do a few minutes of jumping jacks or walking fast up the steep hill outside the building – whatever was necessary to raise their heart rate, to make it easier to detect. (“Because some people really can’t feel their heartbeat at all. I can’t,” Quadt explains.)Then they went back into the lab, did the tasks again and, as before, were given feedback each time.\u0026nbspThis was just a pilot study on a general student population. But after three weeks, not only had the students’ accuracy improved on all three dimensions of interoception, but they also reported reductions in anxiety of around 10 per cent.\u0026nbspFor the main trial, volunteers diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder will complete the same tasks as in the pilot, but once at the start and once at the end they’ll do them inside an MRI scanner.This will allow the team to monitor activity in the insula, which receives heart-rate data, and look at how changes in that activity may correspond to connections between the amygdala, which detects threats, and the prefrontal cortex, which can work out whether a potential threat really is or is not dangerous and so whether anxiety is warranted.The hope, Critchley explains, is to see improved connectivity between these two regions, which previous studies have linked to reduced anxiety.\u0026nbspIn Oxford, meanwhile, Geoff Bird wants to look at the idea that there are two different types of alexithymia. People with one type don’t produce enough of the bodily signals necessary for the experience of an emotion, so would be unlikely to benefit from the Sussex group’s kind of training.People with the other type produce all kinds of bodily sensations but their brains don’t process these signals in the typical way. This second group, which includes Stephen, might benefit more.\u0026nbspBird stresses that, although people with alexithymia struggle to understand emotion, that doesn’t mean they don’t care about other people. “For the most part, iniduals with alexithymia can recognise that others are in a negative state, and this makes them distressed.“The problem is that they can’t work out what the other person is feeling, and what they are feeling, and therefore how to make the other person feel better or how to reduce their own distress. I think that’s important because alexithymia is different from psychopathy in that respect.”Stephen says that for him, this is certainly true. And in theory, an emotional training technique is something he would welcome. “I’ve got several books about emotions and feelings and they don’t make a jot of difference because they’re not talking specifically enough about what you actually feel within your body is which emotion.”\u0026nbspFor now, given the absence of available treatments for alexithymia, Stephen plans to use his newfound understanding of himself, gained through therapy, to try to move forwards. At first, he says, he hoped that therapy would fix everything.“I thought every day would be perfect, brilliant… and I’ve come to realise that’s not going to happen. I’m always going to have problems, always going to have issues.”\u0026nbspHe’s learned valuable lessons, he says. Though he and his wife are still separated, they talk regularly and now he tries not to reject her views on his anxiety. “Rather than go, ‘No,’ I will listen. I think, ‘Well, you know what emotions are about and I don’t, so I’m going to listen to you and I’ll either take it on board or I’ll find a way to deal with it’.”He’s also thinking about moving to work with people who are struggling with substance abuse, because he’d like to be back in a career where he can help people.\u0026nbspMost of all, he’s determined to use his diagnosis of alexithymia. “For me, it empowers me – now I know about it, I can read about it. I can find out more about it. And I can develop certain tools that enable me to combat it.”People without alexithymia could probably use such tools as well. Bird has led work showing that people who are more aware of their own heartbeat are better able to recognise others’ emotions, a crucial first step in being empathetic.He’s planning studies to investigate whether heartbeat training might therefore increase empathy.\u0026nbspThose who want to reduce feelings of stress and anxiety in daily life, but who either can’t or don’t want to change the sources of stress, could focus on changing the signals coming from their bodies instead.Regular physical exercise should dampen down the kinds of bodily signals (from the heart and circulation, for example) that the brain could interpret as being anxious – so it should dampen down feelings of anxiety, too.\u0026nbspKnowing that signals from our bodies underpin our emotions could be empowering for all of us.

Andy Martin on the man who’ll be guiding ITV viewers through a month of World Cup hyperboleEverybody is a commentator these days. @Chasepacheco1, for example, who tweeted after last month’s Uefa Champions League final:\u0026nbsp“My Liverpool team fought hard and I’m proud of them. Except for Karius, he can die in a hole.” Loris Karius, Liverpool’s German goalkeeeper, let in three goals (one of them, to be fair, a moment of sheer brilliance by Gareth Bale). Which means that online he finds himself denounced as a “Nazi”. And, according to one theory, paid handsomely for his “howlers” by Real Madrid. We can assume that the World Cup in Russia this month will be the occasion of a deluge of similar wildly overheated rhetoric, hyperbole and death threats.But you won’t be hearing any of it from ITV’s chief football commentator Clive Tyldesley. Winner many times over of the Royal Television Society Sports Commentator of the Year award, he is the voice of moderation, the calm centre at the eye of the storm. Occasionally the target of Twitter rage himself, he expects to encounter not just a lot of verbals but also racism, hooliganism, and misogyny on top. Football, he says, is “warts and all. It reflects life. It corrupts. That is part of its fascination.” But, from the heights of the commentary box, he tries to provide something like a counterpoint to all the frenzy, the agony and the ecstasy.He is a fit-looking 63 and described himself as “a respecter of vocabulary” when I went to see him shortly before the Champions League final. “I would never say it’s a ‘disaster’ or a ‘tragedy’ if the ball goes through the goalkeeper’s legs,” he said. “You only use words like that if somebody dies.” He thought he might stretch to “calamity”.\u0026nbspHis words were strangely prophetic. As it turned out that is exactly the word he selected to describe Liverpool’s “goalkeeping calamity” when Karius bowled the ball right onto the toe of Benzema. But it struck me that there was also a kind of poetry, of a restrained, austere kind, in his summary of Real Madrid’s first goal, perhaps something like an instant haiku:And Real Madrid are in front.His “an evening that had started so promisingly for Liverpool” sounded a poignantly elegiac note. I also had to admire the comment, after Karius lets a tame one by Bale slip through his hands and into the net: “His reputation would do well to survive that moment.” Note the use of the conditional tense. Tyldesley appreciates that the keeper’s reputation is already in tatters, but that – perhaps in an ideal world – it could still recover.David Hume said that you cannot get an “ought” from an “is”. Somehow Clive Tyldesley manages to pull that off. He is only describing a game of football but there is an implicit ethics in his commentary. Tyldesley agrees with Bill Shankly that football is not a matter of life and death, but omits the punchline, “it’s more important than that.” Still, it is “a huge emotional investment by all the people who turn on. They choose to watch.” Therefore, as a commentator, “You have to be careful with your use of words.”The Playstation Schools Cup U15 final, between Thomas Telford School and Carshalton Boys Sports College, held at Reading’s Madejski stadium, was as fraught and intense as any Champions League final. Some of the players even had agents already. “Maybe overdid it a bit, Hodnett,” commented Tyldesley, in his simultaneous schools broadcast, as he skyed the ball over the bar. He prepared for this game as scrupulously as he is now preparing for the opening game of the World Cup between Russia and Saudi Arabia, and had a foolscap file in front of him containing assorted facts about the players.There was a goalmouth melee, which saw both the Carshalton goalkeeper and the Telford player red-carded. And a penalty shootout after the much fancied Telford came back from 2-0 down only to blow it on the last kick of the game. “Now that is absolutely out of order,” said Tyldesley, as the hulking No 10 wrapped a menacing paw around the referee. “He’d have done well to keep his opinions to himself.” It’s advice he has tried to follow.But in a sense all of his commentary implies an opinion. Presumably he would have disapproved of Zinedine Zidane’s farewell headbutt on Marco Materazzi in 2006 and David Beckham’s retaliation on Diego Simeone that got him sent off in 1998. Tyldesley himself doesn’t get flustered. He is unflappable. He has – and admires – grace under pressure. “His control wasn’t the best,” as he said in one of his critical remarks about the U15 final. The ability to take and keep control is all important, whether you’re on the pitch or off it.This might have something to do with having been subjected to the furious “hairdryer” treatment from Sir Alex Ferguson when still manager of Manchester United, not just once but twice. “You really can feel your hair blowing backwards.” He thought that the boot that hit David Beckham in the face in the dressing room was “probably an accident”.Whether it’s broadcasting to schools or to 10 million people on ITV, Tyldesley always feels a sense of “responsibility”. “Balance” is a key word. He points out that the dying words of Pheidippedes, the messenger who ran all the way from Marathon to Athens to report on the outcome of the battle back in 490BC, “We won!”, only caused confusion, because people were bound to ask, “Who is ‘we’?” “He wasn’t a good journalist,” says Tyldesley. “What he should have said is ‘Athens won’.” Greece 1, Persia 0.He was once commentating on an England-Scotland game with Ron Atkinson when Atkinson insisted on saying “we”. Tyldesley said to him, “You should say ‘England’ not ‘we’.” Although he accepts that there perhaps he was being “correct beyond reason”. He allows that the occasional we “might slip out” at the World Cup. “I’m English but I’m still objective. You don’t choose to support England. It would be odd to switch to supporting Chile.”Tyldesley disapproves of those who get too fancy. “A straightforward pass would have done,” is a classic line of his, which happened to be addressed to schools. So too when it comes to commentary. He argues that cricket and golf have passages of inaction which permit – or even demand – “colour”, the kind of lyrical and expansive discourse, infinitely digressive, forever associated with John Arlott and Brian Johnston in cricket or Peter Alliss in golf. Steve Bunce likewise in boxing, and I can get similarly carried away when it comes to describing surfing, perhaps because there are often long lulls between the epic and the awesome.Tyldesley is more a fan of plain speaking. He says the best ad slogan of all time is Ronseal’s “Does exactly what it says on the tin”. That’s how he thinks commentary should be. You observe, you analyse, you try not to hype it up. You keep it “succinct”. “There’s no point trying to be Wordsworth or Browning. As Barry Davis once said, “One man’s commentator is another man’s pain in the arse.”Everything is mediated and mediatised. There are no exceptions. The old Zen koan, “If a tree fell over in the forest and no one was there to witness it would you still hear it?” now has a clear answer. Yes, because it would be captured by a passing drone or on satellite TV, blazed all over Instagram, tweeted about furiously, the tree’s friends on Facebook would start a crowdfunding campaign, and it would shortly thereafter be the subject of a controversial Channel 4 documentary. Nothing happens any more without commentary. But this is and always has been especially true of football. “They think it’s all over… it is now”, Kenneth Wolstenholme’s line, is as memorable as the 1966 World Cup final itself. Whether or not the ball crossed the line is less significant now than the fact that there was so much debate about whether or not it had. And new technology is not making the debate go away, rather the opposite.I can’t play football without also hearing something like this in my head:\u0026nbsp “Martin comes on, scores with his first touch, and the crowd goes wild.” As Simon Critchley, philosopher and (currently distraught) Liverpool fan comments in his book, What We Think About When We Think About Football, “We usually know football through commentary, through largely, and hugely, inane commentary.”Tyldesley doesn’t think of it as inane. “Sometimes,” he says, “‘a game of two halves’ is exactly what it is. You can’t improve on it.” If he were to write a book about it, it would be something like the opposite of Nick Hornby’s Fever Pitch. Hornby is all about irrational fandom, ritual, intensity of feeling. Tyldesley is more of a phlegmatic “keep calm and carry on” sort of guy. “We don’t need to see that!” he exclaimed at the sight of an overflow of emotions on the sidelines with even teachers getting hot under the collar.Albert Camus said, “I learned everything I know about morality from football.” Which is to say, when it comes to the “beautiful game”, the good, the bad, and the ugly are all on display. There are undoubtedly heroes and villains in Tyldesley’s narrative. But he does it subtly. “You try not to sound too much like a Methodist preacher,” as he puts it. When it comes to making criticism of the play – you could call it a judo throw – by Sergio Ramos, the Real Madrid captain, that resulted in Mo Salah going off in agony with a dislocated shoulder, Tyldesley is judicious but still uncompromising in his remarks. There is “a coming together with Ramos that only he can fully explain”. As he goes up to collect the cup, Ramos is described as “not everyone’s idea of a model professional – maybe nobody’s”.There is even an implicit politics in his commentary. Tyldesley has no objection to big money in football. “It’s labour intensive, they’re entitled to be paid. You can’t do without inidual players.” But still “the collective should be stronger than the inidual”. And this is where we went so badly wrong in the Brexit campaign, and the adjacent media coverage, he argues. “We turned it into a personality competition. Instead of providing the relevant information, we focused on the impact it would have on the lives of politicians.”He says that “the most popular team in this country is not Manchester United or Liverpool, it’s England.

He would never use the word “esoteric” for example, he says, because he doesn’t “want anyone to have to get up and look for a dictionary”.When I saw him, Tyldesley was prepping Arabic and Russian names. He says, “I will try to get it correct, but I will not make sounds we don’t make in the English language.” When identifying James Rodriguez of Chile in the past, he wanted to say “James”.\u0026nbspEventually he bowed to pressure from Twitter to say “Ham-es”, in the Spanish manner. “But later I learned that his father,\u0026nbspa 007 fan,\u0026nbsphad named him after James Bond.”\u0026nbspHe felt vindicated, because in Spanish-speaking countries it’s always James, never Ham-es, Bond.\u0026nbspHe is not, he reckons, “responsible for the teaching of Spanish” or Arabic or Russian.In an extremist, Dionysian world, Tyldesley is an Apollonian voice of reason.

A new AI algorithm exposed to the most macabre corners of the internet demonstrates how we could arrive at the darker version of the late physicist’s prophecy.Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)\u0026nbsptrained its ‘Norman’ AI – named after the lead character in Alfred Hitchcock’s 1960 film Psycho – on image captions taken from a community on Reddit that is notorious for sharing graphic depictions of death.Once there, Norman was presented with a series of psychological tests in the form of Rorschach inkblots. The result, according to the researchers, was the “world’s first psychopath AI”.\u0026nbspWhere a standard AI saw “a black and white photo of a baseball glove”, Norman saw “man is murdered by machine gun in broad daylight”.The idea of artificial intelligence gone awry is one of the oldest tropes of dystopian science fiction. But the emergence of advanced AI in recent years has led to scientists, entrepreneurs and academics increasingly warning of the legitimate threat posed by such technology.Billionaire polymath Elon Musk – who founded the non-profit AI research company OpenAI – said in 2014 that AI is “potentially more dangerous than nukes”, while Hawking repeatedly warned of the dangers surrounding the development of artificial intelligence. Less than six months before his death, the world-renowned physicist went as far as to claim that AI could replace humans altogether if its development is taken too far. “If people design computer viruses, someone will design AI that improves and replicates itself,” Hawking said in an interview last year. “This will be a new form of life that outperforms humans.”But Norman wasn’t developed simply to play into fears of a rogue AI wiping out humanity. The way it was trained on a specific data set highlights one of the biggest issues that current AI algorithms are facing – the problem of bias.Microsoft’s Tay chatbot is one of the best demonstrations of how an algorithm’s decisionmaking and worldview can be shaped by the information it has access to. The “playful” bot was released on Twitter in 2016, but within 24 hours it had turned into one of the internet’s ugliest experiments.Tay’s early tweets of how “humans are super cool” soon descended into outbursts that included: “Hitler was right, I hate the jews.” This dramatic shift reflected the interactions Tay experienced with of a group of Twitter users intent on corrupting the chatbot and turning Microsoft’s AI demonstration into a public relations disaster. AI bias can also have much deeper real-world implications, as discovered in a 2016 report that found a machine-learning algorithm used by a US court for risk assessment was wrongly labelling black prisoners as more likely to reoffend.It is hoped that even Norman’s deeply disturbed disposition can be softened through exposure to a broader range of inputs. Visitors to the website are encouraged to fill in their own responses to the Rorschach tests, with the researchers imploring: “Help Norman to fix himself.”The Independent\u0027s bitcoin group on Facebook is the best place to follow the latest discussions and developments in cryptocurrency.

His grandmother died when he was 10 and his mother followed six years later.Kolisi\u0027s potential at rugby emerged when he was awarded a place at a public school thanks to an outreach programme helping students from disadvantaged communities.According to his boarding master at Grey High School, he could not speak a word of English but had something special.He represented his school and went on to play for Eastern Province, the Cape Town Stormers and the national under-20s side before winning his first cap in 2013.Along the way he battled - like many others - against the assumption he was only earning his place because of the “quota” system which aims to make sure black players make up half of the Springbok team by the 2019 World Cup.The decline in fortunes of the national team, and a recent run of bad results against Wales and Ireland, have led to calls for the quota to be dropped.Nobody, however, has suggested that Kolisi was not in the team on merit.Kolisi is inspiring more black players to take up the historically white-dominated sport (PA)His appointment as captain by new coach Rassie Erasmus for the first Test against England was hailed as a landmark moment for a sport still haunted by its links to Apartheid.Kolisi walked out on to Ellis Park on Saturday wearing the same number six jersey worn by Francois Pienaar and Nelson Mandela.With the thrilling 42-39 victory over England, he is now inspiring more black players to take up the historically white-dominated sport and continue the work of Nelson Mandela.I don\u0027t see rugby as a job, I love doing what I do and I want to inspire as many people as I can especially those from the same background as me, Kolisi has told Rugby World.It\u0027s vital people are an example for younger kids, show them how you can make it in South Africa so they don\u0027t have to look elsewhere for role models, to America or other countries.No matter where you come from, if you put hard work in you can achieve. Kids in South Africa hopefully see people like me make it and give back to less fortunate people.”The former Springbok winger Bryan Habana told the BBC: It\u0027s a monumental moment for South African rugby, and a moment in South African history.From where Siya has come from … his humble beginnings, having worked unbelievably hard to get to this moment - it\u0027s absolutely fantastic.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

However,\u0026nbsparchaeologists\u0026nbspare\u0026nbspunsure about who it is supposed to represent.Due to the crown researchers assume the man is some member of royalty, but are unsure who he is or even what kingdom he would have ruled over.This location is very important because it suggests that the site may have shifted hands between these polities, more likely between\u0026nbspAram-Damascus\u0026nbspand Israel,\u0026nbspHebrew University archaeologist Naama Yahalom-Mack\u0026nbsptold , adding that\u0026nbspthe sculpture has a very interesting hairdo, which is similar to the way ancient Egyptians depicted Near Eastern peoples in their art.After being found by a volunteer digging at the site, curators at the Israel Museum made the uncommon move to put the piece on display almost immediately.Eran Arie, the museum’s curator of iron age and Persian archaeology, said of the discovery:\u0026nbsp“In the iron age, if there’s any figurative art, and there largely isn’t, it’s of very low quality. And this is of exquisite quality.”Ms\u0026nbspYahalom-Mack\u0026nbspmade some educated guesses as to who the man is, suggesting it could be either Ahab or Jehu of Israel, Ithobaal or Hazael of Damascus, or even\u0026nbspBen\u0026nbspHadad.However she was quick to point out that we\u0027re only guessing here.As the sculpture is only a head, archaeologists now plan to continue digging in the site to see if it was part of a larger piece.The archaeology\u0026nbspcommunity made another incredible discovery this week when\u0026nbspresearchers in China found the oldest\u0026nbspfootprints on Earth in the\u0026nbspYangtze Gorges which they believe are 550 million years old.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

If he fires at us, we will destroy his forces\u0027​Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has threatened to carry out direct military strikes targeting President Bashar al-Assad’s regime unless all Iranian forces are withdrawn from Syria.\u0026nbspThe aggressive ultimatum to Damascus is a significant escalation in the confrontation in Syria between Israel and Iran.The Syrian leader was “no longer immune, his regime is no longer immune. If he fires at us, we will destroy his forces,”\u0026nbspMr Netanyahu declared during a visit to London, speaking at a question and answer session at the Policy Exchange think tank.Israel has carried out a number of air strikes on Iranian bases in Syria and has repeatedly demanded that Iran, which it considers “an existential threat”, must remove its forces and weapons from Syria.But this was the first time that it had been stated that the Assad regime would be punished for the presence of Iranian forces, which have been fighting Isis\u0026nbspand Islamist rebels.Mr Netanyahu said: “I think there is a new calculus that has to take place and Syria has to understand that Israel will not tolerate the Iranian military entrenchment in Syria against Israel.“The consequences are not merely to the Iranian forces there but to the Assad regime as well, I think it’s something that he should consider very seriously.”The Israeli prime minister blamed Assad personally for the presence of Tehran’s forces in Syria as he warned of possible Israeli intervention.“Assad has to consider this: when they waged this horrific civil war, Israel did not intervene. Now the war is nearly over, he invites Iran in to entrench itself?” \u0026nbspThe Syrian leader was accused of facilitating Tehran “to move its army a thousand miles so it can threaten Israel. They want to bring in precision guided rockets with half a ton warheads and submarines to the Mediterranean… Iran does not believe in a master race, it believes in a master faith,” and is bent on conquest, Mr Netanyahu charged.The prime minister is on a tour of Western Europe to try to drum up support for further action against Iran, after US President Donald Trump reneged on an agreement between international powers and Tehran over its nuclear programme.The other signatories to the deal – Britain, France, Germany, Russia and China – as well as the United Nations have all stressed that it was working and the Iranian government was abiding by its commitment.Emmanuel Macron, Angela Merkel and Theresa May have told Mr Netanyahu that they are\u0026nbspdetermined not to abandon the agreement, the scrapping of which could lead to nuclear proliferation in the region and beyond, they warned.That, he boasted, had been effectively destroyed by him and Mr Trump.He warned European businesses of the punitive fines they would face under American sanctions if they continued trading with Iran.Mr Netanyahu stated that his aim on the trip, instead, was to “expose” how “Iran is devouring one nation after another” and ask Western European governments to do more “about reversing Iran’s aggression in the region and getting them out of Syria”.The French, German and British leaders have all raised their concerns with Mr Netanyahu about the recent brutal violence at the Gaza border in which dozens of Palestinians were shot dead by Israeli troops.The UK foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, urged the Israeli government to open an independent inquiry into the deaths and injuries suffered during the protests.Asked at the London meeting why non-lethal methods, such as water cannons and rubber bullets, were not used, or even a policy of shooting at legs, rather than shoot to kill, not pursued, Mr Netanyahu insisted: “We have tried all these methods, they don’t work. These were not non-violent protests, quite the contrary.“We are doing everything we can to both minimise casualties and, at the same time, protect Israeli lives.”Referring to Israel’s success in technological innovations, Mr Netanyahu added “given our record, we probably will figure something out, but we haven’t got there yet. The last thing we want is violence or confrontation.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The remainder were undecided.And those aged under 45 showed an even higher level of support for a united Ireland. Those aged 18-45 were 49 percent in favour of a united Ireland, 38 percent in favour of remaining in the UK and 13 percent undecided.Brexit could lead to a united Ireland with support growingThe number of Northern Irish citizens in favour of a united Ireland appears far higher than a poll released last month, which saw the same proposal receive just 21 per cent support.However May\u0026rsquos Ipsos Mori poll was conducted face-to-face while the Lucid Talk poll was conducted online and over the phone, with pollsters believing this could help better represent the \u0026ldquoshy united Ireland voters.The BBC commissioned the most recent LucidTalk poll of 1,686 people, who were interviewed between May 4 and May 10.Support was even higher in Belfast, where a majority of 50.2 per cent said they would support a united Ireland - an \u0026ldquoincredible showing given the city\u0027s history, one expert said.Northern Irish political commentator David McCann said the result in Belfast was particularly notable given it hosted the signing of the Ulster Covenant- a document signed by 500,000 people in 1912 in protest at the growing autonomy from Britain given to\u0026nbspIreland. Many signed using their own blood with the creation of the unionist militia the Ulster Volunteers following three months later.Mr McCann of current affairs website Slugger O\u0026rsquoToole tweeted: \u0026ldquoA majority of Belfast would support a UI in the city of the Ulster Covenant. Incredible showing.Support for a united Ireland has surged since the June 2016 Brexit voteMore than a quarter of respondents said they had recently changed their mind in favour of a united Ireland due to Brexit. Ironically the ultra-unionist DUP were the only major political party in Northern Ireland to campaign in favour of Brexit.Twenty-eight percent of respondents said they \u0026ldquoused to support NI staying in the UK but I would now support NI joining the ROI in response to a question on whether Brexit had changed their mind.This could be attributed to the ongoing chaos over the future of the Irish border and the fact Northern Irish citizens voted by a hefty majority of 56 percent to remain in the EU, despite the UK as a whole narrowly voting to leave.\u0026nbspIt comes as Irish taoiseach (prime minister) Leo Varadkar travelled across the border for an historic visit to the Orange Order HQ - the first such visit by a ruling leader of the Republic.Mr Varadkar said he was a \u0026ldquoneighbour not an invader as he spoke outside the Grand Lodge, which is the base for the pro-union and pro-Protestant order.Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland could unite as support for a border poll growsThe taoiseach visited a memorial to Orange Order members killed during the Troubles and was welcomed by the Grand Master of Ireland Edward Stevenson.Mr Stevenson said: \u0026ldquoWe acknowledge this is a significant moment as it is the first time a serving leader of the Republic of Ireland government has visited the headquarters of the Grand Orange Lodge of Ireland.\u0026ldquoAs a cross-border organisation, we welcome the Taoiseach\u0026rsquos direct engagement with our members based in the border counties of the Republic and in so doing, recognising the longstanding cultural identity of the Orange family in the south.\u0026ldquoIt is also important to acknowledge the importance of the Taoiseach paying his respects to those members of our Institution, many of whom served in the security forces, who were murdered by terrorists.\u0026ldquoSuch a gesture should not be underestimated and will, I believe, be deeply appreciated by many relatives of the deceased, and the Orange membership as a whole."},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/139/590x/secondary/david-davis-brexit-resignation-1374897.jpg","title":"david davis brexit theresa may resignation pact","story":"The furious Brexit Secretary agreed with Steve Baker and Suella Braverman that should Mrs May go ahead with her plan to dodge a hard border with Northern Ireland, all three would quit on Thursday.Sources dubbed the atmosphere a \u0026ldquotinderbox and referring to the government, told the  \u0026ldquoit felt, for the first time, as if it could all have toppled.The pact was fuelled by Boris Johnson\u0026rsquos leaked remarks about wanting a more \u0026ldquomacho leadership on Brexit, which saw the Home Secretary lock horns with Mrs May when he told her to show more \u0026ldquoguts.Had Mr Davis, Mr Baker and Ms Braverman resigned, the result could have been one of Mrs May\u0026rsquos most vulnerable moments in power.Had Mr Davis, Mr Baker and Ms Braverman resigned, the result would have been catastrophic The furious Brexit Secretary agreed with Steve Baker and Suella Braverman to form a pactThe storm could not have come at a worse time for Mrs May.She has a matter of days to defeat 15 House of Lords amendments to the Bill after they suggested she keep the UK in the EU customs union.The result of which would shackle Britain to the bloc forever.Mrs May also infuriated Brexit-backers by giving her remain-supporting cabinet ministers the first glimpse of her revised plan for avoiding a hard border with Northern Ireland in an attempt to keep them on side.

It was love at first sight and they started to write to each other.Dashing, blond-haired, athletic 18-year-old Philip is said to have caught her eye as he entertained her by jumping over tennis nets.Elizabeth was just 21 and Philip, who had renounced his Greek royal title and become a naturalised British subject, was 26 when the pair became engaged. Prince Philip has shared 70 years of blissful marriage with the Queen  Prince Philip retired in August last year It has been suggested that they became unofficially engaged in summer 1946 while they were staying at Balmoral.Prince Philip joined the Navy from school in 1939 aged 18 and went on to serve with distinction in the Mediterranean.He also saw battle in the Second World War and many royal insiders tipped him to go all the way in the senior service and become its chief or First Sea Lord.But the Duke resigned as a commander in 1951 when it became clear his father-in-law King George VI was in ill health.He was formally made a British prince in 1957 by his wife, after he became the Baron Greenwich, Earl of Merioneth and Duke of Edinburgh just before his wedding to the Queen.Indeed, the Prince had to wait until his 90th birthday in 2011 before becoming the titular head of the Royal Navy.And it was then that the Queen appointed him to the symbolic title of Lord High Admiral, which dates back to the 14th century, as thanks for his lifetime of dedication and in recognition of how he had sacrificed his naval career.But after the death of his father-in-law, the Duke threw himself into royal life to overcome the disappointment of the premature loss of his professional career.And after more than 65 years by the side of his wife Queen Elizabeth II, Prince Philip has certainly made his mark on the British monarchy as the moderniser of the firm."},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/106/590x/Prince-Philip-pictures-Duke-of-Edinburgh-birthday-971354.jpg","title":"Prince Philip birthday Duke of Edinburgh birthday pictures","story":"The Queen\u0026rsquos husband Prince Philip turns 97 today.Queen Elizabeth II\u0026rsquos consort was born on June 10, 1921 in Greece.

And more people who lost out when they moved into temporary work will also receive a boost.Ms McVey said: This Government is committed to delivering a welfare system that supports claimants and is fair to taxpayers.Universal Credit is currently being rolled out across the country but has been hit by a string of delays and blunders."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NINTCHDBPICT0004114102511.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"brexit sell out david davis sun says","story":"The Government intends to offer the EU a “backstop” arrangement that could shackle us to its restrictive ­customs rules for ever to resolve the over-hyped Irish border issue.Brexit Secretary David Davis managed to get an end-date inserted, December 2021, but it was fudged as a mere “expectation”.

There have been times I’ve been in my car and I’ve - no one knows but you’re crying on your own.”Dedicating the award to Bradley, Defoe said: “I woke up this morning and I did think about Bradley. It was a special relationship.“There were times when I stood there and I thought ‘I don’t understand, what have I really done?’ Bradley is the one who’s suffered.”OBEs were handed to world heavyweight champion boxer Anthony Joshua and Britain’s most successful Winter Olympic athlete Lizzie Yarnold, who defended her skeleton title at the PyeongChang games earlier this year.The youngest award winner on the list is 20-year-old alpine skier Menna Fitzpatrick, Britain’s most successful winter paralympian, picking up an MBE - while her sighted guide Jennifer Kehoe was also rewarded.Former Welsh rugby player Dai Morris was given an MBE and 1988 Olympic gold medal winning hockey player Richard Leman was handed an OBE.Renowned opera singer Dame Kiri Te Kanawa was given the distinguished title of Companion of Honour.TV presenter Bamber Gascoigne, best known for being the original quizmaster on University Challenge, gets a CBE.Actress Fenella Fielding, 90, was awarded with an OBE. She was popular in the 1950s and 1960s and known as Englands first lady of the double entendre.Archers star Timothy Bentinck said he was astonished and humbled to be made an MBE.In the business sphere, Judy Naake, who made millions selling St Tropez self-tanning products - initially from the back of her car - receives an MBE for services to entrepreneurship, the community and philanthropy.Jo Malone, creator of the self-titled luxury perfumery brand who has since started the fragrance-centred Jo Loves business, is awarded a CBE for services to the British economy and the GREAT Britain campaign, which encourages people to visit and invest in the UK.Best-selling novelist Ken Follett said he was proud to be made a CBE for doing something I love.The spy thriller and historical fiction writer, 69, is made a CBE in the Queens Birthday Honours for services to literature and charity.Folletts novels include The Pillars Of The Earth, Eye Of The Needle, The Man From St Petersburg and Fall Of Giants.Tim Waterstone, founder of the high street bookstore, was given a knighthood.Veteran war journalist Kate Adie was handed a CBE.CHIEF Remain luvvie Emma Thompson was made a Dame in the Queen’s Birthday Honours list last night as a string of Europhiles were rewarded.The Remains of the Day actress sparked outrage during the EU referendum campaign by branding Britain “a cake-filled misery-laden grey old island”.Jacob Rees-Mogg MP said: “I hope it lifts a little of her misery when she contemplates the country she thinks is grey and, for some reason, cake-filled.”Other Brexit opponents honoured include historian Mary Beard, who was made a Dame, and novelist Kazuo Ishiguro who became a knight.ACTRESS Keira Knightley was handed an OBE last night — 15 years after scoring her breakthrough role.The star, who struck fame in 2002’s Bend It Like Beckham and moved on to hits like Love Actually, was ­honoured for services to drama and charity.She became the face of an Amnesty International hu­man rights campaign and has worked with Oxfam, Women’s Aid, WaterAid and Unicef.Keira, 33, nominated for Oscars for Pride \u0026amp Prejudice and The Imitation Game, was joined on the honours list by Tom Hardy.The actor, 40, received a CBE for services to drama.Veteran war journalist Kate Adie also got a CBE.RAPPER Ms Dynamite was recognised with an MBE for services to music in the Queen’s Birthday Honours List.The Mercury Prize-winning artist, born Niomi Arleen McLean-Daley, 37, burst onto the scene with earworm hit Dy-na-mi-tee, which featured on her debut album A Little Deeper.Her album won critical acclaim in the UK and US, and saw her win Brit Awards for Best British Urban Act and Best British Female Solo Artist in 2003.She returned to music in 2005 after the birth of her son with her second, politically-informed album Judgement Days featuring a plea to Tony Blair on the track called Mr Prime Minister.After winding down her music career, she has featured on television and in recent years appeared on Katy B’s Lights On track, as well as Magnetic Man’s Fire.In 2016, she was honoured with a Paving the Way MOBO award for her contribution to music as a female MC.THE honours system was dubbed “rewards for failure” last night after Network Rail boss Mark Carne got a gong despite the chaos on the railways.The £820,000-a-year chief exec, quitting this year, was given a CBE for his part in “modernisation of the rail infrastructure”.Even Network Rail chairman Sir Peter Hendy said the timing is “difficult” after the timetables failure of the last few weeks.Labour MP John Mann said: “This is one of the most extraordinary rewards for failure. Something is very wrong with the way we are currently running the country.”Fellow Labour MP Wes Streeting said it would “go down like a cup of sick” with commuters.Other gongs for failure include Canadian-born Royal Mail boss Moya Greene, who becomes a Dame despite overseeing its disastrous privatisation and a plunge in revenues.A Home Office immigration officer got an MBE despite the Windrush scandal and the 100,000 net immigration target being repeatedly missed.DWP official Karen Gosden got an OBE despite delays and errors with the rollout of the Government’s Universal Credit welfare reform scheme.And health quango Nice’s boss David Haslam was knighted despite refusing terminally ill NHS patients key drugs.BRITAIN’S longest-serving poppy seller is “over the moon” after being awarded an MBE.Rosemary Powell, 103, plans to hang up her collection box later this year after a remarkable 97 years collecting for the appeal as she is “getting old”.She first helped her mum Evelyn sell poppies aged six for the Royal British Legion’s first appeal in 1921.She lost two godfathers and three uncles during the First World War.Londoner Rosemary said last night: “It is very nice that I have been given this. I still vividly remember selling poppies on Richmond Bridge with my mother.”Her son Giles said: “The MBE is a tremendous reward for years of hard work and loyalty. Mum is absolutely over the moon. It’s great recognition for a lot of hard work.”During World War Two, Mrs Powell - now a great-grandmother — trained as a voluntary aid detachment nurse providing civilian nursing to the military.Her younger brother Peter a major in the Army, died in the conflict.She lived in Africa for a year in the 1950s and made poppies out of paper to give to locals during Remembrance.The brother of aid worker David Haines, who was beheaded by IS extremists, was also honoured.Mike Haines, 51, was awarded an OBE for his work in striving to reject terrorism. He set up the Global Acts of Unity project, which promotes peace and tolerance in schools across the country.He dedicated the honour to David, 44, murdered in 2014 after being taken hostage in Syria while working for a relief agency.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

This is not your fault. Ask Daddy!”Can you imagine how that little girl must be feeling?She’s lost her mother and some have surmised the note appears to point the finger at her dad.It’s obviously not at all clear if that was really Kate’s intention, or whether she just wanted her daughter to seek answers and comfort from her father.That’s the trouble with suicide. Those left behind have to deal with so many unanswered questions.Look at little Ariane, who has just lost her beloved dad and will also be left with feelings of confusion and anger, as well as searing grief.Anthony, 61, was an award-winning chef and TV presenter.He was in France filming an episode of his successful CNN series, Parts Unknown, when he was found unresponsive in his hotel room.He was a larger-than-life, passionate character who championed the underdog and supported his girlfriend Asia Argento, one of the first actresses to accuse Harvey Weinstein of rape.Both Kate and Anthony were successful and, as far as the rest of the world was concerned, were living the dream.But no one really knows what goes on behind closed doors.Kate, who was 55, met husband Andy 35 years ago.They were married for 24 years but had been living apart for the past ten months, while sharing parental duties.They hadn’t discussed divorce and Andy said they still loved each other very much.He went on to say there was no indication that Kate was going to kill herself and his priority now is to protect and comfort his daughter.He will not only be grieving but inevitably feel he should have been able to somehow prevent this tragedy.People have asked “Who in their right mind would leave their own child to grow up motherless?”, but that’s the point.Kate wasn’t “in her right mind” and it seems neither was Anthony.People who kill themselves are suffering mental distress that no one can understand unless they have walked a mile in their shoes.On the surface, Kate had it all. Many thought she was still happily married. The couple had a healthy daughter, her designer label was a massive success.Kate was also good looking, funny and always seemed happy in interviews and photos. But now we know the poor woman was in agony.According to members of her family she had suffered from mental health problems for many years, and there has been speculation she was reluctant to seek help.If this was the case, then the reasons put forward for Kate trying to cope on her own are heartbreaking.She was apparently worried that her business, based on her cheerful handbags, would be affected if it was known she suffered from anxiety and depression. That really is desperately sad.Not only was Kate trying to cope with her demons but her marriage was going through a rocky patch and all the while she felt as though she had to paint on a smile and pretend everything was fine.Her life became so unbearable that she believed her only escape was to end it all.Her husband has said she was undergoing treatment and taking medication, yet Kate’s death shows that despite a change in attitudes towards those unfortunate enough to suffer from mental health problems, there is still a very long way to go.There are still people who will tell sufferers who are clearly very unwell to man up, or pull themselves together, which is just about the worst thing you could do.Suicide is a growing problem and each death is a tragedy. It is the biggest killer of men aged 20 to 49 in the UK. At least 84 men will have taken their own lives this week.If so many people were being lost to a virus there would be a national outcry and funds would be made available to find the cause and cure.Mental illness is still a Cinderella disease, and that cannot continue.But there are glimmers of hope.On TV we’ve seen the effect of Aidan Connor’s suicide on his friends and family in Coronation Street. It was tough to watch but raised awareness on a massive scale.We have seen raw grief but also deep anger and Aidan was branded selfish by his distraught sister.Those closest to him have experienced guilt because they didn’t realise how much pain he was in and have suffered sleepless nights and have been torturing themselves for not knowing how bad it was and for not offering help.Corrie shone a light in a dark place and I believe this storyline and the tragedy of Kate Spade and the apparent suicide of Anthony Bourdain will make people think.None of us knows what private battles are being fought against the dark demons of mental illness, even among our family and close friends.We all need to be watchful and unafraid to ask if everything really is OK. We need to be prepared to be rebuffed but to gently persist if we feel there is a real problem.The black despair that it seems Anthony Bourdain and Kate Spade succumbed to could happen to any one of us.If you feel depressed, please, I beg you, be brave and ask for help. And let’s all be prepared to reach out to that person in despair.I FIND it utterly ludicrous that in the eyes of the law a criminal who steals your pet is treated in exactly the same way as if they stole your TV or sofa.There’s no consideration for the fact that your dog or cat is a living, breathing animal and a much beloved member of the family.If the thieves are caught, although unlikely in these days of police cuts, the monetary value of the pet is the only consideration when it comes to sentencing.This is bonkers. You simply cannot put a price on your pet.So I am delighted that a campaign to change the law is gaining momentum.What all concerned dog and cat lovers want is higher sentencing for the theft of our animals and to reclassify stealing a pet as a crime in its own right.Hopefully this would act as a deterrent to pet theft, something alarmingly on the increase.One of those who passionately wants the law to change is Sir Bruce Forsyth’s daughter Debbie Matthews.Back in 2006, both her dogs were stolen from her car.She appeared on GMTV with her dad to make a heartfelt plea begging for the return of Yorkshire terriers Gizmo and Widget.Thankfully, within hours of appearing on the show, people who had bought the dogs in good faith at a market realised they were stolen from Debbie and she was emotionally reunited with them.It was a traumatic time for the whole family and Debbie knows she was incredibly lucky her story had a happy ending.So many owners never see their pets again and are left with endless worries about their fate.If you want to help change the law, do sign the pet theft petition at petition.parliament.uk/petitions/212174 and make your voice heard.IT was impossible to take the p*** out of Peter Stringfellow, because he would be first to make fun of himself.He knew his habit of wearing tiny thongs made him look daft, and was well aware that his mullet haircut was old-fashioned and silly and that people considered him to be a bit naff.When he was pilloried, he just gave one of his big guffaws and carried on enjoying himself.Peter was funny, kind-hearted and generous to a fault.He bore his illness with great stoicism and bravery and will be sadly missed.POLDARK returns to our screens tomorrow night amid a row over what many in Scotland refer to as “taps aff”.This occurs on those wonderful, albeit rare, occasions when the sunshine beams warmly north of the border and allows chaps to remove their cagoules, sweatshirts, woolly jumpers and tops.Aidan Turner, who plays Captain Poldark, is probably one of the most famous exponents of “taps aff” in recent times, ever since those sweaty scything scenes in his first series.It turns out that it was Aidan’s idea to take off his cambric shirt and scythe away in those tight breeches.But it’s caused the mother of all rows, with admiring women being accused of “objectifying” the bold captain.I have thoughtfully reproduced an image of a topless Aidan so you can make up your own minds.You will either think this photograph adds to the joy of a Saturday or be horrified by the sexualisation of the poor, unfortunate man.Frankly, I’m happy to wallow in this fantastic view and look forward to tomorrow, BBC1, 9pm, when I can enjoy some cracking writing, proper acting and top production values.Those “taps aff” scenes only enhance the pleasure of Poldark and, don’t forget, no one forced Aidan to show his pert nipples.He knows full well he’s a handsome fella and it was all his choice, for which we are truly grateful.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I seriously don’t have a clue”.Once it was explained that Brexit meant Britain leaving the EU, the 21 year-old from Liverpool then went on to inexplicably ask: “Does that mean we won’t have any trees?”Downing Street aides revealed the PM’s two favourite TV programmes are Homeland and the 10 O’Clock News.Mrs May and husband Philip are currently captivated by the most recent season of the US drama about ex-CIA agent Carrie Mathison.Mirroring modern day reality, Carrie tries to save the US from chaos sewn by Russian fake news attacks.GOT a story?

I believe the horrifying murder of soldier Lee Rigby in May 2013 was a turning point.As the founder of Tell MAMA, I found myself in the unenviable position of having to mobilise my tiny team at the time to help the growing number of people being targeted at a street and online level by anti-Muslim hatred.The backlash was significant, given the targeting of a young soldier minding his own business and the brutal manner of the terrorist attack.In the aftermath, Ukrainian neo-Nazi Pavlo Lapshyn placed three bombs in mosques in Wolverhampton, Walsall and Tipton — two months after murdering Mohammed Saleem, a grandfather walking back home from his mosque in Birmingham.The past five years have seen no let-up in the UK.People acting alone and small insular cells of men, and increasingly women, have carried out attacks at London Bridge, in Manchester, Finsbury Park and Westminster Bridge.And let us not ­forget the multiple terrorist attacks on 7/7 and the attempted attacks on civilians on 21/7.Our country has had its fair share of local and national triggers for potential tensions, but the unique nature of British society has meant we have not seen riots on our streets, such as those in Oldham in 2001 — and this is something to be ­celebrated.Terrorist trigger points have clearly led to rises in anti-Muslim hate incidents and there have been points where our country has been under ­significant pressure.After 7/7 and the significant loss of life that took place then, Britain was on a heightened state of alert as another plot failed to deliver its deadly cargo and the police and security services were in a race to find members of that terror cell.Dubbed 21/7, the country was shaken, ­communities were fearful and there was a crackle in the air as some people aired their frustrations openly.Even after all of this, we as communities held together.There is therefore something unique in our country which means community violence has not broken out, whereas in other European ­countries there have been street clashes and the widespread intimidation of minority communities.That “uniqueness” in our country is based on the old tradition that is ingrained in our society — that of “live and let live”, and “fair play”.It also underscores that the space for the accommodation of ideas and new populations has been a fundamental and historic part of our country though today, with resource pressures, there are limits.However, this is not only one-way traffic, and a sense of pride and identity within groups such as Britain’s Muslims has shown itself time and time again.It is therefore important to note that while ­younger citizens are less proud to be English, poll after poll has shown that Muslims living here are more ­patriotic than the average Brit.This means many Muslims do feel pride in a country where they can worship freely, be who they want to be and have the ability to practice their faith how they want to.We also have to say what is patently obvious, that Muslims have more freedoms in the United Kingdom compared to their counterparts in ­mainland Europe, where veil bans, harassment and chronic unemployment blight Muslim and other minority communities.It is this freedom to worship without fear, allied to the British sense of fair play, that makes us a place many countries look up to.The fact is our futures are inter-related and will continue to be as people travel more and ­connect through social media.It also means many of our preconceptions of different communities will change over time.This can be a force for good, though hand-in-hand with this must be that there are a unique set of values in our country.They have held us together in the darkest moments and have strengthened our resolve to stand together. Of this, we can always be proud.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But your photo could end up alongside an article promoting things you would rather not be associated with - from bestiality to having a fetish for old, obese men. Now models are sharing cautionary tales of how their seemingly innocent photos ended up in the wrong hands.  A Twitter thread went viral this week after two stock models discovered they were being linked to unexpected campaigns.  Marley Bennett was horrified to see his face being used as a warning to male smokers that their addictive habit could lead to impotence. He tweeted: With the benefit of hindsight, accepting this job was definitely a mistake.  His hilarious reaction sparked a response from Yair Kivaiko, who was surprised to see his photo on an article about bestiality. He replied to Marley\u0027s tweet with: I hear ya. This is me.  The 36-year-old product manager told Sun Online: It was just a photo I\u0027d taken for fun with my parents\u0027 dogs in their back yard about four or five years ago and I decided to sell it via an app online to make some extra cash.  I was mortified when I saw it on an article about bestiality. It took me a really long time to tell my friends and family what had happened. I would never want to be recognised as that guy by people that had read the article. However, Yair still does not regret selling the photo. He added: I love the picture and enjoy seeing it from time-to-time on other ads.   I could have done without the bestiality story, but it was a minor website and luckily the article is no longer available online today so there\u0027s no real harm done. I wasn\u0027t sure how to react at first, but today I look at it as a funny turn of events and laugh about it. Other people\u0027s stock photos have also randomly turned up on expected articles. Samantha Ovens\u0027 modelling shots were originally taken for a campaign on cold and flu medication. However, Samantha, who is gay, was out with her friends when she noticed her face had been used on an article in the \u0027s anonymous sex cloumn. The article was titled: I fantasise about group sex with old, obese men. The piece, written in first person, explained how a 31-year-old woman struggled with fantasies about being “passed around” by fat, ugly old men.

But not this time, as Donald Trump raged against fellow leaders and tore apart a crucial deal hours after it was signed. Things had already got off on the wrong foot as leaders confronted the US President over tariffs at the meeting in Canada. And Trump trumped them all - clashing angrily with his allies, snubbing Theresa May and leaving the whole thing early. Here are the five biggest things we learned from the G7 summit.  Leaders failed in their bid to end US tariffs of 10% on aluminium and 25% on steel. UK Prime Minister Theresa May warned revenge was unavoidable over the tax on metal imports - worth \u0026pound389million from Britain to the US last year. A fragile consensus had been reached between the US and the other six G7 nation: the UK, Canada, Japan, Germany, France and Italy. But Donald Trump announced he was backing out of the deal and said he might double down on import tariffs by hitting the car industry. Despite Theresa May trying to stop a trade war, one could be looming after Canada\u0027s PM Justin Trudeau signalled retaliation and said: We will not be pushed around. British Deputy PM David Lidington warned: I don\u0027t think a trade war does anybody any good. The lessons of trade wars in the past are that everybody loses.  He\u0027s a TV star first and President second. And billionaire Donald Trump just couldn\u0027t help being the centre of attention. The mood was captured perfectly in a viral photo of grumpy German Chancellor Angela Merkel, locked in a gaze with the arms-folded President. As the photo shows, it was Trump against the world. He arrived late and left early in a blaze of warnings on Twitter.   Later he broke the usual carefully-crafted G7 diplomacy by sensationally backing out of a joint communique and branding Justin Trudeau dishonest and weak.  In a series of bombshell tweets after leaving early, the President slammed his Canadian counterpart\u0027s false statements and hinted at new car tariffs.  Trump snubbed Theresa May twice - first by not meeting with the UK leader, then by failing to name-check her in his closing press conference. Yet the Prime Minister launched an extraordinary defence of her US counterpart. She refused to say she liked working with him and admitted there had been frank discussions. But she insisted: We have a very good relationship with President Trump. We work with President Trump and the UK has very good relations with the United States. He left this summit early because he\u0027s going to Singapore to sit down with Kim Jong-un and discuss the denuclearisation of North Korea. That is in the interests not just of North Korea and South Korea, and countries in the region there, it\u0027s actually in the interests of all of the countries across the world.  It\u0027s four years since Russia was booted out of the G8 and it became the G7. But Vladimir Putin might as well have had a chair, given how much he featured. Britain devoted huge resources to try and persuade allies to crack down on the Kremlin with a rapid response unit, identifying cyber warfare and assassinations. But Donald Trump threw a spanner in the works by suggesting Russia should be readmitted to the G7. I think it would be an asset to have Russia back in, he said. I think it would be good for the world, I think it would be good for Russia, I think it would be good for the United States, I think it would be good for all the countries of the current G7, he said. Britain opposed the call. PM Theresa May said: They have to change their ways, they have to change the route that they are taking.

The prince was notably missing from the balcony at Buckingham Palace for the Trooping of the Colour parade on Saturday since retiring from public duties. But the nonagenarian was able to make it to his grandson Prince Harry\u0027s wedding to Meghan Merkle last month, just a few weeks after undergoing hip surgery. The prince is known for his colourful use of language at public events and his numerous gaffes have provided much delight over the years. Despite retiring last August, Philip managed to slip in a blunder when speaking to crowds at the Royal Family\u0027s Sandringham estate in Norfolk on New Year\u0027s Eve. He turned to his bodyguard and asked: Is that a terrorist? when he saw a man in the crowd with a big bushy ginger beard.

The Prime Minister faces a Commons showdown this Tuesday and Wednesday as MPs hold a string of crunch votes on her EU Withdrawal Bill . Leave-backing MPs are likely to vote on her side - to stop Britain staying in the EU-aligned EEA or customs union. But Brexiteers are also in despair at Mrs May\u0027s slow progress with Brussels, which dumped on her latest customs plan 24 hours after she sent it this week. One Tory told the Sun on Sunday all bets are off after the Bill has safely finished its journey through the Commons. And former party chairman Grant Shapps , who led a coup against Mrs May last year, today said there is only a 30% to 40% chance she will lead the Tories into the next general election in 2022.  It comes just as reports emerge that Theresa May could be forced into the greatest concession of all - immigration. According to the Sunday Times, a European ambassador has warned the EU will put free movement back on the table ahead of the Tory conference in October. This risks catching the PM at a moment of political weakness, coming just before she needs support ahead of MPs voting on her final Brexit plan. Reports today claim the EU could try and force Britain to accept continued freedom of movement - something Mrs May has repeatedly said is a red line. Days ago Brexit Secretary David Davis threatened to quit amid a Cabinet row about how to extend customs arrangements beyond 2020.  Mrs May managed to quell the revolt, by vowing to end her customs \u0027backstop\u0027 in December 2021, after a testy hour-long meeting with Mr Davis. But since then the EU has hit back, saying such a deal is not possible. Now a Tory source has told the Sunday Times: Last week was a dress rehearsal. Another said: She thinks she\u0027s won. She\u0027s f***** anyway. She\u0027s toast. The newspaper reported that Boris Johnson had been prepared to follow David Davis out the door this week if he had quit. A source said: There would have been at least one other cabinet level resignation, including a very big beast of exotic plumage. Another source said: It would have been bloody and brutal. He (DD) would have taken her over the cliff with him. Mr Shapps, speaking to Sky News\u0027 Sophie Ridge, said it seemed unlikely Mrs May will still be PM by the end of 2022.  He played down any prospect of an immediate challenge but demanded a quicker pace with “more decisions made, less waiting around for things”. In a sign of turmoil brewing in the party, two Theresa May-supporting MPs publicly spoke out today in a bid to stop colleagues moving against her. Remainer Amber Rudd and Brexiteer Iain Duncan Smith, both former ministers, warned any defeat of Mrs May could lead to the fall of the government and the rise of Jeremy Corbyn . In a joint article, they warn failing to back Mrs May would risk losing the precious chance to go on implementing policies that transform lives”. Veteran Tory ex-Chancellor Ken Clarke said MPs were holding Theresa May to ransom. He told the BBC they are undermining her and would seek to replace her if they weren\u0027t held up by two factors - that most Tories would still back Mrs May in a no confidence vote, and they can\u0027t decide on a successor. Housing Minister Dominic Raab demanded ministers unite behind the PM - branding Boris Johnson silly for claiming Donald Trump could do a better job of Brexit.  The ailing PM will bid to shore up her position with a crucial address to the backbench 1922 Committee tomorrow night. Despite the drama a poll has put the Tories on 44%, seven points ahead of Labour on 37%. Much of the rise in Tory support is down to a boost with working-class voters according to YouGov, which surveyed 1,619 British adults on June 4-5. The EU has a customs union. This means all 28 member states can trade with each other without any checks or duties on goods. Theresa May has said Britain will leave this after December 2020, so she can sign trade deals with non-EU countries. But officials have warned a new UK customs system won\u0027t be ready in time. So they\u0027ve devised a \u0027backstop\u0027 - a backup plan that will carry on some EU customs rules in the UK if there\u0027s no deal. It is designed to stop ports grinding to a halt and Northern Ireland setting up border posts, which could lead to violence. Yet Brexiteers were furious because it had no set end date. In a huge Tory row, they warned it would trap Britain half-in, half-out the EU. After frantic last-minute talks, and threats to quit by Brexit Secretary David Davis, a time limit was put in - December 2021. Yet the government only expects to follow that time limit. It is not legally binding. And the EU poured cold water on it. Britain and the EU also disagree about what the backstop will do. EU plans back in March would have kept Northern Ireland aligned with Brussels customs rules, but Theresa May rejected this because it draws a border between the province and the mainland. So she drew up Britain\u0027s own backstop, which is now being put to the EU for discussion. The UK plan is a temporary customs arrangement allowing totally tariff-free trade between the EU and the whole of the UK. So the UK would carry on being in the EU Customs Union in all but name until December 2021. But the UK also wants to sign new trade deals with nations outside the EU. Britain even wants to implement parts of these deals that don\u0027t relate to the backstop. Brussels has repeatedly said this won\u0027t be possible - so the new plan is setting up for a big battle with the EU. And as time ticks on, the backstop will become less of a Plan B and more of a Plan A. It\u0027ll turn from backstop... to frontstop."},{"url":null,"title":"theresa urged tosack foreign secretary","story":"NewsTheresa May urged to sack Boris Johnson as Foreign Secretary – by some of his OWN supportersWhile MPs who backed him in the 2016 Tory leadership contest agree with what he says, they take exception to his lack of ­statesmanship in saying it\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByNigel NelsonPolitical Editor20:33, 9 JUN 2018Updated20:36, 9 JUN 2018NewsIn his latest outburst, Boris Johnson was recorded at a private dinner last week saying the PM’s Brexit strategy lacked guts, and Donald Trump would do a better job (Image: Getty)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet politics updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailTheresa May is being urged to sack Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson – by some of his OWN supporters. While MPs who backed him in the 2016 Tory leadership contest agree with what he says, they take exception to his lack of \u0026shystatesmanship in saying it. In his latest outburst, Mr Johnson was recorded at a private dinner last week saying the PM’s Brexit strategy lacked guts, and Donald Trump would do a better job. He also \u0026shycriticised Chancellor Philip Hammond’s Treasury as “the heart of Remain”. Mr Johnson and Mrs May agree the UK must leave the EU customs union, which stops us doing trade deals with the rest of the world, and the single market, which allows unlimited EU migration.  But Mrs May is convinced a mutually beneficial deal can be struck with Europe. Mr Johnson is not so sure, and is more bullish about walking out of talks and into a no-deal hard Brexit.  He wants the PM to be more aggressive with our European  partners.

Twenty of us, crammed on a dinghy designed to take eight, not one of us a day over 30 and the youngest a six-year-old boy. The engine spluttered to a stop, and no matter how many times we pulled on the engine cord, it wouldn’t restart. As the wind picked up, the boat began to spin, and everyone cried out in panic. We realised one wrong move could drown us all. Europe was in sight ahead of us, tantalisingly close but still a few miles away. As the sun began to go down below the distant mountains, we threw our possessions overboard to lighten the load, saying silent goodbyes to the last things we had from home. We were alone at the mercy of the sea and we all knew how much danger we were in. At the forefront of my mind were the thousands of desperate people who’d died in this water: old women, mothers and their babies, strong young men… My older sister Sara and I slipped into the water in an attempt to stabilise the boat and pull it in the right direction, wrapping a thick rope around my wrist and pulling with all my might. Growing up in Damascus, Syria, my dad trained us to be strong swimmers from a young age, and we’d both competed at national level.   But this wasn’t like a pool, there was no bottom to it or sides to cling on to. The sea dragged and sucked at my clothes, the rope cut into my hands, and the waves slapped relentlessly in my face, stinging my eyes and burning my nose. But what choice did we have? It was starting to  get dark and no one else could swim very well.  Sara told me, ‘If anything happens, don’t try and wait for me, just go. Swim as fast as you can to shore.’  Every time I looked at the boat, the little boy Mustafa would be watching me – I pulled silly faces so that he wouldn’t feel afraid.   My mind kept wandering to what was beneath the surface of the water.  I knew there were no sharks in the Mediterranean, but what if one appeared? Every time I saw a carrier bag float past, I’d call out to Sara who was swimming beside me, scared it was something more.  Surviving the bombs  As a kid I hated swimming, and resented how hard my dad pushed me – but as I got older and began to win some competitions, I started to hate it less. Every moment I wasn’t at school, I was at the pool. So of course I was there when the bomb struck. I remember a crash and shattering windows, shards of glass hitting the water like bullets.  The coaches yelled for all the swimmers to get out of the pool, and we all scrambled out. As I looked back, I saw a ragged hole in the ceiling and, at the bottom of the pool, a metre-long rocket-powered grenade had landed in the water. By some miracle, it hadn’t exploded. We hid in the basement, listening to the sounds of missiles raining down on the streets above. Later, I learned that two men had been killed.  My mum told me it was too dangerous to carry on swimming after the bomb, but I refused. I was scared, of course, but this was just how life was now in my war-torn country. The sound of bombs became normal to us, and we got used to losing people – although it never got any easier. Once we sat in our basement listening to the crackle of gunfire in the street outside, growing dusty from falling plaster as shells fell in the street outside our front door. Not long after the bomb in the pool, many teenagers began to go to Europe alone. I wanted to feel like I had a future again, and I begged my dad to let us. At first he refused, but when some cousins began to prepare for the journey, he agreed. The journey begins In the summer of 2015, my sister, cousins and I flew to Beirut, and then to Turkey. It was a well-trodden path – there were thousands of Syrians fleeing alongside us. The people smugglers who helped us cross from Turkey to Greece treated us alright, but later, we realised that the inflatable boat had been slashed with a knife and poorly patched up. It’s hard to know what to think of these men: they send people to their death, but they also give people a chance to live. It took us three and a half hours to pull the boat to shore, but we made it. I felt euphoric for a few seconds, but then was hit by waves of thirst, hunger and exhaustion. We tried to buy water, but the shopkeepers refused to sell us anything because we were refugees, so we set off to walk for hours through the mountains without anything to drink.  All I had left in the world was a T-shirt and a pair of trousers. But along the way I met a kind girl who gave me some shoes, and dry clothes for Mustafa. There were kind people – even in Hungary, which is very anti-refugee, we found a taxi driver who drove like crazy to get us to the border. Eventually, after 25 days of travelling, we made it to our new home in Berlin. Six months later, the rest of our family were able to join us. They made the same journey and we were sick with worry, but somehow they made it too. I miss the food in Syria, but German people are kind and we feel safe at last. As soon as we arrived in Germany, I’d told a translator how much I love swimming and how I had competed in Syria. He put me in touch with a coach, and it wasn’t long before I was back in the water. I love being in the pool, with the safety of the four corners, but it will be a long time before I swim in the deep sea again. Making a new life  My coach put me forward for the Olympic Refugee team, and the day I found out I’d been chosen I couldn’t stop jumping up and down. Competing at Rio with nine other refugees from around the world was just incredible.  I was more happy than nervous – after that journey, I knew I could do anything. Before, it had been easy to feel shame whenever I heard the word refugee. But at Rio I had a whole different view. I’m now proud of being a refugee. My dream is to be in the top three at the Tokyo Olympics 2020. I don’t know which team I can swim for, though: I can’t swim for Syria, I’m not German, and the Refugee Team may not happen again. But I’m determined to be there. I’ll never forget the journey that got me here. Carrying memories of that time is like carrying a huge bag with rocks on your back. But you can’t get rid of them, because they made me who I am now.

But when Tami came to after being knocked out, it was clear fate could be every bit as cruel as the sea itself. Because while she had survived the catastrophic maelstrom – unconscious for 27 hours – her fianc\u0026eacute Richard was nowhere to be seen. His safety line trailing in the water behind the 44ft vessel told her she would never see her love again.  But for 23-year-old Tami, the devastation and loneliness that hit her then were just the start of a more incredible ordeal ahead. The boat, Hazana, was pitched to one side, its cabin filled with water. Furniture, debris and cans of food floated all around her. And she was 1,500 miles from land. The destruction wreaked by Hurricane Raymond had left Tami with an almost crippled vessel and virtually no equipment. With the engine lost, she made a sail from a broken pole and a storm jib, and set up a pump to keep the cabin from flooding. But luck did hand her one more chance to survive – not written in the stars, but in the sun.  Tami still had a working watch. And the experienced yachtswoman also had her precious sextant, a triangular device invented 250 years earlier to plot the angle of the sun in the sky. Used daily at noon, it let Tami calculate how far north of the equator she was – and bring her stricken boat in line with Hawaii, to stay on course to reach land. As her incredible story is told in a film released this month Tami, now 58, shows the triangular diamond pendant she wears constantly round her neck. “It reminds me of how I got home,” she says. “It saved my life.” Her ordeal began when Tami and English fianc\u0026eacute Richard Sharp agreed to sail a friend’s Trintella yacht from Tahiti to her native California. The 4,000 mile expedition ran into one of the biggest storms to hit the Pacific, a tropical cyclone brought on them by Hurricane Raymond. As wind and waves whipped up all around, Richard wrote in the yacht’s log: “Watch this one.”  They tried to escape its path. Tami later wrote a book about the tragedy, explaining: “This storm was rapidly turning into the worst conditions we’d ever experienced together. “We were terrified Raymond was catching us – but there wasn’t a damn thing we could do but sail and motor as fast and hard as possible. Finally I shouted to Richard, ‘Is this it? Can it get any worse?’ “No, hang on love, be my brave girl,” he told her. “Someday we’ll tell our grandchildren how we survived \u0026shyHurricane Raymond.” Terrified Tami shouted back to him: “If we survive.” Urging Tami to take refuge in the cabin, Richard strapped himself into the Hazana’s safety harness. Then everything went still, and above the roar of the wind and waves Tami heard Richard scream “Oh my God” as he was hurled overboard. It was the last thing she ever heard from her fianc\u0026eacute. Tami could not reach him before she was knocked out and “sailed into oblivion”.  But regaining consciousness more than a day later, she had no time to grieve. The mast was torn from its roots, the sail dragged in the water, and she was weeks from land with few rations. She spent the next 41 days alone, haunted by the loss of her love. She said: “There were times I didn’t want to live – I didn’t know how I was going to go on. The hardest part was Richard being gone.” At times she considered jumping overboard to join her fianc\u0026eacute. Once, she even put the yacht’s loaded rifle in her mouth. Tami admitted: “I really had to keep determined I wasn’t going to die.” In spite of the 1983 ordeal she remains a keen sailor, living on San Juan Island off the coast of Washington, US. She is often to be seen out on the water with her husband and two children. To help grapple with her torment, she wrote her memoir, Red Sky in Mourning: A True Story of Love, Loss, and Survival at Sea. It has been published in 15 countries and eight languages.

An undercover investigator found workers grabbing shut-eye after toiling for 60 hours a week in tough conditions. Some were said to be slumped at their benches on the assembly line while others kipped on chairs or foam sheets. And it was claimed workers – many hired on temporary contracts to get around labour laws – must get permission to take a loo break. Senior staff also told of being reduced to tears after being reprimanded. Workers’ rights group China Labor Watch said it found “illegal and unethical” conditions at the Foxconn factory where 8,000 work in Hengyang city.  Amazon struck a deal with Foxconn last year to ramp up production of the Echo, Echo Dot and Kindle devices. After learning of conditions at the Hengyang plant, Amazon vowed to act. It said suppliers were checked and problems at Hengyang had been identified. A spokesman said: “We take reported violations of our Supplier Code of Conduct extremely seriously. In the case of Hengyang, Amazon completed its most recent audit in March 2018 and identified two issues of concern. “We requested a corrective action plan from Foxconn and are committed to ensuring these issues are resolved.” The pledge came after an investigator who worked at the plant in Hunan province told the Mirror: “I saw many people were resting on the assembly line and sleeping. Others had pushed together chairs and were sleeping on those. Some even stacked foam boards and slept on top of them. They all looked exhausted.” The investigator’s duties involved cleaning 1,400 Echo Dot speakers in a day with a toothbrush dipped in rubbing alcohol to remove dust.  The woman added: “Workers sat on both side of the assembly line. One other worker and I were expected to wipe clean 2,800 speakers in a day.” In its report, the CLW said: “Workers must report to the line technician before using the bathroom during work hours. “A few senior workers were told off by the line leader for working too slowly. Some reported crying when reprimanded.” Life outside of the factory is also grim for many workers sleeping six to a room in houses provided by Foxconn nearby. Workers told of leaking roofs and unlit bathrooms.  The CLW claims thousands of staff are being hired as agency temps. They do not qualify for sick or holiday pay and can be laid off during slack periods. The investigator found 60-hour weeks were the norm in peak periods. Some staff did 80 hours overtime a month – way above the 36 hours legal maximum. A recent law change limits the number of agency staff to just 10 per cent of a company’s workforce. But the investigation found more than 40 per cent were from agencies. In November a Sunday Mirror \u0026shyinvestigation revealed workers at Amazon’s Tilbury warehouse in Essex were found asleep on their feet while working 55-hour weeks – and facing timed toilet breaks.

Yet this was no decorated military \u0026shyofficer feted for victories on the battlefield – but a heroine who fought and won a different kind of campaign. This was the solemn send-off for \u0026shysuffragette leader Emmeline Pankhurst, who died 90 years ago this week. Her death followed a bout of illness brought on by the stresses and strains of her long fight – the ultimate sacrifice for the cause she believed in. Her passing on June 14, 1928 at 69 was recognised as the loss of one of the \u0026shycentury’s most \u0026shyinfluential women.  The marches, \u0026shylectures, jail and \u0026shyhunger strikes for the Votes For Women movement had taken a massive toll on her health. Tragically she died only weeks before she was able to see all women over 21 get the vote. Only those over 30 had been enfranchised under the Representation of the People Act in 1918, which she and thousands of others fought for. In a further twist her funeral \u0026shyservice was held at St John’s Church in Smith Square – once the target of a suffragette bomb plot. Today Emmeline, who was buried in Brompton Cemetery and portrayed by Meryl Streep in the 2015 film Suffragette, is remembered as the inspirational figure who led women to make a mark on history.  And those who have followed in her footsteps remember her formidable character and enduring legacy. Her great-granddaughter Dr Helen Pankhurst, a women’s rights activist and author, said: “Footsteps is a good word for it. It \u0026shyconjures up images of all the marching that they did. “As soon as I think about Emmeline I think about her image as a public icon. “A single, visible symbol of women’s rights with the attributes of strength, charisma, perseverance and power.”  Born Emmeline Goulden in 1858 in Manchester, eldest of 10 children, she grew up in a politically charged family. Her parents were slavery \u0026shyabolitionists and supporters of female suffrage, taking Emmeline to her first meeting at 14. In 1878 she married Dr Richard Pankhurst, a lawyer who backed women’s suffrage and rights over property and money. After she had five children – Christabel, Sylvia, Adela, Harry and Frank, who died young – her husband encouraged her passion for the advancement of women.  She founded the Women’s Franchise League in 1889, which fought to allow married women to vote in local elections. Four years later she helped form the more militant Women’s Social and Political Union. The group had non-violent roots but later Emmeline advocated direct action and her resolve for “Deeds not Words” deepened. The WSPU gained notoriety as an army of women willing to bomb postboxes, burn down buildings and die for the cause. In 1913, member Emily Davison was killed when she stepped in front of the King’s horse at the Derby.  Helen, 53, a senior adviser to CARE International, said: “For me fundamentally Emmeline’s legacy is about women \u0026shydemanding power in traditional but also in new ways. “For women to be taken seriously sometimes they need to do battle in the way that men have. “They have to \u0026shyrefuse to be silenced and need a \u0026shywillingness to be militant. “But they must also use the fact that they are women to their advantage.” Like many suffragettes Emmeline was arrested repeatedly, once at the gates of Buckingham Palace in 1914, and went on hunger strike in Holloway Prison. She led marches under the suffragette colours of purple, white and green \u0026shyrepresenting loyalty, purity and hope.

Two mystery robbers held Dr Kailesh Solanki, 38, and his wife, Michelle, 30, at knifepoint , and forced them to hand over \u0026pound200,000 worth of cash, jewellery and handbags as their son, aged ten months, and 21-month-old daughter slept upstairs.   A manhunt has now been launched, with it revealed that the attackers smashed their way in through a patio window at the home of dentist Dr Solanki in Bowdon, Manchester Evening News reports .  They then grabbed Dr Solanki and dragged him through the broken glass.  He said: “I was in the kitchen sterilising bottles for my youngest. We’d just got both of the children to sleep and my wife was upstairs. She heard the sensors going off and shouted me.  “I ran up the stairs and that’s when we saw them on the CCTV . Two men wearing balaclavas – one had a hammer and the other a machete – and they were coming down the side of the property.”  Dr Solanki said several days earlier CCTV had captured what they believe are the same two men outside the house, but they fled after being disturbed by the security light. He added: “We were sure it was the same men, but this time they had come earlier. We rang the security company and the police, and they told us to try and scare them off by turning on the alarm. “I ran downstairs to try and turn it on and they saw me through the patio window. “I realised then that they wanted us to be in, they wanted one of us to be downstairs so they could take us hostage. “The next thing they smashed the patio windows and ran at me. “I froze. They grabbed me and dragged me through the broken glass which cut my feet, shouting at me to give them jewellery and taken off my watch, stuff like that.  “They threatened me, saying do it or they’d kill the kids. “My wife was at the top of the stairs, begging them to leave the children alone. She took off her bracelet and threw it to them. “One of them went and grabbed her and dragged her down the stairs, she was petrified, shaking, they made her take off her rings and other jewellery. “I was trying to open the safe, I just wanted to give them what they wanted so they’d leave. I remember trying to find the key and one of them raised the hammer at me, as if to say ‘hurry up’. “Our only saving grace at that point was that we knew the police and security company were on their way. “We gave them everything we could – jewellery, watches, handbags, a bit of cash – they ordered us upstairs and they ran.” Shortly afterwards, the security company arrived, and then the police, but the robbers were already long gone. “It was terrifying,” Dr Solanki added. “They were only in the house for five or six minutes, but it felt like a lifetime. “You just think they could have done so much worse than they did. “Incredibly the kids slept through it, which we are thankful for.” "},{"url":null,"title":"first picture three year old","story":"NewsFirst picture of three-year-old girl found dead at home as mum, 37, is arrested over deathLittle Amelia-Brooke Harris was found dead at a house on Friday night and police say they are treating her death as \"unexplained\" - while her mother Carly Harris, 37, is being quizzed\u0026nbspShareByMirror17:11, 9 JUN 2018Updated17:40, 9 JUN 2018NewsAmelia-Brooke Harris, 3, was found dead at her home (Image: WALES NEWS SERVICE)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA mother has been arrested after the mystery death of her own three-year-old daughter.

Her horrified parents tonight told how their daughter is in intensive \u0026shytherapy after \u0026shygetting hooked on the Fortnite game. The obsessed primary school pupil... - Secretly got up in the night and played until dawn. - Neglected to go to the toilet because she could not bear to leave the screen. - Hit her father in the face when he tried to confiscate her Xbox gaming console. - Dozed off in class because of her night-time addiction.  Experts fear she is one of many children at risk of developing mental health problems as a \u0026shyresult of over-exposure to the fight-to-the-death scenarios. Over 40 million have \u0026shydownloaded the so-called \u0026shysurvival shooter game since it was launched last July, sparking \u0026shyrecord numbers of digital addiction. The girl’s mum tonight said: “We had no idea, when we let her play the game, of the \u0026shyaddictive nature or the impact it could have on her mental health. She is in \u0026shytherapy for the addiction after she \u0026shybecame withdrawn, \u0026shyagitated and disturbed from playing up to ten hours a day – sometimes playing until dawn, wetting \u0026shyherself so she didn’t have to leave the screen. “This is a serious issue which is destroying our little girl’s life and someone needs to step in to ban it before it becomes an epidemic.” Fortnite has been endorsed by a multitude of top sport and music stars. The game’s most popular format is the Battle Royale in which 100 players fight each other until one is left standing. Although the game is free to download, its developers make money from hooked users who pay for in-game purchases to boost their performances.  Mum Carol, 36, said they bought their daughter an Xbox in January and shortly after she downloaded Fortnite. She and her husband Richard, who we are not picturing to protect the identity of their daughter, say it was not until mid-March they noticed \u0026shyworrying signs. Carol said: “We got called in by her head \u0026shyteacher asking if \u0026shyeverything was OK. She had fallen asleep twice in lessons and her grades were slipping. “When we asked our daughter what the \u0026shyproblem was, she became unusually \u0026shyargumentative and aggressive, which we just put down to her hormones.” But soon the sports-mad girl started saying she too tired to go to gym or ballet classes, as well as missing the family visits to church on Sunday mornings. Noticing small but regular payments on their credit card to Microsoft, adding up to over \u0026pound50 a month, they asked if she knew anything about this. The mum said: “Our daughter told us it could be some extras she’d paid for on Fortnite. “Of course we were furious and confiscated her Xbox. But then she lashed out and hit my husband in the face.” Despite limiting their daughter’s time on the game to one hour on school nights and two on weekends, they were still suspicious. Carol said: “My husband saw her light on in the night and found her sitting on a urine-soaked \u0026shycushion playing the game. “I found her backside was red-raw. She was so hooked to the game she wouldn’t even go to the toilet.” The next morning they sat her down and asked her to tell the truth.  The mum said: “Crying, she told us that every night for the past two months she had waited until we were asleep and then got up to play, sometimes until 5am. “We worked out that she could have been playing for up to ten hours a day, and we’d had no idea.” The parents contacted addictions counsellor Steve Pope, who agreed to see the girl for psychotherapy. Steve told the Sunday People: “Over the last two months I’ve been \u0026shycontacted by dozens of parents with children as young as eight showing signs of addiction to Fortnite. “I’ve been working in this field for three decades and never seen anything like it, how widespread and potentially damaging this is. “I know bright kids who will fail their exams this summer because of Fortnite, kids who are stealing from their parents and friends to pay for the extras, kids who urinate in bottles because they can’t bear to leave the game.” Experts claim it is the high-profile celebrity \u0026shyendorsements in recent weeks that have fuelled exposure. Steve added: “You see Premier League footballers celebrating goals with Fortnite dances and it’s the biggest possible advert for kids. “It’s the perfect gateway into \u0026shyaddiction and gambling.” Professional gamers are making up to \u0026pound500,000 a month from live-streaming their Fortnite games for addicted children to watch. The nine-year-old girl in our \u0026shyreport is slowly \u0026shygetting back on track with her sports and schooling. But her mum said: “I urge every parent out there to know what this game can do, how it sucks young children in and could ruin lives.” Culture Secretary Matt Hancock has warned that addictive online shooter games such as Fortnite have a damaging impact on children. 6 TIPS TO KEEP ’EM SAFE Gaming expert Andy Robertson of the online safety group Internet Matters offers six tips for parents on Fortnite: 1 Make sure it is age appropriate The Video Standards council rate Fortnite as PEGI 12 for mild violence. 2 Monitor who your child is talking to Check the communication settings on the game to ensure children aren’t talking to strangers. 3.

Prem stars boost craze Fortnite has gripped the footballing world – with players from Atletico Madrid to Cardiff City endorsing it. The list of top-flight players performing Fortnite dances as goal celebrations extends from Atletico’s Antoine Griezmann to England stars Dele Alli, Harry Kane and Kieran Trippier. Members of the England squad have openly bragged about their skills playing Fortnite. Alli, 22, boasted he is top of the Three Lions’ ranking. The Spurs midfielder, who did the game’s “floss dance” to celebrate an FA Cup semi-final goal last month, said: “I think that it’s a great way to relax and rest your body playing \u0026shyPlayStation. “I’d say I am the best \u0026shyFortnite player. I’ve won over 100 games. But a lot of the boys have just started playing it.  “We play in teams so it \u0026shydefinitely brings us together.” Cardiff defender Callum Paterson has made Fortnite celebrations his speciality. And France international Griezmann regularly performs the “Take The L”dance after a goal. In the Fortnite game the dances are performed to celebrate a killing an opponent. Other celebrity fans of the game include Argentinian aces Lionel Messi and Sergio Aguero. The obsession with Fortnite even extends to watching others play.  Last month an online video of Canadian rapper Drake playing Fortnite with pro-player Ninja was watched more than 600,000 times. Ninja – real name Tyler Blevins – reportedly makes nearly \u0026pound400,000 a month from live-streaming himself playing the game on Twitch, a live version of YouTube. Fortnite’s makers, Epic Games, have even announced a Fortnite Celebrity Pro-Am which will pair 50 celebrities and 50 pro players. Fear behind fun Internet Matters ambassador and psychologist Dr Linda Papadopoulos says: “Games can become quite addictive for children because they’re fun in the way that cartoons are fun. “A lot of apps or games act on the brain in the same way that an itch that needs to be scratched.

The new Duchess of Sussex, 36, wore her dark hair in loose ringlets as she joined Prince Harry at the traditional summer spectacle. Meghan experienced the pomp and pageantry of the event for the first time when she arrived on Horse Guards Parade with Harry in a carriage, along with the Queen\u0027s cousin the Duke of Kent. The couple were greeted by the sight of hundreds of Guardsmen in their scarlet tunics and bearskins lined up on the parade ground - Henry VIII\u0027s former jousting yard - as the event began. Harry, 33, did not travel on horseback alongside his brother William because he is not a Regimental Colonel. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex, who married three weeks today, travelled from Buckingham Palace along The Mall to cheers from royal fans gathered in the famous London thoroughfare. The Duchess of Cornwall and Duchess of Cambridge were in another carriage while a third carried Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie, the Countess of Wessex and her daughter Lady Louise.  The Duchess of Sussex wore a dress by Carolina Herrera and a hat by Philip Treacy, while Kate wore a dress by Alexander McQueen and a hat by Juliette Botterill. Camilla wore a pale blue silk dress and coat by Bruce Oldfield and a hat by Philip Treacy. Trooping the Colour is a ceremonial spectacle that brings together prestigious regiments and the families of the serving men and women in celebration of the monarch\u0027s official birthday. Stands lining Horse Guards were filled with the wives, girlfriends and parents of the servicemen who when not performing ceremonial duties are fighting soldiers.  Meghan, Harry and the other members of the royal family took their place in Wellington\u0027s former office which overlooks the parade ground. Later this afternoon, the couple will join other members of the royal family on Buckingham Palace\u0027s balcony to watch the RAF flypast and acknowledge the crowds. The Queen, who recently had a successful eye operation to remove a cataract, will watch the Trooping ceremony from a dais in Horse Guards and later inspect the lines of guardsmen in their scarlet tunics and bearskins.  More than 1,000 soldiers are taking part in the annual event with traditional display of pomp and pageantry. The colour being paraded this year is the flag of the 1st Battalion Coldstream Guards. The Duke of Edinburgh, who celebrates his 97th birthday on Sunday, has retired from official public duties and is not in attendance. The royal colonels, all on horseback, will accompany the Queen. They include the Prince of Wales, Colonel of the Welsh Guards, the Princess Royal, Colonel of the Blues and Royals, and the Duke of Cambridge, Colonel of the Irish Guards. Riding in the ceremony for the first time is the Duke of York in his new role as Colonel of the Grenadier Guards.  As with previous years, the Duchess of Cambridge and the Duchess of Cornwall sat together in a carriage. The procession is accompanied by a Sovereign\u0027s Escort of the Household Cavalry, made up of Life Guards and Blues and Royals, in their silver and gold breastplates and plumed helmets.

Almost a third of the 1,000 in HMP Humber claim to have got a drug habit while inside. There were 533 medical call-outs at the category C jail last year – more than 10 a week. Figures come from a new report by the jail’s Independent Monitoring Board, which said: “Psychoactive substances continue to be a major issue.” It said the East Yorks jail held a “high proportion of vulnerable individuals” and Spice increased “the level of violence on the wings”. Earlier this year prison chiefs ordered all mail to its inmates to be photocopied to prevent drug-soaked letters being delivered.  The move came after the Sunday People revealed Spice was being sprayed on to letters and even pictures drawn by children for their prisoner fathers. And nurses have been told to stop tending convicts at another jail awash with Spice – Holme House at Stockton-on-Tees – for fear of exposure to fumes. Glyn Travis, of the Prison Officers’ Association, said recently that Spice was an “epidemic” in prisons, causing violence, self-harm and suicides.

Louise Palai said her daughters, Alisa, six and Ebony, seven, had been misbehaving during a weekly shopping trip by running around the store and making too much noise. Furious, she made them sit with their heads down in silence in the middle of the vegetable aisle until they had calmed down.  The 35-year-old told the Derby  her tactic was better than smacking or shouting.  She insisted she would do it again somewhere as busy a shopping centre if she needed to get her kids to calm down and behave.  They don\u0027t mess about again when you make them sit in the supermarket, said Louise. They suddenly start behaving as they know everybody can see them. I don\u0027t care how old my daughters are, they need to learn to behave when they are out in public and making them have a time out wherever they may be, really calms them down and they stop messing about. Even if they were messing around in the street or in the intu centre, I would get them to do the same thing, no matter how many people are around, they would be forced to sit down and think about that they are doing. There were a few people giving me some odd looks, but I don\u0027t care what anybody thinks. This method works and it is a much better alternative to shouting at the girls in the middle of the street or smacking them like I have seen other parents do.  Louise made her youngsters sit down in Tesco , in Ilkeston, on Tuesday as they had been running round the store, making noise and being a nuisance to people.  When they failed to calm down, she made them sit on the floor with their heads down, cross legged, in silence. The children were sat down in the store for about ten minutes before they were allowed to move. Louise stated this is a method she has used at home making them sit on the stairs to calm them down. When out and about though, the youngsters have been forced to take a time out at other stores including Primark in Derby and York as well as the Albion Centre. She said: No matter where you go, there is always a step they can sit on, but if there is no step there is always the floor.

Because she got her old boyfriend’s number completely wrong... and ended up finding her Mr Right. Jennie feared she might never be happy again after her relationship broke down in the same year that her father died from a brain tumour. But the 21-year-old shop worker had used her mobile to accidentally contact a total stranger called Rob – and he turned out to be the man who could \u0026shyreally ring her bell.  Once he had answered Jennie’s \u0026shymessage, the couple got texting, then talking. They decided to meet, immediately fell in love and then got married. Seventeen years later the couple – who now have daughters Grace, 11, and Sophia , seven – are still inseparable. “Sometimes I forget how remarkable it is,” says Jennie. “It must have been a one in a million chance, but we just clicked straight away. I knew it was something special really early on. I’m a big believer in fate.” The couple’s love story began on a cold November evening in 2001. In a bid to move on from her ex, Jennie had deleted his number but then decided to get back in touch.  She said: “I’d had quite a bit to drink and was probably feeling sorry for \u0026shymyself, so I sent a text which simply said ‘Long time, no speak’. “I didn’t get a response. I thought he knew who it was but didn’t want to reply. It was only in the morning that I saw I had a message saying, ‘I think you’ve got the wrong number.’ “I thought it was my ex pretending he didn’t know who it was. So I texted back saying, ‘Very funny, it’s Jennie.’ “My now-husband came back on \u0026shysaying, ‘No, my name’s Rob. You’ve got the wrong number. I live in Germany.’” Engineer Rob, from Manchester, was 28 at the time and had two phones – an English one and a German one. He said: “I swear the English one had been turned off, but when I woke that morning it was on and there was this message from a wrong number.  “I don’t think I can explain why we got speaking, but we both just wanted to keep talking.” By the time the couple had established they were strangers, they were deep in text conversation. And Jennie could not get her stranger out of her mind. She said: “I was an \u0026shyassistant manager in a clothes shop in Belfast and I remember I kept going back to check my phone because I \u0026shywanted to hear from him. “It was very strange.” After a couple of weeks of texting, Jennie’s friends urged her to actually call her mystery man.  They were on a night out in Belfast while Rob was in an Irish bar in Germany, with his pals. Jennie said: “My friends were saying, ‘Ring him, ring him, and see what he’s like.’ I called, but he didn’t answer and I thought he didn’t want to speak to me. “What I didn’t know was he was \u0026shyholding his phone as it was ringing, but was too scared to answer.” Rob’s friends persuaded him to get over his nerves and call Jennie back. When he did, the couple spoke for an hour non-stop. “And since that day, we have spoken every day ever since,” said Jennie. The following month the pair finally met face-to-face at Belfast airport. They had swapped pictures and Rob spotted Jennie in the viewing gallery as he came off the plane.  He said: “I instantly knew that this was the girl I was \u0026shygoing to marry.” The feeling was mutual. Jennie said: “It was love at first sight. Something just clicked. We met, we hugged, we started a relationship.” The couple spent three \u0026shyhappy days together before Rob had to return to Germany. But he was back a few weeks later for Jennie’s graduation. She said: “It was such a special day and to have Rob there made it complete, especially as my dad couldn’t be there to see me.” Later Jennie was considering moving to Germany to spend some time with Rob when she reckons she got a mystic push in the right direction. She said: “I went with my mum to get her tea leaves read. “I didn’t want mine done but the woman did them anyway. She told me, ‘You’ve got a big decision to make about moving across water. I can’t tell you what to do, but it will change your life.’ I decided to take the plunge.” "},{"url":null,"title":"prince george silenced queens cheeky","story":"NewsPrince George\u0027s cheeky cousin covers his mouth as he sings National AnthemSeven-year-old Savannah Phillips - Princess Anne\u0027s grandaughter - stopped her cousin from singing during Trooping the Colour celebrations today\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByLucy Clarke-Billings13:38, 9 JUN 2018Updated17:54, 9 JUN 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailPrince George was silenced by his sassy cousin during Trooping the Colour celebrations today. Savannah Phillips stole the show as the royal family appeared on Buckingham Palace\u0027s balcony to watch the RAF flypast and acknowledge the crowds. The playful seven-year-old put her hand over George\u0027s mouth as the National Anthem began. The four-year-old prince appeared to giggle as he lent on his fist and watched the parade. Royal fans delighted at the scene and took to Twitter to praise Princess Anne\u0027s grandaughter. So sassy, one viewer said. They obviously have a really funny and sweet relationship.  Prince Harry and his new wife Meghan Markle, now known as the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, also attended the annual Trooping of the Colour celebration today. The ceremonial spectacle brings together prestigious regiments and the families of the serving men and women in celebration of the Queen\u0027s official birthday. Stands lining Horse Guards were filled with the wives, girlfriends and parents of the servicemen who when not performing ceremonial duties are fighting soldiers.  Meghan, Harry and the other members of the royal family took their place in Wellington\u0027s former office which overlooks the parade ground. The Duchess of Sussex wore a dress by Carolina Herrera and a hat by Philip Treacy, while Kate wore a dress by Alexander McQueen and a hat by Juliette Botterill. Camilla wore a pale blue silk dress and coat by Bruce Oldfield and a hat by Philip Treacy.  The Queen soon made her entrance onto Horse Guards in an Ascot Landau after making her journey from her famous London home Buckingham Palace. Her procession was accompanied by a Sovereign\u0027s Escort of the Household Cavalry, made up of Life Guards and Blues and Royals, in their silver and gold breastplates and plumed helmets. The 7,500 guests seated in stands lining the parade ground stood as a mark of respect as the monarch arrived and began inspecting the massed ranks of the troops. The Duke of Edinburgh, who celebrates his 97th birthday on Sunday, has retired from official public duties and did not attend. But the Queen was accompanied by the royal colonels, all on horseback: Prince of Wales, Colonel of the Welsh Guards, the Princess Royal, Colonel of the Blues and Royals, and the Duke of Cambridge, Colonel of the Irish Guards.

Can’t tell your claret from your beaujolais? More than half of British wine drinkers stick to the same bottle for around ten years – longer than the length of many a relationship – for fear of the unknown. Now a new free app promises to take away the confusion in the supermarket aisles by suggesting wines based on what you are eating and how much you want to pay. Corkscrew compares wines from Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Asda, Lidl, M\u0026ampS and Aldi plus chains such as Caf\u0026eacute Rouge and Cote.  Founder Matthew Gertner says: “Corkscrew was born to demystify the wine selection process and help people feel more confident picking wines.” Here the app’s sommelier Matt Day pairs 10 dishes with supermarket wines for under a tenner. The perfect pairings Chinese chicken with lemon sauce Match: Jim Barry The Lodge Hill Riesling – \u0026pound9.99 (Coop) Matt says: Riesling, originally from Germany, is widely grown in cooler areas. The light wines have sharp lemon acidity. This wine from Clare Valley, South Australia, is bone dry with lime sherbet character, perfect with the tangy lemon sauce. Fish and Chips Match: The Best Muscadet – \u0026pound7 (Morrisons) Matt says: Muscadet is made from the Melon de Bourgogne grape near the mouth of the Loire. Wines are light with a salty, lemony tang. Just like a squeeze of lemon or drop of vinegar the wine helps bring the fish alive and cuts through the stodginess of the chips. Indian lamb biryani Match: Busby Estate Sauvignon Blanc Semillon Margaret River – \u0026pound4.98 (Asda) Matt says: This Sauvignon Blanc and Semillon blend from Western Australia is rich and creamy with lemon, elderflower and vanilla. The slightly sweet edge helps temper spices and its fruit cuts through creamy rice and lamb.

I was known as “The Brow Queen” for my specialism – enhancing \u0026shyclients’ sparse or missing eyebrows with a digital tattoo pen. My client list included Towie stars like Jess Wright and sisters Billie and Sam Faiers. Then there was singer-songwriter Lisa Maffia, Brianne Delcourt from Dancing on Ice and Olympic cycling gold medallist Joanna Rowsell Shand. I featured in Vogue and briefly appeared on The Only Way Is Essex myself. I was flown around the world to give masterclasses to other cosmetic and medical tattooists too. Best of all, I got to give \u0026shysomething back, regularly providing free nipple restoration tattoos to cancer patients who had mastectomies. Life was good. Working in beauty, it was important that I looked my best.  So I had Botox twice a year, starting as soon as I hit 35. It felt like a minor part of my beauty regime, no more serious than getting my nails done. It was only after 10 years of treatments, in April 2015, that one Botox jab felt different. Almost immediately I felt awful, like I was coming down with the flu. The morning after, I woke to find my face felt really wrong. I couldn’t see out of one eye and gasped in horror when I looked in the mirror and saw my lopsided reflection. Over the following weeks things got worse. I felt constantly exhausted and even began to find walking difficult. I developed a tremor and struggled to hold my head up.  I found it hard to swallow, got easily confused and forming sentences was difficult. The skin on my arms became mottled and veiny and my hands turned a weird colour. They soon became so weak I couldn’t hold my tattoo pen for work. Doctors initially suspected fibromyalgia but that didn’t seem to fit what was happening to me. I felt like I was dying. In desperation I put my symptoms into Google and was immediately taken to a forum for people who had suffered Botox poisoning. It turned out I wasn’t alone. I sought out a private specialist who confirmed the \u0026shydiagnosis, saying mine was the worst case he has seen. I’ve since learned that Botox can cross the blood-brain barrier and strip the protective sheath from your nerves. Three years on, I have had a stroke and suffer daily seizures. I’ve been given epilepsy medication to help with the seizures but other than that the NHS has said it can do no more for me.

Beaming Harry, 33, and Meghan, 36, enjoyed the pomp and the pageantry of the Trooping the Colour ceremony exactly three weeks after they tied the knot. The former Suits actress – wearing a Carolina Herrera dress and a Philip Treacy hat – sat alongside the Prince in his official Blues and Royals procession uniform. The Queen enjoyed the traditional ceremony to mark her official birthday but attended without Prince Philip- who retired from public duties last year and turns 97 tomorrow. It is the fourth time the Duke of Edinburgh has missed the event. Best Trooping The Colour 2018 pictures: The Queen celebrates her 92nd birthday along with Meghan, Kate, William and Harry The Duchess of Sussex has been credited with bringing the Royal Family into the 21st Century and broke with tradition by marrying away from London. However she dazzled the thousands of Royal fans who lined The Mall with her regal look as she elegantly made her way to the palace with her new husband. It was the pair’s second formal engagement since their showstopping wedding on May 19 and comes after a rumoured mini-honeymoon in Canada. The crowds whooped in delight as the Royal Air Force demonstrated their might with a flypast of 23 aircraft, ending when the Red Arrows left a blaze of red, white and blue smoke over London. But as the jets and helicopter thundered overhead, Princess Charlotte was left in floods of tears and had to be comforted by the Duchess of Cambridge – who wore a dress by Alexander McQueen and a hat by Juliette Botterill – after dropping her plane-spotting book which had been given to the children from the balcony.  Prince George, four, was joined by his cousin, Savannah Phillips, seven, daughter of Peter Phillips and granddaughter of Princess Anne, who stole the show with her antics on the balcony. As crowds sang God Save The Queen, Savannah made gestures as if she were an orchestra conductor, getting in to the spirit of the day. But the little one didn’t seem impressed with her cousin Prince George’s singing, as she placed her hand over his mouth. There was no sign of the third little Cambridge Prince Louis, born in April. Meanwhile the Queen cut a lonely figure as she arrived at the parade in an Ascot Landau without Prince Philip by her side.  The Duke of Edinburgh attended last year, but underwent a hip operation in April. He is understood to have “spent the weekend in private” after officially retiring from public duties last year. Philip – who celebrates his 97th birthday today – has missed the occasion four times in the past and was last seen during Harry and Meghan’s nuptials in Windsor on May 19. Her Majesty the Queen – who underwent secret cataract surgery earlier this year – was celebrating her 92nd birthday and attended her 66th parade as sovereign – a record unmatched by any other British monarch. She used a blanket to keep herself warm in a carriage on the way to the Horse Guard’s Parade and wore a sky blue coat and dress by Stuart Parvin and a hat by Angela Kelly. And while her husband was not present for the big day, the Queen was accompanied by members of her family as part of their roles as Royal Colonels.  Prince William rode out on horseback wearing full regalia and bearskins, and was accompanied by the Prince of Wales and Princess Anne who saluted as they entered The Mall. Also riding in the ceremony for the first time was the Duke of York in his new role as Colonel of the Grenadier Guards, taking over from his father Prince Philip. A soldier who wore a turban during the Trooping the Colour has said he hopes it is looked upon as a “new change in history”. Guardsman Charanpreet Singh Lall became the first person in history to wear the headwear during the ceremony.  The 22-year-old from Leicester said: “I hope that people watching, that they will just acknowledge it and that they will look at it as a new change in history. “I hope that more people like me, not just Sikhs but from other religions and different backgrounds, that they will be encouraged to join the Army.” A member of the 1st Battalion Coldstream Guards, Gdsm Lall’s turban featured the ceremonial cap star to match the bearskin hats. Gdsm Lall who joined the British Army in January 2016, was born in Punjab, India, and moved to the UK as a baby, said he is feeling ‘quite excited’ ahead of the event. He said: “I’m quite proud and I know that a lot of other people are proud of me as well. “It is a good feeling... there’s going to be a lot of eyes and I am going to have an influence on other people.” After the ceremony, the Royals joined more than 1,400 guardsmen and cavalry for the magnificent parade through the heart of London yesterday to honour the Queen. A former head of the armed forces was rushed to hospital after slumping from his horse during the Trooping the Colour ceremony.  Field Marshal Lord Guthrie of Craigiebank was “receiving medical attention” following the incident, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) said. The 79-year-old could be seen lying on the ground and surrounded by police officers immediately after the fall, and was then attended to by paramedics. Royal fans lining The Mall looked on in horror as the incident unfolded near the Victoria Memorial in front of Buckingham Palace. Pictures show Lord Guthrie on the ground with a pained expression on his face, as officers rush to his aid while another officer leads his horse away. Former SAS commander Lord Guthrie was head of the British Army between 1994 and 1997 and then chief of defence staff until 2001. Meanwhile, a 51-year-old woman was arrested for a public order offence after an item was thrown towards the procession, Scotland Yard said. The woman was being held at a central London police station. A Met Police spokesman said: “A 51-year-old woman was arrested for a public order offence after an item was thrown towards a procession at the Trooping the Colour. “She is currently in custody at a central London police station.” Earlier in the day a cheeky fox delighted Royal fans as they waited to catch a glimpse of the Queen during her annual birthday parade.  The creature ran onto Horse Guard’s Parade as hundreds of people began to gather for the start of the ceremony. The fox darted out from under the stands as it searched for a way into nearby St James’s Park. Trooping the Colour is a ceremonial spectacle that brings together prestigious regiments and the families of the serving men and women in celebration of the monarch’s official birthday. Stands lining Horse Guards were filled with 7,500 of the wives, girlfriends and parents of the servicemen who when not performing ceremonial duties are fighting soldiers. Other guests included Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson who stood in for Prime Minister Theresa May while she attends a G7 meeting of world leaders in Canada.

The key to living well in a caravan or motorhome is efficient use of space. And below we\u0027ve teamed up with Halfords to tell you all the tricks of the trade for making the most of what you have. Follow these top accessorizing tips and all you\u0027ll have to worry about is where the next BBQ sausage or shandy is coming from as you relax and unwind. Happy holidays! Extend your space  No matter how spacious your caravan there\u0027s always going to be the need for a bit more space. With the glorious summer weather there\u0027s no reason not to move outside and create an additional living area, a lounge outdoors if you like.  The Urban Escape Event Shelter , above, has two sides and offers 50+ UPF, which means it filters out up to 98 per cent of UV rays. The water resistance is also capable of seeing off moderate rain too.   Rain or shine a gazebo is a great way to keep you comfortable. They offer shelter if it rains and sun protection if it\u0027s gloriously hot.    While you\u0027re out in the sun enjoying lunch you\u0027ll probably want something to sit on too, so take a look at the Urban Escape Folding Chairs , above, in either black or blue, for \u0026pound20 (save \u0026pound20) or treat yourself to the ultimate in luxury with the Urban Escape King Size Moonchair , now just \u0026pound30 (save \u0026pound30).  Cook and eat outside  Cooking inside is all well and good, but there\u0027s nothing like a BBQ in the great outdoors.  You won\u0027t want to lug around a massive cooker though, so consider the Halfords Briefcase BBQ , a compact little device that will allow you to cook for a couple of people, or get two for larger families - they\u0027re only \u0026pound10 each (save \u0026pound5).   If you need some extra space for eating then the Halfords Aluminium Roll Up Table , below, is now only \u0026pound20 (save \u0026pound10) and packs flat for easy storage in your caravan.    Pair this with the outdoor chairs we suggested earlier and you\u0027re ready for an outdoor meal with all the comforts of home. If sitting on the floor is more your thing, grab a Halfords XL Waterproof Picnic Blanket , \u0026pound10 (save \u0026pound10) to keep you dry on damp ground.  It\u0027s also important to be able to keep meat, fish and drinks nice and cool when you\u0027re enjoying the outdoor cooking.   The Halfords 40 Litre Coolbox , above, offers temperatures 16 degrees celsius lower than the ambient temperature and can be powered from a 240v mains supply or a 12/24v car supply.  Absolutely perfect for caravan and outdoor use and the fitted wheels mean it\u0027s not a hassle to move heavy food about. It\u0027s also just \u0026pound85 (save \u0026pound25). Every home convenience  To attain the goal of real luxury you need to be able to relax in your caravan or motorhome and make it a home away from home.  Electricity is going to be important and while your motorhome or caravan might have a power hookup, it\u0027s worth packing an additional Halfords Triple Mains Kit which is down to just \u0026pound30 (save \u0026pound20) it\u0027s protected by an RCD and is splashproof.   This is a really useful accessory if you\u0027re using the Halfords 40 Litre coolbox above and it allows you some flexibility if you make a pit-stop en route.  You\u0027ll also want some nice tablewear to eat from, the good news is that Halfords has plenty of tough plates, cups and wine glasses that can survive life on the road and won\u0027t easily break.

There were huge cheers as the newlyweds joined other royals in front of an excited crowd for Trooping the Colour today, but in a whisper to her husband the former actress admitted to suffering from nerves, MirrorOnline can reveal. To the general public at large, the Duchess of Sussex looked comfortable and at ease alongside Harry as she waited to curtsy to the Queen in front of the huge crowd gathered on the Mall. However it now appears she needed some reassurance from those stood around her.  Meghan was making her debut on the palace balcony to mark the Queen’s birthday celebrations just three weeks after the royal wedding in Windsor. She stood next to Harry but slightly behind future Queen Kate Middleton who chatted to Camilla as they waited for Her Majesty to arrive. According to a lipreader, at one point Harry wipes his mouth as he turns to talk to Meghan and asks her simply: Okay? His wife replies: Yeah, are you? Harry replies simply: Yeah. After asking each other if they were “okay”, Meghan also admitted to Harry that she was “nervous!” Harry replies Yes and then smiles before saying okay?    In further snippets of conversation spotted as they turned towards the camera, Harry appears to say: “Errr. When you get into it I\u0027ll tell you more later.” Seconds later, he adds: “Then there\u0027s the flypast and then we all look up to the sky.” Meghan further responds with “alright” a couple of times while continuing to smile at the thousands of people on the grounds outside Buckingham Palace. After the Queen arrived and took her place front and centre, Meghan could be seen smiling brightly over her shoulder throughout the rest of the gathering. It has been a whirlwind few weeks for the young royals, with Meghan walking down the aisle to wed Harry after a series of public family fallouts, including concerns over her father’s health. However, the former Suits star has managed to keep her nerves away from view at a series of public events - and with many more to come, she is likely to get used to the bigger displays.

For many people surfing the web, the tradition of an interactive game or article at the top of the Google homepage is something to look forward to, but June 10th’s topic may surprise quite a few.  It is a whole day dedicated to garden gnomes - and there will even be a game for people to play.  The bosses at Google Doodle have decided that the humble garden gnome deserves to be talked about, and, as we have a look at what it is all about, it\u0027s obvious that there’s plenty of fun to be had. The creative team said: “Gnome figures first appeared in 13th-century Anatolia and re-emerged in 16th-century Italy. “The common garden gnome originated in 19th-century Germany from the mining area of Thuringia. “Here, local craftsmen are given credit for hand-crafting the gnomes as we know them—with shaggy beards and pointy hats.  “Propelled by local myths and increased leisure time, the gnomes began to find homes in gardens throughout the country. Legend has it they protect these gardens and bring good luck.” In the interactive Doodle, you’ll learn a bit more about how the gnome is made. Then, you’ll enlist a group of gnomes to help you decorate a garden of your own.

Gaffer Neil suggested Murray was just trying too hard to shine in front of his fellow-Dundee supporters and was happy with his contribution.The Dee boss is desperate to add more threat to his side and

illness.Although Ethel often visited Dundee she only moved back permanently to Broughty Ferry in February, where she now lives with son Brian.Although Ethel’s hearing is starting to deteriorate at the grand age of 106, she has had no major operations and her memory is second to none as she often reflects on her time playing field hockey as a goalie or her time spent travelling the world competing

constantly people coming around the house, other people from the opera would all come around, drink some wine and sing some songs,\u0026#8221 he said.\u0026#8220It was mainly classical music that I was interested in when I was very very young.\u0026#8220If there was ever any children\u0026#8217s parts, me and my sister would get dressed up and thrown on stage, I sure to enjoy that.\u0026#8220There was never much singing involved, it was mostly just being children running around on stage.\u0026#8221Tristan said he started playing the cornet when he was four or five, and then moved on to the baritone horn while he was a student at Grange Primary School in Monifieth.\u0026#8220But I always wanted to play the trombone and they didn\u0026#8217t have one in the music department, but eventually the must have got a bit of extra cash and got a trombone so I started playing the trombone,\u0026#8221 he said.\u0026#8220And I did that right thought to near the end of high school.\u0026#8221While he trained and began working as an engineer, he started DJing electronic and hip-hop music, later moving into scratch DJing.\u0026#8220Some of my friends had a band and my best friend had just been asked to be the drummer so he asked if I wanted to come along and do some scratching on top of the music,\u0026#8221 he said.After a few weeks, Tristan asked if they were ok with him bringing along his synthesizers and the band kicked off from there.\u0026#8220It was great, we had a great time doing that and the band was together for about 12 years.\u0026#8221Spending

business classes and looked into what it would involve, but the timing didn\u0026#8217t feel quite right.Then in 2007, both his parents passed away within two months of each other.\u0026#8220It kind of just turned my life on it\u0026#8217s head,\u0026#8221 he said.He quit his job and spent six months travelling around Australia with his future wife, before coming back to DundeeThen in 2009 he was told that a charity studio run by his friend\u0026#8217s dad near the Marketgait was up for sale, and Tristan decided to take the chance.\u0026#8220It was quite a big thing for me, a bit of a massive thing for me actually but at that point in my life it was a risk I was willing to take,\u0026#8221 he said.He launched the studio, a band booked one of his rooms full time and the business began to slowly grow, but it wasn\u0026#8217t until about a year and a half after opening that it began to turn profitable.\u0026#8220I remember six months into it being really really worried about things,

opportunity to realise their full potential.“It’s a message that sits well with Dundonians who have a long history of tolerance and reaching out to those who are oppressed.”The launch event has been organised, with support from Anne Frank Scotland’s staff, by a steering group of teenaged Anne Frank Ambassadors.Several of them are taking centre stage, delivering speeches, presentations and singing.In the last decade Anne Frank Scotland has created more than 400 such ambassadors from among the tens of thousands of young people it has worked with.Eilidh Lean, Anne Frank Scotland Project Officer said: “Our young people unfailingly amaze and inspire us through their commitment, honesty, insight and enthusiasm for their work: sharing Anne’s story and challenging prejudice within their schools and communities.”The exhibition runs until June 27.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2015/06/image.jpg1_.373139.jpg ","title":"dundee school

their list of targets.Both are free agents, though, the Tangerines face a battle to land either signature.Etxabeguren was released by the Dark Blues last month after an injury-hit year and has returned to Spain.Whether he can be enticed back to Scotland remains to be seen, although, he did enjoy his time in Dundee.Morris, meanwhile, told Dunfermline he was leaving them to return to England but a move back to former club United might be enough for him to shelve those plans.The 28-year-old played 45 times for Jackie McNamara at Tannadice over two seasons but, like Etxabeguren, has a history of injuries.He did play 40 games last season for the Pars, however.Also on the list is former Partick man Frederic Frans.The Belgian centre-back is wanted by his former club also, as well as fellow-Championship side Ross County.Meanwhile, United have announced their first pre-season friendly.Csaba Laszlo’s men will head to Brechin City on Tuesday, July 3, kick-off 7.45pm.That sees both

Leonard, 59, has lived close to Menzieshill Wood – known as the quarry – for 18 years and said the grass is the worst he has seen it.Vincent said: “The grass is so overgrown you can hardly see your dog at times. It is knee high in patches. It hasn’t been cut this year.“From what I’ve been told by environmental health, the entire quarry should be getting cut completely once a month.“I was told the whole lot of it would get done every month, and it’s not been done.“The last couple of years they have been doing what they call ‘picture framing’ – cutting the edges but not the middle – this year they just did the path.“It is that bad at the moment, it needs it all done.”Vincent said he has complained in the past and within hours somebody has visited the site to cut it.He said he walks his dog, Jack, round the quarry four times a day, and that occasionally, even when the Jack Russell is on a lead, there are times when he cannot see him.He added there are a lot of new houses being built in the area and that children come down to play in the woods.He said: “The kids are rolling in it, it’s that long. You don’t know what they are rolling in.“I have been told there is broken glass but I haven’t seen it myself.”He says he has been in touch with the council, which has not responded, and also contacted a local councillor who has also not responded.“They just planted about 70 trees there so I don’t know if that is their excuse not to cut the grass,” he added.“In the past there have been dogs hurt.“The grass has never been so bad before. I have lived here 18 years and never seen it this bad.“There is a fair bit of dog mess. I’m very frustrated.”A Dundee City Council spokeswoman said: “We are undertaking improvement works in this area, and have planted additional plants and trees. This is an ongoing project and we will be looking at ways to make the area more attractive for people to enjoy and this will involve cutting the grass.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b1a516c449eb.jpg ","title":"jack hamilton signing a great bit of business says derek soutar","story":"\t\t\t\t\tSigning 24-year-old Jack Hamilton is “a great piece of business” according to a man who knows a thing or two about keeping goal for Dundee.Derek ‘Soapy’ Soutar had two spells at Dens Park, totalling eight years, and has seen first-hand how good Hamilton can be.After Soutar suffered an injury in his time at Forfar back in 2012, a young keeper by the name of Hamilton came in on emergency loan to cover at the age of 18.Watching his progress since, Soutar was delighted to see him arrive at Dundee.Soutar said: “I was very surprised Hearts let him go.“He came in on loan at Forfar when he was just 18. He was a great size, very athletic and a really good shot-stopper, great at one-on-ones and his distribution was excellent, too.“With Jon McLaughlin leaving I thought it would be the ideal chance for Craig Levein to put Jack in for pre-season.“He’s moved on, though, and Dundee have a great signing.“I worked with Jack, he’s a great lad and really down to earth personality.“I think it’s a great bit of business by Neil McCann.“He’s a good age with plenty of experience as well at Hearts and all the different levels with Scotland.“It’s a massive signing for Dundee – he could be there for years to come.“He will have to bide his time, though, because Elliott Parish did really well at the end of last season after Scott Bain left.“Every goalie is going to have times when it’s not going for you but Elliott got through that and didn’t do a lot wrong. He’ll take some shifting for Jack.“What it will do is push Parish to be as good as he can because he knows Jack will be breathing down his neck.”After a steady first season at the now renamed Kilmac Stadium, Parish will feel he’s the current No 1 at the club but the arrival of another senior goalie can spur both to excel – and that’s good news for the Dark Blues.Hamilton has represented Scotland at every age level from U/15 to U/21 and was called up to a squad by Gordon Strachan in May 2016.He didn’t get a first senior cap but Soutar reckons he can push his way back into the national set-up by impressing for Dundee.He added: “Not so long ago he was in the Scotland squad.“He maybe lost a bit of confidence last season at Hearts and being on the bench.“He’s very professional and will push himself to the max to make sure he’s ready for pre-season at Dundee.“He’s very level-headed, he’s not one for the big-time if you know what I mean, he’s not a flashy kind of guy.“I know the kind of level Jack can play at, I’ve worked with him and I think he could get himself back in the Scotland set-up while at Dundee.“Whatever fee was paid, he’ll definitely justify it.“Further down the line, he could even get Dundee a fee if he moves on so, for that reason, I think it’s a great piece of business.“Working with (goalkeeping coach) Rab Geddes every week, too, can only bring the best out in Jack.“A three-year deal gives him security and playing for a manager who wants him in Neil McCann will help no end.”The former Dundee and Aberdeen goalie, meanwhile, is still going strong with his Derek Soutar Goalkeeping Academy.“It’s still going really well,” he added. “That’s us had 38 goalies over seven years go on to play pro-youth and we’ve had one recently go out to the US for a scholarship.”Any budding young goalies can find out more on the academy’s Facebook page.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b17b6e6b90a2.jpg ","title":"manchester united boss jose mourinho watches dundees former arsenal midfielder glen kamara amid transfer speculation","story":"\t\t\t\t\tJose Mourinho was watching as Dundee’s Glen Kamara picked up his fourth international cap in Finland’s friendly defeat in Romania.The 22-year-old has drawn plenty of interest in his time at the Dark Blues – Mourinho, however, was only there as a guest of Romanian agent Ioan Becali and stressed in an ad-hoc TV interview he wasn’t looking at players, just enjoying his time off.Kamara, meanwhile, despite only joining up with the Finnish national squad on Monday, played the majority of the second half in Ploiesti.The Finns, ranked 62nd in the world and not at this year’s World Cup, started the friendly match well but fell behind in the first half to Cristean Manea’s 37th-minute strike.In the second period, Kamara made his entrance after 57 minutes for Nottingham Forest’s Thomas Lam but almost immediately the team fell further behind.On 61 minutes, winger Ciprian Deac finished from close range to give the Romanians a home victory.Finland boss Markku Kanerva said: “The start was challenging but we looked good. We fought well and did not give up.“Of course, we should not be satisfied with this result but we did not have a full squad.“At the end, we got a little bit to attack more.“I had to think a little about the team when Pyry Soiri and Glen Kamara were only involved on Monday for the first time so they only played the second period.“There was little to be done in the last third.

In other words, we are going to reward success – and reward it quite handsomely.“However, we’re not going to reward failure. We have been very clear to the players still here, and those joining, that we expect success and are happy to pay for that success.

I think that says it all.“He was such a competitor. That’s what always struck you about him.“The ceremony is a brilliant way to commemorate his life. It shows his family a lot of folk are thinking about him.”After the service, fans praised the touching tribute.Duncan Smith, 46, of Heathryfold, said: “It was brilliant. Absolutely superb, and quite emotional.“He was a proper Aberdeen loon.“The Gothenburg Greats were my heroes when I was a kid.”Valerie Donald, 53, of Hardgate, said: “It was just brilliant. It was really emotional, and it was very well organised as well.“There were lots of lovely stories about him, they put a lot of thought into it.”Graham Morrice, 56, from Woodside, said: “It was a great tribute to a great man. Aberdeen thought the world of him, and he thought the world of Aberdeen.”Two fans, Patricia and Ali Anderson, travelled from Elgin to be at the ceremony.Ali said: “It was brilliant.“There’s not many people who would get that.”Patricia, who knew him, added: “It was just exactly him. That’s exactly what he was like. He was a wonderful person.”Tributes, which included football shirts, scarves and banners, as well as numerous flowers, were lined up in the ground as well as flower displays carrying the messages“Stand Free” and “RIP” Tattie.Amid the sadness were plenty of smiles as fans heard tales from the former Dons star’s life, with many speakers greeted with cheers and prolonged applause.The event also included videos of Neale, and included his recent appearance at the Gothenburg Greats night on May 11, as well as excerpts from interviews and press calls over the years.Images spanned his entire career, including his famous goal against Rangers in the 1982 Scottish Cup final, and his time as manager for Ross County.A book of condolence was set up in the lower concourse of the Richard Donald Stand for anyone who wanted to leave their thoughts and well-wishes following the ceremony.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"teacher recruitment change successful","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA north-east council\u0026#8217s revamped teacher recruitment process has led to more people opting to work in the area.Previously Moray Council’s schools were losing out on teaching staff due to a lengthy interview process which saw schools essentially competing against each other.The time this process took meant many teachers accepted jobs elsewhere.This year the newly-qualified teachers underwent just one interview and were deployed to vacancies across the area within weeks.The new process has meant that 22 newly-qualified teachers will be boosting numbers in Moray’s schools from August.In addition, many were originally from the area and had come back after university to complete their training and start their teaching career on home turf.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column 24","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 17/05/18, 11:31 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.We heartily agree with the decision of the Lord Lieutenant to nominate Betty Rhodick to attend the royal wedding.As far as we are aware, no one works harder for Lochgilphead  \u0026#8211 and once Betty puts her mind to something\u0026#8230Betty and Geordie have been the figureheads for the Lochgilphead Armed Forces Day commemorations since they started, but she deserves this recognition not just for this one annual event, but for all she does on our behalf.Enjoy yourself, Betty and Kelly.The renovated Kilmartin Museum is now almost within reach.This is sure to be of great economic benefit to the region when it opens in two years and it is an exciting prospect that will enable the unique heritage of Mid Argyll to be properly showcased.Just what was last weekend\u0026#8217s Scapa festival at Ardkinglas?The answer is probably unique to every individual who attended.

At times when the builders are working the gulls understandably leave the site but then return during the evenings and at weekends. Several birds were again sitting on apparent nests as recently as May 4, however it looks like many others may have moved elsewhere.Measures have since been taken by the builders to encourage the birds to leave the area prior to laying their eggs and to give them a chance of nesting elsewhere soon. Recently I had a meeting with SNH (Scottish Natural Heritage) and the RSPB and both were sympathetic and understanding of the situation.I also plan to meet with the Scottish Canals environmental scientist soon in the hope that perhaps provision can be made, within the scope of the hub project, to allow for a nesting area for the Common Gulls in future years at the site.This could give rise to an exciting opportunity enabling the public and visitors to the new heritage centre to view these gulls raise their chicks, for which is effectively the rarest colony of nesting birds in the Crinan Canal corridor.Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,This week Allt Dearg Wind Farm distributed over £135,000 to the Ardrishaig Community Trust, which holds the village\u0026#8217s share in this locally owned wind farm.Combined with the recent payments to the Tighnabruaich and Tarbert Trusts which hold similar shares in the neighbouring Sròndoire Wind Farm, together with the wind farms\u0026#8217 contributions to the local educational trust, this brings the total direct community benefit payments from these projects to well over £ 1 million.This is a significant milestone for the projects, and highlights the socio-economic advantages of local ownership in wind power. Despite its relatively small capacity Allt Dearg is the single largest contributor of community benefit payments in Argyll.This week the UK Government published the results of its latest tracking survey of public attitudes to energy and climate change. This shows continued growth in support for on-shore wind, and eight in ten agreed that renewable energy developments should provide direct benefits to the communities in which they are located.Some objections to wind farms remain, and our turbines remain visible in the distance. We hope that the views of Allt Dearg and Sròndoire might remind such objectors that we are economically dependent on what we can produce from the limited options available to us in remote rural areas. That our particular wind farms are able to make a significant contribution to local employment and deliver funding direct to our neighbouring communities, whilst supplying around 20 per cent of Argyll and Bute’s annual domestic electricity requirements from a clean renewable resource, is very satisfying.We would like to thank all those who have made these projects the successes they are, and in particular thank those local community councillors and trust members who have given so much of their time in recent years to make this all happen. For our part, we will continue our efforts to grow the industry and economic activity that provides secure employment and opportunity for our local community.We look forward to our community partners being able to invest the fruits of these wind farms into exciting local projects.Mary Broadfoot of Stronachullin and James F Lithgow of OrmsarySir,Loneliness is a major issue in society and affects everyone from all walks of life, regardless of age or ability.That’s why we’re pleased the Scottish Government is looking at the development of a new approach to tackling the issues of loneliness and social isolation – something we have first-hand experience of and how it affects many of the people we support in Scotland.Following a recent survey of over 150 service users of our homecare services in Stirling, Falkirk, Perth and Kinross, and Angus which focused solely on loneliness and social isolation, it was revealed that loneliest people receive far fewer visitors each week. While this is hardly surprising, we did find that those who either lived with family or had family close by were less at risk of loneliness and the negative health impacts associated. Our research also highlighted that respondents, in most cases, simply wanted a chat over a cuppa with someone their own age.Social interactions are something the vast majority of us take for granted as we all lead such busy lives, but for someone who is alone, watching time go by very slowly, it’s incredibly painful for them to sit at home day after day with no communication from the outside world.Charities such as Sue Ryder regularly arrange social events for our service users and their families.But if, as a nation, we’re serious about tackling loneliness as a public health issue then we need to be resourcing our local authorities to put in place services or to commission them from the third sector to ensure that no one feels alone and isolated in Scotland.Pamela Mackenzie, director of neurological services and Scotland, Sue Ryder, StirlingSir,This spring we hope your readers will celebrate the royal wedding with their very own Right Royal Tea Party in aid of Meningitis Now.Putting on a spread fit for a royal wedding is a piece of cake with our free fundraising pack and, as Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have requested charity donations rather than wedding presents, you can fulfil their wishes whilst helping families affected by this devastating disease.A royal-themed Time4Tea can be held anytime, not just on Saturday May 19, the date of the Royal Wedding. And it can take place anywhere – at home, at work, at school.Just pop the kettle on, slice up a cake or two, homemade or bought (you have to have cake at a wedding) and invite friends, relatives and colleagues to enjoy a cuppa or perhaps even a glass of champagne.The serious point is that you’ll be helping to fight meningitis and move us one step closer to our vision of a future where no one in the UK dies from meningitis \u0026#8211 and everyone affected gets the support they need to rebuild their life.Sadly, despite developments in vaccines, meningitis and septicaemia continue to affect thousands every year and kill more under-fives than any other infectious disease.

Therefore, we support separating pedestrians, cyclists and motorists through an expansion of the network of walking and cycling paths across Scotland.We would like to stress, however, that measures like these will not single-handedly lead to safer roads. The road mentality in Scotland still favours the motorist over more vulnerable road users, which presents a huge barrier to more people taking up active lifestyles.More needs to be done to change our road culture for people in Scotland to feel safer regardless of their means of transportation, ultimately empowering them to lead healthier and more active lifestyles.Perhaps it is time we started to beat the ‘presumed liability’ drum once again?Brenda Mitchell, Road Traffic Accident Law (Scotland) LLP, Edinburgh.Sir,Some people have difficulty getting up and down the steps on the Glasgow bus. We asked West Coast Motors about this and they gave us the answer we wanted.All Citylink buses are fitted with an access ramp, worked by the driver. A platform comes out on to the pavement, with a holding bar, and is then raised up to floor level. This is designed as a wheelchair lift, where two seats at the front have to be arranged to be taken out, to give plenty of room.It was agreed, however, that if someone felt nervous about climbing up or down the stairs, they could also use the access platform. Once they have paid their ticket, they can walk to a seat.West Coast Motors asks anyone wanting this service to please remember two things.Firstly, book your single or return tickets by phone or on the Citylink website.Then, 48 hours before your journey, phone Citylink and tell them the times and details of the booking you have made and let them know you will be using the access ramp. The telephone number is 08712 663333.Kirsty McCuaig and Patricia Crawford, Mid Argyll Buddies.Sir,The ongoing effects of weather, bureaucracy and concern for the future continue to put our countryside under pressure, with few avenues to turn to for support.This can have dramatic consequences for the rural economy and the people who live and work there.The Prince’s Countryside Fund is committed to supporting community-led projects that will re-invigorate and sustain farming networks and the countryside by providing services and amenities through its grant programme.Open for applications until June 14, grants are available for up to £50,000. If you are involved in a community-run or farming support project and think your organisation may benefit – or if you know someone who might –  visit  www.princescountrysidefund. org.uk/grants.The fund has supported a diverse range of projects, including a community transport app in Argyll and projects on Barra, Orkney and Shetland. We are proud to have distributed more than £9 million since 2010 to more than 250 projects led by these grassroots organisations.It is crucial we help rural areas during these times of change to retain a thriving countryside and encourage a sustainable farming sector in the UK and would encourage people to apply for our funding.Claire Saunders, director, The Prince’s Countryside Fund.Sir,At first sight, it seems odd that the controversy over the reported disturbance to common gulls, oystercatchers and black guillemots at the old oil depot in Ardrishaig is focused on a breeding colony of common gulls.I’m no bird expert and hadn’t realised common gulls are less common than the bigger varieties or that they’re a declining species.But among the reasons given for this are predation by mink and the loss of open rubbish dumps and both might be contributing factors in Mid Argyll.It’s surely hardly surprising that the only breeding colony along the canal is at the Ardrishaig end, where the urbanisation around the tidal flats of Loch Gilp and the Lingerton dump offer prime scavenging opportunities.I don’t know whether they lose out to the bigger gull species when it comes to local island nesting sites, or whether the old Gleaner site might offer other advantages, for example, maybe less vulnerable to mink predation – but could it be the gulls are there primarily because of man-made feeding opportunities and that they’ll find an alternative site that’s similarly convenient?Likewise, the smaller populations of oystercatchers and black guillemots, however, although they’re also both amber listed they don’t scavenge and seem to be more dependent on the sea and shore for their livelihoods.Their decline might be of more concern but they’re hopefully less swayed towards easy pickings around Loch Gilp and more evenly distributed to Loch Crinan.Perhaps Jim Dickson and Andrew Tongue can enlighten us further on just how endangered the populations of these three species are in Mid Argyll.Robert Wakeham, Lochgilphead.Sir,Please would the parents of the young girl who may have witnessed a recent incident with a man and dog in Inveraray Main Street contact my husband and I through this newspaper?We saw a man who, we believe, mistreated a dog in the street at 8.30pm on Sunday April 29.We are both keen to know this young person is alright as she appeared to be frightened, running off at speed with her two dogs.Knowing she was fine would put our minds at rest.

Beyond our concerns for public safety, this systematic under-investment is slowing our economy and costing local councils a fortune in compensation for car owners.We recognise the importance of well-maintained roads and we are willing to invest in it.The SNP has consistently neglected Scotland’s roads and the results are obvious for everyone to see.Councillor Alastair Redman, Islay.On Monday May 14, I spotted six swallows over the rear of Meadows Place, hopefully heralding a decent summer.First seen this year.Mike Power, Lochgilphead.Sir,During this week\u0026#8217s Holyrood vote on the UK Government’s Withdrawal Bill, Labour, the Greens and LibDems joined the SNP in an overwhelming rejection of the UK Government’s currently-drafted Brexit plans, voting 93 to 30 against the bill.While the Scottish Government agrees in the need for UK-wide frameworks, it has described the retention of the overall control of agriculture, fisheries, food labelling and public procurement as a power grab.The Scottish Parliament has spoken loudly and clearly, and if the UK Government wants us to believe they value Scotland and devolution, they must respect the vote and remove the proposed power grab.Any constraints placed on the existing powers of the Scottish Parliament without consent would be a democratic outrage.During Prime Minister\u0026#8217s Questions, Theresa May failed to reassure us she will respect the decision of the Scottish Parliament. If she does choose to ignore the vote and force through this legislation, she will be breaking the conventions of the 20-year-old devolution settlement and imposing a power grab upon Scotland against our will.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters natures patterns","story":"\t\tDorothy H CrawfordUpdated: 20/05/18, 11:47 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe natural world abounds in beautiful patterns, each evolved to enhance survival of a species \u0026#8211 the extravagant, iridescent peacock’s tail, which serves to attract a mate, while intricate orchid flowers entice pollinators and tigers’ stripes provide camouflage.But not all nature’s patterns are quite as showy it is the mathematical symmetries that I find most intriguing.Italian mathematician Leonardo Fibonacci lived in 12th century Algeria when Indian numerals were introduced to the West via the Middle East.  In his book, Liber Abaci (published in 1202), he describes a numerical sequence, now called the Fibonacci sequence, in which each number is the sum of the previous two digits: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 ad infinitum. He formulated this recurrence in relation to rabbit breeding, but it turns out to be exceedingly wide-spread in nature, from tree branching to mollusc shell growth to bee reproduction.Plant leaves are like solar panels, absorbing sunlight to power energy-providing photosynthesis.  Thus, leaves appear in a spiral around the stem, each positioned to optimise sunlight capture.  The ratio of leaves to turns is always a ration of Fibonacci numbers 3 leaves to 1 turn for hazel, 8/3 for pear and 13/5 for almond trees.  The angle between consecutive leaves is always close to 137.5o, called ‘the golden angle’ – perfect for maximising energy production.The number of petals in most flowers also follows the Fibonacci sequence: lilies have 3, buttercups 5, delphinium 8, common marigolds 13, asters 21.  But even more striking are the complex spirals of seed-heads of sunflowers, fir cones and pineapples.  In each case new seeds forming in the centre of the flower push older seeds out into mesmerising patterns of interlocking, clockwise and anticlockwise spirals.The numbers of spirals in both directions are consecutive Fibonacci numbers with 5 and 8 or 8 and 13 in pineapples, 8 and 13 in fir cones, and numbers as high as 144 and 233 recorded in sunflower heads.Why?

As with other gull species which are opportunist in diet, junk food and bits of plastic provided by us humans can be inadvertently consumed.Over many years the Gleaner oil depot, which has a concrete bund in case of oil spillage, has provided a safe nesting site for around 20 pairs. The suggestion that this colony could easily find an alternative site is perhaps wishful thinking as suitable sites nearby in Mid Argyll are already occupied by other gull species or don’t have the required habitat features.Thankfully, however, this should not prove necessary. Following a productive on-site meeting last week with the Scottish Canals\u0026#8217 environmental scientist, the project architect and TSL contractors we noted 10-15 birds sitting on eggs and unaffected by the work going on around them.Planned works over the coming weeks should not affect these gulls, Oystercatchers or Black Guillemots from nesting and will also not impede the building work which is scheduled to be completed by next spring.The Mid Argyll hub project and new canal museum will largely reflect the social and cultural heritage of the Crinan Canal, but should also encompass the important and often decreasing natural history of the Crinan Canal corridor. These breeding birds are also a part of this and should not just be something to ‘chase off’ to somewhere else.Excellent viewing and educational opportunities from the new build will be possible to watch this colony raise their chicks as well as providing a point to lookout for other wildlife on the loch.Nearby, the tidal estuary of Loch Gilp provides us with an often highly under-valued unofficial nature reserve that links Ardrishaig with Lochgilphead, which in winter hosts important numbers of duck and waders, in summer includes breeding Eider ducks and Common Terns and during migration is a vital stopping off point during adverse weather for passage Whooper swans, Brent geese and Black-tailed Godwits to name a few.Increasingly good work is being undertaken by locals and the Phoenix Trust to help clear up some of the increasing amounts of shoreline rubbish.Keep up the good work!Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,I have been out and about Islay the past week speaking to my constituents, visiting local businesses and monitoring the roads department\u0026#8217s progress with road repairs.Unfortunately CalMac management\u0026#8217s shocking handling of our local ferry service is really taking it\u0026#8217s toll on many local businesses that depend heavily of Islay\u0026#8217s growing tourist trade. We simply cannot allow CalMac to continue to make the same errors every year without consequences.On another subject, I have been unimpressed with our local roads department management\u0026#8217s sluggish response to a large number of complaints from local residents and myself about the plague of potholes scattered across Islay.There are many roads across Islay that have some potholes marked to be filled while others remain unmarked despite them in many cases being side by side. This scattershot approach to pothole repairs is as random as it is ineffective.In the future we will need to see a more long term resurfacing solution to our local roads with less short term, random and piecemeal patchwork.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,In the run up to National Volunteering Week (June 1- 7), Cats Protection would like to extend our thanks to the many thousands of volunteers throughout the country who offer their time and expertise to help cats and kittens across the UK.In 2017, our 10,200-strong volunteer network contributed an incredible 5.5 million hours, each volunteer gifting a wealth of expertise and immeasurable passion to the charity. Their dedication enabled Cats Protection to help around 200,000 cats and kittens nationwide.Cats Protection is always on the lookout for new volunteers to join the UK’s biggest cat community. Though a large part of our work is helping cats, through fostering and rehoming, our volunteers have the opportunity to become involved with a range of interesting activities such as organising fundraising events, helping with publicity or managing funds and resources to benefit the greatest amount of cats.Volunteering can offer the chance to develop skills such as time management, interpersonal skills and teamwork, making CVs much more attractive and, of course, helping cats.Anyone who is interested in becoming a volunteer can go to our website www.cats.org.uk/get- involved/volunteering  to find out more.Julie Meredith, head of volunteering development, Cats Protection,Sir,I really love being active, especially the feeling after and that’s why I’m supporting Bowel Cancer UK and Beating Bowel Cancer’s latest fundraising campaign to get sponsored to do 30 minutes of physical activity for 30 days in June.Step up for 30 is a fantastic way for you to be more physically active to reduce your risk of bowel cancer – the UK’s second biggest cancer killer. This can be anything from yoga, walking in the sunshine (I walk everywhere) or taking your favourite class at the gym.While you’re getting fitter and feeling healthier, you’ll be raising money to fund the highest quality research and essential information and support services that will save lives from bowel cancer.Take on the challenge and sign up at bowelcanceruk.org.uk/stepupfor30.Gaby Roslin, TV and radio presenterPICS:The common gull has been seen nesting at the disused oil depot. no_a21Gleanergull01Gulls at the former Gleaner site. no_a21Gleanergull02\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"lochgilphead kids get kitted out","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 30/05/18, 5:11 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowLochgilphead Soccer Centre is delighted to have taken delivery of a quality rain jacket for each of the kids associated with the centre and Red Star YFC.That’s 120 rain jackets in total.As well as making sure the kids look smart and feel part of the club they will also help keep them dry and warm when the weather is a bit wet and windy.The rain jackets have been sponsored by Mid Argyll Youth Development Services (MAYDS) and the Soccer Centre would like to say a huge thank you to MAYDS for this sponsorship and ongoing support.Five teams from Lochgilphead travelled to the Oban Football Festival on a Saturday April 28.

The most coveted item, a patchwork quilt made by rider Cathy Anderson, went for a whopping £700.The annual trip was started in 2008 by Shirley-Ann McKnight as a last tour of Scotland for fellow biker and close friend, Alyson Porter, who was suffering from cancer. Sadly, Alyson never made it to her trip and now each year the journey is retraced in celebration of her life and all those affected by cancer.Since 2008, more than 600 riders have participated, each clad with a pink mohawk courtesy of Hairy-RS, and the team has raised £347,000 for Macmillan Cancer Support.

The ‘Highway Services’ would be located at Bogend Toll near Symington and could create 30 jobs. A Shell petrol station and Londis shop are part of the vision for the site. A raft of documents have been lodged with South Ayrshire Council as part of a planning application. London-based Grove Garages is behind the proposal, which would see two buildings erected.   The company has an agreement with Shell and Londis but is still in talks to sign-up a coffee firm.  The plan includes eight fuel pumps, 11 parking spaces, two car wash bays and pumps for HGVs.  The coffee shop would have a floor space of 260sqm with 29 car spaces and a drive through at the back. A supporting statement said: “The location of the site represents an ideal opportunity for a roadside servies area to cater for the frequent tourist, haulage and commuter traffic using the A77. It said the development would ensure the “reuse of a visually and environmentally poor site in a prominent location alongside one of Scotland’s main tourist routes, the A77.”  The site used to be a field belonging to Dyke Farm. Access to the site would be from the B730 adjoining the A77 north bound carriageway. Cars could enter from the southbound carriageway through the existing flyover. Chargers would also be available for electric cars. A design and access statement said: “The proposals give back purpose to an unused site, which has potential to provide an important service to the local area and indeed the wider area. The design proposals are considered to be respectful to the local environment and are in line with local policy and guidelines. No decision has been made on the application yet.

Following a long battle with neuroblastoma, the 17-year-old died peacefully surrounded by dad Chris, mum Connie, and sister Olivia. It was a fight that captured not just the hearts and minds of Ayrshire, but the world beyond. Vanessa, who displayed courage which belied her condition, would rarely be seen without a smile on her face. For almost a decade, her name became synonymous with the fight against the aggressive cancer. Almost \u0026pound1million was raised with the aim of sending Vanessa abroad for life-saving treatment. That dream was realised and in January 2013, the family received the news they longed for – that the cancer was in remission.  Vanessa would return to school and rejoin classmates as a hugely popular figure at Marr College. Life, as normal as it could ever be, was good again for this inspirational girl. But the cancer would return and spread to Vanessa’s brain, with her family receiving the crushing news that her condition was terminal. As ever, Vanessa fought bravely until the last before she passed away just days short of her 18th birthday. Now her family are vowing that her fight will live on in her legacy. Dad Chris told the Post: “We are devastated at our loss.  “Vanessa was a huge inspiration to Connie, Olivia and I and so many more. “She achieved lots during her short but fulfilled life, she did everything she wanted to do and lived life to the full. “She never complained about anything, even though her situation was dire and she knew it. “We are privileged to have had such an inspirational and beautiful daughter.”  Vanessa’s funeral will take place on Friday, June 22 at 11.30am at Dreghorn Crematorium and then on to Troon Town Hall for a Celebration of Life. Chris added: “We’d like to ask that people wear bright colours and for the gents not to wear black ties. “That is what Vanessa would have wanted.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12539593.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/14478946.jpg","title":"lawrence shankland agrees new deal","story":"NewsLawrence Shankland agrees new deal to stay at Ayr United for Championship pushThe 29-goal striker has put pen to paper on a new deal at Somerset Park.\u0026nbspShareByStuart WilsonLochlin Highet13:14, 15 MAY 2018Updated13:18, 15 MAY 2018NewsShankland is staying on at Somerset (Image: Daily Record)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailLawrence Shankland insists money can’t buy happiness after he sensationally spurned a host of lucrative offers to pen a new deal at Ayr United.

Shankland, 22, told the Ayrshire Post: “It’s a great club to be a part of. The main thing for this decision is that I am enjoying my football. The gaffer has been great with me and that’s why I came here. He gave me a chance to get back into football. I am happy and I don’t think there’s any amount of money that beats happiness. The fans have taken to me and that gives you confidence going into every game you play. Shankland smashed 29 goals en route to being named League One\u0027s player of the year as Ayr won the title.  Boss Ian McCall said: Lawrence could have doubled his money elsewhere and had offers from the Premiership up here and League One down in England. But the affection he has had from our supporters has played a huge part in his decision. It’s a huge piece of business for this club. Be in no doubt that Lawrence could easily have gone, but he has made a footballing decision.

Dominic was diagnosed with Asperger syndrome, which is on the autism spectrum, at a young age and is part of the Great Britain Learning Disability tennis team. After three years in the sport, he is number one in the world for his doubles category and number three in the world for singles. He competes in the mainstream tennis ranks and is in the top 10 for the South/West Scotland overall. He is currently part of an apprenticeship at Prestwick Tennis Fitness Club and is close to achieving his level three coaching badges that would allow him to coach anywhere in the world.

Since then we haven’t looked back and he has became a fantastic kid.  “You would never know he had this syndrome and that’s credit to the hard work done.” Dominic decided to give something back to the charities that have helped him over the years. He climbed Goat Fell with a group of friends and raised \u0026pound810 for Bibic and South Ayrshire Autistic Society. Anthony said: “We are very proud of him. “A lot of people now do fundraising for national charities but the local ones don’t get as much exposure or sponsors.

But they’ve been caught out by golfers incensed South Ayrshire Council has not passed on any benefit of a government zero VAT ruling on leisure. In February HMRC announced there was to be no VAT on council provided leisure activities. And that will include swimming, gym use and bowling at Northfield. But South Ayrshire Council has not let any of its customers know. If effectively means golf charges have soared 24% on last year, rather than the 2.7% the council have boasted about. It means that golfers paying the \u0026pound429 season ticket price would be expecting a \u0026pound71.50 reduction for VAT.  Tory councillor Peter Convery is blasting the move as “sleekit.” And he said: “Surely people are entitled to get some money paid back to them? “This is about principle and this is sleekit. “This is peoples’ money and should never have been included in the original ticket charge. “It is very unfortunate the council cannot see this to any great extent.” In East Ayrshire, where leisure is provided by an arm’s length trust, VAT is necessary on charges. Details of the VAT grab emerged in an email between a golfer and Councillor Brian McGinley.  The golfer, who preferred to remain anonymous, said: “I do not think the majority of season ticket holders will be enamoured to discover that a significant element of their season ticket fee is actually related to a cost that SAC no longer have to bear.” Ayr East councillor McGinley said in the email: “I have ascertained that VAT has been included within the price of a season ticket up until February 18 this year. “Following a court ruling against HMRC whereby sports services provided by local authorities are now classed as exempt for VAT purposes, VAT is no longer remitted to HMRC when income is received for season tickets etc.” A council spokesman would not explain why they had not revealed the VAT windfall, if players can expect a refund or whether is was just being used to mask a huge leap in prices.  He would only say: “We work hard to ensure our golf and leisure provision continues to offer great value for local people and visitors and this is reflected in our current charging structure. “The funding from entry fees and season tickets only makes a partial contribution to our overall operating costs – with the remainder coming directly from Council subsidy – and the 2.7% price increase on last year’s fees reflects the Consumer Price Index. “Reducing inequalities within our communities is a key commitment for the Council and we have extended the concessions available under the Access to Leisure card scheme – which includes a 15% discount for all South Ayrshire residents. The change in VAT application for Council leisure services contributes towards the costs of that important scheme, which will help improve health and wellbeing across South Ayrshire, as well as helping reduce the net deficit cost of running Council leisure services, which was almost \u0026pound11 million in 2016/17.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"troon church help build new","story":"NewsTroon church to help build new school for hurricane victimsThe Troon church has raised £170,000 to help transform people’s lives in Haiti.\u0026nbspShareBySarah Hilley14:28, 7 JUN 2018NewsPastor Richard Woods with Minister Rolex visiting Muirhead Primary (Image: Copyright unknown)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email Building a school for hurricane victims was once a dream for Seagate Church.

This must have been a favoured site well-placed beside a coaching inn on the main road North.\nThe 1860s saw the further development of the railways begun five years previously.\nBefore this Peebles lived up to its reputation of being, \u0026ldquoAs quiet as the grave or as Peebles. With the railways came industry and people and money.\nCommercial Peebles began to develop and the Northgate was no exception. Up until then the Northgate was little more than the road out of town with several pastoral tofts strung out along it. Laird Girdwood, was a larger-than-life character and also one of the prominent proprietors. He was also a member of the Peeblesshire Rifle Volunteers.\nThen as now, such organisations accommodate a little social networking.\nIt is not surprising then that Charles Ker, also a Volunteer and his sister acquired one of these tofts from a comrade. Meanwhile James Ker lived with his wife at Red Lion House in Biggiesknowe. Their toft was more than half an acre in size with a barn whose gable end faced the street and a single-storey cottage attached. Parts of the barn were rebuilt\ninto a new dwelling house.\nThe barn itself is not without interest being the one scene of Laird Girdwood\u0026rsquos Venison Feast to which all the residents of the Northgate were invited everyone, however, to bring his own beverage.\nIt was a resounding success\u0026mdash\u0026ldquoNever before did the rafters ring with such glee. was the reported account of the event.\nA traditional forge and a modern purpose-built engineering workshop were built as well as a \u0026lsquospec\u0026rsquo tenement of four dwellings.\nWrought iron work was much in evidence, with a large garden behind and a rustic rockery at the front of the property. It was then given the name \u0026lsquoKer Place\u0026rsquo after the fashion of the time for such businessmen of which there are several examples in Peebles.\nThe cottage (pre 1823), which is still in place, became part of the enterprise and judging by the size of the lathe bed and fire-scorched rafters some serious work went on there.\nIt also incorporated James Ker\u0026rsquos dispensary for his veterinary work. James had been a student of William Dick at his Edinburgh Veterinary College which he had established at his father\u0026rsquos forge in Clyde Street in Edinburgh where the bus station now stands.\nHe obtained his diploma to practice as a veterinary surgeon and was also made a Fellow of the Edinburgh Medical Veterinary Society for his \u0026ldquovaluable contribution to veterinary science. This may have been in connection with a product he sold commercially as \u0026lsquoKer\u0026rsquos Alterative Sheep Pill\u0026rsquo.\nIt must have been effective since it was still being sold in the 1930s by his son, John Ker. He, also a blacksmith, had qualified as a veterinary surgeon nearly forty years after his father at what was by then called the Royal \u0026ldquoDick Veterinary College.\nJames and his wife died at a young age and his brother and sister, Charles and Elizabeth, carried on the business successfully as well as raising James\u0026rsquos family of two boys.\nJohn Ker, as said, served his apprenticeship as a blacksmith and also qualified as a veterinary surgeon. About 1916 the smiddy closed when the farriers went to war.\nJohn Ker served as a captain with the Royal Army Veterinary Corps and on his return practiced locally as a veterinary surgeon until he died after a short illness towards the end of 1938. The smiddy, itself, \u0026ldquodid its bit during hostilities, by billeting troops.\nIt did not reopen after the war and operate at its former level of business as blacksmiths and engineers. It did, however, remain in general use and is currently a joiner\u0026rsquos workshop.\nJohn Ker was also the last \u0026ldquoBoxmaster (minute secretary) of the Peebles Incorporation of Hammermen\u0026mdashthe blacksmiths\u0026rsquo once exclusive and powerful guild.\nIt fell to him to record in the minutes, rather regretfully, \u0026ldquoThere was no meeting and no dinner held in 1927\u0026mdashfitting, his forebear had been one of the founding signatories we believe. Times had changed, the calling had lost its prosperous and confident ambience, and that was a fact.\nThese events resonate with the story of Black Beauty\u0026rsquos life over a hundred years ago in Victorian England.\nSome of his memories were happy and some were very sad, none less so than those when he meets his old friend Ginger . . .\n"},{"url":null,"title":"40 week one-way system introduced in Jedburgh","story":"A TEMPORARY one-way system has been in introduced in Jedburgh to allow work to be carried out to a privately-owned dangerous building.\nThe new arrangement, which began on Monday (June 4), has seen a section of the High Street become one-way southbound from Jewellers Wynd to Canongate southbound, and a section of Exchange Street one-way northbound from High Street to Friarsgate.\nThis one-way system is required to extend scaffolding onto the road to allow for repairs to be carried out to the building, which has significant structural issues and needs extensive work to make it safe.\nThe disruption is expected to last 40 weeks, and a temporary walkway has also been introduced around the scaffolding to allow pedestrians to still use High Street and Exchange Street.\nSignage is in place to make people aware of the temporary arrangement.\nA joint statement by Jedburgh and District councillors Jim Brown, Scott Hamilton, Sandy Scott said: \u0026ldquoThe High Street dangerous building is a complex and long running issue, but the council is making progress and needs to introduce this temporary one-way system to carry out further repairs.\n\u0026ldquoThe council is looking at various options for the future of the building, and a report is expected to be discussed later this year.\n\u0026ldquoWe thank townsfolk for their patience so far, and would ask they comply with the temporary one-way system.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"Borders parking issues working group calls for evidence from public","story":"A CALL for evidence on parking issues in Borders town centres has been issued by Scottish Borders Council\u0026rsquos Parking Issues Working Group.\nThe working group is currently gathering evidence and researching what happens in other local authority areas and will report back to the Executive Committee later this year with recommendations.\nAn online survey has now been launched to give local people and businesses the opportunity to provide evidence of any issues faced in their communities.\nCouncillor Gordon Edgar, Executive Member for Roads and Infrastructure and chair of the working group, said: \u0026ldquoAs part of our evidence gathering we want to hear from people on specific places, days and times when parking is a problem.

Kremlin links","story":"Millionaire Brexit backer Arron\u0026nbspBanks is facing calls to explain his links with the Kremlin following reports that his contacts were far more extensive than previously acknowledged.\nThe Leave.EU founder, who helped bankroll Nigel Farage\u0026rsquos campaign, held a series of undisclosed meetings with Russian embassy officials around the time of the 2016 referendum campaign, according to the Sunday Times.\nThe paper said it had seen emails showing he also discussed a potential business deal involving six Russian gold mines with ambassador Alexander Yakovenko after being introduced to him by a suspected Russian spy.\nThe head of the parliamentary inquiry into \u0026ldquofake news, Conservative MP Damian Collins, said the report raised serious questions about Russian interference in UK politics.\nRussian ambassador Alexander Yakovenko (Kirsty O\u0026rsquoConnor/PA)\n\u0026ldquoThe question I think people will want answered is did Mr Banks profit out of these meetings? he told BBC1\u0026rsquos Sunday Politics programme.\n\u0026ldquoDid that happen? Did he make money out of it and did he use that money to fund his campaigns?\n\u0026ldquoRussia has a track record of interfering in the politics of other countries. It does it in a variety of ways. That is why it is important we understand the level of contact and involvement there was here.\nAsked about the report at the G7 summit in Quebec on Saturday, Theresa May said: \u0026ldquoI am sure that if there are any allegations that need investigation the proper authorities will do that.\nMr Collins confirmed that Mr Banks has agreed to give evidence to the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee as planned on Tuesday, having previously announced he was pulling out, accusing the MPs of conducting a \u0026ldquowitch hunt.\nDamian Collins says Russia has a track record of interfering in the politics of other countries (PA)\nThe Sunday Times said emails it had seen from Mr Banks and Leave.EU communications chief Andy Wigmore showed they had repeated contacts with Russian officials to discuss matters of mutual interest throughout the EU referendum campaign and its aftermath.\nIt said they showed Mr Banks met Mr Yakovenko three times \u0026ndash having previously only acknowledged one encounter in 2015 \u0026ndash and made a visit to Moscow in February 2016 in the midst of the referendum campaign.\nThe paper said he and Mr Wigmore also had lunch with the ambassador in November 2016, three days after they and Mr Farage had met Donald Trump in New York following his victory in the US presidential election.\nThey were said to have been introduced to Mr Yakovenko by Alexander Udod \u0026ndash one of 23 suspected Russian intelligence officers subsequently ejected from the UK after the poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal in Salisbury.\nThe ambassador was said to have proposed a business deal that would have involved them in the consolidation into one company of six Russian gold mines.\nThe emails were passed to the Sunday Times by journalist Isabel Oakeshott, Mr Banks\u0026rsquos ghostwriter on The Bad Boys Of Brexit, who is writing a book with Tory peer Lord Ashcroft on Russia\u0026rsquos use of \u0026ldquohybrid warfare to influence British politics.\nThe paper said she came forward after she said her email accounts were hacked.\nMr Banks dismissed the claims, telling the paper: \u0026ldquoI had two boozy lunches with the Russian ambassador and another cup of tea with him. Bite me. It\u0026rsquos a convenient political witch-hunt, both over Brexit and Trump.\nHe told the paper nothing came of their discussions over the gold mine deal. \u0026ldquoWe didn\u0026rsquot profit from any business deals because I never pursued anything, he said.\nMr Banks, whose wife is Russian, acknowledged he made a \u0026ldquofamily trip to Moscow in February 2016, but said \u0026ldquono meetings were had with anyone.\nHe told the paper he had also disclosed details of his contacts with the Russians to US officials.\n\u0026ldquoWe actually saw the suits from the American embassy who introduced us to the State Department to explain what had happened and then we briefed the Americans on our meetings with the Russians, he said.\nMr Wigmore told the paper: \u0026ldquoWe never offered any information to him (Mr Yakovenko) or any Russian any details of our (Brexit) campaign.\nThere was no immediate response from Leave.EU.\n(function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i[\u0027GoogleAnalyticsObject\u0027]=ri[r]=i[r]||function(){(i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date()a=s.createElement(o),m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0]a.async=1a.src=gm.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m)})(window,document,\u0027script\u0027,\u0027//www.google-analytics/analytics.js\u0027,\u0027ga\u0027)ga(\u0027create\u0027, \u0027UA-72310761-1\u0027, \u0027auto\u0027, {\u0027name\u0027: \u0027pacontentapi\u0027})ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027referrer\u0027, location.origin)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027dimension1\u0027, \u0027By Gavin Cordon, Press Association Whitehall Editor\u0027)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027dimension2\u0027, \u00272aa3fa0b-14e3-4384-a9f1-80a1fbce76e3\u0027)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027dimension3\u0027, \u0027paservice:news,paservice:news:uk\u0027)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027dimension6\u0027, \u0027story\u0027)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027dimension7\u0027, \u0027composite\u0027)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027dimension8\u0027, null)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027dimension9\u0027, null)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.send\u0027, \u0027pageview\u0027, { \u0027location\u0027: location.href, \u0027page\u0027: (location.pathname + location.search + location.hash), \u0027title\u0027: \u0027Brexit backer Arron Banks facing questions over Kremlin links\u0027})\n"},{"url":null,"title":"letter dalintober beach clean","story":"Trudy Kennedy: \u0026#8216What a difference it made, great way to spend an hour or so.\u0026#8217Arlene Maclean: \u0026#8216Dalintober looking lovely in the sun.

It might make you laugh.Somewhere along the line, in the last five or six years, the world seems to have developed a serious crack in its funny bone.And I do mean serious, no crack intended.And there I go again, being flippant, trying to raise a smile in one or two readers, even if it might resemble a risus sardonicus. (It’s how people on Sardinia used to grin, that’s why.)It’s a congenital condition – like my idiocy, claims my wife– that ever since I was young I made outrageous statements and people would say to me: \u0026#8216You can’t be serious.\u0026#8217 \u0026#8216Not on a regular basis, no,\u0026#8217 was my usual reply.For the greater part of my 70-odd years, while laughter was still an acceptable knee-jerk reaction to almost anything, I prospered, in a vaguely penniless way, as a freelance writer of would-be humorous journalism.Nothing too fancy, no slipping on banana skins, but not rocket science either.  (Although the rotation of the Earth really makes my day.)In retrospect, I see now that my humour wasn’t serious enough. It had no underlying message.  It had no sociological content.  It was not of the variety that allowed people to feel wise, nod wisely, and say something wise, like: \u0026#8216Very wise…\u0026#8217The mistakes of the past – of my past – included trying to make people lose control and laugh aloud, rather than just being able to smirk knowingly at my cleverness, if I ever was.We live in a much more buttoned-up, uptight and insecure society than we used to (do you feel my sociological message approaching?) and it has affected the sort of things we feel we are permitted to laugh at, or not permitted to laugh at.Scorn and ridicule can no longer be directed at certain people with impunity – the dishonourable exception being bankers and politicians, of course, who are still fair game, and rightly so, even if out on bail and technically innocent because they haven’t been charged yet.But when did you last hear a blitz of jokes from a television comedian about a small, ethnic, obese, female bishop, even if she was his mother-in-law?Don’t worry, the news isn’t all bad, and I can report that sometimes outbreaks of laughter can occur in the most unusual places – Dundee, for example – and at the most unexpected times.Not long ago I saw a funeral procession led by a slow-marching, black-suited chaplain who was laughing his head off as he walked along in front of the hearse.As I watched in amazement, his happy demeanour began to affect his slow progress, which became a sprightly strut, and it seemed at any moment he might twirl his top hat in his hands, or even produce a rabbit from it.Only when I caught sight of the wireless device attached to his ear did I guess he was probably listening to dance music on a radio earbud. Death is no respecter of parsons.Let’s hope the worst extremes of political correctness will gradually fade away, as common sense brings a return to humorous nonsense, and seriousness wilts in the face of jocularity.A life without laughter?You must be joking.David Aitken,Dundee.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"flags fly as putting green opens","story":"There are 18 holes on the seaside green next to the children\u0026#8217s play park and staff also have three play tents, mats for younger children and a small selection of safe toys.South Kintyre Development Trust (SKDT) which manages the attraction has putters to suit all heights and a scorecard is provided.At the end of May SKDT was awarded £75,000 from the Big Lottery Fund (BLF).A BLF press release stated: \u0026#8216This funding will enable the organisation to not only continue but develop their activities at Campbeltown village hall.\u0026#8217At the opening were South Kintyre Development Trust\u0026#8217s Shaun Brown,  putting green staff Tina Chestnut and Peter Lusher with Morag McMillan. 25_c23puttinggreen01Baby Julia Skibinska, 11 months, was happy to play by the putting green. 25_c23puttinggreen02Cate McMillan, 11 months, chewed on some plastic ice cream. 25_c23puttinggreen03\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letter mok run thankyou","story":"The continued outstanding success of Mok Run race weekend is a reflection of the ever-increasing dedication and commitment its hard working committee, community volunteers, local businesses, enthusiastic runners and crowd supporter’s display year after year.On behalf of myself and the Mok Run committee I would like to say a massive thank you to those who contributed their free time and energy to make this happen for the 13th consecutive year.Each year we are given tremendous support from many individuals and organisations listed here and this is very much appreciated.Sincere thanks to: Campbeltown Co-op, Wee Toon Sports , McFadyens, Mach Dunes, Tunnocks, AM Transport, Argyll Bakeries, Seafield Hotel, Campbeltown Pottery, Kintyre Agricultural Society,  Jim Martin Supplies, Killegruer Caravan Site, Machrihanish Holiday Park, Glen Scotia, Spring Bank, Beinn An Tuirc, Live Argyll,  Stewart Balfour and Sutherland, Campbeltown Running Club, Jogscotland and Wee Toon Warriors.By supporting this event, you have made a concrete contribution to the greater community.I would also like to extend my grateful thanks to: all the MOK Run committee members who work tirelessly behind the scenes our race marshals \u0026#8211 without whom this event would not happen race sweepers  race day commentator Councillor John Armour Gavin Reid Johnny Durnan David McMillan Willie Ralston Barrs Clochkeil Councillor Donald Kelly Argyll and Bute Council amenities team Campbeltown Police Office Southend Scouts Campbeltown\u0026#8217s: Young Fire Fighters Coastguard Sea Cadets Police Scotland Youth Volunteers massage therapists Brass Band Kintyre Schools Pipe Band West Coast EMT Jamie G  South Kintyre Sports Council \u0026#8211 for making our legendary post race ceilidh such a success Dalintober primary pupils for their motivational posters to our photographers: John McFadyen Campbeltown Courier\u0026#8217s Mark Davey Kenny Craig and Greg and Norma Grogan for capturing the spirit of the weekend Fiona and Donna Robertson and all the Junior MOK Run volunteers and to many of our other volunteers who took the time to help on race day.Apologies if I have missed anyone.A special thank you once again goes to the residents of Limecraigs, for taking the time to decorate the street, provide well received ‘showers’ along with the local fire brigade ‘shower’ who came out in full force to cheer the runners on in the final leg of the 10K route.As one runner summed it up on our facebook page: \u0026#8216Fantastic day !\u0026#8216Thanking all the organisers, marshals, water-givers, water-hosers, sweety-givers, pipers, drummers, sandwich and pastry makers, and everyone else involved.

Persimmon Homes is hoping to get the go-ahead \u0026ldquoin principle from East Lothian Council for the mixed-use development, which includes a commercial hub with hotel, retail facilities and cafe/restaurant.  Community facilities such as a residential neighbourhood centre, playing fields, changing facilities and public parks are proposed.  Also planned is the construction of a grade-separated junction on the A1, roads and foot/cycle paths, as well as improvement to the Musselburgh rail halt.  Submission of the planning application in principle follows a Proposal of Application Notice and public consultation exercise for the major scheme, which included an exhibition on the draft masterplan at The Brunton last year.  A planning statement from Holder Planning, acting for Persimmon, read: \u0026ldquoThe application site is allocated for the mixed use development proposed in the soon-to-be adopted East Lothian Local Development Plan.  \u0026ldquoThe proposed development will deliver 1,500 homes across the site. These homes will comprise a range of housing types. Twenty-five per cent of the housing provision will be affordable as defined by the council.  \u0026ldquoA primary school is proposed that will accommodate the requirements arising from residential development on the wider site. It is located centrally in the application site within walking distance of new homes via a network of paths that offer safe and convenient links. The detailed design will be in accordance with the requirements of the education authority, East Lothian Council.  \u0026ldquoThe masterplan proposes enhancing a pedestrian link under the A1 that will link the site areas together, allowing new neighbourhoods and services to the west, identified in the wider masterplan, to gain access to Musselburgh Station and services in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoThe proposal incorporates a significant network of multi-functional open spaces and semi-natural landscape areas, including allotments/community growing space, natural play areas, sports pitches and outdoor gym facilities, and seating. This framework of green space will contribute to the legibility of the neighbourhood\u0026rsquos spatial pattern, establishing distinct areas of new housing linked together via a network of green foot and cycle routes.  A new research and innovation quarter for East Lothian offering more than 20 hectares of new commercial space is proposed.  The planning statement added: \u0026ldquoWith strong links to the adjacent Queen Margaret University, the site offers the potential to build upon the reputation of Edinburgh and the Lothians for its research and innovation.  Barry Turner, spokesman for Musselburgh Conservation Society, said: \u0026ldquoThe issue at Craighall is that major development here will be very close to major development in Edinburgh at Newcraighall and in Midlothian at Shawfair, turning the whole area into a cross-boundary urban sprawl and effectively an extension to Edinburgh\u0026rsquos built-up area.  Predicting that the plan for 1,500 houses would be approved, given that was the number in the Local Development Plan, he added: \u0026ldquoAll that we can hope for is that conditions will be put in place to make this amount of housing as acceptable as possible in terms of layout, design, amenities and access to walking and cycling routes and to public transport.  \u0026ldquoOf note is that the secondary-age children here will have to get to Musselburgh Grammar School, which is some distance away and not an easy walk, certainly not from the other side of the A1.  \u0026ldquoThe recently promoted Active Travel Network shows no cycle link to Musselburgh Grammar School. We are worried about the prospect of increased car usage to get kids to and from school thus adding to the gradually worsening traffic problems in the town.  Jim Kirkpatrick, managing director of Persimmon Homes East Scotland, said: \u0026ldquoWe have had extensive engagement with East Lothian Council and the local community prior to the application being lodged and have generally been encouraged by the positive response to our masterplan.  \u0026ldquoThe comments of Musselburgh Conservation Society are noted and we believe the issues raised are addressed in the suite of information provided to the council.  \u0026ldquoThe application is fully compliant with the proposals contained within the emerging East Lothian Local Development Plan and we look forward to working with officers and other stakeholders during the determination process."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7864264.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"SEPA water quality report  how clean is the water at your beach ","story":"              A MUSSELBURGH beach has been branded \u0026lsquopoor\u0026rsquo for its water quality in a report by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA).

Plans put forward by Dears Pharmacy were turned down by Lothian Health Board at a meeting last month.  A three-person Pharmacy Practices Committee (PPC) panel, chaired by East Lothian councillor Fiona O\u0026rsquoDonnell, unanimously refused the application.  The decision notice, published on NHS Lothian\u0026rsquos website, said that there were \u0026ldquono gaps in the existing provision of services within the neighbourhood as the other pharmacies in the area could provide the full range of pharmaceutical services.  For village residents, that means a trip to Gullane or Haddington.  The report adds: \u0026ldquoThe committee also noted that consultations by telephone were offered by one of the pharmacies in the area.  \u0026ldquoIt was also noted that extended hours provision was offered by Asda at The Jewel on the east side of Edinburgh, a distance of only 13 miles.  It also stated that there was a \u0026ldquohigh level of car ownership in the village and that public transport links were \u0026ldquogood, meaning residents could travel to other pharmacies.  However, the decision has been criticised by Dears Pharmacy and East Lothian MSP Iain Gray.  He said: \u0026ldquoI supported the application for a pharmacy, both because there is none in the village and because it could help keep the Post Office.  \u0026ldquoI was very disappointed with the decision to refuse it. I understand that there are laid-down criteria to be followed but in my view they must be wrong because they led to the wrong decision in this case.  \u0026ldquoI remain convinced that the people of Aberlady would benefit from a pharmacy without having to travel to Gullane, and have promised to support the application again if there is an appeal.  \u0026ldquoI will also be writing to the chief pharmacist and NHS Lothian about my concerns that the process is flawed.  Mahyar Nickkho-Amiry, operations director at Dears, confirmed to the Courier they would appeal the decision.  He described the decision as \u0026ldquoactive discrimination against village residents, adding: \u0026ldquoIt is a slap to the people of Aberlady. Because this is an affluent area, people are being forced to drive to Gullane or Haddington, whereas if the village was less affluent they would have stood more of a chance.  He said that had the proposals been approved, the pharmacy would have brought jobs to the village.  Donald Hay, chairman of Gullane Area Community Council, also criticised the decision.  He said: \u0026ldquoCommunity responses were not taken into account and the net result is the village could end up with no banking facilities, no Post Office and no pharmacy.  \u0026ldquoIt makes bleak reading for the village for the future.  The petition has gathered more than 700 signatures online since it was created.  Those who sign are also asked to give reasons online and Gary Hitchen wrote: \u0026ldquoI find it impossible to understand how this can have been refused.  \u0026ldquoThe provision of a pharmacy in Aberlady can only be a good thing and if it also ensures the future of the Post Office that is an added bonus.  \u0026ldquoVillages are being destroyed and turned into commuter satellites by local businesses closing \u0026ndash please don\u0026rsquot let Aberlady be next.

Between April 1 last year and the end of March 2018, 2,006 three-day emergency food supplies were given to local people.  Excluding holidays and weekends, it means that, on average, between eight and 10 food parcels are handed out Monday to Friday by the charity.  The number of three-day emergency food supplies distributed rose by 12 per cent from the previous year.  The figure mirrors what is happening across the UK, which has shown a 13 per cent increase in food parcels given out.  In 2017-2018 benefit changes/delays accounted for 757 East Lothian cases with 1,666 people affected, including 617 children. In addition, 595 cases were referred for emergency food due to being refused a crisis grant, affecting 937 people, of which 253 were under the age of 16.  A total of 31,604 kilos of food was given out last year by the county\u0026rsquos foodbank, with 50,292kgs donated.

East Lothian MSP Iain Gray condemned the figures, saying: \u0026ldquoThese shocking figures underline the fact that problems with changes to the benefits system have made a significant contribution to the rise in foodbank referrals.  \u0026ldquoGovernments at Holyrood and Westminster can no longer sit back and accept the ever increasing number of people being forced to use foodbanks.

Now Hargreaves, which is behind the proposals, is looking to create an access to the site off the roundabout to the north of the A1 at Bankton Junction.

Other works are planned for the junction, which links the A1 with the A198.

Riverside was also looking at different options as to how to more effectively manage phone calls at the volume it was receiving, he said.  Mr Beattie said: \"I have encouraged the practice to expedite the introduction of the online appointment booking system, which I feel will have the greatest and quickest effect on the experience of patients contacting the surgery.\"  He also raised the concerns of patients who might have to speak to multiple staff over a period before they were dealt with.  \"Clearly a single point of contact who can immediately direct the patient to the correct destination would be cheaper for the surgery and more efficient and less frustrating for the patient,\" added Mr Beattie."},{"url":null,"title":"Fund in memory of much-missed Jess Mackie helping others","story":"              A MEMORIAL fund set up following the tragic death of a caring 14-year-old girl is on target to reach \u0026pound10,000 raised.  Jess Mackie\u0026rsquos family created the fund in her name after the Gullane youngster, who loved to sing and help others, passed away suddenly on January 2 this year.  The North Berwick High School pupil was a member of the National Youth Choir of Scotland and sang with Aberlady and Gullane Parish Churches, at care homes and for charities, and at school concerts.  Despite her young age, she had a sense of how music could help people in need.  And now the Jess Mackie Memorial Fund will \u0026ldquohelp her to keep helping others, as she had always done, and would have continued to do if she was still with us, said parents Michael and Jackie.  \u0026ldquoWe cannot let our beautiful daughter\u0026rsquos name and character be forgotten, they said. \u0026ldquoShe had so much to offer.  All monies raised will be used to provide support and comfort through music therapy at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Edinburgh.  Dad Michael, long-standing chairman of Gullane Sports Development Trust, said: \u0026ldquoWhen Jess passed away, we had a memorial service for her and decided to use it to donate to the Edinburgh Children\u0026rsquos Hospital Charity. Quickly thereafter, we learnt about an initiative involving music therapy they were running with Tinderbox Orchestra in the hospital. We met with one of the trustees initially and we decided to put in place something that would allow Jess to help other kids.  The memorial service, which was held at Aberlady Parish Church, raised more than \u0026pound2,000, with money continuing to be donated by members of the public and through organised events.  Michael, 52, said: \u0026ldquoWe were approached by Gullane and Aberlady Parish Churches and they asked if they could run an event in Jess\u0026rsquo memory, which they did last Sunday.  \u0026ldquoFrom the family point of view, it was another show of overwhelming support by the village and the community. We have raised a substantial amount of money. Gullane and Aberlady Parish Churches posted on Facebook that it had raised about \u0026pound1,800 for the fund and Gullane Athletic [FC] are running an event in August in support of the fund.  Twelve members of staff at North Berwick High School also took part in the recent Edinburgh Marathon Relay.  Split into three teams, they raised more than \u0026pound1,500 for The Royal Hospital for Sick Children Jess Mackie Memorial Fund, Richmond\u0026rsquos Hope and Leuchie House.  Jess, who was in S3 at the secondary school, was, like her twin sister Lauren, a keen singer.  Her dad told the Courier Jess \u0026ldquoloved singing and tried to help people and raise their spirits through her voice.  That love of singing and trying to help people has been mirrored through the success of the memorial fund, which sits at about \u0026pound9,800.  Michael added: \u0026ldquoI think that the fund reflects Jess completely. It reflects the impact she had while only 14 years old.  \u0026ldquoIt reflects the impact she had on people that she met and what she did in terms of her church singing, singing in local care homes, school concerts, helping out at various events like for the Bethany Christian Trust and Leuchie House. I think that reflects what she did while she was here.  The project aims to ensure children and young people who are feeling vulnerable in hospital are given the chance to enjoy music, which can have an enormous and positive impact, helping ignite a spark in them and giving them back a sense of control.  Michael added: \u0026ldquoMusic is a great comforter at times and what Tinderbox do is amazing for the kids.  \u0026ldquoWe had no hesitation in supporting what they do.  Janet Anderson, who is involved with the choirs at the two villages\u0026rsquo churches, also paid tribute to the talented teenager.  She said: \u0026ldquoI could not speak more highly of Jess.  \u0026ldquoShe did not think she had a special talent, she was just the most unassuming, normal girl you would ever meet.  \u0026ldquoShe was so pretty, so kind and so thoughtful and generous and she never thought she was anything special.

Chester, from Dunbar, is one of 13 pets, including cats, dogs and even a rat, taking part in the PDSA Pet Fit Club.  Together they weigh more than 200 kilogrammes and need to shed 75kg to reach their ideal weights.  Ten-year-old Chester, who lives with the Gilmour family on Newhouse Avenue, is looking to shift 2.6kg \u0026ndash or six pounds \u0026ndash to reach his ideal weight.  Chester, who tips the scales at 7.6kg, was gaining so much weight that his owners thought he must have an underlying medical condition. But when tests came back negative, it was clear Chester\u0026rsquos appetite and lazy ways were the root of the problem.  Owner Lisa said: \u0026ldquoWe realised everyone in the house was feeding him without knowing he\u0026rsquod already being fed, so he was getting fed by all four of us every day!  \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove tried to help him lose weight, even putting a collar on him that says \u0026lsquoDo not feed me!\u0026rsquo for the neighbours, but that hasn\u0026rsquot worked.  \u0026ldquoHe eats whatever he can find including crisps left on the floor by the kids. He even stole my dad\u0026rsquos cheesecake that was on the kitchen counter! Another time my son woke up to the sound of rattling and he was trying to claw his way into a box of chocolates.  Lisa, along with partner Lindsay and sons Rhys and Ryan, got Chester when he was just a kitten.  Now they are determined to do what they can to help their pet lose some weight and be happier.  Lisa, who works in the family newsagent, added: \u0026ldquoHe\u0026rsquos getting older now and his weight will play on his joints if we don\u0026rsquot do something to help him. He can\u0026rsquot be comfortable carrying all that weight around and we want him to be happier and healthier as he ages.  Chester\u0026rsquos six-month Pet Fit Club diet and exercise programme will be specially tailored and overseen by the vets and nurses at Edinburgh PDSA Pet Hospital.  He is up against seven dogs, including a Cavalier King Charles spaniel who once ate a set of false teeth, a cat too fat to fit through the cat flap, and a rat who is double his ideal bodyweight.  If crowned the winner, Chester will receive a year\u0026rsquos supply of pet food, a pet-friendly holiday and a pet hamper.  Kathryn Marshall, PDSA Veterinary Care Assistant, will be helping to oversee Chester\u0026rsquos diet.  She said: \u0026ldquoWith the help of PDSA and Pet Fit Club, Lisa and Chester are making the necessary diet, exercise and lifestyle changes to help get Chester down to a healthier weight.  \u0026ldquoWe will support them every step of the way over the next six months to ensure they succeed."},{"url":null,"title":"Log found at Yellowcraig beach transformed into stunning violin","story":"              A VIOLIN maker has crafted a violin from driftwood found on an East Lothian beach to help raise awareness about the environment and the plight of the oceans.

Inspectors returned to the school 12 months on from the original report for a follow-up inspection, which led to a new report being published on Tuesday.  The inspection team talked to young people at the school and worked closely with the interim headteacher Lauren Rodger, who is returning to North Berwick High School after the summer holidays.  She will be replaced by Susan Cook, currently acting headteacher at Trinity Academy, Edinburgh  Other members of staff were also spoken to, to hear about the steps the school had taken to improve on areas previously identified in the original inspection.  Education Scotland noted the following key improvements:  - The interim headteacher has provided effective leadership in taking forward work to secure improvements, including a review of the school values  - Staff have developed a range of policies to improve practice in equalities and inclusion, including a new safeguarding policy  - The recently created Pupil Support Faculty is now better placed to address the needs of young people, and those with social, emotional and behavioural needs in particular  - The school has made progress in establishing a more positive learning environment for all.  The report did note that there were still some improvements to be made.  Issues highlighted included using evidence from self-evaluation activities to ensure consistency in learning and teaching across the school reviewing the purpose of the pupil support base to ensure there was a greater focus on learning for the young people using it and ensuring there was a whole school approach to equalities and inclusion.  Fiona Robertson, head of education at East Lothian Council, praised staff at the school for their efforts.  She said: \u0026ldquoI am pleased that Education Scotland acknowledges that Knox Academy has made important progress since the last inspection, and I would like to thank all the staff and pupils for their hard work and commitment in making these improvements.  \u0026ldquoIt is really encouraging that the positive relationships between pupils and teachers, and the fact that almost all young people recognise the value of learning in their lives, was noted.  \u0026ldquoThis is a strong basis for ensuring that the school continues to be a positive learning environment for staff and pupils alike.  And she added: \u0026ldquoWe will continue to work with the school and Education Scotland to make further improvements, and to working with Susan Cook, our new headteacher, who joins the school in August.  Education Scotland will continue to work with East Lothian Council regarding the school\u0026rsquos capacity to improve and will return to carry out another inspection within 18 months."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7898185.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Thousands oppose Dunbar town centre parking charge plans","story":"              MORE than 2,000 people have signed a petition against the idea of parking charges being introduced on Dunbar High Street.  A public consultation looking at potential parking solutions throughout East Lothian came to a close last month.  Meetings and workshops were held throughout the county by East Lothian Council, including one in Dunbar Royal British Legion.  A number of suggestions were put forward, including for a disc parking system where visitors to the busy street would set a disc showing when they had parked.  Another idea being explored is parking charges \u0026ndash but that has met with the opposition of Dunbar Trades\u0026rsquo Association (DTA).  Philip Mellor, DTA chairman, said that the group \u0026ldquostrongly oppose the introduction of parking charges.  A petition, which was put in various businesses in the town, has attracted more than 2,000 signatures.  Mr Mellor added: \u0026ldquoThe DTA feel introducing parking charges to High Street and other key off-street parking areas will have a detrimental effect on our High Street and the local economy.  \u0026ldquoThe current system since the introduction of traffic wardens has already addressed concerns around space for shoppers on High Street and it now seems counterintuitive to then introduce a measure which will drive more customers away to out-of-town developments.  \u0026ldquoWhilst parking during heavy summer visitor times can be difficult, it is very few special event days where parking is congested enough to even consider parking charges viable the majority of the time parking is available and this potential charge seems to be nothing more than a money-raising exercise at the expense yet again of already-struggling independent business owners.

The Leave.EU founder, who helped bankroll Nigel Farage\u0026rsquos campaign, held a series of undisclosed meetings with Russian embassy officials around the time of the 2016 referendum campaign, according to the Sunday Times.  The paper said it had seen emails showing he also discussed a potential business deal involving six Russian gold mines with ambassador Alexander Yakovenko after being introduced to him by a suspected Russian spy.  The head of the parliamentary inquiry into \u0026ldquofake news, Conservative MP Damian Collins, said the report raised serious questions about Russian interference in UK politics.  \u0026ldquoThe question I think people will want answered is did Mr Banks profit out of these meetings? he told BBC1\u0026rsquos Sunday Politics programme.  \u0026ldquoDid that happen? Did he make money out of it and did he use that money to fund his campaigns?  \u0026ldquoRussia has a track record of interfering in the politics of other countries. It does it in a variety of ways. That is why it is important we understand the level of contact and involvement there was here.  Asked about the report at the G7 summit in Quebec on Saturday, Theresa May said: \u0026ldquoI am sure that if there are any allegations that need investigation the proper authorities will do that.  Mr Collins confirmed that Mr Banks has agreed to give evidence to the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee as planned on Tuesday, having previously announced he was pulling out, accusing the MPs of conducting a \u0026ldquowitch hunt.  The Sunday Times said emails it had seen from Mr Banks and Leave.EU communications chief Andy Wigmore showed they had repeated contacts with Russian officials to discuss matters of mutual interest throughout the EU referendum campaign and its aftermath.  It said they showed Mr Banks met Mr Yakovenko three times \u0026ndash having previously only acknowledged one encounter in 2015 \u0026ndash and made a visit to Moscow in February 2016 in the midst of the referendum campaign.  The paper said he and Mr Wigmore also had lunch with the ambassador in November 2016, three days after they and Mr Farage had met Donald Trump in New York following his victory in the US presidential election.  They were said to have been introduced to Mr Yakovenko by Alexander Udod \u0026ndash one of 23 suspected Russian intelligence officers subsequently ejected from the UK after the poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal in Salisbury.  The ambassador was said to have proposed a business deal that would have involved them in the consolidation into one company of six Russian gold mines.  The emails were passed to the Sunday Times by journalist Isabel Oakeshott, Mr Banks\u0026rsquos ghostwriter on The Bad Boys Of Brexit, who is writing a book with Tory peer Lord Ashcroft on Russia\u0026rsquos use of \u0026ldquohybrid warfare to influence British politics.  The paper said she came forward after she said her email accounts were hacked.  Mr Banks dismissed the claims, telling the paper: \u0026ldquoI had two boozy lunches with the Russian ambassador and another cup of tea with him. Bite me. It\u0026rsquos a convenient political witch-hunt, both over Brexit and Trump.  He told the paper nothing came of their discussions over the gold mine deal. \u0026ldquoWe didn\u0026rsquot profit from any business deals because I never pursued anything, he said.  Mr Banks, whose wife is Russian, acknowledged he made a \u0026ldquofamily trip to Moscow in February 2016, but said \u0026ldquono meetings were had with anyone.  He told the paper he had also disclosed details of his contacts with the Russians to US officials.  \u0026ldquoWe actually saw the suits from the American embassy who introduced us to the State Department to explain what had happened and then we briefed the Americans on our meetings with the Russians, he said.  Mr Wigmore told the paper: \u0026ldquoWe never offered any information to him (Mr Yakovenko) or any Russian any details of our (Brexit) campaign.  There was no immediate response from Leave.EU."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7706903.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Petition over Cockenzie site taken to Holyrood","story":"              PRESSURE has been piled on the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos planning minister as local politicians demanded he reverse a decision to call in plans for the former Cockenzie Power Station site.  Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard MSP last week met East Lothian Labour Party campaigners at Holyrood as they delivered a petition signed by more than 1,000 people to Kevin Stewart MSP.  While Councillor Lachlan Bruce, ward member for Preston, Seton, Gosford was joined by South of Scotland MSP Michelle Ballantyne, both Conservative, as they sent letters to Mr Stewart calling for the same action (see image inset).  The campaign comes after the minister called in a planning application by Inch Cape Offshore Ltd (ICOL) to build a substation \u0026ndash which would bring energy ashore from a planned offshore wind farm \u0026ndash on a large section of the site, which was recently purchased by East Lothian Council from ScottishPower.  That sparked cross-party condemnation from county politicians, who fear it could jeopardise local plans to create jobs and boost the economy on the site.  Mr Leonard added his signature to the Hands Off Cockenzie petition before it was submitted.  Iain Gray (Lab), East Lothian MSP said: \u0026ldquoMinisters claim the call-in is because the site is of national importance, but even the leader of the SNP Group on East Lothian Council has condemned the decision as unnecessary.  \u0026ldquoBy signing our petition in such large numbers, local people have sent a clear message they want East Lothian to decide on decisions about the future of the site.  Meanwhile, Mr Bruce said he had asked Mr Stewart to send the decision back to the council. He said: \u0026ldquoI think it is only right that this decision is made locally by the council on behalf of local residents. The people who are affected most are local residents and it is the people they elected, not a Government minister from Aberdeen, who should be making the decision.

Perhaps we have become de-sensitised to the slew of research and numbers that assault us several times a year each revealing a segment of deprivation.  One month it will be the numbers of people using foodbanks in another it will be the number of children living in poverty in yet another it will be mortality rates in our most disadvantaged neighbourhoods. Perhaps, too, we have become so impervious to the callousness of assorted Tory responses to these human catastrophes that we simply switch off. Not this time though. There was something chilling about this one.  The report, Destitution in the UK 2018, was produced by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation and identified the number of people who were pushed into destitution during 2017 while looking at causes, solutions and context in the UK. Its top line revealed that one and a half million people were destitute last year, including 365,000 children. The UK Government\u0026rsquos response was this: \u0026ldquoThe Government believes that work is the best way out of poverty.  This time it seemed they had simply given up pretending to be concerned that any attempt at displaying humanity in the face of evil was pointless. Previously there would have been a pledge to do more or a vow to meet with agencies in the field and perhaps even a half-hearted nod to some money they had invested in a skills redevelopment scheme in Camden. Now it was just a shrug as if to say: \u0026ldquoSo, what do you expect us to do about it?  It carried echoes of 1834 when the Poor Law was introduced as a response to growing resentment among the ruling classes that the indolent poor were getting too many handouts. Workhouses would instead be introduced and these would soon sort out the wheat from the chaff. So inhumane were the conditions inside these places that it was felt workshy loafers everywhere would be forced to find meaningful employment. This single scrap of legislation spurred Charles Dickens into a frenzy of creativity that produced works such as Oliver Twist and Little Dorrit.  In 21st century Britain we can easily process words and phrases such as unemployment or inequality or the poverty gap but \"destitution\" seems to belong to another era. In the time of Dickens when squalor and infant death and poverty-related disease constantly stalked the existences of society\u0026rsquos most wretched people destitution was a familiar term it was all of the above and seemed to signify a state of utter hopelessness. It is not a word you would commonly expect to find in 21st century Britain, one of the richest and best-educated nations on earth and one that last year spent more than \u0026pound2bn maintaining Trident.  In its report the Joseph Rowntree Foundation describes destitution as being unable to afford the bare essentials that we all need to eat, stay warm and dry, and keep clean. \u0026ldquoPeople experiencing long-term poverty, it points out \u0026ldquowere typically tipped into destitution by harsh debt recovery practices (mainly by public authorities and utilities companies) benefit delays, gaps and sanctions financial and other pressures associated with poor health and disability high costs of housing, fuel and other essentials and, for some migrants, extremely low levels of benefits or no eligibility for benefits at all. It\u0026rsquos reasonable to suggest that Dickens might have expected most of these evils to have disappeared in the course of two centuries, not least because two years earlier the Great Reform Act had set the UK on a long course towards universal suffrage.  The figure of 1.5m destitute is down from 1.7m two years previously but if you think the numbers are heading in the right direction think again: the consequences of Universal Credit have yet to be measured. As we have seen, the Tory response to this was essentially: \u0026ldquoGet a job. This ignores the reality of unpaid carers being forced to give up work to care for sick relatives. It also fails to take account of the numbers of households suffering from the effects of in-work poverty. Last year research conducted by Cardiff University found that a record 60% of people in poverty live in a household where someone is in work. Families in the woefully under-regulated private rental sector were deemed most at risk. The refusal of the great majority of firms to pay the Living Wage is also a contributory factor after two decades where real wages have constantly lagged behind inflation.  Underlying the callousness of the Hard Right towards the poor is the view that benefits are handouts, free money that it pains them to disburse. They are nothing of the sort. Benefits have mainly been bought and paid for by those who receive them when they were in work or by previous generations of their families. They have been earned. In contrast, the UK loses billions each year because the hardest work ever undertaken by rich Tory donors is in finding ways to avoid paying taxes.  The Rowntree report came at the end of a week in which the taxpayer took a \u0026pound2bn hit with the sell-off of part of the Royal Bank of Scotland. When the sell-off is complete we will have lost close to the \u0026pound27bn we were assured we would gain by taking control of RBS. This was Alistair Darling\u0026rsquos great \u0026lsquotriumph\u0026rsquo. His former boss Gordon Brown was also wheeled out this week, channelling his inner Nigel Farage by railing against the migrants as he reprised his desperate British jobs for British workers theme from 2007.  In this exchange in Dickens\u0026rsquo Christmas Carol, published in 1843, Ebenezer Scrooge encounters a group of charity collectors in the company of the Spirit of Christmas Present.  Ebenezer: But have they no refuge, no resource?  Spirit of Christmas Present: [quoting Scrooge] Are there no prisons? Are there no workhouses?  First Collector: At this festive time of year, Mr. Scrooge, it is more than usually desirable that we should make some slight provision for the poor and destitute.  Not long ago we would have dismissed the notion of food banks let alone mass destitution in 21st century Britain. How long before an enterprising Tory proposes a return of the Poor Law, secure in the knowledge that food banks and destitution flourish and no one lifts a finger in protest?"},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/7899748.jpg?type=article-full","title":"King Kenny becomes a knight as more than 100 Scots get Queen s Birthday honours","story":"              He thought it was a demand from the taxman.

Former Lord Mayor of Liverpool Steve Rotherham MP told fans at an Anfield memorial service in 2011 that the families had asked him to table an Early Day Motion to make the request.    He helped ensure the club was represented at all of the fans\u0027 funerals and attended many of them in person.  Mr Rotherham, who is now  Mayor for the Liverpool City Region, said at the time: \"People are commemorated for their services to national sport, Sir Bobby Robson for instance, charitable causes, and Kenny and Marina [his wife)] have had a very successful charity \u0026ndash the Marina Dalglish Breast Cancer Appeal \u0026ndash which has opened a new radiotherapy centre in Fazakerley hospital.

So he has done all three.  \"It would definitely be of benefit to the Hillsborough families. While it is recognition for Kenny Dalglish himself, the families are quite clear that any individual award to him would reflect on the 96 as well and the work he has done on their behalf.  \"It nearly broke him. He and Marina went to five funerals in one day. Whilst they were counselling people there might, in hindsight, perhaps have been someone to counsel Kenny and Marina and that didn\u0027t happen.\"    In talking about the award Dalglish, made an MBE in 1984 for services to football, used \u0027we\u0027 throughout - specifically referring to himself and his wife but also the wider family.  His team won the highly-emotional all-Merseyside final in the year of Hillsborough - a day Dalglish identifies as the stand-out moment of his career.  \"For me, that is the most important memory,\" he said.

Fee discounts were believed to be for pupils from modest backgrounds, but independent schools have a financial cut-off point that includes higher earners.  Ross Greer, the education spokesperson for the Scottish Greens, said the revelations called into question the charitable status enjoyed by the schools, which comes with lucrative tax breaks. \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos utterly ridiculous to offer bursaries to the richest 10 per cent of families and continue to claim that your bursary programme shows your commitment to the charitable purpose of supporting those on low incomes. Elitist education is not and should not be seen as a charitable activity, allowing it to enjoy significant tax breaks, he said.  However John Edward, director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools, said: \u0026ldquoGross family income is one of the measures tested \u0026ndash of course school fees are a post-tax cost, and families often have more than one child they are seeking to place. The independent sector would like nothing more than the availability of high-value bursaries to be better known and more widely accessed \u0026ndash as the results speak for themselves.  Around 30,000 children and young people attend independent schools north of the border, accounting for nearly five per cent of pupils. Many of the institutions are classed as charities by virtue of meeting a statutory test that involves providing \u0026ldquopublic benefit. In the case of private schools, the public benefit is linked to the \u0026pound31m they spend on means-tested assistance for families who could not otherwise afford the full fees. However, an analysis by this newspaper has found that the eligibility for support in some cases is so wide that it includes affluent families.  Hutchesons\u0026rsquo Grammar in Glasgow, which charges up to \u0026pound12,168 a year, has a means-tested bursary fund, but it is parents whose joint income exceeds \u0026pound65,000 who are \u0026ldquounlikely to be successful. Kelvinside Academy uses the same figure. Glasgow Academy, which charges up to \u0026pound12,384 a year for its services, is also \u0026ldquounlikely to be able to help parents with a bursary if they earn over \u0026pound65,000, but the figure rises to \u0026pound75,000 for two children. Similarly, Edinburgh-based George Heriot\u0027s stipulates that total gross household income must not be above \u0026pound58,000 a year for \u0026ldquoHeriot bursary applicants.  The figures are adjusted to take account of additional children in the family and, in common with other schools, eligibility also looks at capital assets.  George Watson\u0026rsquos College (GWC), a day school, said means-tested support is calculated on a sliding scale based on savings, capital and gross household income, with the income part stretching to families on \u0026pound60,000 a year if they have one child.  However, of the 184 pupils who received support in the current school year at GWC, 37 received a 100 per cent bursary, the gross income threshold for which was \u0026pound15,000 a year. In the same group, 56 per cent of the 184 pupils benefited from 51-99 per cent fee support, which can only be given if the income threshold is between \u0026pound15,001 to \u0026pound33,000 a year.  Other schools do not have any income cut-off point for applicants seeking means-tested support. Fettes College in Edinburgh, which can charge \u0026pound33,480 for boarders, considers a range of variables when assessing applications, such as cash savings, cost of living and the number of children.  Asked whether the school would consider an application if the parents earned either \u0026pound60,000, \u0026pound80,000 or \u0026pound100,000, a Fettes spokesman said: \u0026ldquoThe figures you mention could all potentially be considered but this very much depends on the variables outlined.  Dr John Halliday, Rector of the High School of Dundee, said his school also considered a range of factors: \u0026ldquoIn all cases the level of a bursary is determined by the extent of financial need and therefore applicants are required to complete an application form which provides details of their income and capital. Where there is no financial need, no bursary will be granted.  Lord Foulkes, a Labour peer who has been critical of private schools, said he had been under the impression means-tested assistance was for the disadvantaged. He said: \u0026ldquoThis makes the bursary system looks ridiculous and undermines the whole basis of schools getting charitable status. It is manifest nonsense and the sooner the charity regulator realises this, the better.  SNP MP Tommy Sheppard, whose Edinburgh constituency includes private schools, said: \"I have always been of the view that charitable status for private schools is a balance sheet exercise, where the tax breaks exceed the bursaries given to low-income families.\"  Scottish Council of Independent Schools director Edward, whose organisation represents private schools, said: \u0026ldquoEvery school has been ramping up their means-tested fee assistance in recent years. The overall amount is three times what it was, for the same amount of pupils. There are hundreds of pupils who now receive 100 per cent total fee remission, and one in three in Scotland receive some kind of assistance. The issue for schools, and for OSCR [the regulator], is to ensure that the availability of fee assistance is as widely known as possible, so that those in most need can access it if they wish."},{"url":null,"title":"Watchdog receives complaint about conduct of would-be Labour candidate Asim Khan","story":"              An aspiring Labour candidate who was described as \u0026ldquountruthful and \u0026ldquoevasive by a judge in a sexual harassment case is the subject of a complaint to a legal watchdog.  An individual has contacted the Scottish Legal Complaints Commission (SLCC) about the conduct of Asim Khan, pictured, in relation to an employment tribunal and a charity he chaired.  Khan said he is \"not aware\" of this complaint: \"Sadly this shows that some will plunge to any depth to maliciously smear me in order to manipulate the Glasgow South West (GSW) selection process.\"  The contest to become Labour Westminster candidate for GSW is believed to be between left-winger Matt Kerr and Khan, who is a solicitor. However, the campaign has become bogged down over a previous controversy at Roshni, a charity which helped ethnic minority survivors of sexual abuse.  In 2016, a tribunal ruled that a former female staffer, Miss C, had been the victim of \u0026ldquoharassment, victimisation and discrimination by Roshni founder Ali Khan and another man, Shaukat Sultan.  Ali Khan and the charity were ordered to jointly pay the woman around \u0026pound75,000 in compensation, but she never received a penny.  Although the judgment focused on the perpetrators of the harassment, Asim Khan as chair of the now-defunct charity was also criticised. \u0026ldquoWe have noted there was a complete failure on behalf of the chairman of the First Respondent, Mr Asim Khan to take any steps to protect the claimant, it said. The judge also required Asim Khan to issue a letter of apology to Miss C for her treatment by the two other men, which  he did.  An expenses hearing judgment included a summary of the earlier oral findings, which contained further criticism of the would-be candidate: \u0026ldquoIn relation to Asim Khan, we found Mr Khan was evasive at the outset of cross-examination.  It added: \u0026ldquoWe found that Mr Asim Khan was untruthful, and that he did know what was going on between Mr Ali Khan and the claimant ...  In another section, the judge focused on claims Miss C\u0026rsquos stepfather had been contacted in a bid to pressurise her not to pursue the claims. \u0026ldquoWe accept Asim Khan contacted [the individual] in circumstances where he understood the claimant to be represented by a solicitor. He himself is a solicitor who appears regularly before the Employment Tribunal and he knew or ought to have known ... it was entirely inappropriate for him to act in this way.  A third party has now complained to the Commission about Khan and the parts of the judgment that describe him as \u0026ldquountruthful and \u0026ldquoevasive.  The SLCC is the first point of contact for complaints about lawyers and, for conduct matters. The body has the power to make a referral to the Law Society of Scotland.  The SLCC website says the time limit for a third-party complaint is one year after the specific act has occurred, which would appear to rule out an investigation into Khan. However, the Commission can accept a complaint outside the time limit if it considers there are exceptional reasons or circumstances, or if it is in the public interest to proceed.  The complainant said: \u0026ldquoAfter the reports in the Sunday Herald, where Mr Khan is described as evasive and untruthful by a judge, I was shocked to read that Mr Khan was considered fit for office by the Labour party."},{"url":null,"title":"Stop Scotland   s    irresponsible    tourism policy  says expert","story":"              VISITScotland should stop marketing overcrowded tourist destinations with immediate effect, including islands like Skye, and focus all its efforts on moving people towards off-the-beaten-track alternatives, it has been claimed.  The call from specialist UK travel agency Responsible Travel, comes as Scotland braces itself for another bumper year in terms of tourism. The organisation is currently producing a documentary about \"over-tourism\", which will briefly feature Skye along with Barcelona and Venice.  Overcrowding in key locations \u0026ndash including Skye, Loch Ness and Edinburgh \u0026ndash is being blamed on their starring role as film and TV locations and on Instagram feeds, leading them to be \"swamped\" with tourists looking to tick them off their bucket lists.  Last year 14.1 million tourists holidayed in Scotland, attracted by the weak pound as well as accolades by influential publications such as the Rough Guide, but found not everywhere was geared up for mass tourism. In Skye there were reports of people sleeping in their cars due to booked-out accommodation, and a severe lack of parking and toilets.  At Loch Ness parties bussed from cruise ships arriving at Invergordon packed out boat trips and a report by Edinburgh Council revealed concerns about coping with tourist bottlenecks on its traditional cobbled streets.  Visit Scotland expect another busy summer, boosted by an increase in Chinese visitors, flying direct from Beijing to Edinburgh for the first time from this month. More than a million people are also expected to disembark from an unprecedented number of cruise ships this year.  In response work is going on round the clock at many popular locations to put tourism plans in place. Skye Connect, a tourist management organisation launched six months ago, has overseen plans for car parks, toilets and traffic management systems and is working with locals on 40 projects including a Skye cycle trail to cut down traffic and campervan \"servicing units\". Businesses in Loch Ness and elsewhere are extending opening hours and using social media to warn people to book ahead and avoid peak times. Additional accommodation is under development.  Yet Responsible Travel said it was now crucial that the Scottish Government and VisitScotland took action to ensure that overcrowding did not have a negative impact on either future tourism or local communities.  Chief executive Justin Francis, said: \"Visit Scotland should cease marketing any destination that\u0026rsquos exhibiting signs of over-tourism with immediate effect.\"  He also claimed that the decision to launch a new campaign to market Edinburgh to young people last week, at a time of concerns about the pressures on the city, was highly questionable, adding: \"The concept of \u0027de-marketing\u0027, reducing tourist numbers when they get too high for a destination to manage, was first established in 1960. However, until now there has been no will from governments to act on it.\"  He said that once locations started reaching \"bucket list\" status, it was common for some to exploit its popularity. \"Cruise ships might start to dock, or new flights are added, and there might be a rapid increase in room availability as Airbnb starts to take hold,\" he added. \"This can happen very fast and takes local residents and governments by surprise.  \"Residents start to get frustrated with tourists who block roads, young people find less houses to rent or buy as [they are] taken off the market via Airbnb for tourists. Shops offering goods and services to local people start to be replaced by those offering things for tourists and waste, litter and damage to paths and trails starts to increase. In short, the area starts to cater more for tourists than local people. The community is eroded and the character of the place changes \u0026ndash which ultimately means tourists lose interest too. In the long term nobody wins.\"  However, VisitScotland insisted that tourism was still a huge success story in Scotland and said it was working hard to ensure that it encouraged tourists to look past the most obvious sites. Tourism is one of Scotland\u0027s major industries.  Chris Taylor, VisitScotland regional leadership director, said that it worked closely with local agencies such as Skye Connect \u0026ndash a new tourist management organisation launched in the last six months in response to concerns about over-crowding on the island to promote the \"hidden gems\" that were often deserted even at peak times. \"We try to make sure we are not using the most obvious images of the Fairy Pools or the Old Man of Storr and steer people to other sites,\" he said, though he admitted that \"iconic images\" still had a place in the international market.  \"We always want to see that tourism is well managed,\" he added. \"It\u0027s an issue that we are very alert to but it\u0027s important to remember it has many benefits for the community. About 20-30 years ago Skye\u0027s population was still declining. Now it\u0027s supporting a very vibrant community.\"  Alistair Danter, project manager of Skye Connect, agreed claiming that huge amounts of \"non-stop work\" had been done to address issues in the last six months and stressed its importance to the island economy. \"There isn\u0027t a family on the island whose family livelihood isn\u0027t connected to tourism in some way,\" he added. \"Our challenge is to make Skye a great place to visit and to live.\"  He encouraged tourists to pre-book accommodation and consider alternative walks and attractions, which are often populated by \"a few sheep\" rather than crowds.  Meanwhile, Edinburgh council leader Adam McVey said that it was considering steps such as tourist tax and additional pedestrian zones at peak times as part of a new strategy to address challenges. \"I\u0026rsquom proud that we welcome millions of guests each year and no-one thinking about visiting the vibrant, bustling atmosphere during August should be put off,\" he added. \"I\u0026rsquom confident our strategy will give us a model to improve access to and enjoyment of the capital during the festivals and throughout the year.\"  A spokesman for the Scottish Government said it had responded by launching a new \u0026pound6 million Rural Tourism Infrastructure Fund last autumn. He added: \"We recognise tourism is vital to Scotland\u0026rsquos rural communities and our natural landscape is a key draw for visitors from across the globe. However, this success has meant increasing stress on popular locations and attractions and as a government we are determined to help.\"  A VisitScotland spokesperson said: \"Every year, Edinburgh\u0026rsquos stunning beauty, vibrant atmosphere and fascinating heritage attracts millions of visitors from around the world. The ripple effect of the visitor economy means that these visits don\u0026rsquot just benefit tourism businesses, but the city as a whole.  \"We appreciate that ensuring the capital\u0026rsquos tourism industry remains sustainable requires a sensitive approach and we are continuing to work with partners to help grow the sector in a sustainable way. VisitScotland is committed to working closely with partners, and with the City Council, to identify appropriate infrastructure requirements and ensure Edinburgh remains a must-visit destination for future generations of holidaymakers. Efforts are being made to boost and manage capacity by looking at seasonality and extending the footprint of areas visited.\"  Box-out: How to create responsible tourism  1. Regulate numbers of cruise ships docking: an Orkney Council report recommended that restrictions to protect its fragile built and natural heritage.  2. Regulate Airbnb: Proposals to restrict short term lets in Edinburgh to just 90 days a year \u0026ndash but outwith peak times \u0026ndash don\u0027t go far enough say campaigners.  3. Build infrastructure: public and shuttle buses and more ferry links are needed, it\u0027s claimed.  4. Make advance and timed booking necessary for some attractions.  5. Push off peak seasons: promoting Scotland off-season is part of VisitScotland\u0027s strategy.  6. Provide more info on the off-the-beaten track locations...and make sure they are accessible.  7. Consider a tourist tax: Edinburgh is proposing a \u0026pound1 levy on the accommodation bills of each visitor to the city."},{"url":null,"title":"Paul Hutcheon  Nicola Sturgeon is a skilful tactician but a poor strategist","story":"              ANALYSIS  IF Nicola Sturgeon\u0026rsquos speech to the SNP conference in Aberdeen was a balancing act, she managed to walk the length of the tightrope without falling into the crowd.  Her words were nominally for party delegates, but the First Minister also had to keep the wider Yes movement happy on independence without boxing herself in on indyref 2. Her challenge was to navigate a chess board of frustration, edginess and high expectation.  Her anti-Tory rhetoric pleased the faithful. Her call for immigration to be devolved reached out to SNP-sceptic moderates. And her restated promise of a summer \u0026ldquodebate on independence was probably enough for Yes supporters.  However, Sturgeon\u0026rsquos polished speech, delivered with her usual crisp professionalism, masks deep problems for which no obvious solution presents itself.  Elements of the pro-independence coalition are growing increasingly restless over the lack of a timescale for indyref 2. The movement\u0026rsquos left wing is angry about the Growth Commission\u0026rsquos \u0026ldquoneo-liberal economic reboot. Her MSPs feel detached from her leadership. And some of her Cabinet Secretaries are believed to be far from happy.  Meanwhile, SNP MPs are said to feel like courtiers who occasionally get a glimpse into the House of Sturgeon. Other party figures believe SNP headquarters, run by the First Minister\u0026rsquos husband, Peter Murrell, exists to serve the leader. The overwhelming feeling is drift, not dynamism.  Sturgeon\u0026rsquos speech confirmed she is adept at short-term political tactics, but weaker on long-term constitutional strategy. Within hours of the Brexit vote, an energised First Minister fired the starting gun for a second independence referendum, but the move angered swing voters and cost the SNP nearly half a million votes at the general election. She has, in the words of one MSP, been \u0026ldquoparalysed by caution ever since.  Her address yesterday was solid, but the Yes movement was expecting more than an upholstered version of the current position. By urging delegates to focus on the \u0026ldquowhy of independence, rather than the \u0026ldquowhen, she dropped a big hint that indyref 2 is a distant prospect. SNP insiders believe their leader has lost her confidence.  The First Minister\u0026rsquos strategy appears to be based on waiting for Brexit to turn soft unionist Remainers into nationalists. Alex Salmond tried to mould events, but Sturgeon finds herself at the mercy of a Brexit process she is struggling to shape or influence.  Wise heads believe Sturgeon should rule out another referendum in this Holyrood term and use the next three years to sell a refreshed case for independence. If public opinion shifts, she could fight the 2021 election on a promise of another public vote.  Critics may say such a strategy is politically naive. The SNP will have been in Government for 15 years and, it is credibly argued, wear and tear may deprive the pro-independence parties of their Holyrood majority.  However, last week\u0026rsquos opinion poll, which showed the SNP on over 40 per cent of the vote, was remarkable. Sturgeon is being presented with various options on how to proceed, but patience and a cool head may be the best prescriptions."},{"url":null,"title":"Russell says no Brexit compromise with Tories over Brexit power grab","story":"              SCOTLAND\u0027S Brexit minister has insisted there will be no compromise with the UK Government in the row over devolved powers without changes being made to the \"profoundly anti-democratic\" EU Withdrawal Bill.  Mike Russell insisted that the legislation \u0026ndash which has already been rejected by Holyrood \u0026ndash \"undermines the whole of the constitutional settlement\".  Ministers in Edinburgh and London have been unable to break the deadlock between the two governments over the Bill, which many politicians insist is a \"power grab\".  Speaking at the SNP conference in Aberdeen, Russell warned: \"We\u0027re heading to a situation where no matter how Scotland votes it\u0027s the Tories who get to decide.\"  While he said the Scottish Government had attempted to find a middle ground in talks with Theresa May\u0027s administration, he told the conference all those efforts had been rebuffed. And he insisted: \"There are some things you can\u0027t compromise on and some people you can\u0027t compromise with. We can\u0027t compromise if irreversible damage is to be done to Scotland and everyone who lives here. We can\u0027t compromise if the outcome would be damage to our country and its democracy. And we can compromise with those who don\u0027t care about our future, who are only moving backwards into an imaginary past.\"  He insisted: \"The Scottish Government will continue to defend Scotland\u0027s Parliament. Not because it is the best it could be, because it is the best we presently have and it is only by having that we can make it better.\"  Last month, Holyrood voted against giving formal consent to the Withdrawal Bill \u0026ndash with Labour, Lib Dem and Green MSPs voting with the SNP on the issue. While the move will not prevent the UK Government from bringing in the legislation, it could spark a constitutional crisis if the Bill has to be imposed against the wishes of the Scottish Parliament.  Russell said since then the approach of the Tory administration had been to \"refuse to acknowledge concerns and talk to the parties at the Scottish Parliament\".  He also said he believed a Brexit deal could be won which would see the UK remain in both the single market and the customs union. He told the conference: \"We will always articulate what we believe is best for Scotland and in this case that is continuing membership of the EU \u0026ndash that is what Scotland voted for in 2016 and what I am sure it would vote for again if there were another referendum. But if we can\u0027t achieve that in the short term, then the only possible alternative, the least bad alternative, is continuing membership of the single market and the customs union. That can be campaigned for and won.\""},{"url":null,"title":"Forget the World Cup     St Cadoc s under-10s have been flying the Scottish flag in Eindhoven tournament","story":"              WHILE Scotland may not be having much luck with any national team presence at this summer\u0026rsquos World Cup, a squad of over 30 under-10s have been flying the flag this weekend after they set off to Europe to compete in a tournament in Eindhoven.  A travelling party of 78 from St Cadoc\u0026rsquos Youth Club in the south side of Glasgow, including coaches and parents, set off on Friday morning to take part in the competition, hosted by Dutch club SV Nevelo FC.

Her palms were as cool as porcelain. We were ballroom dancing and, when she lifted my hand into the air, I would sloppily pirouette. My North Korean dance partner was a portrait of composure. Sadly, she was leading around an American klutz. As we did the waltz or foxtrot or whatever \u0026ndash all I know is that she played the male lead, spinning me around like a debutante \u0026ndash I tried to make sense of it all.  When my wife, friends and I entered this state-run North Korean restaurant in Bangkok, I expected a spectacle of maximum kitsch. There are similar joints scattered around Southeast Asia and, for better or worse, I\u0026rsquove been to quite a few.  You don\u0026rsquot come to these places for the overpriced bibimbap. The waitresses are the star attraction. After dishing out sizzling beef, they don spangly gowns and twirl about the dining hall, moving in perfect concert like a school of fish.  All the while, they sing beautifully into wireless mics. You might hear the schmaltzy Titanic theme song. Or Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da by The Beatles \u0026ndash sometimes punched up with an accordion solo. Or John Denver\u0026rsquos Country Roads in soaring operatic vocals.  But in my half-dozen visits to various overseas North Korean restaurants, I\u0026rsquove never witnessed any physical contact between the waitresses and the guests. Thus my shock when one of them glided over to my chair and beckoned me to dance.  That\u0026rsquos how I ended up holding hands with a representative of the world\u0026rsquos most anti-social regime.  She was resplendent in her pink hanbok, a Korean dress that, from the waist, opens up and stretches down to the floor like a massive bell. We were grace and gracelessness intertwined. My beat-up Nikes squeaked on the tile floor. Her footsteps were silent beneath her voluminous dress, its hem caressing the ground.  Let me be perfectly clear: our impromptu coupling was about as sensual as a middle-school dance. As I spun clumsily, I heard my friends guffawing. I could also feel the eyes of their smartphone cameras upon us, collecting top-notch blackmail.  The North Koreans were recording us too, of course. The ceiling was studded with little orb-shaped cameras. There was one in each corner, scanning every vantage point, capturing every conversation and gesture. As with all North Korean restaurants, this joint was thoroughly bugged.  The dancing waitress was soon joined by three ladies with identical bangs and identical glittery heels. Behind them, a screen lit up with idyllic North Korean scenery: hulking mountain ranges and dazzling snow drifts, each image photoshopped to crisp perfection.  Vivid circles of colour flashed upon the floor. They were beamed down from a bank of rotating disco lights mounted overhead. The women yanked the other customers from their seats \u0026ndash my wife, my pals, plus the only other customers: a few beer-buzzed Chinese men.  We were arranged into a conga line, gripping one another\u0026rsquos shoulders and snaking around the dining room. The waitresses were still singing, their voices melded in flawless harmony. They beamed with rehearsed joy. Any trace of individuality was hidden behind masks of practised perfection. I glanced up at the projector screen to see a funny-looking map of Asia. It was dominated by a glowing red nation that I didn\u0026rsquot immediately recognise.  Then it hit me. The nation was Korea, a fictional version where the two halves are married as one \u0026ndash all under the reign of the Kim clan. This imaginary country was depicted at an outsized scale. In reality, the Korean peninsula is just a bit larger than Florida. On this make-believe map, it looked as big as Brazil.  Block letters began to flash underneath:  KOREA IS ONE!  KOREA IS ONE!  KOREA IS ONE!  And that was my final lucid memory of the night.  North Koreans are, in the minds of Westerners, among the most exoticised people on earth. For many, encountering one of them is a truly novel experience. The regime in Pyongyang understands quite well that rarity breeds value. Its officials know that curious foreigners will pay for proximity to the citizens they\u0026rsquove so thoroughly isolated. So they find nations willing to host restaurants where tourists can indulge in a rare thrill: nights out with a cheery troupe of North Koreans.  There are more than 100 of these eateries scattered around Asia. Most are in China. But the second-biggest market is Southeast Asia, a tourism magnet attracting 100 million annual visitors from around the world. There are now Pyongyang-run eateries across Cambodia, Vietnam, Myanmar, Indonesia, Laos and Thailand.  The female servers at these restaurants aren\u0026rsquot just any North Koreans, mind you. They\u0026rsquore exported from the regime\u0026rsquos artist class \u0026ndash an elite clique of singers, instrumentalists and dancers. They\u0026rsquove been diverted from their official role \u0026ndash musically venerating the Kim regime \u0026ndash into tourist traps overseas. As Professor Sung-Yoon Lee of Boston\u0026rsquos Tufts University, a top expert on North Korea, told me: \"They could be very competitive students at any leading conservatory in New York. They\u0026rsquore very talented, very pretty,\" Lee said. \"But they aren\u0026rsquot only selected based on looks. The regime also looks at the allegiance of their families. They must go through an intense selection process.\"  In other words, the woman who slow dances with a gangly foreigner in Hanoi or Bangkok may be the daughter of a North Korean colonel. Her high-class lineage, however, does not guarantee a life of ease. These women operate under conditions that, if replicated in London or Los Angeles, might land their employers in prison. The singing waitresses don\u0026rsquot report to work. They live at work. They all bunk together in dorms, located above the dining hall or in rented buildings nearby.  Though posted near some of the world\u0026rsquos top tourist sites \u0026ndash Bangkok\u0026rsquos temples or the ruins of Angkor Wat \u0026ndash they are forbidden from leaving their restaurant\u0026rsquos immediate vicinity without close supervision. The women are constantly surveilled, both through recording devices installed around the property and by their own colleagues.  \"What\u0026rsquos interesting,\" Lee says, \"is that restaurants are an entrepreneurial enterprise. So you may ask, \u0027How is that allowed by an authoritarian regime that bans free enterprise back home?\u0027 It\u0026rsquos because this regime desperately needs foreign cash. They\u0026rsquoll do anything to acquire it.\"  North Korea\u0026rsquos government, Lee says, \"operates like a giant criminal syndicate\". Its ruling party officials may proclaim themselves s of a sacred Marxist revolution, one that will eventually liberate all Koreans from \"capitalist hell\". But they actually function more like a transnational mafia \u0026ndash one that now happens to own a hydrogen bomb.  At North Korea\u0026rsquos outset, its founding father Kim Il-sung envisioned a utopia so thoroughly socialist that its citizens would seldom touch cash. It hasn\u0026rsquot worked out that way. Today, the government is starving for foreign money. Its own currency, decorated with atomic symbols and stoic peasants, is an over-manipulated and semi-worthless mess.  This sad situation is owed in large part to the Kim clan\u0026rsquos pursuit of humankind\u0026rsquos most powerful creation: nuclear weapons. To punish the regime, the United Nations imposes sanctions that restrict North Korea from accessing the global financial system. So the regime feels justified in seeking cash in the underworld.  North Korea has deployed an army of roughly 100,000 workers around the world, mostly to Russia and China but also across Asia and the Middle East. These workers are used as cheap labour to build skyscrapers, stitch clothes and, yes, sing in kitschy lounges.  But whether its workers are sawing logs in Siberia or crooning in Bangkok, the regime absorbs their weekly pay, often taking a 50 to 75 per cent cut. So says Andrei Lankov, a Russian scholar studying North Korea\u0026rsquos economy.  The South Korean government likes to portray the singing waitresses as shadow fundraisers for Pyongyang\u0026rsquos nuclear weapons program. But Lankov believes it\u0026rsquos more complicated than that. The cash that guest workers raise, he said, will go to everything from \u0026ldquoChanel bags for mistresses of top leaders to \u0026ldquoantibiotics for sick children to \u0026ldquospare parts for trans-continental missiles capable of hitting New York\".  The workers themselves are held blameless for their government\u0026rsquos wrongdoing. And rightly so. Because they have so little autonomy \u0026ndash they can\u0026rsquot quit or even complain \u0026ndash Human Rights Watch refers to the waitresses are trafficking victims. Like all foreign-deployed North Koreans, they\u0026rsquore believed to toil under conditions the UN describes as \"forced labour\" or \"slave like\".  But I\u0026rsquove often wondered: is that how these women see themselves?  Active-duty waitresses from North Korea don\u0026rsquot talk to American journalists. I know this because, against my better judgment, I approached the manager of yet another Pyongyang-run eatery in Bangkok and asked to interview his staff. He told me that the US media are filled with \u0026ldquoliars that \u0026ldquojust make up stuff and put it on CNN\".  So I set out to find someone with the freedom to talk \u0026ndash a woman raised in the same arts-and-propaganda regime that produces the singing waitresses. Her name is Han Seo-hee, now 35, a former North Korean singer extraordinaire. I met her in Seoul.  Before Han defied her government by fleeing to South Korea in 2006, she had risen to the top echelons of the Pyongyang performance circuit. She\u0026rsquos even played the oungum (a lute-like instrument) in a recital for Kim Jong-il.  At the age of eight \u0026ndash as a little girl in the mountainous town of Musan, North Korea \u0026ndash Han was pulled from her classroom by a regime-appointed talent scout. She was asked to sing a few bars. It was quickly decided: unlike her peers, Han would not spend her afternoons yanking up radishes on a collective farm. She would instead devote her adolescence to glorifying the fatherland through song.  \"It was a high honor,\" Han said. \"My mother was thrilled that her daughter would become an artist.\"  Each day, after school ended at 2pm, Han reported to a four-story cement rehearsal hall. There were classrooms devoted to honing different skills: dancing, choral singing or playing instruments. The children often trained hours past sunset.  Their goal was flawless synchronicity. North Korea\u0026rsquos artistic style is steeped in socialist idealism. Their many voices had to resound as a single, unwavering one. There is no room for flashy soloists, no place for prima donnas. \"In America or South Korea, girls have attitude,\" Han said. \"In North Korea, forget it. You\u0026rsquore not there to be creative or steal the spotlight.\"  The young performers noticed that they all looked alike: slender, milk-skinned, eyes like fawns. \"You need big eyes, a fair complexion and a round face,\" Han said. \"Appearance is as important as musical aptitude.\"  This is the genetic material required of all North Korean female performers. Those who fully exploit their gifts will rise in the ranks, Han says, and enjoy pleasures unknown to peasants.  Top-notch singers are often rewarded with residence in the capital, Pyongyang, where they enjoy a rare luxury: a steady supply of hot water and electricity. They get to adorn themselves in silky gowns and perfume. In their weekly rations, they may receive tropical fruit instead of cabbage \u0026ndash a food perk beyond any rice farmer\u0026rsquos dreams.  Singers can secure their status by joining performance teams attached to various bureaus. These organs of state are run by generals who, like members of a royal court, enjoy surrounding themselves with artisans. Han was recruited to sing and play the lute for the Ministry of People\u0026rsquos Security, which runs a network of gulags. (Imagine if the Stasi had its own orchestra.)  \"By North Korean standards, we always ate well,\" Han said. \"Other artists wanted to join my special orchestra just for the food.\"  \"So what did you eat?\" I ask.  \"Bananas!\"  \"Bananas?\"  \"Oh, yes,\" she said. \"My cousins were so jealous.\"  This is the world from which North Korea\u0026rsquos singing waitresses are plucked and sent abroad, Han told me. The restaurant circuit is actually \"a good way to make use of our not-so-talented people\". The regime, Han said, keeps its most talented singers at home. \"So it\u0026rsquos good for girls who were selected as children but don\u0026rsquot grow tall enough.\"  Moreover, the pittance they receive from working overseas \u0026ndash perhaps $2,000 a year \u0026ndash is considered a small fortune in North Korea, where the nation\u0026rsquos $28 billion economy is roughly on par with that of Edinburgh. A typical North Korean might make as little as $500 per year.  Han was never tapped to sing abroad. (\"I was too talented,\" she said.) But she did train alongside women who were sent overseas. She told me they usually jumped at the opportunity to make money for their families.  This pulled my thoughts back to that dancer in Bangkok \u0026ndash the woman with whom I conga\u0026rsquod and pirouetted \u0026ndash and her fellow socialist showgirls, each wearing a smile they\u0026rsquod rehearsed since childhood.  I\u0026rsquod come to Han seeking insight into their inner lives. Do they feel honoured to carry out their sworn duty: generating funds to fortify their nation against a foreign menace? Or are these women like captive songbirds \u0026ndash with masters charging admission to their cages?  Had I indulged in some glammed-up slave trade? I put this word to Han \u0026ndash \"slaves\" \u0026ndash and she rolled her eyes.  They\u0026rsquore not slaves, she said. They\u0026rsquore banana eaters.  \"So,\" I asked, \"you don\u0026rsquot think the waitresses I\u0026rsquove met are unhappy?\"  \"Hardly,\" Han said. \"They are the envy of their friends and the pride of their families.\"  Han seemed sincere. But in the coming days, I would learn that conditions in these restaurants were perhaps murkier than she knew. My continued pursuit of these questions would lead me to a strange plot entangling a dozen North Korean waitresses, a kidnapping plot and a clique of South Korean spies.

You know, Alex Salmond, the former leader of the SNP, who led the 2014 referendum campaign. Perhaps he\u0026rsquos been spirited away under a witness protection programme and given a new name. At any rate, his public profile since the publication of the SNP\u0026rsquos new Growth Commission report has been next to non-existent. This may not be unconnected with the fact that the Growth Commission report is being seen by many as a repudiation of the 2013 Independence White Paper, which was his bible.  But he might have cause to be just a little put out, because that optimistic independence prospectus was remarkably successful. Not only was the 2014 referendum result closer than anyone expected, the White Paper arguably formed the basis for the recent remarkable change in Scottish voter opinion on the economic case for independence. The number who believe the Scottish economy would improve after leaving the UK has risen from 26 per cent to 41 per cent since 2014, according to the British Social Attitudes survey. And this has nothing to do with the Growth Commission effect, since the research was conducted before Andrew Wilson\u0026rsquos report was published.  So something has been going right. Nicola Sturgeon had every reason to indulge in a bit of good old self-congratulation in her speech to conference, since the SNP\u0026rsquos popularity in Westminster and Holyrood is looking remarkably healthy, one year after the aborted independence referendum. Fourteen points ahead after 10 years in office is a remarkable achievement, almost unprecedented in British electoral history. And Labour being down five points in the latest YouGov poll on Westminster voting intentions is particularly gratifying for the SNP.  If true, it would kill the Corbyn surge stone dead as Scottish Labour would be again reduced to one solitary MP. That\u0026rsquos if there were to be an election tomorrow \u0026ndash which there very well might be if Theresa May\u0026rsquos government continues to collapse in Brexit disarray.  It\u0026rsquos perhaps not surprising in this context that there wasn\u0026rsquot much discussion of the Growth Commission on the floor of the SNP conference. Those who have been discussing it, outside the SNP, believe it has, by coming clean on deficit reduction, made Salmond look as if he was chasing unicorns in 2014.  Mind you, just imagine, in those TV debates with Better Together\u0026rsquos Alistair Darling, if Salmond had announced \u0026ldquorobust spending constraints would be applied on the morn of independence, followed by 25 years of sweat and tears until Scotland caught up with the Netherlands. He would have been torn apart. Or rather, Darling would have agreed with him \u0026ndash which is worse.  Salmond would at least have had a Plan B \u0026ndash sterlingisation \u0026ndash but Darling would have seen that as an admission that a Scottish pound would have to depend on the Bank of England setting interest rates for the foreseeable future without there being any scope for devaluation.  Alex Salmond is a brilliant politician, and salesman, but even the past master of chutzpah would have had difficulty selling that.  One of his most awkward foes in 2014 was the Institute for Fiscal Studies, which delivered a series of reports arguing that an independent Scotland, even with oil, would be in spending difficulties. The IFS will be delivering its considered report on the Growth Commission this week, and the good news for Andrew Wilson is that it\u0026rsquoll be endorsing it wholeheartedly. It thinks that Wilson\u0026rsquos plan is the only reasonable way to address the independence spending deficit in GERS.  However, it will also point out that this will still lead to big cuts in spending, even if the promised 0.5 per cent annual increase in overall spending is delivered. This is because overall spending including things like benefits and pensions, not just departmental spending, is going up a lot faster than that.  But perhaps the numbers are less important than we give them credit for. Scottish voters heard all this from Project Fear in 2014 and many discounted it. They may be inclined to look past the deficit numbers, fiscal projections and problems of transition, and see only the bright prospect of self-government. It may also be that Scots are prepared to put up with just a little hardship in order to gain the greater goal. They might even feel better disposed to a prospectus that admits that the risk is on the downside. That is certainly Wilson\u0026rsquos view.  However, while the voters may glaze over the numbers, his many critics in the independence movement are unlikely to go quietly. The Growth Commission report has divided the broad coalition that fought the 2014 referendum campaign and that has created, really for the first time, a serious and very vocal internal opposition, in the form of left-wing Yessers like Robin McAlpine of The Common Weal, who compares the report to \u0026ldquowalking off a cliff.  One of the leaders of the Radical Independence Campaign, Jonathon Shafi, joined forces last week with arch-unionist blogger Kevin Hague to demand a response from Wilson to the charge that the Growth Commission replicates the deficit reduction programme implemented by the UK Tory Chancellor, George Osborne, in 2010. They didn\u0026rsquot get one.  Instead, Wilson tweeted that he wasn\u0026rsquot interested in engaging with the \u0026ldquowall of criticism from the entrenched and partisan and said he would engage with them \u0026ldquowhen an alternative prospectus is set out. This seems improbable, which presumably means that the SNP isn\u0026rsquot going to discuss the document very much at all. This may be a good thing. Tensions had been building in the wider nationalist movement before the Growth Commission, but it seems to have marked something of a turning point.  Some prominent names from the indyref class of 2014 are so disillusioned that they are privately talking about giving up on politics, at least for the next few years. But they may find, when they return to the independence movement, that there isn\u0026rsquot a place for them any more. The political impact of the report has been to marginalise the left, and make it the target of open hostility from mainstream nationalists. Nicola Sturgeon is dropping heavy hints that the next independence campaign should be a wholly owned property of the Scottish National Party.  It is the First Minister alone who will lead the next referendum campaign, whenever that is. The recent mass street demonstrations, coupled with the very positive polling figures, puts even greater pressure on Sturgeon to fire the independence gun sooner rather than later.  She may have to overcome her innate caution. Support for independence on some reading of the polls, is actually up on 2014 \u0026ndash though still not over the 50 per cent barrier. This is pretty remarkable since independence has been off the political agenda for 12 months. The #ScotlandCan contingent say that if she waits until the polls show 55 per cent plus, she may wait forever.  The First Minister has a mandate \u0026ndash what she calls a \u0026ldquotriple lock \u0026ndash on a repeat referendum, won by a vote in the Scottish Parliament last year. But even on the very favourable voting figures, the SNP is unlikely to have a majority for independence after the 2021 Holyrood elections. The Mandate Tendency say it\u0026rsquos now or never. So, Nicola, do you feel lucky? Or perhaps the question should be: what would Alex do?  var panels = panels || []    var panel = {    name : \u0027ballot\u0027,    target: \u0027ballot_115189120018685\u0027,    params: {ballot_id: \u002718685\u0027, template: \u0027responsive\u0027, callbak: function() {ballotVote.init()}}}panels.push(panel)"},{"url":null,"title":"Feminist political party targets Mark McDonald s seat","story":"              THE Women\u0027s Equality Party (WEP) will seek to put up a candidate against disgraced politician Mark McDonald MSP if he stands in the next Scottish elections in 2021.  McDonald stepped down as Childcare Minister following claims of sexual harassment but returned to the Scottish Parliament as an MSP earlier this year despite an inquiry uncovering his \"deliberate\" pattern of \u0026ldquoinappropriate and \u0026ldquopersistent behaviour towards two women.  Party leader Sophie Walker yesterday told members at the UK feminist party\u0027s first Scottish conference since it was launched in 2015, that despite the prominence of female politicians including First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and Scottish Conservatives leader Ruth Davidson, his refusal to step down from Parliament was proof that that the institution was \"still patriarchal\".  Walker, who last year stood in Shipley against Conservative MP Philip Davies to protest against his views on domestic violence policy, said the party would now turn its attention to McDonald\u0027s Aberdeen Donside constituency if he decided to stand in the future.  She told the Sunday Herald that as a small party it aimed to act tactically to split the vote in order to highlight the need for all parties to take gender equality seriously.  \"The pace of change has been glacial so we work strategically to make the most impact,\" she added. \"As McDonald has insisted on sitting tight despite his behaviour, that is a seat that we will be asking our members to consider. Sexual harassment is not about sex, it\u0027s about power and we can end sexual harassment by understanding that it is a cause and consequence of inequality.\"  Other issues discussed at the conference include calls for the Scottish Government to introduce the so-called Nordic model, which criminalises those who purchase sex. Supporters claim it drives down demand and protects women from abuse and trafficking. However, opponents including Amnesty International, favour complete decriminalisation of sex work.  The party will also push for legislation to allow 50/50 quotas in the Scottish Parliament. Kirstein Rummery, Scottish policy spokesperson, added: \"There is often opposition to the idea of quotas because it is felt that positions should be given on merit. But merit as we currently see it is often shorthand for privilege.  \"At the moment we have two thirds men and the system favours the incumbent. Without quotas it will take take 50 years to reach parity.\"  Mark McDonald declined to comment."},{"url":null,"title":"David Pratt  US and North Korea talks - Deal or no deal ","story":"              By any reckoning the meeting itself is a remarkable achievement. Two leaders, whose war of words only last year had the world on edge over the possibility of an all out military confrontation, will now instead sit down for talks on peace and disarmament.  For Donald Trump it\u0026rsquos the chance to make history as the first sitting US President to meet directly with a North Korean leader.  For Kim Jong Un it will be the opportunity to achieve what his father and grandfather never could, a meeting with a US President that will both consolidate his legacy and possibly change the economic course of his country.  So far so good, but beyond this historic significance there remains as many questions as there does answers as to just where the Trump-Kim summit will lead.  Any clues as to which direction the talks are likely to take will come long after 9am local time on Tuesday.  It\u0026rsquos then that the negotiating begins in earnest when Trump will sit down with North Korea\u0026rsquos reclusive young leader at the Capella Hotel on what has been described as Singapore\u0026rsquos \u0026ldquoconveniently isolated Sentosa Island.  Speaking to the AmericanPublic Broadcasting Service (PBS) last week,Professor Sung-Yoon Lee a specialist on North Korea at Tufts University in the US said the site \u0026ldquoaffords added security and, from the Singaporeans, US and North Korean government perspective, has the added benefit of better muzzling protesters and human rights activists.  Now a luxury resort whose name translates as Peace and Tranquillity, Sentosa once housed a prisoner of war camp run by wartime Japanese forces and was called \u0026ldquoRear Death Island. Yet despite such an ominous portent for a historic summit aimed at arms reduction, their remains real hopes that something positive will come from the talks.  In a nutshell what lies on the table is a possible deal in which Trump hopes to persuade Kim to give up his nuclear weapons programme in exchange for the lifting of US economic sanctions.  According to Scott A Snyder director of the programme on US-Korea policy at the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), the opening positions of both the US and North Korea are \u0026ldquolong-standing, well-known, and seemingly non-convergent.  \u0026ldquoThe US must hold to its demand for comprehensive denuclearisation of North Korea to uphold the validity of the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty (NPT), says Snyder.  \u0026ldquoThe US must also deny North Korea the ability to use the nuclear threat to intimidate South Korean and Japanese allies, and eliminate risks of nuclear proliferation to other bad actors, outlined Snyder in a recent blog for the US based think-tank CFR.  From North Korea\u0026rsquos perspective says Snyder, it meanwhile has long sought to establish a deterrent against more powerful adversaries to guarantee the survival of Kim\u0026rsquos regime in Pyongyang and to improve its strategic position and standing as a normal and \u0026ldquoresponsible nuclear state.  While on the face of it these respective positions might seem pretty irreconcilable, what is clear is that both leaders have invested their reputations in the negotiations so the stakes could not be higher.  For his part Kim has effectively used his country\u0026rsquosown unprecedented nuclear capability to ensure that missiles and nuclear weapons are forefront in the minds of the US and international community. For precisely this reason say some observers it\u0026rsquos doubtful that there will be much in the way of talk about human rights in the negotiating sessions between the two men.  In reaching the point where he is now Kim has made every effort also to shift global perception of him from isolated authoritarian ruler to international statesman.  The fact too that he has had an unconventional US president to deal with has arguably only helped Kim\u0026rsquos attempts at rehabilitating his image and that of North Korea. Trump too of course has benefited politically from this process. Recent polls show that many Americans approve of his handling of North Korea.  That said there are also many sceptics and detractors too within the US corridors of power. On Friday the Washington Post highlighted how US allies and many Republicans are raising concerns that Trump may impulsively give in on issues they say should be deal-breakers for the US.  There are concerns the newspaper says, over ambiguity about exactly what \u0026ldquodenuclearisation must look like. This has left many US officials uneasy, while others fear Trump may yield on a longtime North Korean wish that the US withdraws some or all of its military presence on the Korean Peninsula.  Many, in particular national security hawks, remain convinced that Trump has misread Kim\u0026rsquos willingness to denuclearise.  \u0026ldquoMy suspicion remains that he is going to try to get as much sanctions relief as possible without having to give up his weapons, Marco Rubio, Republican Senator for Florida was quoted by the Washington Post as saying, echoing the views of others.  Rubio, who applauded Trump\u0026rsquos now-reversed decision to cancel the summit, said at the time that it was apparent that Kim\u0026rsquos goal \u0026ldquowas either to gain sanctions relief in exchange for nothing or to collapse international sanctions by making the US appear to be the unreasonable party.  Rubio is far from alone in his scepticism over the summit. There are others too within  US administration ranks who have shown no real appetite for the on-again, off-again, on-again diplomatic meeting between the two leaders.  Some US officials have even raised concerns as to the actual value and morality of sitting down with such an avowed enemy as North Korea. The United States and North Korea are technically still at war they are quick to remind those who disagree with them.  None of this of course appears to matter to Trump. On Thursday he continued to antagonise other leaders at the G7 summit in Quebec with his decision to impose tariffs on steel and aluminium imports, and making a surprise call for Russia to be readmitted to the group of top industrialised nations after its expulsion for annexing Crimea.  All this before he left for Singapore predicting \u0026ldquogreat success at the summit with Kim and saying it was possible he could sign an agreement with him to formally end the Korean War.  But the carping of the sceptics in the US will no doubt niggle in the back of Trump\u0026rsquos mind as he sits down with Kim. Some it might be argued have only made the US leader\u0026rsquos negotiating position all the more difficult and vulnerable by stoking up long held suspicions over US motives and intent.  Nothing more starkly illustrated this recently than US National Security Adviser John Bolton\u0026rsquos suggestion that the model for North Korea\u0026rsquos denuclearisation should be what happened in Libya in 2003.  In using such a historical parallel Bolton\u0026rsquos suggestion was tantamount to demanding that North Korea\u0026rsquos weapons be crated up and sent directly to America.  Unsurprisingly Bolton\u0026rsquos remarks did not go down well in Pyongyang for whom the Libya model still resonates in the North Korean political mind-set.  North Korea well recalls how in 2003, Libya agreed to give up its nuclear, chemical, biological and missile programmes to restore its standing in the international community and get sanctions relief. Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi was later driven out of power and killed in 2011 during the Arab Spring revolution, a fate not lost on the North Koreans.  Writing in the US magazine Foreign Policy recently Doug Bandow a Senior Fellow at the Cato Institute think-tank summed up US political thinking all those years back.  \u0026ldquoUS President George W. Bush announced in 2003 that Libya\u0026rsquos \u0026ldquogood faith will be returned. For eight years, the United States and Europe showered him - Colonel Gaddafi -with flowers and whispered sweet nothings in his ear.  It\u0026rsquos a measure of how touchy Pyongyang is about the Libya parallel that mention of it first by Bolton and again by Vice President Mike Pence nearly derailed Trump\u0026rsquos historic meeting with Kim some weeks back  Nevertheless Bolton like other uber-hawks in the administration continues to see the summit not as a step towards peace but as a prelude to, possibly even a pretext for, war. Writing recently on the CNN website Dr Ira Helfand co-president of the International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War (IPPNW) highlighted the potentially incendiary role Bolton has had in the run up to the summit.  \u0026lsquoJohn Bolton has grudgingly welcomed the summit because it will \u0026ldquoforeshorten the amount of time that we\u0026rsquore going to waste in negotiations that will never produce the result we want, he quoted the US National Security Adviser as saying.  Bolton too in an interview as early as last autumn argued that \u0026ldquomore diplomacy with North Korea, more sanctions ... is just giving North Korea more time to increase its nuclear arsenal.  None of this will be helpful to Trump at Sentosa on Tuesday even before the great \u0026lsquodealmaker\u0026rsquo has to contend with the North Korean\u0026rsquos own negotiating style.  TIME\u0026rsquo magazine\u0026rsquos Beijing correspondent Charlie Campbell, who knows the region and its tensions well says that dealing with North Koreans is always fraught, as they are also \u0026ldquopunctilious about protocol.  He says that the main problem with the summit will be to lay down the law or making any unbending demands at the outset. \u0026ldquoIf its just a meet and greet, it should go fine, Campbell wryly observed recently.  For many observers though the prospect of any major breakthrough strikes them as unfathomable.  Kim they point out remains an absolute dictator who not only presides over forced-labour camps but constantly and clinically eliminates any perceived political opponents and only last month was threatening the US with a possible nuclear \u0026ldquoshowdown.  But challenging as getting something out of the talks might be it remains a far better course down which to go than another escalation of hostilities. It remains a sobering thought as to what would happen if the US were to abandon diplomacy and sanctions and instead pursue a military option.  While the specific war plans of North Korea and the US are not, of course, publicly available, everything that is known suggests that any military conflict would be a disaster on a giant scale.  Some 25 million people live in the metropolitan area of the South Korean capital Seoul, within range of the massive North Korean artillery batteries just north of the border. Casualties in the first days of a conventional artillery attack on Seoul could exceed 100,000, according to some estimates.  A US nuclear attack on North Korea designed to \u0026ldquoguarantee the elimination of the North\u0026rsquos nuclear and missile programmes would probably involve 30 or more weapons set to explode at ground level. The resulting clouds of radioactive fallout would envelop much of North Korea and heavily populated areas of South Korea, killing more than 780,000 people and injuring a million more, according to scientific analysis quoted recently by CNN from the research university Stevens Institute of Technology in the US.  Give such a stark alternative to peaceful negotiations what then can we expect from the Trump-Kim summit? Most observers admit it remains near impossible to predict but according to Jenny Town research analyst at the Stimson Centre and managing editor of the much cited 38 North website, we can perhaps expect to see at least some clarification of what the negotiated end goal is and sense of time frame for trying to achieve it.  In addition says Town the two leaders likely will establish some of the essential matters that they want to address under an agreement and a commitment to the negotiating process.  \u0026ldquoI wouldn\u0026rsquot be surprised either if they come away with a big gesture of sorts to kick-start the process, she told American Public Broadcasting Service last week.  Most likely, this is just the beginning of a long process that will require persistence and patience if it is to succeed. Tuesday will mark a historic day in the history of US-North Korean relations. These are very early days but at least it\u0026rsquos a start and a far cry from that war of words only last year."},{"url":null,"title":"The 101 win a spot at Belladrum Festival after public vote","story":"              RISING Aberdeen-based band The 101 are the lucky winners of a Belladrum Festival competition, in association with the Sunday Herald, earning the six-piece indie pop-funk band a place on the festival bill.  The 101 were in competition with three other up and coming hopefuls for the chance to perform as part of the Belladrum Tartan Heart Music and Arts Festival. An online poll began last month on the heraldscotland website and allowed members of the public the chance to vote for their favourite band or solo singer, of which The 101 ultimately won. Festival sponsor BBC Alba will broadcast the band\u0027s set.  \u0026ldquoBBC ALBA will be back at Belladrum this year, broadcasting live on Thursday August 2, Friday August 3 and Saturday August 4 with a mix of stage sets and acoustic performances. The 101 has been invited to perform an exclusive acoustic set for broadcast on BBC Alba, the channel said.  Although they are still a relatively young band, having only been formed in 2017, The 101 have already begun to make a name for themselves, both locally and nationally. Consisting of band members Dexter Fawcett (lead vocals and synth), Ross Buchan (lead guitar), Cameron Stephen (drums and vocals), Andrew Joseph (electric guitar), Matthew Read (guitar and vocals) and Nick Cameron (upright bass and bass guitar), The 101 specialises in classic 1980s funk, incorporating it into their own take on anthemic Indie pop music. This is a unique style that has already brought the band to the attention of major studios and publications, like BBC Scotland, STV, NME and Clash Magazine, as well as editorial backing from Spotify. This has seen the band awarded accolades that include the Pride of Aberdeen\u0026rsquos The Ones to Watch 2017 award, and being featured on Amazing Radio\u0026rsquos Starlets to Watch in 2018.  Now, the band find themselves in the spotlight once again, as their recent competition win provides a significant opportunity to climb further up the music industry ladder. Having already played to sold out crowds on their Scottish tour, notably at Aberdeen\u0026rsquos local The Lemon Tree live music venue, as well as sharing the stage with other notable bands like Fickle Friends, Vistas, Pride, and The Little Kicks, The 101 are no strangers to the Scottish live scene. Their new placing on the bill for Belladrum means they will be playing alongside other major musical talents, such as Paloma Faith, Primal Scream, Amy MacDonald, The Charlatans, Professor Green and Roseanne Cash.  The Belladrum Tartan House Festival has run annually since its inception in 2004. It has continued to rapidly grow in popularity since then, having sold out in advance every year since 2008. Hosting a venue of up to 18,500 people over the course of two and a half days, it has become one of Scotland\u0026rsquos largest cultural events, known in particular for its family friendly atmosphere and diverse musical scope.  Belladrum veterans include The Proclaimers, Tom Jones, Ed Sheeren, Madness, The Wombats, and even Two Door Cinema Club, one of The 101\u0026rsquos key influences, among many others. Offering numerous stages for its various live performers, as well as several alternatives including children\u0026rsquos play areas, arts and crafts workshops, and music and dance classes, the festival has become a place for bands to expand their audiences, and for said audiences to discover new talents.  The festival will be held at the Belladrum Estate near Inverness between Thursday August 2 and Saturday August 4, where The 101 will join the vast line up of musical talents on display."},{"url":null,"title":"Fracking is damned by international tribunal","story":"              THE fracking industry has been condemned by an international tribunal for harming humanity, violating human rights and damaging nature.  The Permanent Peoples\u0026rsquo Tribunal, set up in Italy in 1979 to defend human rights, has investigated fracking and issued a preliminary statement accusing companies and governments of failing in their duties. The tribunal took key evidence from Scotland, where the Grangemouth petrochemical giant, Ineos, has taken the Scottish Government to court over its \u0026ldquoeffective ban on fracking. A verdict is awaited.  A panel of 10 judges from eight countries held online hearings on fracking over five days last month. They concluded that the rights of people and nature were \u0026ldquosubjugated to the financial interests of states and corporations as part of a \u0026ldquosystemic crime architecture.  The judges described the evidence they heard as consistent, and based on hundreds of independent reports. \u0026ldquoThe industry has failed to fulfil its legal and moral obligations, they said.  \u0026ldquoThe processes of fracking contribute substantially to anthropogenic harm, including climate change and global warming, and involve massive violations of a range of substantive and procedural human rights and the rights of nature.  The judges also criticised governments across the world for failing to regulate the industry and protect communities and nature. \u0026ldquoThey have failed to act promptly and effectively to the dangers of climate change that fracking represents, they said. The tribunal, which is based in Rome, seeks to uphold the Universal Declaration of Peoples\u0026rsquo Rights agreed in Algiers in 1976. Its main aim is \u0026ldquoto contribute to the struggle of peoples for their self-determination and the prevention, assessment, judgment and reparation of their fundamental rights.  One of the lawyers who gave evidence was Moray-based Lisa Mead, who is director of the Earth Law Alliance, an environmental group. \u0026ldquoWe gathered and submitted a mass of evidence showing the negative impacts on nature and on human health, she said. \u0026ldquoFracking and other forms of unconventional oil and gas extraction are highly dangerous and damaging activities. Humans and nature are suffering severely negative consequences as a result, particularly in the USA, Canada and Australia.  Mead made submissions on climate pollution, toxic waste water and risks to the natural environment. She accused the fracking industry of making money at the expense of people\u0026rsquos health and \u0026ldquorisking our future on this planet.  She praised the Scottish Government for extending its moratorium on fracking, and described its approach as \u0026ldquoan exemplar for other countries. \u0026ldquoI just wish that the UK government had the sense to follow the same line, she added. Two experts from the University of Stirling also gave evidence to the tribunal. \u0026ldquoThe arguments of the UK industry about the alleged safety of fracking do not stand up to scrutiny, said professor Andrew Watterson, head of the university\u0026rsquos occupational and environmental health research group. \u0026ldquoThe tribunal assessment demolishes the assertion, never based in fact, that there was some sort of scientific and research consensus supporting the fracking industry claims that it would not damage either our climate or public health. He added: \u0026ldquoThe tribunal decision at this stage vindicates the wise actions of the Scottish Government in their careful deliberations about fracking and their decision not to support fracking in favour of protecting public health.  Will Dinan, an academic at Stirling University and director of the monitoring group, Spinwatch, accused the industry of a \u0026ldquomoral and legal failure. The Scottish Government was likely \u0026ldquolargely excused from criticism, he said.  Andy Gheorghiu, policy adviser with the campaign group Food \u0026amp Water Europe, called on Scottish ministers to reject fracking licences under newly devolved powers. He said: \u0026ldquoA court of international importance has confirmed that the Scottish Government was on the absolutely right path to introduce an indefinite moratorium on fracking and defy the bully tactics of Ineos.  Ineos is demanding multi-million pound compensation from taxpayers for the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos decision not to allow fracking. Lawyers for the government argued in court that a ban had not yet been technically imposed. The Scottish Government stressed that its \u0026ldquopreferred position was not to support the development of unconventional oil and gas. \u0026ldquoThis position is subject to a strategic environmental assessment, said a government spokesperson. \u0026ldquoIt would be inappropriate to comment further during the judicial review process.  UK Onshore Oil and Gas (UKOOG), which represents fracking companies, highlighted an 2014 report by a Scottish Government panel of experts. It concluded that Scotland\u0026rsquos regulatory system was \u0026ldquosufficiently robust to manage fracking, according to UKOOG\u0026rsquos chief executive, Ken Cronin.  \u0026ldquoWe would suggest that is a better guide to environmental safety, he said. \u0026ldquoBeing able to heat your home, cook your food and use a whole range of manufactured goods produced by oil and gas are human rights too.  Ineos did not respond to requests to comment."},{"url":null,"title":"Crackdown on misuse of laser  devices means tougher penalties","story":"              Owners of laser devices face tougher penalties for misusing what they \u0026ldquomistakenly believed to be a toy, pilots have warned.  From July 10, anyone caught targeting aircraft, road vehicles or boats with a laser beam faces up to five years in prison, an unlimited fine, or both.  The Laser Misuse (Vehicles) Act will also make it an offence to point a laser at air traffic controllers.  It is hoped prosecutions will become easier and quicker by removing the need for police officers to establish proof of intention to cause a safety hazard.  The legislation makes it a punishable offence if the act of shining a laser beam is done deliberately or without reasonable precautions to avoid doing so.  Former RAF and British Airways pilot Steve Landells, who is a flight safety specialist at pilots\u0026rsquo union Balpa, said: \u0026ldquoLaser users need to get to grips with this law change or they could soon find themselves facing time in jail. Lasers are not toys.  \u0026ldquoIf you have one and don\u0026rsquot have a legitimate reason for owning it, or if you have bought one for your kids, we suggest you take the batteries out and throw it away.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos not worth you, or someone close to you, getting a criminal record for the sake of what is mistakenly believed to be a toy.  Laser misuse has become a growing concern, particularly near airports where they can dazzle and distract pilots and air traffic controllers.  UK airports reported 989 laser incidents to the Civil Aviation Authority last year.  Heathrow was the worst affected with 107 incidents, followed by Gatwick (70), Manchester (63) and Birmingham (59).  In a statement released when the new laws received Royal Assent last month, Aviation Minister Baroness Sugg said: \u0026ldquoWe are taking action to provide greater protection against irresponsible laser use.  \u0026ldquoLasers can have very serious, potentially fatal consequences and offenders should face tough penalties for endangering the lives of others.  \u0026ldquoWe also hope that these new measures will act as a deterrent against the misuse of lasers."},{"url":null,"title":"Theresa May reveals she has never watched Love Island","story":"              Theresa May has admitted that she has never seen Love Island.

Instead, the First Minister said the coming months should be used as an \u0026ldquoopportunity to persuade No voters of the case for Scotland maximising its potential outside the UK.  She said SNP activists should not \"worry all the time about when we might vote again\", but instead engage on the substantive arguments for independence.  The blunt message risks antagonising some of her own supporters and parts of the wider Yes movement which have been agitating for a referendum.  Around 40,000 supporters marched in support of independence in Glasgow last month, and another 10,000 marched in Dumfries last week.  In the SNP deputy leadership contest, most members cast their first preference vote for a candidate who wanted a referendum by the 2021 Holyrood election, and non-committal Economy Secretary Keith Brown only won\u0026nbspafter a redistribution of ballots.  However Ms Sturgeon, who says she has a \"triple-lock mandate\" to call a referendum by 2021, said she still expected another vote while she was First Minister.  The \u0026ldquostop obsessing message, amid opposition claims Ms Sturgeon\u0026rsquos independence plans have stalled, reinforced more subtle comments to the SNP conference on Saturday.  Then, Ms Sturgeon told activists that, until the \u0026ldquofog of Brexit lifted, they had a responsibility  \u0026ldquonot just to focus on the \u0026lsquowhen\u0026rsquo of independence, but to use our energy and passion to persuade those who still ask \u0026lsquowhy?\u0026rsquo Right now, that is the more important task.  After the SNP lost a third of its MPs in the general election, Ms Sturgeon \u0026ldquoreset her March 2017 plan for another referendum linked to Brexit.  She said she would set out her view on \u0026ldquothe precise timetable for offering people a choice over the country\u0026rsquos future when Brexit came into focus this autumn.  But on the BBC One\u0026rsquos Andrew Marr show she appeared to row back from that, saying she would not even consider the issue until there was more clarity.  The SNP leader was asked whether it was possible to have a second referendum before Scotland left the EU as part of Brexit in March 2019.  She said: \u0026ldquoAnything in life is possible, but .. I feel that the uncertainty around Brexit right now is such that we shouldn\u0026rsquot make any decisions on timing about a possible second independence referendum, and I\u0026rsquove said I won\u0026rsquot give that any further consideration until we get more clarity, which I hope will be sooner rather than later.  \u0026ldquoWhat I was saying to my party conference yesterday was let\u0026rsquos stop obsessing all of the time about when we might get the chance to vote on independence again.  \u0026ldquoInstead let\u0026rsquos engage people in the substantive arguments, let\u0026rsquos address people who still ask the question \u0026lsquowhy should Scotland be independent?\u0026rsquo.  \u0026ldquoThis is a very good time to have a debate that is focused on maximising our opportunities as a country, rather than just resigning ourselves to the inevitable damage that Brexit seems destined to do to us.  Press on the timing, given Brexit could mean an independent Scotland having to reapply for EU membership, Ms Sturgeon was asked if there was enough time between her looking at the timing issue in the autumn and March 2019 to hold a referendum.  She said: \u0026ldquoNo, but even if doesn\u0026rsquot happen before then Scotland will still have options.  Asked if she was effectively ruling out a referendum until after Brexit, she said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom not sure that\u0026rsquos a conclusion anybody should necessarily reach.  Ms Sturgeon also said that she was writing to Speaker John Bercow asking for a vote on the devolved \u0026lsquopower grab\u0026rsquo in the EU Withdrawal Bill, which returns to the Commons on Tuesday.  She said the Bill, which Holyrood has refused to endorse, was \u0026ldquounconstitutional as it stands, given the conventions which underpin devolution.  She said: \u0026ldquoThis is quite an important issue of principle. This is not about giving the Scottish Parliament new powers or extra powers, it is simply about safeguarding the powers we already have.  Later, on Sky news with Sophie Ridge, Mr Sturgeon was asked whether there would be a second referendum while she was First Minister.  She replied: \u0026ldquoI think there will be. I think Scotland will become independent. My view is that that is the direction of travel. But on the question of timing, for the last 12 months, I\u0026rsquove been saying very clearly that I don\u0026rsquot think it\u0026rsquos right to consider that decision while things are so unclear and so uncertain around Brexit.  \u0026ldquoSo as First Minister I won\u0026rsquot give consideration to the timing until we\u0026rsquove got some Brexit clarity. The message I was giving to my party at our conference is that that gives us an opportunity, not to worry all the time about when we might vote again on independence, but instead to engage on the substance of the arguments, and to address people in Scotland who still ask why we should be independent.  \u0026ldquoI think that debate is timely because there\u0026rsquos going to be change. Brexit makes that inevitable. Most people think Brexit will make the country poorer. So this is an opportunity to look at whether there\u0026rsquos a better alternative for Scotland, and focus on hope and optimism and how we maximise our potential as a country. So that\u0026rsquos the opportunity I was encouraging my party to grasp when I spoke to them yesterday.  On BBC Sunday Politics Scotland, SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford refused to say if there would be a referendum before the next Holyrood election.  He said there needed to be more clarity over Brexit, adding: \u0026ldquoThe people of Scotland will determine when the time is right for that. It will happen at the right time."}]
