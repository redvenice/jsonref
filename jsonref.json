A paper published by SAGE last week suggested two doses of the Pfizer vaccine is good enough to protect against all known variants.Public Health England\u0027s Dr Susan Hopkins said the agency was \u0027still investigating\u0027 the cases and added there is \u0027no evidence that the variant causes more severe disease or renders the vaccines currently deployed any less effective\u0027. \u0027The numbers are still low but certainly in London right now, B.1.617 and its subtypes are the only variant that appears to be growing,\u0027 Professor Pagel told MailOnline yesterday. \u0027That could be because it is outcompeting other strains, including the dominant Kent strain, or it could be circumstantial in that there were some spreading events that happened that, just by chance, were the Indian strain.\u0027However, I think the experience of India and now its neighbours do provide plenty of reason to be cautious and assume that B.1.617 is more transmissible.\u0027PHE has designated the Indian strains \u0027variants under investigation\u0027 because they are not well understood. The Kent and South Africa variants are \u0027variants of concern\u0027 because they are known to spread faster and escape some types of immunity – this means officials do surge testing to stamp out the South Africa variant when it\u0027s found, but they don\u0027t currently for India. Another 357,229 Covid cases and 3,449 new fatalities were recorded by the health ministry in India yesterday but medics believe the real figures could be between five and 10 times higher. Some have suggested the fast-spreading Kent variant could be behind the surge – similar patterns were seen when it took hold in the UK and Europe.But others say it was a perfect storm of rules that weren\u0027t tight enough, people\u0027s inability to keep social distancing and also new variants emerging. Data from the Wellcome Sanger Institute suggests it detected 100 test samples with the Indian variants in the most recent week, up from 52 in the week to April 10. This does not include tests from people travelling internationally.During that time the proportion of national cases they accounted for rose from one per cent to 2.4 per cent. Dr Pagel also said the proportion nationally was slightly higher, at around 4 per cent.This ate into the market share of the Kent variant, which fell from 97.8 to 96.2 per cent of cases. The Brazil and South Africa variants together account for less than one per cent.They have now been found in dozens of local authorities across the country with hotspots in London and the Midlands, and Public Health England has officially confirmed 400 infections caused by the viruses.As well as Lambeth (46 per cent of cases) and Harrow (36 per cent), the Indian variants also made up large proportions in Eastleigh, Hampshire (31 per cent) Bromley (25 per cent) Bolton (24 per cent) Stafford, Haringey and Hounslow (22 per cent).Professor Pagel: \u0027It rapidly became dominant in India and, again the sequenced data there is sparse, but early modelling shows that it might well be more transmissible than our B.117 Kent strain. \u0027What we have also seen in India is that B.1.617.2 is becoming the dominant subtype – exactly the same pattern we see here in the UK. \u0027While this could reflect the situation in India through importation, the Sanger data tries to exclude travel related cases or surge testing and we still the rise of B.1.617.2 in that.\u0027So we cannot be definitive. But that doesn\u0027t mean we should be complacent either – as so often with Covid, waiting to be absolutely sure is waiting too long.\u0027          Although the Sanger Institute data tries to filter out test results from people who have travelled internationally, its numbers likely reflect cases that are parts of clusters than began with a traveller.  India is now on Britain\u0027s red list, meaning only UK residents and citizens are allowed to make the journey into the country. They must quarantine for 10 days in a hotel and test themselves three times – before departure and then twice during self-isolation."},{"url":null,"title":"Coronavirus real world data proves Pfizer Covid jab 77 98 effective","story":"Share this article  Paul Hunter, professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia, said: \u0027It\u0027s very positive...

Q: It looks like this recession will be much less severe with much less scarring than the one after the 2008 financial crisis. Why? Andrew Bailey says research shows that recessions linked to financial crises tend to be more severe and have a longer-lasting impact.  We have not had a financial crisis this time - the reforms introduced after the last crisis have stood the test, Bailey replies. There was a lot of debate last summer about the prospect of a V-shaped recovery -- and some criticism that the Bank was too optimistic, Bailey says. But today, the ‘basic mechanics’ of that shape of recovery remain reasonably strong, partly on the back of a “hugely successful vaccination programme”, Bailey adds -- although a year ago, the return of Covid (causing the current lockdown) wasn’t expected.Andrew Bailey says the UK hasn’t seen a bounceback quite of this nature in modern times.  The strong growth recorded in 1941 was heavily influenced by wartime conditions, he points out, explaining: We possibly saw some of those effects during the Industrial Revolution, Bailey continues (he did his PhD on this period). But the important point is that this is a bounceback from 2020, Bailey adds. Governor Bailey explains that there are a lot of uncertainties, beyond the pandemic itself. There are very big questions about the path of supply and demand, and the structure of the economy, depending how many of the changes in spending and working patterns remain, and which do not. So the Bank will watch it very carefully.Governor Andrew Bailey says it’s important to put today’s forecast of a faster recovery into proper context. Given the UK had such a large fall in output last year, it is good news that we’re getting a recovery this year, he explains. However, “let’s not get carried away”, he adds. It takes the UK back, by the end of this year, to the level of output at the end of 2019, pre-Covid. These projections are conditioned on Covid restrictions in the UK being eased in the near term, with most lifted by the end of Q2. Bailey warns that there are risks to its forecasts - including the possibility of renewed waves of infections in the UK and other countries. On balance, the MPC judges the risks to its GDP forecast are skewed to the downside in the first year of the forecast, but ‘broadly balanced’ further out.  Bailey also explains that extending the furlough scheme will limit the rise in unemployment this year, with most workers on furlough expected to return to work later this year as the scheme ends (as flagged earlier).Charles Hepworth, investment director at GAM Investments, says it’s a ‘big upgrade’ Silvia Dall’Angelo, senior economist at the International Business of Federated Hermes, says the latest stimulus measures are supporting growth:  Dean Turner, Economist at UBS Global Wealth Management, predicts that interest rates will still remain low for some time, though: The central bank said it would slow its bond-buying to £3.4bn a week between May and August, down from its current pace of £4.4bn. This downward revision “largely reflects” the extension of the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme and the Self-Employment Income Support Scheme in the Budget, the Bank says. This fan chart shows the latest forecasts for unemployment and inflation (darker areas are more likely). It now predicts the economy shrank by less than expected in the first three month of this year, during the lockdown, followed by a sharp recovery in April-June. And it also predicts the economy will recover to pre- Covid levels in the fourth quarter of 2021, as pandemic restrictions are lifted. Its new forecasts predict that UK GDP “recovers materially as Covid-related restrictions are eased”. Here’s the details: But chief economist Andy Haldane (who is leaving to become chief executive of the Royal Society of Arts thinktank) wanted to lower the size of the programme. But the Bank is slowing the pace of its bond-buying, as some economists had predicted might happen.

With the global secondhand clothing market set to grow from $28bn (£20bn) to $64bn (£46bn) by 2024, wardrobes could be largely made up of secondhand items – rented or bought. Natalie-Anne Hasseck, co-founder of the fashion rental subscription service Onloan, credits the change in consumer behaviour to a move away from status to “pleasure” dressing. During lockdown, demand for knitwear rocketed, but so did the loaning of flamboyant pieces. “The bigger the collar, the better,” she says. “We had a Mother of Pearl pie-crust collar shirt that barely touched ground in our warehouse as it just kept being rented out on repeat. Our customers care less about trends and more about identity and personalisation.” Better communication from brands is needed, as is a more unified industry approach to what constitutes a “sustainable” brand. “In our marketing materials, we promote to our customers how to live more sustainably,” says Lucy Macnamara, founder of ethical womenswear brand Aspiga. “We hosted a series of Instagram Lives with celebrities and influencers about changes we can make in our daily lives to live more eco-friendly.” Fast fashion brands are now facing a new challenge: being less wasteful is on trend. Couttigane says she has seen an increase in the willingness to shop secondhand, largely because platforms such as Depop – a community-led marketplace, renowned for good-quality secondhand and original vintage clothes – make the experience accessible, inclusive and desirable. “We want to use our reach to influence the way we consume fashion, encouraging people to consider secondhand first,” says Justine Porterie, Depop’s head of sustainability. An important factor in extending the life of clothes is how we care for them. The ecological cleaning brand Ecover has relaunched its laundry detergents made with biodegradable and plant-based ingredients. “Every 30 seconds, 1,000 items of clothing are thrown away in the UK,” says Ecover’s senior brand manager Charlotte Snelgrove. “We want to challenge the nation to wash right, wear more and waste less.” Find out more at ecoverdepop"},{"url":null,"title":"you dont know what story an item tells why im buying and selling secondhand clothes","story":"Bennett is the founder of online vintage shop Soul and Flare, which joined Depop – a community-led marketplace, renowned for good-quality secondhand and original vintage clothes – in 2016. Standing out and making sure her offering was of the highest quality was even more important for Bennett once she had started her Depop shop. And one of the biggest aims and values of her company is to eliminate fashion waste by encouraging others to shop vintage and look after the clothes they already own. She doesn’t see her job as “just” buying and selling vintage, though. For Bennett, the process is a full circle of discovery and care – from the items she chooses, to the way she washes and mends them. Before any repairs begin, the clothes need to be washed and cleaned delicately. “I’m an avid repair seamstress, but the process is about not over-washing clothes, as well,” she explains. The wrong detergent with too many harsh chemicals can spell the end for delicate vintage fabrics. Bennett believes that treating vintage clothes correctly is the only way to preserve them for future owners. Some of the vintage clothes that Bennett sells have been worn on and off for up to 70 years – something of a miracle and testament to their quality as well as how they’re looked after, she says. The last thing you’d want to do is just throw them in the washing machine with any old detergent. That’s why she has a clear system – first up is checking the label and material to see if it’s washable, and whether it should be hand washed. Then it’s about using the right cleaning products. Bennett is committed to using products that are eco-friendly – she’s stopped using bleach at home completely, and only uses Ecover detergent, made with plant-based, biodegradable ingredients as it’s gentle on the vintage fabrics as well as kinder to the environment. Bennett is based in Nottingham, where her love of vintage began with visits to car boot sales and charity shops with her mum, before she worked in a vintage shop. Nowadays, wearing secondhand or pre-loved can be quite a badge of honour, but in decades past it was often seen as something to hide. For some, buying vintage from a company such as Soul and Flare is a new experience, but Bennett has been learning her trade for a long time, meaning she really knows what she’s talking about. “I’ve been running Soul and Flare for around five years solidly but have been in the vintage trade for more than a decade. I fell into it in many ways but, growing up, my mum would drag us around charity shops and car boot sales. In her own way, she was sustainable even if she didn’t know what the word meant then. When I left college, I was making items for friends and family, and eventually got a job at a vintage clothing shop as their rework seamstress, and that’s where it stemmed from. That’s when I started witnessing the vast amounts of clothing that we waste in the UK, and my passion for reviving, repairing and making clothing last began. It’s not just something I do as a job, I do it at home, too – it’s my lifestyle. I look after my possessions – whether that’s furniture or clothing – and everything I wear is secondhand, so it’s deep-rooted in me. Ecover has teamed up with Depop, the marketplace app where you can buy and sell unique fashion, to challenge the nation to extend the life of their clothing and help fight fashion waste.

How we clean also has an impact. The process of doing laundry can impact the environment from the moment you turn the machine on. Higher temperatures create a higher carbon footprint, while the wrong wash setting can damage clothes, meaning you need to discard or replace them sooner. And the more clothes we buy, the more we wash. Throwaway culture is turning our planet into a giant fabric landfill. According to charity Wrap, 1,000 items of clothing are thrown away every 30 seconds in the UK. Leslie Reichert, from Massachusetts, who made herself a name as a green cleaning coach, says that altering the way you wash your clothes might not seem a big eco move, but for some it could be the perfect place to start. “Changes in the way you do your laundry are easy to implement and make a difference. By using an eco-friendly laundry soap, you can reduce the impact on the environment from the wash and you don’t need fabric softener.” Charlotte Snelgrove, senior brand manager at Ecover UK, says: “We’re never resting on our laurels, as a business we realise we can always improve on our products and push ourselves to go further in reducing our impact and finding new innovative ways to do this. We see our role in the cleaning category as highlighting environmental issues and trying to lead change by pioneering eco innovation and showing what is possible and hope bigger brands follow.” The world has taken notice, and eco influencers are getting on board. Georgina Wilson-Powell, founder and editor of the sustainable living magazine Pebble, says the brand has been leading the way for many years. “I’ve always been impressed with Ecover’s investment in innovation, both in packaging and detergents, as both can have such a negative impact on our environment. As more and more consumers look for brands that match their growing environmental credentials, it’s great to see Ecover build on its years of experience in this area,” she says. With the launch of its laundry detergent range, Ecover has gone back to basics, looking at its core value of cleaning, and how it impacts the environment. As well as continuing to use biodegradable, plant-based ingredients, Ecover’s fabric softeners contain a palm oil-free softening active derived from rapeseed oil and are vegan-friendly. The new Ecover bio detergent includes powerful enzymes that help your clothes last longer by fighting stains and removing bobbling from cotton fibres after multiple washes. There are active steps consumers can take, too – for instance, shorter wash cycles have been proved to help clothes last longer and shed fewer fibres. It’s a lot to think about when you’re just washing your clothes, but it’s something the world is waking up to, says Reichert. “Years ago, I was considered an ‘outlier’ due to my ideas about green cleaning – today, most manufacturers have eco-friendly options for consumers. Even the huge corporations have seen that there is a demand for green products. It’s not a movement, it’s a tsunami.” Ecover is on a mission to liberate the value of our clothing by challenging the nation to wash wisely, wear longer and waste less.

The PA Media news agency quoted the prime minister as saying:  The stakes are too high for Cop26 to become some sort of last-minute dash to the line. Johnson said countries should spend the next six months leading up to the talks “untangling the knots and unblocking some of the stickiest issues”.  Anas Sarwar, the leader of Scottish Labour, voted at his local polling place at Pollokshields Burgh Hall in Glasgow on Thursday morning. He is standing against Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minister, in the Glasgow Southside constituency, which includes Pollokshields. Nicola Sturgeon had already voted by post but she joined SNP candidate Roza Salih at Annette Street primary school polling place in Govanhill, Glasgow, to lend her support and meet a Syrian family as they cast their ballots. This year’s poll is the first in which people with refugee status are entitled to vote.  The Scottish Greens co-leader Patrick Harvie cast his ballot at Notre Dame primary school in Glasgow’s west end. Arriving on his bike, Harvie posed for press photographers before entering the polling place, wearing a face mask bearing the LGBT rainbow flag. After voting, and at the behest of the photographers, Harvie rode a bike pulling a small billboard adorned with his face.  The Alba party leader, Alex Salmond, cast his ballot in Strichen, Aberdeenshire. He told reporters he had put forward a “positive case” for “urgency” on Scottish independence. Questioned about his feelings on returning to his local polling station with the Alba party on the ballot paper, Salmond said it was a “different experience, but a familiar one”, adding: “Polling day is always an exciting day.”  The Scottish Liberal Democrat leader, Willie Rennie, has already voted by post. British naval patrol vessels arrived in the waters around Jersey on Thursday as scores of French boats gathered at the port in St Helier to protest against post-Brexit fishing rights.  It followed French threats to cut off electricity to Jersey, a self-governing dependency of the UK off the tip of northern France. French fishers are protesting over new licences issued on Friday that restrict for the first time the number of days they can operate in shared waters. Unionist campaigners have spent tens of thousands of pounds urging pro-UK voters to act tactically. Two of Labour’s three constituency seats, East Lothian and Dumbarton, are at significant risk of falling to the SNP several Tory seats in the north-east are also highly vulnerable. That implies the Scottish Tory strategy of amplifying the prospects of an SNP majority and a second independence referendum has worked the Tories have urged unionist voters to lend their regional list votes to the party to thwart the SNP’s ambitions. These data suggest pro-UK voters are reacting to the SNP’s substantial 25-point lead in the opinion polls. Coupled with an increase in a backing for the Scottish Greens on the regional lists, there is widespread agreement pro-independence parties are likely to win a majority today. Its spokesperson Vivian Loonela said that under the trade and cooperation agreement, any new specific conditions that limit EU fishing activity in UK waters “need to comply with the objectives and principles” that have been set out. Toby Porter said he cast his vote in Oxford at 7.25am but the normal polling station was not up and running until 7.30am. He said about a dozen people voted in the car before the centre at the Oxford Centre for Mission Studies was opened. He told the PA news agency: Laura Lock, the deputy chief executive of the Association of Electoral Administrators, said some polling stations in cars are seen at each election. A spokesman for Oxford city council said: “The keyholder overslept and for a short time at 7am electors were voting using the POs’ (presiding officers) cars. This is standard procedure when a station building isn’t open on time and part of the training we give them. The key is that ballot papers are ready to be issued at 7am, wherever that may be. The building was open within 15 minutes.”Earlier, dozens of French fishing boats gathered off the Jersey capital, St Helier, amid fears they were preparing to blockade the harbour. Jersey’s external relations minister, Ian Gorst, said he would be speaking to the French fishers in an attempt to defuse the worsening row. He told BBC News: HMS Severn and HMS Tamar have been deployed by the UK government to “monitor the situation”. The row erupted after the Jersey government said French fishing boats would be required to obtain a licence to fish in the island’s waters under the terms of the UK’s post-Brexit trade deal with the EU that came into force last week. It caused anger in the French fishing communities, who complained boats that had operated there for years were suddenly having their access to the fisheries restricted. Johnson, who has regularly referred to these elections when trying to ert attention away from recent allegations of corruption, also shared a video on Twitter encouraging people to go out and vote Conservative: Keir Starmer’s team point out that the feelgood factor from the vaccine rollout, and the relaxing of restrictions on voters’ everyday lives, would be a challenging backdrop for any opposition party. And they insist his is a long-term project of restoring Labour to winning form by the time of the next general election. Starmer himself has repeatedly said he and his colleagues have “a mountain to climb”, and his allies are pinning their hopes for today’s elections on modest gains far away from the “red wall”, in Scotland and the south of England. The Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar voted at his local polling station at Pollokshields Burgh Hall in Glasgow on Thursday morning. Sarwar is standing against the first minister Nicola Sturgeon in the Glasgow Southside constituency, which includes Pollokshields. Flanked by his wife and four-year-old son, Sarwar was in a buoyant mood, chatting with voters and answering questions from journalists. He urged people to cast their votes for Labour.  Sturgeon has already voted by post but joined SNP candidate Rosa Salih at Annette Street Primary School polling station in Govanhill, Glasgow, to lend her support and meet a Syrian family as they cast their ballots. The Scottish Greens co-leader Lorna Slater will vote at a primary school in Edinburgh, while her fellow co-leader Patrick Harvie will vote at a school in Glasgow. The Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross will vote in Moray, while the Alba Party leader Alex Salmond cast his ballot in Strichen, Aberdeenshire. The Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie has already voted by post.He arrived on foot at the Greenwood Centre in Kentish Town at 9.30am, accompanied by his wife Victoria. He left the building around four minutes later and walked away hand-in-hand with his wife while followed by photographers. Asked by a reporter how he was feeling, Starmer said: “Good”. People also go to the polls in local elections, mayoral and police and crime commissioner elections across England. Please keep posting your comments below, but don’t say how you voted.

The three cases of the Brazilian variant were detected in Poland’s southern Silesia region, said the health minister, Adam Niedzielski. Poland has so far reported 2,818,378 Covid cases and 68,993 deaths, Reuters reports. Poland reopened shopping centres in May, the beginning of a gradual unfreezing of the economy that will see restaurants, hotels and schools reopening at different points this month. The rise began in March, in line with the start of the first lockdown, and the rates for the rest of the year remained significantly higher than previous years.

As far as I know, we are the first hospital in Italy to have started. It is a first step towards the vaccination of all migrants, present in the area, who have the right to health, like everyone else. It is not possible to believe in first and second class human beings.” A number of charities and UN agencies have in recent months raised the issue of migrant vaccination, saying: “No one is safe until everyone is.” The UN migration agency (IOM) has called on governments to count and include all migrants present in their territories – regardless of legal immigration status – in national Covid-19 vaccine distribution plans. “Vaccines are one of our most important and cost-effective tools to prevent outbreaks, protect iniduals and therefore keep entire communities safe and healthy,” said the IOM director general, António Vitorino. “Protecting the most vulnerable from health risks is critical for everyone’s safety.” According to the Italian Institute for International Political Studies (ISPI), in Italy today there are about 600,000 undocumented migrants. In the country, up until 2020, there are currently more than 1 million non-EU citizens with temporary residence permits. “The time has come to make people understand that vaccinations cannot have bureaucratic barriers and that one cannot think of prioritising vaccinations on the basis of an identity card,” added Prestileo, ‘ “because the virus affects everyone, regardless of their passport. We must all get vaccinated in order to defeat it.”Following warnings by health officials earlier this week that the country was on the brink of losing control of its outbreak, Nepal has appealed for urgent international help. As the country reported its highest daily number of new infections – 8,605 – the prime minister, KP Sharma Oli, who has been criticised for his handling of the crisis, asked the army to help manage emergency facilities to take pressure off the health system.

LFD tests are swab tests that give results in 30 minutes or less without the need for processing in a laboratory. The number of LFD tests peaked at just over 7.6m in the week to 17 March, which coincided with the return of secondary students to school, PA Media reports. Since 9 April, everyone in England has been eligible for rapid Covid-19 tests twice a week. By contrast, 960,867 polymerase chain reaction tests – swab tests that are processed in a laboratory – were conducted in the week to 28 April.The World Athletics president, Sebastian Coe, said he believes the Games will go ahead safely after attending a half marathon test event in Sapporo on Wednesday.

Photograph: Tom HonanCars will be permanently banned from several areas around Grafton Street in Dublin from May 24th, ahead of the resumption of outdoor dining in June.However, while South William Street, Drury Street, South Anne Street and Dame Court would all have car free areas, their full pedestrianisation has been curtailed because some car park owners, including Brown Thomas said they could not facilitate the measures.Parts of these four streets, as well as Duke Street, were pedestrianised on a trial basis over weekends last July and August, with parking spaces turned into outdoor seating areas for cafes and restaurants to accommodate more people during the Covid-19 restrictions.Dublin City Council held a public consultation process on the plans last November and 97 per cent of respondents were in favour of their implementation.The council had initially hoped to have the measures in place ahead of the easing of Level 5 restrictions last December, but this was delayed until January. The plans were put on hold again when restrictions were reintroduced. Work has now begun with a view to completion in just over three weeks time. Fully pedestrianisedUnder the council’s plans, South Anne Street will be fully pedestrianised, as it was during the trial. Dame Court, the street that runs from Exchequer Street down to the Stag’s Head pub, would also be fully pedestrianised. Drury Street will be pedestrianised just after its junction with Fade Street to the Drury Street underground carpark.The South William Street pedestrian zone will be substantially smaller than during the trials. It had been pedestrianised between the Brown Thomas carpark exit and Chatham Row, but this required reversing the direction of vehicles leaving the car park, with a stopgo system in place at Exchequer Street.The council said it asked the car-park owners if it would be possible to reverse their entry and exit arrangements to make South William Street an entry point to the car park with exit from Clarendon Street. “This would then allow for the majority of the street to be pedestrianised,” the council said.The car-park owners said doing so would pose “insurmountable structural difficulties that cannot be overcome”. In addition they said the trials caused considerable congestion internally to the car park and its business dropped by 30 per cent from the first week of the trial.As a result, only the small area between the car-park exit and Exchequer Street, a 30 metre stretch, will be pedestrianised from 11am. However, the only vehicles using the street will be those exiting from the Brown Thomas car park.Only one business used the outdoor furniture on Duke Street during the trial. There is also a private car park, a delivery yard and construction site that require access, the council said, and it decided not to go ahead with the street’s permanent pedestrianisation.Merrion RowMeanwhile the council is to implement a trial of traffic restrictions on Merrion Row, following an overwhelmingly positive response to outdoor dining proposals for the street.The council last month held a consultation process on plans to reduce traffic on Dublin’s Merrion Row to one lane to facilitate summer outdoor dining. It received more than 2,400 submissions, 93 per cent of which were in favour of the plans. On May 15th and 16th, the three traffic lanes on the road will be reduced to one. This will involve the redirection of traffic onto Hume Street and Ely Place from St Stephen’s Green to avoid bottlenecks on Merrion Row.Dublin City Council said it had been approached by businesses on Merrion Row seeking the full pedestrianisation of the street to facilitate outdoor dining. However, it said the National Transport Authority had advised that the removal of buses from the street was “not feasible from an operational point of view”.Instead the council is proposing to keep traffic on the one-way street, but restrict them to one lane, with space on both sides of the road to be made available for outdoor furniture, if the trial is successful.The council said it is working on plans to increase pedestrian and dining space in other parts of the city. Temple Bar businesses are preparing to submit a proposal to the council which would facilitate up to 3,000 diners on the streets in the cultural quarter."},{"url":null,"title":"covid 19 vaccine tracker what s available in the republic of ireland and what else is coming","story":"It has been over a year since the first case of Covid-19 was confirmed in the Republic of Ireland. Since then, over 250,000 people have been diagnosed in the State, and more than 4,900 people have died.Globally, over 150 million people have been diagnosed and over 3\u0026nbspmillion have died since the virus was first identified in China in December 2019.Four of these have been authorised for use in the EU - one from AstraZeneca, one from BioNTech-Pfizer, one from Moderna and another from Johnson \u0026amp Johnson (Jannsen).The EU has put in place purchase agreements with Sanofi-GSK\u0026nbspand Curevac, and\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspis also in talks with two other vaccine producers - Novavax and Valneva.Ireland, along with all other EU member states, will get a proportional amount of every vaccine that is approved for use by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) according to its population.But how do these other vaccines work, and when will they be approved for use here? Have there been any reported side effects? And when can you expect to receive a vaccine?The  Vaccine Tracker will be updated daily as the country embarks on the largest inoculation programme in the history of the State.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 70°C.EMA approval: Granted on December 21st.Overview: Developed by New York-based Pfizer and German company BioNTech this vaccine has a brand name of Comirnaty. It uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which has instructions for producing a protein from Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The person’s immune system recognises this protein as foreign and produces antibodies and activates T-cells (white blood cells) to attack it, giving them immunity. The vaccine will last for six months when stored at -70C, and five days when stored at between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. The EU has approved the withdrawal of six doses from each vial.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle and joint pain, chills and fever. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 546,000 in April, 738,000 in May and\u0026nbsp844,000 doses in June, with 5.4 million doses in total expected by the end of 2021.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 20°C.EMA approval: Granted on January 6th.Overview: Developed by Boston-based company Moderna, this vaccine is manufactured for EU states at partner plants in Switzerland, France and Spain before being distributed across the continent. Like the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, it uses mRNA technology to produce a Sars-CoV-2 protein, which the body then attacks to give immunity. It will last for up to six months when stored at - 20°C. The first Moderna vaccine was given in Ireland on January 16th.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, chills, fever, swollen or tender lymph nodes under the arm, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea and vomiting. Less common was redness, hives and rash at the injection site. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 383,000 by June and 870,000 doses by the end of 2021.How many have been vaccinated here?EMA approval: Granted on January 29th.Overview: The OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine was thought of as a potential game-changer because it can be transported and stored at 2 degrees to 8 degrees for up to six months, making it much easier to move around and administer. It is also much cheaper, costing about $3-4 per shot, compared with $20 for the PfizerBioNTech jab, with the former being made on a not-for-profit basis for the duration of the pandemic.It is based on a harmless chimp cold virus that cannot grow inside human cells. Scientists have tweaked this virus so that it carries genetic material containing the instructions for a protein of the coronavirus. Once the vaccine has been administered, our bodies produce the coronavirus protein, triggering an immune response.During the trial, a dosing error led to the serendipitous finding that when clinical trial participants were given half a dose followed by a full dose, the vaccine had a higher efficacy than when participants were given two full doses, with 90 per cent efficacy in the former case and 62 per cent efficacy in the latter. This led AstraZeneca to announce in November a new global trial of the vaccine with the half dosefull dose regime.In January, a bitter row broke out between the European Union and AstraZeneca after the pharmaceutical company drastically revised downwards the number of doses it could deliver the bloc.\u0026nbspWhile the EMA approved the use of this vaccine for all ages, doubt was cast over its efficacy in the over 65s due to the lack of data from Astrazeneca’s clinical trials in this cohort. As a result, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Poland and Belgium have opted not to approve this product for their older population.Following suit, Ireland has also decided to use the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine for the over 70s where possible, not the AstraZeneca jab.It would not be the first time this jab led to a\u0026nbspsignificant reorganisation of our vaccination plans.Reports of serious blood clots, mostly in women aged under 60, led the\u0026nbspNational Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac) to first defer the use of the vaccine on March 14th, before resuming it\u0027s use on March 20th.However, on April 12th, Niac\u0026nbsprecommended that AstraZeneca should not be given to people aged under 60, once again leading to a reorganisation of the rollout. This was revised to people aged over 50 on April 27th.\u0026nbspHow many will Ireland get?\u0026nbspLatest projections are 224,000 in April, 262,000 in May and 327,000 in JuneStorage: Lasts for up to two years frozen at –20° C, and up to three months refrigerated at 2–8° C.EMA approval: Approved on March 11th.Overview: The EMA started a rolling review of this single dose vaccine from Janssen, the Belgium-based subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson on December 1st .On January 29th the company announced the results of its Phase 3 trial: the vaccine had an efficacy of 72 per cent in the United States, 66 per cent in Latin America, and 57 per cent in South Africa.This vaccine uses double-stranded DNA to deliver a protein from the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the body, thereby creating immunity. It is different from others on the market in that it requires just one injection. The EU has agreed an initial contract for 200 million doses, with an option to buy 200 million more.On February 16th the company applied to the EMA for\u0026nbspseeking authorisation for its single-dose vaccine, and it was approved on March 11th.However, on April 13th the company paused deliveries of its vaccine in Europe pending an investigation of rare blood clot cases that have halted its rollout in the US. The blood clotting conditions reported in recipients of the Johnson \u0026amp Johnson vaccine in the US are the same rare condition linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine.On April 20th, the EMA\u0027s review of these issues found a possible link to very rare cases of unusual blood clots with low blood platelets, and agreed a warning should be included in the product information.\u0026nbspHowever, it concluded\u0026nbspthe overall benefits of the vaccine\u0026nbspin preventing Covid-19 outweigh the risks of side effects, and so Janssen announced it would resume deliveries to the EU. In Ireland,\u0026nbspNiac recommended that the jab be used only for people over the age of 50.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbsp2.2 million doses in total,\u0026nbsp600,000 between April and June.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: US company Novavax has developed a Covid-19 vaccine which stimulates an immune response by delivering spike proteins into the body. These spike-proteins are grown and harvested from insects. Similar technology is used in the production of vaccines for influenza and HPV. The European Commission has concluded exploratory talks with Novavax with a view to purchasing up to 200 million doses. The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 3rd.Overview: In September the EU signed a deal to purchase 300 million doses of this vaccine. It is based on the same technology as one of Sanofi’s seasonal influenza vaccines - more conventional than the mRNA used by Pfizer and Moderna - and it was thought it could play a big role in ending the pandemic. However, despite positive results from Phase 1 trials, news came in December that Phase 2 trial results showed an insufficient immune response in older adults. Phase III studies were expected to start in December, but the companies now plan to begin a phase 2b study in February with a different formulation of the vaccine. Even if their new formulation is successful, they do not expect the vaccine to be available until the end of 2021.Storage: Will last for at least 3 months at 2–8°C.Overview: The German company CureVac began its final Phase 3 trials in December, with results expected in the first quarter of 2021. It uses the same mRNA technology as the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, but can be kept at normal refrigerator temperatures. The company has signed a deal with the EU to supply 405 million doses, pending regulatory approval.The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 12th.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: Valneva is a French company which has created a Covid-19 vaccine based on their Japanese encephalitis vaccine. It delivers a chemically inactivated coronavirus and uses an adjuvant (immunity booster) to create immunity. It entered clinical trials in December and reported positive results from these initial phase 1 and 2 trial in\u0026nbspApril 2021, while announcing it was entering\u0026nbspphase 3 trials on 4,000 people.On January 12th the European Commission concluded exploratory talks with the company for the supply of 30 million doses, with the option to buy a further 30 million.When might you be vaccinated?The HSE is currently vaccinating people in the top five cohorts:\u0026nbsppeople aged 65\u0026nbspand older who live in long-term care facilities (cohort 1), frontline healthcare workers (cohort 2), people aged 70 and older (cohort 3), people aged 16 to 69 who are at very high risk (cohort 4) and those aged 60 to 69 (cohort 5).\u0026nbspThe next groups to be offered a vaccine after this will be\u0026nbsppeople\u0026nbspaged 16 to 64 who are at high risk (cohort 7).

File photograph: Thomas KienzleAFP via Getty ImagesThe Government could be on a collision course with the State’s powerful pharmaceutical industry over support for US backing of a move to lift patent protection on Covid-19 vaccines.The Biden administration has thrown its support behind the move that would allow other companies to make the jabs but reduce the profits of the pharmaceutical giants behind the vaccines.US trade representative Katherine Tai said that it would support the waiver of intellectual property protections on vaccines “to help end the pandemic” and that the US would participate in negotiations on the move at the World Trade Organisation, which sets the rules for global trade.“Extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures,” said Ms Tai.The slow pace of the rollout of the vaccines and shortages in the global supply have put pressure on governments to look to new measures as some countries face new surges in infections.Intellectual property is the valuable creative asset behind the development of innovative medicines. Patents protect the creators of those assets by giving them the benefit of a short-term monopoly on the sale of the vaccines to cover the cost of the development and to encourage further investment.Supporters of the patent waiver argue that it would allow the manufacturing of vaccines to be increased dramatically and provide more affordable supplies to less wealthy countries.PoliticalMinister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney described the announcement by the US trade representative and the Biden administration as “very significant”.“It won’t solve all Covid vaccine manufacturing and supply issues, but it is a step and the right decision in response to a global demand emergency,” he tweeted.Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly retweeted Ms Tai’s tweet about the US move, describing it as a “hugely positive development.”Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment Leo Varadkar said the decision of the US administration to support a waiver “is very significant and should cause the EU and other developed countries to reassess their position”.Urging caution however, he said in the Dáil that “our strong view is that Covax is the best way to do this, the international partnership”.Mr Varadkar said “very few countries in the global south have the infrastructural know-how or the materials to make those vaccines and there’s no point in giving somebody a recipe if they don’t have the kitchen or the cooking skills or the ingredients.”The Trips (trade-related intellectual property rights) waiver “is definitely an option”, he told Social Democrats TD Jennifer Whitmore and People Before Profit TD Paul Murphy.But “what we want to do is take actions that do good, not just actions that look good or make us feel good. And we think the best way to do that is to involve the pharmaceutical companies, the scientists and universities in the solution, a solution that will actually allow more vaccines to be made particularly in the global south.”World Health Organisation director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus described the Biden administration’s backing as “a monumental moment in the fight against Covid-19.”He said it was a “powerful example” of the US leadership to address global health challenges.European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has said that the bloc is “ready to discuss any proposals that address the crisis in an effective and pragmatic manner.”French president Emmanuel Macron said that he was “absolutely in favour” of the plan.India and South Africa are leading a group of countries that have, for several months, been pushing for patents on vaccines to be set aside in a move they argue would increase vaccine production around the world. More than 100 countries support the proposal.Pharma oppositionCritics of the waiver argue that sharing details around the creative process behind the vaccines would result in large pharmaceutical companies giving up valuable trade secrets and serve as a disincentive for companies to develop medicines and vaccines in response to other health crises.The share prices of vaccine manufacturers, including Pfizer and Moderna, fell in response to the US government’s support for the patent waiver.The Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association, a representative body for the pharmaceutical industry in Ireland, said that a waiver on the vaccines would not boost production capacity for the jabs but would instead set back “the medicines innovation agenda.”“It is a short-sighted and ineffectual decision that puts at risk the hard-won progress in fighting Covid-19,” said Oliver O’Connor, the chief executive of the IPHA.“We are urging the Government to oppose the waiver and to continue to back intellectual property as the formula for the invention of new vaccines, medicines and technologies.”Mr O’Connor said that a waiver would risk “erting raw materials and supplies away from well-established, effective supply chains to less efficient manufacturing sites where productivity and quality may be an issue” and “risks the entry of counterfeit vaccines” into global supplies.The industry has argued that it is pushing for an increase in vaccine production instead through licensing partnerships between vaccine creators and manufacturers.“Intellectual property is an important strategic area for the industry because it allows the industry to invest in research and commercialise products,” said Matt Moran, chief executive of BiopharmaChem, part of the business representative and lobby group, Ibec.“It underpins the research that led to the discovery of the vaccines that are being used and allowed companies to form partnerships on the basis that IP was going to be respected.”Mr Moran said that “any move to weaken” intellectual property would be a concern to the industry as it could disrupt supply chains and lead to low-quality products being made.The pharmaceutical industry is a key sector for the Government, employing about 25,000 people directly and about the same number who provide services to the industry.In 2019, the industry accounted for €140 billion in annual exports, or 32 per cent of the Irish gross domestic product, the value of goods and services produced in the State."},{"url":null,"title":"covid july set to see spectators in trial return to sports events easing of indoor dining rules","story":"A crowded Croke Park in July - 2019 -  GAA Hurling All-Ireland Senior Championship Semi-Final.

Fine Gael leader Leo Varadkar told his parliamentary party that indoor dining could return in July with six people to a table, contact details taken and allowances made for the size of venues. He said a decision would be taken next month. It comes as the Government prepares to discuss extensions and adjustments to key business and wage supports. The Cabinet subcommittee on economic recovery, chaired by the Tánaiste, will on Thursday meet to discuss the future of multibillion-euro subsidies due to expire this summer. The National Economic Recovery Plan will also be on the agenda. Additional supports for severely impacted business sectors will also be considered as part of the discussions, which are preliminary.No ‘cliff-edge’Sources emphasised that there would be no “cliff edge” to the schemes, and the intention is that they will stay in place to allow businesses to recover, especially those which are closed or restricted, and to allow employment to recover. However, senior sources also said the programmes could not stay in place indefinitely, especially as firms reopen fully under a hoped-for permanent easing of Covid restrictions.Discussions are expected to focus on plans for the second half of the year for supports such as the commercial rates waiver, the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP), the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) and the Covid Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS).However, any restructuring of the schemes would have to be weighed against uncertainty over the wider epidemiological situation, sources said. Elsewhere, the Government continues to consider a new plan to offer the AstraZeneca and Johnson \u0026ampJohnson vaccines to those under 50. Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly said advice on the use of the vaccines indicated they could be used in this way.

Round Hill, a multinational investment company, is in discussions to buy 115 homes at the development. Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillThe Attorney-General is being consulted by Government to ascertain if its proposal to prevent so-called cuckoo funds from buying up entire housing development in the suburbs will amount to a breach of Constitutional rights on property.Minister for Housing Darragh O’Brien and Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe are working on options to address the practice where large international investment funds have moved into the residential housing market.In the past week, it has been disclosed that one global property firm, Round Hill Capital, has acquired in a joint venture hundreds of homes in two new housing developments that would normally be targeted at first time buyers, and intends to put them on the private rental market at prices close to €2,000 per month.The company has bought close to 150 homes in the Mullen Park in Maynooth and 112 houses in Bay Meadows in Hollystown, Dublin 15. The company intends to rent out the houses as single family homes.Amid an escalating political crisis for the Government on this matter, Mr O’Brien and Mr Donohoe are expected to present a number of options to Government next week, which might provide solution.Mr O’Brien is said to be considering reintroducing a Bill he published while in Opposition in 2019, which was designed to prevent investment funds acquiring entire developments. It stipulated that 30 per cent of all units be reserved for first-time buyers.If the Bill were reintroduced in tandem with proposed changes to Part V of the Planning and Development Acts, (which provide for 10 per cent social housing and a further 10 per cent affordable housing on all new developments), it would mean that 50 per cent of all new housing developments would be reserved for social, affordable and first-purchase, houses.Labour’s spokeswoman on Housing Rebecca Moynihan said she would reintroduce Mr O’Brien’s 2019 Bill word-for-word if he failed to do so.The second option being examined is to ban such practices outside of city centre cores or areas of high density development. The Government is of the view that block buying apartments for private rental can have a role, especially for highly-paid employees of social media and technology companies. They tend to be younger, single and are not interested in purchasing property because of mobile lifestyles.Mr Donohoe is also looking at the tax laws to see if changes can be made to discourage such practices.However, a Government source said on Thursday that all of the options might impinge on constitutional rights in relation to property and the advice of A-G Paul Gallagher was being sought to ensure they did not breach such rights.The source also tempered expectation of an immediate solution saying it would take several weeks to arrive at a final decision.Outright BanOn Thursday Mr O’Brien said all measures would be considered to stop investment funds buying up full housing estates “up to and including” an outright ban.Mr O’Brien said he was committed to having proposals ready by next week with regard to legislating for investment funds.Speaking on Newstalk’ Pat Kenny show, Mr O’Brien said that the tax treatment of such investment funds was where the issue would be resolved in the long term.The Minister said he was considering all options, but that ultimately the Department of Finance would have to bring forward proposals to deal with the tax element.It was not acceptable to have investment funds come into the country to buy up family homes “from under the nose” of families, he added.Earlier Minister for Transport Eamon Ryan repeated the Government’s determination to stop the practice of investment funds bulk-buying new homes, and said the issue would be tackled through the planning process.Mr Ryan said Mr O’Brien was going to address the issue through the planning process, but different approaches would also be required as it was a complex issue. “I believe the best approach is planning,” he added.Mr Ryan said the Government is committed to not allowing the housing market be dominated by investment funds who were freezing couples out of the market, but added that investors were needed for projects such as large apartment buildings and the State needed to operate cost rental schemes.Mr Ryan said he did not believe the practice of bulk-buying houses in new estates was widespread, but the Government had to stop it before it became widespread. The housing market is not functioning as it is and other measures would be needed, he said.Mr Ryan said the move could require legislation which would take time. This is echoed by some sources involved in the discussions, who fear the process could be fraught with legal difficulties.Swoop inMinister for Higher Education Simon Harris has said it was “never, ever” intended that investment funds could “swoop in” to bulk buy homes and keep them from first time buyers.The Government was going to move “very swiftly” to ensure that what had happened in the housing estate in Maynooth could not happen again, there was “absolute clarity” across Government on the issue.Private investment funds did have a role to play in helping housing supply, but situations like Maynooth would not be tolerated he told RTÉ radio’s Today with Claire Byrne show. There would always be a role for private investors, to say otherwise was not the truth, he said.Actions would be taken to tighten the tax loopholess, he said. The Government wanted to level the playing field for first time buyers. The issue could not be personalised and proposals were from all of Government “not just Darragh O’Brien, Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael.”"},{"url":null,"title":"miriam lord government in a flap about the cuckoo in the property nest","story":"“How are ordinary house buyers who scrimp and save for a mortgage supposed to compete with this?” File photograph: iStock The Taoiseach was right to look concerned.A new strain has emerged.“There is something new in what happened over the weekend. There is no point in saying there isn’t because there is,” he informed Cian O’Callaghan of the Social Democrats.A new strain of the old greed.This could be called the “Maynooth variant” although a number of TDs say it isn’t new but an infection which has been slowly but steadily taking root under the eye of recent governments in a dangerously weakening market.“Insidious” is what Labour’s Duncan Smith called it.Micheál Martin identified this new strain during Leaders’ Questions. Like all the others it came from the liquid Reit market and is spread by cuckoos and vultures, but the big difference to look out for here is the emergence of bulk-buying of completed housing schemes.And swooping. Swooping in and scooping up.“Unacceptable,” he said. “Not acceptable.”Investment companies should not be purchasing entire suburban estates. His Government is absolutely opposed to this.The Taoiseach’s sincerity was genuine. As was his obvious concern, not just for the inidual victims of the Maynooth variant and other financial mutations, but for his administration’s future and his own political skin.He will be aware of the disgusted reaction to the Business Post’s weekend revelation of an investment vehicle called Round Hill Capital sneakily nipping in and snaffling all but 22 out of 174 new homes in a Kildare housing estate, shouldering shocked inidual buyers aside with its massive buying power.So he will be aware that this sort of practice has to be stopped, not only to help first-time buyers find a home but also to stem the public anger over the unfair, inequitable and dysfunctional state of the housing market here.Raging contagionAt least an effective vaccine exists now for coronavirus, while opposition criticism of the Coalition’s handling of the pandemic has always been tinged with the cautious awareness that a raging contagion is oblivious to the rule of politics.If only the same could be said for the housing crisis, which was very much with us before the pandemic and looks well set to outlast it. The climate allowing global real estate investment trusts (Reits) to flourish was engineered nearly 10 years ago by Fine Gael minister for finance Michael Noonan when he introduced tax breaks to encourage these companies to invest here and boost an economy emerging from deep recession.And in they poured.They weren’t supposed to go mad looking for money by milking the lovely tax breaks until too many suffered and too many noticed. They should have confined themselves to reaping lucrative returns from commercial property and nondescript apartment blocks full of students, young buckos and renters who can’t afford to buy their own place.They weren’t supposed to start muscling in on proper suburban houses built for people who want to raise a family and set down strong roots in the electoral register.But Darragh is all set to move on the Reits. Rarin’ to go. He just needs to take a good run at it first.Further analysisHe told Morning Ireland on Tuesday that further analysis would have to be done before he acts. Outright banning of these companies (was anyone suggesting that?) “would be a pretty radical move and might have unintended consequences”.It was pointed out more than once to his boss in the Dáil on Wednesday that Germany managed to do it, banning such wholesale investment in specific areas of housing as opposed to the entire property market.Cian O’Callaghan reminded the Taoiseach that the Construction Industry Federation said in 2009 that 95 per cent of new apartment builds in 2009 were bought by these funds. Was the Government only interested in protecting houses in the suburbs? What about apartments?This is when Micheál broke the news of the new variant – the purchasing of entire estates. New to him, that is.Social Democrat co-leader Catherine Murphy told him of other estates in Kildare which have been similarly bought over by these financial cuckoos who arrive with their fat chequebooks and special tax breaks and elbow out ordinary buyers from their chosen nest.“How are ordinary buyers who scrimp and save for a mortgage supposed to compete with this?”The Government has to do something. People who hoped to buy one of the new houses had no chance. The local council couldn’t match the swooping vultures either and the local housing trusts, also interested in acquiring some of the homes, were bankrolled out of buying by the cuckoos.“There’s a skewed ideology at play here,” she said, promising that “every one of us” would sit overnight or for the weekend if they had to pass legislation.The Taoiseach was very sympathetic. “In respect of that swoop-in by that investor, we are going to deal with that. That is not acceptable.”Factory shipsBut it gets worse. These Reits are like international factory ships, steaming into Ireland and indiscriminately hoovering up all sorts of housing stock.Duncan Smith revealed that first-time buyers are not just losing out on new homes. The investment funds are leaving young couples “absolutely devastated” by sniffing out second-hand homes that might be within the reach of first-time buyers and offering over the odds before they even hit the market.Sinn Féin, particularly its housing spokesman Eoin O’Broin, has been calling for a number of years for the tax loopholes which give these global financial machines a huge advantage over local buyers to be closed. Richard Boyd Barrett of People Before Profit has also long complained about the actions of the funds and brought the personal stories of powerless people’s lives turned upside down by them.Mary Lou McDonald was the first at Leaders’ Questions to demand action, and quickly, from the Government. She was followed by a succession of speakers from all Opposition parties.Even the venerable Bernard Durkan, Fine Gael stalwart, wanted to know what emergency legislation is planned. As a Kildare TD he is well aware of the housing heartbreak in the constituency.Outside the Dáil, Tánaiste Leo Varadkar limply said the situation is “undesirable”.Meanwhile, Darragh (let’s not be too radical) O’Brien said what is needed is “a whole-of-government approach”.The Taoiseach indicated that O’Brien, along with the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Public Expenditure, was working on a plan. But despite fevered demands from the Opposition to hear more, details there came none.In a novel twist, Labour Senator Rebecca Moynihan promised the party will introduce Darragh O’Brien’s 2019 Bill “word for word” if he doesn’t do it himself before the end of the week.Time for the Government to swoop and put this bad cuckoo back in its clock.Otherwise it will be the voters who are calling time."},{"url":null,"title":"how to improve weather predictions by reducing precision","story":"Atmospheric flow is chaotic: a small change in the starting values can lead to a wildly different forecast.Weather forecasting relies on supercomputers used to solve the mathematical equations that describe atmospheric flow. The accuracy of the forecasts is constrained by available computing power.Processor speeds have not increased much in recent years and speed-ups are achieved by running many processes in parallel. Energy costs have risen rapidly: there is a multimillion-euro annual power bill to run a supercomputer, which may consume something like 10 megawatts of power.Early computer programs for weather prediction, written in the Fortran language, stored numbers in single precision. Each number had 32 binary digits or bits corresponding to a decimal number with about seven significant digits. Later models moved to double precision, each number having 64 bits and about 15 accurate decimal digits. This is now common practice.It seems self-evident that higher numerical precision would result in greater forecast accuracy, but this is not necessarily the case. Observations, which provide starting data, have only a few digits precision. We may know the temperature to one-tenth of a degree or the wind speed within one metre per second. Representing these values with several digits beyond the decimal point may be futile. It could be likened to giving somebody’s height to the nearest millimetre or, in double precision, the nearest micron, which is meaningless.Computational resourcesOf course, higher precision does reduce errors during the millions of computations needed for a forecast. But higher precision also implies greater storage requirements, larger data transmission volumes and longer processing times. Are these costs justified or can limited computational resources be used in more efficient ways?At the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, researchers have been seeking ways to reduce computing power. They have found that 64-bit accuracy is not necessary and that, with 32-bit numbers, forecasts of the same quality are obtained much faster. The 40 per cent saving can be used in other ways, like enhancing spatial resolution or increasing ensemble size. Thus, a reduction in numerical precision can result in improved forecast accuracy.Chaotic flowAtmospheric flow is chaotic: this means that a small change in the starting values can lead to a wildly different forecast. Chaos was well-described by meteorologist Ed Lorenz, who asked if a tiny disturbance could cause a storm in a far-away continent. The idea is encapsulated in a Limerick:Lorenz demonstrated, with skill,The chaos of heatwave and chill:Tornadoes in TexasAre formed by the flexesOf butterflies’ wings in BrazilTo allow for chaos, meteorologists run their models multiple times with slightly different starting values. The spread of these “ensembles” gives a measure of the confidence that can be placed in a forecast, and probabilities of different scenarios can be given. Researchers at the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts were surprised that reducing numerical precision of the computations had little influence on the quality of the ensemble forecasts.For climate simulations, which run over decades or centuries, it is expected that, by using reduced number lengths, substantial savings will be possible. Some sensitive operations like matrix inversion may require double precision but the bulk of the calculations can be done with 32 bits. Current work is also testing half-precision (16-bit numbers) for non-sensitive components of the models.Peter Lynch is emeritus professor at UCD school of mathematics and statistics, University College Dublin.

Photograph:  John ThysAFP via Getty ImagesOn Christmas Eve last year, as the Brexit negotiations were entering their final minutes, Michel Barnier sought out his British counterpart in a room in the European Commission’s Berlaymont headquarters.“After nine months of negotiations, it is the last time I would see David Frost and our final exchange is professional and cold,” Barnier, who was chief Brexit negotiator, writes in The Great Illusion: a secret Brexit diary (2016-2020)“He knows I know that until the last moment he has been trying to circumvent me by opening a parallel negotiating track with Ursula von der Leyen’s cabinet. And he knows it has not been successful.”Although he describes Frost as courteous, Barnier makes clear that he neither trusted the British negotiator nor admired his negotiating style. A few weeks earlier, when the British team were refusing to engage with issues of concern to the European side, Barnier told them their negotiating technique was a farce.Throughout his 500-page diary, which is published in French on Thursday and will appear in an English translation in October, Barnier is bewildered by the British approach to the talks. He never wavers from his conviction that Britain made a mistake in leaving the European Union but he is surprised again and again by the incompetence and self-delusion that informed London’s negotiating strategy.When Theresa May declared in Lancaster House that Britain wanted to leave the single market and the customs union but hoped to maintain many of their benefits, he could scarcely believe what he was hearing.“Have the consequences of these decisions been thought through, measured, discussed? Does she realise this rules out almost all forms of cooperation we have with our partners?” he writes.“I am amazed at the way the prime minister has shown her hand.”He is generous towards May, describing her as a courageous woman surrounded by a lot of men putting their personal interests ahead of those of their country. Boris Johnson was one of those men but Barnier is careful not to underestimate him and finds him to be an appealing, if “baroque”, personality.He enjoyed a warm relationship with David Davis but has little complimentary to say about the next Brexit secretary, Dominic Raab, whom he describes as having a messianic glint in his eye.When Raab demanded that the Irish Border issue should be resolved as part of an overall agreement, he warned that the EU would otherwise be responsible for the impact of a no-deal Brexit in the North.‘The fault of the UK’“We are searching for solutions together. And Dominic, if this threat is the new line of your government, then the negotiations can end immediately. And I will prepare myself in the coming days to inform the European Parliament and member states. We will regard the failure as being the fault of the UK,” Barnier told him.From the start, the issue of the Border was central to the talks and Barnier is at his most passionate when he describes his personal commitment to the peace process and his feelings when he met people in Northern Ireland.“I promised myself in this negotiation not to fuel the polemics and attacks from the British tabloids, to pay attention to the words I use, to stick to the facts, the figures, the legal fundamentals, in short, to leave little room for emotion and feelings, for the sake of objectivity. But here in Ireland . . . it is difficult not tobe touched by the sensitivity, the emotion of those who express themselves, the memories that remind me of this tragedy,” he writes.Barnier describes former Taoiseach Leo Varadkar as “courageous”, praising his role in the abortion rights referendum. Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney is “always shrewd, methodical and well-informed” and Barnier singles out John Callinan from the Taoiseach’s office and Ireland’s former EU ambassador Declan Kelleher for praise.While May was hamstrung by the need to negotiate every step in the Brexit talks with her own party, Barnier maintained unity among the EU’s member-states by frequent visits to capitals and open channels of communication to the leaders.Johnson’s indifference to the truth and his pursuit of “dead cat” strategies and staged crises complicated the negotiations and when Frost opened the second phase of negotiations he told Barnier that the prime minister did not feel bound by the political declaration he agreed alongside the withdrawal agreement.The Internal Market Act, which included clauses that would have allowed the British government to unilaterally suspend the Northern Ireland protocol, was the trigger for Barnier’s final loss of trust in his negotiating partners. He suggests that Johnson waited until Donald Trump’s election defeat before withdrawing the offending clauses, fearful of their impact on his relationship with Joe Biden.La Grande Illusion – Journal secret du Brexit (2016-2020) is published by Gallimard.

People who earlier in the year were studiously following the rules are now breaking them in all kinds of little ways. The public has decided that the Covid emergency is over – at least for now – and are regaining their lives by stealth.By refusing to open up sooner, the government is losing its control of the population. But then was it ever really in control anyway? No doubt Matt Hancock, along with some of the Cabinet’s other native authoritarians, takes personal credit for tackling the Covid crisis by forcing people to socially-distance. Yet evidence points elsewhere: to the public leading the government in efforts to combat the pandemic, not the other way around. Some government advisers have taken to claiming that thousands of lives could have been saved had lockdown been imposed a week earlier than 23 March last year, the day a solemn Boris Johnson told us all to stay at home. But it is a pretty irrelevant argument given that the public had already largely placed itself in self-imposed lockdown.By the following Monday, when the government’s tone changed after the publication of the famous Imperial paper predicting up to 500,000 deaths form Covid, tube usage had already plunged to 60 per cent. By that Friday it had fallen to just 24 per cent as employers and employees between them made voluntary arrangements to work at home, and by the following Monday, ahead of Johnson’s evening address to the nation, it had plummeted to only 15 per cent. By the time lockdown was imposed, in other words, there wasn’t much left to lock down.Just as the public led the government into lockdown, so it is leading the government out of lockdown. Last weekend, car traffic was back up to 96 per cent of pre-pandemic levels – in spite of messages which still flicker, pointlessly, from motorway gantries telling us to “minimise travel”. Light commercial traffic is 14 per cent higher than it was before the pandemic.Those of us who have stood against endless lockdowns, and the petty laws and eyewatering fines used to try to enforce them, have been accused in some quarters of irresponsibility. Yet all we have been doing is appealing for the government to trust our own sense of responsibility rather than try to steamroller us into compliance. With some exceptions, people have shown themselves perfectly able to make their own, reasoned assessment of the risks posed by Covid, and of acting accordingly.The government’s input has been to tie up that process in regulatory knots, ending with bizarre legal debates as to whether a Scotch egg counts as a substantial meal and so on.There are serious dangers from trying to command the public into how to behave. As well as creating the bad feeling which surrounds any illiberal regime, living under endless orders blunts our sense of personal responsibility. Just look how some people rushed out to the pub in the few days before the second lockdown came into effect in November. The last chance to do something legally had encouraged them to take risks they wouldn’t have taken had they been left to themselves to decide what was and what wasn’t safe.There is little purpose to the remaining restrictions on our day to day lives. People can see that the vaccination programme has been a brilliant success and that their risk of coming to serious harm from Covid is now no higher than of succumbing to other diseases. They no longer see why their lives should be put on hold. It is about time the government caught up.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"austrian prince investigation poaching one biggest bears romania","story":"Romanian police are investigating a Liechtenstein prince for poaching after he killed a huge male bear described as the biggest male living deep in the wild on a hunting trip to the Carpathian mountains. Prince Emanuel von und zu Liechtenstein, who lives in Austria, was granted a four-day hunting permit in March in Romania\u0027s Covasna County, official hunting documents revealed. The papers said the aristocrat “harvested” a 17 year-old brown bear called Arthur on the hunt. He paid just over £6,000 for the trophy but reports alleged the animal was “wrongly” killed.Due to Arthur the brown bear\u0027s large size, it was considered in hunting parlance a Golden trophy, prized specimens which can fetch more than £17,000.Repeated attempts to contact the prince\u0027s estate were unsuccessful. Switzerland\u0027s Blick newspaper quoted the prince as saying he wouldn\u0027t comment on the matter.Romania, which is home to Europe\u0027s biggest population of brown bears, banned trophy hunting in 2016, except in the cases of certain problem animals that damage crops or animals. Environmental groups who have monitored Arthur for the past nine years insist it lived deep in the wild and had no contact with humans. Agent Green, a NGO, said the hunting permit was issued for a  cub-rearing female bear that had caused damage in the village of Ojdula in Transylvania last summer.It was always about shooting the biggest bear and not about solving the problem of the community, Gabriel Paun, president of Agent Green, told the Associated Press. I wonder how the prince mistook the biggest male living deep in the wild against the much smaller female next to the village.Every farmer I spoke to in the village of Ojdula said that nothing had changed since the male bear was shot and that the female bear continues to come daily to the households.

Indeed, it has even been suggested that his violent conduct prompted more moderate figures in the IRA leadership to reveal his whereabouts in Belfast, resulting in his killing by British soldiers in April 1972.It is a supreme irony, therefore, that one of the IRA’s more renowned killers should now, nearly 50 years after he met his violent end, be feted as a cause celebre by the republicans, someone who, instead of being remembered for the catalogue of violence he wrought, is lauded as an innocent victim of British brutality.The fact that McCann is viewed in such terms is the by-product of both the republican movement’s success in being able to see dubious cases relating to the Troubles brought to court, and the failure of successive British governments to prevent them from doing so.There have been numerous pledges in Queen’s Speeches dating back a decade or more in which ministers have pledged to address the anomaly by which veterans who risked their lives in the service of their country during the Troubles find themselves liable to prosecution, while IRA terrorists responsible for some of the worst atrocities of the era have been granted immunity.The fundamental reason for this iniquitous state of affairs dates back to the Good Friday Agreement in 1998, when Tony Blair, in his desperation to win republican support for the deal, in effect granted an amnesty to IRA terrorists, irrespective of the crimes they had committed. Mr Blair has subsequently argued that, without this concession, the deal would never have been struck.But it resulted in an estimated 200 “on-the-run” terrorists being sent letters providing assurances that they were no longer wanted by the police for their crimes. Among them was John Downey, who was accused of carrying out the 1982 Hyde Park bombing, which killed 11 soldiers.While legions of IRA terrorists have been granted immunity from prosecution, it is a disgrace that no provision has been made to give similar protection to British service personnel who served during the Troubles, even though prime ministers from David Cameron through to Boris Johnson have promised to do so.There is an expectation that a pledge to provide better protection to veterans will be contained in next week’s Queen’s Speech outlining the Government’s goals. The concern, though, is that, as with previous promises, no effective action will ultimately be forthcoming.The simple reason for the Government’s reluctance to act is that, by affording veterans the same immunity from prosecution as IRA terrorists, Downing Street risks alienating Sinn Fein, the current standard-bearers of the republican cause whose support is deemed essential to maintaining the peace in Northern Ireland.Consequently, while the British authorities are prevented from prosecuting those responsible for some of the worst atrocities during the Troubles, Sinn Fein and their allies in Northern Ireland can persist with their persecution of British veterans even when, as this week’s collapse of the trial of the two paratroopers accused of murdering McCann has graphically demonstrated, the evidence is deeply flawed.Even though legal experts had given explicit warnings that there were serious flaws in the prosecution case several years ago, Barra McGrory, Northern Ireland’s then director of public prosecutions, insisted on proceeding.Mr McGrory has previously represented Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams and his colleague Martin McGuinness, who are both alleged to have enjoyed close ties with the IRA. This has led to accusations that the trial of the two paratroopers was politically motivated, rather than an exercise in seeking justice.Certainly, with prosecutors in Northern Ireland said to be looking at pressing charges in another 200 cases involving veterans of the Troubles, there is an urgent need for the Government to take action to prevent further gross miscarriages of justice, instead of constantly pandering to the whims of Sinn Fein and its IRA supporters.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"scottish independence polls tracker 2021 referendum latest election","story":"Opinion polls conducted since the start of April show dwindling support for Scottish independence,  analysis shows. Over the past month, an average of the polls show that 46 per cent of Scots are against independence whilst 45 per cent are in favour. The most recent ten polls conducted widen that gap to 47 per cent opposed and 44 per cent in favour. The proportion of undecided voters has remained steady at around 9 per cent of the population.The results come as a significant change in people\u0027s views on independence. Since early-2020, support for Scottish independence had overtaken opposition, with the Yes vote securing a 8 per lead in average polling numbers in October last year. This resurgence in Scottish nationalism came as the devolved government took a markedly different approach to its handling of the Covid-19 pandemic from Westminster and Brexit. But in recent months, the success of the UK-government\u0027s vaccination rollout and splits within the Scottish nationalist movement appear to have dampened support for independence. Before the resurgence last year, polls has shown clear opposition to independence, even after the EU referendum which saw England and Wales vote in favour of Brexit, whilst Northern Ireland and Scotland voted to remain. In 2014 Scotland voted by a clear majority to stay in the UK, with 55.3 per cent of ballots cast against independence leaving and 44.7 per cent cast in favour, but the most recent polling average now shows the situation reversed. Despite the decline in support for Scottish independence, the Scottish National Party has sustained a considerable gap in the polls ahead of Thursday\u0027s Scottish Parliament elections. An average of the most recent polls show 48.5 per cent of Scots plan to vote for the SNP in their constituencies.This is ahead of the Conservative\u0027s 21.5 per cent, Labour\u0027s 20.3 per cent and the Liberal Democrat\u0027s 7.5 per cent . But similar to independence, the support for the SNP has decreased in the polls in recent months. Read more: \u0027Nicola Sturgeon to plan for Scottish independence on day one if elected\u0027In October last year, their polling numbers averaged at around 54 per cent. Labour have benefited most from this slump in the polls, having increased their polling numbers by 5 per cent over the period. Scottish voters will also vote for regional members of the Scottish Parliament with polls similarly showing a significant gap between the SNP and the second-place Conservatives. During the last election in 2016, the SNP fells two seats short of an overall majority in the Scottish Parliament. The fall in the polls could hamper hopes of claiming a majority in the elections which would have been used as justification for seeking a second referendum vote. In January, the SNP proposed an 11-point roadmap for holding a second referendum if they secure a majority in the Parliament. Since then, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has been engaged in a bitter conflict with former SNP leader Alex Salmond over sexual harassment claims against the latter. Ms Sturgeon was cleared of breaking rules over her handling of the allegations but was heavily criticised by some members of the Scottish Parliament. In the aftermath, Mr Salmond went on to form his own independence party, Alba, which is also contesting in today\u0027s Scottish election.   More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"sending ships france might stunt good one","story":"To most of us, there is nothing wrong whatsoever with a PM standing up for Britain.

tweeted founder Elon Musk triumphantly, after the last four tries ended in big explosions.Nominal means normal in the context of spaceflight.The execution wasn\u0027t quite perfect, with a small fire engulfing the base of the 50 meter- (160 feet-) high rocket, dubbed SN15, shortly after landing.SpaceX webcaster John Insprucker explained this was not unusual with the methane fuel we\u0027re using, adding engineers were still working out design issues.The flames were quickly put out with water cannons, footage showed.Earlier, the rocket took off at around 5:25 pm local time (2225 GMT) from the Starbase in Boca Chica in southern Texas, reached an altitude of 10 kilometers (6 miles) and performed a series of maneuvers, including a horizontal descent called a belly flop.SpaceX was facing added pressure to succeed with Wednesday\u0027s flight after NASA last month announced a version of Starship will be used as a lunar lander when the space agency returns humans to the Moon.But the $2.9 billion contract is currently suspended after two rival companies, Jeff Bezos\u0027 Blue Origin and Dynetics, lodged a protest.Nevertheless, if the award is eventually confirmed, it will transform Starship from Musk\u0027s pet project to a major tax payer-funded venture, with all the scrutiny that entails.The first two flight tests of Starship, SN8 and SN9, both crash landed and exploded when they launched in December and February, respectively.The next, SN10, successfully landed then blew up a few minutes later on March 3.The video feed cut out during the test flight of the fourth, SN11, with Musk later confirming it too had exploded, this time in mid-flight.Eventually, SpaceX plans to combine the Starship spaceship with a Super Heavy rocket, creating a fully reusable system to explore deep into our solar system.This final version will stand 394 feet (120 meters) tall and will be able to carry 100 metric tonnes into Earth orbit - the most powerful launch vehicle ever developed.Musk wants to use this to help realize his goal of transforming humanity into a multiplanetary species with a colony on Mars.The planned lunar version of Starship would however serve a more modest goal - docking with a future lunar orbital station, collecting astronauts, then setting them down on the Moon.To get the astronauts to the lunar station in the first place, NASA has a more traditional plan in mind: using its own giant SLS rocket with a crew capsule called Orion affixed on top.But the SLS rocket has suffered severe delays and cost overruns, and observers have mused if Starship succeeds, it could one day make SLS obsolete.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"waiving covid vaccine patents may noble really best solution","story":"Leading health experts have conflicting views on whether it is the right move to strip pharmaceutical companies of the intellectual property rights on Covid-19 vaccines.While the World Health Organisation (WHO) welcomed the decision by the US on Wednesday to waive its IP rights - calling it a “watershed moment” - some scientists warn the move could backfire.Dr Anthony Fauci, President Joe Biden’s chief medical adviser, has pushed back against the global calls, warning it may not be the best way to actually improve vaccine access.In an interview this week Dr Fauci, the head of the US’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said he was “agnostic” about the idea of waiving rights as it may not be “the fastest and most efficient way” of getting shots in arms.“If you take too long, people are going to die,” he told the Financial Times. “There are other ways to ramp up vaccine production around the world.With Covax, the WHO-led vaccine-sharing programme, struggling to gain momentum because of vaccine shortages, pleas have been growing to do something about what rights groups term “vaccine apartheid”. Wealthy countries have secured more than half of nearly nine billion doses locked up in purchase agreements to date. Developing countries that are most in need, such as virus-beleaguered India, meanwhile, have struggled to get their share.The waiver, which would affect firms like Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca and Johnson \u0026amp Johnson, would give other companies across the world access to the information needed to make their own vaccines and remove legal barriers stopping them from doing so.Advocates say this would enable more manufacturers across the globe to produce vaccines and help combat dwindling supply. “Surely in this once in a hundred years moment of crisis, we can find it within us to forget about profits and think about humanity,” Dr Ayoade Alakija, co-chair of the Africa Union Vaccine Delivery Alliance. “The argument has to be for these big pharma to release the formula so we can save lives across the world.” But while Dr Fauci said he supports efforts to boost vaccine supply, he warned that a waiver could potentially end in a protracted legal battle as it needs to be agreed by the World Trade Organisation.“Going back and forth, consuming time and lawyers in a legal argument about waivers - that is not the end game,” he said. “People are dying around the world and we have to get vaccines into their arms in the fastest and most efficient way possible.”While Biden\u0027s backing adds political impetus to get a deal done, other countries with big pharmaceuticals sectors, including Britain, Japan, Switzerland and in the European Union, are opposed to the waiver and have the ability to block the proposal.What this decision will do, if it goes forward, is benefit countries like China that are aggressively trying to obtain US technology to bolster their own domestic champions, Republican Senator Mike Crapo said in a statement.Pharmaceutical companies also strongly oppose any efforts to do away with intellectual property rights. Companies argue that without the money patents bring in there is little incentive for them to undertake the expensive task of developing and bringing drugs to market. “This decision will remove the incentives and rewards for the innovators on who our very lives depend,” Amesh Adalja, an infectious diseases expert and senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, said on Wednesday. “If rights can be \u0027waived\u0027 away, they aren’t really rights. This is the wrong decision.”Big companies also argue that they are already operating at full capacity and that they have already taught manufacturers in other countries how to make their vaccines. While this so-called “tech transfer” has worked well during the pandemic so far, it uses up considerable resources.Industry experts say companies may not be able to produce the drugs quickly even without patent protections, pointing to supply chain issues and the wider technological know-how that is not included with patents.Thomas Cueni, the head of the pharmaceutical lobby group IFPMA, said at a panel recently that making vaccines isn’t like following a Mary Berry recipe. It is a far more complex process - and even if you do follow it recipe it does not always go to plan. Following the US announcement the IFPMA aded that the waiver is a distraction from the real challenges in scaling up production and distribution of vaccines globally: namely elimination of trade barriers, addressing bottlenecks in supply chains and scarcity of raw materials and ingredients in the supply chain, and a willingness by rich countries to start sharing doses with poor countries.Meanwhile, countries like India, which is now battling the world’s worst outbreak of Covid and has only fully vaccinated two per cent of its 1.4 billion population, need help now. Even campaigners for the waiver admit that it will not mean vaccines will be available overnight. Dr Fauci suggested that companies in the West should instead be encouraged to increase production and export excess doses, and countries should also donate any surplus, as some, such as Norway and Sweden, have begun to do. Pfizer has shipped some 10 million doses to Mexico, while the White House has promised to export 60 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine.Many suggested that regardless of the effectiveness, such a decision would send a powerful message from richer countries and pharmaceutical firms that they are willing to forgo some profit for the greater good.“Arguably the strongest argument for a temporary waiver is that patents were never designed for use during global emergencies such as wars or pandemics,” wrote Nature magazine in a recent editorial.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"3 10 older black brits","story":"News in  older black Brits not vaccinated as government urged to boost take-upThe ONS warned many factors could be at play in the lower take-up, including that more deprived groups may be less able to travel to a vaccination centremirrorShareCommentsByIan JonesJemma Crew:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY News\" content\"https:i-prod.mirror incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _BRITAIN-HEALTH-VIRUS-VACCINE.jpg\"A queue to receive the vaccine in Colchester\" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

The Office for National Statistics today said black Caribbean and black African people are the least likely over-s to have got a jab, at .% and .% respectively. They were followed by people from Pakistani backgrounds, .% of whom were vaccinated at age  or over. This compares with .% of white British adults, with estimates for all ethnic minority groups lower than this. Vaccination rates were estimated to be lower in people of Muslim or Buddhist faiths, those who do not speak English, those living in more deprived areas and disabled people.Caroline Lucas, vice-chairwoman of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on coronavirus, said community engagement has shown it is possible to overcome deep-seated mistrust but it must be done at the grassroots level rather than imposed by Whitehall. She added: The pandemic has already exposed deep inequalities in our society. Dividing people into the vaccinated and unvaccinated through schemes like vaccine passports risks making this worse and alienating the communities where vaccine take-up is already low, particularlythey are used to restrict access to everyday services. That must not be allowed to happen. Dr Ben Kasstan, a medical anthropologist at the University of Bristol, said the data raised urgent questions about the delivery of the vaccination programme in ethnic and religious minority communities and lessons learned. He said: Putting issues in accessibility aside, policymakers need to look at how long-running issues of trust and social exclusion may be being directed towards the coronavirus vaccine programme, and thinking intersectionally across race, religion, and socioeconomic status will be essential as we move forward. The ONS said lower take-up could reflect access problems.  Hugh Stickland, head of strategy and engagement at the ONS, said the lower rates are broadly similar to the groups who express vaccine hesitancy, adding: However, the reasons for lower uptake are likely to be complex, including for example being unable to travel to a vaccination centre. It is the second time the ONS has published analysis on vaccination rates in older people broken down by age, sex, ethnicity, religious affiliation, disability and deprivation. It analysed data from the National Immunisation Management Serviceon people over  between December  and April , linking it to peopleaposs NHS numbers. Dferences in geography, socio-demographic factors and underlying health conditions do not fully explain the lower vaccination rates among ethnic minority groups, the ONS found. Statistical modelling showed the odds of not having received a dose of a vaccine were . times greater for people from black Caribbean backgrounds compared with people of white British ethnicity. After adjusting for age, sex, socio-demographic characteristics and underlying health conditions, the odds were still . times greater. For people identying as black African, the unadjusted odds were six times greater, while the adjusted odds were . times higher. The ONS also found a relationship between proficiency in English language, as recorded in the  census, and vaccination rates.

Polls leave little doubt the SNP will be the largest party but Opinium say an overall majority is too close to call. If the nationalists up their seat tally from  to , they will push for a new independence referendum - seven years after last losing their fight.

First Minister Mark Drakeford has ruled out an independence referendum as the price of any pact, but could need a deal with Plaid Cymru or the Lib Demshe’s to form a minority government. This is one of UKIP’s last outposts, where ex-Tory Neil Hamilton clings on for Nigel Farage’s old party even after he abandoned it. WHERE  Everywhere in Wales. ENGLISH MAYORS: Londonaposs mayoral election is the biggest but Labour’s Sadiq Khan is on course for an easy victory. The biggest battles are over Tory-held Tees Valley and West Midlands. Labour wants a Red Wall upset to seize West Midlands but hopes appear slim in Tees Valley. Voters are also electing two other metro mayors in Labour-held Greater Manchester and Liverpool City Region. There are three combined authority mayoral elections - Tory-held West of England and Cambridgeshire  Peterborough, along with new mayoralty West Yorkshire., where Labour MP an ex-soap star Tracy Brabin wants a win.

This is because there are more elections than usualand counting is much slower .Friday  May: From amResults start trickling in from the  overnight councils in England.They include Derby which has swung from Labour to Tory-run no overall controlin recent years. And Southend has been run by a Labour, Lib Dem and Green ‘rainbow coalition’ since the Tory leader was voted out in .

And the Tories seized Redditch from Labour in , so on a good night Keir Starmer’s party would want to make in-roads there. Labour strongholds Gateshead , Newcastle, Knowsley, Sunderland, Oldham, South Tyneside and Rochdale all declare early. Friday  May: From am The Hartlepool by-election result is due around am. If the Tories overturn Labour’s , majority and claim the Westminster seat for the first time in its history, it will likely lead the day’s news and be a big political headache for Keir Starmer. We should get our first mayor result in the Doncaster mayoral election, currently held by Labour. And we could get some of the most interesting of the overnight council results, including Dudley where Labour and the Tories are almost neck-and-neck. Also declaring at sunrise are Stockport , a Labour-Lib Dem split in NOC, and Nuneaton  Bedworth which could go red, blue or NOC. On a good night the Tories will want to seize control of Northumberland where they rule in a minority. Friday  May: From amIf you’ve stayed up overnight, go to bed. No more results are likely during the morning. But from am, counting begins for an avalanche of races - all  seats for the Welsh Parliament, half the London Assembly,  of the  constituencies for the Scottish Parliament, and  councils in England.

Friday  May: From Noon Lunchtime council results start rolling in, including Burnley where Labour only needs one more seat to take control. Tories only need small gains to take control of Bolton but it won’t be an easy fight.

Meanwhile we’ll get the mayor of Liverpool, a Labour stronghold but home to a furious row over the party’s selection of their candidate.Many of the most important Scottish Parliament results will roll in at some point on Friday afternoon.They include Dumbarton where Labour’s deputy leader Jackie Baillie clung on by whisker against the SNP in . Labour are likewise fighting hard to defend Edinburgh Southern and East Lothian against an SNP challenge. Despite speculation of a three-way fight, they believe either the SNP or Tories will take Edinburgh Central .Eastwood was a three-way fight in , won by the Scottish Tories. The big name race is in Glasgow Southside where new leader Anas Sarwar is challenging First Minister Nicola Sturgeon. He’ll lose, but get in on the regional list system instead and Labour are hoping to dent the SNP majority.Friday  May: From pmWe’re due the first results from Wales, including the Parliament’s most marginal seat Llanelli where Plaid Cymru are challenging Labour. Welsh Labour will also be fighting off the Tories in Wrexham , a key brick in a so-called red wall.Elsewhere, we’ll start getting the first seven results for the London Assembly and the first police commissioners in Avon and Somerset and Staffordshire. And an avalanche of English council results begins as the afternoon wears on. Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire turned blue recently and a strong Labour performance should at least kick them into NOC. Ex-minister Edwina Currie - yes her! - is standing against Labour ex-MP Ruth George to become a Derbyshire councillor. Seizing back Trafford from the Tories was Labour’s big victory in  so the party must hold on now to avoid a reverse humiliation.Cornwall is run by a Lib Dem-Independent coalition but the Tories have the most seats and will be hoping to gain. Ex-UKIP territory Basildon will be a hard Labour-Tory fight but could stay in NOC. On a bad night for Labour the party could lose Bury , Sheffield or West Lancashire to NOC, while Tories could gain Maidstone in a tussle with Lib Dems. Tories have no seats in Sheffield or Sandwell - will they up their count to one Friday  May: From pm The Tees Valley metro mayor result is due, with Tory Ben Houchen tipped to hang on against his Labour challenger in the former ‘red wall’. And in Wales we’ll get the Labour marginals of Caerphilly and Vale of Clwyd where Plaid and Tories respectively are putting up a fight. Lib Dems are also defending their only seat in Brecon and Radnorshire - and will Rhondda stay Plaid in the Valleys Over in England, about  councils are due to declare in the space of just  minutes.The biggest races include Norfolk , Cambridgeshire , Essex, counties up for all-out election that are Tory-run but could give Labour inroads.Cambridge also has all its seats up for election in a battle between Labour and the Lib Dems. On good nights for the main parties, Labour could win Wirral and Crawley or the Tories could win Pendle and Elmbridge from NOC. Labour’s first county, Durham , should stay red - as should Doncaster but the Tories might look for small in-roads asall its seats are up. Labour only need to lose a few seats in Plymouth to lose to NOC but the Tories wouldn’t be able to form a majority. Likewise Tory-run Walsall could fall to NOC on a bad night for Boris Johnson.Solihull is unusual - it’s Tory-run but with a Green opposition and the Conservatives will lose controlthey’re docked one seat.Friday  May: From pmMore than a dozen final results flood in for the Welsh Parliament, making clear whether Labour will need to form a coalition.Key declarations include Tory target Vale of Glamorgan and First Minister Mark Drakeford’s seat Cardf West. Likewise by the end of the night we’ll have results for  of the  Scottish Parliament seats, giving some early indication of whether Nicola Sturgeon’s on course for an outright majority.About a dozen more English council results should come in during the evening including Hull, where Labour want to keep Lib Dems at bay.Mole Valley has slim Lib Dem control with a Tory and Independent challenge while Worcester could go Tory or Labour.No results are expected overnight on Friday unless a particular council chooses to push things late into the night.Saturday  May: From amNormally elections would be over by Saturday - but counting will resume in earnest this year. But go out for brunch or something - the results shouldn’t roll in until noon or so. There will be all remaining constituency seats and all regional seats in Scotland,  councils in England, the rest of the London Assembly and at least  police commissioners. Counts will also begin in the mayoral elections for London, Bristol, Greater Manchester, Liverpool City Region, North Tyneside, Salford, the West of England and the West Midlands.Saturday  May: From Noon The first results from the  English councils counting on Saturday, including Lancashire which the Tories took from NOC in . Aside from this there may be few surprises in England until later in the afternoon. Oxford and North Tyneside are both Labour while Shropshire, Worcester, Broxbourne and Hertfordshire are all Tory . Eastleigh is solidly Lib Dem. We could get the Liverpool City mayor and the North Tyneside mayor , both likely Labour, and the West of England mayor , which the Tories won by a slim margin in . In Scotland we should get results in Aberdeenshire West, which the Tories took from the SNP by a slim margin in , and key target seat Perthshire South which the Tories want to take from the SNP this time. Saturday  May: From pm The key result for the West Midlands mayor - which Labour ex-minister Liam Byrne wants to seize from Tory incumbent Andy Street. If he can pull it off it’d be a key symbolic victory for Keir Starmer in territory where the Tories gained much ground under Corbyn.We should get results from mid-afternoon for the rest of the London Assembly constituencies, but the mayor will only be later in the evening.We should however get confirmation ‘king of the north’ Andy Burnham has been re-elected as Greater Manchester mayor . And results for  police and crime commissioners are likely. The results for the Salford mayor are also due. About  more English council results should flood in mid to late afternoon including Hartlepool, where the Tories are part of a complex coalition and turnout should be high due to the by-election. Labour need just three seats to take control of Kirklees but the Tories have previously gained ground in the area. Meanwhile the Lib Dems would only need a few seats to seize Gosport from the Conservatives.Milton Keynes is a three-way fight between Labour and the Lib Dems, currently in coalition under NOC, and the Tories. The Lib Dems and Tories will both be vying to retake NOC Portsmouth while the Lib Dems and Labour will want to regain seats they lost in Tory Wiltshire. Stroud is interesting - NOC with a rainbow coalition of Labour, Greens and Lib Dems but Tories are the largest party. And Rotherham doesn’t have a single Tory, will it stay that way "},{"url":null,"title":"local elections 2021 live polls","story":"\"liveBlogUpdate\": ,\"publisher\":,\"image\":,\"mainEntityOfPage\":\"https:www.mirror news politics local-elections--live-polls-\",Click here for the full story\",\"author\":,\"publisher\":,\"image\":,\"mainEntityOfPage\":\"https:www.mirror news politics local-elections--live-polls-\",],\"publisher\":,\"image\":,\"mainEntityOfPage\":\"https:www.mirror news politics local-elections--live-polls-\",Twitter just after .am as polls prepared to open across England, Wales and Scotland.

Scientists say the male sex hormones called androgens - that cause hair loss - make them more susceptible. It could explain the gender gap in deaths, with men twice as likely to succumb to the disease and the discovery could revolutionise treatment of patients and slash mortality rates.Men carrying mutations sensitive to androgens - which include testosterone - were found to be prone to worse coronavirus symptoms, researchers say.Scientists have also found similar results in women who are losing their hair due to androgens. A US team noticed  per cent of hospitalised patients had androgenetic alopecia - commonly known as male pattern baldness. This was dramatically disproportionate to the  to  percent in a similar age-matched population. The condition is caused by iants in a gene called AR, which regulates a protein known as TMPRSS - that is implicated in coronavirus. A study of  men hospitalised with the infection showed those with low CAG levels were at less risk of being admitted to the intensive care unit. Researchers say this could be a game-changer in combatting the pandemic. Lead author Dr Andy Goren, chief medical officer at Applied Biology, Inc, Irvine, Calornia, said: Our data show longer AR CAG scores are associated with more severe COVID- disease. The identication of a biomarker connected with the androgen receptor is another piece of evidence highlighting the important role of androgens in COVID- disease severity. The researchers also identied a promising therapy using a novel drug that blocks the androgen receptor.

The Immigration Services Union , which represents Britainaposs border immigration and customs staff, is urging Downing Street to make drastic changes for when the ban on non-essential travel is lted. The union said delays of up to seven hours were seen when borders opened last summer, and fears they will be even worse this time and last for months. Stringent checks include all arrivals being spoken to by immigration officers to ensure they havenapost arrived through a red list country before they are allowed to pass through the e-gates.

So, people from all over the world will be mixing inside for a long time. While British Airline Pilots AssociationGeneral Secretary Brian Strutton told MailOnline : Sorting border queues is absolutely in the Governmentaposs control, and they must do it now.As I explained at the recent Transport Select Committee hearing, the prospect of hours upon hours of queuing at airports is just another barrier that will put the public off travelling.

Simon McNamara, from the International Air Transport Association, told the i he is not optimistic the Government has a working plan for when borders open later this month.

We will all be affected by grief at some point – something that has proved all too true for many people as a result of the pandemic. There is of course no “right” or “normal” way to grieve – everyone will experience their own emotional journey following a bereavement. We shouldn’t be putting pressure on ourselves to experience a certain sensation – like anger or acceptance – at a certain time, says Andy Langford, clinical director at Cruse Bereavement Care. Instead, we should be giving ourselves time and space.But it can be particularly hard when you live alone. The following advice from Co-op Funeralcare might help:Keep talking One thing that can give comfort is talking about your feelings with friends or family, so it’s important not to become isolated. Stay connected Use video and phone calls and social media to stay in touch. Arrange times to chat with people – having this in your diary can add something to look forward to and purpose to your day.  Stick to a routine As much as possible, try to get up at the same time each day, and prepare and eat meals when you normally would. If you can, get outside to exercise. Don’t be too ambitious Set yourself manageable tasks. Sometimes that will simply be getting out for a walk.

A Jersey resident claims his boat was deliberately rammed by a French trawler in the harbour at St Helier as the row over post-Brexit fishing rights between the UK and France dramatically escalated on Thursday. A freight ship was initially trapped and unable to leave Channel islandaposs main port, but was later allowed to pass as a flotilla of French boats - backed by Brussels - crowded the harbour from about am. Angry French fishermen lot flares and waved banners calling for fishing access to the waters, with two local boats reportedly joining the demonstration as police and islanders watched the stand-off until the flotilla left at about pm following talks with Jersey ministers. The Royal Navyaposs HMS Severn and HMS Tamar, armed with machine guns and cannon, were positioned some distance away after being sent to the islandaposs main port to “monitor the situation” following mounting threats from Normandy trawlermen. France sent two police vessels to the area, including a former navy boat armed with cannon, as the situation in the British Crown dependency unfolded and a French fishing industry official warned weaposre ready for war. Prime Minister Boris Johnson reiterated his “unequivocal support” for Jersey during a phone call with island officials amid heightened tensions.Were you affected by the demonstration  Let us know at webnews@mirror. The Royal Navy vessels are set to remain in place as a precaution, Mr Johnson confirmed. Following the phone call, a Downing Street spokeswoman said: “The Prime Minister spoke to the Chief Minister of Jersey, Senator John Le Fondre, the Deputy Chief Minister, Lyndon Farnham and the Minister of External Affairs, Ian Gorst, this morning.“The Chief Minister updated the Prime Minister on the latest developments with French fishing vessels around Jersey’s coast.“The Prime Minister reiterated his unequivocal support for Jersey and confirmed that the two Royal Navy Offshore Patrol Vessels would remain in place to monitor the situation as a precautionary measure. “They agreed to stay in touch as the situation develops.” The row began after the island implemented new requirements under the terms of the UK-EU trade deal for boats to submit evidence of their past fishing activities in order to receive a licence to carry on operating in Jersey waters. French fisherman claim their rights are unfairly restricted. Earlier this week, David Sellam, head of the joint Normandy-Brittany sea authority, was quoted by French media as saying that Jersey had been taken over by an extremist fringe, who wanted to profit from Brexit.He added: Weaposre ready for war. We can bring Jersey to its kneesnecessary. Another skipper, Claude La Vaullée, said he and others had equipped their vessels to “re-stage the Battle of Trafalgar”. aposPatriotic dutyapos Jersey property developer Jonathan Ruff claims a French trawler deliberately rammed his boat as he went out to face the flotilla to stick up for the island and do his patriotic duty. Footage online showed two boats colliding in the harbour and witnesses shout oh following the sound of the impact. Mr Ruff told the Sun: I couldnapost believe what he was doing. He deliberately sped up and went straight for me clipping my bow. aposaposIf he had hit my engine I would have been in big, big trouble, I could have lost the boat and anything could have happened. aposaposThey were out of order andit wasnapost for some quick evasive action my boat could have been at the bottom of the Channel. Mr Gorst, Jersey’s External Affairs Minister, was among the local officials who took part in talks with the French fishermen amid the protest. He said the discussions were “positive”. He told BBC Radio aposs World at One programme: “It really is important that what has escalated over the course of the last three days, that we move away from that escalation and disproportionate threats, and start to deal with those detailed technical issues.  Earlier, Dimitri Rogoff, head of fisheries for the Normandy region, had told AFP the French boats would not try to block St Helier and wouldto France in the afternoon. The Commodore Goodwill freight ferry was initially unable to leave the harbour due to the flotilla crowding the harbour. Condor CEO Paul Luxon tweeted: Sadly she is trapped, we tried to bring her in earlier so in - discharge, load - out, and on her way, but in dialogue with Jersey Authorities ‘safety first’ of course.apos One of the trawlers positioned itself directly in front of the Commodore Goodwill, according to social media posts by Marie Carof-Gadel, a French journalist on board the trawler. The trawler later moved away and the delayed ferry left the port.The protest leader had instructed the vessels to let the ship leave, the Jersey Evening Post reported.  Two local boats from Jersey joined the protest, the report added. French fishermen were chatting via radio whether to push the protest further, but the consensus was no and they agreed to turn around and give the ferry room to leave the port, tweeted Paris-based Al Jazeera producer Tristan Redman, who was covering the scene in Jersey. The island sits  miles off the northern French coast and  miles south of Britainaposs shores. aposLike an invasionapos Jersey fisherman Josh Dearing described the scene at the port of St Helier on Thursday morning as “like an invasion”, with the French fleet mostly made up of “big French dredgers and trawlers” of  metres or more. Mr Dearing, , said: “There were probably about  boats. There were a few hand-held flares and smoke flares going off and apparently a few maybe bangers and stuff going off from the French.“It was quite a sight. It was impressive, I looked from the shore this morning and it was just like a sea of red lights and flares already going off at sea. It was like an invasion.” Originally from Kent, the owner of The Jersey Catch fishing company said the fleet was mostly made up of “big French dredgers and trawlers” of about  metres or more. There had been rumblings about a planned protest a few days ago, Mr Dearing said, but added that he had not been sureit was “serious or empty threats”.

They can blockade their own harbours – they wouldn’t think twice about coming and doing it to us.” He was “absolutely” pleased to hear on Wednesday night that Royal Navy vessels were being deployed to patrol the waters around Jersey. He said: “We’re completely unprotected in Jersey. We’ve got nothing except for a few police officers. We don’t have a police boat, we don’t have a navy boat, we don’t have anything to protect us. “The French can be hostile. All of our livelihoods are in that harbour andthey wanted to they could cause damage.” Mr Dearing, who said his fishing licence costs about £,, said French fishermen who have not been granted a licence to fish had “thrown their toys out of the pram”.  He said: “Jersey fisheries has done nothing wrong. They’ve issued the permits to the French fisherman that were entitled to them and the ones that aren’t entitled don’t get the permits and that’s just le, that’s how it is. “The guys that have historical rights [to fish] have been granted them, as they should’ve done, and the ones that haven’t have just thrown their toys out of the pram.” Hugo Lehuby, a representative for the Normandy regional fishing committee which helped organise Thursdayaposs protest, said the French flotilla would not seek to impede access to Jersey ports, or stop local fishing vessels from operating. Speaking to Reuters by phone, he said the boats wouldto France in the afternoon, adding: The objective is to express our unhappiness about the restrictive measures that were imposed. This is not a blockade, he said. Itaposs not our objective to smash stuff up. Paris threatens to cut power Paris has warned it could cut off power to the island, which receives  per cent of its electricity from France through three undersea cables, in retaliation for the fallout. Franceaposs threats to cut off Jerseyaposs electricity were clearly unacceptable and disproportionate, the UK Government said. French fishermen launched their protest a day after Mr Johnson told Mr Le Fondre and Mr Gorst they have his unwavering support. French maritime minister Annick Girardin warned on Tuesday that the country was ready to take retaliatory measures, accusing Jersey of dragging its feet over issuing new licences to French boats.  The European Commission has said that the terms of the EU UK trade deal are not being met in waters off the coast of Jersey, due to the conditions imposed on licences for French fishing boats there. Speaking before Jersey officials held talks with the French fishermen, Mr Gorst told BBC News: “He and I will, as I say, later this morning be going out to listen to the French fishermen. “It’s really important that we are able to work with those fishermen to help them provide the necessary evidence so that,required, their licences can be amended. “As I’ve said, it’s important that we respond to threats, but the answer to this solution is to continue to talk and diplomacy.” Mr Gorst said the demonstration had been peaceful, “which is what we would have expected”. UK aposmust respond firmlyapos to threats He said it is “important” that the Government responds “firmly” to “threats”. On Wednesday Mr Gorst held talks with Marc Lefevre, the president of the La Manche region of northern France, on the dficult set of issues relating to fishing licences. As the protest continued on Thursday, he said: “We’ve heard disproportionate threats from Paris and now with a potential blockade, but the answer to the issues that are being faced are without doubt talking and diplomacy.” Askedit was disproportionate to send Royal Navy vessels to patrol the waters around Jersey, he said: “A minister in Paris threatened over technical issues on fishing licences to cut off Jersey’s electricity. “We have to take such threats seriously and respond appropriately.  “And fishing vessels threatened to blockade the main harbour into the island. “Again, we have to take that seriously and we’re extremely grateful to the Prime Minister for his full support and, as he said last night, those assets in Jersey waters are as a precautionary measure to monitor what’s happening in our waters and, as I’ve said, so far the protest has been peaceful, as we would expect.” Mr Gorst said the French have made clear their “frustration” over the new Brexit trade deal. He added: “But we are in a new era of relationship with the European Union. That is governed by the Brexit trade deal and we believe that it can serve our interest as well as the interests of French fishermen into the future. “We cannot look back to the previous arrangements. They have gone. We must make the new trade deal work in all of our interests.” Stephanie Yon-Courtin, a French MEP and member of the EU Fisheries Committee, called on Jersey residents and the UK Government to “understand that our fishermen need to carry on working”.  “This situation is all the more sad because historically Jersey and the French fisherman have always had very cordial and pretty good relations for the past decade,” she told BBC Radio ’s Today programme. “Some of Jersey’s people need to understand, and Jersey’s government and UK Government, have to understand that our fishermen need to carry on working. Askedshe supported the threat that power could be cut off to Jersey in the future, she added: “I’m just saying that at the last resort,we don’t have any other means to be understood, then we will have to consider that. “We don’t want to do that, I don’t think it’s good, I don’t think it’s good for anybody.” The European Commission said terms of the EU UK trade deal were not being met in waters off the coast of Jersey. European Commission spokeswoman Vivian Loonela told a Brussels briefing: “On April , the commission was notied by the UK authorities of granting  licences to the EU vessels who are fishing in Jersey territorial waters from May . “But there were additional conditions set to these licences. “We have, following the receiving of this, indicated to the UK that we see that the provisions of the EU UK Trade and Co-operation Agreement, that we recently agreed, have not been met there, have not being respected.” France sends police boats as tensions rise Royal Navy crew on board HMS Severn, previously used to shadow Russian navy warships off the English coast, and HMS Tamar watched Thursdayaposs demonstration from a considerable distance. The ships are used for fisheries protection and sailors are allowed to board other vessels for spot checks. Former British ambassador Craig Murray said he could “not believe how stupid, on every level, it is to send gunboats”. The former head of the marine section at the Foreign Office tweeted: I personally negotiated the UK fisheries agreement between France and the Channel Islands in, while Head of Maritime Section at the FCO. It was heated, esp in Cherbourg. A UK Ministry of Defence spokesman said earlier: HMS Severn and HMS Tamar are deploying to Jersey to conduct maritime security patrols. This is a strictly precautionary measure and has been agreed with the Jersey Government.  A Downing Street spokesman added: The Prime Minister and Chief Minister stressed the urgent need for a de-escalation in tensions and for dialogue between Jersey and France on fishing access. The Prime Minister underlined his unwavering support for Jersey. He said that any blockade would be completely unjustied. As a precautionary measure the UK will be sending two offshore patrol vessels to monitor the situation. They agreed the UK and Jersey Governments would continue to work closely on this issue. Athos, a French police vessel named after one of the Three Musketeers, was sent on a patrol mission just outside Jerseyaposs exclusive economic zone on Thursday morning. Athos was transferred to the National Gendarmerie in  after some two decades of service with the French Navy proper.A second French police patrol boat, called Themis, was also sent to the area. A French maritime gendarmerie spokesman said: ‘The Athos is carrying out a patrol mission in the area.  John Healey MP, Labour’s shadow defence secretary, said the threats on Jersey are completely unreasonable, as he urged the Government to meet with their French counterparts and the islandaposs authorities. He added: The Navy’s experience in sensitive situations will help reassure residents and protect Britain’s broader national interests. “The British Government must now get round the table with French colleagues and authorities in Jersey and sort this issue out.” Jersey fishermen aposnot very happyapos Don Thompson, president of Jersey Fishermen’s Association, said the “big question on everybody’s lips right now is whether the UK Government would give in to the tactics of the French. He told Good Morning Britain: “The French fishermen out there want conditions removed from their licences so that they can fish with no constraints in our waters, whilst our boats are subject to all sorts of conditions about how much they can catch, where they can go.” He said it would be “grossly unfair”the Government does “capitulate to that” and said such tactics might be used “again and again in the future”. He added: “They’re not very happy fishermen down here this morning, suspecting that we probably will see our Government give in to that.” Mr Thompson said Jersey’s fishermen had told the Government they are prepared to ditch their fishing licencesthe French win their demands.

Meghan Markle and Prince Harryaposs little boy is celebrating his special day in America, where the Sussexes have been living since quitting the royal family last year. To mark the day, Kate and William shared a photo taken at Archieaposs christening on Insagram and Twitter.The snap, taken by Chris Allerton, shows the Cambridges, Sussexes, Prince Charles, Camilla, Meghanaposs mum Doria and Princess Dianaaposs sisters. Prince Charles and Camilla also shared a snap to mark the day, but opted for a photo without Meghan. They reshared a picture that Harry and Meghan shared on Fatheraposs Day, showing Harry with his father and son at his christening. They wrote: Happy birthday to Archie, who turns two today. The Queen posted one of the photos taken at the photocall where Meghan and Harry introduced the world to Archie, in place of the traditional hospital steps photo. She wrote: Wishing Archie Mountbatten-Windsor a very happy nd birthday today. The birthday message comes after a dficult few months for brothers William and Harry and countless reports of tension between the couples. William was reportedly furious when his younger brother quit The Firm, with insiders saying he was only given about  minutes notice.  Things were made even worse by Meghan and Harryaposs interview with Oprah Winfrey, in which they made several shocking claims about the royal family. Harry said his brother was trapped in the institution while Meghan accused Kate of making her cry. Meghan also claimed she wasnapost able to get help for her mental health during her time in the royal family, despite having suicidal thoughts. She told Oprah she didnapost want to be alive anymore.

Thanks to their wealth and notoriety, Meghan Markle and Prince Harry will have a range of experts available to themneeded when their baby girl arrives and they juggle raising two young children and holding down careers. Given their multi-million pound deals with Netflix and Spoty, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex can afford to have a day nanny and a night nanny, and extra help from the likes of a maternal wellbeing therapist or a nutritionist, say parenting experts. Heavily-pregnant Meghan, , is due to give birth this summer, reportedly as soon as early June, and royal watchers expect she will lean on her mum Doria Ragland, , for help. The girl will join birthday boy Archie, who turns two today, and be the Sussexesapos second child since their wedding in . The American duchess gave birth to son Archie at the exclusive and private Portland hospital in London in May , and rumours have suggested she could opt for a home birth in the coupleaposs mansion in suburban Los Angeles this time. Ms Ragland, who spent time with the couple at Frogmore Cottage in Windsor after Archieaposs birth, lives close to the couple and is expected to provide similar support when her granddaughter is born. Harryaposs family is , miles away and he relies on video calls to keep in touch with the Queen and other family members who are still speaking to him amid a rt that was widened by the Sussexesapos bombshell interview with Oprah Winfrey. Meghan is estranged from her father Thomas Markle Snr, who is orced from her mother, and her paternal half-siblings Thomas Markle Jnr and Samantha Markle. Keep up to date with all the latest news from the Queen, Charles, William, Kate, Harry, Meghan, George, Charlotte, Louis, Archie and the rest of the family. Weaposll send the best Royal news directly to your inbox so you never have to miss a thing.to our newsletter here. With limited family support, the Sussexes will have their hands full as they raise two children while running their documentary and podcast empire, and doing charity work. When Archie was born, reports claimed Meghan and Harry had just one nanny for him, but had tried out three in his first three months. Parenting experts said the Sussexes could turn to multiple nannies and other experts for help with their two children, especiallyMeghan doesnapost take a y period of maternity leave. Sophie Pickles, an early years teacher and parenting coach, told the Mirror: “Meghan and Harry may choose to hire a team of two or more nannies to help care for Archie and the new baby. “It is not uncommon for royals or the extremely wealthy to do so, often employing one nanny to stay in the house overnight to help with frequent night wakes and one or more to take care of the children during the day. “We know that when Archie was born, Meghan and Harry decided to hire a nanny to help them after initially saying they wouldnapost do so. “As for all of us, it sometimes takes until the baby is born for new parents to realise what a challenge it can be.” She added: “We already know that Harry and Meghan have stated that they do not want their home to be filled with staff, so it is unlikely that the new nanny will live with them. “All parents of multiple children know, however, that two is more challenging than one and with Archie about to hit the tumultuous age of two, they may well change their minds.”  It’s not known how much time self-employed Meghan and Harry will take from work off following the birth of their baby girl. As for how they could do things dferently this time, the couple could lean more on Ms Ragland and close friends. Ms Pickles said: “With Meghanaposs mum living close by, it is likely that she will be called upon to offer support and help, not only for Meghan as she recovers from birth but in caring for Archie while the family adjusts to having a new member. “After all, even when you have all the money in the world, there is nothing quite like the reassurance of leaving your baby in the arms of someone that you love and trust.” Royal biographer Angela Levin said itaposs possible the Sussexes will have more help around them after this birth, given they will have two children to take care of while running a business and doing charity work. The author of Harry: Conversations with the Prince told the Mirror: Meghan’s mother will want to help them and be involved, and the second one will be very close to her. I thinkwill rethink those early weeks . First-time mothers think they can do everything themselves. She might well have a night nanny and day nanny to help her, particularlyshe is working. You can’t juggle two in the same way that you can juggle one. I imagine a lot of money will come rolling in before she gives birth. They will be able to afford it.  Meghan and Harry, , are fortunate to have the kind of wealth and celebrity status that provide a gateway to experts and services most parents could never afford. The rich and famous in Los Angeles aren’t afraid to hire help or spend ridiculous amounts of money to get aposthe bestapos for their newborn.After her daughter Stormi Webster was born in February , reports claimed Kylie Jenner had four nannies.Kim Kardashian is said to have an “army” of nannies to help her care for the four children she had with Kanye West.Ms Pickles said: “While some of us can seek the services of sleep or lactation consultants for a one-off session, Meghan and Harry would be able to hire personal advisors to answer questions day and night. “They could take the form of an occupational therapist, paediatric doctors and physiotherapists, day and night nannies, a parent coach, a sleep consultant, a lactation consultant or a family counsellor - not to mention a personal trainer specialising in postpartum exercise, a nutritionist, a chef and a housekeeper.”  Lucy Shrimpton, founder of the Sleep Nanny, said Meghan and Harry could try to take on as much as they can on their own. She said: “Meghan and Harry are in a very privileged position that they have the means to pay for as much help as they could possibly need. “However, Meghan and Harry may want to do it as much as possible on their own. They seem like a very tight family, not afraid to get their hands dirty when it comes to all parenting responsibilities so they may try to be as self sufficient as possible.” Help from a sleep expert could set them up for long-term benefits such as the child’s development, and the familyaposs health and mental wellbeing. Ms Shrimpton added: “Being prepared with lots of rest before the baby arrives will be hugely beneficial for Meghan and Harry because the demands on parents of two will more than double. “Speaking from experience, where I went into labour already shattered with a -month-old, having plenty of time to rest beforehand will make a huge dference.  “Itaposs not as easy to catch up on sleep after having a baby when you have a toddler too. They may need to consider Archieaposs sleep and any adjustments to make to ensure he is not unsettled by the new sibling arriving into his world and demanding the attention of his parents.” Awena Naomie Ella, a matrescence specialist, motherhood wellbeing coach and occupational therapist, said Meghan could benefit from a specialist such as a maternal wellbeing therapist, who can help to set boundaries that allow for “rest, calm and connection”. She said: “Itaposs important to be aware of the hormonal, psychological, physiological, emotional, and spiritual changes a woman will move through. “Meghan’s wellbeing is the key to a safe and enjoyable entrance into this next phase of her and Harry’s le. “It is also important not to neglect or fail to acknowledge the emotional and wellbeing needs of Harry too. Ms Ella added: “Having access to a maternal wellbeing therapist or motherhood specialist, for example, can aid and support Meghan to embrace some simple and gentile wellbeing activates that fit into her current lestyle, and help her to prevent and manage any anxiety, possible onset of depression, overwhelm, and loss of sense of self that can sometimes come with early motherhood.

Many fans have praised the book and thousands have already pre-ordered a copy. However Majesty magazineaposs Ingrid Seward believes that one of the pages shows the coupleaposs feelings towards Harry losing his royal military positions following Megxit. The beautul illustration shows a ginger hair dad dressed in Army unorm being reunited with his son, who he throws in the air, while the mum watches on through the window.  Writing for the Sun, Ingrid points out that this is something Archie has never seen, adding: Maybe Meghan is sending us a coded message that Harry has still not got over losing his military titles after the Queen stepped in.She also accuses Meghan of being hypocritical for writing a book about fatherhoods when she is still not speaking to her own. Her relationship with Thomas Markle has been dficult since the royal wedding but things were made worse when he gave a copy of her emotional handwritten letter to the Mail on Sunday.  Ingrid writes: Nor am I surprised at Meghan’s hypocrisy in writing a book about the joy of father and son bonding when the relationship between Harry and his own father Prince Charles has been brought to an all-time low by their Oprah interview. Meghan’s estranged dad, Thomas, lives roughly  miles away but she has not taken Harry or Archie to see him. I suspect Mr Markle believes they never will make that journey or repair the relationship.Royal author Phil Dampier agrees with Ingrid, telling The Sun : Meghan is probably showing how much the Army meant to Harry and how upset he is to lose his military titles.For Harry, who put his le on the line and then founded the highly successful Invictus Games for injured servicemen and women, losing the titles was the bitterest part of ‘Megxit.’  The Bench is being released through publisher Random House, and the cover features her royal title, The Duchess of Sussex. In a statement, Meghan said: The Bench started as a poem I wrote for my husband on Fatheraposs Day, the month after Archie was born,aposapos Meghan said in a statement. That poem became this story. My hope is that The Bench resonates with every family, no matter the makeup, as much as it does with mine.” It is narrated by award winning artist Christian Robinson Meghan, who is described as a mother, we, feminist and activist in the bio, will narrate the audiobook.

Sophie Bugg, , was  weeks pregnant when she popped to the loo in the middle of the night - only to leave the bathroom with a baby less than a minute later. Her partner Chris, , had to act fast as Sophie appeared outside the bathroom door with the babyaposs head between her legs. With just one big push, baby Millie was born into her astonished dadaposs arms. Despite her extremely quick arrival, she is doing well with her family at their home in Basingstoke, Hampshire. Full time mum-of-three Sophie said: She was ridiculously fast! One moment Iaposm texting my friend on the toilet about needing a poo and seconds later, Iaposve got a baby in my arms. Actually pushing her out from when the lady on the phone told me to push only lasted  seconds, it was so fast. I had no pains and my waters hadnapost broken, there was no realisation I was having her at all. It sounds really crude but it just felt like I needed to go for a poo.Have you got a birth story  Email webnews@mirrorI had messaged my friend saying I donapost feel great, then put the phone down from where I was sat on the loo and went to get up from the toilet. As I went to lt myself up, my body just got that feeling like I needed to push for a poo. So I sat back down, pushed, and as soon as I did that push, I knew it was not from behind! I put my hand between my legs and her head was completely out. I shouted to my partner for help, went from the toilet to outside my toilet door on the top of the stairs, did one push and she was out! This isnapost the first time that Sophie has been taken by surprise by her speedy deliveries.  Back in , the mum went to the toilet in the middle of the night and ended up delivering her first baby, Paige, now eight, just  minutes later. Little Paige was born still in her sac, which is why Sophieaposs waters didnapost break, and a paramedic was able to pop the sac safely. Sophie was then booked in for an induction for her second child Lexie, now two, to ensure she was in hospital this time around. She gave birth to Lexie just  minutes after being induced.  She said: My first baby was quite an experience - you donapost expect anything like that with your first labour, to just be at home and then all of a sudden youaposve got a baby. You donapost know what to expect. You get told all these dferent things from people like youaposre going to have a show, youaposll have waters go, so youaposre waiting for these things to happen and they didnapost for me so I didnapost think I was giving birth until her head was out. My second baby, the doctors were so worried with the fact of how quickly I had my first that they had me induced so I was in hospital with my second, which was a relief. But then my third baby had the exact same plans as my first, but came even quicker! I couldnapost believe how quickly she arrived.  My body doesnapost give me the signs of labour. My midwe and my consultant told me that I go from zero to baby, I donapost dilate like every normal person does. Sophie had been booked in to be induced a whole week before Millie was born but the cheeky little girl decided she was ready to come even earlier. Two days before her planned induction, Sophie woke up in the early hours of the morning on March  with the urge to go to the toilet. She texted her friend to say she didnapost feel well and that she was going to go into the garden for some fresh air but her pal quickly warned her not to in case she gave birth.  But by the time her friendaposs advice came through on her phone, Sophie had already given birth to her newborn after pushing out her head instead of a aposnumber twoapos. She did one more big push outside the toilet door with her panicked partner Chris, who works as a storeman, in front of her - and baby Millie was born. Sophie said: I sat on the toilet, literally did a push and had the feeling that I should feel between my legs because it didnapost feel like a poo. I put my hand down and I just felt her head! It was four in the morning, it was just so unexpected. I was calling Chrisapos name as her head came out but so much energy was going into me giving birth, I felt like the lady off of Titanic, shouting aposhelpapos but it wasnapost coming out loud enough! I thought heaposs not going to wake up but then when I got off the toilet, he was stood there in the doorway so he must have heard me. I just looked at him and said aposyouaposve got to do the rest!apos His face dropped but then the phone came out, he was talking to the paramedics, it all happened so fast.  My two other kids both woke up in the commotion as well so I had my eight year old poking her head round her bedroom door asking aposMummy, are you ok apos Iaposm like aposyeah, Iaposm ok darling, just stay in your room for a minute!apos I went from sat on the toilet to outside my toilet door on the top of the stairs, did one push and she was out! I asked Chris afterwardshe was alright and he was like aposyeah, that was mad!apos Sophie remained on top of her stairs cradling her new born with the placenta still inside her for  minutes before a paramedic arrived. The umbilical cord was cut and Sophie and Millie were taken to hospital to be checked over but were released after a couple of hours in perfect health. Sophie said: I was shocked when I gave birth to my first so quickly but Iaposm just in disbelief that I ended up giving birth at home once again and even quicker! I had no pain relief with two of my kids and the after-pain with my third was terrible from where I was straining so much because I thought she was a poo. I was left so sore for weeks - I literally felt like a baboon!  I hear peopleaposs stories and I know several people who have been in labour for  hours and I canapost possibly imagine that! Iaposve never experienced that - my longest labour was  minutes and Iaposve had three children. I do feel sorry for these people who have to go through it!

A photo of the sweet treat on a wall inside the store sparked a backlash from regulars in Truro. The image depicted a scone with cream spread on the bottom and a dollop of jam on the top. People in Cornwall have always put jam on first while folk in neighbouring Devon start with the clotted cream. Disgusted customers contacted Sainsburyaposs to complain, and as a result the supermarket chain apologised and quietly removed the photo from the baked goods aisle, CornwallLive reports. Who does a cream tea the proper way - Cornwall or Devon  Join the conversation in the comments section below. An empty frame now hangs on the wall where the picture was displayed. Sainsburyaposs said it had nothing more to say about the saga, which went viral. Earlier, Sainsburyaposs had said: Our afternoon tea has all scone wrong in Truro! We are reviewing the customer feedback we have received. Andreas Drosiadis, who took the original photo and runs the Mediterraneo deli in Truro, posted the image on Facebook asking: How did this happen   Andreas, , said: England is a country with strong local traditions that shape our everyday le.

Andreasapos tweet went viral and renewed the debate over how to dress a scone - is it jam first or clotted cream  Originally from Greece, the deli owner said: Because the clotted cream is denser than the jam, the jam should go first and the clotted cream after so everything stays neat and clean without the jam pouring on your fingers. He added: We now have the British authority on etiquette to back up the argument. Thataposs how the Queen has it. On Twitter user wrote: Sainsburyaposs are correct.

She said: A mostly dry start for much of England where we will see some sunshine but it will be chilly. The temperatures will yet again struggle, itaposs going to be a chilly day. It comes after widespread rain, hailstones and even lightning were seen across the country on Wednesday. Looking ahead to the coming days Alex Burkill, a Met Office forecaster, said: For the rest of the week, rainfall will be rather hefty in some places, with as much as -mm falling in just an hour in the worst-affected spots.  A signicant amount of hail could potentially cause some disruption to roads and public transport. He said heavy downpours will then lash the country on Saturday. He added: Most areas will be affected by heavy and persistent rain and strong winds over the weekend. Sunday should be drier for most, with some showers in places, but in the south-east of England, temperatures could climb into the low twenties by the afternoon.  People should make the most of any dry or sunny spots, as it is unlikely to last and the rest of May will be unsettled and changeable for everyone.

A year later, the couple are carving out a new le including million-dollar business deals, celebrity pals and a Calornian mansion. In their quitting statement, Meghan and Harry said they planned to raise Archie with an appreciation for the royal tradition into which he was born but with space to focus on the next chapter. To mark his second birthday, weaposve taken a look at what Archieaposs post-royal le is like and how it dfers to his cousins Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis. Family While Archie is growing up on the other side of the Atlantic to his royal family, heaposs just up the road from his other grandmother - Meghanaposs mum Doria. The Duchess is extremely close to her mum and she was in the room supporting her daughter through Archieaposs birth. Itaposs likely that Doria has played a big role in Archieaposs le so far and spends lots of time with him.  However the distance means heaposs not been able to enjoy the company of Charles and Camilla, nor his Uncle William or Auntie Kate. While Harry was reunited with his family at his grandfather Prince Philipaposs funeral last month, Archie and heavily pregnant Meghan stayed at home. However Archie has been able to see his cousins, aunt and uncle, and grandparents via video call during the pandemic.The Sussexes also spoke regularly to the Queen and Prince Philip before his death last month.Photos and the public eyeWhile Kate and William release photos of their children, Meghan and Harry have unsurprisingly shared far fewer images of their son since quitting royal le.The couple decided against the tradition of posing for photos on the hospital steps following the birth and instead arranged a photocall for a small group of the media a few days later. The couple also kept the christening as a private celebration but released two official photos from the day.Before shutting down their Sussex Royal Instagram page they shared a handful of snaps, including a picture of his foot in front of Princess Dianaaposs favourite flowers to mark Motheraposs Day and one of Archie and Charles on the Prince of Walesaposs birthday.Since stepping down Meghan and Harry have used the publication of new photos to promote charities they are passionate about.For his first birthday, they shared an adorable video of Meghan reading her son his favourite book, Rabbit! Duck!. Love the royals for our daily royal newsletter by clicking here.It was shared as part of Save the Childrenaposs Save with Stories campaign, which aims to raise funds for children and families struggling due to the coronavirus crisis in the UK and around the world.They stuck with the royal familyaposs tradition of sharing a Christmas photo, however used a digitally sketched picture rather than a photo. The arty card, which shows the couple, Archie and their two dogs playing in a Wendy house, was released in partnership with animal welfare charity Mayhew, which Meghan is patron of.  Archie also appears in one of the two photos released by the couple when they announced they are expecting their second child, a baby girl.Archie also made a guest appearance on his parentsapos debut podcast for Archewell Audio.After speaking to the likes of Sir Elton John and James Cordon on the holiday special, the proud parents brought little Archie to the microphone, with Harry saying: You can speak into it. Meghan then asks: Archie is it fun  and he repeats the word fun. The tot then copies his dad to say Happy New Year, followed by an adorable giggle. The couple shared a rare video of Archie playing on the beach as part of their controversial interview with Oprah Winfrey.  Home leIf the Sussexes had stayed in the UK, Archie would have grown up in the stunning Frogmore Cottage.The house, in the grounds of Windsor Castle, was a wedding gt to Meghan and Harry from the Queen.  Before this, there had been plans for the couple to move into one of the bigger apartments in Kensington Palace, just a few doors up from the Cambridges. This would have allowed Archie to spend a lot of time with his cousins and other family members. But instead, little Archie spent a few months in Canada before Meghan and Harry moved into movie producer Tyler Perryaposs LA house.Last summer they bought their first proper family home, a stunning £.million pad in Montecito, Santa Barbara."},{"url":null,"title":"inside archies birthday celebrations meghan","story":":root Inside Archies birthday celebrations with Meghan, Harry and royal Zoom callsArchie has turned two years old and will be celebrating his second birthday at the multi-million pound luxury mansion he shares with parents Meghan Markle and Prince Harry in CalorniaInside Archies birthday celebrations with Meghan, Harry and royal Zoom callsArchie has turned two years old and will be celebrating his second birthday at the multi-million pound luxury mansion he shares with parents Meghan Markle and Prince Harry in CalorniaFans will be hoping to see fresh pictures of rarely young Archie as he marks his second birthdayImage: Getty ImagesByTalia ShadwellReporter:,  May Updated:,  May  Birthday boy Archie is set to get some face time with the Queen, Prince William and Kate Middleton on his special day, an insider claims. Senior royals are expected to put aside their rt with Prince Harry and Meghan Markle for at least a few hours mark their sonaposs special milestone.The couple are living with Archie in a multimillion-pound luxury mansion in Montecito, Calornia, where he will turn two today more than , miles away from his royal relatives in Britain. The Sussexes are expected to celebrate the toddleraposs birthday with a Zoom call to his grandmother, the Queen, and a call with his aunt and uncle, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. While fans eagerly wait to see whether they Sussexes will release any special new photos of rarely seen Archie on his big day, his loved ones have already wished the youngster a happy birthday publicly.The Queen, in a message on the official royal family Twitter account, accompanied by a photograph of her great-grandson with his parents days after he was born, said: Wishing Archie Mountbatten-Windsor a very happy nd birthday today.Also sending him warm tidings from afar, Harryaposs brother, Kate and William wished Archie a very happy birthday, alongside another christening photo showing the family together. Charles and his we, Camilla the Duchess of Cornwall, shared a photo of Harry proudly showing Archie off to the childaposs grandfather at his christening.  Speaking to OK, royal author Katie Nicholl said: “Harry... always wanted his children to grow up close to William and Kate’s. That would be the childhood he enjoyed with his own cousins, Zara, Beatrice and Eugenie. Sadly it’s looking increasingly unlikely for Archie.“Very little is known about how much the brothers have spoken in recent months and what the situation is between them, but I find it hard to imagine that the Cambridges won’t at least pick up the phone on Archie’s birthday.” Ms Nicholl also speculated a video call with Her Majesty will take place on her grandsonaposs birthday.  She said: “We know that Harry still speaks regularly with his grandmother and one of the Queen’s joys is to see Archie. I’m sure there will be a Zoom call with her on his special day,” she says. Fans will be hoping the couple follow royal tradition and release a picture of Archie to mark his second birthday.Archie has only been seen rarely during the past  months, during the coronavirus pandemic which saw him celebrate his first birthday in lockdown with his parents in Calornia during its aposstay at homeapos orders last May.He was shown in a black and white video clip released in March during his parentsapos bombshell interview with Oprah Winfrey.  The never-seen-before black and white footage showed him walking along a beach watched by his parents and the familyaposs pet dog, Guy. As he walked towards his father, who filmed the moment, the youngster ducked down and walked through the gap in his legs.The couple also offered fresh insights into his le Stateside during the explosive interview.Harry revealed details including that Archie likes being taken on bike rides in his baby seat, where he sticks his arms out and shouts woooo and points out passing sights. Meghan said Archie,has been on a roll in learning to talk, and his current favourite word is hydrate. Harry recently told James Corden that Archieaposs first word was crocodile. When Archie made a surprise appearance in the Sussexesapos first podcast for Spoty in December, the little boyaposs American accent could clearly be heard as he was encouraged to say a few words for the audience.  He was also glimpsed with his face turned away from the camera in one of Meghan and Harryaposs pregnancy announcement pictures the couple shared earlier this year. In the picture announcing they were having a baby girl, Meghan stands under a tree holding Archie as Harry embraces her. Meghan this week revealed her son and husband and their special bond was the inspiration behind her first childrenaposs book, The Bench. She says the book was based on a poem she wrote for Harry on Fatheraposs Day after their son was born.Archie was born on May   at .am, weighing lb oz, and a few days after his birth his parents proudly showed him to the world, before the Queen and Prince Philip saw him for the first time.The late Duke of Edinburgh sadly missed out on marking his grandsonaposs second birthday.

But, every now and then bizarre and worrying trends begin on the video sharing app, which leave you thinking, aposWTF !apos One of said trends is a highly dangerous so-called aposhackapos which sees people trying to use perfume and hair straighteners to dye their hair. No, seriously. Weaposre just going to have to say it. Donapost ever try this yourself, unless you want to risk getting electrocuted and ruining your expensive GHDs in the process. Please, just donapost.  The trend started when TikTok influencer Agbe sprayed a bottle of perfume onto her hair straighteners, before gliding the straighteners over her bright blue hair and seemingly turning it pink.The eagle-eyed among us will notice the clip changes between her spraying the perfume onto the straighteners and her using them on her hair, as well as the second hand carefully placed below the straighteners. And, as ridiculous as it sounds, other TikTok users quickly started attempting to dye their own hair using perfume and straighteners, and spoiler alert: it doesnapost work.  Unsurprisingly, people quickly started commenting with their own suspicions, with one user writing: You can literally see the pink powder on the straighteners, lol. Firstly, the straightener wasnapost plugged in, and secondly there was pink powder on the straightener and she was holding the pink powder, another wrote. Still, that didnapost stop others from giving it ago, and several videos have emerged on the site showing young girls spraying perfume directly onto their piping hot straighteners.

Vickie, , from Benton, Tennessee, USA, decided to keep Bo in the spare room while at work the next day, in order to avoid more damage. But determined Bo chewed his way out of the wire crate and broke down the door. Vickie, who works in HR, said: “We’d only had the couch for four months when it all happened.  “Bo sleeps on the couch a lot, that is definitely his domain. He loves it.“I was at work, and I was getting alerts from my pet camera that something was happening, but I thought it was just Bo being Bo.“Never in a million years did I think he was destroying my couch.“I got home that afternoon and the dogs were greeting me at the door. I took a few steps inside and started seeing this white fluff everywhere.“Once I got to the living room, that’s when I saw the couch. My first thought was that I had been robbed and vandalised.“But then I saw the TV on the wall, and I thought, well why would they tear the couch up and leave the TV “Bo then sits down in the middle of the mess, wagging his tail. He was very happy with himself.“That’s when it all clicked.

I thought he’s going to have a good day.“When I came home from work, there he was at the door. I thought ‘oh no, this cannot be good’.“There was a massive hole in my son’s door, and he had chewed his way through the crate.“I panicked because I thought he had cut his mouth to pieces, so I took him to the vet. But he was totally fine.”After visiting the vet, Bo was diagnosed with severe separation anxiety and has been put on a low dose of ‘puppy xanax’ to help keep him calm.Thankfully the pooch is doing a lot better and went viral after Vickie shared photos of the damage on social media.Vickie said: “The medicine seems to be working, I think it’s just what he needed.

Johnny Walker has had his eight-year-old Bredli carpet pythons, Jasper and Cairo, for two years. But the -year-old from Queensland, Australia says women think he’s out of his mind when he shows them pictures of the slippery pair cuddled up in bed with him. Despite suffering several nasty bites in his four years of handling snakes, Johnny says his pet pythons are like family and wants to find a woman who will accept them as part of the package. The electrical salesman said: “People are scared about coming over but I don’t know why. “Previous girlfriends would leave me instantly when they saw them and say: aposI’m not dealing with thoseapos. “Now when I show girls the pictures a lot of them think I’m out of my mind. “They slither up onto the bed and I leave them there because they like to be under the covers and warm. “When I go to bed usually one of them is already in there by himself so I’ll just get the other one and they usually just snuggle up together. “I never worry about them biting me or wrapping themselves round my neck, they just stay there all night and they love it. “They won’t have moved when I wake up in the morning.” Snake-lover Johnny has been passionate about serpents since he was six years old.

He has suffered some nasty bites while handling over  snakes in his le, but maintains every one has been his own fault. Now Johnny has a two-storey enclosure in his living room for Jasper and Cairo, who stay in there while he goes to work, but they have a free run of the house when he gets home. He feeds the snakes a rat the size of a kitten, which keeps their appetites satisfied for ten days - but the slippery pair still make many of Johnny’s guests nervous - including his own dad who rarely comes to visit because of the free-roaming reptiles. Johnny said: “Everybody freaks out whenever they come round.

Finding out I needed surgery was a shock.“It was only when I woke up from the surgery that it all hit me, how serious it was.“But I feel a lot stronger now and I just want to get back out there.”Almost four-and-a-half months passed between his injury in the Highlands to a substitute appearance in the - win over Raith Rovers.During that time Dundee have gone from revival to no hopers and then back to revival in their quest toto the Premiership.Now, though, they have found their groove and powered up the table to finish second after eight matches unbeaten.Jakubiak may only have been able to feature in four minutes of that run – and is critical of his own showing that day, too – but is delighted to be ing to fitness with Dundee in good fettle.mdash Alex JakubiakApril , He even credits the confidence around the camp as reason for making him work even harder to get back in.The Dark Blues are now four matches away from their goal of top-flight football.They await the winner of the Raith-Dunfermline play-off quarter-final this week.And Jakubiak says there will be no letting up from the Dark Blues, eventhey have a week off ahead of the semi-final.He added: “I was speaking to some of the lads and they said they couldn’t believe how quickly the season had gone but for me it’s the complete opposite.“Just being in the gym working, watching the games and seeing the guys train, as frustrating as it is, has helped me come through stronger.“I’ve got a more positive mindset coming back to training and the way the guys have been, it’s made me work that bit harder to get up to the fitness levels needed to match the rest of the lads.“It’s been a tough season physically but mentally as well. I do feel I’ve come out of what you might say is a dark place but can now see the light at the end of the tunnel.“The mood around the club has been very positive. We know the situation we’re in.#All season we’ve been going into games believing we can win because we are a big club and need to have that mindset.“We feel we shouldn’t be in this league but that’s the situation we find ourselves in.#Now we have got into this situation we don’t want to waste all the hard work we have put in till now.“So we’re going to push even harder from now till the end of the play-offs.”Jakubiak is pushing for ato action before the end of the season but knows how much is on the line for the Dark Blues.With that in mind, he’s aware game time will not come easily with promotion at stake.But he’ll do his part when called upon.“I’ve been desperate to get back out there from day one in the gym!” he added.“That’s my mindset, I’m just eager to play and show what I can do. It’s been tough and frustrating recently not being able to play.“It was good to get a few minutes at the end of the Raith game, it felt good.#Although I am very self-critical and I know their goal was partly my fault.#Even that, regardless of my injury, I know there are parts of my game I can work on and improve on. That will only come with playing games.“I will keep working hard and I will hopefully get a chance in these games.“It will be tough, though, because the lads have been doing so well.“The performance on Friday night at Queens was pretty comfortable. We were good all over the pitch, solid at the back and Jason got his two goals. He’s in great form.“It will be tough to get into the team but all I can do is keep working.“As much as I want to play every minute, the only thing that matters is we win the ties. Our ultimate goal is promotion.“So whichever team the manager picks, he has a lot of fit, strong, lads who are ready to go. Whoever he picks will do a good job.# Shaun Byrne is determined to relive the best moment of his career by helping Dundee to promotion # and he says the Dark Blues are a better side than his Livingston play-off winners\" title\"#Shaun Byrne is determined to relive the best moment of his career by helping Dundee to promotion #

and then some.Ten-time Scottish Cup winners # all before  # Scotland#s oldest club will find themselves in League One next season and, hopefully, playing at a redeveloped Lesser Hampden as a club resurgent in the professional game.For Dundee United defender Liam Smith, however, his experience of playing Queen#s Park is as an amateur outfit steeped in tradition.In a loan spell at East Fe in  , while on the books at Hearts, the right-back played against the Glasgow side in front of  or so fans at Hampden and was on the losing end both times.No doubt, it was an eerie experience for a young kid but one Smith, now , feels will stand him in good stead for United#s Scottish Cup semi-final against Hibs at a near-empty national stadium on Saturday.He said: “I never played at Hampden with Hearts# first team but I played there for East Fe against Queens Park!“It will be similar this time because it was empty so I know what that’s like.“I’m looking forward to it but just gutted it won’t be full because I’m sure both sets of supporters would’ve brought a great support.“Having seen what it means to the United fans from their send off for the quarters # and they’ve sold loads of season tickets # we know the support is there going into it.“Nobody needs to tell us how big a game it is and we’re all looking forward to it.”Although they are yet to get one over the Hibees since theirto the Premiership this season, Smith believes the Tangerines have as good a chance as anyone of going all the way.Smith, who captained the Jambos in a  Youth Cup Final loss to Motherwell at the national stadium, is hopeful for a positive result against his old Edinburgh rivals to set up a showpiece against St Johnstone or St Mirren.“I don’t think form, particularly, comes into it and they got beat on Saturday as well ,# the Fer added.“It’s just  minutes, two teams and the previous games against them don’t count for much.“It’s a one-off, the occasion takes care of itself.“We’ve done our research on them, we’ve played them a few times already as well so we know about them.“We’re building up to the game seeking a positive result.“It’s anybody’s cup now isn’t it “The Old Firm are always favourites but when they go out and it’s down to four teams everyone thinks: ‘What a chance we’ve got’.“I’m sure all the teams will be thinking that but, equally,we can put in a performance like we did against Aberdeen then why can it not be us ”Last weekend#s - Premiership defeat to Ross County at Tannadice wasn#t the ideal way for the Terrors to warm-up for Saturday#s massive clash # a repeat of the  semi.Although he is convinced the United squad weren#t distracted by the Hibs match as they failed to replicate their performance in a - quarter-final win over Aberdeen, Smith says they have to put the County disappointment behind them.“I don’t think so but you know it’s there because it’s a massive game.# he said when askedthey had one eye on the semi-final.“I think you’ve got to be professional and take one game at a time so there was no speaking about it through the week.Dundee United analysis: Ross County get it right against road-weary Tangerines unable to stop eyes wandering towards Hampden humdinger\" title\"#Dundee United analysis: Ross County get it right against road-weary Tangerines unable to stop eyes wandering towards Hampden humdinger# #

will find out next weekthey are to be crowned World Scotch Pie “Champion of Champions”.Pie aficionados were in Dunfermline on Tuesday when they tasted pies from  former World Scotch Pie champions to determine who is the best of the best.The judging took place under not just top secret but also strict social distancing conditions – and the winner of the ultimate accolade will have to wait until Wednesday May  to be crowned World Scotch Pie Champion of Champions .A total of  bakers and butchers from across Scotland, all of whom have previously held the title, were eligible to take part in this one-off competition created to allow some of Scotland’s best food artisans to shine in what has been a tough year all round for so many as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.Vying for the title are: Sugar and Spice of Auchterarder, The Kandy Bar of Saltcoats, James Pirie # Sons of Newtyle, Christie the Baker of Airdrie, Boghall Butchers of Boghall, Murrays Bakers of Perth, The Little Bakery of Dumfries, Brownings the Bakers of Kilmarnock, WF Stark of Buckhaven, Murdoch Brothers of Forres, Macleans Highland Bakery of Forres, Irvine’s Bakery of Beith, John G Renicks of Thornhill, Aulds Bakeries of Greenock, and RT Stuart of Buckhaven.All the mouth-watering pies were put to a blind taste-off at Bakers House, Scottish Bakers Dunfermline HQ, by two pie experts # head judge Ian Nelson and Paul Long, managing director of BAKO Northern and Scotland, who spent many hours putting the pastry perfections through their paces to determine which pie looked and tasted the best.Scottish Bakers, the trade association that supports the bakery industry in Scotland and which has organised The World Championship Scotch Pie Awards for the past  years, announced late last year that the competition would run this year, but with a slightly dferent format for  only.Each year, the title is hard-fought by butchers and bakers throughout Scotland and beyond but with coronavirus restrictions currently preventing gatherings, the  competition is being managed a little dferently.“Restrictions in place to combat Covid- meant that our annual November judging day was not possible and neither was the awards lunch in January,” said Scottish Bakers chief executive, Alasdair Smith.“So, we have taken the decision to run the competition, but with some changes for this year to ensure the awards retain their place in the annual calendar.“We invited all previous World Scotch Pie Champions to enter their winning Scotch pie into a  Champions of Champions competition. They were asked to submit their pies for a socially-distanced judging which was held blind to ensure each pie was judged on its own merits.”With judging now having taken place, the Champion of Champions will be announced on May , although everything is subject to possible change based on future changes to Covid- safety measures.Mr Long said: “I have judged this competition over many years and I have to say the standard of entries from past winners did not disappoint so selecting the best was a tough job but one pie did indeed stand out from the crowd.”Gordon King, executive manager of the competition partners, Scottish Craft Butchers, said: “Scottish Craft Butchers are delighted to support the champion of champions scotch pie evaluation“In these dficult times it is more important than ever to recognise the traditional skills and hard work that goes in to develop and produce a truly iconic Scottish product.“We look forward to seeing the past champions of butchers, bakers and all pie makers, do battle to see who will be crowned the best of the best.

This was really the first time I realised I should take performing seriously.#I worked with industry professionals who helped me navigate potential routes for pursuing a career in performing.#And in , after several auditions, I gained a place on the BA Musical Theatre course at Guildford School of Acting where I trained for three years and gained a first class degree from.#She added: #Since graduating I have been lucky enough to work fairly consistently.#My first job was playing the lead in Our House at the Union Theatre London and I then had a stint at Theatre Royal Stratford East developing some new writing.#Following that I was cast in the UK and International Tour of Grease. I played Miss Lynch and understudied Rizzo and Jan.#I actually went on for Rizzo when the show opened up in Aberdeen which was a real pinch me homecoming moment!#I ed to the Union Theatre in  to work on a beautul show called Elegies for Angels, Punks and Raging Queens which centralises around the Aids Epidemic, it altered my le as a performer and refocussed me immeasurably.#And then I was lucky enough to visit the Edinburgh Fringe and work on a devised play called Lipsync. This was based on the le of a woman called Kirsty Young, who starred alongside me.#Kirsty lives with cystic fibrosis and the play explored that condition in a moving and impactful way. We performed at Summerhall, winning the Lustrum award there and then went on to win a Fringe First.#Speaking on how her debut concert came to be a reality, the performer says she was approached by producer Shaun McCourt.Shaun has played a key role in bringing Ailsa#s show to le.She added: #Shaun, the producer of my show, had seen me in Elegies and wanted to work with new voices for this festival that my show is a part of # so that’s how it came about really.#I am so grateful to him for trusting me and giving me this .#My show#s title and theme are hugely inspired by The School of Le: An Emotional Education.#With arrangements and accompaniment by Flynn Sturgeon, my show features music that has had great influence over me during the course of her personal and professional le.#I’ll use song to explore being human, showing us how far we travel through living out our ordinary days and nights.#What I love most about it, and the thing viewers will love the most, is that it has a lot of heart and will feel like a real full-circle moment as live performances are finally permitted again.#She went on to say: #I can#t wait to get back to performing. It has been a really dficult year for everyone, the arts sector has literally ceased to exist and I cannot express how much it fills my heart to have actual performing dates in my diary.#Genuinely, all I want is to feel creative fulfilment in every avenue of work that I pursue.#I obviously have specic blue sky career moments. I’d love to work at the national one day and originate a role and break into screen work.#But honestly, I try to keep my mind open and like I say, as long as I gain creative fulfilment from my work I

success.Approximately  stallholders will be attending the spring market, with new additions including iced biscuit specialist Cookie Cookie Aberdeen and chocolate shop Pure Decadence by Loch Aurora.Longstanding favourites will also be in attendance, including The Cupcake Stop and The Bread Guy.Speaking of the event, The Duchess of Fe, director of Elsick Development Company which is leading the build of Chapelton, said: “The farmers’ markets are one of our most popular events.“Residents from the town and visitors love to browse the wide array of stalls that sell great local produce and products, from cut meat and dairy items to cakes and cocktails.“There will also be plenty of stalls selling food to take away, such as paella, pizzas and ice cream, so there’s a great choice for everyone.”The market forms a calendar of events hosted in the town, including a bike ride in September which will raise funds for charity North East Sensory Services.It will be open from am – :pm on Sunday May .

We are also looking for volunteers to support the service.There are an estimated , armed forces veterans in Scotland, with an average age of .  The Comradeship Circles also welcome their partners, widows, and widowers.Participants simply dial into the weekly chat, with a facilitator on hand to assistnecessary. The service is popular with those who are unable or find it dficult to enjoy social connection online.Our Comradeship Circles has been a social leline for many over the last six months, so we’re delighted this funding means they can continue. Even before the pandemic, thousands of older veterans still felt isolated because of health conditions, disabilities, or living in a rural location. Although restrictions are now easing, we know that many are feeling lonelier than ever before.While more and more older people are getting online, there are still hundreds of thousands who are unable or prefer not to use the internet. This telephone service has been especially valued by older veterans who have a disability or health condition which means they struggle to use the video conferencing apps.Comradeship Circles mean they can enjoy banter and share stories and memories of military le. It’s been inspiring to see the care and support that the veterans’ community give each other, helping each other through dficult time. Many participants have told us that they’ve rekindled old friendships or made new ones, or look forward to a natter to get them through the week.If you or someone you know is a veteran aged  or over, we’d encourage them to give it a try.A call to the Age Scotland helpline     can open the door to camaraderie and extra support for older members of the ex-service community.Brian Sloan, Age Scotland chief executive "},{"url":null,"title":"argyll gardens bloom for 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

It was not the practice to make public the particulars in cases where those responsible for criminal investigation were satisfied that no crime had been committed but he might mention, for the satisfaction of the honourable member and those on whose behalf the question was put, that on recovery of the body what was observed tended strongly to confirm the accuracy of the statements which had been made at the time by those who were with the deceased when the accident took place.#PICS:Alexander McNab, born Argyll in , at two stages in le. no_aMcNab_story_AlexClare#s great grandmother, Grace McNab Bridge, as a young woman in the early th century. no_aMcNab_story_GraceGrace in later years. no_aMcNab_story_GraceClare Frith has been researching her family history. no_aMcNab_story_ClarePrivate Andrew McNab, one of three McNab brothers killed during the First World War. no_aMcNab_story_Andrew"},{"url":null,"title":"shorter racing only scottish series planned","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Each route takes visitors on a real pilgrimage to ancient Christian landmarks, through remote and impressive landscapes.#Whilst Faith in Cowal is a Christian organisation, the routes are open to people of all faiths and none and provide the perfect way to connect with the wild beauty Cowal has to offer. Some of the sites that book-end each trail date as far back as the th and th centuries as well as more ancient landmarks such as Auchnaha Cairn that are thought to be Neolithic in origin.#The walks take in locations close to the major settlements and population centres of Cowal including Strachur, Dunoon, Kilfinan and Colintraive but they#re unlike any other path you#ll find. These are not all neatly manicured and waymarked trails. We have deliberately kept them dynamic and wild by making use of forestry roads and ancient heritage paths. Many of the routes require short, improvised hikes between paths so you#ll feel like a real pilgrim forging your way through the landscape.#There are detailed guides on our website as well as downloadable GPS tracks. We hope as many visitors to Cowal as possible will take this opportunity to step in the footsteps of ancient pilgrims and travellers, enjoy the wonderful scenery of Argyll and explore fascinating sites of genuine spiritual and religious importance,# added Dan.PICS:A map of the routes. no_aFootstepsFaithPhotos: subtlesensorHistoric Kilmun church, on the shores of the Holy Loch. no_aFootstepsFaith_©subtlesensor_Kilmorich graveyard, Cairndow. no_aFootstepsFaith_KilmorichGraveyard©subtlesensor"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor april 16 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

One of the highlights from last year’s event included celebrity supporters dressing up as much-loved characters to recreate tea party scenes from the world of film. Phyllis Logan was Mary Poppins, music producer Naughty Boy was Jay Gatsby, Emma Barton was Holly Golightly and Jess and Natalya Wright were Alice in Wonderland and the Queen of Hearts.Families with dementia have been adversely affected by the lockdown for just over a year. Care home visiting restrictions, the closure of support and respite services and the resulting social isolation and loneliness has disproportionately affected people living with dementia and their family carers.Whilst Time for a Cuppa will be slightly dferent this year, we know dementia support is needed more than ever. We are so grateful to all of our fundraisers who will be whipping up treats, enthusiasm, funds and giving their time for others – in a socially distanced way, of course – in what will be a very special and important Time for a Cuppa.For more information about Time for a Cuppa and how to host a tea party with our free fundraising pack, visit the dementiauk.org timeforacuppa webpage.Dr Hilda Hayo, Chief Admiral Nurse and Chief Executive Officer of Dementia UK."},{"url":null,"title":"lochgilphead competitions galore","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

And socially it#s been good for them,# he said.#Both first and second teams are in challenging leagues, but it#s a good challenge.

Retailers in Scotland have invested tens of millions of pounds on safety measures including plexiglass screens, queue management systems, social distancing signage and floor markings, better ventilation, cleaning and hygiene. Shop workers have ensured the nation was supplied and fed throughout the past  dficult months.The reopening of non-essential shops and ability of food-to-go retailers to resume welcoming customers in-store will mark a crucial milestone for Scottish retail and the wider supply chain. Retail is Scotland’s largest private sector employer. So-called non-essential stores have been compelled to close in Scotland for  consecutive days. The SRC and Usdaw encourage shoppers to:Across Scotland, thousands of shops which have been shuttered for four long months are looking forward to getting back to doing what they do best, serving their customers.Re-opening is good news for our economy, for jobs and for our local communities. It has never been more important to play our part in keeping our towns, cities and retail destinations vibrant.Every purchase from a shop helps to support jobs in local retail and throughout the supply chain.Retailers and their colleagues continue to work around the clock to maintain a safe shopping experience, so customers can have the confidence toto their favourite stores.If we all follow the necessary physical distancing and hygiene measures and show consideration to those around us, including shop staff who are doing a dficult job, then everyone will be better off.David Lonsdale, director of the Scottish Retail ConsortiumThe reopening of stores on Monday offers a leline for many retailers. That is good news in terms of helping to safeguard jobs, but the virus is still out there.We expect employers to conduct full risk assessments, follow the agreed guidance and ensure that customers are fully informed of the necessary safety measures.Shoppers need to play their part in helping to limit the spread of the virus and avoid further lockdowns by following the rules and respecting staff.Regrettably, throughout this appalling pandemic, incidents of abuse towards shop workers doubled and Covid safety measures have now become signicant flashpoints.Abuse should never be part of the job and shop workers – who played a vital role in getting food and medicine into our homes during the pandemic – deserve our thanks and respect.In January, the Scottish Parliament unanimously voted for a ground-breaking new law to protect shop workers.Usdaw campaigned for many years to secure these legal protections and we will continue to work hard to ensure that shop workers are protected and treated with the respect they deserve.Tracey Gilbert, Usdaw deputy isional officer for ScotlandSir,Oxfam’s shops in Argyll and Bute have an urgent need for volunteers to help deal with an anticipated deluge of donations as they prepare to re-open from Monday April .Sales from the first day of trading following the re-opening of its English and Welsh shops were up  per cent on  figures, with it being the most successful Monday ever sales-wise for the organisation outwith Christmas periods.Money raised by the dedicated staff and volunteers in Oxfam#s shops in Dunoon and Rothesay helps fight poverty and injustice around the world providing people with lesaving essentials like clean water and soap as well as the hope of a better future.We know from the last lockdown that people will have taken the chance to have a good declutter and we’re anticipating a deluge of generous donations.Volunteers are asked to give as little as a few hours a week of their time and can take up a range of vital roles, from serving customers to sorting donations and arranging window displays.Each shop typically relies on a team of  dedicated volunteers and one or two staff, with more than , volunteers required across the country.As well as volunteers, Oxfam stores are also appealing for good quality donations.Protecting staff, volunteers and customers from Covid- remains Oxfam’s priority, with shop teams continuing to implement strict protocol, including social distancing, readily available hand sanitiser, masks and gloves for staff, screens at tills, regular and frequent cleaning, closed changing rooms and encouraging contactless payment.In advance of shops re-opening, people are invited to register their interest online via www.oxfam.org.uk # just click on #get involved#.Tom Richardson, Oxfam interim head of retailSir,The demands placed on Scotland’s health service by the pandemic have intensied pleas for an increase in funding for Scottish NHS.NHS funding in Scotland comes from the block grant from Westminster. If huge sums of Scottish taxpayers’ money were not being used to pay Scotland’s share of renewing and maintaining Britain’s nuclear submarine fleet, there would be funds available to properly support the Scottish NHS. This will only be possible when Scotland is independent once more.Susan Swain, Dunbar"},{"url":null,"title":"self help bike workshop opens in tayvallich","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Our pretty Highlander girls have lost all interest in us now that the grass and rashes are a vivid, succulent green. They graze far and wide, ignoring their hay ring breakfast bar where they jostled and queued all winter.The sheep roam around the cattle’s hairy feet, no longer mooching for scraps from their breakfast table. So, it’s an easier morning round for us crofters with only the daft pigs to feed, who long ago foraged every root, acorn and pine-cone from their sizeable woodland.Their little forest is perfectly, porcinely ploughed, but they must still be finding some nourishment there as they seem less frantic at feeding-time, pausing their grubbling and guzzling for the occasional scratch and cuddle.The let-up in winter feeding has allowed much-needed attention to be given to the now stuffed-full Polycrub where every speck of soil, every hanging beam has been usefully employed in the mission to feed the family entirely from its harvest.Raspberry canes, lemon, orange and cherry trees should keep rickets at bay, while the plethora of weird and wonderful ieties of carrots, potatoes, asparagus, and squashes will nourish us throughout the season and beyond.Our newbie attempts to live off the land mirror the much more experienced efforts of families throughout theand breadth of this peninsula and in the village beyond. Thanks to those techie neighbours who set up email networks and social media groups there is a fantastic bank of information and expertise shared locally.Whether you want to learn how to plant oak trees, acquire foraging skills or find out how to run your home on renewable energy, somebody local has been there, done it and is happy to point you in the right direction.Over the last few months this valuable mine of knowledge and enthusiasm for environmental projects has been formalised into the Tayvallich Sustainability Plan, a  for sharing information and taking action to create a more sustainable community.The plan has grown organically from a pilot scheme run through the winter months with Keep Scotland Beautul to a website, action plan and monthly activities.Open to everyone with an interest in achieving a healthy, sustainable future for the village and its surroundings, the plan will work on the whole gambit: from food growing to flood mitigation foraging to forestry and heat pumps to bike pumps # a new cycle repair work-stand has been installed outside the village shop.Joining the online meetings throughout the winter, I was amazed to see not just the number of locals involved, but also the extraordinary talents and interests they share.We only entrenched ourselves full time on this wild wee bit of Argyll a month or two before lockdown so we’re not well-kent faces and, likewise, the faces of many villagers I’ve only ever seen strangely pixellated thanks to my dodgy connection to the Zoom meetings.Hopefully the same is true for wi throughout the area and that my, now ubiquitous, Zoom-accompanying glass of wine has stayed safely out of shot."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column april 30 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Most notably, throughout the pandemic, I have been supporting constituents and businesses with COVID- related matters such as sourcing financial help and dealing with concerns over vaccinations.I have delivered real results for the Borders. I campaigned for the poundm Borderlands funding for a Bordersrsquo Railway extension feasibility study, supported the successful re-instatement of Reston station and called for a fund to fix the crumbling roads. On the rural front, I put pressure on the SNP Government for more funding for agriculture and pushed for more resources to tackle rural crime and fly-tipping.As the Shadow Cabinet Secretary for Social Security and Older People, I worked with the Scottish Conservative strategy team, to formulate new policies to support older people and matters relating to Social Security Portfolio, such as narrowing the disability employment gap and improving digital inclusion.Looking ahead to the election I will campaign hard for local issues. When it comes to our fantastic NHS, I want a focus on reducing waiting times, improving mental health services and protecting local GP surgeries.As we emerge from the COVID pandemic, we must attract high quality, well-paid jobs to the Borders and improve infrastructure and digital connectivity to bolster the rural economy.On education, I support a national tutoring programme to help pupils catch up, more rural teachers and free school breakfasts and lunches to all primary school children.My campaign, alongside Doddie Weir OBE, continues on automatic access for people living with MND to receive a Blue Badge.

Now, we need to put recovery from the pandemic first. From supporting tourism and local business to tackling the climate emergency, delivering a better education system, supporting the NHS, bettering mental health provision, and making the case for a truly federal UK, I will always stand up for the disadvantaged and will make fairness and tackling inequality central to everything I want to achieve. I want to remove the barriers to opportunity which face rural areas more than others. Everyone should have the chance of living the le they want and to be as successful as possible. During the last year the curtains have been pulled back on where the help is most needed and we need to have a needle sharp focus on getting help to all those in that position.

Indeed, I spent years at an Edinburgh healthcare technology company, collaborating with universities and NHS Scotland on articial intelligence software for cancer screening and diagnosis of stroke.Throughout this pandemic we have seen the power of our countryrsquos science base. Despite bumps in the road, the roll-out of testing and multiple vaccines has been impressive.But the pandemic tells another story too ndash of warnings ignored and preparations left unmade. We could and should have had a better plan for one of the highest-ranked known public health risks. We must learn from this collective failure.Scientists have warned for decades that the world is heading towards climate breakdown. They also now speak of a ldquonature emergency ndash an era of mass extinctions caused by humans. Yet greenhouse gas levels in the atmosphere relentlessly rise and our forests and oceans continue in dangerous decline. Nowadays, I see scientists practically weeping as they watch this unravelling accelerate, with no believable action plan from politicians.The Scottish Greens recognise that technology will play a huge part in stepping us back from the brink. Our co-leader Lorna Slater is a renewable energy engineer, and our proposed poundbn Green Recovery investment programme will fund thousands of high-quality, unionised Scottish jobs in renewables. But letrsquos not kid ourselves. Itrsquos mostly not technology we lack, itrsquos political will.The Greens will invest massively in warm homes ndash upgrading insulation and converting to low-carbon heating systems. We have bold plans to improve rail, bus and active travel, and already won free bus travel for under-s from this summer. Finally, we propose an urgent programme to repair nature, dramatically accelerating the positive steps already taken by rural businesses, workers and charities.These solutions are not high-tech, not ldquosexy and may not generate huge profits for international investors and a rich elite.

He has lived in the Scottish Borders for  years.Vanguard Party champions the Union and Brexit. The UK, four nations in union, will prosper as an independent country, outwith the EU. If Scotland were to leave the Union and join the EU, it would not be an independent country. It would be a rule-taker from Brussels. There would be a hard border with the rest of the UK. Scottish exports to the rest of the UK are currently worth three times those to the EU. Funding via the Barnett formula would end. Scots would lose British citizenship.Vanguard Party believes Scotlands future should be decided by the people, not the courts. However, independence is not practical without the support of a simple majorityof the registered electorate, not merely a simple majority of valid votes. IndyRef must require a simple majority of the registered electorate of the whole of Scotland, for the whole of Scotland to leave. In  only  per cent of the registered electorate of the whole of Scotland voted for independence.Vanguard Party will preserve the distinction between sex and gender. It will protect womens rights to same-sex spaces. It will oppose self-identication. It will oppose any denial of biological truth.Vanguard Party will champion children of disadvantaged backgrounds by providing help and support to raise attainment. It will not promote quotas and targets that may excuse lower attainment.Vanguard Party will champion the NHS. It will recognise the true worth of all NHS staff. It will tackle hospital waiting lists and support GPs to resume face-to-face appointments for all.Vanguard Party will abolish hate crime including incitement of hatred in peoples minds.

Most important was keeping in touch with you through my surgeries: in supermarkets, libraries, and my annual summer surgery tour through the villages. This past year of course has changed everything. We have all been stuck at home keeping in touch through emails. COVID has dominated and I have tried to help you with the problems it brought in its wake. Moving now through vaccination, queries arise as you await that appointment. At the same time other issues continue: unsuitable housing, planning concerns. This is the essential work and duty of an MSP to constituents no matter what their politics. I hope I have discharged that duty. I have also chaired the parliamentrsquos cross-party group on animal welfare for many years with two Bills to my name: The Control of DogsAct , now law, putting the blame on the owner not the dog and The Welfare of DogsBill which aims to end casual purchase of puppies. COVID prevented it proceeding butelected I intend to bring it back, especially with concern that some of those \"COVID\" puppies will end up in animal rescue centres. Yes, how le has changed, COVID has been hard: losing a business built over years, living with children trapped in a flat, not attending a funeral, delaying the wedding, the new baby not socialising with family. The list is endless of the sacrices, the losses. COVID has broken the link with the way we were, just as those World Wars changed society. Nicola Sturgeon has demonstrated true leadership and moving to recovery it must not be back to the same old, same old but to a socially just society, valuing people from cradle to grave, our public services, rejoining the EU as an independent nation. On May , I ask for your constituency vote on my record as your MSP and the list vote for the SNP, giving you and Scotland a democratic choice to move forward as a renewed nation.Shona Haslam Shona Haslam, Scottish ConservativesOn Thursday, May , voters are faced with a choice. Rebuild our communities after the pandemic by improving our childrenrsquos education, delivering record funding to our NHS and enhancing employment opportunities, or, once again, reopen the question of Scotlandrsquos place within the United Kingdom.Make no mistake: the next few weeks will see one of the most important elections of our letime.Nicola Sturgeon has demonstrated recently that she only cares about one thing, an independence referendum that most Scots do not want but one that she will still foist upon them anyway. The past year has been tough for us all. Many of us have struggled with the pressures of lockdown, myself included. But the way to recover from this pandemic is not to launch into another constitutional argument that threatens our livelihoods, our childrenrsquos futures and our way of le.As a mum to two lovely boys, I want to see a government that puts aside its own agenda and commits to focusing on whatrsquos best for the next generation of Scots. ldquoJudge me on my record said Nicola Sturgeon on education. Well, the attainment gap remains as large as it ever was, and Scotlandrsquos education system has plummeted in international rankings. It would seem the First Minister has been found wanting.Itrsquos not just our schools that under threat other public services are too. As leader of the Scottish Borders Council, I have fought tirelessly against repeated cuts to our budget, forcing councillors to make dficult choices simply because the Scottish Government finds it easier to pass the buck. After the strain of COVID, we need a Scottish Government that will step up, empower councils and work with them, not against them.Butthe SNP gain enough seats to form a majority in May then all that is at risk. Once again, they will push for another isive referendum.There is only one way to stop that: lend me your constituency vote, and the Scottish Conservatives your party vote, on May .ACMay AC May, Scottish Liberal DemocratsI intend to represent you the only way I know how - by working tirelessly with a keen eye on the future to ensure that there is investment and improvement in education, employment opportunities and business growth. I will stand up for better funded healthcare and demand that money is directed towards care homes, mental health and wellbeing to bring these up to the standards we all deserve. To do this will need a strong economy and the Scottish Liberal Democrats are putting recovery first ndash this must be Scotlandrsquos priority. A vote for me is a vote of confidence for a more secure future for you and your families.Its time for a change. The area needs someone who will heed the concerns of constituents, and voice these strongly in parliament, not just another person sitting in Holyrood applauding every word of the First Minister.Prior to the boundary changes, the Scottish Liberal Democrats had a long record of success here, and its high-time for ato rational, clear thinking on the issues that matter locally and nationally.Our high streets and town centres ndash the beating heart of our communities ndash need urgent help. This was apparent before the pandemic, but even more so now. Online commerce can bring tremendous benefits and is here to stay. Many businesses have transformed to the new normal, but many others have struggled. We need to focus on how growing online spend can coexist with a vibrant local economy, and work to restore community feeling.Im looking forward to getting stuck into the campaign. By their own admission, a ided Tory party has mishandled Brexit, driving Scottish voters in desperation towards nationalism, while the opportunist and populist SNP seeks to compound the disaster of Brexit by withdrawing from the UK completely, just at the point when we need economic recovery the most.A vote for me is a vote for progress through strong partnerships within Scotland, across the UK and with our European neighbours, so that together we can recover from the COVID crisis and move beyond the politics of ision.Katherine Sangster Katherine Sangster, Scottish LabourCOVID-rsquos impact on our families, our communities and our economy has been profound. We now need to start the hard work of rebuilding our country and that task needs new faces, fresh ideas and experience outside of Holyrood.I am a working parent who prior to  had never been involved in politics. However, I like many other parents soon realised that the SNPrsquos childcare policies sound good on the back of an election leaflet but donrsquot work in practice. So, in , I campaigned for fairer access to childcare and led Fair Funding for our Kids - a nationwide campaign that got childcare on to the national agenda, building a movement of mums that demanded action from Government. Our campaign secured more funded childcare from Government - a step towards equality, but there is still plenty to be done.Soon, I was speaking on television, writing for newspapers and lobbying politicians. All things I has never done before but I was speaking from the heart and articulating mine and othersrsquo experience. Now with five years plus experience in politics I still firmly believe that policy is best made by those with lived experience and the job of a politician is to listen and advocate on peoples behalf, and I will always put that at the heart of what I do.Working for an MP now, every day I support people with the issues that blight their lives from poor housing to an inhumane benefits system to bins not getting picked up. These are issues that affect people day in day out. Chatting to voters and speaking to constituents, I have experienced no appetite for debate on a second referendum just a desire from people that we as politicians and aspiring politicians listen to their concerns and respond to those concerns.We need to elect MSPs to Holyrood who understand these concerns and will fully use the powers of the Scottish Parliament to make peoplersquos lives better. Holyrood is one of the most powerful devolved parliaments in the world lets start using those powers. As Donald Dewar said at the opening of the Scottish Parliament in  ldquoA Scottish Parliament, not an end but a means to greater ends.On May  please use your vote carefully and letrsquos start the task of uniting our country behind our national recovery."},{"url":null,"title":"mcdonalds-bank-holiday-offers-big-mac-mcchicken-sandwich","story":"Have you enjoyedthe Bank Holiday weekend a bit too

out of a second lockdown is madness.But local business owners Della Murray and Artur Budenko say it is a leap of faith they are willing to make after taking over the reins of Ramblers Cafeacute in Peebles.The couple, who run a small take-out nestled on Peebles High Street, have been serving the Peeblesshire community throughout the coronavirus pandemic, even going as far as using a taxi

They reported the finding to the RSPCA.As well as real specimens, researchers used simulations to help understand how dferent seals propel themselves through the water.Lead author David Hocking, of Monash University, teamed up with engineer Dr Shibo Wang, from the universityrsquos department of mechanical and aerospace engineering, to use simulations to show how water flows around seal flippers of dferent shapes.Dr Hocking said: ldquoOur analysis showed that some Antarctic seals, like leopard seals, actually have very streamlined, wing-like forelimbs, despite being from the lsquofoot-propelledrsquo seal family.The discovery shows how wing-like flippers can evolve in seals that already swim with their back feet, providing a pathway for the evolution of forelimb swimming in the fur seals and sea lions.Dr Park added: ldquoWe found that grey seals still use their paws to hold their prey when processing it, but other seals like leopard seals have forgone this ability to maximise their swimming speed and agility, being able to capture more mobile prey.Researchers said that as well as explaining the origin of seals, this study may also improve human design.Dr Hocking said: ldquoSeals have had millions of years to perfect their swimming, and they can teach us a thing or two about underwater grace and elegance.ldquoLearning from them may help us to improve the design of human-built machines like underwater drones and submersibles, increasing their speed, manoeuvrability or energy efficiency.rsquondash The study is published in Current Biology..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Engineers and biologists join forces to reveal how seals evolved to swim"},{"url":null,"title":"leader april 16 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

And now, more than a week later and despite updates in the interim about the reopening of schools, they#re still waiting – and it#s not acceptable.Like everyone , islanders are desperate to know when they can reconnect with family and friends. Island businesses are equally frantic to know when and how they can make plans for the weeks ahead.But, unlike everyone , our islands are at a complete disadvantage. They still don#t know what is happening, or when. They deserve better. The Scottish Government needs to respond to our islands# call for clarity and let them, like the rest of the country, start to think and plan ahead.Now in its nd year, the Big Garden Birdwatch is a chance for people of all ages to count the number of birds that visit their garden helping the Royal Society for the Protection of Birdsto build up a picture of how they are doing.This year, more than a million people across the UK, including more than , in Scotland, took part, counting  million birds.The event, held over the last weekend in January, revealed the house sparrow held on to its number one spot.

Goldfinches saw the greatest decline in Scotland’s top , falling four places from sixth position last year, with reported numbers  per cent fewer than .I am absolutely delighted with the number of people who have taken part, making it the biggest year ever for RSPB Scotland.This has generated a massive amount of data which will help our scientists with important conservation work, but it also shows how many of us have turned to nature after what has been a dficult  months.We need every voice raised to stand up for nature. The wildle that brings us so much interest and solace is now just a fraction of what should be there.Big Garden Birdwatch has shown that people across Scotland have a real passion for their wildle.

There are lots of brilliant causes worth supporting butever there was one the whole community could get behind, it is surely this.Let#s make play inclusive in Campbeltown."},{"url":null,"title":"letters april 23 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Retailers in Scotland have invested tens of millions of pounds on safety measures including plexiglass screens, queue management systems, social distancing signage and floor markings, better ventilation, cleaning and hygiene. Shop workers have ensured the nation was supplied and fed throughout the past thirteen dficult months.The reopening of non-essential shops and ability of food-to-go retailers to resume welcoming customers in-store will mark a crucial milestone for Scottish retail and the wider supply chain. Retail is Scotland#s largest private sector employer. So-called non-essential stores have been compelled to close in Scotland for  consecutive days.The SRC and Usdaw encourage shoppers to:Across Scotland, thousands of shops which have been shuttered for four long months are looking forward to getting back to doing what they do best — serving their customers.Reopening is good news for our economy, for jobs and for our local communities. It has never been more important to play our part in keeping our towns, cities and retail destinations vibrant.Every purchase from a shop helps support jobs in local retail and throughout the supply chain. Retailers and their colleagues continue to work around the clock to maintain a safe shopping experience, so customers can have the confidence toto their favourite stores.If we all follow the necessary physical distancing and hygiene measures and show consideration to those around us, including shop staff who are doing a dficult job, then everyone will be better off.The reopening of stores on Monday offers a leline for many retailers. That is good news in terms of helping to safeguard jobs, but the virus is still out there.We expect employers to conduct full risk assessments, follow the agreed guidance and ensure that customers are fully informed of the necessary safety measures.Shoppers need to play their part in helping to limit the spread of the virus and avoid further lockdowns by following the rules and respecting staff.Regrettably, throughout this appalling pandemic, incidents of abuse towards shop workers doubled and Covid safety measures have now become signicant flashpoints. Abuse should never be part of the job and shop workers – who played a vital role in getting food and medicine into our homes during the pandemic – deserve our thanks and respect.In January, the Scottish Parliament unanimously voted for a ground-breaking new law to protect shop workers. Usdaw campaigned for many years to secure these legal protections and we will continue to work hard to ensure that shop workers are protected and treated with the respect they deserve.The national charity for older people is encouraging people to get moving every day next month as part of a new fundraising activity challenge.Throughout May, Age Scotland is asking people across the country to Spring into Action to help support older people in Scotland.Fundraisers can take part however they choose, but the most important thing is to make sure they are active every day.All funds raised by Spring into Action participants will go towards Age Scotland#s vital services, including the national friendship line, which offers a place older people can turn tothey are in need of support, comfort and reassurance or even just missing a friendly voice.Running and walking events have always been a great way to help raise vital funds and, even with many regular events unfortunately cancelled over the past year, we#ve been overwhelmed by the kindness and generosity shown by fundraisers still going above and beyond.We hope to see as many people as possible taking up our challenge to Spring into Action this May. With nights getting lighter and better weather on the horizon, this is a great excuse to get out and about and support a worthy cause at the same time.#Whether you run one mile, walk five, or design your own challenge, your fundraising efforts will be making a real dference for older people in Scotland.#The money you raise will fund vital services like our friendship line.

Online records showed his birthplace as #Inchial Argileshire#, which turned out to be the parish of Glenorchy and Inishail at the head of Loch Awe.Alexander McNab was born there to Alexander senior and Margaret McNab in  — one of a family of three brothers and four sisters — and moved south to Burnley in Lancashire in the s. In Lancashire in , he married Janet Wardrope, who came from Milngavie outside Glasgow, and they went on to have  children.Going back a few generations, Clare#s research has traced Alexander#s great grandfather, John McNab, born in Kilbrandon in the area around Loch Melfort in .His son Peter, born around , went on to farm in Connel and is recorded in the  census as an -year-old, farming  acres at South Ledaig, though is described as a #smith# in an earlier record.Born in , Peter#s son Alexander grew up to work in farming around Glenorchy. In the  census he is recorded as a ploughman at Barbreck.#Our# Alexander seems to have been a blacksmith when he moved from Argyll to Burnley to start a new le.Sadly, two of Alexander and Janet#s family died as young children.Later, however, they found themselves — like so many other families — caught up in the horrors of the First World War.They lost three sons — Andrew, aged , missing in action,  Alex, , missing in action,  and John, , missing in action,  — during the war.The grief the family must have borne is unimaginable. The boys# names are recorded on three separate First World War memorials in Belgium and France.Clare said: #What a tragedy losing your sons. Andrew, Alex and John were brothers of my great grandma, Grace McNab Bridge.#Alexander died in  at the age of , after being hit by a tramcar in Blackpool during the blackout. He was living with daughter Grace and her family at the time. A short newspaper report from the time describes him as a #retired blacksmith#.Clare was born in Blackpool and moved to Tees-side, via a spell in Dumfries, through her husband David#s employment.Though her great grandmother Grace passed away in , Clare believes she can detect echoes of the past in her own family today.She explained: #My son, who is in army, has just trained in music and learnt the bagpipes.#Little bits keep popping up. My other son is into blacksmithing, which is also in the family.#And while she has never visited Argyll, Clare would love to at some point once Covid restrictions have eased.#I had a look at images of Loch Awe and have been reading up about the area.

A big decision has been swept under the carpet.#The budget was reduced by £,, from £, to £,.Douglas Hendry, executive director of customer services, said: #Our process is not to fund routes where there is alternative transport available or where there are less than , people travelling annually.#TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AGOPiper#s march wins prizeThe Campbeltown piper who won a competition to compose a tune to mark a battle in which many of his comrades fought was presented with his prize on Tuesday # the battle#s rd anniversary.Mr George McIntyre from Meadowburn won a competition run by the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders to compose a   march in memory of the Battle of Longstop Hill in .On Tuesday, Longstop Day, Major Hamish Clarkof the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders travelled to Campbeltown to present George with a specially engraved quaich at a ceremony at the Argyll Hotel.Many Kintyre men fought at the battle which was one of the decisive moments in the Second World War against the Germans in North Africa.Major Duncan McMillan, who won the Military Medal at the battle, attended the ceremony along with many of George#s other old army friends.Before he handed the quaich to George, Major Clark said: #I really can#t think of anyone more appropriate to have won the competition than George McIntyre himself.#If George had not been taken prisoner in  he may well have fought at Longstop.#Receiving the quaich, George said: #It gives me great honour to achieve this.#Then Mr Ian McKerral from Kintyre and District Pipe Band gave the first public performance of the tune.FIFTY YEARS AGOThe end of the road for PaulPaul McCartney, who is at the moment staying at High Park Farm, Campbeltown, has just made one giant step forward towards severing all his connections with the other three Beatles.John Lennon, George Harrison and Ringo Starr abandoned their appeal against a High Court order on Monday, putting the affairs of their company, Apple, in the hands of a receiver. The three now face a legal costs bill estimated at £,.Mr Morris Finer, QC for John, George, Ringo and Apple, told the appeal court on Monday that they now considered it was in the common interest to explore ways of allowing Paul to free himself from the partnership by agreement.Mr David Hurst QC on behalf of Paul said: #He will most willingly enter into the proposed negotiations to achieve his freedom from the partnership by consent rather than by court action.#Well, it looks very much like the end of the #long and winding road# to quote a well known McCartney ballad.What does Paul himself feel about the rise and fall of the Beatles Two Courier men drove up to High Park Farm — which has a long and decidedly bumpy road leading to it — to find out what the man in the centre of it all felt about things.Apart from being obviously excited about his latest and most important success, Paul did not like saying anything about the matter.Though very polite and friendly, he made it quite clear that he does not see any point in giving interviews or saying anything remotely sensational.After ten years of being harried and hustled by journalists and photographers never having a minute#s peace to himself always having been the centre of attraction never having been able to pop in to the #local#, is it any wonder that Paul is determined to live as quietly as possible He seemed as happy as a sand-boy, out there in the wilds.When we approached him, he had obviously been brushing down one of his horses because he still held a horse brush in his hand.His we Linda looked the essence of happiness as her golden hair mirrored the warm sunshine. The children yelled and gurgled contentedly and even Martha, the English sheepdog, seemed happy.The farm house itself has been extensively renovated, a new roof having been constructed and the farm work appears to be progressing normally.Paul himself has changed. Outwardly at any rate. Gone is the Beatle mop, the style which was copied the whole word over. Gone is the boyish grin, which once sent screaming thousands into ecstasy.What has taken the place of these characteristics  Paul now sports a beard the hair remains longish but it is brushed back, revealing the full extent of his forehead the smile is no longer boyish.The former bass-guitarist song-writer with the most influential and certainly most famous foursome the world has ever known has changed.Paul will probably continue to compose such brilliant songs as Maybe I#m Amazed and Another Day but to millions of people, from Campbeltown to Honolulu, pop music will certainly never be the same again.ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOSparks and flashesThere would be some fluttering this week among the ladies in the town who are liable to serve on a jury, summonses to appear on the occasion of a forthcoming jury trial having been issued to  ladies and  gentlemen.

Eight designs will be chosen to become stamps which will be on sale across the UK.Children may choose to illustrate frontline workers in health or social care.They may want to celebrate other key workers who have kept the country going, such as refuse collectors, cleaners, teachers, supermarket workers, public transport staff, delivery drivers or, indeed, postmen and postwomen.Or they might highlight the volunteers who have helped in their local communities or raised money for charity, such as the late Captain Sir Tom Moore.The competition is open until Friday May . A special  of judges will select the winners. As with all special stamps, the final eight designs will be sent to HM The Queen before they can be printed and issued as stamps. The winners will be announced in the autumn.We cannot wait to see who children choose to honour on their stamp.

If you are taking a long-term view then a garden full of reliable flowering shrubs is also an option.Whatever garden you have, watering and weeding are the key watchwords for May. It is essential to water newly planted fruit trees, roses and shrubs regularly to help their root systems get established.It is also the time of year when many plants# demand for water increases as they start their major growth period. Top watering tips include – every time you plant something, water it in well, make a moat of soil round newly planted plants so that water doesn#t run off and goes to the roots, water pots and containers so that water appears right to the top of the pot and get a water butt.If you have a drainpipe, you have a natural water supply so a simple garden solution for May is to ensure that you have adequate water storage. If you buy and fit a water butt, it will provide you with water for the garden in an environmentally friendly way and on a regular basis.Annual weeds will be popping up now, so weeding borders once a week to prevent weed seedlings establishing is a good idea. The problem with the most common weeds such as nettles, dandelions and bindweed, is that they are very, very tough. They can continue to grow in conditions that make most garden plants simply fade away – and they do that, in part, by using the moisture, nutrients and light of the plants around them.A great plant to get you into the summer gardening spirit is the pretty petunia – perfect for containers and hanging baskets and a great choice for instant colour. It can flower all summer long, providing you deadhead regularly, and comes in a iety of colours to suit any garden palette.Petunias are also available in dferent blooms including single, double, ruffled or smooth petals. They can be striped, veined or solid in colour and most sold today are hybrids developed for specic design purposes such as fragrance.They need full sun and can#t tolerate frost but can grow in a wide range of soils and thrive in multipurpose compost when planted in containers.Keeping on top of garden maintenance is crucial in May. The garden is coming alive so there is plenty to keep you busy. Here are some jobs you should be thinking about this month from the Royal Horticultural Society:"},{"url":null,"title":"liveargylls leisure facilities and libraries reopen","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Community benefit and shared ownership must, they say, be made a requirement of all future wind farm projects.They also believe residents are at a disadvantage when dealing with complex, jargon-filled planning proposals, and called for the Scottish Government to enforce better community engagement and provide funding towards professional advice for community councils affected by larger developments falling under section  and  of of the Electricity Act .The government must explore alternative arrangements, added the group, for the re-opening of the Machrihanish wind turbine factory.The height and number of turbines is of increasing concern, with recent applications proposing towers up to  metres high # some  per cent taller than many existing structures.The group believes the cumulative effect will negatively impact the area#s scenic beauty and therefore tourism.Bob Chicken, planning convenor for Tarbert and Skipness Community Council, said: #Our communities# needs are being ignored. We believe that our proposals will strike a fairer balance between the need for greener power and the needs of the remote and rural populations who live and work in the lands used to generate it.#The group#s specic concerns were put to renewable energy industry body Scottish Renewables.Claire Mack, chief executive of Scottish Renewables, replied by saying that rural Scotland had a #central role# to play in delivering clean power for climate change targets.She continued: #The latest UK Government figures show that only  per cent of Scots are opposed to the development of onshore wind farms. That data is supported by further research, carried out specically in rural Scotland, which additionally showed higher support for onshore wind power among young people.#Renewables now provide the equivalent of  per cent of Scotland’s electricity consumption, with onshore wind delivering the bulk of that power, employing , people across the country and supporting a thriving supply chain of businesses from the central belt to the Borders, Highlands and Islands.#"},{"url":null,"title":"sun shines for delayed but welcomed opening of bowling greens","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Still unable to control his weeping, he began to crawl backwards. Izzy opened the door and cradled him as he crumpled onto the floor in the corridor outside the room.Izzy glanced quickly inside, checking Finn was still asleep. He moved for a moment, then turned over. She slowly and carefully closed the door and sat down with Ewen, putting her arms around him.She had no words, but knew words were not what was needed. She just held him in a hug as he wept his soul out.A fellow guest walked by on the way to the showers. He paused for a moment with a towel hanging over his right shoulder.ldquoYou all right  he asked.ldquoMy friend has just had some bad news, said Izzy.ldquoOK, yeah, I can see that, hope it works out, he said awkwardly and headed for the showers.Finally, Ewen began to compose himself and appeared from behind his hands, his face a sodden mess. Izzy took her arms away, gave him a sympathetic look and stood up.ldquoLetrsquos find a place we can sit and talk, she said.Ewen nodded and pulled himself up off the floor with Izzyrsquos help. When they entered the kitchen area, everyone instinctively moved away and left them alone. Ewen sat at a table and Izzy put the kettle on.Then she came and sat next to him, putting a supportive hand on his left arm. They both sat, not speaking. Ewen finally stopped crying and Izzy got up and brought some paper kitchen towels so he could wipe his face, then went to make tea for them both. She ed with two steaming mugs and sat by him again, still not speaking, just being there for him, her best friend.He stared at the mug of tea, lted it to his lips, then spoke before he drank.ldquoI hardly recognised him, he said.He took a gulp of tea and looked up at Izzy.His voice began to break as he tried to explain: ldquoItrsquos been four years since I saw him ndash last time was just before his eighth birthday. Hersquos changed so much. But then I heard his breathing as he slept, thatrsquos the same, I recognised that.He drank some more tea, took in a deep breath, then exhaled loudly with a sigh.ldquoHe used to fall asleep after Irsquod told him a story and I would stay for a while and listen to him breathe.He could feel tears welling up again. ldquoSorry Izzy, I canrsquot help it, so embarrassing.Tears streamed down his cheeks again and he lowered his head.Izzy walked to the sink, tore some more kitchen towels from the rack and gave them to him. She sat by him.ldquoI canrsquot imagine what it feels like, Ewen, all those years of pent-up emotion missing your son, there is no need to apologise. I should have realised how hard that would be for you. It was my mistake.Ewen looked up. ldquoGod no, Izzy, thanks to you Irsquove seen Finn, close up, in the moonlight and sleeping. I was able to whisper to him under my breath that I loved him, just before I lost it and made that scene.Izzy looked round the empty kitchen.ldquoI think everyone in here thinks wersquore a couple whorsquove fallen out, she said. ldquoIrsquom a bit concerned that people will talk about it tomorrow morning and Finn could overhear. I think, to be on the safe side, we will leave as soon as possible and have breakfast by the loch. At least then you will get to see him in the morning in the way wersquove arranged.ldquoYeah, thatrsquod be great. Irsquove pitched the tent in the hidden spot in the trees, Irsquoll keep an ear out for you arriving.Ewen realised he was hungry.ldquoYou havenrsquot got something to eat, have you  he asked. ldquoIrsquove not eaten since lunchtime just not been hungry, till now.Izzy gave him a packet of crisps: ldquoSorry thatrsquos all I have to hand.ldquoNo, thatrsquos perfect, thanks, I just need a snack. Irsquoll cook something by the loch later.He opened the packet, then scrunched the crisps into small bits. Izzy watched as he tipped them into his mouth and carefully folded the empty packet into a small square.ldquoFinn does exactly that when he eats crisps, she said.ldquoWersquod have a competition, explained Ewen, ldquoto see who could fold the packet into the smallest square. It was just one of the things we used to do. I dunno how we started it. I think the idea is you canrsquot fold anything more than seven times, so we would try to.ldquoWell, he still does it.Ewen smiled but it was a sad one. Izzy wasnrsquot sureshe was making things worse or better for him by telling him such things.ldquoDoes he like his boots  he asked.ldquoLoves them and they fit perfectly.Ewen nodded, then clenched his hands together on the table. Izzy could feel his pain. She placed her hands on top of his.ldquoEwen, you are doing amazing, this must be hell for you, I know how much you love Finn and want him to know it. But please, be careful. He could have seen you at the Falls of Leny, and he definitely saw you talking to me at Balquhidder. Hersquos seen your car. We have to be super careful to ensure he doesnrsquot recognise you or realise.Ewen nodded: ldquoSally comes up with a dferent hire car tomorrow, so that should make things less obvious. I think shersquos worried about me.ldquoMe too, you be OK tonight  asked Izzy.ldquoIrsquoll be OK. This evening, even though it was for a brief moment and he didnrsquot know it, I was with Finn. Irsquoll know hersquos near and will have a distant view of him in the morning. I feel closer to him than I have for four years, although itrsquos making me feel like a stalker.ldquoYoursquore not a stalker, Ewen, yoursquore a dad who loves his son.Ewen clenched his hands again. ldquoThank you.ldquoIrsquom doing it for Finn as much as for you, said Izzy. She was still sure she was doing the right thing, but was terried of the risks.ldquoPlease remember to be careful and stick to the plans we made, she pleaded. ldquoWe have to keep him safe. Hersquos been through enough already.ldquoI will, I promise.Ewen finished his tea and left the hostel.Izzy sat a while, trying to calm herself, eyes closed and breathing deeply.ldquoYou all right, honey She opened her eyes: it was a woman who had come into the kitchen. Izzy wanted to say yes but the womanrsquos concern and kind words triggered a flood of tears. It was her turn to be comforted, by a stranger who knew nothing of the burden she carried, of her guilt and overwhelming feeling of responsibility.ldquoThank you for being so kind, she said to the woman. ldquoI feel much better now after a wee greet.ldquoNo man is worth such upset, my lovely, the kind woman said. Izzy just nodded and smiled at her. If only it was that simple, she thought.She ed to the room and opened the door slowly Finn was sound asleep. Izzy felt emotionally exhausted and hoped shersquod fall asleep quickly, but as she lay in her bed after a hot shower, she couldnrsquot stop her mind racing it had been so close, whatFinn had woken  She trusted Ewen to be careful. But she must be careful too. Finally, under the gaze of MacFarlanersquos Lantern, sleep overtook her.Finn was first to wake in the morning.ldquoAunty, aunty, itrsquos morning! he said while looking out of the window. It was daylight but the sky had clouded over and thick mist hung on the hills.ldquoA typical Highland morning, he said cheerfully.Izzy got things packed as Finn had his shower and they left the hostel before most of the other residents were out of their beds. After a phone call to Finnrsquos mum, they set off.ldquoWhere we having breakfast  asked Finn.ldquoVery close by, on the banks of Loch Dochart.They drove for just a few minutes and pulled into a layby. Izzy performed her usual routine of bringing her rucksack. They walked through some woodland and arrived at the waterrsquos edge.ldquoWow, is that an island with a castle on it  asked Finn.ldquoIt is, said Izzy, ldquoand what stories are here! Irsquoll tell you some over breakfast.Finn helped Izzy set up her stove and they took turns stirring the porridge. There were midges in the air, at times annoying, but it was late in the season and their biting was minimal. A breeze from the loch kept them away most of the time.She told Finn of the castlersquos history, how the island was once a MacGregor stronghold, but that lsquoBlack Duncan Campbellrsquo built the castle they saw now after he took the land.Then Izzy told an ancient legend: ldquoIt was here that Fionn MacCoul met his death, at the hands of a giant named Taileachd.Finn scooped more porridge into his bowl but he nodded, showing he was listening and wanted Izzy to continue.ldquoThe giant lived with his sweetheart, who was a beautul faery maiden.ldquoOf course, said Finn, smiling cheekily.Izzy ed the smile and continued: ldquoSome versions of the tale say they had their home on an island on Loch Lubhair, just downstream, while others an island here on Loch Dochart, maybe even that one.Finn studied the castlersquos ruins, which peered out from the trees which covered the island. It looked so mysterious.ldquoOne day, Taileachd discovered that his sweetheart had met Fionn and they had fallen in love.ldquoSo Fionn ran off with her, thatrsquos ironic! laughed Finn.ldquoNo, you see she loved them both, maybe in dferent ways, but she was now torn between them. They were going to fight over her, and she knew one of them would be killed, so she came up with an idea.Finn put his bowl down and listened as Izzy acted out the tale.ldquolsquoPlease put your anger awayrsquo, said the faery woman. lsquoI love you both, but whoever can leap the furthest I shall be with.rsquoldquoA jumping competition! exclaimed Finn.ldquoExactly!Izzy dramatically described how the two competitors leapt from the island trying to outperform each other. They were equally matched but when they jumped backwards, Fionn momentarily lost his balance and the giant, fearful he was going to lose his sweetheart, took the opportunity to cut off Fionnrsquos head!ldquoAw, ouch, foul! cried Finn.Izzy nodded and spoke with a solemn tone.ldquoIn that moment of violence, they all lost everything. The faery woman fled: she no longer loved Taileachd because of his brutal act, and Fionn, whom she loved, had lost his le. His body floated down the river, and was found by the Fiann, his band of warriors. They buried him at Killin and now they were full of vengeance, so went to search for Fionnrsquos murderer.ldquoDid they find him ldquoWell, Taileachd fled to Rannoch Moor and Irsquoll tell you what happened when we get there, later today.ldquoAw, aunty!Finnrsquos protest was interrupted as his attention was suddenly caught by the sight of a man in a dinghy rowing out into the loch. They watched as he struggled a bit in the current, then vanished behind the eastern side of the island. A few minutes later, the man appeared on top of the ruined tower, half hidden by branches. He sat there.Finn waved and the man waved back.ldquoI really want to go onto that island and see the castle and where the giant lived. Maybe that man will lend us his dingy ldquoHersquos probably going fishing, Finn, and is just looking at the water to see where the fish are. Hersquoll be there all day.ldquoWe could swim ldquoThe current is too strong here Finn, but we could swim at out next stop: St Fillanrsquos healing pool, itrsquos part of the river, just upstream from here.Finn stood by the waterrsquos edge looking out to the island, disappointed. But he accepted his auntrsquos decision.They packed up and headed for the healing pool.

It seems very unfair that we should no longer be able to use a road that we pay for to access the hills.I noticed a picture on Facebook, taken on a sunny Sunday when people would normally be out enjoying a walk around the reservoir, but only one car seems to be using the car park.As East Lothian grows, we should be utilising as much of our outdoor space as possible to help our population exercise and take pressure off coastlines and popular woodland areas. The Lammermuir Hills are underused for recreation and have a superb network of paths, but woefully inadequate parking.Overriding everything in the letter you printed is the Scottish Governments Land Reform Act of , which clearly states the Right for Responsible Access in Scotland.. The overall framework of land rights, responsibilities and public policies should promote, fulfil and respect relevant human rights in relation to land, contribute to public interest and wellbeing, and balance public and private interests. The framework should support sustainable economic development, protect and enhance the environment, help achieve social justice and build a fairer society.. There should be a more erse pattern of land ownership and tenure, with more opportunities for citizens to own, lease and have access to land.The landownerrsquos decision to heavily restrict parking prejudices families, those with disabilities and groups who take people walking in the hills and need an access point. I understand that during the last year, the countryside has suffered littering, fires and irresponsible parking, but to punish responsible visitors because of the behaviour of a minority is a knee-jerk reaction and will only create animosity towards the estate at a time when public opinion is turning against grouse shooting. Instead, the landowner should be working with local residents, East Lothian Council and interested parties to help improve access and educate visitors on how to visit responsibly.Name and address supplied"},{"url":null,"title":"builders-merchant-built-instead-hotel-former-raceland-site","story":"The former Raceland karting site, between Gladsmuir and Longniddry, closed in early .Work is due to start later this year on a petrol station, two drive-thru restaurants and a drive-thru cafe on the southern section of the site.Initial proposals suggested a hotel could be built on the northern part of the former karting site, where the outdoor track was located, but that could now be ditched for a buildersrsquo merchants.The karting centre was given planning permission in  and also operated a paintball centre. However, the business closed three years ago and Monte Blackburn Ltd bought the site.Now, the Blackburn-based owners want a buildersrsquo merchant to be based there, with MKM Building Supplies, which previously planned to move to Gateside in Haddington before opting against the switch ldquodue to the perceived impact on the surrounding residential area, earmarked as the occupier.A childrenrsquos nursery and care home could now be built on the Haddington Gateside site, with a planning application being weighed up by East Lothian Council.The developer behind the proposed buildersrsquo merchants acknowledged that there had been ldquoa long-standing requirement for a site in East Lothian for several years.A search of Tranent, Macmerry and Haddington was undertaken in a bid to find a suitable site for the business.An application for the Gladsmuir site is now with East Lothian Councilrsquos planning department.A planning statement which was included within the application said: ldquoPlanning permission is sought for the erection of a building for use as a buildersrsquo merchants.ldquoIf planning permission is granted, the end occupier will be MKM Building Supplies, a national company with approximately  stores throughout the UK.ldquoMKM Building Supplies is a Hull-based company, established in , and is the largest independent buildersrsquo merchant.

Officially revealed at the  Geneva Motor Show, the Mini took the motoring world by storm, thanks to its retro looks and classy interior. Then, when they hit the road, it soon became clear BMW had crafted a car that wasnt just great to look at, but great to drive too.Prices started at pound, for the Mini One, rising to pound, for the more powerful Cooper iant, with both being built in Oxford and hitting the market in the UK two months before anywhere  in the world.Arrival of the Cooper SHot on the heels of the One and Cooper iants came the Cooper S. With performance in mind, it combined a .-litre petrol engine with a supercharger, resulting in a lot more power than the standard version. It had a more focused suspension set-up too, while the bonnet air intake became a design feature for all future Cooper S models.Production ramps upIncredibly, by May  ndash just over a year since it went on sale ndash the ,th Mini was produced at BMW Groups Oxford plant. It was a testament to the success of the design and execution of the Mini, thats for sure.The Mini goes drop-topFlash forward to  and the Mini Convertible arrived, bringing that wind-in-your-hair experience to the already-popular model. It still retained space for four, but used a fabric roof that folds up behind the rear seats and didnt require a cover.The boot may have been small at  litres with the roof open, but as with the rest of the range, the Convertible sold like hotcakes.Arrival of the GPThings took a turn for the more serious, with the arrival of the GP in . Limited to just , models worldwide ndash with  made available to UK buyers ndash the lighter, faster and meaner GP sold out before a single customer had even driven a car.Arriving as the most powerful production Mini to date, it used the same .-litre supercharged petrol engine as the Cooper S, but it was boosted for more power while plenty of weight was stripped from the cabin to make the GP even more exciting to drive.The dficult second albumIn August , Mini chose to reveal its second-generation car. It retained the same retro look like the original but was bigger and more efficient than before. The .-litre engine was changed, while the Cooper S used turbocharging instead of supercharging for the first time. Prices increased, too, with the One starting from pound, and the Cooper commanding pound,.Here comes the ClubmanMini took its first step in expanding the range with the introduction of the Clubman in . Debuting a new, estate car-like layout, the Clubman offered more space than the conventional hatch but retained the standard cars nimble handling and punchy range of engines.The start of electricationAt the  Los Angeles Auto Show, Mini presented the E, an electric concept. It created  Mini E vehicles, which were shipped for testing by private customers in Calornia, New York and New Jersey, with the results from this trial relayed back to Mini. It also helped BMW to develop its electric i model.The Countryman hits the roadNot content with the Clubman, Mini expanded the range in  with the Countryman. Taking advantage of the growing appetite for SUVs, the Countryman effectively took the Mini recipe and raised it further off the ground.It had seating for five, four doors and a reasonably large boot. It also retained the same funky styling that you got from the standard hatch.The Roadster and Coupe add even more styleMoving along to  saw the introduction of the Mini Coupe, a two-seater version of the standard hatch which was famously styled to resemble a backwards-facing baseball cap. It was joined by a soft-top version ndash the Roadster. It used a fabric roof like the standard convertible, but had a sleeker, more aerodynamically focused design.A change of pace for MiniIn , Mini introduced the Paceman, which represented a mash-up of an SUV and hatchback. In truth, it was a slightly odd combination, as it had an upright body style but just three doors. Sitting alongside the rest of the Mini line-up, it saw the firms range of cars swell to seven.Third times the charmShortly after the introduction of the Paceman came the introduction of a third-generation hatch. It debuted a new interpretation of the cars classic styling, but was still built in Oxford and was centred around that fun-to-drive experience. Arriving in , the third-generation hatch was bigger in every sense and utilised .-litre three-cylinder engines ndash though the more powerful Cooper S benefitted from a four-cylinder, .-litre petrol.The Mini gains a set of doorsShortly after the arrival of the third-generation Mini came a new, five-door iant, which brought improved rear legroom, a third rear seat, and a more accessible cabin. It has continued to be a great option even today.The Clubman ndash betteredMini followed on from the revitalisation of its hatchback with the introduction of a revised Clubman. It was bigger than before but retained the useful split rear doors, which gave access to a larger boot than before.An electried CountrymanIn , Mini showcased a real attempt at electrication with its Countryman Plug-in hybrid. The first hybrid model to be offered by the brand, it combined a three-cylinder petrol engine with an electric motor and batteries. Capable of driving for up to  miles on battery-power alone, it was easily the most economical car in Minis stable.The Mini goes electricThe year  proved to be a big deal for Mini, as it was when the companys first EV arrived in showrooms ndash the Mini Electric. Its styling was largely unchanged over the regular petrol and diesel models, while a zippy electric motor ensured it delivered the same winning driving experience. The Mini Electric has gone on to prove popular, despite its relatively short range of  miles.The present dayIn January , Mini presented the latest incarnation of its famous hatchback, delivering a new look and a range of technology updates. Though the styling was classical Mini, some key refinements ndash such as a new body-coloured front grille ndash ensure that it has remained looking sharp and up to date."},{"url":null,"title":"gardening-squirrel-proof-bird-feeders-actually-work","story":"Gardening: Do squirrel-proof bird feeders actually work A squirrel feederI have long had a problem with grey squirrels. They feast on birdseed in trays, play acrobatics to jump on fat ball feeders and make light work of scaling metal poles to steal the peanuts from my bird feeders.So, is there really a squirrel-proof feeder which works Matthew Tume, RSPB product manager of birdcare and optics, says that in reality, no product on the market is totally squirrel-proof.\"Squirrels are very intelligent and very determined, and they will find ways around things.\"However, Rachel Schofield, of birdfood and wildle product specialist CJ Wildle, says: \"Theres a great number of really good squirrel-proof feeders on the market, as far as adult squirrels are concerned. Juveniles, however, can squeeze through protective cages.\"What material should you go for \"Metal and preferably powder-coated. Plastic feeders wont last very long. You can buy protective cages for many feeders, but its cheaper to buy an integrated unit,\" says Schofield.\"Squirrels can chew through plastic ports, so we would recommend you use metal feeders, rather than plastic ones,\" Tume agrees.What about birdseed Youre best off with a no waste seed mix, says Schofield, which will help deter pigeons and squirrels from picking up the discarded husks which smaller birds deposit on to the ground. You can buy huskless seeds and sunflower hearts.\"De-husked ieties will be more expensive, but you get what you pay for. Reputable companies which sell good quality seed mixes wont pack them full of wheat or maize. And using de-husked ieties means that birds dont lose time trying to get to the nutrients,\" says Schofield.Where should I put the feeders \"Set them away from jumping-off points, such as fences and hanging trees. However, there is a balance. You want your feeders to have a degree of cover, as the further out in the open they are, the easier it is for predators - such as birds of prey - to spot them,\" says Tume.Are there any other ways to deter squirrels Some people suggest dusting the birdseed with chilli powder or hot sauce like Tabasco, which apparently doesnt bother the birds, but the squirrels dont like the spice, says Tume.Others recommend smearing your bird feeder poles with Vaseline to stop the squirrels climbing up them.Or, you could always try putting up a squirrel feeder at the other end of the garden, away from your bird station, and give visiting squirrels some peanuts of their own.On test: Which squirrel deterrents should I consider Feeder s\"There are feeder s, which are effectively cages which go around your feeders. You hang your feeders inside the cage. The idea is that the cage holes are big enough for small birds to enter and exit safely, and small enough to act as a deterrent for squirrels. They make it more dficult for squirrels to access, but juveniles will be able to squeeze through,\" says Tume.\"Smaller birds - such as blue tits, goldfinches and greenfinches - will be able to fly in and out of the cages, but larger birds - such as jackdaws and magpies - may be deterred, although magpies have long necks, so may be able to reach through to get the seed, depending on the gap between the cage wall and the feeder.\"They should be made to the exact specication which allows small birds in safely, but also deters adult squirrels and large birds,\" he adds.Tried  Tested: The Squirrel  Port Adventurer withThis was the only item which really stopped the squirrel in its tracks. It managed to jump on to the top of the feeder from a tall shrub but was too big to get through the metal guard. It even tried to open the lid of the tubular feeder, but couldnt get in.Squirrel bafflesThese are plastic domes which fit either over the bird feeder, or half way up the poleyou are securing the feeder from the ground, but under the feeding stations. They aim to prevent squirrels from descending on to or climbing up to the feeders.\"If they manage to climb on to the baffle, the baffle often rocks the squirrels loose, so they fall off,\" says Tume. \"We get mixed feedback on them.\"Tried  Tested: The Squirrel Guard Baffle This cone did stop the squirrels from climbing up to reach the feeder, but one managed to get on to the feeder from above, and then accessed the food. However, once Id moved the pole away from tall shrubs and trees from which it could gain access, the baffle worked very well.The weighted feederSquirrel Buster feeders are weighted devices which shut off access to the feeding points when a squirrel or heavy pigeon lands on them, via a metal shutter. These are widely available and one of the most popular deterrents.Tried  Tested: The Squirrel Buster Peanut Birdfeeder I made the mistake of hanging this weighted feeder from a bracket on my garden fencepost, which enabled the squirrel to access the peanuts by taking its weight on its back legs on the fence and then gently placing its front paws on the feeder.It didnt manage to get much food though, as the feeder bobbed up and down as its weight distribution changed. Place the feeder in a clear space with no other balancing points nearby, and it will be much more effective."},{"url":null,"title":"hannah-simone-for-sake-comedy-pit-women-other","story":"Overflowing with charmingly relatable, and, at times, utterly bizarre story arcs, US sitcom New Girl was quick to capture the hearts of viewers on both sides of the Atlantic.It is, in essence, the ultimate embodiment of le during your late s and early s.Encapsulating the day-to-day escapades of four equally quirky characters living under one roof, the show quickly achieved cult status, running for a grand total of  episodes before finally drawing to an end in .Now, as the show prepares to mark its th anniversary, Disney has announced that New Girl will be available to a whole new audience when it arrives on Star on the Disney+ streaming service this April.\"I mean, I would be up for it.

So our friendship was really close.\"And then when the writers and the creators of the show genuinely saw how close Lamorne and I were, they then started to write it into the show, which is why Winston and Cece became this kind of like very odd but wonderful duo.\"Its a friendship that translated seamlessly onto our screens, including the finer details such as the pairs synchronised finger clicks.\"I remember Lamorne and I on set doing this kind of like, snap, snap thing that kind of moment when we agreed on something.\"And then it made it into the show.\"And it was just a wonderful, genuinely funny moment for me that my weird little friendship that I have in real le with Lamorne had become such a huge part of the show and something that people really liked.\"So I love that I love that people really dig Winston and Cece and their mess arounds.\"The shows lasting legacyComprising of seven series and making up over a hundred hours worth of viewing time, New Girls legacy will continue to live on - both on our screens and as memories for the actors themselves.\"It was almost a decade of my le,\" notes Simone of the shows run.\"Its a huge part of who I am personally now...

One of the main issues with the Westminster system and First Past The Past is that it is not proportional. In theory, the combined vote against the winner is often more than voted for the winner, and Scotlands voting system attempts to tackle this by bringing in a second vote.The Second VoteThe Additional Member System , based on the German mixed-member proportionalsystem, is used in Scotland and is signicantly more proportional than FPTP. Such an election system is known as a hybrid electoral system. AMS means that the overall number of MSPs elected for each party is roughly proportional to their electoral support.

We cannot manage what we cannot measure, which is why it is often left out of the carbon equation.:Claire Taylor: Indyref and a blinkered green agenda could harm Scottish farmings futureThis could all be about to change. Last week saw the launch of a global farm metric ndash a common benchmark to measure the sustainability of food and farming. I attended a TEDx event hosted by the Sustainable Food Trust which is leading a new coalition to establish a standardised approach for assessing the sustainability credentials of dferent farms. A common toolkit which will be rolled out internationally and will allow us to present a harmonised approach to measuring and managing agriculturersquos global emissions.Finally, the role our grasslands play in storing carbon will be properly recorded and recognised for their valuable contribution towards our journey to net zero emissions. It is now up to the next Scottish Government to embrace this global farm metric and start recognising farming as part of the solution.Farming practices will have to change to be part of this journey and I believe from speaking to farmers and reading the manestorsquos of dferent farming organisations that they are ready and up to the challenge, but this sht in production will require long term commitments over future funding.If farmers are going to be tasked with producing more environmentally friendly food which comes with a higher price tag, this has to be reflected in the value of food or  farmers will continue to need subsidies in order to keep food affordable for the public.Farmers today are producing food which is sold at the same price as it was  years ago. The same certainly canrsquot be said for the price of clothing, petrol or house prices.If we as consumers really value a future where low carbon produce becomes a staple in our shopping baskets, then we might have to start footing some of the bill.We all go into our local supermarket with the moral intentions of choosing food which supports good animal welfare and boasts environmental protections, but % of us go in and buy based on price.Food is cheap and we are so disconnected from the way it is produced that we often donrsquot value it and think nothing of throwing it away. Why  do we allow % of UK food to end up in the bin But are we lazy consumers with a disregard for seasonality and the origins of our food, or is it simply that we are overwhelmed by too much choice on the shelves that we canrsquot begin to understand the impact of our purchases :Claire Taylor: Blue Peter has no right to push an anti-meat agendaWe all might recognise a free-range egg label or red tractor assurance mark, but do we really feel equipped to make informed choices on the sustainability of our purchases  I back the proposals by the Scottish Greens and the SNP to introduce carbon labelling, but will it not all ultimately come back to a case of price During the TEDx event, the Chief Executive of Morrisonrsquos explained: ldquoChoice often means the balance between price and quality, price and provenance, price and healthier ingredients, but it always comes down to price.Morrisonrsquos have a clever solution to remove the pressure from consumers and place the onus on themselves to provide sustainable produce on their shelves. In March they announced that they would only be supplied by net zero carbon farms by  and will be working with their  farmers and growers to produce affordable net zero carbon meat, fruit, vegetables, and eggs. This takes away the uncertainty and ambiguity for its customers.As a nation emerging from a pandemic with rising levels of poverty and social inequality, we cannot expect the public to be putting sustainability at the top of their list, but longer term the responsibility will have to be shared by consumers.We as the public need to play our part in tackling the climate emergency and committing to responsible food choices is a good place to start. We need to start valuing the produce on our shelves and nipping in the bud the throwaway culture which has resulted from our disconnect.There is an urgency to rebuild our relationship with food and our understanding of how it Is produced. All roads lead back to education, and by introducing sustainable food production as part of the national curriculum will equip the next generation with the knowledge to make responsible food choices.Constitutional issues cannot be allowed to dominate and ide discussion over the next five years. A collaborative approach is needed to properly address and tackle the looming climate emergency and how our food is produced, purchased, and consumed has to be front and centre of policy decisions."},{"url":null,"title":"janey-godley-george-galloway-jakey-accents-alienating-voters","story":"ldquoThat guy George is obsessed with you a mate on twitter told me, I was very excited.

After all, therersquos nothing like a threat to one and all for some to see it simply as a threat to themselves alone and the rest be damned.Irsquom talking about the Covid- pandemic and the insightful and sometimes rather unedying responses to it by those countries that have adequate defences, towards those countries that do not.Be it vaccine, oxygen, ventilator stocks or general health care provision, you canrsquot help but notice a certain, ldquoIrsquom alright, Jack, mentality increasingly prevalent right now.Arguably, it was always going to be this way once those rich developed nations got over the initial shock of being caught wrongfooted by the virus and began to put their house in order. But my, how quickly and unreservedly that safety ladder has been pulled up letting others sink into the abyss.Donrsquot get me wrong, itrsquos only understandable that there should be a palpable sense of relief here in the UK and any country that has managed to turn a corner in the fight against the pandemic. Whatrsquos far less comprehensible though is the misguided notion of singularity or exceptionalism in a global crisis.If ever one detail was a sharp reminder of that, itrsquos the news that India, one of the worldrsquos biggest producers of vaccines, wonrsquot be exporting many for a while.This means that COVAX, the global initiative aimed at equitable access to the Covid- vaccine, has lost much of the supply produced by the Pune-based Serum Institute of India.In the words of one vaccine expert, ldquoright now COVAX has ground to a shuddering halt... wersquore at the point of where wersquore trying to rearrange the deck chairs on the Titanic.This in turn means that many of the poorer countries that were relying on such supplies will be impacted and even some of the richer ones in Europe and where who are beginning to exit the crisis could well find themselves affected.In other words, here once again is more proof ndashit were needed ndash of the truism that no one is safe until everyone is safe. Whatever happened to those leaders and governments that were once enthusiastic chanters of such a mantra  It didnrsquot take long it seems for them to forget the words to this chorus of caringFor the grim inescapable fact is that while many in the West are cock-a-hoop about the rapid roll out of vaccines, the pandemic is gathering pace where. India is the most obvious recent example, but many now fear that numerous African countries are about to plummet down that same terrible track.ldquoTwo months ago, India was doing a victory dance and handing out vaccines around the world like candies, observed Dr Ayoade Alakija, co-chair of the Africa Vaccine Delivery Alliance, which is co-ordinating distribution on the continent.ldquoThey were saying how wonderfully they had done because of the immunity and the youth of their population. Look where India is today, was Dr Alakijarsquos timely reminder this week.Indiarsquos catastrophe is all the proof needed, say health experts like her, of what could happen in Africavaccination campaigns are not rapidly accelerated, and the virus is allowed to spread and mutate. And Africa of course is not unique in this respect with South and Central America experiencing another surge that contributed this week to a record near million cases reported globally on a single day.So much of what has unfolded politically around the world during the pandemic has given us an insight, sometimes chilling, into the way global politics and many governments and leaders worldwide operate.What lessons might we take for example from the fact that the top five slots in the geographical mortality rankings all belong to countries run by populists when the pandemic began ndash the US, Brazil, Mexico, India, and Britain.As Gideon Lasco, a leading global medical anthropologist at the University of the Philippines, noted recently ldquomedical populist politicians like Indiarsquos Prime Minister Narendra Modi, President Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil, and former US president Donald Trump, all rose to power and ruled in populist styles.This allowed for an oversimplication of the pandemic and enabled them to flag up their own frequently misguided solutions while forging isions across their nations in the process.What to make then of the call this week by Gordon Brown to the foreign ministers of the worldrsquos leading economies, meeting in London as part of the G Summit, to fund a bn two-year vaccine and healthcare support package for poor countries On the face of it, Mr Brownrsquos humanitarian rallying call makes sense. But coming as it does in the wake of the UK Governmentrsquos bafflingly stupid decision to cut le-saving overseas aid for water and sanitation projects amid the pandemic, it only underlines the mixed motives and messages coming from nations in the developed world.At its most cynical and some might even argue predatory level, there are those countries, too, who now clearly view their capacity to supply vaccines through the prism of international competition.If we give you desperately needed vaccines, you give us concessions goes the current thinking. These concessions might take the shape of access to natural resources and markets or helping turn the screw on political rivals as China has done in pressuring other countries into derecognising Taiwan infor vaccine supplies.Itrsquos all a far cry from those early days of the pandemic when some global leaders spoke of universal vaccines and aid as a moral course of action and the way to bring about the swtest end to a disease that affects us all.If the pandemic has perhaps taught us anything and is still teaching us, itrsquos the lesson that responding intelligently to a global crisis of this kind depends on people in high office being smart enough to listen and co-operate with one another. Admittedly, there have been some examples of that, but in the main precious few that really matter.Instead, what we are witnessing now is an ever-more clearly defined demarcation line between those nations able and those less able to cope. The ladder is undeniably being hauled up behind the latter.

It was the first book he purchased after escaping slavery. He was none other than the abolitionist leader and social reformer Frederick Douglass, who passed on the treasure to his son, Lewis, in .From the moment he turned its pages, Frederick Douglass cultivated not only an admiration for Burns, but for the writings of Sir Walter Scott, and a le-long affection for Scotland and the Scottish people.Douglass at his desk at  Gilmore Street in Edinburgh composing persuasive letters and formidable lectures as an anti-slavery activist was only eight years removed from escaping his own trauma of slavery in Maryland in . He must have pondered this as he walked Princes Street or surveyed the city from Calton Hill.:Derided, bullied, but triumphant: the Scottish heroine who planted the seeds of freedomDouglas was in the remarkable position of advocating internationally for human liberty so soon after his own bondage. This rapid rise to prominence was a testament to his talents, but also to the shting moral consciousness of the throngs of people he addressed.He once wrote of Edinburgh: ldquoI enjoy everything here which may be enjoyed by those of a paler hue ndash no distinction here. I have found myself in the society of thehellipfirst people of this city and no one seemed alarmed by my presence.Douglass had initially come to Scotland as part of a tour to Britain and Ireland between  and  and again in  and . His specic engagement with Scotland was to speak out against the Free Church of Scotland which had financed itself through funds that came from slaveholders in the United States.He spoke widely across Scotland, filling up chapels and assembly halls beyond capacity. He first arrived in Glasgow in . Many of his speeches and public appearance in Glasgow were delivered at City Halls in Candleriggs. Audiences and communities responded to his Send Back The Money campaign with fervent support.The story of Douglass in Scotland links to a person he called, \"the single most important influence on his le.\" That personrsquos name was Dr James McCune Smith. A fellow American and former slave, Smith was an extraordinary figure and pioneer.:David Pratt: Indias Covid tragedy shows a tale of two pandemicsHe had been blocked from further education in the United States because he was an African-American.

Smith went onto to earn a bachelorrsquos degree, a masterrsquos degree, and his medical doctorate from the University of Glasgow.

To their great credit, the University of Glasgow has named a new pound million facility the James McCune Smith Learning Hub.Douglassrsquo first visit to Scotland ended with a moving stop in Hawick in the Borders. A reporter wrote that Douglass ldquospoke for nearly two hours, in a calm, cool, dignied, and impressive manner, that shewed him to be qualied above most men to command the attention of an audience. He was enthusiastically praised by the spectators, and then with fond farewells departed for northern England. The first Scottish tour of Douglass was monumental in terms of the scale of people he educated, touched and motivated.The spirit of Douglassrsquo legacy is still intact, but as with all historical figures who advocated for progressive social change, their tones and path prints can fade unless we download their voices, trace their footsteps, and disinter their ideas from the clutch of distant history.:Uzma Mir: Why cant Scots, in Scotland, use Scots words, without being called jakeys Douglass would have been inspired by todayrsquos Black Lives Matter movement, in fact, he was a courageous catalyst of it.

The Michelin star has brought great joy and while it was disappointing that we couldnrsquot share it with people at the time in lockdown, it makes it all the more exciting when we do open the doors and welcome people in, said Ms McNee, who trained with the late Andrew Fairlie at his two Michelin star restaurant at the five star Gleneagles hotel.ldquoI donrsquot think there is any feeling like it having a Michelin star. It is amazing and for me as a young chef starting out that is what I strived for. It is quite surreal.ldquoReopening will be about a celebration and it is a time when people will once again be able to mark important milestones and come together in a way they have not be able to recently. It is not just about making great food, it is about being able to bring people into the restaurant and to start to enjoy themselves again.Read more: Covid Scotland: Pandemic set to open floodgates for damages claims, says legal expertWhile diners have still be able to connect with Cail Bruich through the hugely successful dine at home menus, reopening as a Michelin star restaurant while undoubtedly spark a lot of interest.ldquoI think we will get a iety of people through our doors. There are people who travel to Michelin star restaurants from all over the UK, we have our loyal customers and then there might be people in the Glasgow area who havenrsquot had the opportunity to go to a Michelin star restaurant before and will come along, added the -year-old from Morayshire. ldquoWe know that what we do wonrsquot be to everyonersquos tastes, but there will be people who will want to come now because we have the Michelin star.Congratulations came in from the Glasgow hospitality industry and further afield when the announcement was made. There was also messages from fellow Michelin starred chefs now that Ms McNee and Cail Bruich have joined the elite club. Following on from the Michelin star, champagne house Krug invited Ms McNee to become an Ambassade, part of a network of top chefs who develop dishes paired with the fine brand.ldquoGlasgow was very supportive of us when we received the award and we had lots of lovely messages,\" said the head chef who was just five months into her new role when they were awarded the star. \"We really felt that the city had got behind us. The Michelin star is a great boost to the city and the hospitality industry in Glasgow. It can make others more competitive and to strive to be as good as they can and it also made people happy that someone had brought a Michelin star back to the city.Menu planning has been underway for some time and the restaurant opened its reservation book last Friday, April , to welcome people back on Wednesday May . And while not giving too many secrets away, there is a little hint of what diners can expect.Ms McNee added: ldquoIt will be a tasting menu we have on offer when we reopen. There wonrsquot be a massive change, but we want to continually get better and better in everything we do.ldquoWhen we closed our doors before lockdown, it was autumn and as someone who is passionate about seasonal produce, so the menu is going to reflect summer and late spring. Scottish asparagus will be in season when we open so expect to see that on the menu along with langoustines which are my absolute favourite. We are also experimenting with duck dishes and how long we are going to age it.ldquoThe team have been tasters, from the kitchen to front of house. Their input and opinion is important. With young chefs they might not have a fully developed palate yet so it is about bringing them on and with front of house it is important they know about the suppliers, how it tastes, to be able to help diners make their informed choice.The Cail Bruich team already had a good relationship with suppliers in the area and across Scotland when they were awarded the Michelin star, but it did lead to some people getting in touch with them direct.ldquoThere have been some places who got in touch such as Blackthorn Scottish Sea Salt [from Ayrshire] who sent their product which is phenomenal. So we will be using that because I think it is a great product and offers something in terms of taste.When bookings opened on Friday, general manager Chris Donnachie said they werenrsquot quite sure what to expect following lockdown closures. However, they werenrsquot left disappointed as by the end of the day they were fully booked to near the end of June, the period of time they had opened bookings up for.ldquoI think there was a little apprehension as we had been closed for some months now, but the response has been quite unbelievable, said Mr Donnachie. ldquoWe are fully booked through to near the end of June which was the point we wanted to get to as covid restrictions may well ease further from then.ldquoWhen Cail Bruich was awarded the Michelin star earlier this year, we would have loved to have been able to open the next day to mark that but it was a time of lockdown. Such a huge part of what we do and revel in is the social interaction with our guests. Scotland has such a warmth in the sense of its hospitality and we love providing that experience.Working in partnership with Scottish brands to develop their own offerings has seen Cail Bruich work with Glasgow-based The Garden Shed Drinks Company to stock their own gin, a collaboration with beer firm Pilot and they are also planning to stock their own tonic water through a link up with Walter Gregorrsquos handcrafted tonic firm.As for the future the Cail Bruich team believe a second Michelin star is not an unrealistic expectation and they have also added to the team with the addition of two new front of house staff and two new kitchen staff.ldquoWhen we reopen we want to smash it out the park and exceed expectations and we certainly do have aspirations for a second star, added Mr Donnachie. ldquoWe believe we have the capability to do that with a fantastic team."},{"url":null,"title":"iain-macwhirter-referendum-wont-happen-neither-side-wants-one","story":"Boring because there has been no contest ndash everyone knows the winner already. Signicant because it could mean the end of the United Kingdom. At least, that is the view of the London media. The reality is both boring and signicant: there is not going to be a referendum because neither side actually wants one right now.Curiously, the expectation of a referendum seems to be greater in Westminster than in Holyrood. Weve been hearing muffled cries of panic from Whitehall for months. Former Cabinet Office mandarins like Ciaran Martin insist that following this victory for the parties of independence there is ldquono democratically legitimate basis to refuse a referendum. Boris Johnson is still minded to say ldquonow is not the time, but his constitutional insecurity is demonstrated by the fact that hes afraid to show his face in Scotland to defend the Union at this critical juncture.There is talk of a court challenge against the SNPs forthcoming independence bill. Thatsthe Scottish Government doesnt get there first. Theres also going to be ldquobillions on road and rail spending with a Union Flag on it ndash even a ldquofixed crossing to Northern Ireland, or so were told. The Internal Market Act will allow the UK Government to spend over the heads of Holyrood and win hearts and minds. Well, perhaps.Read more: WhatBoris Johnson rejects second referendum Yet curiously, Nicola Sturgeon has insisted that this election ldquois not about independence. The very idea! Its about her ldquosensible leadership and recovery from Covid, under the only political leader who seems to want the job. A referendum will not happen until ldquothe crisis is over, which could be many years since the economic Covid crisis has yet to begin.This may seem like a remarkable about-face for the SNP leader. For the past two years, she has talked of little  but a referendum on independence. Even Covid was expressed in constitutional terms: ldquoAn independence referendum is an essential priority, she said repeatedly,Scotland was to build back better after the pandemic.As recently as November, her Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, insisted that there would a referendum ldquonext year by which he meant . The Constitution Secretary, Michael Russell, said in January that the referendum would happen by Christmas, with or without a Section  Order from Westminster. ldquoThe Franchise Act was approved last year, he said, ldquoso the nuts and bolts are there.Buttomorrows election is really all about ldquoseeking a clear endorsement for a referendum on independence as Ms Sturgeon told parliament in September, you might have thought it would be right up there, centre stage. Yet two words absent from the SNP leaflet that came through my door last week were ldquoindependence and ldquoreferendum. It seems it no longer regards it a necessary precondition for Covid recovery or for keeping Mr Johnsons grasping Brexit hands off the fragile powers of the Scottish Parliament.The UK Government regards all this as devious down-playing of indyref rhetoric, all the better to propel Scotland into holding one. On Saturday, it thinks, she will suddenly declare that this election had ldquoof course been about an independence referendum, and that the mandate for holding one is now unanswerable. Ms Sturgeon will no doubt say something like this, but I dont think that means there will be a referendum on the timescale her minions had been suggesting. Ms Sturgeon isnt a loser, and her recent silence on crucial post-Brexit issues of border, currency and debt betrays her lack of confidence in winning any early referendum.Read more: Sturgeonrsquos border problem could possibly kill Yes vote stone deadThe First Minister made clear this week that she favours turning indyref into a battle in the courts. When ldquothis crisis is over Holyrood will pass a bill declaring a referendum and then defy Westminster to strike it down. Actually, it doesnt have to because no act of Holyrood, especially one on the constitution, can pass without the express endorsement of the UK Parliament.It was clear in the Miller case in  that the UK Supreme Court, which would ultimately decide this matter, takes a maximalist view of parliamentary sovereignty. It believes that Westminster can safely ignore any act of the Scottish Parliament. The Sewel Convention, which supposedly requires Westminster to consent to acts of Holyrood, is just that: a convention. The constitution is one of the reserved powers retained at Westminster under the  Scotland Act.In response, the Scottish Governments lawyers will argue that, while Holyrood cannot legislate for a legally-binding referendum on independence, it can legislate for and hold a consultative referendum. Ms Sturgeon has long accepted that a full-fat referendum would require a Section  Order from Westminster, but an indy-lite plebiscite, just asking the views of Scottish voters, is probably within Holyroods powers. Local authorities are empowered to hold referendums on water privatisation and road pricing, so why shouldnt Holyrood Whether she would actually want such a non-binding referendum is of course another matter. I seriously doubtshe would because it would likely be meaningless. Since it carries no constitutional weight, most unionists would likely boycott it. It would be like the  Catalonian referendum in which  per cent voted Yes on a % turnout. It might carry even less meaning than a series of opinion polls, which are probably a more accurate reflection of what Scotland actually thinks.So why bother with pursuing this through the courts  Well, perhaps because it would be a way of parking the whole independence issue. Indeed, fighting a phoney war about a referendum that will never happen might suit both sides. Passions would overflow in the synthetic world of social media while lawyers exchanged abstruse formulations of a problem that doesnt actually exist about a referendum that would never happen.Its something a French post-modernist, like Jean Baudrillard would instantly recognise: a meta-battle fought over signs and signiers of independence rather than self-government itself. A simulacrum of political reality. Meanwhile, le goes on until Ms Sturgeon departs to write that book she has promised.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

It would be easy to point out that in that same year we also got Brexit, and as Sir Tom Devine says: ldquoI cannot recall any issue of such magnitude since  [the Act of Union] where the manest will of the Scottish people, as confirmed explicitly by virtually all the nationrsquos MPs in the UK Parliament, and overwhelmingly by a democratic vote in a UK referendum, was not only rejected, but treated with such brazen contempt by a British Government.David Cameronrsquos am announcement on the day after the referendum vote, of Evelwas not a good start. This is particularly so as Scotland, during successive Conservative governments, had become used to legislation which the majority of Scottish MPs had voted against . However, since then there have been a iety of actions by the UK Government which confirm, without a shadow of a doubt, Sir Tomrsquos view of Brexit.In particular the Internal Market Act is contrary to devolution powers in a number of areas, including food and environmental standards because of the Actrsquos requirement of ldquomutual recognition of standards, so that, for instance, food produced to lower standards where can still be sold in Scottish shops, irrespective of legal requirements in Scotland. Moreover, the Actrsquos ldquomarket access principles could lead to the privatisation of the Scottish NHS, again irrespective of the views of the elected Scottish Government.But perhaps the current high-water mark of contempt for Scotland from Westminster concerns two Holyrood bills, which have cross-party support, incorporating the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and the European Charter of Local Self-Government in Scottish Law. However, Holyroodrsquos competence is being challenged at the Supreme Court by our Secretary of State, Alister Jack, claiming: ldquoWhat [Holyrood] cannot do is seek to make provision that constrains the UK Parliamentrsquos ability to make laws for Scotland.As Ciaran Martin, a former constitution director at the Cabinet Office has pointed out, ldquothere are no limits to which Westminster can go to block Scottish independence, even on matters that Westminster agreed to devolve.Alasdair Galloway, Dumbarton.* PETER A Russell takes me to task for failing to cite the setting up of the Smith Commission as the response of the UK Government to the Scottish independence referendum of . This was a completely inadequate response, but do not take my word for it.I refer Mr Russell to the article today by Andy Maciver, former Head of Communications for the Scottish Conservatives , and I quote an extract: ldquoUnionismrsquos response to the SNP winning the  election was the meek extra powers of the Calman commission its response to nearly losing the first referendum was the Smith Commission. Each time, Scotland wanted a slice of cake and was given a crumb.Alan M Morris, Blanefield.SEATS MAJORITY IS NOT ENOUGHIN  the SNP won  per cent of constituency votes and with the Greens accounted for % of list votes on a turnout of %. This time it seems likely that the turnout will be lower eventhe joint SNP plus Green vote exceeds % of those voting it seems highly likely that the votes in favour of parties backing another referendum will have the positive support of under % of the electorate. To my mind that is far too weak a base on which to build a huge constitutional change.I recall the  devolution referendum where the devolution effort was scuppered by the requirement to muster the support of % of the electorate. I thought that was unfair. But independence is a far bigger step than devolution. The idea that independence could be gained on the basis of a % plus  majority seems to me to very isive.Nicola Sturgeon has acknowledged that she needs to persuade a convincing majority of the Scottish electorate before she goes for another referendum. It is good that she says this, but it would be bettershe laid to rest the claim that a majority of seats in the new parliament,gained on a vote of well under a third of the electorate, represents an unanswerable democratic demand for a new referendum.Geoff Cohen, Edinburgh. YEARS FOR EU MEMBERSHIPIT may be acceptablefor the SNP to refuse to address questions surrounding the economic case for Scotland leaving the UK until it publishes its case in the run-up to a referendum.However, it tends to present Scotland in the UK and Scotland in Europe as though they were immediately-viable alternative outcomes. This is simply not the case.There would appear to be four sequential stages to Scotland becoming an independent country in the EU.The first stage covers the period from reaching agreement in principle with the UK Government about holding a referendum until that referendum takes place. For the  referendum this took . years.Then, following a vote in favour of Scotland leaving the UK, there would be a period of negotiation on the terms of the separation. The issues are much more complex than for Brexit, so it is hard to see that period being less than the . years that took.At this point Scotland becomes an independent country but outside the UK and outside the EU.To join the EU, Scotland must demonstrate that it has a properly ing market economy. This is very unlikely to be achieved until Scotland has a central bank controlling its own currency. The SNP Sustainable Growth Commission suggested that thiswould take  years, though other commentators consider this optimistic.Finally, the process of applying for EU membership, negotiating the terms and EU member states ratying that agreement can be expected to take four to five years.So in total, Scotland appears to be around  years away from EU membership.This would be a period of continued uncertainty and, with border friction affecting all international trade, it is hardly an environment to encourage investment.It would aid the debatethose in favour of seceding set out the timescale to achieving their objective of an independent Scotland within the EU and concede that there will be some very challenging economic issues to address to get from here to there.George Rennie, Inverness.GIVEAWAYS ARE UK-FUNDEDTHE SNP election manesto is a cornucopia of giveaways. Another pound billion for the Scottish National Investment Bank, free dental care, a pay rise for NHS staff, free laptops and bikes, bonds of up to pound, for families to remain in or move to underpopulated areashellip the list of monies to be spent is almost limitless. And in among them, a commitment not to raise income tax and to freeze LBTT. For a country already deep in deficit, how is this to be achieved Ah, the largesse of HM Treasury will pay for it. If ever there were an admission that Scotland is better off in the UK, the SNP manesto is it.Jill Stephenson, Edinburgh.* AFTER all the rhetoric since  we are nowhere nearer finding the true cost of independence except \"it will be alright on the night\", which is hardly an endorsement.Independence was supposed to make us better off andthat cannot be demonstrated to be the case then what is the point of embracing decades of independent austerity just to beat our chests that were independent, but with the caveat we will be joining another even more remote union We do not need to make the rest of the UK our competitors.Allan Thompson, Bearsden.TORIES SHOULD APOLOGISEBORIS Johnson is known to be a habitual and addictive liar and it seems this illness is infectious to his party members, for in the latest Tory TV broadcast, Ruth Davidson claimed definitively thatSNP won a majority, it would pursue a new referendum immediately, when in fact it was made clear by Nicola Sturgeon that it would not do so until the Covid- pandemic had been resolved.

Most local authorities provide a bin for residents to put their food and garden waste in, for weekly or fortnightly collection and recycling, many miles from the point of collection. However, for anyone with a garden or allotment there is a much simpler, easier, and cheaper solution Using pallets or other waste wood, why not construct a home-composting system  Nearly all food waste, with the possible exception of meat and fish, can be put in your bin add grass cuttings, cardboard , shredded paper, annual weeds, some seaweed, and horse or cow manure. When full, turn into an empty bin and start filling the first one again. By the end of a summer you will have a large bin full of nourishment for your garden for next year.

They reported the finding to the RSPCA.As well as real specimens, researchers used simulations to help understand how dferent seals propel themselves through the water.Lead author David Hocking, of Monash University, teamed up with engineer Dr Shibo Wang, from the universityrsquos department of mechanical and aerospace engineering, to use simulations to show how water flows around seal flippers of dferent shapes.Dr Hocking said: ldquoOur analysis showed that some Antarctic seals, like leopard seals, actually have very streamlined, wing-like forelimbs, despite being from the lsquofoot-propelledrsquo seal family.The discovery shows how wing-like flippers can evolve in seals that already swim with their back feet, providing a pathway for the evolution of forelimb swimming in the fur seals and sea lions.Dr Park added: ldquoWe found that grey seals still use their paws to hold their prey when processing it, but other seals like leopard seals have forgone this ability to maximise their swimming speed and agility, being able to capture more mobile prey.Researchers said that as well as explaining the origin of seals, this study may also improve human design.Dr Hocking said: ldquoSeals have had millions of years to perfect their swimming, and they can teach us a thing or two about underwater grace and elegance.ldquoLearning from them may help us to improve the design of human-built machines like underwater drones and submersibles, increasing their speed, manoeuvrability or energy efficiency.rsquondash The study is published in Current Biology.copy -.

Simply because until you have planning permission you don’t have a product.“And the market moves, so a figure now could be out of date in six month’s time. I have been encouraged, though, by the new five per cent deposit mortgages the government are backing. I hope that could be really helpful.“Lenders are also starting to offer mortgages at five and a half times buyers’ earnings as opposed to four or four and a half times, so that will also help with how much people can borrow.”He added: “Because of the proximity to the schools and Portree it is not going to appeal to people who are looking to buy a holiday home. They want to be in the middle of nowhere.“I think it is going to appeal to people who are looking to buy it as their main home and want access to the schools and decent internet so they can work.”As an extra incentive the developer plans to connect all the houses via a full fibre GB broadband connection to the nearby BT exchange.“This connection will be provided by us completely free of charge for the first five years,” he added.“This is possible because the capacity we will have for the hotel is well beyond what we will need. This is still subject to BT surveys, though, but it is a realistic aspiration.”The housing scheme, which Mr Garton Jones describes as “an amalgam of Highland and Scandinavian culture” has been designed by Plockton-based architect Olli Blair, who caught the eye of the developer with his work on the Raasay Distillery building.Mr Garton Jones said he hoped to get on site by September October this year.The Bracken Hide Hotel is scheduled to open in April .If anyone is looking for more information on the homes or to register an interest they can contact Mr Garton Jones via charlie@gartonjones"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/WATERNISH-CYCLE-1.jpg","title":"waternish youngsters raise more than 7000 with","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoinePat Matheson from Halistra lost her husband Campbell to the illness, and her family thought it would be a good idea to raise funds for the charity in memory of Campbell and to raise awareness of AMMF.

Therefore, they need to understand both the risks to themselves and the benefits to themselves of being vaccinated.”Ms Donnelly also said revised guidance saying people under  years old should be offered an alternative vaccine to the AstraZeneca jab was likely to encourage younger people to come forward.However, she said the change in guidelines, which was introduced in response to safety concerns over the AstraZeneca vaccine, had pushed back the scheduled completion date for the programme to August.She said: “We are not giving up on any of the age groups. We are still trying to target % uptake and we have good reason to believe that will be achieved.“However, with the recent JCVIadvice, you will understand that the programme now has to really conserve its steady supply of Pfizer.“We have had supply that has been steady and predictable and we are able to plan on the basis of it, but that means because we are not using very much of the AstraZeneca for the younger age population, it is now going to take us several more weeks to complete the programme.”Ms Donnelly also ruled out the possibility that the programme would be redesigned to offer the vaccine to people according to occupation.“We will get to everyone eventually,” she said.Belfast Most ReadAstonishing antics of NI hospital medic revealed: Doctor Tsakov admits to lewd and racist outbursts and showing porn to colleaguesBobby Sands burial wishes ignored in favour of ‘political beneficial’ Belfast funeralFormer Fermanagh businessman James Balmer  charged with historical sexual abuseRevealed: the BBC NI presenters paid the most for external work‘Tough loss’ for Belfast as Holohans at the Barge restaurant announces closureTop VideosPlayWatch: Suzanne Breen gives her take on the DUP leadership racePlayPro-united Ireland poster removed from Divis Tower in Belfast PlayTrial of two veterans accused of IRA leader murder collapsesLatest Northern IrelandCoronavirus Northern Ireland: No deaths and  new cases reportedPolice back assessment that loyalist paramilitaries did not threaten port staffHopes to combine Covid- booster and flu jab programmes in autumn, MLAs toldMissing Lurgan schoolboy found ‘safe and well’Anger over reports UK Government planning blanket Troubles amnestyLatestCoronavirus Northern Ireland: No deaths and  new cases reportedEngineers and biologists join forces to reveal how seals evolved to swimFormer John Lewis boss Paula Nickolds joins Sainsbury’sPolice back assessment that loyalist paramilitaries did not threaten port staffKate promises to turn up in pink dress for four-year-old Mila,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

This is arguably one of the least affected sectors from the ious lockdown restrictions.“Only  manufacturing jobs came off furlough in March relative to the previous month. That means a sizeable , jobs within manufacturing, or  in  of all jobs, are currently out of action.“The concern is that a signicant number of these jobs may be lost when the furlough scheme expires.

He was a  chair for the Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce on February  and a list at an event at Queen’s University in Belfast on March .Both of these were in the earnings bracket of up to £,.Also listed is BBC NI weatherman and presenter Barra Best, who hosted an event for Charter NI and the Short Strand Community Forum on February . He received a fee under £,, as did his colleague and Radio Ulster presenter and producer Nicola Weir when she chaired a  for Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon City Council on February .Business correspondent Clodagh Rice was listed for chairing a  for Belfast’s politan Arts Centre on March , while political journalist and presenter Mark Carruthers hosted an event for the Northern Ireland Bureau in Washington on March .BBC Radio Ulster’s Evening Extra presenter Declan Harvey hosted an event for Bryson on March .All of the above were also in the less than £, category.Across the network, Radio  Today presenter Justin Webb, who earns more than £, at the BBC, appears most often in the “£, or above” tier for speaking or hosting events for the Chartered Institute for Securities  Investment, City Wealth Magazine, management consultancy Proxima and the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders.Newsnight presenter Emily Maitlis earned more than £, for hosting an event for commercial law firm Mason Hayes and Curran on top of her £, BBC salary, while fellow host Kirsty Wark is recorded in the category as a moderator for the WISH Foundation for Global Health.Veteran presenter Andrew Marr, who earns £,, also received over £, for hosting an event for investment management firm Brewin Dolphin.Today presenter Mishal Husain registered a £,-plus payment from World , while BBC Breakfast’s Naga Munchetty received less than £, to interview a guest for online events company Fane.The engagements registered are for Zoom and webinar appearances, with live conferences still not permitted under Covid- restrictions.The BBC said around % of all appearances, which include full-time and part-time staff, were for a fee below £,, with % of these under £,.Staff must seek written approval from a isional head of department before signing up to any external engagements.A BBC spokesman said: “The BBC’s robust and longstanding editorial guidelines permit staff to carry out additional engagements as long as they do not compromise the integrity or impartiality of the BBC.“The register was announced last October and launched in January as part of a series of measures to ensure the highest standards of impartiality across the organisation. New staff guidance on impartiality and social media use was published last year and new impartiality training was rolled out in January.”Belfast Most ReadAstonishing antics of NI hospital medic revealed: Doctor Tsakov admits to lewd and racist outbursts and showing porn to colleaguesBobby Sands burial wishes ignored in favour of ‘political beneficial’ Belfast funeralFormer Fermanagh businessman James Balmer  charged with historical sexual abuseRevealed: the BBC NI presenters paid the most for external work‘Tough loss’ for Belfast as Holohans at the Barge restaurant announces closureTop VideosPlayWatch: Suzanne Breen gives her take on the DUP leadership racePlayPro-united Ireland poster removed from Divis Tower in Belfast PlayTrial of two veterans accused of IRA leader murder collapsesLatest Northern IrelandCoronavirus Northern Ireland: No deaths and  new cases reportedPolice back assessment that loyalist paramilitaries did not threaten port staffCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Over-s to be offered jab ‘within a few weeks’Hopes to combine Covid- booster and flu jab programmes in autumn, MLAs toldMissing Lurgan schoolboy found ‘safe and well’LatestCoronavirus Northern Ireland: No deaths and  new cases reportedSing when you’re winning  Ed Sheeran joins the musicians who had a ballMeghan aide ‘tried to protect her father from media intrusion’Engineers and biologists join forces to reveal how seals evolved to swimFormer John Lewis boss Paula Nickolds joins Sainsbury’s,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Read MoreCentenary poll: % in Northern Ireland want referendum but would not accept higher taxes to fund reunicationCentenary poll suggests only % of people in Northern Ireland consider Irish language to be importantEsmond Birnie:OpinionOur economy needs recuperation, not a constitutional shockThe Union would be better served by making strong economic arguments for its preservation, rather than politicians heading down the rabbit hole of poking their noses into people#s bedrooms and private lives.Our poll findings suggests that nationalists have a job of work to do to make a strong financial case for a united Ireland, although that is certainly not an impossible task.!fordocument.querySelectortThe Scottish Government produced a -page white paper laying out the case for independence in . There is no sign that a similarly comprehensive blueprint is on the horizon from nationalists here.Our poll indicates that the strongest argument unionists could employ is that Irish unity would hit people in their pockets on both sides of the border.More than half in Northern Ireland think they#d be worse off with just % believing they#d prosper. But % of people were unsure, meaning that the economic arguments on both sides really need to be formed and aired.!fordocument.querySelectortIn the Republic, four in  thought they#d be worse off in a united Ireland, one in five disagreed, and a staggering % didn#t know. If RTE hasn#t already planned it, another Claire Byrne Live to shed light on this part of the debate would be warmly welcomed.A majority on both sides of the border said they wouldn#t be prepared to pay more taxes to fund Irish unity.!fordocument.querySelectortNorthern Ireland currently receives a £bn annual subvention from Westminster. Almost half of people in the Republic said they#d match thator pay some of it . A third were totally opposed to doing so.But the £bn figure is disputed. It#s the UK statistical calculation that encompasses costs which nationalists believe wouldn#t transfer to a new united Ireland. Those costs include UK government debt interest, contributions to the UK armed forces and pension liabilities.!fordocument.querySelectortStill, Northern Ireland#s low cost of living and high number of public sector jobs will be extremely successful weaponsunionists are forced to do battle in a border poll.The jewel in the crown will of course be the NHS. Six in  voters here would be uncomfortable about transferring to the Republic#s health service.Changing it to a system similar to the NHS with free access and no prescription charges would surely be essential for nationalists in a future referendum. The British Treasury footing the bill during the pandemic for the furlough scheme also gives unionists strong ammunition.However, nationalists will be able to use Northern Ireland#s poor infrastructure, low wages, and very small private sector in their arguments. They will also suggest that considerable economic opportunities and potential investment could open up in the event of Irish unity.This poll gives Irish unity campaigners many reasons to pause for thought. Yet it also counters claims made by those who oppose constitutional change. The idea that the south doesn#t want the north is contradicted.More than two-thirds of people in the Republic support Irish unity with just % against.In Northern Ireland, there was a clear pro-Union lead - % to %, with % undecided.Some % of people here want a border poll compared to % opposed in the Republic two-thirds want one. Among referendum supporters, seven in  on both sides of the border want one now or within five years. Those figures suggest that the Taoiseach, who has dragged his feet on the issue and ruled out a border poll in coming years, is out of step with voters.The th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement in  is the date many nationalists are now speaking of for a referendum.The economic recovery of both the UK and the Republic post-pandemic will be key to the unity debate. If one state fares remarkably better than the other that will sway a signicant amount of Northern Ireland voters.Belfast Most ReadAstonishing antics of NI hospital medic revealed: Doctor Tsakov admits to lewd and racist outbursts and showing porn to colleaguesBobby Sands burial wishes ignored in favour of ‘political beneficial’ Belfast funeralFormer Fermanagh businessman James Balmer  charged with historical sexual abuseRevealed: the BBC NI presenters paid the most for external work‘Tough loss’ for Belfast as Holohans at the Barge restaurant announces closureTop VideosPlayWatch: Suzanne Breen gives her take on the DUP leadership racePlayPro-united Ireland poster removed from Divis Tower in Belfast PlayTrial of two veterans accused of IRA leader murder collapsesLatest The CentenaryThree young voices... why I feel Northern Irish, why I feel British and why I feel IrishCentenary poll: Public ided on terror amnesties as pardons for terrorists and troops leave people tornSuzanne BreenOpinionNorthern Ireland#s a powderkeg... but will of people must always prevailCentenary poll: #Irish unity would jeopardise peace in Northern Ireland# - survey confirms hardening of views in unionist communityCentenary poll: People from NI more likely to cross Irish border than southern counterparts LatestKate promises to turn up in pink dress for four-year-old MilaGrim outlook as more May snow set to give way to a wet and windy weekendFull-timeto work unlikely for more than one million staffBritish and Irish Lions pen picsDogs, snow and a polling station in a car boot among unusual voting day sights,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Those who favour a united Ireland have responded in a number of ways to this situation:Deny the figures - yes, about £bn of the transfer is an attributing to NI of spending done by the UK central government . But, in a united Ireland surely some of such spending would continue Claim taxes could rise - they could, but, as this poll shows, there would be considerable opposition to that, especially in the Republic.Claim public spending in NI could be scaled back - it is one thing to argue our public sector is too large in relative terms, but any sudden adjustment would probably provoke a major recession. Claim a united Ireland could out-grow the problem - true, in recent years the Republic#s economic growth rate has surpassed that in NI, even discounting the tax-avoiding behaviour of multinationals, but can we really assume that unity per se would have a sudden transformative impact on NI#s economic performance Claim that the Dublin government could borrow to keep NI afloat - at the moment, interest rates are very low, but that won#t always be true.Argue that the UK Government would leave its cheque book behind - in the s, the London government wrote off the Irish Free State#s obligation for part of the UK#s public debt, but can we really imagine a UK government being so generous as to wipe out debt and continue to pay for some welfare benefitsand subsidise NI#s infrastructure To be fair, this existence of the big fiscal deficit is also problematic for unionists. They could claim other UK regions have deficits. They do, but none are so large. They could try to argue this is a form of UK solidarity payment, but will that really wash with taxpayers in south-east England The biggest danger is that a long-term dependency on subsidy from Great Britain has actually distorted economic behaviour. As RHI exemplied, free money trumps making necessary reforms.One particularly interesting area of Northern Ireland-Republic comparisons is healthcare: a major focus of the Kantar Belfastpoll.The south uses a mixture of state provision and private insurance. The polling response shows a very strong preferences in NI to continue with the NHS model. That said, the advantages of free at the point of use are blunted by our ening waiting lists.OECD data implies healthcare spending per person in the Republic now exceeds that in NI and the UK average.Of course, as indicated by US experience, very high spending does not necessarily bring better quality. We know the dference in Covid vaccination rates.To finish with a health analogy, for all its points of strength, the NI economy remains in need of intensive care - a period of recuperation, rather than a major constitutional shock is probably the priority.Dr Esmond Birnie is senior economist at Ulster UniversityBelfast Most ReadAstonishing antics of NI hospital medic revealed: Doctor Tsakov admits to lewd and racist outbursts and showing porn to colleaguesBobby Sands burial wishes ignored in favour of ‘political beneficial’ Belfast funeralFormer Fermanagh businessman James Balmer  charged with historical sexual abuseRevealed: the BBC NI presenters paid the most for external work‘Tough loss’ for Belfast as Holohans at the Barge restaurant announces closureTop VideosPlayWatch: Suzanne Breen gives her take on the DUP leadership racePlayPro-united Ireland poster removed from Divis Tower in Belfast PlayTrial of two veterans accused of IRA leader murder collapsesLatest The CentenaryThree young voices... why I feel Northern Irish, why I feel British and why I feel IrishCentenary poll: Public ided on terror amnesties as pardons for terrorists and troops leave people tornSuzanne BreenOpinionNorthern Ireland#s a powderkeg... but will of people must always prevailCentenary poll: #Irish unity would jeopardise peace in Northern Ireland# - survey confirms hardening of views in unionist communityCentenary poll: People from NI more likely to cross Irish border than southern counterparts LatestFormer John Lewis boss Paula Nickolds joins Sainsbury’sPolice back assessment that loyalist paramilitaries did not threaten port staffKate promises to turn up in pink dress for four-year-old MilaGrim outlook as more May snow set to give way to a wet and windy weekendFull-timeto work unlikely for more than one million staff,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

He outlined plans for a unionist convention ahead of next year#s election to maximise unionist representation.Read MorePoots vs Donaldson: Tale of the tape as DUP heavyweights square off for party leadership Read MoreNelson McCausland:OpinionDUP must recover its passion... and new leader has to deliverThe Agriculture Minister promised an extensive outreach programme across unionism and loyalism to address issues of marginalisation, disadvantage and to rebuild communities. He said that he would set up a pro-Union think-tank including civic and political figures to broaden support for the Union to avoid a border poll.He would engage in international outreach to better explain the unionist cause in Brussels, London and North America. Mr Poots confirmed that he would split the positions of DUP leader and First Minister as one person simply cannot do justice to both demanding jobs. Instead of acting as First Minister, he would oversee the work of a new ministerial team and the day-to-day running of the party. Vowing to transform it totally, he said he would put democracy back into the Democratic Unionist Party.He pledged to order an independent review of the DUP with a view to creating a new, fit-for-purpose modern political party. He also announced plans to reach out to the grassroots of the party and to attract new members.The Agriculture Minister, who is expected to remain in that posthe becomes leader, said he wanted to ensure the effective running of the Executive through constructive engagement, but he would challenge republican propaganda and shameless populism”.He said he would lead a campaign against the “undemocratic protocol”. He also pledged to bridge the gap, and ensure “effective collaboration”, between DUP representatives in the Assembly and at Westminster in all policy areas.Meanwhile, Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill has said she felt sorry for Arlene Foster over the way she was treated by her party colleagues. She repeated her view that misogyny played a part in the internal DUP revolt that forced Mrs Foster to resign as DUP leader. Ms O#Neill would not be drawn on who she would prefer to win the leadership contest between Edwin Poots and Sir Jeffrey Donaldson.However, she said her relationship with whoever emerged victorious had to be one that was based on mutual respect and delivering outstanding political commitments from the New Decade, New Approach deal to restore powersharing at Stormont, including Irish language legislation.She said: I am joint head of government, I want to work with the leader of unionism but that needs to be on the basis of mutual respect, it needs to be on the basis of delivering political commitments that have been made.We had three years of hiatus, we had a political agreement in New Decade, New Approach. There are many outstanding commitments that haven#t been delivered, some because of Covid, some because there hasn#t been a full agreement to deliver in terms timeframe.

The commission is a very progressive body and hearing a range of perspectives will be invaluable.There is so much work to do. If there’s a future referendum, people need to know what sort of Ireland they’re voting for.”Dr Hamilton said: “I am delighted that the SDLP have reached out beyond the usual political activists to people of faith like me. I didn’t hesitate for a second in agreeing to come on board.I will be sitting on the commission as a Christian minister, and not as an armchair politician.”Dr Hamilton said he would “be surprised”he didn’t face criticism for joining the commission. “Some people will struggle to understand why a former Presbyterian moderator would want to be part of a discussion on Irish unity,” he said.“It’s important to remember that Presbyterians weren’t always unionists. It may seem strange, and a bit unpalatable now, but historically Presbyterians have been on both sides of the constitutional question here. The United Irishmen were radical Presbyterians.”Askedhe was a unionist or a nationalist, the former moderator said: “The unionism I come from is being changed by what is happening in London and Edinburgh. The underpinnings of the Union are being challenged by a rising English nationalism. It’s no longer clear to me what a unionist is.Dr Hamilton may head a policy think-tank on the role of faith communities in a new Ireland. “The Catholic Church’s relationship with the Irish state has a dficulty history so this would be important  work,” he said.Other  members included ex-NIO political director Chris McCabe former joint leader of the Green Party NI, Professor John Barry Lilian Seenoi Barr of the North West Migrants Forum victims’ campaigner Jude Whyte and disabled rights’ activist Michaela Holywood.Former Policing Board vice-chair Denis Bradley civic activist Conor Houston Dublin barrister Brian Barrington and Northern Ireland’s former chief probation officer Breidge Gadd are also members.SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said: “This is the beginning of the real conversation about what type of society we want to be. Instead of platitudes and demands, the SDLP is rolling up our sleeves to work with people across our communities, to have the dficult conversations and to bring forward the practical detail that has been lacking from the constitutional debate.”Belfast Most ReadAstonishing antics of NI hospital medic revealed: Doctor Tsakov admits to lewd and racist outbursts and showing porn to colleaguesBobby Sands burial wishes ignored in favour of ‘political beneficial’ Belfast funeralFormer Fermanagh businessman James Balmer  charged with historical sexual abuseRevealed: the BBC NI presenters paid the most for external work‘Tough loss’ for Belfast as Holohans at the Barge restaurant announces closureTop VideosPlayWatch: Suzanne Breen gives her take on the DUP leadership racePlayPro-united Ireland poster removed from Divis Tower in Belfast PlayTrial of two veterans accused of IRA leader murder collapsesLatest PoliticsAnger over reports UK Government planning blanket Troubles amnestyBill WhiteOpinionThe seats that could decideScotland gets another vote on independenceEdwin Poots pledges to restore DUP’s fortunes as he publishes manesto Nelson McCauslandOpinionDUP must recover its passion... and new leader has to deliverJust % of people in Northern Ireland trust Executive over pandemic response, new poll suggestsLatestCoronavirus Northern Ireland: No deaths and  new cases reportedMeghan aide ‘tried to protect her father from media intrusion’Engineers and biologists join forces to reveal how seals evolved to swimFormer John Lewis boss Paula Nickolds joins Sainsbury’sPolice back assessment that loyalist paramilitaries did not threaten port staff,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

You’ve frustrated the hopes and dreams and aspirations of many workers and families who aspire to own their own homes.”Fine Gael and Fianna FÃ¡il are both to blame for the housing crisis. They rolled out the red carpet for these funds to swoop in to buy up family homes. They created the system  turbo-charged it for years, while opposing our plans to stop it. #homesnotinvestments @PearseDoherty pic sykxOdGK— Sinn FÃ©inMay , In response, Mr Varadkar said the Government believes in home ownership and is in the process of developing proposals for a “workable solution”.“It needs to be a solution that resolves this problem, but also needs to be a solution that doesn’t have unintended consequences,” he told the Dail.The Tanaiste added that investment funds “have a role to play” in the property market.“There are housing developments in this city, mainly apartment blocks, mainly high-density developments that would not have been builtthey haven’t got finance from investment funds,” he said.“They weren’t able to get funds from the banks, andthey had not been built, we’d have fewer apartments, higher rents, higher prices, and perhaps even more people at homelessness.”Mr Varadkar said that at present about % of the housing stock in Ireland is owned by investment funds, which is “much lower” than in other developed countries.“Their correct role is to finance the construction of developments, not to swoop in and buy housing estates or developments that are already substantially complete,” he said.“That’s what we need to change and that’s what the Government intends to change with the actions it’s going to take in the coming weeks.”He added that it would be “wrong to ban them outright”.The Tanaiste was also pressed on the matter by Social Democrats co-leader Roisin Shortall and People Before Profit’s Richard Boyd Barrett.Ms Shortall said Fine Gael and Fianna Fail were arguing over who was to blame for the country’s housing issues when both were to blame.“Fianna Fail crashed the housing market the first time round, and Fine Gael then let vulture funds loose on the carcass for a decade, with tax incentives and fast-track planning and now both parties have joined forces and have been destroying the housing market,” she said.She questioned whether anyone in Government had noticed that since  funds have spent four billion euro on residential property in this country.Fianna FÃ¡il crashed the housing market and Fine Gael let vulture funds loose on its carcass for a decade.Time for action, not lip service.The @SocDems are bringing forward a Bill today to end the practice of the State entering long-term leases with developers  investors. pic hSUINvLh— RÃ³isÃ­n ShortallMay , Responding, Mr Varadkar said: “What I think is ideologically extreme is the view from some, including as I understand the Social Democrats, that we should have outright bans on some forms of housing and outright bans on some forms of housing investment, I think that would be a mistake.”He added that he believed any such ban would result in less housing.PAMost ReadAstonishing antics of NI hospital medic revealed: Doctor Tsakov admits to lewd and racist outbursts and showing porn to colleaguesBobby Sands burial wishes ignored in favour of ‘political beneficial’ Belfast funeralRevealed: the BBC NI presenters paid the most for external workFormer Fermanagh businessman James Balmer  charged with historical sexual abuseBobby Sands ‘changed his mind’ over Belfast funeral before deathTop VideosPlayWatch: Suzanne Breen gives her take on the DUP leadership racePlayPro-united Ireland poster removed from Divis Tower in Belfast PlayTrial of two veterans accused of IRA leader murder collapsesLatest Republic of IrelandYouth support workers ‘stretched to the limit’ during CovidPoliticians north and south condemn Troubles ‘amnesty’ planMeeting of British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference to take place in JuneNew media regulator needs powers to order ‘swt takedown’ of harmful contentInvestment funds buying complete housing estates ‘unacceptable’ – TaoiseachLatestCoronavirus Northern Ireland: No deaths and  new cases reportedPop-up polling station set up in car boot after keyholder oversleepsEngland could stage remaining IPL games in September as counties contact ECBUnseasonal snow gives skiers a chance toto the slopesSing when you’re winning  Ed Sheeran joins the musicians who had a ball,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Loughshore Lingo, by poet and writer Antaacuten Oacute Daacutela an Riacute, contains more than  alphabetical entries documenting the unique phrases and sayings of Lough Neaghs western shores. A series of  local stories are also included in the book, which gives a flavour of the areas native wit and ability to find humour in all situations. Originally from Killetra, near The Loup, Oacute Daacutela an Riacute said the book is a unique linguistic record. “This essential book will be a godsend for anyone intending to visit this famed region, just a good stretch a the legs from the City of Derry,” he said. googletag.cmd.push “It may also cause those from the area covered to scratch their heads in disbelief at the way they speak to one another, but carry on regardless with a wry smile. “In a world of increasing homogenization, Loughshore Lingo will stand as a valuable and detailed record of the lingual idiosyncrasies to be found in one small part of Ulster. “It might also make you laugh until you cry, and hiccup until you eventually pass out.” Ballinderry is one of the Loughshore villages on which the book centres. The following is an extract from one of the books many tales A Toast to Eternal Rest. googletag.cmd.push “Two local wags were carefully navigating their way home after closing time having enjoyed the free-flowing hospitality of a neighbouring licensed premises,” it reads. “With a thirst for more drink upon them, they approached the darkened form of the parish pub, above which resided the sleeping proprietor and his family. “After throwing stones at his bedroom window, the two managed to waken the weary innkeeper. “We just wanted to tell you that poor John James has gone to his rest, they exclaimed with grief-laden voices. “The landlord expressed shock and dismay at such a turn of events and immediately rushed downstairs, whereupon he admitted the messengers and set them up a whiskey each.     “After a few respectable minutes of quiet reflection the pub owner decided to tackle the elephant in the room. “So, when did John James die  he tenderly enquired. “Die , said one, We never said he was dead, only that hed gone to his rest. He went to bed about an hour ago. “They didnt get to finish their drinks.” Loughshore Lingo is available to purchase on eBay, Facebook Marketplace and via the online shop of Rebel Voice magazine, priced at pound..  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

His daughter and SDLP Causeway Coast and Glens councillor, Helena Dallat OrsquoDriscoll, reflects on the past year.Just weeks before my fathers passing, with the COVID death toll rising, Northern Ireland had entered lockdown in a bid to limit the spread of coronavirus. The Health Minister, Robin Swann, had described the potential scale of the impending surge as being of biblical proportions and for the next year, people would live a new normal - no unnecessary journeys, no mixing with other households, working from homepossible and many other restrictions on daily le. Two days after the announcement of the restrictions, we were hit with the news that my father’s cancer treatment had met an unexpected twist and he had weeks to live. googletag.cmd.push Like many families in Northern Ireland, we were to care for and say goodbye to a loved one in lockdown. It is hard to believe that a year has passed since dad died, in some ways time has stood still. I think most families bereaved in the last year will be experiencing a similar feeling. A lack of closure comes with a lockdown death, especiallyrestrictions were at their height. Although a small number of us were privileged to be with dad at the moment he died, we missed the rituals that we had all come to expect as normal. googletag.cmd.push As a society, we have such a respect for the dead and the bereaved, regardless of culture or faith but COVID upended all those customs and comforting gestures. As was the case for many families, we had no wake and we were unable to keep his remains at home. We didn’t carry his coffin. The church was almost empty for his funeral. The only physical touch at his graveside was from our very immediate family. From that moment, I realised that, even as a mum of two tactile daughters, I had totally underestimated physical touch and how it comforts and modulates emotions.     Having no visitors in the months following a death also adds to the feeling of isolation and I have felt particularly for those who might be living in remote areas or who don’t have their families close by.  All things considered, we were one of the luckier families. Although there was a feeling of isolation and loneliness due to the restrictions, at least the conditions were sufficiently safe for us to be with dad at the end. Thanks to first-class medical care from his consultant, our GPs, district nurses, carers and our NI Hospice community hospice nurse, we were able to care for him at home. Our community hospice nurse, in particular, taught us invaluable lessons. We quickly learned about symptom assessment and pain relief but also the preciousness of le and how to let someone with so precious little time left live as fully as possible until the end. He also died with nothing important left unsaid. Many other families never got a chance to nurse or say goodbye to their loved ones because of COVID circumstances and I find that unimaginably heartbreaking. It was a first lesson in just how vital our hospice services are. However, despite their critical nature, their futures are frequently faced with uncertainty. The demands on our palliative and end-of-le care services are steadily increasing but funding has not kept pace. The present funding methodology is flawed and operates without evidence base or up-to-date benchmarks. Last week at Stormont, cross-party support was achieved for the inclusion of death, dying and bereavement in the Programme for Government and I very much welcome that. It is progress but we have a long way to go. We need to give much more sustainable support to our end-of-le care providers. We must not forget that these organisations are lting the burden from the NHS which is why core funding is so important. Given the exceptional nature of this year, there is also a need for additional mental health resources to help deal with COVID’s psychological toll, especially for those grieving in our rural areas and those who have a limited network of support. This pandemic has reminded us that palliative and end-of-le care is a vitally important part of our care system and I believe it has opened up an important conversation around dying and bereavement.  Grief is a normal, albeit sad and challenging, part of le. We will all experience the pain of losing a loved one at some point. However, I believe there is no doubt that the current pandemic has posed unprecedented challenges to the grieving process, setting the stage for more complex and prolonged reactions for many who have lost loved ones. My SDLP colleagues and I will continue to press for more sustainable provision for the dying and bereaved and call for urgent, additional resources to tackle the poor mental health some of our bereaved families are likely to suffer as a result of loss in what have been traumatic conditions.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

His daughter and SDLP Causeway Coast and Glens councillor, Helena Dallat OrsquoDriscoll, reflects on the past year.Just weeks before my fathers passing, with the COVID death toll rising, Northern Ireland had entered lockdown in a bid to limit the spread of coronavirus. The Health Minister, Robin Swann, had described the potential scale of the impending surge as being of biblical proportions and for the next year, people would live a new normal - no unnecessary journeys, no mixing with other households, working from homepossible and many other restrictions on daily le. Two days after the announcement of the restrictions, we were hit with the news that my father’s cancer treatment had met an unexpected twist and he had weeks to live. googletag.cmd.push Like many families in Northern Ireland, we were to care for and say goodbye to a loved one in lockdown. It is hard to believe that a year has passed since dad died, in some ways time has stood still. I think most families bereaved in the last year will be experiencing a similar feeling. A lack of closure comes with a lockdown death, especiallyrestrictions were at their height. Although a small number of us were privileged to be with dad at the moment he died, we missed the rituals that we had all come to expect as normal. googletag.cmd.push As a society, we have such a respect for the dead and the bereaved, regardless of culture or faith but COVID upended all those customs and comforting gestures. As was the case for many families, we had no wake and we were unable to keep his remains at home. We didn’t carry his coffin. The church was almost empty for his funeral. The only physical touch at his graveside was from our very immediate family. From that moment, I realised that, even as a mum of two tactile daughters, I had totally underestimated physical touch and how it comforts and modulates emotions.     Having no visitors in the months following a death also adds to the feeling of isolation and I have felt particularly for those who might be living in remote areas or who don’t have their families close by.  All things considered, we were one of the luckier families. Although there was a feeling of isolation and loneliness due to the restrictions, at least the conditions were sufficiently safe for us to be with dad at the end. Thanks to first-class medical care from his consultant, our GPs, district nurses, carers and our NI Hospice community hospice nurse, we were able to care for him at home. Our community hospice nurse, in particular, taught us invaluable lessons. We quickly learned about symptom assessment and pain relief but also the preciousness of le and how to let someone with so precious little time left live as fully as possible until the end. He also died with nothing important left unsaid. Many other families never got a chance to nurse or say goodbye to their loved ones because of COVID circumstances and I find that unimaginably heartbreaking. It was a first lesson in just how vital our hospice services are. However, despite their critical nature, their futures are frequently faced with uncertainty. The demands on our palliative and end-of-le care services are steadily increasing but funding has not kept pace. The present funding methodology is flawed and operates without evidence base or up-to-date benchmarks. Last week at Stormont, cross-party support was achieved for the inclusion of death, dying and bereavement in the Programme for Government and I very much welcome that. It is progress but we have a long way to go. We need to give much more sustainable support to our end-of-le care providers. We must not forget that these organisations are lting the burden from the NHS which is why core funding is so important. Given the exceptional nature of this year, there is also a need for additional mental health resources to help deal with COVID’s psychological toll, especially for those grieving in our rural areas and those who have a limited network of support. This pandemic has reminded us that palliative and end-of-le care is a vitally important part of our care system and I believe it has opened up an important conversation around dying and bereavement.  Grief is a normal, albeit sad and challenging, part of le. We will all experience the pain of losing a loved one at some point. However, I believe there is no doubt that the current pandemic has posed unprecedented challenges to the grieving process, setting the stage for more complex and prolonged reactions for many who have lost loved ones. My SDLP colleagues and I will continue to press for more sustainable provision for the dying and bereaved and call for urgent, additional resources to tackle the poor mental health some of our bereaved families are likely to suffer as a result of loss in what have been traumatic conditions.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The guidelines, spread over two documents, offer bespoke advice depending on the category of care setting involved. “I fully recognise the importance of visiting for those who are receiving care. I hope this guidance will be widely welcomed, said Mr Swann. “It is also important to remember that the threat from COVID- remains very real. Everyone has a vital role to play when it comes to safe visiting. That includes social distancing, hand hygiene and not visitingyou are feeling unwell yourself.      Visiting was only ever restricted because it was absolutely necessary to do so to protect patients and residents from the risk of transmission of SARS-CoV- virus and subsequent development of COVID- infection. Given the progress that has been made against the virus, the time is now right to take steps to carefully re-introduce visiting.

The bars had been planning to open for outdoor eating and drinking as part of the latest easing of Covid- restrictions. However, they have now been told that they cannot reopen due to guidelines what constitutes an outdoor space. The Department of Health said the general rule of thumb is that outdoor premises should not be more than % enclosed. The definition of enclosed and substantially enclosed comes from the smoke-free legislation from  and is directly referenced in the restriction regulations, a spokesperson said. This was the same definition that was in place since last July and is not part of the recent amendments which will allow outdoor hospitality to open from  April. googletag.cmd.push Among the local pubs impacted are the Magnet Bar at Culmore, Molly Malones in Ballymagroarty and the Happy Landing in Eglinton. They have had to inform customers that they will not be able honour bookings made for Friday. These pubs will now have to wait until May  when indoor bars will be allowed to reopen. Colin Neill, the chief executive of Hospitality Ulster, said the interpretation of regulations was far too stringent. The idea of outdoor [hospitality] being opened again is meaninglessonly a relatively small number of venues can actually make it work, he said. Many will have prepared for reopening by buying thousands of pounds worth of stock to replenish their empty bars, only to be told that their set up does not meet the regulations, despite being open to the same standard in previous failed reopening phases. googletag.cmd.push  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

This marks the latest stage of the easing of the coronavirus restrictions. Hospitality businesses can also reopen but must only operate outdoors, with table service and limited numbers per table. Gyms and swimming pools, including those based in leisure centres, can only open for inidual training or for one-to-one coaching with a personal trainer. Restrictions on meeting up outside have also been slightly further eased, with  people from three households allowed to meet in a private garden. Earlier closing times for takeaway businesses and off-licences have also been removed. googletag.cmd.push Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District Council, Cllr BrianTierney, has asked the public to support local businesses as more prepare to reopen today. He said that it has been an incredibly challenging year for so many businesses within the district, and he asked that the public do what they can to support them while also adhering to health guidelines. I know there will be many businesses across our city and district really excited to open their doors today after a turbulent and dficult past year. I hope that everyone will support those businesses in the weeks and months ahead as they try toto normality, said MayorTierney. googletag.cmd.push In doing so, I would ask everyone to please make sure theyre following the health guidelines in place including wearing a face mask where required and always maintaining social distancing. It really is brilliant to see businesses reopen, but we also have to be mindful that the COVID- virus is still in our community so the best way that we can help our local businesses is by following the guidelines while in stores and out and about.      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

In March , Derry City and Strabane District Councils planning committee refusedClanmil Housing Association permission to build a four-storey complex comprised of  apartments at Victoria Road. However, Clanmil appealed the decision and it has now been overturned. Local planning officers had described the location as ‘possibly the most dficult regeneration site’ in the city. However, the officers had recommended that councillors approve the application for the Victoria Road apartments as the application was ‘entirely compliant’. In their report, planning officers stated that they believed it would reinvigorate the riverfront land and put an end to anti-social behaviour at the site. googletag.cmd.push  Among the objections raised by councillors had been that there was no parking provided within the plans for the Victoria Road apartments. At the meeting in March , local councillors said they believed a parking ban ‘discriminated’ against people with disabilities. At last year’s meeting, Hugh Hegarty from the Victoria Park Residents Group said the apartment complex design looked like a ‘horric brutalist East German style eyesore’. Mr Hegarty said pollution and parking problems would be exacerbatedresidents were to park on Spencer Road and Duke Street. A lack of space in the area has already resulted in ‘hazardous parking’ on Victoria Road and he envisaged problems at the site with numerous couriers and taxis arriving. googletag.cmd.push In response, a representative for Clanmil said it is a ‘highly accessible’ location with bus stops and train travel nearby. The housing association claimed that the design respects the history of the site, the city’s shirt factory heritage and complements existing buildings. A report by the Planning Appeals Commission into the matter has now found that the objections were not sustained and overturned the decision to refuse planning permission. The decision to overturn the councils refusal decision has been criticised by local rail campaigners, Into the West. The land at Victoria Road was previously part of the Derry to Strabane railway line which closed in .     Into the West has been campaigning for the line to be reopened and they have described the decision to allow the apartment complex to be built on the site as a disaster. A building there will make it impossible to restore a railway line along that route in future – making it extremely unlikely we will ever see rail from Derry to Strabane or Letterkenny again, said Steve Bradley, chair of Into the West. Without a route to Strabane, there can be no direct rail services form Derry or Donegal to Dublin. And as Derry has a bigger population than every other town on the former Derry-Portadown rail route,our city can no longer be included in that proposed reopening then the viability of restoring rail to places like Omagh, Strabane, Enniskillen, Dungannon and Letterkenny also collapses. In short – building  apartments in that location will destroy any future for rail across the west of Ulster and prevent it being ed to Tyrone, Donegal and Fermanagh.

Planning officers have recommended refusing planning permission for the  new apartments within a six-storey building on a vacant plot on Northland Road between Clarence Avenue and the Magee campus of Ulster University. However, the final decision on the proposal rests with councillors on Derry City and Strabane District Councils planning committee. A decision had been deferred from last months meeting of the planning committee. The committee held its monthly meeting today and the Clarence Avenue plans were on the agenda. However, a decision on the apartments plans was again deferred until the committees meeting next month as a result of the amount of late information about the application which had been submitted to the planning department. googletag.cmd.push  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

He was speaking at a press briefing for the media in Donegal on Wednesday following the fallout from comments made by chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan last Friday about the high incidence of Covid- in the county. googletag.cmd.push There has been a backlash in Donegal to the tone of the comments Dr Holohan made when he said there were concerns about things happening in the county that “even the dogs on the street” know shouldn’t be happening. Figures released at the press briefing put the national incidence rate in the county at  cases per , people compared to a national rate of . The highest rates are in the Milford local electoral area at . and the Letterkenny area where the rate is .. The lowest rate in the county is in the Donegal LEA at .. The briefing was told there were  GP referrals for testing in the county on Tuesday, an increase of % on the same day last week. googletag.cmd.push Dr Glynn said the concerns were raised last week so that people can take protective measures and ensure the situation does not get worse. He said there is a bigger number of smaller clusters in Donegal than in other parts of the country. “It was not meant as blame. It certainly was not made as a threat,” he said. “It would be very strange for us to preside over a situation where incidence is very high and increasing in a county and not draw attention to that.” At the briefing, director of public health for the HSE in the north-west, Dr Anthony Breslin, highlighted a number of clusters that have occurred due to events in the county in recent weeks, including awake, a family gathering and an th birthday party.     The events resulted in dozens of cases and infections in workplaces, in families and at a school. One social gathering has been linked to  cases of Covid-, he said. Dr Glynn said that there are concerns about the situation in the county and that some people in Donegal have “pushed the boundaries”. “We are concerned about the current incidence. That is not to say that Donegal has not come a very long way over the past number of months, just as the rest of the country has, and that can only have happened because the majority of people are trying to do the right thing,” he said. “This is not in any way a reflection on the majority but clearly there are a number of incidents where people have pushed the boundaries. “We have seen that in other counties, it is not just in Donegal. But I suppose the dference at the moment versus some other places where we have particularly high incidences, is that there are large clusters driving incidences. “In Donegal, it seems to be a little bit more widespread with a bigger number of smaller clusters which makes it that little bit harder to control. Sowe can continue to emphasise, andwe can get people who have been pushing the boundaries a little bit just to comply that bit more over the coming weeks, we should see incidence drop quickly in Donegal.” He said we can not get away from the fact that the high incidence rates in parts of the county are due to the fact the disease is being transmitted from person to person. “It gets transmitted from person to person when people come into contact with one another and when for whatever reason masks are not worn, distance is not kept, people who are symptomatic don’t self-isolate. “Right now we are seeing a higher incidence in Donegal than we have in other parts of the country and in that regard, it is incumbent on us as doctors to point out our concerns so that people can take proactive actions because there are many people who remain very vulnerable to this disease over the coming weeks,” he said. “All we are asking people in Donegal to do is to protect themselves and their families. We are not proposing any dferent measures for any one part of Donegal as things currently stand, and I would be hopeful and optimistic given the level of engagement over the past number of days that we wont be looking at some sort of additional measures for the county or any part of the county over the coming weeks.” He said the priority for people over the coming weeks is to meet people outside. “As far as is possible at all, do not meet up with friends or extended families or do not have parties inside. Inside gives this virus such an advantage in terms of transmission,” he said. “Last January Donegal had an incidence of , per ,. It is now  per ,. It is the highest in the country but it’s an order of magnitude lower than where it was and that’s down to the work of the majority doing most of the right things most of the time.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Grade A listed building also known as ‘The People’s Hall,’ was the venue of choice for some of the world’s most iconic performers and notaries after it was built in . But how many people nowadays know that its remarkable guests included both Emmeline Pankhurst and Eleanor Marx   Emmeline Pankhurstwas the leader of the radical suffragette movement that played a key role in helping to win British women the right to vote. googletag.cmd.push She was founder of the Women’s Social and Political Union and gave a rousing speech in St Columb’s Hall on th October . Eleanor Marx, the daughter of German socialist revolutionary Karl Marx, organised a trade union recruitment drive for Derry’s mainly female factory workers in St Columb’s Hall on th November , just five years after the distinctive venue was built at Orchard Street within the Walled City. Friends of the Factories  “in solidarity with” Derry Trades Union Council, organised the placement of two plaques side by side to coincide with events to mark May Day weekend, the annual celebration of workers and union rights across the world. googletag.cmd.push The plaque erected in memory of Emmeline Pankhurst was a tribute shared with Margaret Cousins, the Irish and Indian suffragettewho attended Victoria High School in Derry. Co-founder of the Irish Women’s Franchise League, Dublin in , she was credited with organising and inviting Pankhurst to speak at St Columb’s Hall in . The plaque dedicated to Eleanor Marx who visited the Hall almost  years before Pankhurst, reads: “Eleanor Marx, Fighter for socialism and women’s rights . In this hall, th November , Eleanor launched a recruitment drive for women and general workers previously excluded from most union activity.     The organisation of Derry shirt factory workers was a key moment in the development of trades unionism in Britain and Ireland.” Yvonne Norris, local campaigner with Friends of the Factories , said: “Friends of the Factories came together at the most dficult of times, united in doing something positive by contributing to the legacy of the factory workers and their contribution to the City. I have been honoured to be part of an initiative made up of so many formidable women, driven by women and achieved by women. We thank the Derry Trades Union Council for their unwavering support of our project, it has got us to the point we have reached today. As well as the ceremony in honour of the two female revolutionary thinkers who addressed rallies in St Columb’s Hall, plaques to honour the legacy of the workers were also unveiled at a number of former shirt factory sites including Welch Margeston, Sinclair, Ebrington, Rosemount, Hogg  Mitchell and the City Factory. Anne-Marie Gallagher, Project Director of St Columb’s Hall, said she was delighted that the roles of three illustrious women historically associated with the venue, had finally been etched into the fabric of the building more than a century later. She said: “These beautul plaques are very much in keeping with the character of the Hall and add to the already vibrant story of Derry’s built heritage and history. The fact that these remarkable women left such a lasting legacy is very poignant, especially to think that they were standing in here over  years ago. “We are thankful to Friends of the Factories and Derry Trades Union Council for their foresight and determination in shining the spotlight on the somewhat lesser-known connections with this building’s rich history to the wider world.” St Columb’s Hall is located on the East Wall of the city’s historic Walls and was originally built in  by the St Columb’s Hall Total Abstinence Society as part of the Temperance movement. Now used as a noted conference and events venue, the building is currently in the midst of a major regeneration project.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

While a student in St Patricks Maghera, she played on the schools first Ladies Gaelic Football team. She is a walking advocate for ladies sport, getting involved and trying to promote it.There is no hiding her enthusiasm. A break from her studies to talk all things football lts the lid on her sporting knowledge and an obvious passion for the exciting developments at Draperstown Celtic.“Sport is great, not just for the physical aspect, but there are the mental health benefits too,” explains Niamh.Student le in Belfast gave her an opportunity to try her hand at soccer with Queens, something she had longed to do. A grand-daughter of former Draperstown Celtic player Malachy McGuigan, Niamh qualied as a Level  coach in the autumn and is now coaching the underage players in the clubs Diamonds Ladies team and is part of the recently formed senior team. googletag.cmd.push Niamh, back row second from right, pictured before a QUB game. Her placement has already been secured in the Dublin branch of international pharmaceutical giants Alexion secured for next year. Sunday mornings are the perfect getaway from the stresses of revision.“I even had an exam on a Monday and I went to DC on Sunday, the buzz you get ,lts your mood so much...that escape from everything ,” Niamh points out.Her camogie career took her up the underage ranks to senior level. An injury forced her out of action and with her A-Levels on the horizon, study took preference.With no soccer clubs on her doorstep, travelling to Cookstown-based Mid Ulster Ladies wasnt feasible.“It was a great team and they were lovely there, but I just couldnt balance it,” Niamh adds. “Now I have got involved with DC, it is only down the road and my Granny and Granda live in Draperstown.”It wasnt until the age of  that she began her soccer career with Queens.“I just thought I have the opportunity now to start something I wanted, I joined their team in  and I havent looked back since,” Niamh points out.“Every evening, you were looking forward to training. You make friends for le and it is such a great sport.”When Chairman Paul McCallion floated the idea of a ladies team in Draperstown, she jumped at the chance. There was no second thought required.“I want to give the younger ones the opportunity from that age to be able to play football instead of waiting until they are . The atmosphere around DC, you couldnt get nicer people,” Niamh enthused. googletag.cmd.push COACHING Despite having her coaching qualication tucked away, the sporting lockdown kept her itching to get started. Enthusiasm morphed into frustration.“I was raging because there was no sport and I wanted to get straight out into it,” Niamh adds.“For me, coaching is so rewarding. Even when you are taking the session, at the start the players are a bit timid, but by the end of the session, especially the young ones, you can see how much they have progressed. For me, that gives me a real buzz.”“They are playing with their own age group,with girls. Through the years, theyll build a team with each other. “I have learned so much from the last two years, so imagine young girls learning the game from a young age. The love of the game and even building a team with each other.”In her younger days, she remembers her Granda Malachy taking her to the St Colms Draperstown school and Ballinascreen camogie teams he was involved in. There is a photo doing the rounds of a young Niamh, as a mascot, perched at the front of a team photo.Niamhs love for soccer came from watching the US womens national team and their promotion of the game. The Los Angeles based Angel City team, starting up in , will be the th team in the National Womens Soccer League.     Tobin Heath inspired Niamhs interest in football.  “When you look at the US team, they are a successful team with big players like Tobin Heath. She is such somebody I would look towards,” Niamh adds.Her engineering background comes to the fore as she number crunches the rise of the game. The most watched game, the USAs - win over Holland in the  World Cup Final had an increase of  percent in just four years.Add in the Northern Ireland ladies qualication for a first ever European Womens Championships. Local heroes. Niamh was starstruck when Northern Ireland ladies captain Marissa Callaghan came to DC Diamonds first senior session recently.“Those are the types of people, idols youd want to be, those you see on the TV,” Niamh said, while remembering some of the advice.“Marissa told us to aim to play on the Northern Ireland team. It is about having expectations and always wanting to better yourself....dont doubt yourself.”The first session brought excitement. Others have declared an interest in joining the senior squad, coached by Chloe McPeake and Alice Bradley. Niamh will also weigh in with a helping hand.“It was such a great session, they had it down to a tee,” Niamh stated. “It was a fun session, we played a fun and competitive game. There is a balance, it is recreational and there is a chance to play more seriously.”Niamh urges others to come along. The door is open to everyone.“I have made friends for le, people from America and England and just down the road,” she concludes of her soccer involvement so far.“Even the confidence you get from being on a team, you build so much as a person and you are out there getting fit. It is a great release.“It is a bit of fun and it can be competitiveyou want. It is about getting out there, enjoying the game, the great game that it is.” The Draperstown Celtic Senior Diamonds train every Sunday morning at .am at the Back Row G pitch in Draperstown.

While a student in St Patricks Maghera, she played on the schools first Ladies Gaelic Football team. She is a walking advocate for ladies sport, getting involved and trying to promote it.There is no hiding her enthusiasm. A break from her studies to talk all things football lts the lid on her sporting knowledge and an obvious passion for the exciting developments at Draperstown Celtic.“Sport is great, not just for the physical aspect, but there are the mental health benefits too,” explains Niamh.Student le in Belfast gave her an opportunity to try her hand at soccer with Queens, something she had longed to do. A grand-daughter of former Draperstown Celtic player Malachy McGuigan, Niamh qualied as a Level  coach in the autumn and is now coaching the underage players in the clubs Diamonds Ladies team and is part of the recently formed senior team. googletag.cmd.push Niamh, back row second from right, pictured before a QUB game. Her placement has already been secured in the Dublin branch of international pharmaceutical giants Alexion secured for next year. Sunday mornings are the perfect getaway from the stresses of revision.“I even had an exam on a Monday and I went to DC on Sunday, the buzz you get ,lts your mood so much...that escape from everything ,” Niamh points out.Her camogie career took her up the underage ranks to senior level. An injury forced her out of action and with her A-Levels on the horizon, study took preference.With no soccer clubs on her doorstep, travelling to Cookstown-based Mid Ulster Ladies wasnt feasible.“It was a great team and they were lovely there, but I just couldnt balance it,” Niamh adds. “Now I have got involved with DC, it is only down the road and my Granny and Granda live in Draperstown.”It wasnt until the age of  that she began her soccer career with Queens.“I just thought I have the opportunity now to start something I wanted, I joined their team in  and I havent looked back since,” Niamh points out.“Every evening, you were looking forward to training. You make friends for le and it is such a great sport.”When Chairman Paul McCallion floated the idea of a ladies team in Draperstown, she jumped at the chance. There was no second thought required.“I want to give the younger ones the opportunity from that age to be able to play football instead of waiting until they are . The atmosphere around DC, you couldnt get nicer people,” Niamh enthused. googletag.cmd.push COACHING Despite having her coaching qualication tucked away, the sporting lockdown kept her itching to get started. Enthusiasm morphed into frustration.“I was raging because there was no sport and I wanted to get straight out into it,” Niamh adds.“For me, coaching is so rewarding. Even when you are taking the session, at the start the players are a bit timid, but by the end of the session, especially the young ones, you can see how much they have progressed. For me, that gives me a real buzz.”“They are playing with their own age group,with girls. Through the years, theyll build a team with each other. “I have learned so much from the last two years, so imagine young girls learning the game from a young age. The love of the game and even building a team with each other.”In her younger days, she remembers her Granda Malachy taking her to the St Colms Draperstown school and Ballinascreen camogie teams he was involved in. There is a photo doing the rounds of a young Niamh, as a mascot, perched at the front of a team photo.Niamhs love for soccer came from watching the US womens national team and their promotion of the game. The Los Angeles based Angel City team, starting up in , will be the th team in the National Womens Soccer League.     Tobin Heath inspired Niamhs interest in football.  “When you look at the US team, they are a successful team with big players like Tobin Heath. She is such somebody I would look towards,” Niamh adds.Her engineering background comes to the fore as she number crunches the rise of the game. The most watched game, the USAs - win over Holland in the  World Cup Final had an increase of  percent in just four years.Add in the Northern Ireland ladies qualication for a first ever European Womens Championships. Local heroes. Niamh was starstruck when Northern Ireland ladies captain Marissa Callaghan came to DC Diamonds first senior session recently.“Those are the types of people, idols youd want to be, those you see on the TV,” Niamh said, while remembering some of the advice.“Marissa told us to aim to play on the Northern Ireland team. It is about having expectations and always wanting to better yourself....dont doubt yourself.”The first session brought excitement. Others have declared an interest in joining the senior squad, coached by Chloe McPeake and Alice Bradley. Niamh will also weigh in with a helping hand.“It was such a great session, they had it down to a tee,” Niamh stated. “It was a fun session, we played a fun and competitive game. There is a balance, it is recreational and there is a chance to play more seriously.”Niamh urges others to come along. The door is open to everyone.“I have made friends for le, people from America and England and just down the road,” she concludes of her soccer involvement so far.“Even the confidence you get from being on a team, you build so much as a person and you are out there getting fit. It is a great release.“It is a bit of fun and it can be competitiveyou want. It is about getting out there, enjoying the game, the great game that it is.” The Draperstown Celtic Senior Diamonds train every Sunday morning at .am at the Back Row G pitch in Draperstown.

Thatrsquos not the same as having a formal British Irish Intergovernmental Conference with officials and an agenda, he said.ldquoI have no objectionthey want to talk every day. Thatrsquos a good idea, but I think the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement should be followed and that means there should be a BIIC on a regular and frequent basis. That is what was signed.Speaking weeks after street violence by loyalist protesters erupted in Belfast over issues related to Brexit and the NI Protocol, Mr Ahern said BIIC meetings were very important.ldquoIt does concern me that we havenrsquot had a British Irish Intergovernmental Conference for a long, long time, maybe a few years.Mr Ahern was interviewed by former BBC political correspondent Martina Purdy and former barrister Elaine Kelly, who spoke to the former Taoiseach about peace-building, faith and St Patrick.ldquoThe two governments, the British and Irish governments are the custodians of the Agreement. They are not meeting to discuss these issues. That clearly is not in line with the agreement.ldquoI am not using any other words than what the Agreement usedhellip The agreement says that there must be frequent meetings and you know that should be happening.ldquoThey donrsquot have to be for long. They can be on zoom, Microsoft teams anything you like. They should be having these meetings and where there are dficulties they should be dealing with at those meetings.ldquoIn the absence of those meetings, things can drt. Quite frankly I donrsquot understand why those meetings canrsquot take place.ldquoI donrsquot expect the British Prime Minister and the Taoiseach to have a meeting all day ndash they donrsquot have to do that. They could have a meeting for an hour and half. Thatrsquos not going to kill anybody.He said other officials or ministers or institutions within departmental structures could then follow through with the issues.Mr Ahern also spoke about the future of the Catholic Church in Ireland, where he said there must be more involvement of the laity.He said his faith was important to him. ldquoYou donrsquot want to overplay it because you are attacked nowyou do that.ldquoReligion is important to me. I am a believer and I understand it and I read about it and I think itrsquos part of my le and I often think that a lot of people, who have a lot of problems and dficulties - it is because they donrsquot have it. All I can do is pray for them.During lockdown Mr Ahern shared how he went to mass regularly from his kitchen in Drumcondra, sharing masses online from Clonard monastery in Belfast, as well as Derry, Cork and Dublin.He said lockdown had given people time to reflect and enjoy walking, something he really enjoys.He told the podcasters mdash former Sisters of Adoration who are now pilgrim guides on Saint Patrickrsquos Way Downpatrick mdash that ldquohe would love to come and walk the Irish Camino with them.He revealed he had spent nine months of the lockdown reading The Annals of the Four Masters, chronicles of medieval Irish history.Mr Ahern described it as a ldquotough read, admitting he could only manage  pages a day.Asked what he would like to banish from Ireland, in the Spirit of St Patrick, he said ldquoinjustice and violence..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5May2021-Breast.jpg","title":"Breastfeeding is the most beautiful thing  ","story":"WHEN Joanne Masseyrsquos second child, Edward, was born six months ago, she knew she wanted to breastfeed him, but also,possible, donate to the milk bank.Weighing in at just over lbs, Edward fed for  minutes soon after he was born and it seemed like establishing feeding would be no problem.However, a few months before Edward was born, Joannersquos family found out her father, Jim Watson, had cancer.She explained: ldquoEventually we would learn it was terminal. So my stress levels were abnormally high.ldquoI soon felt like I couldnrsquot feed Edward enough, stress got the better of me at times and my brilliant health visitor Maura pointed me to a local breastfeeding group and also another brilliant lady, my breastfeeding peer support worker Aine Jordan-Doxey, who just completely gave me the confidence and support to keep going.ldquoThe peer breastfeeding group is hosted by a midwe health visitor and contains a beautul bunch of souls who are just there for each other. Wersquore all in the same boat and through this group I have received many tips, tricks and even friends.Despite Joannersquos determination to breastfeed Edward, it wasnrsquot all plain sailing.ldquoBreastfeeding is just the most beautul thing.Yes it can be dficult and absolutely frustrating at times but the benefits far outweigh those short blips, she said.ldquoThe best advice Irsquove ever heard mdash lsquodonrsquot give up on a bad dayrsquo.On a rough day, breastfeeding Edward gave me comfort, knowing I was the reason he is full and happy made me feel so good.ldquoAine gave me so much advice, including certain foods to eat to boost milk supply. Oats, theyrsquore your best friend! And you cannot drink enough water.Soon Joanne had more milk that Edward could take so she began collecting extra milk for the milk bank.She said: ldquoThe bottles arrived and I filled the first ml on December  last year. The donation was nearly full in a month but sadly my dad passed away on January  at the age of . There was a few weeks with no donations as my milk supply ped to an all-time low. Itrsquos just incredible what stress can do to your body.ldquoWell, Aine was there again, checking in, keeping me in chat, and keeping me motivated to keep breastfeeding. I am very lucky to have a wonderful, supportive husband, a close knit family and a close circle of best friends who have been tremendous during this very dficult time.Joanne went on to complete her donation of four litres of milk she calls ldquoliquid gold on Motherrsquos Day and wants to thank Aine for all her help and support.She said: ldquoI fully support every motherrsquos choice to either breastfeed or bottle-feed butanyone was struggling to breastfeed I would strongly recommend taking the support thatrsquos available.ldquoPersonally I am continuing to breastfeed because it gives me a little comfort in this time of grief, itrsquos a moment where I just look into his eyes and feel so needed and loved. So not only for the instantly available nutrition and comfort to my son but for those moments of joy I get from it too.Aine says she is so proud of Joanne mdash not only for continuing to breastfeed during the emotional time of her fatherrsquos illness and death but also for contributing four litres of milk to the Trustrsquos milk bank.The mother-of-threersquos own experience of breastfeeding had been rewarding but also not without its challenges.While she was living in England at the time, she recalled a time when one of her children was not thriving while she was feeding them.ldquoMy doctor and my health visitor both told me to stop breastfeeding my son and it was so frustrating as I knew that was not the problem so I continued on and it turned out that there was something  wrong.She began supporting Joanne in November last year when Edward was five weeks old.ldquoJoanne was exhausted and had been through some dficult nights where Edward wasnrsquot sleeping and was screaming through the night.I remember speaking with her about developmental leaps and what to expect at this stage and the normal infant sleep patterns, said Aine.ldquoFrom the beginning I could tell Joanne had so much passion for breastfeeding and wanted to succeed in every way. Joanne began expressing enough to give Edward a bottle and soon after he started sleeping better, just in time for her toddler to stop sleeping through. Joanne never let this stop her and carried on with minimal sleep.Aine said that when Joanne first mentioned to her about the possibility of donating milk, there were only  donors on the Northern Ireland milk bank.She said ldquoI was so proud as Joanne was the first of my mums to donate and it honestly made me smile at the thought. As usual Joanne just laughed and said it was no big deal as she enjoyed it. It was the first time I disagreed with her as I thought she was doing an extraordinary thing.ldquoWhen I opened her message and saw Edward surrounded by four litres of expressed milk for the milk bank, I was blown away again. What an incredible gt for the sick babies in theneonatal units.ldquoNot only was Joanne potty training a toddler and breastfeeding on demand, but she was expressing for the milk bank. I am so thankful to have been a part of her journey. So often there isnrsquot enough support available for mums especially with breastfeeding, and Covid made it more dficult as the usual support groups had all closed. Thatrsquos why peer support is so valuable as it provides one to one support for mums at the most important time.Aine highlighted the need for support for breastfeeding mums. ldquoWe need to be offering all mums support from the very first chance which is the case for a lot, but sometimes mums donrsquot know about us until itrsquos too late. ldquoI am thankful to Joanne for sharing this experience with me and I know we will still be in touch for a long time.ldquoAnd even though Irsquom sure she will downplay what she has achieved, I can honestly say I am so proud of her and all her hard work.Mothers can be referred to the Trustrsquos breastfeeding support worker through midwery and health visiting services..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5May2021-Carlisle.jpg","title":"Carlisle’s staff in charity hike in memory of much loved Pat  ","story":"ONE hundred staff and friends at Carlislersquos in Ballynahinch are each walking five miles this week on a sponsored walk in honour of a much-loved colleague who died last month.Pat Greene, who was from Saintfield, died on April , much to the shock and sorrow of everyone at the business.The  year-old had worked for Carlislersquos for  years, starting off as a coal boy, going on to work in all areas of the business and finishing as a work supervisor.Donna Carlisle explained that Pat loved The Proclaimers song Irsquom Gonna Beand it inspired the charity effort from staff members, past and present, and their partners.ldquoIt was Patrsquos favourite song and it had to be on the playlist at all our party nights when we raised money for ious cancer charities. Raising money for these charities was always important to Patrick as his mother sadly passed away from the disease when he was young, she said.ldquoHe never missed any of the parties and when The Proclaimers came on I always remember Pat taking centre stage and all of us had to follow him and his actions and it was always very important we did it right.ldquoThis is one memory of Pat we will never forget. We think it is very fitting that between us all we will walk those  miles for our friend and colleague whilst raising much needed funds for Cancer Focus NI in his name.The walkers aim to complete the  miles by Sunday, having started last Sunday.Mrs Carlisle praised her late colleague as a person who was ldquouniversally liked.ldquoI honestly never heard one bad word said about Pat. He was just one of those members of staff you just loved to have around you, she said. ldquoHe was brilliant, did anything and always tried to keep everyone right. He was always there and became part of the furniture, as they say.ldquoHe really became a friend over the years and he will be sorely missed by us all.Money will be raised through staff sponsorship and JustGiving donation on Carlislersquos Facebook page. Contributions can also be left into the Belfast Road shop in Ballynahinch.Carlislersquos Fuels have donated  litres of oil while Carlislersquos Food SuperValu is donating pound worth shopping vouchers for a prize draw for everyone who donates.The draw will take place on Monday, May , and winners will be contacted by Facebook page or telephone.

Finally after a long layoff we can resume a bit of normality in our outdoor beer garden, Mr Murphy said. ldquoWe have installed a new bar outside to coincide with the rules that are still in place and we have enjoyed creating a new look premises for the locals to enjoy, he continued.ldquoWe have missed many things but none more so than our loyal customers.Whilst soaking in the busy atmosphere, customer Sarah Taggart said: ldquoItrsquos been a long five months, I have missed the craic and seeing the dferent people around the bar. It is great to be back.Denvirrsquos also enjoyed greeting their customers, who enjoyed a meal and drinks in the beer garden.Co-owner Chris Dagens said: ldquoAfter a long time away, we can finally see our customers again. Itrsquos fantastic to see so many familiar people who we have greatly missed and long may it continue.The establishment has also been using the lsquoB expressrsquo mobile app in the beer garden so customers can order from their table and reduce further contact.ldquoThe app is great, itrsquos convenient for customers and makes it so much easier to get their orders to their tables at the fastest time.

However, he did not make it through to show his impressive main course and dessert to the judges.Both chefs threw their all into devising four courses, including an appetiser and pre-dessert mdash based on the theme celebrating British innovation.Hopes were high for East Down given that Dundrum chef Alex Browne Greene, from EIPIC restaurant in Belfast, got two dishes to the national final last year and narrowly missed out on being crowned champion of champions at the banquet.Gemmarsquos starter was a twist on gammon, egg and chips, inspired by Kegomatic from Queenrsquos University students and for her fish course, the innovation shown in the building of the Titanic inspired her sea bass fish dish.She used William Clannyrsquos invention of the safety lamp for miners for her main course of lamb and the influence of astronomer Alice Everett as the first woman to work for the Royal Observatory to inspire her dessert, Out of this World.The dessert was her favourite course and she was delighted to have been scored a ten by chef Daniel Clford.ldquoIrsquom known for my desserts so I was really delighted to have got that score from Daniel, said Gemma.ldquoI also took his advice on my main course as therersquos no better person to take advice from and generally scaled back my dishes and made them more refined as the comments back were that there was too much on the plate.While Gemma was proud to have made it through to the regional final, she said she was not disappointed at not going through to the national judging.ldquoTo be honest, it was a bit of a relief as I did not know how I was going to go up against all the other chefs in the national final as I have only been cheffing for seven years and am mostly self-taught, she revealed.Gemma went into the competition, which was filmed last November, full of confidence and determined to do her best.ldquoI think I just went into a zone and concentrated on my own dishes and not to get too caught up in what the other chefs were doing, she said.ldquoPhelim was brilliant on the day and deserved to win and I remember saying on the programme that the better chef won. I hope that he goes on to get a dish to the banquet.While she has been receiving fantastic customer feedback from her popup, A Peculiar Tea, which she has been operating during the lockdowns, Gemma admitted that cooking was not her first career choice.ldquoWhen I left school I actually went to Queenrsquos University to do a nursing degree but a medical issue I experienced meant that I couldnrsquot complete it, she said.She then studied Bio Medical Sciences for a while before going to Ulster University to complete a software engineering degree.Her love of food and cooking mdash inspired by her chef mother mdash was strictly a hobby until the age of  when she took her first job at Slims Kitchen on the Lisburn Road in Belfast where she cut her teeth for a year while doing a Culinary Masters course.For four years Gemma continued studying and working full-time at a iety of great establishments, such as the Fitzwilliam Hotel in Belfast where she rose to head pastry chef, before moving The Old Inn, Crawfordsburn, where she worked all the sections and eventually became sous chef.She has been in Alexanders for the last two years and got the opportunity to become an owner last year.ldquoIt may have taken my several attempts before I found the right career but I was determined not to do any job that I did not absolutely love and was passionate about.Like Gemma, Brunels chef Paul Cunningham hopes to be invited back next year after his disappointing showing this year.The  year-old had hoped to get to the regional judging to please his six-year-old daughter, Farrah.ldquoFarrah and I are massive fans of the show, we watch every year and of course, I wanted to further than I did but Irsquove got over the disappointment now and concentrating on getting the restaurant ready for re-opening, Paul told the Recorder.Paul is known for only using local produce from within a -mile radius of Newcastle and foraging for herbs and plants.His menu reflected his locality and passion for pioneers including Belfast-born Dame Jocelyn Bell Burnell and Isambard Kingdom Brunelrsquos refloating of the SS Great Britain in Dundrum Bay mdash an incident which led him to name his restaurant by the great engineer.Paul only got to cook his starter and main course on the show but said his main course and dessert were showstoppers, with the main course of lamb called Healthy Heart made without using any salt or butter, inspired by Frank Pantridge who invited the portable defibrillator.He also collaborated with Doran Precision Engineering to create a model of the Titanic for one of his dishes and a special dish to show off his dessert, the Atom Smasher, inspired by Dame Jocelyn Bell Burnell..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5May2021-Condemnation.jpg","title":"Condemnation over Murlough vandalism  ","story":"LOCAL politicians have criticised vandals responsible for setting fire to a gate at the Murlough Nature Reserve two weekends ago as  firefighters were battling a huge blaze in the nearby Mournes.The vandals also left behind a trail of rubbish at the internationally acclaimed area with their actions condemned by South Down MLA Colin McGrath and Mournes councillor Laura Devlin.They say it ldquobeggars belief that while the raging wildfire destroyed  acres of rich habitat across the Mournes, there were people who thought that it was appropriate to start a fire at the Nature Reserve.The politicians also revealed that National Trust staff had to remove  bags of rubbish from the Reserve location on the Sunday the fire in the Mournes was eventually extinguished.Cllr Devlin said as young people drank alcohol and watched the blaze raging across the mountains, they set fire to a pedestrian gate which is also used to prevent Exmore ponies at the Reserve from escaping.ldquoI am really shocked at this behaviour, she said. ldquoBy the Saturday evening, everyone in the locality had an idea of the widespread damage in the Mournes but these iniduals thought it appropriate to cause more damage and potentially risk another blaze.ldquoI have no idea who these iniduals were and how old they are so I am appealing to people young and old.

We have competed a lot together and Irsquove developed my skills with him a lot, we have picked up six or seven wins this season together he said.ldquoThat horse has helped me get to the grade one stage of racing, especially after our massive grade two win.That grade two success was when Danny and Nuts Well secured first place in the valuable Old Roan at Aintree. Nuts Well was picked for an outsider in the race at  , but the talented rider once again showed he was worth his salt as he galloped to glory.This gave Northumberland trainer Ann Hamilton her biggest success to date as they claimed the pound, prize pot.Despite his interest and success in racing, Danny was the first in his family to become heavily involved in the sport.ldquoI come from a sporting background in my family, my two brothers played Gaelic football and soccer growingup, but I was the one who took it upon myself to get into the horses, he said.ldquoOf course my family supported me and helped me achieve were I am today, but I do not come from a racing background.Dannyrsquos parents, Brenda and Denis, were delighted as their son received recognition for an outstanding season and hope that this is just the beginning for the promising young talent.ldquoWe are so proud of him, he has done all of this off his own back, said Brenda.ldquoHe has worked extremely hard to get to this point and I am so glad he is living his dream.ldquoEven though I canrsquot watch his big hurdle races until the final straight as I always have a motherrsquos worry, she added.Danny spent a brief time back with family in Downpatrick but is getting back to business as usual in England.ldquoI just plan on keeping my head down and hope to bring the momentum from this season into the next one, he said.ldquoEverything wouldnrsquot be possible without the help from all of the team at the stables and my familyrsquos support.

He had a rare gt for making everyone feel better about themselves and for knowing they always had a friend in him. Facebook notices of his death drew an unprecedented outpouring of tributes and comments from across the region and demonstrated the levels of affection in which Jim was held.As a footballer he had few peers. His time with Downpatrick Rec was marked with cup and league successes, culminating in lting the Steel and Sons Cup in front of record attendances at the Crusaders Seaview ground for the first drawn match and the subsequent replay.Supporters from Downpatrick travelled in their thousands, marking the event one of the most widely celebrated sporting achievements of that era. The gate receipts were the highest ever recorded for the annual showpiece of amateur soccer in Northern Ireland, so much so that for the first time the income exceeded the VAT threshold, which meant tax had to be paid.On the day the Rec won that Steel Cup replay, Distillery tried to sign Jim as he left the pitch. He turned them down with a typically firm but gentlemanly refusal and stayed with the Rec for another four years, helping them to add to their cabinet of silverware.Jim lsquoCootrsquo Connolly was a player of exceptional talent. A classy and cultured defender, he is remembered for his unique ability to rise above other players, most of whom had a distinct height advantage, but lacked Jimrsquos trademark for timing his runs and hanging in the air for longer than ought to have been humanly possible. Many a spectator were left speechless after matches, shaking their heads in puzzlement at his exploits. Yes, he was that good.Tony lsquoDartrsquo Curran, who was the Downpatrick Rec goalkeeper, said it was ldquosometimes scary playing behind Jim. ldquoWhen I walked with Coot or talked with him or more often had a beer with him, I felt I was in the presence of greatness.So much so that everyone wanted a part of that, and his we Angie and family had to learn to share Coot because he just made you feel good about yourself. For that we as a community are eternally grateful to them. His footballing ability was absolutely extraordinary. I played behind him and said to him on a few occasions lsquoCoot you scare me. The things you do defy the laws of physics and gravityrsquo. He would jump for a ball start to come down and without touching the ground go up again. I swear it.Tony added: ldquoThe world is a sadder place for his leaving but somewhere up there hersquoll be playing with the guys that have gone before him and maybe BFwill be managing. I hope they will keep me a place on their team.Former Rec manager Jim Prior was devastated to learn of Jimrsquos death. ldquoLike all his former teammates I am cut to ribbons that Jim is no longer with us. As a footballer, he was simply out of this world. The other players on our most successful team were in awe of Jim and all loved him. He had star quality written all over him.He could do things that others couldnrsquot do, whether that was on the training ground or in the toughest of matches. I canrsquot remember him putting in less than a five-star performance.The Recrsquos former club secretary, Patricia Murrayremembers Jim as the baby of the Steel Cup team. ldquoMy deepest and heartfelt sympathies to Angela and all his family and friends. His laugh, smile and craic will be truly missed, Patricia said.Jim Connollyrsquos impact with Downpatrick was repeated at his next clubs, Ards and Killyleagh YC, where he suffered a career ending injury. He had been with the club for just two seasons but left an indelible mark. One of Killyleaghrsquos stalwart players, Philip Jennings, posted his own tribute. ldquoGreat memories of watching Jim for the great Down Rec team and playing with him at Ards and Killyleagh. A real legend in local football, but even more than that, just an absolute gentleman.Despite his injury, Jim ed to football several years later to turn out for the Downshire Hospital, with whom he won an all-Ireland medal winner in  under the management of Brian Cheetham.But the question always remained about what could have become of this precocious talent had he been able to stick with one of English footballrsquos premier clubs.His trials there were cut short by homesickness, more particularly an abiding love for his recently widowed mother. Downpatrick was his anchor. Family, friends, and the Stream Street precinct of his youth were too deeply ingrained for the young Connolly to ever contemplate leaving them behind. It was never a regret for Jim. Indeed,anything, the choice to stay reinforced his passion and love for the area. He perhaps never knew how deeply those feelings of connection were ed by those who had the good fortune to know him.Jimrsquos trials were at Nottingham Forest, Newcastle, and Everton, all three organised by local scout Bill Oakes. Everton came closest to getting his signature after pursuing him back to Downpatrick, although it was later learned that Newcastle too badly wanted to bring him on board.Local sports writer Charlie McStay recalled being contacted in later years by one of the Newcastle coaches who was enquiring about what had happened to Jim. ldquoNewcastle knew they had a gem on their hands, but he slipped through the net.All the coaches rated him at the highest level and believed he would have gone on to become a true star of English football, said Charlie.What a journey that would have been. All the way from Dunleath City and Santos in the Downpatrick Youth League to the pinnacle of professional soccer.Although soccer was Jimrsquos first love, he was an accomplished boxer and in his early days was trained by Owen Kerr, a respected coach who was a friend of world heavyweight champion, Floyd Patterson. Coincidentally, Owen was uncle to Cathal Kerr, who married Jimrsquos sister Bronagh. Small world!Jim also played juvenile and senior football for the Downpatrick Russell Gaelic Union, which this week remembered him as ldquomore than just a great footballer.An online RGU statement said: ldquoHe was one of the nicest guys you could ever meet. A true gentleman with an infectious laugh, he will be sadly missed by all who knew him.Away from sport, Jim trained as a mechanic and later became a minibus driver at Knockevin School and the local hospitals. He then joined Ulsterbus as a driver at the Downpatrick depot and rounded off his career as a groundsman at the Delamont estate. Always active, alwaysbusy that was the Jim Connolly way.Throughout his le, Jimrsquos singular passion was his family and friends. He was devoted to his we Angela mdash the couple were together from their teenage days and were rarely seen apart mdash and to his children, Aurla, Blaine and Clare. Nothing brought him greater happiness also than the birth of his grandchildren, Ruby, Darcy, Fianna, Fiachra, Grace and Eve. He is also survived by brothers Pat and Martin, sisters Ann, Marie, Bronagh, and Eilish, by his father-in-law Paddy Teggart, and by sons-in-law Feargal and Jude and his daughter-in-law Megan.Theirs is not a private grief. It is shared by countless hundreds who remember the boy and man who gave so much pleasure and for whom there is always a place in their hearts.Joe McCoubrey.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5May2021-Job.jpg","title":"JobStart scheme to help young people welcomed by MLA  ","story":"THE launch of a new government scheme designed to create job opportunities for young people has been welcomed by local politicians.Department for Communities minister Deirdre Hargey last week launched the poundm JobStart scheme designed to support - year olds facing additional employment challenges due to the impact of Covid-.In addition, the government department has also helped create additional employment opportunities for young people and remove barriers for those seeking employment through the work experience programme and an expanded adviser discretionary fund.Minister Hargey said the Covid- pandemic has had an ldquounprecedented impact on the local economy and labour market and that as part of her departmentrsquos response, it has addressed the anticipated impacts on young people and those who are ready to be re-employed but need help negotiating the process of finding work.ldquoThis has included creating job opportunities and placements for young people providing additional payments towards travel or childcare expenses financial support of up to pound, a year to assist in the removal of barriers to employment and training to help people increase their chances of gaining employment.The JobStart scheme is designed to create opportunities for - year olds by providing positions with employers for a period of six months, increasing to nine months for those who meet additional criteria.An Opportunity Guarantee strand has been added to The Work Experience Programmefeaturing  week placements with the guarantee of an interview for a job or an apprenticeship on completion.Strangford MLA Kellie Armstrong and Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran have both welcomed the new scheme.Mrs Armstrong said the scheme was originally due to start last year, arguing that many young people may have missed out as a result of its delayed implementation.She continued: ldquoThe roll-out of this scheme is welcome as it will help young people climb back from the pandemic financially, while giving the economy a boost. I encourage them to apply for it.ldquoHowever, it is frustrating it has taken us so long to get to this stage. The rest of the UK benefited from it [the scheme] while Northern Ireland lagged behind which was unacceptable. Something which would be so useful can only lose value as time moves on.The MLA said that during the height of lockdown, people under  were the most impacted in terms of job losses and went from ldquoexpecting a scheme to wonderingone would appear at all, confirming that she has asked for confirmation that the Department for Communities will ensure opportunities from the JobStart scheme will be made available across Northern Ireland and will not just be concentrated around Belfast.Cllr Curran said with lockdown restrictions continuing to ease, any move to create job opportunities for young people is particularly welcome as they have a key role to play in future economic success.ldquoMany young people have bore the brunt of an unparalleled economic situation which has had a massive impact on the provincersquos economy, he continued.ldquoRebuilding the economy will require access to highly skilled and talented young iniduals to enable employers to compete globally and young people, in particular, need to be able to avail of high quality routes into careers.Cllr Curran also highlighted the importance of apprenticeship schemes to assist with economic recovery, and, looking forward, believes it is vital that the Newry, Mourne and Down area has access to highly skilled employers as businesses work to recover from the devastating impact of coronavirus.He said he firmly believes that the enterprise, innovation and entrepreneurship of young people is crucial to the economy..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5May2021-Athletics.jpg","title":"Lady luck for East Down AC runners  ","story":"THE  Belfast Half Marathon was always going to be a virtual affair due to Covid- restrictions, but that didnrsquot seem to put people off entering and setting their own route in order to chase a personal best for the distance or simply to claim their T-shirt.This event is normally well attended and attracts a raft of spectators, which creates a great atmosphere, but this year it was up to the runners to come up with a way of motivating themselves on the day.East Down AC had several runners who have used this as their incentive to keep churning out the long runs and as the date approached they were well prepared to cover the . miles.It was a case of girl power as all the EDAC athletes who took part were female on this occasion. Joanne Carson is credited with coming up with a pleasing route for her buddies, Helen Vint, Mags Flynn and Cathy Burke.These girls are to be seen most weekends, rain, hail or shine, chalking up miles in and around Downpatrick. Their dedication is most commendable. In their opinion, a half marathon is long enough to challenge the legs but not as draining as a full marathon so you could almost say that it is an enjoyable task.Joanne got them off to a familiar start. They met outside Castlewellan Forest Park on Saturday morning and ran into the park to do three laps of the lake. Nicely warmed up, they then headed out the main road to Newcastle and didnrsquot stop till they were in the grounds of the Slieve Donard hotel.They fairly breezed along and were all within sight of each other as they came to a halt. Cathy andMags were at the head of the pack in one hour  minutes with Helen less than a minute behind.Joanne was just a few seconds over the two hours and more than happy with her run and they all agreed that it was a scenic route.Being at the Percy French and the fact that outside hospitality had conveniently opened the night before, it would have been rude not to have an ice cold beverage to celebrate. Well deserved ladies.And so to Sunday, Suzy Smith often meets with friends and family including Kelly her niece for a long Sunday run.They stay close to home in Ballykinlar where the terrain could be described as lumpy. In fact whichever way they go, there are some challenging hills but these girls are well used to it and tough enough to persevere.Suzy had actually only planned to run a few miles with brother Patrick to encourage him on his way to the half marathon distance but she was enjoying it so much that she ran on and on until before she knew it, she had covered the entire . miles.Despite this only being her second time to complete a half marathon, she finished in a very respectable time of two hours and five minutes.Who knows how well she could doshe was participating in an official race Kelly meanwhile had struck a brisk pace from the off and followed her own rhythm easing ahead in the early stages. She has been running very well in training and it was no surprise that despite the gradients involved, she ended up with a personal best time of one hour  minutes.Again there is no doubt on a flatter course with other runners to chase, there will be improvement to come but for now both Smiths were content with their efforts and so they should be, well done..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/7May2021-Leader.jpg","title":"Leader and inspiration  ","story":"FINNEBROGUE Artisan has promised to continue the legacy of founding chairman Denis Lynn who died in a quad bike accident at the weekend.Hailed as an ldquoinnovator and visionary, Mr Lynn died following a tragic incident at his home in Killyleagh on Sunday.Mr Lynnbecame synonymous with his Downpatrick-based firm, which now employs , people over four local sites.On buying Finnebrogue Estate on the outskirts of the town in , the former potato chip seller turned to beef and deer farming and established Finnebrogue as the biggest venison processor and supplier in the UK.He then produced quality sausages, supplying Marks and Spencer and other leading retailers, and developed the nitrate-free bacon brand, Naked Bacon, in .More recently, Finnebrogue has ersied into developing meat-free products.The firmrsquos senior management team will now lead the business with non-executive director David Manning stepping up as interim-chairman and non-executive director Colin Walsh as interim deputy-chairman.A company statement paid tribute to Mr Lynn, who is survived by his we Christine, daughters Kerry, Clare, Tara and Ciara, and his wider family circle.It said: ldquoDenis was an innovator and a visionary with an infectious passion for delivering positive change for the planet and its people.

These exams were in speech and drama and acting.Clare said: ldquoFor the speech and drama grades the pupils have the opportunity to study poetry and stories. They learn to recite these with confidence, clear expression and articulation.ldquoThey learn how to discuss their work with the examiner and it is wonderful to watch their communication skills develop. It is amazing to see how each of these pupils have developed in confidence and the exams are a wonderful way to mark this achievement.ldquoAs pupils progress through the grades, they learn so much about how the voice works along with literary techniques which, in turn, helps them with literacy and English at school.She continued: ldquoSome senior pupils chose to do the acting pathway which involved them studying plays and monologues and understand how to develop characterisation, all the while enhancing their voice, movement, gesture and facial expression.ldquoThe acting exams are very like the audition process which some of the pupils have taken part in before for local casting agents.

Local agencies cannot be left alone to pick up the pieces and restore this fragile habitat.ldquoThe environment minister must urgently convene a cross-departmental taskforce that brings together the experience, focus and most importantly, resources, in order to meet the unprecedented challenges in rejuvenating this area.Mr Hazzard said the scenes of environmental destruction left in the Mournes as a result of the inferno show the urgent need to protect precious habitats, especially our peatlands.He added: ldquoIf managed correctly, peatlands play an important role in supporting rich ecosystems, improving water quality and also protecting our communities from the localised consequences of climate change.ldquoFor some time now a draft peatlands strategy has sat with the minister awaiting publication there can be no more delay. Minister Poots must publish this strategy as soon as possible.Meanwhile, the petition urging a ban on the sale of disposal barbecues in shops and supermarkets is gathering increasing support.The resident behind the petition said that every year a number of businesses push the the sale of cheap, disposable barbecues, which are frequently taken to be used in parks and green spaces, often without the landowners permission.ldquoIn many cases, having already scorched the ground below, these barbecues are frequently left, giving rise to wild fires. Disposable barbecues are bad for the environment in terms of use and disposal, said the resident.ldquoThese barbecues are made using unsustainable materials from tropical forests in South Africa and South America.ldquoThey canrsquot be recycled, burn grass and typically result in scattered litter. Just like Chinese sky lanterns which the local council previously took action on and which were also once acceptable, the time has come to ban disposable barbecues.The resident said disposable barbecues represent a ldquohuge fire risk, burn the ground underneath them, are often left as litter and contain sharp pieces that can harm animalstrodden on.She added: ldquoThey are used in beauty spots, wildle reserves and on beaches and are just left smouldering. They make it far too easy for people to be irresponsible by putting them directly on the ground and then leaving them there afterwards.ldquoLiving in an area of natural beauty we have many areas were people see fit to light a barbecue. The recent events have shown us we cannot take the risk. The earth is too fragile and the danger to humans and wildle is too great. These cheap, lightweight disposable barbecues, are not to be socially acceptable any longer..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/7May2021-Rosaleen.jpg","title":"Rosaleen praises family on her 100th birthday  ","story":"BORN the day before Northern Ireland came into being  years ago, Rosaleen Rogan celebrated her centenary in style on Sunday.The long and happy le of the devoted parishioner was celebrated at Holy Family Church in Teconnaught with a special Mass dedicated to her by the parish priest, Father Brendan Smyth.The mother-of-five, grandmother to  and great-grandmother to  was greeted by her family and friends staggered throughout the day after the service and at home.Said by her family to ldquostill buzzing on Monday, Mrs Rogan was overwhelmed by the amount of cards, flowers and Mass bouquets given to her to mark her momentous day.As May  in  was recently decreed as the day Northern Ireland was constituted, Mrs Rogan, who lives with her daughter, Mrs Stella Rea in Magheralone, is one of the last surviving Irish-born citizens in Northern Ireland.Her th birthday was recognised by both states with a card from the Queen and a letter from Irish President Michael D Higgins along with a cheque for pound,.Mrs Rogan was also very touched to have been sent a Papal blessing, which was a gt from the parish organised by Fr Smyth, and a letter of congratulations from the Lord Lieutenant of Down, Mr David Lindsay.She was also delighted to receive a visit from family friend and former South Down MP, Baroness Margaret Ritchie who helped the family mark the birthday.Mrs Rogan, who hails from Annacloy, was also joined on Sunday by her two surviving brothers, Joe and Maurice McGrath, with their wives and her sister Marie at the Mass.She is the widow of the late Joe Rogan, a well-known shoemaker and repairer in Drumaness, and often helped him with stitching jobs in the business over the years.The couple shared a devotion to their faith and celebrated  years of marriage on September .

That controlling impulse is in place in this current election for the DUP leadership. Candidates for the top position have been banned from doing interviews during the contest.This is not only an unreasonable bar, it is an unwise one for the DUP. It will make it easier for the party to select a replacement to Arlene Foster who has avoided saying something they later regret, or indeed that the whole DUP regrets. But it means the candidates cannot be grilled their thinking.This is problematic at any time, but above all now. For example, yesterday Mrs Foster attended a North South meeting, again raising doubt as to DUP policy on such meetings.And the latest troubling development on legacy, relating to the RUC , coming a day after the disturbing case around the killing of the IRA terrorist Joe McCann collapsed, means that we do need to know what the DUP believes about how to proceed legacy.Opacity will not help the party. It will merely, for example, lead people to assume that the DUP is going to take a positiononly later to be disappointedno such action is forthcoming.It would be better for the key positions of the two candidates to be made clear to both the DUP and the wider population before they are chosen.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

But scientists say it could be cleaner and safer than fission, the nuclear technology currently used to generate electricity.If Aberthaw is chosen, the council is hoping the power plant could bring lots of high-tech high-paid jobs to the region. Westminster should decide on a site by the end of next year, and the power plant would be built by , costing about pound billion.But the Valersquos cabinet used controversial emergency powers last month to put forward Aberthaw as a site, without consulting the full council or any scrutiny committees. Council leader Neil Moore said this was due to the deadline for suggestions at the end of last month.     However, Westminster made the initial call for suggestions in December last year, meaning the council had four months in total to debate and scrutinise the decision to put forward Aberthaw. The council debated the issue in a meeting this week, after the deadline passed.Conservative Cllr Gordon Kemp said: ldquoThis is being dealt effectively without allowing any proper consideration or scrutiny. Itrsquos an extremely signicant matter, evenwe ignore the issue of public concern over such a proposal.ldquoWersquore looking at potentially a colossal, massive investment in the Vale. It could create many jobs, so I think itrsquos something that should have been discussed.ldquoI appreciate there are always deadlines on this. But Irsquom very concerned and surprised this wasnrsquot put before cabinet and scrutiny committees [earlier].Cllr Moore said the issue was ldquonot a debate, but promised to meet with the leaders of the opposition parties on the council, and to give a cross-party scrutiny committee a chance to consider the plans.He said: ldquoThis is just for noting. We used the emergency procedure because it had to be in by a deadline. This is not a debate about what we can do.ldquoBut Irsquom more than happy to have a meeting with the group leaders, and Irsquom more than happy to ask for an information report to go to the environment and regeneration scrutiny committee. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

During my  years as a community campaigner I have passionately campaigned for education, creating more opportunities for young people, tackling the housing crisis and the climate crisis. I was the regeneration officer for the Loudoun Square and Trowbridge redevelopment, and was selected as the Wales delegate for the International Association for Community Development and Commonwealth Games in Glasgow . Over the last  years Irsquove supported young people in Cardf South and Penarth to develop their skills in the arts and creative industries and to participate in a wide range of opportunities. I successfully gained the London  Olympic Cultural Inspire Mark for Butetown Community. I entered politics because of the increasing injustice around me - increasing food banks, homelessness, education, climate crisis, lack of opportunity for our youth, lack of affordable housing I was sick and tired of our communities being treated like second class citizens by the London elite. I want a fair deal for our communities for Cardf South and Penarth and for Wales.Alan Golding - Freedom Alliance. No Lockdown. No CurfewsRaised in Tonyrefail, Rhondda Cynon Taff, I have since lived in Brighton and Glasgow, moving to Cardf in . Since my early twenties Irsquove been interested in the workings of society and how we treat each other, animals and our planethellip and in the process Irsquove come to completely mistrust virtually all career politicians. I believe a new way of doing politics is needed in Wales with a new set of values across the whole system. I donrsquot believe the current political structure and its controllers have the interest of the people at its heart with regard to their mental and physical health, their quality of le and spiritual and economic well-being.     Paul Campbell - UKIPHello Im Paul Campbell and Im standing in the Cardf South and South Wales Central area for UKIP in the Senedd elections on MAY TH.Being. Born in Cardf and lived most of my le there I appreciate the Greatv Potential the pride and the Welsh Identity in Cardf and the Valleys towns. and I have seen how things have changed over the years with parts of the area unrecognizable from the place I remember.Areas of Cardf have become run down and standards have fallen with a loss of community spirit The surrounding Towns have been neglected with. A lack of investment and job creation initiatives.Mass immigration in the UK has put tremendous strains on cities like Cardf Newport and Swansea with wage depression and overstretched public services.. The Conservatives claim to be in control of immigration but they will only ever talk about it and under there watch in the in the last  years  million more people have come to our shires thats  cities the sthe size of Cardf . Increasingly they are choosing to come to Wales as Labour has encouraged them by a making Wales a Nation Of sanctuary.Helen Westhead - Green PartyOur current administration has ignored the climate emergency and has left so many people vulnerable and excluded. As we recover from the pandemic we have unique opportunity to create better ways of working - the influence of an elected Green in the room will be transformative.We see from across the UK, Europe, and beyond the incredible dference Greens make, holding government to account, speaking out against inequality, and representing real people and their communities, not political or corporate interest. Wales is long overdue that representation in the Senedd.We know that the way we recover from this pandemic and build back stronger is through investing in communities and public services, ensuring everyone has access to local facilities, and supporting small business. If elected, one of my main priorities would be better walking and cycling routes, connected to affordable public transport and green outdoor spaces that communities can enjoy. Advocating for a Universal Basic Income would ensure no one is left behind in our bold plan to transform Wales.With the more proportional voting system on the regional ballot in Wales, Labour cannot win regional seats. A Green vote on your second ballot is the only progressive option.Matt Friend - PropelPropel has led the campaigns on two of the most important issues affecting Barry, Penarth and Cardf.Wersquore the only party that has committed not to allow any nuclear mud to be dumped in our waters, including the mud dredged from outside Hinkley nuclear reactor in Somerset.And wersquore the only party that even mentions the scandal of dangerous fire risk cladding on so many of our flats and buildings. Through our Contract with Wales we have committed not to issue new building contracts to any housing developer involved in the scandal, until they have paid to fix the problem they created.Wersquoll also end the way leaseholders are getting rinsed by introducing a service charge cap, linked to the Retail Price Index. That will stop the double digit increases in service charges that leaseholders have had to put up with.Most importantly, wersquoll introduce a Coronavirus Recovery Act to end Welsh lockdowns, save lives and restore freedoms. We canrsquot just hope wersquoll get our freedoms back, we have to vote for them.The ten laws in our Contract with Wales will transform our nation. Wales needs champions. Vote Propel.Alex Wilson, Liberal DemocratsI live with my family in Penarth and I became involved in politics because of the widening isions that seemed to occurring our community. I feel that with the Liberal Democrat core values of tolerance and understanding we can bring people back together. We can cut through the shouting of partisan politics and once again listen to what people want in their community.The next five years is going to be critical and I feel the Senedd must put recovery first. That means recovering from the Covid pandemic, the recovery of our economy, better healthcare services and a happier community which can be achieved by better transport links, saving our environment and ato community values.Irsquove been around long enough to know a political status-quo without a strong opposition can breed complacency. Wersquove seen this in national and local government. If I am elected I will ensure that the voice of the people is heard. If yoursquove ever wondered how we almost lost the Kymin or how they plan to build over  homes on contaminated land at Cosmeston Farm in Sully, well itrsquos because our current political leaders often lack empathy with local communities.Other candidates standing are:Vaughan Gething - LabourAngus Hawkins - Gwlad The Welsh Independence PartyLisa Peregrine ndash Abolish the Welsh Assembly Party Alan Pick ndash Reform UKDavid Rolfe ndash IndependentLeighton Rowlands ndash Conservative article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Otherwise a coalition must be attempted.:Who can vote Anyone over the age of  can vote in the Senedd election provided they are:- registered to do so- living in Wales- not legally excluded from votingThis is the first time  and -year-olds have been eligible to vote. What impact that has on the result remains to be seen.How do I vote There are three ways - in person, by post and by proxy - however, the deadlines for latter two options have already passed.Voting at the polling booth with take place until pm today.Polling stations will be kitted out with hand sanitiser and distancing markers to help voters remain safe from coronavirus.Most crucially, voters are being asked to bring their own pen or pencil.Face coverings must also be worn, unless exempt.How does the voting system work Each voter will have two votes - one constituency vote and one regional vote.Youll be represented in the Senedd by five Members. One for your constituency and four for the region of Wales where you live.Constituency vote - this is for the person you want to represent you and your local area. Wales has  constituencies, with each being represented by one MS in the Senedd. Constituency votes are counted in a first past the post system - so the candidate with the most votes is elected.     Regional vote - This is for who you want to represent your region of Wales - South Wales East, South Wales Central, South Wales West Mid and West Wales and North Wales. There are  regional Senedd Members, elected by the additional member system.When will results be announced As with a lot of things this past year, the election has been hit by Covid restrictions.While voting will happen today, counting will not take place the same night as is usually the case on election night.Instead, the votes will be taken to the counting locations and kept secure until morning.They will then be veried - spoiled ballots removed - and counted.Due to Covid restrictions, this will likely take longer than in normal counts, but results are expected within two days of polls closing.Keep an eye on the Argus website for the latest, and results. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThe findings could have potential implications for improving the design of man-made machines such as underwater drones and submersibles.Using cutting-edge engineering and animal behaviour, scientists have explained the origins of efficient swimming in the animals.Seals and sea lions are fast-swimming ocean predators that use their flippers to ldquofly through the water.But not all seals are the same ndash some use their front flippers to swim, while others propel themselves with their back feet.Fur seals and sea lions have wing-like front flippers specialised for swimming, while grey and harbour seals have stubby, clawed paws and swim with their feet.The reason behind these two dferent methods has long been a mystery to biologists, but now a new study led by Australiarsquos Monash University and including scientists from Londonrsquos Natural History Museumhas attempted to understand the evolution of these distinctive styles.Using computer simulations alongside footage of live seals, the team hoped to finally answer this mystery.Dr Travis Park, a researcher from the Natural History Museum who was involved in the study, said: ldquoOne of the key specimens used in this study was a female grey seal that was brought to the Natural History Museum after its remains were found in Margate.ldquoAlong with help from the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital, who CT-scanned the animal for us, our scientists were able to turn this sad loss into a new understanding of how swimming in seals has evolved.The adult grey seal was found dead in Walpole Bay in Margate in  and was taken to the NHM for study.As well as analysing the animalrsquos limbs for the study, the team looked for parasites and investigated its stomach for a study into marine le ingestion of plastics.During the dissection, the team found a metal object in the sealrsquos head which they believed to be the cause of death. They reported the finding to the RSPCA.     As well as real specimens, researchers used simulations to help understand how dferent seals propel themselves through the water.Lead author David Hocking, of Monash University, teamed up with engineer Dr Shibo Wang, from the universityrsquos department of mechanical and aerospace engineering, to use simulations to show how water flows around seal flippers of dferent shapes.Dr Hocking said: ldquoOur analysis showed that some Antarctic seals, like leopard seals, actually have very streamlined, wing-like forelimbs, despite being from the lsquofoot-propelledrsquo seal family.The discovery shows how wing-like flippers can evolve in seals that already swim with their back feet, providing a pathway for the evolution of forelimb swimming in the fur seals and sea lions.Dr Park added: ldquoWe found that grey seals still use their paws to hold their prey when processing it, but other seals like leopard seals have forgone this ability to maximise their swimming speed and agility, being able to capture more mobile prey.Researchers said that as well as explaining the origin of seals, this study may also improve human design.Dr Hocking said: ldquoSeals have had millions of years to perfect their swimming, and they can teach us a thing or two about underwater grace and elegance.ldquoLearning from them may help us to improve the design of human-built machines like underwater drones and submersibles, increasing their speed, manoeuvrability or energy efficiency.rsquondash The study is published in Current Biology.Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Had these been paid for, as they would have been in the   financial year, this could have generated £, for Council.Speaking at March’s meeting of Council’s environmental services committee, Council’s head of environmental services, Barry Patience, accepted  was not a “normal year” for data on the use of the service to be collected.Although he did note that prior to the introduction of free bulky waste collections, the service had been generating £-, in revenue for Council.SDLP Councillor Ciaran Toman made a proposal at that meeting for officers to bring a report back to the committee on the possibility of an extension of the fee free bulky waste collection service.The proposal was seconded by his party colleague, Councillor Thomas Larkham.Speaking to the Local Democracy Reporting Service this week, Cllr Toman welcomed the working group’s ability to speak with one voice on this matter.“It has been a tough year for everyone,” said Cllr Toman. “While Council carried out , bulky waste collections over the past year, the recorded fly-tipping incidents jumped from  in   to  in  .“This suggests some form of direct correlation between the closing of our recycling centres and the postponed bulky waste collections which were affected by the pandemic.“I very much see bulky waste collections as an essential service in Council’s efforts to tackle fly-tipping and keeping our streets and countryside clean.“I am pleased there was unanimous agreement to maintain the system as it is, fee-free and review it again in a further  months.”Editor’s message:Thank you for reading this article.
