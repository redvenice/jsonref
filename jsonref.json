A little boy called Willem Fogle. He was my little son. Stillborn at 8 months. A little boy I never got to know. A little life that never got to live. A breath that was never exhaled.          Ben Fogle has conquered Mount Everest, days after revealing he had taken on the ascent in memory of his stillborn son Willem. News of the successful climb was revealed on the Instagram page of former cyclist Victoria Pendleton, who was forced to abandon her own ascent earlier this month on medical grounds. She also posted a picture of Fogle (left) and his team          Fogle\u0027s climbing partner Victoria Pendleton (right) was forced to abandon the trek earlier this month on medical grounds\u0027His loss changed our lives and I think about him daily. Losing my little boy made me re-evaluate life. Not only do we hold our two beautiful children closer to us but it was a reminder to live life for the now. Don\u0027t waste it.\u0027 The trip was not without problems. He had to scale the final 2,700ft, known as the \u0027death zone\u0027, alone after his climbing partner, Pendleton, was forced to abandon the challenge.TV star Ben Fogle and ex-Olympian Victoria Pendleton start...TV adventurer Ben Fogle and former Olympic cyclist Victoria...Share this articleThe Olympic cyclist began suffering from the effects of hypoxia - oxygen deficiency - at Camp 2, 6,400 metres above sea level, and required additional oxygen to alleviate her symptoms.The double gold Olympic cyclist cheered on the team lead by experienced mountaineer, Kentoon Cool, from the side lines and posted her congratulations online when they finished: \u0027Congratulations to @benfogle@kentoncool Mark @fishercreative and the team for reaching the summit of Mount Everest thanks to @anythingispossible.world in support of @britishredcross #believe #everest2018\u0027.

Never. There is a spirituality but I can also feel the support and the love here on Instagram.

I will never take life for granted but above all I\u0027ll never be alone.\u0027          Pendleton, from Stotfold in Bedfordshire, admitted in December that she was taking part in the challenge because she was \u0027probably having a midlife crisis\u0027 Ben Fogle on Instagram: “A thank you to YOU ALL from the summit of the world @britishredcross @anythingispossible.world @unenvironment”"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/18/15/4C66723F00000578-5737593-image-a-3_1526653875447.jpg","title":"Meghan Markles ancestor one black baseballs greatests","story":"    William Demont \u0027Happy\u0027 Evans Jr - Meghan Markle\u0027s great-great uncle by marriage to Lillie Evans - played for the Homestead Grays in \u0027negro leagues\u0027 when US baseball was segregatedMeghan Markle\u0027s pioneering great-great uncle was a professional baseball player who never got to play in the major league because he was black, DailyMail.com can reveal.William Demont \u0027Happy\u0027 Evans Jr - Meghan\u0027s great-great uncle - played for the prestigious  Homestead Grays in the American Negro League, the Negro National League, and independent leagues for black players when US baseball was segregated.Known for having one of the strongest throwing arms in baseball, Evans helped the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania-based Grays win eastern championships in 1930 and 1931 - the equivalent, say historians of winning the Negro World Series, as none took place in those years.Evans\u0027 other nickname was \u0027The Gray Ghost\u0027, because of his foot-speed and good play as an outfielder.Evans, a Kentucky native, played in the segregated Negro Leagues between 1920 and 1937, a decade before Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier for African-American players in Major League Baseball.He played alongside some of the most famous players in the Negro Leagues, including Hall of Famers Josh Gibson and Oscar Charleston with the Grays.Jacob Pomrenke of the Society for American Baseball Research (SABR), based at Arizona State University, who helped DailyMail.com uncover the asotnishing story, said: \u0027Evans was known to have one of the strongest throwing arms in baseball and he was an important contributor to one of the greatest Negro Leagues teams ever built, the 1931 Homestead Grays.\u0027Asked if he knew why Evans had the nickname \u0027Happy\u0027, Pomrenke said: \u0027It was likely because he had a pleasant disposition - similar to other ballplayers named Happy in that era - but it could have been for other reasons, so I can\u0027t say for sure.\u0027Meghan\u0027s great-great uncle died she she was five but she knew his wife, Lillie Evans, who died when she was 22.Her great-great aunt was a pioneering figure in her own right, working as a maid and a cook when she was forced by financial hardship to drop out of college in Tennessee, but then forging a successful career in Los Angeles as a realtor which saw her endow her local community with a swimming pool.Evans left her Los Angeles home to Doria Ragland, Meghan\u0027s mom, and she continues to live there.   Known for having one of the strongest throwing arms in baseball, Evans helped the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania-based Grays win eastern championships in 1930 and 1931, years when there was no Negro World Series taking place. Evans is circled, standing fourth from the left with his teammates in 1931, including Hall of Famers Josh Gibson (standing fourth from right) and Oscar Charleston (standing second from right)          Author and historian Phil Dixon writes about Evans\u0027 talent in his book, American Baseball Chronicles: The Great Teams, the 1931 Grays. Dixon says that Evans, a Kentucky native, scored over 70 runsIt may be Markle\u0027s link to athletic success which is most surprising, however - and one which highlights the struggle of her African-American ancestors against racism and segregation.Evans was part of a team which at the time was hailed for its dominance. In a 1936 Pittsburgh Courier article the write said he \u0027considers the 1931 Homestead Grays the strongest club the Grays ever assembled and the strongest club of modern Negro baseball as far back as we can remember\u0027.It also said: \u0027Much of the credit due this club of 1931 can be given to Bill Evans and George Britt. Evans filled in at short-stop for three months and took part in all the important series.\u0027Online bloggers have also debated whether the 1931 Grays were the top Negro League team of all time.Their existence as a team came as part of the Great Migration, the movement of African-Americans from the poor south to the booming industrial north - among them Homestead, a steel town just outside Pittsburgh. In 1910 black mill workers created the Homestead Grays as a recreational activity, according to website Baseball Almanac the team \u0027would eventually thrill baseball fans for years\u0027.The Almanac writes that under the leadership of owner Cumberland Posey the team were \u0027known as barnstormers who would play ball in hundreds of small towns, usually taking on and beating the best local baseball talent available, white or black\u0027. Historian Phil Dixon, the author of American Baseball Chronicles: The Great Teams, the 1931 Grays - was able to give a detailed account of Evans\u0027 achievements at the Grays - a team he described \u0027the greatest all around baseball team ever assembled\u0027.He said: \u0027In 1931 Evans scored over seventy runs and surpassed 125 hits while banging 18 doubles, 5 triples and a pair of home runs - numbers he collected while serving in the dual capacity as an outfielderinfielder.\u0027He could be considered a utility player, both of those positions required you to throw very well. The thing is Evans had to be a great ball player to even get on that team. There was not a weak link on that team.\u0027Speaking about the team\u0027s incredible record, the writer said: \u0027From a winning stand point they won more games, lost fewer games than anyone.          Satchel Paige is the only 1931 Grays player who made it into the Major League. The pitcher, who threw a few games for the Grays in 1931, entered the MLB in 1948, aged 42, a year after Jackie Robinson ended segregation. He first played for the Cleveland Indians\u0027They scored over 1600 runs, they had four pitchers who won 20 games, they had five guys that hit over 20 home runs. It goes on and on, everything this team did was big.\u0027That Homestead Grays team was in my estimation the greatest all around baseball team ever assembled period, that includes Major League and everything. That team, their record was they won 143 games and they lost 29.\u0027The New York Yankees didn\u0027t score 1,000 runs until 1938 but this team scored 1600 runs. They were outstanding. They had a tremendous team.\u0027I think if I\u0027m correct the team has about six Hall of Famers that are in the Hall of Fame in Cooperstown today from that team, with Babe Ruth and all the rest of them.\u0027Despite the team\u0027s talents, however, the players never got to compete in the major leagues because of the color of their skin.Dixon said: \u0027They had everything going for them, but the only thing they couldn\u0027t get past was racism. At that time, they couldn\u0027t even get into the major leagues because of segregation.\u0027Segregation, not only did it affect where they played, but it also affected their livelihood, how much they were paid, endorsements, they didn\u0027t get any endorsements, and basically when you finished playing ball you had to get whatever job you could get.\u0027Many of these guys who were just tremendous ball players never got paid, so they went into other things, and some of them were pretty good at these other things they went into. But they never got the money.\u0027People call baseball the national pastime and I tell people that America\u0027s other national pastime was racism.\u0027Comparing what the Negro league players earned to 1930s major league star Dizzy Dean, Dixon explained: \u0027Take Dizzy Dean a great player in the Hall of Fame, Dean was making $7,500 and he made three times that much in endorsements so he might have been around $40-50,000 a year and these guys playing in the negro leagues they were lucky if they were getting $400 a month.\u0027It was a huge disparity, and you weren\u0027t going to get any endorsements for anything, Dizzy Dean was advertising clothing, hats, toys, greeting cards, he was being paid for going on the radio, they got all of that and these black guys got none of it.\u0027Bill Evans played for several Negro baseball teams in different Negro baseball leagues.He began playing amateur and collegiate baseball with the Louisville White Sox and Livingston College from 1916-1919.His professional career began in the Negro National League in 1920 with the Chicago based traveling team Gilkerson Union Giants, a founding member of that league. He played for them through until 1924 but his record for them is hard to track as the Giants didn\u0027t have a home stadium. From 1924-25 he played for their local rival the Chicago American Giants who were led by famous black pitcher Rube Foster. He then moved to the Indianapolis ABCs the following year (1926) and also played for a team called Dayton Marcos that year. In 1927 he moved to the Cleveland Hornets and in 1928 and possibly 1929 he moved again, this time to the Brooklyn Royal Giants.Then came the most successful stint of his career at the Homestead Grays from 1930-34, although for part of 1932 he also played for the Washington Pilots. It was in Los Angeles that Lillie became a pioneering realtor with a passion to help those less fortunate. DailyMail.com has learned that Lille built a public swimming pool behind her Los Angeles office to help underprivileged local children. The late Mrs Evans was interviewed by the Los Angeles Times newspaper back in December 1971 about the project          This is the location of the real estate office Evans held 50 years ago.

It\u0027s the first photo to emerge of her.The pool was situated at 7315 S Normandie Av, in South Los Angeles and DailyMail.com visited the site this week.Now in a state of disrepair, it is in part of the city that remains mainly populated by black and Hiic people. No one at the address or next door remembered the pool – which was built exactly 50 years ago in 1968. Lillie had converted a small parking lot into the pool and the filled-in site is now the back yard of a dilapidated row of homes.The pool was used by \u0027400 to 500 youngsters each summer\u0027 with no charge and was used by neighborhood youth groups and \u0027any kid who has supervision\u0027, Lillie said: \u0027It\u0027s about the only service I can give to the community.\u0027Meghan\u0027s relative owned and maintained the pool while a teacher from nearby Compton Community College named Harold Price offered swimming lessons to the children.Lillie was born in Tennessee, the daughter of tailor Jeremiah Ragland and seamstress Claudie Ritchie.

The pair met in the city not long after Meghan arrived to film SuitsShe is also credited by many as the brains behind Meghan’s transformation from television actress to polished princess in waiting. It is largely thanks to their flourishing friendship that American-born Meghan, who relocated to Canada while filming the television series Suits, found herself moving through the kind of high-powered social circles that ultimately led her to Harry’s side.Meghan and Jessica are now so close that it is sometimes hard to tell them apart. Dark-haired elegant — and extremely well-married — Jessica could indeed pass as Meghan Mark II.Not for nothing is Mulroney known as the ‘Gwyneth Paltrow of Toronto’. Born into Canada’s wealthy Browns shoes dynasty, a family empire worth a reported £50 million, the privately educated heiress is married to Ben Mulroney, son of the former Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney — and firm friends with the wife of the current one.      She apparently enjoys the kind of glamorous lifestyle that could have come straight out of the pages of a glossy magazine, and is regarded as the closest thing to royalty in that country.Every facet of her enviable life is shared on the social media sharing site Instagram — from her three beautiful children, to her impressive exercise routine and elegant social life. And, of course, her friendship with Meghan.Certainly, it is hard to see how Harry’s fiancee would have made it into the Canadian A-list without this female powerhouse.They met in 2011, not long after Meghan arrived in Toronto where Suits was filmed.The Mail understands that Meghan initially employed Mulroney as a fashion stylist after she shot to fame as ambitious paralegal Rachel Zane. The pair bonded over their love of yoga, dogs, expensive red wine, healthy eating, work-outs and charity work. What began as a professional relationship swiftly turned to a deep and lasting friendship.And before long, Meghan had adopted Mulroney’s sophisticated socialite style.It was under her guidance that, after meeting Prince Harry, Meghan swiftly ditched the racier ensembles she once delighted in wearing and embraced a sophisticated, pared-down chic.Out went the leather skirts and plunging necklines. In came elegant, to-the-knee shift dresses and crisp white shirts.Before too long, it was noted, the two women were wearing their long dark tresses in the same style and were often photographed sporting very similar outfits.When Meghan moved to the UK in the run-up to her engagement to Harry, it was Mulroney who helped her put together a wardrobe of clothes fit for royalty.          Mulroney is an Instagram addict, which she uses to chronicle every facet of her enviable lifeShe was also behind the white wrap coat, green shift dress and nude heels that Meghan wore when she and Prince Harry announced their engagement in the gardens of Kensington Palace last autumn.It goes without saying, too, that the dress Meghan wears on Saturday has had the Mulroney seal of approval at every stage of its creation.She is thought to have flown to the UK from Canada at least three times in recent months to oversee key fittings. But, while Jessica is believed to have advised Meghan on everything from the dress to the flowers to the wedding lunch, her family’s invitation to Saturday’s Royal Wedding is about so much more than professional gratitude.The fact that her children, seven-year-old twins Brian and John and five-year-old daughter Ivy, will be among the ten page boys and flower girls who will follow Meghan as she walks up the aisle at St George’s Chapel in Windsor at the weekend is testament to just how close the women have become.At a time when members of her own family, especially her embarrassingly loquacious half-sister Samantha Markle, have let Meghan down over and again, it is Mulroney who has stuck faithfully by her side.Donald and Melania Trump will honor Harry and Meghan with a...Feuding palace courtiers are whispering about the Markle...Share this articleMeghan — ‘Aunty Meg’ to her friend’s three children — has described the Mulroney’s house in Toronto as her ‘home away from home’. It was here that the earliest whispers about her burgeoning romance with Harry were shared.Here too, that the Prince and Meghan were able to spend time together away from the glare of publicity that would have undoubtedly blazed down upon them in the UK.But the two women could not have come from more different backgrounds. Meghan’s humble roots lie in Los Angeles where her father Thomas, a former lighting director, was declared bankrupt in 2016.Her mother Doria, who used to work for an airline, is now a yoga teacher and social worker. Her mother’s great-great-grandfather was a freed slave named Wisdom.Jessica, meanwhile, was privately educated at an exclusive girls’ school before going to McGill University where she studied industrial relations and economics.          Meghan Markle and Jessica Mulroney on holiday in Italy in 2016. Meghan captioned the images she posted ‘La dolce vita’ and the trip even had its own special hashtag on Instagram, ‘MJxItaly’, so fans could follow every moment of their glamorous getawayIn 2007, she married television presenter Benedict Mulroney, whose father Brian was Canada’s Prime Minister from 1984 to 1993.Much of Jessica and Meghan’s friendship has been played out on social media.The early days of their friendship were recorded with plentiful snaps of a holiday in Italy they shared in the summer of 2016.It was clear to anyone who saw the Instagram photographs of the women sunbathing in their bikinis on the deck of a boat, or sipping Negroni cocktails by the pool, that they were inseparable.Meghan captioned the images she posted ‘La dolce vita’ and the trip even had its own special hashtag on Instagram, ‘MJxItaly’, so fans could follow every moment of their glamorous getaway.But, crucially, it was also largely thanks to this friendship that Meghan began to rub shoulders with Canadian society’s big movers and shakers, among them 42-year-old Sophie Gregoire Trudeau, a flamboyant former TV presenter, who is now better known as the wife of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.Other friends of Mulroney’s who helped pave the road to Harry’s door include Markus Anderson, the suave party-loving business brains behind the opening of the Toronto branch of the ultra-fashionable private members club Soho House — of which Harry is also a member.If ever a sign was needed that Meghan had ‘made it’ in Canadian high society, it was surely the sight of her at the club’s pretty rooftop bar with Sophie Trudeau and Mulroney on a girls’ night out together in 2016.She and Harry are said to have been set up on a blind date by a mutual friend — whose identity they won’t reveal.Before news of the royal romance broke, Jessica and husband Ben, 41, had Meghan and Harry over for several cosy, discreet dinners where they could spend precious time together away from prying eyes. At the closing ceremony of Prince Harry’s Invictus Games last October, where he was seen kissing Meghan in public for the first time, Jessica was one of just two friends selected to join the actress in her private box.          It is largely thanks to this friendship that Meghan began to rub shoulders with Canadian society’s big movers and shakers, putting her on the road to meeting Prince Harry Once Meghan had been catapulted into the social stratosphere, Mulroney happily slipped into the role of Girl Friday, quietly advising and supporting her — but always remaining tight-lipped.The two women enjoyed a foretaste of royal bridal dress planning when Meghan turned to Mulroney for help choosing a wedding gown for her Suits character Rachel Zane — who was stood up at the altar by her on-screen fiance, Mike Ross.On that occasion, Meghan chose an Anne Barge Versailles dress from the Canadian bridal boutique which Mulroney represents as a PR.Mulroney posted a photograph of her friend wearing the dress with the the social media hashtag ‘princess goals’.Meghan, meanwhile, apparently returned the favour by name-dropping her friend during an interview about her on-screen wedding.‘I went through all the options with my dear friend Jessica Mulroney of Kleinfeld Hudson’s Bay in Canada,’ Meghan said.‘I put this one on and it just screamed “Rachel”. It is classic and fairytale and the culmination of everything she’s been waiting for.’As a bridal expert, of course, Mulroney’s closeness to Meghan and the royals will do her no professional harm.Jessica has, since 2013, done PR for the aforementioned Kleinfeld Bridal, an upmarket Toronto boutique, which as well as selling dreamy designer dresses worth thousands of pounds, also offers £200 lacy lingerie and £300 crystal-embellished headbands.In February this year, she set up an Instagram account devoted to ‘all things bridal and style’, on which she showcases her ideas for wedding day fashion, food and exotic honeymoons. She also posts photographs of grateful brides she’s rehearsed and styled for their big day.          Jessica Mulroney and her children. Meghan is ‘Aunty Meg’ to the children and has described the Mulroney’s house in Toronto as her ‘home away from home’She’s also guest editor of Wedding Vacations magazine and makes regular appearances as a bridal expert on Canadian daytime TV.Given the attention Meghan’s clothing choices already get, a friend like Mulroney is valuable indeed. She rode to Meghan’s rescue when she was agonising over what to wear to Pippa Middleton’s wedding a year ago.Palace insiders say she wore a simple black dress for the evening do, which Jessica — demonstrating a keen awareness of royal protocol — recommended only after finding out the details of Kate’s outfit, thereby avoiding a clash with her future sister-in-law.‘Jessica is smart enough to know that, as well as making sure Meghan looks her best, they also need to be mindful about what Kate is wearing,’ a source said at the time.Yesterday afternoon, Jessica was spotted hand in hand with her five-year-old daughter Ivy, doing some last-minute shopping in Marks \u0026amp Spencer close to Kensington Palace where the family are thought to be staying.So how will you spot her among the congregation on Saturday? Easy. Look out for a woman with Meghan’s shiny dark hair, dewy skin and impeccable dress sense. That’ll be her."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/17/11/4C58CACC00000578-5739861-image-a-13_1526552773853.jpg","title":"Meghan Markles trusted circle Pictures women friends fly UK big day","story":"    While her family tears itself apart in the days before her wedding, Meghan Markle can at least rely on her trusted girl squad who have flown to the UK for her big day.

I’d done a student film for her when we were in university together, so she gave him the film the next day.‘He called me and said, “You’re going to make money, and I want to take 10 per cent”. He was like, “I think you need to stay in LA.”‘Then you fast forward all these years of not working and trying to figure it out, and I’m just so grateful that all the stars came into alignment for Suits, because it’s changed my life.’It was after arriving in Toronto, and landing her role in Suits, that Meghan became close to co-star Sarah Rafferty, who plays Donna Paulsen in the show.

I aspire to be as philanthropic as she is, and to have as much of an impact as her.’Meghan’s close friendship with Indian actress and UNICEF ambassador Priyanka Chopra can also be spotted on her Instagram page.After meeting her at a party in Toronto, Meghan interviewed her for her blog, the Tig, and Priyanka has posted photos of them drinking cocktails together.In an interview with Vanity Fair Priyanka said of her friend: ‘It would have been nice to write about her, not just her boyfriend.‘I mean, she\u0027s an actor, she\u0027s an activist, she\u0027s a philanthropist. It\u0027s just a little sexist ...‘There needs to be a certain sense of equality where a woman is not just a plus-one, you know.

Percy Pilcher invented the first powered airplane in 1899 but died after takeoff While women appear to have been particularly \u0027hidden from history\u0027, scientists, explorers, and even an English King have also been overlooked. People are being asked to vote on their favourite forgotten figure as part of a campaign to get a picture of one of them on a bank note. Dr Tom Dowling said: \u0027History, it has often been suggested, is invariably written by the victors, and, for most of British history, those \u0027victors\u0027 have tended to be a certain kind of middle-aged white man.\u0027As a result, the margins of British history are stacked with figures that, arguably, warrant a more central place in our collective national story. \u0027This list considers some of the most deserving candidates for the title of The Most Overlooked Person in British History.\u0027Christian Mendes, Head of Privilege Home Insurance said: \u0027British people are remembered all over the world for myriad of fascinating reasons. \u0027However, as a British brand, we couldn\u0027t help but think that there must be lots of people who have made an important contribution to our daily lives, but that history has forgotten. \u0027We wanted to do them justice - so this list is a list of people you may have never heard of but really ought to have!\u0027 \u0027This is because of you\u0027: Haunting last message of acid...EXCLUSIVE: \u0027I can\u0027t believe it too, but I’m serious.\u0027 The...Share this articleJames Clerk Maxwell paved the way for colour photography and wireless radio through his pioneering study of geometrical optics, demonstrated the fluidity of Saturn\u0027s rings, and made the creation of wireless radio possible through his theory that electromagnetic waves existedAccording to the late Stephen Hawking, the 19th century Scottish physicist has remained \u0027the unsung hero of British science.\u0027Maxwell\u0027s relatively early death in 1879, at the age of 48, ensured that he did not live to see most of the remarkable scientific developments and innovations his theories gave rise to.In addition, the complexity of Maxwell\u0027s broader theories meant that their wider implications and potential application were not always easily translatable to the general public.Shaped Britain\u0027s welfare state: Sir Alfred Watson, Actuary and Civil Servant (1870 - 1936)  As a government actuary, between 1917 and 1936, Watson played a key role in numerous crucial committees on social policy, including that of national health insurance in 1924-26 and the 1925 inquiry into a national pension scheme, paving the way for the systematic welfare reforms of the late 1940s.Whilst the beginnings of Britain\u0027s post-war welfare reforms are now more commonly associated with more high-profile politicians and campaigners, such as William Beveridge, it was, according to historian Susan Pedersen, the \u0027fiscal and social framework Watson had fought for in the early 1920s\u0027 that did most to lay the foundation of Britain\u0027s welfare state.He was \u0027the man who did most to shape the welfare state in modern Britain.\u0027 Watson never sought the limelight.One contemporary account describes him as \u0027a short, almost insignificant man, bald, a roundish face, sandy moustache, eyes that squinted so that it was hard to guess where they were looking or to whom he was speaking.\u0027According to Pedersen, \u0027Watson understood perfectly that his near invisibility sustained his authority\u0027.Leading pioneer of the British anti-slavery campaigns of the late 18th and early 19th centuries: Thomas Clarkson, Abolitionist and campaigner (1760 - 1846)  In 2007, the 200th anniversary of the British parliament\u0027s passing of anti-slave trade legislation was commemorated with a major biopic of the independent MP and anti-slavery campaigner William Wilberforce. Arguably, however, it was another figure, Thomas Clarkson, who did most to kick-start the abolitionist cause in Britain at the turn of the 19th century.  Thomas Clarkson, Abolitionist and campaigner became a target of slave-traders, receiving several death threats and beatings, and it was not actually until 1787, that Wilberforce, as MP for Hull, became personally active in the abolitionist cause. A  biography produced shortly after their father\u0027s death in 1838, William Wilberforce\u0027s sons, Robert and Samuel, greatly downplayed Clarkson\u0027s contributionFrom the mid-1780s, Clarkson was instrumental in raising public awareness of the brutality of slavery, publishing essays, giving speeches, visiting trading ports and even stowing away on-board slave ships in order to gather evidence.In the course of his work, he soon became a target of slave-traders, receiving several death threats and beatings, and it was not actually until 1787, that Wilberforce, as MP for Hull, became personally active in the abolitionist cause.Whilst Wilberforce\u0027s stirring Parliamentary speeches were integral in putting the crucial legislative machinery in place, it was invariably the evidence acquired by Clarkson that gave them their moral weight.In a controversial biography produced shortly after their father\u0027s death in 1838, William Wilberforce\u0027s sons, Robert and Samuel, greatly downplayed Clarkson\u0027s contribution, depicting him as little more than an assistant to their more proactive and \u0027inely-inspired\u0027 father.Though Clarkson would subsequently publish a rebuttal of their \u0027cruel and unwarrantable attack\u0027 (prompting a private apology from the Wilberforce family), it was the latter\u0027s name that would become synonymous with the ending of the slave-trade in Britain.Walter Tull, Tottenham and Northampton footballer, first black officer in the British Army (1888 - 1918)  Tull, born in Folkestone in 1888 to a Barbadian father and English mother, first achieved fame as one of the first black players in the English Football League, playing for Tottenham Hotspur between 1909 and 1911, before moving to Northampton.In December 1914, Tull enlisted in the British army, rising through the ranks to become second-lieutenant despite a military injunction precluding \u0027negroes\u0027 from officer status.Though, as an officer, he was praised for his \u0027gallantry and coolness\u0027, Tull was later controversially denied a Military Cross. He was killed, in March 1918, aged 30, at the Battle of Bapaume in Northern France. His body was never found.  Walter Tull first achieved fame as one of the first black players in the English Football League, playing for Tottenham Hotspur between 1909 and 1911, before moving to Northampton. In December 1914, Tull enlisted in the British army, rising through the ranks to become second-lieutenant despite a military injunction precluding \u0027negroes\u0027 from officer status.In 2016, Tull\u0027s biographer Phil Vasili, uncovered evidence suggesting how Tull\u0027s senior officers may have colluded to prevent him from receiving the recognition to which he was, unquestionably, due. In a memo dated 19 February 1918, the Head of Recruitment to the War and Colonial Offices, General White, asserted that \u0027wooly headed n*****s\u0027 would not be required at the forthcoming spring offensive: \u0027We now refuse to post coloured men to \u0027white units\u0027, the memo went on, \u0027These n*****s must therefore go to native units if accepted.\u0027The first English king to issue a Law Code: King Æthelberht of Kent (c. 560 - 616)  Not only was Æthelberht the first English king to embrace Christianity, he was also the first to issue a written legal code, pre-empting what is normally invoked as the foundation stone of English constitutional law, Magna Carta, by over six hundred years.Conceivably, the Anglo-Saxon ruler - now forgotten - did as much to lay the foundations of early modern Britain as any English king prior to 1066.Like most Anglo-Saxon kings, exact details of Æthelberht\u0027s life and times are hard to verify.The most successful English politician of the fifteenth century: Lady Margaret Beaufort, Countess of Richmond and Derby (1433 - 1509) Twice-married by the age of twelve (and a widowed mother by the age of thirteen) Margaret devoted much of her life to the successful promotion of her only child, Henry Tudor to the English throne as Henry VII.Following Henry\u0027s victory over Richard III at Bosworth in 1485, Margaret was granted a degree of legal and social independence normally reserved only for Queens of England, including the right to hold property independent of her husband.  After allegedly being born on a slave ship, Ignatius Sancho was transported to England where he was a slave to the second Duke of Mantagu. But his intelligence did not go unnoticed and he was eventually set free and subsequently allowed to vote in electionsFirst known black man to vote in a British election: Ignatius Sancho, Writer and composer (c. 1729 - 1780) Allegedly born on board a slave ship in c. 1729 and orphaned by the age of two, Sancho was subsequently transported to England where he came under the watch of the second Duke of Montagu.Struck by the young slave\u0027s obvious intelligence, Montagu strove to educate Sancho, sharing books with him from his personal library, and cultivating his wider cultural tastes and interests. Following the duke\u0027s death in 1749, Sancho became butler to the duke\u0027s widow, one of the most important positions in an eighteenth-century aristocratic house. When the duchess died in 1751, she bequeathed Sancho an annuity of £30, as well as a year\u0027s salary to support himself with.Sancho\u0027s financial independence and status as a householder meant that he was the only known Afro-Briton qualified to vote in the parliamentary elections of 1774 and 1780.In addition to being the first known black man to vote in a British election he was also the first African to be afforded an obituary in the British press.Despite his apparent acceptance by eighteenth century English high society, Sancho\u0027s race and status as a former-slave became a source of considerable unease for those seeking to defend slavery against the growing abolitionist cause in the early nineteenth century.Not least, Sancho\u0027s deep intelligence and humanity went against those who claimed that Africans were somehow constitutionally incapable or deficient on this score.          Mary Anning achieved huge public attentions after discovering the first fossilised pterodactyl in Britain and her finding has even been said to have contributed to Darwin\u0027s theory of natural selectionPioneering Palaeontologist: Mary Anning, Fossil Collector, Palaeontologist (1799 - 1847) Born in Lyme Regis in 1799, Anning, from a young age, helped to supplement her family\u0027s modest income by selling fossils retrieved from cliffs near her childhood home.By her late teens she was making discoveries that would help to fundamentally reshape ideas of natural history and the evolution of species. In 1823, she discovered the first complete Plesiosaurus, complementing her previous discovery of a series of near-complete ichthyosaurs. In 1828, she achieved wide public attention with the discovery of the first fossilised Pterodactyl, or \u0027flying dragon\u0027, in Britain.Some scientists have suggested that Anning\u0027s findings contributed to Darwin\u0027s theory of natural selection. A poll carried out by the Royal Society in 2010, included Anning as one of the ten most influential women in British science.Anning struggled for due recognition in the male-dominated scientific community of the early 19th century, and her contributions to palaeontology went largely overlooked after her death.Many of the specimens she found were utilised by scientists and published in scientific journals without reference.She also had to overcome accusations of fraudulency from sceptical contemporaries such as the French naturalist Georges Cuvier, who accused her of fabricating new species by merging fossils from different animals.          Percy Pilcher was the first to invent the motor-powered aeroplane. But shortly after taking off in the flying machine, the tail snapped and he plunged 30ft to the ground and died from his injuries two days later (Nearly) invented the first powered aeroplane: Percy Pilcher, Pioneering Aviator (1866 - 1899)  By the end of the nineteenth century the international race to design and build a motor-powered aeroplane was heating up. Amongst those seeking to be the first to take flight was a British former naval engineer called Percy Pilcher.By September 30 1899, Pilcher was ready to demonstrate his prototype aircraft to a number of patrons and potential investors at Stanford Hall in Leicestershire. When problems with the engine prevented the launch from going ahead, Pilcher felt obliged to offer his audience a demonstration of his earlier Hawk glider. Shortly after take off the tail snapped, plunging Pilcher and his glider 30ft to the ground. He died from his injuries two days later.Four years later, the American brothers Orville and Wilbur Wright achieved immortal fame with the successful launch of their own biplane prototype in North Carolina.In 2003, researchers at the School of Aeronautics at Cranfield University successfully built and launched a triplane based, with minor modifications, on Pilcher\u0027s original designs.           Four years later after Pilcher\u0027s death, the American brothers Orville and Wilbur Wright achieved immortal fame with the successful launch of their own biplane prototype in North Carolina. Pilcher, pictured, was a partner in the firm Wilson and Pilcher Ltd, who began gliding in 1895Filmed by the BBC, the plane flew for one minute and 25 seconds, beating the first flight made by the Wright brothers in 1903 by 26 seconds.Pilcher\u0027s relative isolation as an independent engineer and early death at the age of 32 seems to have ensured that his designs and prototype died with him.The first qualified female surgeon and physician in Britain: Elizabeth Garrett Anderson, Physician, social campaigner, suffragette (1836 - 1917) Born in Whitechapel, East London, Garrett first came to prominence as a member of the Langham Place circle, an offshoot of the Society for Promoting the Employment of Women - a key focal point of the burgeoning mid-Victorian women\u0027s movement.In 1870, she became the first woman to obtain the qualification of Medical Doctor, and, in 1873, was finally admitted to membership of the British Medical Association.  Elizabeth Garret Anderson became the first woman to obtain the qualification of Medical Doctor, and, in 1873, was finally admitted to membership of the British Medical Association. She remained the only woman member of the BMA for 19 years following a vote to bar any further female admission in 1878Under pressure to resign after the association voted to bar any further female admission in 1878, she remained the only woman member of the BMA for nineteen years.In 1908, she was also elected as the first woman mayor in England, in the district of Aldeburgh.Anderson\u0027s numerous attempts to gain admission to study at medical school were denied.When, in 1865, she passed the society of Apothecaries examinations which allowed her to become a doctor, the society changed it rules to bar other women from entering the profession through this route.The British Medical Register also refused to recognise her medical degree from the University of Paris.Pioneer of inoculation against smallpox: Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, Aristocrat, writer and early pioneer of smallpox inoculation in England, (1689 - 1762) Whilst Edward Jenner (1749-1823), is often identified as the founder of modern vaccination techniques against smallpox, the 18th century aristocrat Mary Wortley Montagu arguably also deserves a place in the early history of immunology. It was during her time in Turkey in 1721, as wife of the British ambassador to the Ottoman court, that Lady Mary was first introduced to the local practice of variolation as a means of protection against smallpox.           Arstocrat Lady Mary Wortley Montagu is often identified as the founder of modern vaccination techniques against smallpox after being introduced to the local Turkish practice of variolation as a means of protection against smallpox. Her tenacity and commitment have been described by one historian as \u0027unparalleled in the annals of medical advance\u0027Returning to England, Lady Mary became an enthusiastic advocate of the Turkish method, fighting against considerable scepticism and resistance from doctors and wider society. Her tenacity and commitment have been described by one historian as \u0027unparalleled in the annals of medical advance.\u0027Lady Mary\u0027s promotion of the controversial foreign medical procedure prompted fierce debate in the British press and in wider society.Mary herself became subject to numerous slanderous and abusive attacks from journalists, medical practitioners and even clergymen.By the late 1720s, her infamy was such that people in the street would \u0027hoot at her as an unnatural mother\u0027.Working-class leader of the suffragette movement in early 20th century: Annie Kenney, Suffragette (1879 - 1953)           Annie Kenney is a little known Suffragette who was the first to speak and among the first to be arrested after she and Christbel Pankhurst unfurled a banner demanding the vote for women during a political meeting in 1905A name largely absent from the recent centenary commemorations of the 1918 Representation of the People Act was that of Annie Kenney. Born in the West Riding of Yorkshire in 1879, Kenney began her working life in cotton mill at the age of 10.Once described as \u0027after the Pankhursts\u0027, the most daring and influential of the Suffragettes\u0027, she was the first to speak, and among the first to be arrested, after she and Christabel Pankhurst unfurled a banner demanding the vote for women at a political meeting, attended by Sir Edward Grey and Winston Churchill, in Manchester in 1905 - an event which effectively launched the era of suffragette militancy.The early labour movement\u0027s focus on industrial solidarity over women\u0027s rights, combined with her class meant it was harder for Kenney to achieve the same kind of recognition and authority as that produced by the \u0027upper-class\u0027 Pankhursts.Kenney\u0027s brother Robert, would later accuse his sister and other suffragettes of \u0027robbing the Socialist movement of its finest elements and wasting them in a fight for the vote, which was of little or no use compared with industrial solidarity and the making of Socialist converts.\u0027Pioneer in the theory and design of suspension bridges: Sarah Guppy, Inventor, Social Reformer (1770 - 1852)  In 1811, Guppy secured a patent for \u0027a new mode of constructing and erecting bridges and rail-roads without arches or sterlings, whereby the danger of being washed away by floods is avoided.\u0027The patent went on to describe a form of hanging bridge, connected by interlocking framing, which removed the need for stanchions in the riverbed itself. Guppy\u0027s proposed design was largely intended as a way of overcoming the difficulties of bridging the Bristol Avon - later famously addressed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel, who built the world-famous Clifton Suspension Bridge.A variant of her patent was also later asserted to have been employed by Thomas Telford in his construction of the Menai Suspension Bridge in 1826.Prohibitive social mores of the early 18th and 19th centuries, particularly those related to the place of women, as well as Guppy\u0027s own modesty all helped to ensure that her contributions to 19th century British industrial innovation were largely overlooked.She once suggested \u0027it is unpleasant to speak of oneself - it may seem boastful particularly in a woman.\u0027                                                        "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/17/14/4C52405400000578-5740723-image-a-14_1526564290327.jpg","title":"Good Morning Britain ditches Meghan Markles sister law nephews","story":"Tracey Dooley, who is Meghan\u0027s sister-in-law, and her son Tyler had flown into London to give insight during the day, despite not being invited to the ceremony  The family is staying at the H10 hotel in Waterloo, where rooms are available for as little as £70 per night   Tyler Dooley and his girlfriend Sandra Bazan are pictured leaving their hotel in Waterloo, London yesterdayArmed with no less than 13 suitcases, the family were pictured arriving at Heathrow airport on Monday having flown in from their home in Oregon.A cheerful Tracy could even be seen flashing a peace sign to photographers as she made her way from security.Shortly after arriving in London, Tyler began posting image on his Facebook page, sharing snaps of a few landmarks, as well as an image showing  his hotel room.\u0027I have always cared for my father\u0027: Meghan breaks her...Met the in-laws?

It is thought she will meet the Queen, Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall, as well as the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, in the next 24 hours.On the night before the wedding she and her daughter will move with the bridal party to historic Cliveden, a 25-minute drive from Windsor Castle.It is widely thought that should her former husband, with whom she is said to be \u0027barely on speaking terms\u0027, fail to show, it will be Miss Ragland who has the task of walking her daughter down the aisle.

Events in the Royal Wedding drama are moving faster even than Thomas Jnr does when someone offers to buy a round of drinks at the Cedarwood Saloon, his local bar in Grants Pass, Oregon.However, with 24 hours to go before Meghan and Harry tie the knot, the state of play is as follows: the bride’s father — shamed by the revelation that he colluded with a paparazzi photographer — now lies in a Mexican hospital, recovering from a heart operation made necessary, he claims, by his son’s bad-mouthing of Meghan.          Family at war: Meghan at 11 (far left) with her father, Samantha and nephews Tyler and ThomasMeanwhile, Thomas Jnr’s sons, Thomas, 27, who runs a Domino’s Pizza franchise with his husband, and brother Tyler, 25, a cannabis farmer (it’s legal to grow the drug in Oregon) have indeed pitched up in London (with their glammed-up mother, Tracy Dooley, in tow).Tyler plans to cash in on his association with Meghan by launching a super-strong strain of cannabis called Markle’s Sparkle.They are here to watch the wedding as ‘pundits’ in an ITV studio. Or, at least, they were until yesterday when, wisely, we might think, executives at Good Morning Britain reportedly decided to drop them.          Meghan Markle\u0027s half-brother Thomas Junior wrote a poisonous ‘open letter’ to Harry  branding his sister ‘a jaded, shallow, conceited woman  Mr Markle Jr had recently penned an ‘open letter’ and told Harry: ‘As more time passes to your royal wedding, it became very clear that this is the biggest mistake in royal wedding history\u0027As for Meghan’s paternal uncles, Bishop Fred Markle and his brother Mick, a retired diplomat, these respectable septuagenarians will remain in America, along with various other snubbed relatives.Among them is Meghan’s maternal uncle Joffre, a graphic designer, who is actually two years younger than Meghan and is the product of her late maternal grandfather Alvin’s second marriage, to a lady named Ava Burrows.As he and Meghan are a similar age, and grew up in the same neighbourhood of Los Angeles, Joffre was genuinely close to her when they were children and resumed their friendship when she was an actress in Hollywood.Though he has shown admirable discretion during the pre-wedding hoopla, declining many interview requests, he, too, has been overlooked, leaving his mother feeling understandably hurt.    Meghan Markle pictured as a baby being held by her father Thomas who will not attend the royal wedding following a heart operation          Meghan Markle (right) with her sister Samantha (left) who has been snubbed from the wedding on Saturday          Samantha Markle gave a bombshell interview to US media where she insisted she had \u0027freedom of speech\u0027 and the right to criticise her half-sister Meghan‘I want everything to work out and wish them a great day,’ Ava Burrows told me this week. ‘Even though I might not be happy about how it has been handled as far as my son is concerned.’The retired teacher added: ‘That’s my boy who’s been left out and I’m a momma bear!’So, flying in the face of Meghan’s brother’s fanciful prediction last May, it seems — apart from her mother, Doria, who is expected to walk her up the aisle tomorrow — there will be no place in the chapel for anyone in the Markle family. The one thing Thomas Jnr got right when he contemplated the likely guest list, however, was that there would not be a pew for his sister, Samantha.It wasn’t difficult to forecast her absence, though, because Samantha, 53, who suffers from multiple sclerosis and uses a wheelchair, had already portrayed Meghan as ‘narcissistic and selfish’ and claimed her half-sister had disowned her because of her disability.Since then, her rants — delivered by the U.S. celebrity news website TMZ, which has also become the chosen mouthpiece for Thomas Markle Snr — have grown more wounding and bizarre by the day.          Prince Harry and Meghan Markle arrive at Windsor Castle ahead of their big dayYesterday, hitting back at Meghan’s reported pleas for her to stop sniping, she even invoked the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, saying angrily: ‘She’s not going to tell me that I can’t speak about my life. I’m not going to take it. She’s way out of her league . . . there is something in this country called freedom of speech. Meghan doesn’t have a copyright on that.’What, then, of Thomas Jnr? Having written a poisonous ‘open letter’ to Harry just over a fortnight ago, branding his sister ‘a jaded, shallow, conceited woman’ who would ‘make a joke’ of the Prince and the Royal Family and urging him to call off the ‘fake fairytale’ wedding, he appears to have had a truly Damascene conversion.The 52-year-old jobbing glazier has been flown to Britain by a redtop tabloid — no doubt, in return for yet another fat pay cheque — and was yesterday photographed posing beside one of the Queen’s guardsmen at Windsor Castle, his bleary eyes filled with awe.He now claims he hadn’t meant to hurt Meghan when he penned that cruel letter, published in a U.S. magazine, insisting he wrote it only because he and his family had been under intense pressure since the wedding was announced and he wanted to ‘shame the Palace’ into helping them.Audaciously, in his father’s absence, he is now trying to play the family’s elder statesman.  Meghan\u0027s nephew Tyler Dooley (pictured left) and his girlfriend Sandra Bazan (right) have not been invited to the wedding but were arrived at Heathrow airport on Monday          Megan\u0027s sister-in-law Tracey and nephew Tyler Dooley are pictured leaving a hotel in Waterloo‘The fact Dad’s not well enough to travel makes me want more than ever to be as supportive as I can to Meg,’ he drawled. ‘All I want is to see Meg happy and I hope she has found that with Harry.’Forgetting that he shared the family home with Meghan only briefly, when he was a teenager, and hasn’t spoken to his half-sister for many years, he added: ‘Knowing her as well as I do, and despite her job, there will be no acting on Saturday for sure. She’ll be unable to hide her happiness.’Quite what Meghan must be feeling as she prepares for the biggest day of her life, knowing her troublesome brother and various members of his clan lurk not a million miles from St George’s Chapel, we can but imagine.From the tranquillity of her home in the Californian desert — where I visited her last year — Ava Burrows summed up the car crash events of recent days with customary sagacity: ‘Family dynamics can be trying under normal circumstances but, in this family, under these circumstances, they are just plain crazy.’Weary of the hype, incidentally, Mrs Burrows has decided against getting up at 3am, West Coast time, to watch the wedding.           Tracey\u0027s son Tyler is developing a strain of cannabis called \u0027Markle\u0027s Sparkle\u0027 in the US state of Oregon, known for its relaxed drug laws    Tyler with his girlfriend Sandra (left) and with his mother Tracy, rightIndeed, though she will record the televised coverage for her invalid mother, who lives with her, she says she might never view it.The same goes for Meghan’s Uncle Mick, the retired diplomat.Puzzled and upset at being ignored (not least because he used his influence to get Meghan an internship at the U.S. Embassy in Argentina after she graduated), the 78-year-old, who lives in Florida, five time zones back from London, has also decided against setting his alarm.Whatever we might think of Meghan’s decision to exclude her family — be they blameless or otherwise — it means we can expect a scene of stark disparity in the chapel tomorrow.The right-hand side, where the groom’s contingent traditionally sit, will be packed with Harry’s family members, close and distant. The left, reserved for the bride’s guests, is likely to be filled with her high-flown new circle of friends, such as tennis queen Serena Williams, Jessica Mulroney, daughter-in-law of the former Canadian prime minister, and her co-stars in the TV drama Suits.          Thomas Markle admitted to staging  paparazzi photos (pictured) with an agency for money          Thomas Markle is seen on surveillance video entering an internet cafe with photographer Jeff Rayner to set up staged photosOn which side of the chapel David and Victoria Beckham will be seated, we can’t be sure. For those unacquainted with the Markle family’s chequered history, perhaps I should explain how this extraordinary state of affairs came about.The Markles are ided by many long-standing feuds, but the most bitter is between Thomas Jnr and Samantha, who loathe one another with a vengeance.The children of Meghan’s father’s first marriage, they were raised in Chicago — where Thomas Snr worked as a TV lighting technician — but when they were very young, their parents orced and they moved to live in the backwoods of New Mexico with their mother, Roslyn.Thomas Snr, meanwhile, decamped to Hollywood, working on the hit TV series Married With Children and marrying Meghan’s mother, Doria, 12 years his junior, who was temping at the studio.When Samantha was in her early teens, with visions of forging an acting career, she went to live with them, followed by Thomas Jnr.            The future princess\u0027 family are a mix of colourful characters that include a reformed alcoholic, a bishop, and even a cannabis farmerAs I learned when researching Meghan’s life story, however, the arrangement was a disaster from the outset. By many accounts, Samantha was deeply jealous of her baby half-sister (though she strenuously denies this), feeling that Meghan was claiming all her father’s attention.Matters worsened as Meghan grew older and her acting career began to blossom — while Samantha’s foundered.According to Roslyn, 71, Samantha is ‘not a nice person’ and also resented Doria, allegedly telling friends her stepmother was ‘the maid because she is black’.Samantha has since had an unhappy life. She was first married to a lawyer from Virginia, but they split up and he took custody of their two children.Her second marriage was also a failure, and her third child, daughter Noel, 19, despises her.She claims to have been a model and actress, though, if we believe her brother, she only ever had one or two bit-parts, courtesy of her father, and one modelling assignment, for a jeans commercial.Thomas Jnr says she also worked as a shop assistant, before joining the U.S. Air Force, but claims that she has sponged shamelessly off her father, contributing to his recent bankruptcy.With a tell-all book about Meghan in the pipeline, Samantha now calls herself a writer and ‘mental health counsellor’. She was diagnosed with MS in 2008.Thomas Jnr’s life has been no less difficult. After working as a lowly-paid Hollywood prop-shifter (again, thanks to his father’s connections), he drifted from job to job, and woman to woman, before marrying Tracy.  On the go: Meghan\u0027s mother Doria was picked up at her California home as she made her way to LAX on TuesdayThough they had two sons, Tyler and Thomas — or ‘TJ’, as he is known — he says the relationship was so fraught that they lived ‘as man and wife’ for only a few months.As Tracy is reportedly a recovering alcoholic, and he has long-standing problems with drink, this isn’t surprising.In fairness, Tracy has sprung to her ex-husband’s defence in recent months, not least when he was arrested for threatening Darlene with a gun. But TJ is less forgiving, saying he feels humiliated by his father’s erratic behaviour, and his outbursts about Meghan, and that his father and aunt Samantha are both ‘crazy’.Given the goings-on in recent days, we might think this something of an understatement — and you can bet your life there is plenty more embarrassment to come from the madcap Markles.Perhaps Meghan is wondering whether she should have invited the whole sorry lot of them. After all, it might have been better to have these loose cannons inside the wedding hall, rather than taking pot shots from outside."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/18/14/4C661F4100000578-5742749-image-a-57_1526650912733.jpg","title":"Smiling fianc e flashing ring Meghan leaves family drama behind","story":"    Meghan Markle and Prince Harry smile and wave as they leave their Kensington Palace home to head to Windsor today.

The Duke was taken to the private King Edward VII hospital in central London on April 3, for surgery to replace his joint with a prosthetic implant.He underwent the planned procedure the following day and left hospital on April 13.The duke, who retired from royal duties in August 2017, has since continued his recovery in Windsor.His appearance at tomorrow\u0027s wedding will please the royal fans, with whom he is extremely poplar.                                                     Yesterday they witnessed a full rehearsal in which a carriage and members of the armed forces paraded through the streets of Windsor. Meghan has pleaded for her 73-year-old father, who is recovering from heart surgery in Mexico after revelations about his alleged collusion with a paparazzi photographer, to be given \u0027space\u0027. In the statement, which she is said to have written herself, Miss Markle, 36, said: \u0027Sadly, my father will not be attending our wedding.\u0027I have always cared for my father and hope he can be given the space he needs to focus on his health.\u0027I would like to thank everyone who has offered generous messages of support. Please know how much Harry and I look forward to sharing our special day with you on Saturday.\u0027 The actress also appeared to reject criticism by her siblings that she had failed to do enough to support the reclusive Thomas Markle, saying she had \u0027always cared\u0027 for him. However, her mother, Doria Ragland, who will accompany her to the chapel and who is due to meet the Queen today, is tipped for the role. Miss Markle\u0027s future father-in-law, Prince Charles, and her closest male friend, Soho House director Markus Anderson, have also been mooted.Amid criticism from some in the extended Markle family, sources close to Miss Markle yesterday insisted that she and Harry, 33, had offered both her parents substantial \u0027support and advice\u0027 as to how to handle the global interest since they started dating in 2016.And friends told the Mail that contrary to claims by her half-siblings, Samantha Markle and Thomas Markle Jnr, that she had left their intensely private father to deal with the paparazzi on his own, she had been in \u0027frequent\u0027 touch with him by phone and text, including in recent days.It is understood Mr Markle told his daughter personally that he would not be medically fit enough to fly to the UK.    The Prince of Wales is at Buckingham Palace today where he made author and broadcaster Melvyn Bragg,  a Companion of Honour as news emerged he will give Meghan away          Excitement ahead of the wedding is reaching fever pitch today as Americans and Brits pose outside Windsor Castle      It was claimed yesterday that he was recovering after having three stents implanted in arteries following a heart attack at home in Mexico eight days ago, and that he had said it would \u0027take a long time to heal\u0027.

They were also unable to say when Prince Harry would meet his new father-in-law. Although the couple have been dating for two years, the prince has only ever spoken to him by phone.Yesterday\u0027s announcement came at the end of a truly remarkable few days, in which Kensington Palace was accused of failing to get a grip of the situation, leaving Thomas Markle to brief the US gossip website TMZ about his plans.  Even Buckingham Palace courtiers have started looking at the website for the latest updates.  But as the final preparations were put into place yesterday afternoon, Miss Markle and Harry appeared to be all smiles.The couple attended their last wedding rehearsal at St George\u0027s Chapel in Windsor with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and their children, Prince George and Princess Charlotte, who are page boy and bridesmaid. Miss Markle looked radiant despite the strain of the past week, wearing a white £285 Boss bodysuit and £7,000 Birks diamond earrings.Although the Queen arrived at Windsor Castle for the weekend while the wedding party was there, she is understood not to have taken part.Friends said last night that despite the drama of the past few days, Miss Markle was excited about the wedding and looking forward to exchanging vows with her prince.

Specialist teams are also patrolling the Thames.Police and soldiers carrying automatic weapons will also line the streets ready to fire if necessary and are already patrolling the roads, which have crash barriers used to stop vehicle-based terror attacks.With the UK\u0027s terror threat level at severe the cost of security for the first major royal wedding since 2011 is expected to reach up to £30million and the bill will be picked up by the taxpayer.It is Thames Valley Police\u0027s biggest ever operation and they are relying heavily on Scotland Yard and MI5 for support.It came as superfans camped on the streets overnight to secure their spots to see the procession through the Berkshire town tomorrow.              Police teams are even patrolling Windsor along the Thames today in an  extraordinary security operation ahead of the royal wedding    Police spotters and snipers are lining the 2.6mile route set to be followed by Meghan and Harry and are ready to shoot to kill            A police officer watches on from the rooftops of Windsor during one of Britain\u0027s biggest security operations for years            Soldiers have also been drafted in to secure a ring of steel around Windsor Castle ahead of the biggest UK royal wedding since 2011            Armed officers are on patrol and MailOnline understands there also undercover officers and MI5 ready to act if needed            Superfans camped on the streets overnight to secure their spots to see the procession through the Berkshire town tomorrowArmed police and specially trained sniffer dogs are patrolling the streets of  the royal town, with squadrons of uniformed officers with machine guns toured the town in rotation.Their colleagues are checking drains, bins and any other potential hiding places for bombs as the Berkshire town was turned into a fortress.Thames Valley Police and the Metropolitan Police - who guard the Royals –  used the dress rehearsal yesterday to assess any potential security threats or bottlenecks and crowd surges.As many as 100,000 visitors are expected to flock to the Berkshire town this weekend - which has a population of 35,000 - to catch a glimpse of the newlyweds.  Wedding planning service Bridebook say it could cost as much as £32million to ensure the event remains safe.The amount is more than double the security needed for the 1981 wedding between Prince Charles and Diana Spencer which was estimated to have cost £4million - which equates to around £12million today.Extra police from around Britain are being called upon to help ensure the event goes off without a hitch, as crowds will fill Windsor to catch a glimpse of the royals.  Since Prince William’s wedding the UK has experienced a surge in terror threats, meaning the cost of Harry’s nuptials outside of the city will be much higher.The couple’s decision to invite more than 2,000 members of the public to attend celebrations at Windsor Castle has also increased security costs. The Queen revealed has said she and the rest of the royal family will pay for the traditional wedding costs like the ceremony, flowers, music and the reception - but security is likely to be paid in full for by the taxpayer.             A police boat cruises the Thames in Windsor today as part of the £30m operation to keep the event secure            Sniffer dogs are checking the streets while police are checking drains and removing bins to stop any attack on the royal wedding            Crash barriers are also in place in Windsor to stop a terrorist attacking crowds using a vehicle  \u0027Prince Charles doesn\u0027t have a daughter so he must be VERY happy\u0027: Social media overflows with praise for Meghan\u0027s \u0027touching\u0027 decision to ask her father-in-law to give her away... although feminists claim the decision is \u0027sexist\u0027Royal fans today spoke of their joy for Prince Charles after it was revealed he will step in for the father of the bride and walk Meghan Markle down the aisle.The Prince of Wales will give his soon-to-be daughter-in-law away when she marries Prince Harry tomorrow at St George\u0027s Chapel in Windsor Castle.Meghan, 36, asked her future father-in-law to accompany her on the way to the altar after her father Thomas Markle had to pull out following heart surgery.Responding to the announcement by Kensington Palace this morning, royal fans praised the \u0027fantastic\u0027 decision and said they were delighted for Charles.             Royal fans have mostly reacted positively to the news, speaking of their joy for Prince CharlesOne said: \u0027What a lovely thing. Charles himself has no biological daughters but he will definitely be gaining one tomorrow. It will be a very touching moment.\u0027Another from New South Wales, Australia, tweeted: \u0027What a wonderful blessing for them both. Something Charles thought he would never be able to do.\u0027Her mother may not have been comfortable doing this. Whatever the reason, it is fantastic. Many blessings and prayers for both Harry and Meghan.\u0027And a third said: \u0027I knew it would be Prince Charles. I was hoping for her mum to do it, but I guess she wanted to keep things as traditional as possible. Great choice!\u0027However, not everyone was happy with the announcement. Aimee Day tweeted: \u0027No, it should have been her mum to do it. She brought her up and she should do it.             Others are not so impressed by the decision, with some claiming it is a \u0027sexist\u0027 move\u0027In general I think the mother\u0027s should do it anyway. After all, in most situations the mother does everything for their child over the father - in my experience.\u0027And Rachel Douce added: \u0027Disappointing that Prince Charles is walking Meghan down the aisle. Perfect opportunity for the royals to show how modern and not sexist they are and let Doria do it, but no.\u0027Mr Markle was forced to pull out of performing the fatherly duty after undergoing heart surgery in a dramatic upset just two days before the wedding.The actress\u0027s mother Doria Ragland had been tipped to perform the role. But Harry\u0027s father is far more experienced at appearing at big public events amid scrutiny.Wedding-watchers camped outside Windsor Castle in readiness for the festivities said they felt her soon-to-be father-in-law stepping in was a \u0027nice gesture\u0027.The announcement from Kensington Palace on Friday morning came with just 24 hours to go until the big day, with final preparations well under way in Windsor. Windsor visitor Leslie Haynes, from Washington, said: \u0027I was surprised actually. I knew that Prince Charles was in the running. I just assumed it would be her mother.\u0027But it was Meghan\u0027s approval and choice and so we support that, and, as we say, the next King of England is going to walk her down the aisle.\u0027The 58-year-old, who is camping  opposite the castle, said she was \u0027somewhat\u0027 disappointed that Miss Ragland would not accompany Meghan to the altar.She added: \u0027But I have to say that it\u0027s her choice so we\u0027re happy for her. She is going to be the happiest woman in the world tomorrow so how could we be disappointed about that?\u0027Margaret Phipps, 25, from Texas, said: \u0027She has such a close relationship with her mum, so I think it is surprising to some people. But I think it\u0027s a nice gesture. \u0027He (Charles) doesn\u0027t have a daughter that he\u0027d ever be able to walk down the aisle. And it just sort of shows her transition into the royal family.\u0027She\u0027s really becoming a part of that family with him kind of acting as the father figure in situations, so I personally think it\u0027s nice.\u0027Sylvia Horn, 61, from Nashville, said it is \u0027wonderful\u0027, adding: \u0027It\u0027s usually a gentleman that does it.\u0027 \u0027I fully approve since Charles is going to be her father-in-law,\u0027 she said.  "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/17/22/4C6025CE00000578-0-image-m-16_1526593425730.jpg","title":"Motorists urged clean air conditioning units","story":"    Motorists are being urged to clean the air conditioning units in their cars after researchers found potentially dangerous bacteria living and breeding in systemsSwabs of 15 air conditioning filters were taken from cars across the UK and sent for laboratory analysis.

Bacillus subtilis are normally found in the gastrointestinal tract of humans and some mammals. They generally do not cause disease but have been known to cause septicaemia in a patient with leukaemia.Bacillus is more dangerous and has links with a wide range of infections including meningitis, abscesses and septicaemia.          Swabs of 15 air conditioning filters were taken from cars across the UK and sent for laboratory analysis. Micro-organisms were detected in all of the filters tested at London Metropolitan UniversityA car’s air con works by mixing fresh air from outside with a refrigerant and the mixture turns into liquid as it is cooled. It is then turned into vapour as it travels through evaporation coils and blown into the cabin as cool air. It is the evaporator in the system that provides perfect conditions for bacteria, mould and fungi to build up and thrive. Although the car filter will prevent many pollutants entering the passenger compartment, it will not stop all micro-organisms.The research was commissioned by Kwik Fit, which urged drivers to clean their air conditioning systems at least once every two years.On average, the test found 1.6 different strains of mico-organisms within the filters.Drivers in Plymouth had the most contaminated cars, with an average of 2.3 varieties of micro-organism per vehicle. Dundee closely followed, with each filter having on average two strains of micro-organism.Coming in just under the overall average figure and at the bottom of the table was Cardiff, with an average of one type of micro-organism per filter tested.Dr Paul Matewele, a senior lecturer specialising in microbiology at London Metropolitan, said: ‘Some of the bacteria found has links to animals, the gastrointestinal tract of humans and some infections that could cause a lot of harm to iniduals, especially those with a compromised immune system.‘The study highlights that air conditioning systems are suitable breeding grounds for bacteria and therefore underlines the importance of cleaning and replacing filters.‘I’m sure if car owners knew what they were blowing out of their air conditioning vents they would think twice before switching them on this summer.’  "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/18/00/4C60D7DE00000578-0-image-m-26_1526600041047.jpg","title":"Britain double military presence Afghanistan send extra 400 troops","story":"    An extra 400 military personnel could be sent to the war zone as part of a Nato training mission.

They normally dissolve over time.\u0027I know when I had my last transplant they were talking about where they were going to put it.          Darren He works as a social media manager, which also allows him flexibility around hospital appointments and working remotely\u0027As it stands I can\u0027t tell how many kidneys I\u0027ve inside me, whether it\u0027s five or three or one.\u0027To take out a kidney which is causing problems is longer surgery and takes longer to recover from. They never felt it necessary to take one out.\u0027His problems were detected shortly after he was born, and he was spent his entire life being treated for the potentially fatal condition.Darren said: \u0027When I got home, my parents knew there was a problem. All I would do is sleep all day. I didn\u0027t wake up for feeding.\u0027When they would feed me it would drop out of my mouth.\u0027He was initially taken to the family\u0027s GP in Kettering, Northants, and from there was rushed to Great Ormond Street Hospital where he was diagnosed with chronic kidney failure.\u0027My first transplant was aged five years old,\u0027 Darren said. \u0027It has been crazy.\u0027At times the demands of his medical condition meant he was visiting a hospital three times a week, and was on dialysis three times a day.A catheter was inserted into his lower stomach and a CAPD dialysis functioned like a mechanical kidney.But medical developments have made hugely positive changes for Darren, allowing him to receive treatment at home in Milton Keynes, Bucks, when necessary.He works as a social media manager, which also allows him flexibility around hospital appointments and working remotely.          The couple were desperate for a child and began to investigate infertility treatment - but then Amanda became pregnant unexpectedly and gave birth in June, 2014. \u0027We had two beautiful children naturally, they are a blessing,\u0027 Darren saidDarren said: \u0027With the medical condition I couldn\u0027t really hold down a job as I was spending so much time in hospital.\u0027I lost one of my kidneys because I went back to work too soon.\u0027One day I felt really tired and lethargic and the doctors said \u0027I\u0027m sorry, your kidney is not working.\u0027Miraculously he was able to become a father without using IVF, which he and Amanda feared they may have to resort to.\u0027The doctors said it was unlikely I would be able to have children,\u0027 Darren said.\u0027Nothing was happening, then we went to the doctors.\u0027They said with your medical condition it is unlikely you will be able to have children naturally.\u0027The couple were desperate for a child and began to investigate infertility treatment - but then Amanda became pregnant unexpectedly and gave birth in June, 2014.\u0027We had two beautiful children naturally, they are a blessing,\u0027 Darren said.He had been honest with his 21-year-old bride about the prognosis, which was uncertain at the time they tied the knot.Darren said: \u0027My wife is really supportive. We got married when she was 21, and she was on the cusp of her career as a makeup artist.\u0027Before we got married, I said \u0027this is my condition, I don\u0027t know how long I will last.\u0027\u0027But the crazy woman still married me.\u0027All the organs Darren received apart from the most recent one from Lee had come from the organ donor register.But Darren does not believe that the opt-out system for the regist, which has been implemented in Scotland and Wales, should be introduced in England.He said: \u0027I do feel it should be down to choice.\u0027Nobody should feel pressured or obligated to do it.\u0027It is a decision that should not be made lightly.\u0027He added: \u0027For people who say they don\u0027t want to go under the knife and take time off work, it is not that bad.\u0027My friend Lee, who gave me my last kidney, was in and out of hospital in three days.\u0027Now they can do keyhole surgery.\u0027He has now written a memoir, How I Survived Five Kidney Transplants And Won. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/18/02/4C618B0C00000578-0-image-a-52_1526605719229.jpg","title":"Catwoman Jocelyn Wildenstein files BANKRUPTCY claims no savings stock","story":"    Feed the kitty: Jocelyn Wildenstein (above) filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection earlier this month in federal court, just 19 years after pocketing $2.5 billion in her orce          Cat-astrophe: The socialite (above in Dec. 2016) has no checking or savings accounts, has not invested in any stocks or bonds and set up no retirement or pensions funds she claims in the filingWildenstein does believe that her assets outweigh the amount owed to her creditors by about $10 million, though there are a few red flags in the filing.The most glaring seems to be Wildenstein\u0027s estimates for the value of her wardrobe ($1,000) and  jewelry ($0).Those figures in the legal document are despite the fact that she is seldom seen without a large fur, luxury handbag or her 32-carat diamond engagement ring while strolling the streets of Manhattan.Bobbi Kristina expressed a desire to kill Whitney Houston...\u0027Wolf of Wall Street\u0027 Jordan Belfort is accused in court of...Share this articleThe filing comes after an involuntary petition was filed against Wildenstein by three of her creditors including the Board of Managers at Trump World Tower Condominium, who are in the process of foreclosing on the three apartments she owns in the building.The other two petitioners were the law firms of Carter Ledyard \u0026amp Milburn and Matalon Shweky Elman, who claim to be owed  $124,605.46 and $78,474.23 respectively for unpaid legal services.Wildenstein had until May 4 to respond to their filing, at which time she submitted her Chapter 11 forms in US Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York. The socialite states in the filing that she will have a better chance of clawing her back and paying off her debts through Chapter 11 protection rather than liquidation of her assets. Wildenstein\u0027s lists 12 creditors with unsecured claims against her, including:  the contractors who did work on her Manhattan apartments ($175,000) the owner of a Beverly Hills bungalow she rented back in 2014 ($165,000) a Manhattan furniture store ($80,000) American Express ($70,000) her architect ($25,000) a real estate agency ($12,000) and a storage company ($8,000).          Cat got your rung? Wildenstein says her jewelry is worthless despite owning a 32-carat diamond ring (above)There are four law firms who in total are owed over $273,000 as well as $30,431.00 that the socialite is paying to the New York State Department of Labor for what she describes as \u0027law obligations.\u0027 The list of creditors whose claims have been secured by property is shorter, which just four comapnies listed.The values are far higher however, with Wildenstein owing $179,000 to the Board of Managers at Trump World Tower Condominium and $4.6 million to Castellan Capital, which is by far the highest debt incurred by the socialite.Those are both secured by her $11.75 million apartments.Wildenstein also owes $38,000 to Chase Auto Finance, which is secured by her 2006 Bentley, and $700,000 to a Manhattan storage company, which is secured by her furniture.That last debt is another red flag, as she previously claims her furniture to be worth only $100,000, which would not be enough to cover that debt. Her total personal property is valued at $16,386,100 and largely comprised of her apartment and the $4.5 million she has yet to receive from her orce, despite her ex Alec having passed away in 2008.The good news is that this amount exceeds the $6,380,080 she claims to owe her 16 creditors.Wildenstein, who is already involved in court proceedings with many of her creditors, states that her goal is pay all parties back the money they are owed.

I would always find out last. She was thinking that she could fix her face like a piece of furniture. Skin does not work that way. But she wouldn’t listen,\u0027 said Alec at the time.Things got so bad between the two during the separation that Alec\u0027s father Daniel had Jocelyn banned from the family properties - a New York town house, their Paris chateau (the largest private residence in the city at the time), the 66,000-acre Ol Jogi ranch, and the private compound in the British Virgin Islands.At the same time her credit cards were cut off and had her monthly allowance lowered to just $50,000, which her lawyers fought in court.That all changed however with her massive settlement in 1999, which has allowed her to live comfortably ever since.Jocelyn and Alec first met when she was 31 and they were both on safari with friends in Kenya at Ol Jogi.\u0027A lion had to be killed at a neighbor’s ranch,\u0027 Alec recalled in Vanity Fair.\u0027The night before, Jocelyn asked, Could I go with you? I said, As long as you keep your mouth shut.\u0027The next day they went and killed the lion, rode motorcycles and kissed for the very first time, with Jocelyn calling the moment \u0027quite intense.\u0027She was born and raised in Switzerland and, according to Alec, had dated some very high-profile men before him.Among the men she had been linked with were European filmmaker Sergio Gobbi, Cyril Piguet, and Saudi arms dealer Adnan Khashoggi.The pair eloped to Las Vegas in 1978, and one year later they both went in for their first plastic surgery operation - his-and-hers eye lifts.\u0027I don’t think I’ve known her when she wasn’t healing from something,\u0027 said a friend of Jocelyn in 1998.Her looks then became more and more feline, though Jocelyn said the resemblance was always there.\u0027If I show you pictures of my grandmother, what you see is these eyes - cat eyes - and high cheekbones,\u0027 she said.\u0027I don\u0027t think there\u0027s anything wrong with it, and other than tightening up my appearance never change,\u0027 said Wildenstein in a 1999 interview with New York.\u0027My clothes, I am still the same size when I was 16 years old. You like to stay young - to stay healthy. I do a lot of waterskiing with my son.\u0027She also said she had never had her nose done.The couple had two children early in their relationship, Diane and Alec Jr., but Alec\u0027s father never warmed to Jocelyn.\u0027My father checks things out. My father tried to warn me,\u0027 said Alec of his estranged wife back in 1998.Their relationship took a turn when Jocelyn returned to New York City from Kenya and showed up unannounced at the couple\u0027s New York City townhouse, despite her husband asking that she not enter the residence.He pointed a gun at either Jocelyn or one of her bodyguards, police were called and Alec spent the night in prison.Alec was also reportedly in bed with a young Russian woman at the time.After Alec\u0027s arrest Jocelyn was allowed to use the house while he stayed at the Four Seasons, but complained in court papers that she was unable to use the stove and therefore needed money to hire help.Her lawyer called her a \u0027prisoner in her own home\u0027 while asking for $200,000 a month.New York toured the home at the time, revealing that there was a glass case above Jocelyn\u0027s bath to hold May Moon, her pet monkey.The pool room meanwhile had tanks filled with sand sharks, spotted eels, and neon terras.At the time Alec had been seeing a young Russian named Yelena Jarikoaa, who was just 20, but that fizzled out within a year and he eventually met and then married Stoupakova. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/15/01/4C3EA1AE00000578-0-image-a-19_1526343367315.jpg","title":"Incredible moment NASA astronaut realizes hes left memory card HOME spacewalk","story":"The forgetful astronaut was either Drew Feustel (left) or Ricky Arnold (right).

Staying in the hospital a few more days. Not allowed to get excited\u0027 and his children said he is \u0027heartbroken\u0027 to miss the wedding.Mr Markle said his doctors needed to \u0027go in and clear blockage, repair damage, and put a stent where it is needed\u0027 during the operation.His daughter Samantha, who has a poor relationship with Meghan, claims her father is \u0027upset and alone\u0027 following his surgery.But there is some confusion over his care as sources close to the Markle family said he had already been diagnosed with a heart condition and was due to undergo planned surgery to fit a stent, the same operation Prince Philip underwent in 2011, early next week – on his return from London.Amid criticism from some in the extended Markle family, sources close to Miss Markle yesterday insisted that she and Harry, 33, had offered both her parents substantial \u0027support and advice\u0027 as to how to handle the global interest since they started dating in 2016.And friends told the Mail that contrary to claims by her half-siblings, Samantha Markle and Thomas Markle Jnr, that she had left their intensely private father to deal with the paparazzi on his own, she had been in \u0027frequent\u0027 touch with him by phone and text, including in recent days.It is understood Mr Markle told his daughter personally that he would not be medically fit enough to fly to the UK.   It was claimed yesterday that he was recovering after having three stents implanted in arteries following a heart attack at home in Mexico eight days ago, and that he had said it would \u0027take a long time to heal\u0027.In return, Miss Markle was said to have told him that she loved him and supported him, regardless of the paparazzi photograph debacle.Kensington Palace declined, however, to confirm when Miss Markle had last seen her father or when she planned to see him next. They were also unable to say when Prince Harry would meet his new father-in-law. Although the couple have been dating for two years, the prince has only ever spoken to him by phone.Yesterday\u0027s announcement came at the end of a truly remarkable few days, in which Kensington Palace was accused of failing to get a grip of the situation, leaving Thomas Markle to brief the US gossip website TMZ about his plans.  Even Buckingham Palace courtiers have started looking at the website for the latest updates.  But as the final preparations were put into place yesterday afternoon, Miss Markle and Harry appeared to be all smiles. The couple attended their last wedding rehearsal at St George\u0027s Chapel in Windsor with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and their children, Prince George and Princess Charlotte, who are page boy and bridesmaid. Miss Markle looked radiant despite the strain of the past week, wearing a white £285 Boss bodysuit and £7,000 Birks diamond earrings.Although the Queen arrived at Windsor Castle for the weekend while the wedding party was there, she is understood not to have taken part.Friends said last night that despite the drama of the past few days, Miss Markle was excited about the wedding and looking forward to exchanging vows with her prince. One admitted that families could sometimes be \u0027messy\u0027, but that she and Harry knew they had done everything possible to support her parents.\u0027They are just looking forward to the next few days and happy and excited about becoming man and wife,\u0027 the source said.TMZ yesterday said it had again been in touch with Mr Markle.

Meghan Markle imagined here wearing the gown she is rumoured to wear on her wedding day, at the Ralph \u0026amp Russo fashion show at Paris Fashion WeekWill Meghan’s wedding dress impact the bridal industry?Meghan, like Kate Middleton, is likely to choose a dress from a British brand in order to curry favour with the public and in turn, boost the nation’s valuable fashion and bridal industries.Despite the Meghan Markle effect being an industry in itself, being valued at £150 million to the British fashion industry in the form of unofficial brand endorsements, the new Royal’s impact on the bridal industry may be more subtle.After Kate Middleton’s marriage to Prince William, some bridal designers decided to replicate the Sarah Burton for Alexander McQueen dress with hopes that all those who had watched the Royal Wedding would want to purchase a wedding dress similar to hers.According to Lori Conley, Senior Vice President of Product and Design at David’s Bridal, the recreated dress with lace sleeves, plunging neckline and full skirt did not sell. ‘We have internal benchmarks we work with to understand traction of a dress. It feel below those.’While women were inspired by Kate’s look, they did not want to feel as if they were in a costume, so bridal designers are expected to take elements from Meghan’s dress after May 19 and incorporate them in their new collections.However, before the 2011 Royal Wedding, 75 per cent of wedding dresses that David’s Bridal sold were strapless, but after, around 65 percent of brides opted for something with more coverage, from straps to full sleeves.          Kate Middleton seen here on her wedding day with her Maid of Honour and sister Pippa Middleton at Westminster Abbey in LondonIn the same way, Kate’s second wedding dress sparked an interest in sashes, Brides magazine Deputy Digital Director Roberta Correia told Racked that bridal designers are still being influenced by this accessory seven years on.‘Long sleeves, V-necks, and lace have been seen all over the bridal runways since, even at the most recent Bridal Fashion Week. H\u0026ampM released a new dress as part of their wedding collection, which looked almost exactly like Kate’s,’ Roberta said.Although there is high consumer interest in what Meghan wears, trend adoption is slower in the bridal industry, but some brands, like minimalist brand Floravere have already announced that they will have styles inspired by the dress ready within days of the Royal Wedding.Floravere CEO Molly Kang said: ‘As soon as she goes down the aisle, we can see what’s going to explode, whether it’s silhouette, fabric, or neckline.’Royal Wedding dressesWhile Meghan has somewhat disregarded the unspoken Royal dress code when it comes to her day-to-day fashion, she is expected to go for a traditional and classic bridal gown for her big day, similar to what other Royal brides have worn before her.The Queen’s wedding dressQueen Elizabeth II wore a timeless dress designed by the favoured royal couturier Norman Hartnell for her marriage to Lord Philip Mountbatten.The Duchesse ivory silk-creation took three months to complete and had a heart-shaped neckline with a scalloped edge, crystals and a 13 foot patterned train. Like all British brides at the time, the Government gave her 200 extra clothing coupons towards her wedding trousseau.          This picture was taken during the wedding of Princess Elizabeth and the Duke of Edinburgh showing the couple at Buckingham PalacePrincess Margaret’s wedding dress Princess Margaret, the Countess of Snowdon and The Queen’s sister, was seen in a non-traditional dress made from silk organza in what was dubbed the most glamorous wedding of its time, in 1960.During her first marriage to Antony Armstrong-Jones, the Princess wore a modern dress with a skirt comprising of 30 metres of fabric, also designed by Norman Hartnell.Critics claimed it was the simplest wedding gown in history, yet beautiful and sophisticated and can be seen as part of a display at Kensington Palace in London.          Princess Margaret and Anthony Armstrong Jones seen here on the balcony of Buckingham Palace on their wedding day with one of the Princess\u0027s bridesmaidsPrincess Diana’s wedding dressAt the time, Lady Diana Spencer’s wedding dress was known as the ‘most closely guarded secret in fashion history’.Designed by David and Elizabeth Emanuel, the meringue style gown was worth £9,000 in 1981 and is now valued at approximately £36,800.For her wedding to Prince Charles, Diana’s dress was made of ivory silk taffeta and antique lace with what has now become an iconic 25 foot train.

They all look beautiful.\u0027          Vicky, 33, smiles with her bridesmaids and holds her daughter ahead of walking down the aisleThe young couple had visiting a plethora of venues across the country, and even dabbling with the idea of going to Ibiza or Las Vegas, before settling on having a \u0027quiet\u0027 wedding closer to their home in the village of Datchet, Berkshire.  But the loved-up couple\u0027s choice to exchange their vows under The Queen\u0027s brass chandeliers won\u0027t be the only connections to the Royal Family that day.Speaking before their wedding 33-year- old Vicky, said: \u0027We\u0027re getting married the day before, thank God.          Crowds of well-wishers anticipating the Royal Wedding stand behind barriers as the bride makes her way from her hotel to Windsor Guildhall\u0027That wouldn\u0027t have been good if we were. I\u0027d want to cancel it if I was getting married on the same day.\u0027It was a relief it wasn\u0027t on the same day. Because we were on tenterhooks really. They announced they were getting married, and then I thought \u0027oh don\u0027t worry they\u0027re going to be in London or something like that\u0027. And then it came up on the news that they announced the location. Then it was spring. Then it was May. And I was like, no. C\u0027mon.\u0027Then we waited for a couple of weeks then they announced the date. It came up breaking news on my phone and I was like, \u0027oh my God, look\u0027. So, phew. We just took it as it was.           Hairdresser Vicky, 33, holds her daughter\u0027s hand and a bouquet of pink and white flowers as she walks through Windsor\u0027The reason we booked there was because we thought it would be nice and quiet. It was convenient. Aron doesn\u0027t like all the attention as it is.\u0027So now it\u0027s just the complete opposite for us. I\u0027m really excited and I\u0027m loving it.\u0027Hairstylist Vicky, her mother and daughter were booked into the Hart and Garter directly opposite Windsor Castle which has view that peaks into the Lower Ward next to St George\u0027s Chapel where Prince Harry and Meghan with say their vows.          Vicky stayed directly opposite Windsor Castle the night before her big day. She then made a procession across the townDespite being booked for months the hotel emailed them and cancelled the booking as the rooms had all been let to foreign media outlets for the royal nuptials.Aron said: \u0027It was saying you\u0027re not staying in the room anymore. The broadcasters book it at the beginning of each year in case of an event like this so we couldn\u0027t have the room. But obviously they didn\u0027t know at the time it was for a wedding. After lengthy negotiations we\u0027ve still got a room there.\u0027  Devastated the bride-to-be did not give up and negotiated with the hotel until another room was found.\u0027Then I was worried about how all the flowers and bits and pieces were going to get to us at the hotel.          Onlookers lean over barrier to get a glance of the blushing bride who has been saving for three years to pay for the £10,000 wedding\u0027And I have to worry about now is negotiating the walk from the hotel to the Guildhall on the morning in my wedding dress as there will be lots of people and security.\u0027I did think about cancelling it entirely but the town is going to look beautiful and it will be very special.\u0027That\u0027s not where the similarities end though, as Vicky, just like Meghan, won\u0027t have her father walk her down the aisle.And they too will be paying for their own wedding, after three years of saving up £10,000 for their special day.          Vicky, like Meghan, was not accompanied down the aisle by her father. She considered Ibiza to get married before choosing Windsor, near her home\u0027We are really indecisive. So when we got engaged it took us three years because we actually looked at a lot of places. I even put a deposit down on somewhere and we lost the deposit\u0027.\u0027We all went to Ibiza and looked at venue there. That was lovely. We loved that. But then I thought my grandparents wouldn\u0027t be able to make it. And we looked at Vegas. But for the children and the kids to go there it\u0027s not really practical and that was just adding up too much.\u0027So we have had a look at a lot of places. We went to so many hotels. We went to Liverpool because Aron\u0027s a massive Liverpool fan.\u0027It\u0027s been fun and now this. We thought, actually let\u0027s do it nice and close. Nice and quiet and do it in the school holidays, and now this has happened. Pretty surreal isn\u0027t it.\u0027          Vicky says she was really happy for Harry and liked Meghan Markle - and didn\u0027t feel upstaged by the royal nupitalsHair stylist Vicky and self-employed electrician Aron\u0027s big day will be a lot more low key than Prince Harry and Meghan\u0027s with a total of 70 guests, not that the soon-to-be newlyweds begrudge that.\u0027I wouldn\u0027t say I feel angry about it,\u0027 said the mother-of-two.\u0027I mean it was stressful. It\u0027s amazing for them that he\u0027s found someone. I don\u0027t hold any grudges. It\u0027s nice that he\u0027s found love. And it\u0027s lovely he\u0027s getting married a day after me in Windsor. \u0027I\u0027ve always liked him because he\u0027s a bit out there.. He\u0027s the bad one. He\u0027s the one who has fun by the looks of it. Obviously I don\u0027t know a lot about her, but I speak to a lot of people as I\u0027m a hairdresser. It all seems very positive about her.\u0027The only thing I thought was they\u0027ve been together five minutes and it\u0027s took me this long to get my day and now this is happening. That\u0027s the only way I can say I feel about it. But they may have been together longer than we know. But we\u0027ve got a nice story. And it\u0027s a nice joyous lovely story. So that\u0027s what\u0027s nice that\u0027s come out of this.\u0027And the Royals they are nice people. The Royals are good people. It\u0027s nice to have a connection in that way.\u0027          Vicky wore a floor length ivory dress and lace veil to her wedding. Her bridesmaids wore silver dresses and the groom a blue suitAnd while it\u0027s suggested Prince Harry and Meghan will be enjoying the exotic locations such as Barbados or Botswana for their honeymoon, Vicky and Aron will instead jet off to Mellieha in Malta, along with their two children, Elliot, 10, and Sienna, 7.  So are the couple worried their most important day of their lives might get overshadowed?\u0027No, because everyone is going to be able to make it,\u0027 says Vicky.\u0027I\u0027m very chilled and relaxed about it.\u0027It was 15 years ago the pair met at Uxbridge high street pub The Good Yarn when Vicky \u0027heckled\u0027 at Aron after his phone went off \u0027like in Trigger Happy TV\u0027.          Police and photographers flanked the bride as she made her way down to the Windsor Guildhall \u0027He came in and his phone went off and I was like giving it some,\u0027 said Vicky.\u0027We were just having a bit of banter probably just taking the mickey.\u0027 \u0027And I thought I could probably get her number, so I did,\u0027 he tells me with a wry smile.\u0027We were young,\u0027 explains Vicky. \u0027I was 18, just turning 19. And he had just turned 20 and I thought he was really old. It developed from there.\u0027Twelve years later, Aron thought it was the perfect time to \u0027stumble over\u0027 and get down on one knee to pop the question at The Grand Hotel in Brighton.Vicky said: \u0027I obviously wanted to get married for a long time but actually it\u0027s quite nice at the age we are.\u0027After all that time. We went back to the hotel as we were going out that evening and he just popped it out then. He doesn\u0027t like any audiences or anything like that as he gets quite shy. They say opposites attract.\u0027It was nice and quiet and intimate and of course I was going to say yes. There was nothing to be worried about.\u0027 Another happy couple also tied the knot at Windsor Guildhall today.     Karen Lewis and Reggie Palmer also booked the Guildhall for their wedding before the announcement of the Royal Wedding. The couple, from Horton in Slough, posed for pictures outside the venue.

So, that\u0027s something to remember.\u0027I\u0027m sad. I think he was very good for Arsenal for maybe 12 to 15 years but he couldn\u0027t bring himself to organise our defence properly.

Amazing. I\u0027m more overwhelmed than I expected.\u0027There\u0027s such sincerity in (Prince of Wales\u0027s) eyes, he seems to do everyone with the same amounts of pride.

Both he and the Duchess (of Cornwall) have been encouraging for a number of years now.\u0027To channel the weight of heritage with the simple human easiness that he particularly demonstrates is an extraordinary feat and one of the reasons, as heads of state go, we\u0027ve got the best in the business.\u0027"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/18/15/4C660FE400000578-0-image-m-70_1526652079593.jpg","title":"Archbishop Canterbury praises Meghan Markle officiates wedding","story":"     The Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby (left) is pictured with American bishop Michael Curry (right) at St George\u0027s Chapel in Windsor today, ahead of the royal wedding tomorrowAsked about what he thinks of the Prince of Wales being chosen to walk Meghan Markle down the aisle, the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, said Charles is \u0027someone of great care and affection\u0027.He added: \u0027He\u0027s a very warm person and that he\u0027s doing this is a sign of his love and concern and support.

There\u0027s not very many Meghans with a \u0027H\u0027 around.\u0027Little Meghan said of her namesake: \u0027I think she\u0027s very nice.\u0027 As Harry was returning to the castle, he spotted a friend in the crowd who has made it home from a big cycling trip just in time for the wedding.Dean Stott, 41, travelled the 14,000-mile Pan American Highway in 99 days, 12 hours and 56 minutes, knocking an astonishing 17 days off the previous best. The former special forces soldier trained with the prince for six weeks in 2007 and the pair have stayed close, with the groom-to-be finding time to congratulate his guest on the record-breaking achievement.Afterwards Mr Stott said it was the first time he and Harry had seen each other since he returned, adding that he had not quite realised the magnitude of the wedding. Mr Stott said he was \u0027honoured and privileged\u0027 to be attending the wedding.   Accompanied by his older brother, Harry was met with loud cheers from the crowd as he emerged from the castle wearing a grey jacket, white shirt and slacks          \u0027I just want to go to the pub!\u0027: Harry pointed at the Horse and Groom pub behind adoring fans and photographers in Windsor this evening           Harry and Meghan are pictured among a crowd of well-wishers in the groom\u0027s final public appearance as a single man          Harry holds a teddy bear with a red jumper as he and Prince William greet crowds outside Windsor Castle this evening  Prince Harry walks around in front of Windsor Castle as he greeted well-wishers on his last evening of bachelorhoodAt tomorrow\u0027s service the bride  will walk through the Nave and Prince Charles will be waiting  at the start of the Quire - half way down the chapel - to take her to the altar.A source told MailOnline: \u0027It was something that she made clear she wanted to do when she and Prince Harry started planning their wedding last November\u0027.Many royal fans appear delighted at Meghan\u0027s decision because Charles does not have a daughter - but some critics believe the star, 36, should have plumped for Doria.The dramatic twist came as Prince Philip, 96, confirmed he will be well enough to attend the ceremony after successfully recovering from a hip operation last month. Harry\u0027s father is vastly more experienced than Doria at appearing at large-scale public events amid intense scrutiny. He also performed the duty for Alexandra Knatchbull, the daughter of his close friend, Lord Brabourne, in 2016. Meghan\u0027s father Thomas Markle was forced to pull out of performing the fatherly duty after undergoing heart surgery in a dramatic upset just two days before the wedding.             One member of the adoring crowd gave Harry what is possibly his and Meghan\u0027s first wedding present - a fluffy teddy bear    Outside the Horse and Groom pub, Harry shook hands with fans and spoke to children in the crowd while well-wishers filmed his every move on their mobile phones           Prince Harry is given the teddy bear by one of his well-wishers outside Windsor Castle this eveningIn a statement, Kensington Palace said: \u0027Ms Meghan Markle has asked His Royal Highness The Prince of Wales to accompany her down the aisle of the Quire of St George\u0027s Chapel on her Wedding Day.\u0027The Prince of Wales is pleased to be able to welcome Ms Markle to The Royal Family in this way.\u0027Until today Prince Charles was the second favourite at 31 yesterday to walk Meghan down the aisle, with her mother Doria Ragland the favourite at 13. Third favourite was Prince William at 51. Her half-brother, Thomas Markle Jr., was pictured outside Windsor Castle this week after flying to the UK ahead of the service.  The royal bride will hope there are no further surprises from her family to disrupt the build-up to the wedding. Ms Ragland has already enjoyed a \u0027jolly\u0027 meeting with Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall, just hours after landing, and yesterday met the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and their children.           Harry, looking relaxed wearing an open-necked white shirt and light jacket, waved to the crowds and chatted to his brother before making a beeline to talk to a young girl waiting among the crowds outside          Fans carrying royal wedding memorabilia were out in force tonight as they poured into Windsor to wish Prince Harry well before he ties the knot with Meghan tomorrow            The prince gives photographers and members of the public a thumbs up as he chats and jokes with people who gathered in Windsor tonight           Royal fans use their phones to take pictures of a smiling Prince Harry as he appeared outside Windsor Castle this evening    These ladies managed to secure a perfect vantage spot for seeing Prince Harry greet the public for the final time as a bachelor  Prince Harry and Meghan Markle looked relaxed as their Range Rover took them to Windsor Castle today with just a day to go until they marry  The couple waved and chatted in the back of their Range Rover while arriving at Windsor around an hour later (pictured)          Meghan looked happy and relaxed despite a tumultuous few days caused by her father\u0027s paparazzi deal and poor health          Meghan asked Prince Charles to give her away after her father dropped out at the last minute and the heir to the throne was seen entering the Windsor Castle estate todayThe surprise walkabout by the brothers echoed the eve of William\u0027s own wedding in 2011 when the pair greeted royal fans with an impromptu public appearance on The Mall in central London          Prince Harry waves and holds the teddy bear he was given by one of the well-wishers as spectators take their own pictures          Harry and William surprised royal well-wishers with a walkabout outside Windsor Castle the night before the wedding          Prince Harry smiles broadly with Windsor Castle and crowds of well-wishers in the background the night before his wedding  Prince Harry waves and gives a thumbs-up to members of the public as he steps outside Windsor Castle this evening          Harry smiles as he greets some of the thousands of royal enthusiasts who have descended on Windsor for the ceremony          William smiles as his brother Harry shows him the teddy bear which he was given as a gift by one of the crowd of royal fans          Prince William meets members of the public who have gathered outside Windsor Castle ahead of the royal wedding          Prince Harry and Prince William meet the public during a pre-wedding walkabout, outside the Horse and Groom pub          Prince Harry gives royal fans a thumbs-up as some of the people waiting outside Windsor Castle take pictures of the groom          Harry smiles for one royal spectator\u0027s camera as he goes for a walk outside Windsor Castle with his best man William          Prince Harry reaches into the crowd to greet well-wishers outside Windsor Castle hours before the royal wedding          The Duke of Edinburgh is to attend the royal wedding to see his grandson Prince Harry marry Meghan Markle, Buckingham Palace has said.Philip, 96, has been recovering after undergoing a hip operation.The Duke was spotted at the Royal Windsor Horse Show last week - the first public sighting of the Queen\u0027s consort since he left hospital last month. The Duke was taken to the private King Edward VII hospital in central London on April 3, for surgery to replace his joint with a prosthetic implant.He underwent the planned procedure the following day and left hospital on April 13.The duke, who retired from royal duties in August 2017, has since continued his recovery in Windsor.His appearance at tomorrow\u0027s wedding will please the royal fans, with whom he is extremely poplar.                                                     Last night royal fans were seen camping out outside the castle to ensure a good view of the planned procession, using sleeping bags and even folding chairs after local police banned tents. Yesterday they witnessed a full rehearsal in which a carriage and members of the armed forces paraded through the streets of Windsor. Meghan has pleaded for her 73-year-old father, who is recovering from heart surgery in Mexico after revelations about his alleged collusion with a paparazzi photographer, to be given \u0027space\u0027. In the statement, which she is said to have written herself, Miss Markle, 36, said: \u0027Sadly, my father will not be attending our wedding.\u0027I have always cared for my father and hope he can be given the space he needs to focus on his health.\u0027I would like to thank everyone who has offered generous messages of support. Please know how much Harry and I look forward to sharing our special day with you on Saturday.\u0027 Amid criticism from some in the extended Markle family, sources close to Miss Markle yesterday insisted that she and Harry, 33, had offered both her parents substantial \u0027support and advice\u0027 as to how to handle the global interest since they started dating in 2016.And friends told the Mail that contrary to claims by her half-siblings, Samantha Markle and Thomas Markle Jnr, that she had left their intensely private father to deal with the paparazzi on his own, she had been in \u0027frequent\u0027 touch with him by phone and text, including in recent days.It is understood Mr Markle told his daughter personally that he would not be medically fit enough to fly to the UK.  It was claimed yesterday that he was recovering after having three stents implanted in arteries following a heart attack at home in Mexico eight days ago, and that he had said it would \u0027take a long time to heal\u0027.In return, Miss Markle was said to have told him that she loved him and supported him, regardless of the paparazzi photograph debacle.            A man puts a flag up above a shop featuring Harry and Meghan decorations in Windsor ahead of the royal wedding           People with Canadian flags camp out in Windsor ahead of the wedding of Harry and Meghan tomorrow          A group of royal wedding enthusiasts hold up flags and Harry and Meghan memorabilia outside Windsor Castle  The Royal Standard flies over Windsor Castle showing the Queen is in residence with the tow below a sea of Union Flag bunting today          In the town huge crowds of people have gathered on the eve of Meghan and Harry\u0027s wedding in the grounds of the castlePolice, the Army and the security services are forming a £30million ring of steel to protect the couple and the 100,000 people expected to visit the Berkshire town - but some armed officers took the time to pose with some Meghan fans  Royal fans from Britain, America and around the world are gathering outside Windsor Castle in huge numbers today with many wearing flags, costumes and hats          Sniffer dogs protect the huge numbers in Windsor today as part of the biggest security operation of recent times          One lucky bride, Vicky Compson, got to feel what it was like to be a princess for the day when she walked through the route Meghan and Harry will follow  to her own wedding today          Newlyweds Vicky and Aron Hallam then smiled after sharing a kiss during their reception at the Prince Harry pub in Windsor           Isabelle Sherlock and Charlie Twitchett, both ten, play Meghan Markle and Prince Harry for the day as they leave Fleetwood Methodist Church in Lancashire as  hundreds of primary school children staged their own version of the royal wedding today  Will Shepherd and Sienna Harrison, four-year-old cousins, played Harry and Meghan for the day at a nursery in Orrell, Wigan          School children wave flags on the Long Walk ahead of the wedding of the year tomorrow    Meghan and Harry will spend the evening apart this evening and the next time they will see each other again will be at the altar           Charles and Camilla were pictured leaving Kensington Palace by helicopter yesterday and this may have been when Meghan asked her future father-in-law if he would step in  This is how Meghan\u0027s entrance to St George\u0027s Chapel will unfold tomorrow and how Charles will meet her halfway          Kensington Palace has said that the Prince of Wales will accompany her down the aisle of the Quire of St George\u0027s Chapel (pictured          Prince Charles said today he was \u0027pleased to welcome her to the royal family in this way\u0027, Kensington Palace revealed in a shock statement that also suggested Meghan could enter the church alone and meet Charles half way          Charles is said to be very fond of Meghan (pictured together on Christmas Day at Sandringham) and was happy to help her after her father caused a crisis ahead of her wedding            Royal fans have mostly reacted positively to the news, speaking of their joy for Prince Charles, but others have also said Meghan should have asked her mother Doria Meghan\u0027s mother Doria (pictured left in LA) was expected to give her daughter away.

They were also unable to say when Prince Harry would meet his new father-in-law. Although the couple have been dating for two years, the prince has only ever spoken to him by phone.Yesterday\u0027s announcement came at the end of a truly remarkable few days, in which Kensington Palace was accused of failing to get a grip of the situation, leaving Thomas Markle to brief the US gossip website TMZ about his plans.  Even Buckingham Palace courtiers have started looking at the website for the latest updates.  But as the final preparations were put into place yesterday afternoon, Miss Markle and Harry appeared to be all smiles.The couple attended their last wedding rehearsal at St George\u0027s Chapel in Windsor with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and their children, Prince George and Princess Charlotte, who are page boy and bridesmaid. Miss Markle looked radiant despite the strain of the past week, wearing a white £285 Boss bodysuit and £7,000 Birks diamond earrings.Although the Queen arrived at Windsor Castle for the weekend while the wedding party was there, she is understood not to have taken part.Friends said last night that despite the drama of the past few days, Miss Markle was excited about the wedding and looking forward to exchanging vows with her prince. One admitted that families could sometimes be \u0027messy\u0027, but that she and Harry knew they had done everything possible to support her parents.\u0027They are just looking forward to the next few days and happy and excited about becoming man and wife,\u0027 the source said.  The Prince of Wales is at Buckingham Palace today where he made author and broadcaster Melvyn Bragg,  a Companion of Honour as news emerged he will give Meghan away          Charlies gave away Alexandra Knatchbull, the daughter of his close friend, Lord Brabourne, in 2016.

A police boat cruises the Thames in Windsor today as part of the £30m operation to keep the event secure            Sniffer dogs are checking the streets while police are checking drains and removing bins to stop any attack on the royal wedding          The Quire in St George\u0027s Chapel at Windsor Castle, where Prince Charles will walk Meghan Markle down the aisle tomorrowThe prince and Ms Markle\u0027s reception will be held in the castle\u0027s 180ft (55m) long St George\u0027s Hall, traditionally used for glittering state banquets.The vast hall had to be restored following the devastating fire at the castle in 1992.The chapel, with its intricately carved stonework, magnificent fan vaulted ceiling and beautiful stained glass windows, has seen many royal weddings and funerals.The last royal wedding was for Harry\u0027s cousin, Peter Phillips, son of the Princess Royal, who married Canadian Autumn Kelly in 2008.Harry\u0027s father and stepmother, the Duchess of Cornwall, had their televised religious blessing there in 2005, after their civil ceremony down the road in Windsor\u0027s Town Hall.In 1999, Harry\u0027s uncle, the Earl of Wessex, married Sophie Rhys-Jones, now the Countess of Wessex, at St George\u0027s.Royal newlyweds and their families traditionally pose for photographs afterwards on the vast west steps, as Harry and his new bride are certain to do.It has been the setting for many historic funerals including the Queen Mother\u0027s private committal service following her Westminster Abbey funeral in 2002, and in the same year, Princess Margaret\u0027s small, private funeral.The funeral of the Queen\u0027s father, King George VI, took place at St George\u0027s in 1952.Like Westminster Abbey, the chapel is known as a Royal Peculiar, with the Dean of Windsor responsible only to the sovereign.The church, a place of worship for the Queen and her family, is often at the heart of royal events, with the Windsors gathering there each year for Easter services, and in the past for occasions such as the service to mark the Duke of Edinburgh\u0027s 90th birthday.Within the chapel are the tombs of 10 sovereigns - as well as George VI, the remains of Edward IV, Henry VI, Henry VIII and his third wife Jane Seymour, the beheaded Charles I, George III, George IV, William IV, Edward VII and George V also rest there.                           \u0027Prince Charles doesn\u0027t have a daughter so he must be VERY happy\u0027: Social media overflows with praise for Meghan\u0027s \u0027touching\u0027 decision to ask her father-in-law to give her away... although feminists claim the decision is \u0027sexist\u0027Royal fans today spoke of their joy for Prince Charles after it was revealed he will step in for the father of the bride and walk Meghan Markle down the aisle.The Prince of Wales will give his soon-to-be daughter-in-law away when she marries Prince Harry tomorrow at St George\u0027s Chapel in Windsor Castle.Meghan, 36, asked her future father-in-law to accompany her on the way to the altar after her father Thomas Markle had to pull out following heart surgery.Responding to the announcement by Kensington Palace this morning, royal fans praised the \u0027fantastic\u0027 decision and said they were delighted for Charles.             Royal fans have mostly reacted positively to the news, speaking of their joy for Prince CharlesOne said: \u0027What a lovely thing. Charles himself has no biological daughters but he will definitely be gaining one tomorrow. It will be a very touching moment.\u0027Another from New South Wales, Australia, tweeted: \u0027What a wonderful blessing for them both. Something Charles thought he would never be able to do.\u0027Her mother may not have been comfortable doing this. Whatever the reason, it is fantastic. Many blessings and prayers for both Harry and Meghan.\u0027And a third said: \u0027I knew it would be Prince Charles. I was hoping for her mum to do it, but I guess she wanted to keep things as traditional as possible. Great choice!\u0027However, not everyone was happy with the announcement. Aimee Day tweeted: \u0027No, it should have been her mum to do it. She brought her up and she should do it.             Others are not so impressed by the decision, with some claiming it is a \u0027sexist\u0027 move\u0027In general I think the mother\u0027s should do it anyway. After all, in most situations the mother does everything for their child over the father - in my experience.\u0027And Rachel Douce added: \u0027Disappointing that Prince Charles is walking Meghan down the aisle. Perfect opportunity for the royals to show how modern and not sexist they are and let Doria do it, but no.\u0027Mr Markle was forced to pull out of performing the fatherly duty after undergoing heart surgery in a dramatic upset just two days before the wedding.The actress\u0027s mother Doria Ragland had been tipped to perform the role. But Harry\u0027s father is far more experienced at appearing at big public events amid scrutiny.Wedding-watchers camped outside Windsor Castle in readiness for the festivities said they felt her soon-to-be father-in-law stepping in was a \u0027nice gesture\u0027.The announcement from Kensington Palace on Friday morning came with just 24 hours to go until the big day, with final preparations well under way in Windsor. Windsor visitor Leslie Haynes, from Washington, said: \u0027I was surprised actually. I knew that Prince Charles was in the running. I just assumed it would be her mother.\u0027But it was Meghan\u0027s approval and choice and so we support that, and, as we say, the next King of England is going to walk her down the aisle.\u0027The 58-year-old, who is camping  opposite the castle, said she was \u0027somewhat\u0027 disappointed that Miss Ragland would not accompany Meghan to the altar.She added: \u0027But I have to say that it\u0027s her choice so we\u0027re happy for her. She is going to be the happiest woman in the world tomorrow so how could we be disappointed about that?\u0027Margaret Phipps, 25, from Texas, said: \u0027She has such a close relationship with her mum, so I think it is surprising to some people. But I think it\u0027s a nice gesture. \u0027He (Charles) doesn\u0027t have a daughter that he\u0027d ever be able to walk down the aisle. And it just sort of shows her transition into the royal family.\u0027She\u0027s really becoming a part of that family with him kind of acting as the father figure in situations, so I personally think it\u0027s nice.\u0027Sylvia Horn, 61, from Nashville, said it is \u0027wonderful\u0027, adding: \u0027It\u0027s usually a gentleman that does it.\u0027 \u0027I fully approve since Charles is going to be her father-in-law,\u0027 she said.  "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/18/00/4C61342200000578-0-image-m-21_1526601358781.jpg","title":"Kate Osamor caught plagiarising Barack Obamas acceptance speech","story":"Kate Osamor (pictured right) used a chunk of Barack Obama\u0027s speech to hail her own reelection to Edmonton in last year\u0027s election Ex Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith accuses EU of trying to...Share this articleShe said: \u0027If there is anyone out there who doubts that Edmonton is a place where all things are possible, who still wonders if the dream of hope is alive in our time, who still questions the power of our democracy, tonight is your answer.\u0027It\u0027s the answer told by the lines of people stretched around polling stations, schools and churches. \u0027By young people who queued, many for the first time in their lives because they believed that voting for Labour this time must be different, that their voices could be the difference.\u0027 The section is virtually identical to Mr Obama\u0027s speech in his hometown of Chicago after he was elected President for the first time.He told the crowd: \u0027If there is anyone out there who still doubts that America is a place where all things are possible, who still wonders if the dream of our founders is alive in our time, who still questions the power of our democracy, tonight is your answer.

You won’t see a lot of skin. At least you shouldn’t. It would be seen as disrespectful,’ Meier said. She continued to explain that dresses in black or white should not be worn, as white is for the bride and black is still associated with mourning.While light prints and patterns are welcome at a Spring wedding, big and block patterns are unacceptable but international guests will be permitted to wear their country’s equivalent.          Spain\u0027s Prince Felipe seen here flanked by Princess Letizia and Spain\u0027s Queen Sofia, outside of Westminster Abbey ahead of the wedding between Prince William and Kate MiddletonAccording to etiquette experts Debrett’s, Meghan Markle’s boundary-pushing style will allow for some leeway when it comes to traditional Royal Wedding protocol.It may be unusual to see women wearing trousers at a wedding, but Meghan’s own decision to wear a pantsuit at formal events may mean that covered legs could be welcomed on the big day, especially after jumpsuits were approved at Royal Ascot’s Royal Enclosure.Many invitees may also take a page out of Kate’s book and choose a piece by British labels such as Stella McCartney, Burberry, Emilia Wickstead, Erdem or even Marks and Spencer, as Meghan Markle has in the past.Will Royal Wedding guests be required to wear hats?Women often start with the hat when planning their outfits, as Meier explained and they are kept on during a wedding church service. ‘Hats are a sign of festivity for a British wedding. They are kept on inside the church, but people should be careful of the people sitting behind them. It\u0027s not the Kentucky Derby. No huge brims. Nothing too high.’Princess Beatrice’s hat at Prince William’s wedding was regarded ‘ridiculous in so many ways’ by Royal watcher Anne Chertoff.          Princess Beatrice seen here wearing the Philip Treacy hat she wore at the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge in 2011When it comes to shoes, open toes, wedges and slingbacks are too informal. Meier said: ‘You want something that is about 4 inches maximum. \u0027The walk in is not going to be easy. There are lots of cobblestones even though there will be different types of carpeting.’In addition to this, handbags should be small as the seating in St. George’s Chapel is very tight, so clutches are recommended.What will men wear to the Royal Wedding?Those who have a military uniform are encouraged to wear it, but most men will opt for a morning suit in either grey, navy or black with coattails. Men will also be expected to wear a waistcoat and a regular tie.For lounge suits, the rule of thumb is the darker it is, the more formal it will look and that rules goes for morning suits too. In the same way, brown shoes are considered less formal than black ones.          Prince William and his wife Kate, Duchess of Cambridge, seen here coming out of Westminster Abbey in London, after their wedding service in 2011What will Meghan Markle wear?Despite the Royal Wedding dress designer being a closely-guarded secret, rumours have suggested that Ralph \u0026amp Russo is the British couturer that has been picked by Meghan Markle. The dress is expected to be a hand-stitched and heavily beaded gown with long sleeves.What will Prince Harry wear?Prince Harry will most likely wear his Household Cavalry British Army uniform and it has been rumoured that he will have to shave his beard because facial hair is frowned upon by the military circle, according to Elle.However, Harry may also go for a morning suit because the wedding is a much more low key affair than that of his brother, Prince William’s. Other rumours suggest that he will wear the Royal Marines ceremonial uniform as a mark of respect to the regiment he took over from Prince Philip.The French Open 2018: Roland Garros dates, schedule and tickets revealedBachelorette 2018: Chris Harrison reveals premiere will have \u0027most ridiculous fight ever\u0027Who was Stephanie Adams?

Her father was a struggling department-store buyer. Wildenstein moved to Paris when she was a teenager.During that time she was in a relationship with the filmmaker Sergio Gobbi. Before her marriage to Alec, she was also linked to Saudi arms dealer Adnan Khashoggi and Cyril Piguet.In 1977, at the age of 31, Wildenstein met Alec on a safari trip to Kenya. Alec was there to kill a lion and Wildenstein asked to accompany him. The pair eloped the following year in Las Vegas.It was a tempestuous marriage. The couple reportedly spent $1 million a month on average and went for his-and-hers eye-lifts a year into their marriage. This marked the beginning of a long list of plastic surgeries.‘I would always find out last. She was thinking that she could fix her face like a piece of furniture. Skin does not work that way. But she wouldn’t listen,’ Alec Wildenstein told Vanity Fair.\u0027I don’t think I’ve known her when she wasn’t healing from something,\u0027 said a friend of Jocelyn in 1998. Wildenstein has frequently denied she’s had work done, saying in 1998 that her looks, which led to her being branded ‘Catwoman’, were natural.          In February 2018, the 77-year-old socialite said that she hasn\u0027t had any plastic surgery done‘If I show you pictures of my grandmother,’ she says, ‘what you see is these eyes—cat eyes—and high cheekbones.’ Wildenstein went on to deny she ever had any work done on her nose.After the couple’s children left home, Alec and Wildenstein ended up having ‘constant’ fights.One night, Wildenstein says she walked in on her husband with another woman and alleges he pointed a gun at her and her bodyguards—something Alec disputed, saying Wildenstein was downstairs when he saw the bodyguards.Alec spent the night in jail after the police were called.The pair’s orce was highly public and messy, with Alec slowly cutting Wildenstein’s financial means.Jocelyn Wildenstein before and after plastic surgeryJocelyn Wildenstein reportedly had her first plastic surgery a year after marrying her husband, in 1978. The pair went in for eye-lifts and the surgery was reportedly the first of many.However, in February 2018, Wildenstein and her now second husband, Lloyd Klein both denied she had any work done.\u0027I don\u0027t understand the whole press and the Catwoman thing because Jocelyn always looked like that,\u0027 Klein told DailyMailTV.Jocelyn Wildenstein reportedly had her first plastic surgery, an eye-lift, with Alec in 1978\u0027She never really did anything to change her face. I have pictures from 16 years old where she looks exactly the same as today.\u0027 However, in April 2018, Wildenstein admitted to having surgeries but stopping for a time during her orce from Alec.\u0027In the beginning, it\u0027s why I stopped correcting my appearance because the articles were mean and would repeat the image that my ex-husband tried to paint of me,\u0027 she told Paper Magazine. What is Jocelyn Wildenstein’s net worth?Jocelyn Wildenstein’s net worth is $16,386,100, according to her Chapter 11 bankruptcy documentation.This is a far cry from the $2.5 billion she was awarded during her orce from Alec Wildenstein. The filing lists that the socialite receives a $900 check a month from Social Security, which it says is her only source of income.Jocelyn Wildenstein bankruptcyJocelyn Wildenstein filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in May 2018, reportedly owing 16 creditors over $6 million. This includes hundreds of thousands of dollars to several building contractors, $70,000 to American Express, over $200,000 to two law firms, and $179,000 to Trump world Tower Condominium.Wildenstein also owes a staggering $4.6 million to Castellan Capital and $700,000 to a New York storage company.The French Open 2018: Roland Garros dates, schedule and tickets revealedBachelorette 2018: Chris Harrison reveals premiere will have \u0027most ridiculous fight ever\u0027Who was Stephanie Adams?

Evans is circled, standing fourth from the left with his teammates in 1931, including Hall of Famers Josh Gibson (standing fourth from right) and Oscar Charleston (standing second from right)          Author and historian Phil Dixon writes about Evans\u0027 talent in his book, American Baseball Chronicles: The Great Teams, the 1931 Grays. Dixon says that Evans, a Kentucky native, scored over 70 runsIt may be Markle\u0027s link to athletic success which is most surprising, however - and one which highlights the struggle of her African-American ancestors against racism and segregation.Evans was part of a team which at the time was hailed for its dominance. In a 1936 Pittsburgh Courier article the write said he \u0027considers the 1931 Homestead Grays the strongest club the Grays ever assembled and the strongest club of modern Negro baseball as far back as we can remember\u0027.It also said: \u0027Much of the credit due this club of 1931 can be given to Bill Evans and George Britt. Evans filled in at short-stop for three months and took part in all the important series.\u0027Online bloggers have also debated whether the 1931 Grays were the top Negro League team of all time.Their existence as a team came as part of the Great Migration, the movement of African-Americans from the poor south to the booming industrial north - among them Homestead, a steel town just outside Pittsburgh. In 1910 black mill workers created the Homestead Grays as a recreational activity, according to website Baseball Almanac the team \u0027would eventually thrill baseball fans for years\u0027.The Almanac writes that under the leadership of owner Cumberland Posey the team were \u0027known as barnstormers who would play ball in hundreds of small towns, usually taking on and beating the best local baseball talent available, white or black\u0027. Historian Phil Dixon, the author of American Baseball Chronicles: The Great Teams, the 1931 Grays - was able to give a detailed account of Evans\u0027 achievements at the Grays - a team he described \u0027the greatest all around baseball team ever assembled\u0027.He said: \u0027In 1931 Evans scored over seventy runs and surpassed 125 hits while banging 18 doubles, 5 triples and a pair of home runs - numbers he collected while serving in the dual capacity as an outfielderinfielder.\u0027He could be considered a utility player, both of those positions required you to throw very well. The thing is Evans had to be a great ball player to even get on that team. There was not a weak link on that team.\u0027Speaking about the team\u0027s incredible record, the writer said: \u0027From a winning stand point they won more games, lost fewer games than anyone.          Satchel Paige is the only 1931 Grays player who made it into the Major League. The pitcher, who threw a few games for the Grays in 1931, entered the MLB in 1948, aged 42, a year after Jackie Robinson ended segregation. He first played for the Cleveland Indians\u0027They scored over 1600 runs, they had four pitchers who won 20 games, they had five guys that hit over 20 home runs. It goes on and on, everything this team did was big.\u0027That Homestead Grays team was in my estimation the greatest all around baseball team ever assembled period, that includes Major League and everything. That team, their record was they won 143 games and they lost 29.\u0027The New York Yankees didn\u0027t score 1,000 runs until 1938 but this team scored 1600 runs. They were outstanding. They had a tremendous team.\u0027I think if I\u0027m correct the team has about six Hall of Famers that are in the Hall of Fame in Cooperstown today from that team, with Babe Ruth and all the rest of them.\u0027Despite the team\u0027s talents, however, the players never got to compete in the major leagues because of the color of their skin.Dixon said: \u0027They had everything going for them, but the only thing they couldn\u0027t get past was racism. At that time, they couldn\u0027t even get into the major leagues because of segregation.\u0027Segregation, not only did it affect where they played, but it also affected their livelihood, how much they were paid, endorsements, they didn\u0027t get any endorsements, and basically when you finished playing ball you had to get whatever job you could get.\u0027Many of these guys who were just tremendous ball players never got paid, so they went into other things, and some of them were pretty good at these other things they went into. But they never got the money.\u0027People call baseball the national pastime and I tell people that America\u0027s other national pastime was racism.\u0027Comparing what the Negro league players earned to 1930s major league star Dizzy Dean, Dixon explained: \u0027Take Dizzy Dean a great player in the Hall of Fame, Dean was making $7,500 and he made three times that much in endorsements so he might have been around $40-50,000 a year and these guys playing in the negro leagues they were lucky if they were getting $400 a month.\u0027It was a huge disparity, and you weren\u0027t going to get any endorsements for anything, Dizzy Dean was advertising clothing, hats, toys, greeting cards, he was being paid for going on the radio, they got all of that and these black guys got none of it.\u0027Bill Evans played for several Negro baseball teams in different Negro baseball leagues.He began playing amateur and collegiate baseball with the Louisville White Sox and Livingston College from 1916-1919.His professional career began in the Negro National League in 1920 with the Chicago based traveling team Gilkerson Union Giants, a founding member of that league. He played for them through until 1924 but his record for them is hard to track as the Giants didn\u0027t have a home stadium. From 1924-25 he played for their local rival the Chicago American Giants who were led by famous black pitcher Rube Foster. He then moved to the Indianapolis ABCs the following year (1926) and also played for a team called Dayton Marcos that year. In 1927 he moved to the Cleveland Hornets and in 1928 and possibly 1929 he moved again, this time to the Brooklyn Royal Giants.Then came the most successful stint of his career at the Homestead Grays from 1930-34, although for part of 1932 he also played for the Washington Pilots. It was in Los Angeles that Lillie became a pioneering realtor with a passion to help those less fortunate. DailyMail.com has learned that Lille built a public swimming pool behind her Los Angeles office to help underprivileged local children. The late Mrs Evans was interviewed by the Los Angeles Times newspaper back in December 1971 about the project          This is the location of the real estate office Evans held 50 years ago.

It\u0027s the first photo to emerge of her.The pool was situated at 7315 S Normandie Av, in South Los Angeles and DailyMail.com visited the site this week.Now in a state of disrepair, it is in part of the city that remains mainly populated by black and Hiic people. No one at the address or next door remembered the pool – which was built exactly 50 years ago in 1968. Lillie had converted a small parking lot into the pool and the filled-in site is now the back yard of a dilapidated row of homes.The pool was used by \u0027400 to 500 youngsters each summer\u0027 with no charge and was used by neighborhood youth groups and \u0027any kid who has supervision\u0027, Lillie said: \u0027It\u0027s about the only service I can give to the community.\u0027Meghan\u0027s relative owned and maintained the pool while a teacher from nearby Compton Community College named Harold Price offered swimming lessons to the children.Lillie was born in Tennessee, the daughter of tailor Jeremiah Ragland and seamstress Claudie Ritchie.

After we had fought for years and years, the Los Angeles Realty Board began accepting us in 1962.\u0027She added: \u0027Limitations in my business have been broken down to a great extent\u0027, however she noted that although the availability of housing for black people was vastly improved \u0027open housing is not really a reality yet.

Thomas Clarkson, Abolitionist and campaigner became a target of slave-traders, receiving several death threats and beatings, and it was not actually until 1787, that Wilberforce, as MP for Hull, became personally active in the abolitionist cause. A  biography produced shortly after their father\u0027s death in 1838, William Wilberforce\u0027s sons, Robert and Samuel, greatly downplayed Clarkson\u0027s contributionFrom the mid-1780s, Clarkson was instrumental in raising public awareness of the brutality of slavery, publishing essays, giving speeches, visiting trading ports and even stowing away on-board slave ships in order to gather evidence.In the course of his work, he soon became a target of slave-traders, receiving several death threats and beatings, and it was not actually until 1787, that Wilberforce, as MP for Hull, became personally active in the abolitionist cause.Whilst Wilberforce\u0027s stirring Parliamentary speeches were integral in putting the crucial legislative machinery in place, it was invariably the evidence acquired by Clarkson that gave them their moral weight.In a controversial biography produced shortly after their father\u0027s death in 1838, William Wilberforce\u0027s sons, Robert and Samuel, greatly downplayed Clarkson\u0027s contribution, depicting him as little more than an assistant to their more proactive and \u0027inely-inspired\u0027 father.Though Clarkson would subsequently publish a rebuttal of their \u0027cruel and unwarrantable attack\u0027 (prompting a private apology from the Wilberforce family), it was the latter\u0027s name that would become synonymous with the ending of the slave-trade in Britain.Walter Tull, Tottenham and Northampton footballer, first black officer in the British Army (1888 - 1918)  Tull, born in Folkestone in 1888 to a Barbadian father and English mother, first achieved fame as one of the first black players in the English Football League, playing for Tottenham Hotspur between 1909 and 1911, before moving to Northampton.In December 1914, Tull enlisted in the British army, rising through the ranks to become second-lieutenant despite a military injunction precluding \u0027negroes\u0027 from officer status.Though, as an officer, he was praised for his \u0027gallantry and coolness\u0027, Tull was later controversially denied a Military Cross. He was killed, in March 1918, aged 30, at the Battle of Bapaume in Northern France. His body was never found.  Walter Tull first achieved fame as one of the first black players in the English Football League, playing for Tottenham Hotspur between 1909 and 1911, before moving to Northampton. In December 1914, Tull enlisted in the British army, rising through the ranks to become second-lieutenant despite a military injunction precluding \u0027negroes\u0027 from officer status.In 2016, Tull\u0027s biographer Phil Vasili, uncovered evidence suggesting how Tull\u0027s senior officers may have colluded to prevent him from receiving the recognition to which he was, unquestionably, due. In a memo dated 19 February 1918, the Head of Recruitment to the War and Colonial Offices, General White, asserted that \u0027wooly headed n*****s\u0027 would not be required at the forthcoming spring offensive: \u0027We now refuse to post coloured men to \u0027white units\u0027, the memo went on, \u0027These n*****s must therefore go to native units if accepted.\u0027The first English king to issue a Law Code: King Æthelberht of Kent (c. 560 - 616)  Not only was Æthelberht the first English king to embrace Christianity, he was also the first to issue a written legal code, pre-empting what is normally invoked as the foundation stone of English constitutional law, Magna Carta, by over six hundred years.Conceivably, the Anglo-Saxon ruler - now forgotten - did as much to lay the foundations of early modern Britain as any English king prior to 1066.Like most Anglo-Saxon kings, exact details of Æthelberht\u0027s life and times are hard to verify.The most successful English politician of the fifteenth century: Lady Margaret Beaufort, Countess of Richmond and Derby (1433 - 1509) Twice-married by the age of twelve (and a widowed mother by the age of thirteen) Margaret devoted much of her life to the successful promotion of her only child, Henry Tudor to the English throne as Henry VII.Following Henry\u0027s victory over Richard III at Bosworth in 1485, Margaret was granted a degree of legal and social independence normally reserved only for Queens of England, including the right to hold property independent of her husband.  After allegedly being born on a slave ship, Ignatius Sancho was transported to England where he was a slave to the second Duke of Mantagu. But his intelligence did not go unnoticed and he was eventually set free and subsequently allowed to vote in electionsFirst known black man to vote in a British election: Ignatius Sancho, Writer and composer (c. 1729 - 1780) Allegedly born on board a slave ship in c. 1729 and orphaned by the age of two, Sancho was subsequently transported to England where he came under the watch of the second Duke of Montagu.Struck by the young slave\u0027s obvious intelligence, Montagu strove to educate Sancho, sharing books with him from his personal library, and cultivating his wider cultural tastes and interests. Following the duke\u0027s death in 1749, Sancho became butler to the duke\u0027s widow, one of the most important positions in an eighteenth-century aristocratic house. When the duchess died in 1751, she bequeathed Sancho an annuity of £30, as well as a year\u0027s salary to support himself with.Sancho\u0027s financial independence and status as a householder meant that he was the only known Afro-Briton qualified to vote in the parliamentary elections of 1774 and 1780.In addition to being the first known black man to vote in a British election he was also the first African to be afforded an obituary in the British press.Despite his apparent acceptance by eighteenth century English high society, Sancho\u0027s race and status as a former-slave became a source of considerable unease for those seeking to defend slavery against the growing abolitionist cause in the early nineteenth century.Not least, Sancho\u0027s deep intelligence and humanity went against those who claimed that Africans were somehow constitutionally incapable or deficient on this score.          Mary Anning achieved huge public attentions after discovering the first fossilised pterodactyl in Britain and her finding has even been said to have contributed to Darwin\u0027s theory of natural selectionPioneering Palaeontologist: Mary Anning, Fossil Collector, Palaeontologist (1799 - 1847) Born in Lyme Regis in 1799, Anning, from a young age, helped to supplement her family\u0027s modest income by selling fossils retrieved from cliffs near her childhood home.By her late teens she was making discoveries that would help to fundamentally reshape ideas of natural history and the evolution of species. In 1823, she discovered the first complete Plesiosaurus, complementing her previous discovery of a series of near-complete ichthyosaurs. In 1828, she achieved wide public attention with the discovery of the first fossilised Pterodactyl, or \u0027flying dragon\u0027, in Britain.Some scientists have suggested that Anning\u0027s findings contributed to Darwin\u0027s theory of natural selection. A poll carried out by the Royal Society in 2010, included Anning as one of the ten most influential women in British science.Anning struggled for due recognition in the male-dominated scientific community of the early 19th century, and her contributions to palaeontology went largely overlooked after her death.Many of the specimens she found were utilised by scientists and published in scientific journals without reference.She also had to overcome accusations of fraudulency from sceptical contemporaries such as the French naturalist Georges Cuvier, who accused her of fabricating new species by merging fossils from different animals.          Percy Pilcher was the first to invent the motor-powered aeroplane. But shortly after taking off in the flying machine, the tail snapped and he plunged 30ft to the ground and died from his injuries two days later (Nearly) invented the first powered aeroplane: Percy Pilcher, Pioneering Aviator (1866 - 1899)  By the end of the nineteenth century the international race to design and build a motor-powered aeroplane was heating up. Amongst those seeking to be the first to take flight was a British former naval engineer called Percy Pilcher.By September 30 1899, Pilcher was ready to demonstrate his prototype aircraft to a number of patrons and potential investors at Stanford Hall in Leicestershire. When problems with the engine prevented the launch from going ahead, Pilcher felt obliged to offer his audience a demonstration of his earlier Hawk glider. Shortly after take off the tail snapped, plunging Pilcher and his glider 30ft to the ground. He died from his injuries two days later.Four years later, the American brothers Orville and Wilbur Wright achieved immortal fame with the successful launch of their own biplane prototype in North Carolina.In 2003, researchers at the School of Aeronautics at Cranfield University successfully built and launched a triplane based, with minor modifications, on Pilcher\u0027s original designs.           Four years later after Pilcher\u0027s death, the American brothers Orville and Wilbur Wright achieved immortal fame with the successful launch of their own biplane prototype in North Carolina. Pilcher, pictured, was a partner in the firm Wilson and Pilcher Ltd, who began gliding in 1895Filmed by the BBC, the plane flew for one minute and 25 seconds, beating the first flight made by the Wright brothers in 1903 by 26 seconds.Pilcher\u0027s relative isolation as an independent engineer and early death at the age of 32 seems to have ensured that his designs and prototype died with him.The first qualified female surgeon and physician in Britain: Elizabeth Garrett Anderson, Physician, social campaigner, suffragette (1836 - 1917) Born in Whitechapel, East London, Garrett first came to prominence as a member of the Langham Place circle, an offshoot of the Society for Promoting the Employment of Women - a key focal point of the burgeoning mid-Victorian women\u0027s movement.In 1870, she became the first woman to obtain the qualification of Medical Doctor, and, in 1873, was finally admitted to membership of the British Medical Association.  Elizabeth Garret Anderson became the first woman to obtain the qualification of Medical Doctor, and, in 1873, was finally admitted to membership of the British Medical Association. She remained the only woman member of the BMA for 19 years following a vote to bar any further female admission in 1878Under pressure to resign after the association voted to bar any further female admission in 1878, she remained the only woman member of the BMA for nineteen years.In 1908, she was also elected as the first woman mayor in England, in the district of Aldeburgh.Anderson\u0027s numerous attempts to gain admission to study at medical school were denied.When, in 1865, she passed the society of Apothecaries examinations which allowed her to become a doctor, the society changed it rules to bar other women from entering the profession through this route.The British Medical Register also refused to recognise her medical degree from the University of Paris.Pioneer of inoculation against smallpox: Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, Aristocrat, writer and early pioneer of smallpox inoculation in England, (1689 - 1762) Whilst Edward Jenner (1749-1823), is often identified as the founder of modern vaccination techniques against smallpox, the 18th century aristocrat Mary Wortley Montagu arguably also deserves a place in the early history of immunology. It was during her time in Turkey in 1721, as wife of the British ambassador to the Ottoman court, that Lady Mary was first introduced to the local practice of variolation as a means of protection against smallpox.           Arstocrat Lady Mary Wortley Montagu is often identified as the founder of modern vaccination techniques against smallpox after being introduced to the local Turkish practice of variolation as a means of protection against smallpox. Her tenacity and commitment have been described by one historian as \u0027unparalleled in the annals of medical advance\u0027Returning to England, Lady Mary became an enthusiastic advocate of the Turkish method, fighting against considerable scepticism and resistance from doctors and wider society. Her tenacity and commitment have been described by one historian as \u0027unparalleled in the annals of medical advance.\u0027Lady Mary\u0027s promotion of the controversial foreign medical procedure prompted fierce debate in the British press and in wider society.Mary herself became subject to numerous slanderous and abusive attacks from journalists, medical practitioners and even clergymen.By the late 1720s, her infamy was such that people in the street would \u0027hoot at her as an unnatural mother\u0027.Working-class leader of the suffragette movement in early 20th century: Annie Kenney, Suffragette (1879 - 1953)           Annie Kenney is a little known Suffragette who was the first to speak and among the first to be arrested after she and Christbel Pankhurst unfurled a banner demanding the vote for women during a political meeting in 1905A name largely absent from the recent centenary commemorations of the 1918 Representation of the People Act was that of Annie Kenney. Born in the West Riding of Yorkshire in 1879, Kenney began her working life in cotton mill at the age of 10.Once described as \u0027after the Pankhursts\u0027, the most daring and influential of the Suffragettes\u0027, she was the first to speak, and among the first to be arrested, after she and Christabel Pankhurst unfurled a banner demanding the vote for women at a political meeting, attended by Sir Edward Grey and Winston Churchill, in Manchester in 1905 - an event which effectively launched the era of suffragette militancy.The early labour movement\u0027s focus on industrial solidarity over women\u0027s rights, combined with her class meant it was harder for Kenney to achieve the same kind of recognition and authority as that produced by the \u0027upper-class\u0027 Pankhursts.Kenney\u0027s brother Robert, would later accuse his sister and other suffragettes of \u0027robbing the Socialist movement of its finest elements and wasting them in a fight for the vote, which was of little or no use compared with industrial solidarity and the making of Socialist converts.\u0027Pioneer in the theory and design of suspension bridges: Sarah Guppy, Inventor, Social Reformer (1770 - 1852)  In 1811, Guppy secured a patent for \u0027a new mode of constructing and erecting bridges and rail-roads without arches or sterlings, whereby the danger of being washed away by floods is avoided.\u0027The patent went on to describe a form of hanging bridge, connected by interlocking framing, which removed the need for stanchions in the riverbed itself. Guppy\u0027s proposed design was largely intended as a way of overcoming the difficulties of bridging the Bristol Avon - later famously addressed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel, who built the world-famous Clifton Suspension Bridge.A variant of her patent was also later asserted to have been employed by Thomas Telford in his construction of the Menai Suspension Bridge in 1826.Prohibitive social mores of the early 18th and 19th centuries, particularly those related to the place of women, as well as Guppy\u0027s own modesty all helped to ensure that her contributions to 19th century British industrial innovation were largely overlooked.She once suggested \u0027it is unpleasant to speak of oneself - it may seem boastful particularly in a woman.\u0027                                                        "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/17/18/4C5D364800000578-5741371-image-m-42_1526578806007.jpg","title":"Im Batman Michael Keaton sends Kent State graduation wild iconic line","story":"    Michael Keaton uttered the famous two words \u0027I\u0027m Batman\u0027 at Kent State\u0027s graduation    The actor played the Caped Crusader in Tim Burton\u0027s 1989 Batman and the 1992 sequelKeaton gave a near-20-minute inspirational speech with personal stories about his time at the university. He told the students that nothing compares to working hard toward their goals. \u0027If I could have found my way around hard work I would have,\u0027 he said. After receiving a plaque for his appearance as the key note speaker, the actor took over the microphone to share a quick message with the graduates.\u0027I\u0027ve got two words that I want you all to remember,\u0027 he said.  \u0027They\u0027re very important, and if I leave you with anything, I\u0027m going to leave you with these two words.

And, naturally, he would receive an RSVP from the Palace, for he had ‘always supported her, she knows that’, he said, recalling how he had taken Meghan to feed the ducks and babysat for her when she was little.Oh yes — and there was bound to be ‘a plus-one for Darlene’, he added, glancing at his 36-year-old fiancée, perched at his burly shoulder and hanging on his every word.\u0027Why can\u0027t she just say she loves him?\u0027: Social media users...Does Harry need a wife or a mother? Diana¿s death left her...Royal Wedding: The celebrity guests invited to Prince Harry...\u0027I have always cared for my father\u0027: Meghan breaks her...Share this article‘I would love to meet the Royals. I’d buy the prettiest dress,’ chirruped Darlene Blount, having, apparently, forgiven Thomas for drawing a gun on her less than three months earlier, during one of their drunken, violent quarrels.Fast forward 12 months and that two-hour conversation — which I listened to again yesterday on tape — sounds utterly surreal and, on reflection, rather sad. Events in the Royal Wedding drama are moving faster even than Thomas Jnr does when someone offers to buy a round of drinks at the Cedarwood Saloon, his local bar in Grants Pass, Oregon.However, with 24 hours to go before Meghan and Harry tie the knot, the state of play is as follows: the bride’s father — shamed by the revelation that he colluded with a paparazzi photographer — now lies in a Mexican hospital, recovering from a heart operation made necessary, he claims, by his son’s bad-mouthing of Meghan.          Family at war: Meghan at 11 (far left) with her father, Samantha and nephews Tyler and ThomasMeanwhile, Thomas Jnr’s sons, Thomas, 27, who runs a Domino’s Pizza franchise with his husband, and brother Tyler, 25, a cannabis farmer (it’s legal to grow the drug in Oregon) have indeed pitched up in London (with their glammed-up mother, Tracy Dooley, in tow).Tyler plans to cash in on his association with Meghan by launching a super-strong strain of cannabis called Markle’s Sparkle.They are here to watch the wedding as ‘pundits’ in an ITV studio. Or, at least, they were until yesterday when, wisely, we might think, executives at Good Morning Britain reportedly decided to drop them.          Meghan Markle\u0027s half-brother Thomas Junior wrote a poisonous ‘open letter’ to Harry  branding his sister ‘a jaded, shallow, conceited woman  Mr Markle Jr had recently penned an ‘open letter’ and told Harry: ‘As more time passes to your royal wedding, it became very clear that this is the biggest mistake in royal wedding history\u0027As for Meghan’s paternal uncles, Bishop Fred Markle and his brother Mick, a retired diplomat, these respectable septuagenarians will remain in America, along with various other snubbed relatives.Among them is Meghan’s maternal uncle Joffre, a graphic designer, who is actually two years younger than Meghan and is the product of her late maternal grandfather Alvin’s second marriage, to a lady named Ava Burrows.As he and Meghan are a similar age, and grew up in the same neighbourhood of Los Angeles, Joffre was genuinely close to her when they were children and resumed their friendship when she was an actress in Hollywood.Though he has shown admirable discretion during the pre-wedding hoopla, declining many interview requests, he, too, has been overlooked, leaving his mother feeling understandably hurt.    Meghan Markle pictured as a baby being held by her father Thomas who will not attend the royal wedding following a heart operation          Meghan Markle (right) with her sister Samantha (left) who has been snubbed from the wedding on Saturday          Samantha Markle gave a bombshell interview to US media where she insisted she had \u0027freedom of speech\u0027 and the right to criticise her half-sister Meghan‘I want everything to work out and wish them a great day,’ Ava Burrows told me this week. ‘Even though I might not be happy about how it has been handled as far as my son is concerned.’The retired teacher added: ‘That’s my boy who’s been left out and I’m a momma bear!’So, flying in the face of Meghan’s brother’s fanciful prediction last May, it seems — apart from her mother, Doria, who is expected to walk her up the aisle tomorrow — there will be no place in the chapel for anyone in the Markle family. The one thing Thomas Jnr got right when he contemplated the likely guest list, however, was that there would not be a pew for his sister, Samantha.It wasn’t difficult to forecast her absence, though, because Samantha, 53, who suffers from multiple sclerosis and uses a wheelchair, had already portrayed Meghan as ‘narcissistic and selfish’ and claimed her half-sister had disowned her because of her disability.Since then, her rants — delivered by the U.S. celebrity news website TMZ, which has also become the chosen mouthpiece for Thomas Markle Snr — have grown more wounding and bizarre by the day.          Prince Harry and Meghan Markle arrive at Windsor Castle ahead of their big dayYesterday, hitting back at Meghan’s reported pleas for her to stop sniping, she even invoked the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, saying angrily: ‘She’s not going to tell me that I can’t speak about my life. I’m not going to take it. She’s way out of her league . . . there is something in this country called freedom of speech. Meghan doesn’t have a copyright on that.’What, then, of Thomas Jnr? Having written a poisonous ‘open letter’ to Harry just over a fortnight ago, branding his sister ‘a jaded, shallow, conceited woman’ who would ‘make a joke’ of the Prince and the Royal Family and urging him to call off the ‘fake fairytale’ wedding, he appears to have had a truly Damascene conversion.The 52-year-old jobbing glazier has been flown to Britain by a redtop tabloid — no doubt, in return for yet another fat pay cheque — and was yesterday photographed posing beside one of the Queen’s guardsmen at Windsor Castle, his bleary eyes filled with awe.He now claims he hadn’t meant to hurt Meghan when he penned that cruel letter, published in a U.S. magazine, insisting he wrote it only because he and his family had been under intense pressure since the wedding was announced and he wanted to ‘shame the Palace’ into helping them.Audaciously, in his father’s absence, he is now trying to play the family’s elder statesman.  Meghan\u0027s nephew Tyler Dooley (pictured left) and his girlfriend Sandra Bazan (right) have not been invited to the wedding but were arrived at Heathrow airport on Monday          Megan\u0027s sister-in-law Tracey and nephew Tyler Dooley are pictured leaving a hotel in Waterloo‘The fact Dad’s not well enough to travel makes me want more than ever to be as supportive as I can to Meg,’ he drawled. ‘All I want is to see Meg happy and I hope she has found that with Harry.’Forgetting that he shared the family home with Meghan only briefly, when he was a teenager, and hasn’t spoken to his half-sister for many years, he added: ‘Knowing her as well as I do, and despite her job, there will be no acting on Saturday for sure. She’ll be unable to hide her happiness.’Quite what Meghan must be feeling as she prepares for the biggest day of her life, knowing her troublesome brother and various members of his clan lurk not a million miles from St George’s Chapel, we can but imagine.From the tranquillity of her home in the Californian desert — where I visited her last year — Ava Burrows summed up the car crash events of recent days with customary sagacity: ‘Family dynamics can be trying under normal circumstances but, in this family, under these circumstances, they are just plain crazy.’Weary of the hype, incidentally, Mrs Burrows has decided against getting up at 3am, West Coast time, to watch the wedding.           Tracey\u0027s son Tyler is developing a strain of cannabis called \u0027Markle\u0027s Sparkle\u0027 in the US state of Oregon, known for its relaxed drug laws    Tyler with his girlfriend Sandra (left) and with his mother Tracy, rightIndeed, though she will record the televised coverage for her invalid mother, who lives with her, she says she might never view it.The same goes for Meghan’s Uncle Mick, the retired diplomat.Puzzled and upset at being ignored (not least because he used his influence to get Meghan an internship at the U.S. Embassy in Argentina after she graduated), the 78-year-old, who lives in Florida, five time zones back from London, has also decided against setting his alarm.Whatever we might think of Meghan’s decision to exclude her family — be they blameless or otherwise — it means we can expect a scene of stark disparity in the chapel tomorrow.The right-hand side, where the groom’s contingent traditionally sit, will be packed with Harry’s family members, close and distant. The left, reserved for the bride’s guests, is likely to be filled with her high-flown new circle of friends, such as tennis queen Serena Williams, Jessica Mulroney, daughter-in-law of the former Canadian prime minister, and her co-stars in the TV drama Suits.          Thomas Markle admitted to staging  paparazzi photos (pictured) with an agency for money          Thomas Markle is seen on surveillance video entering an internet cafe with photographer Jeff Rayner to set up staged photosOn which side of the chapel David and Victoria Beckham will be seated, we can’t be sure. For those unacquainted with the Markle family’s chequered history, perhaps I should explain how this extraordinary state of affairs came about.The Markles are ided by many long-standing feuds, but the most bitter is between Thomas Jnr and Samantha, who loathe one another with a vengeance.The children of Meghan’s father’s first marriage, they were raised in Chicago — where Thomas Snr worked as a TV lighting technician — but when they were very young, their parents orced and they moved to live in the backwoods of New Mexico with their mother, Roslyn.Thomas Snr, meanwhile, decamped to Hollywood, working on the hit TV series Married With Children and marrying Meghan’s mother, Doria, 12 years his junior, who was temping at the studio.When Samantha was in her early teens, with visions of forging an acting career, she went to live with them, followed by Thomas Jnr.            The future princess\u0027 family are a mix of colourful characters that include a reformed alcoholic, a bishop, and even a cannabis farmerAs I learned when researching Meghan’s life story, however, the arrangement was a disaster from the outset. By many accounts, Samantha was deeply jealous of her baby half-sister (though she strenuously denies this), feeling that Meghan was claiming all her father’s attention.Matters worsened as Meghan grew older and her acting career began to blossom — while Samantha’s foundered.According to Roslyn, 71, Samantha is ‘not a nice person’ and also resented Doria, allegedly telling friends her stepmother was ‘the maid because she is black’.Samantha has since had an unhappy life. She was first married to a lawyer from Virginia, but they split up and he took custody of their two children.Her second marriage was also a failure, and her third child, daughter Noel, 19, despises her.She claims to have been a model and actress, though, if we believe her brother, she only ever had one or two bit-parts, courtesy of her father, and one modelling assignment, for a jeans commercial.Thomas Jnr says she also worked as a shop assistant, before joining the U.S. Air Force, but claims that she has sponged shamelessly off her father, contributing to his recent bankruptcy.With a tell-all book about Meghan in the pipeline, Samantha now calls herself a writer and ‘mental health counsellor’. She was diagnosed with MS in 2008.Thomas Jnr’s life has been no less difficult. After working as a lowly-paid Hollywood prop-shifter (again, thanks to his father’s connections), he drifted from job to job, and woman to woman, before marrying Tracy.  On the go: Meghan\u0027s mother Doria was picked up at her California home as she made her way to LAX on TuesdayThough they had two sons, Tyler and Thomas — or ‘TJ’, as he is known — he says the relationship was so fraught that they lived ‘as man and wife’ for only a few months.As Tracy is reportedly a recovering alcoholic, and he has long-standing problems with drink, this isn’t surprising.In fairness, Tracy has sprung to her ex-husband’s defence in recent months, not least when he was arrested for threatening Darlene with a gun. But TJ is less forgiving, saying he feels humiliated by his father’s erratic behaviour, and his outbursts about Meghan, and that his father and aunt Samantha are both ‘crazy’.Given the goings-on in recent days, we might think this something of an understatement — and you can bet your life there is plenty more embarrassment to come from the madcap Markles.Perhaps Meghan is wondering whether she should have invited the whole sorry lot of them. After all, it might have been better to have these loose cannons inside the wedding hall, rather than taking pot shots from outside."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/18/09/4C5B072300000578-5742783-image-a-6_1526630840953.jpg","title":"Royal super fans camp Windsor Castle two nights royal wedding","story":"    Police teams are even patrolling Windsor along the Thames today in an  extraordinary security operation ahead of the royal wedding  Police spotters and snipers are lining the 2.6mile route set to be followed by Meghan and Harry and are ready to shoot to kill          A police officer watches on from the rooftops of Windsor during one of Britain\u0027s biggest security operations for years          Soldiers have also been drafted in to secure a ring of steel around Windsor Castle ahead of the biggest UK royal wedding since 2011          Armed officers are on patrol and MailOnline understands there also undercover officers and MI5 ready to act if needed  Superfans camped on the streets overnight to secure their spots to see the procession through the Berkshire town tomorrow          A guide to the timings of the event on Saturday, from when the first guests arrive at 9.30am to the reception at 7pmIt is Thames Valley Police\u0027s biggest ever operation and they are relying heavily on Scotland Yard and MI5 for support.It came as superfans camped on the streets overnight to secure their spots to see the procession through the Berkshire town tomorrow. Armed police and specially trained sniffer dogs are patrolling the streets of  the royal town, with squadrons of uniformed officers with machine guns toured the town in rotation.Harry loves Meghan because she \u0027cares about people just like...‘Sorry, mate, that job’s full’: What Prince Harry told Mike...Getting their party shoes on!

I now have the freedom to do what I want to do. I\u0027m a lot fitter, healthier, and travelling the world.\u0027          He was treated at Great Ormond Street Hospital in London where he met Princess Diana as a teenager, and has had a kidney transplant about once every five to ten years          His problems were detected shortly after he was born, and he was spent his entire life being treated for the potentially fatal condition. Darren is pictured with his brother lee as a childHe has had five kidney transplants - the maximum number that any kidney transplant patient in Britain has received.Darren had his first kidney transplant aged five years old, his second aged 16, and his third aged 21.At 24 he was given another new kidney, and received his fifth transplant in 2011, from a pal, Lee Ferrigan, whose wife Keisha had died of stomach cancer aged just 32.\u0027He said to me, \u0027I couldn\u0027t help her, but I can help you,\u0027 Darren said. We went through all the tests and it came back a perfect match. Fingers crossed it will be the last one.\u0027The life-saving gift came as Darren had nearly begun to give up hope, having had nine friends and his family members test negative for a match.          Father-of-two Darren married his wife Amanda ten years ago, and they have two daughters, Imani, aged three, and Briella, aged two          Medical developments have made hugely positive changes for Darren, allowing him to receive treatment at home in Milton Keynes, Bucks, when necessaryIn between transplants, Darren was kept alive by being hooked up to a dialysis machine which removed toxins from his blood.He said: \u0027I\u0027m not sure how many kidneys I have got inside me. They normally dissolve over time.\u0027I know when I had my last transplant they were talking about where they were going to put it.          Darren He works as a social media manager, which also allows him flexibility around hospital appointments and working remotely\u0027As it stands I can\u0027t tell how many kidneys I\u0027ve inside me, whether it\u0027s five or three or one.\u0027To take out a kidney which is causing problems is longer surgery and takes longer to recover from. They never felt it necessary to take one out.\u0027His problems were detected shortly after he was born, and he was spent his entire life being treated for the potentially fatal condition.Darren said: \u0027When I got home, my parents knew there was a problem. All I would do is sleep all day. I didn\u0027t wake up for feeding.\u0027When they would feed me it would drop out of my mouth.\u0027He was initially taken to the family\u0027s GP in Kettering, Northants, and from there was rushed to Great Ormond Street Hospital where he was diagnosed with chronic kidney failure.\u0027My first transplant was aged five years old,\u0027 Darren said. \u0027It has been crazy.\u0027At times the demands of his medical condition meant he was visiting a hospital three times a week, and was on dialysis three times a day.A catheter was inserted into his lower stomach and a CAPD dialysis functioned like a mechanical kidney.But medical developments have made hugely positive changes for Darren, allowing him to receive treatment at home in Milton Keynes, Bucks, when necessary.He works as a social media manager, which also allows him flexibility around hospital appointments and working remotely.          The couple were desperate for a child and began to investigate infertility treatment - but then Amanda became pregnant unexpectedly and gave birth in June, 2014. \u0027We had two beautiful children naturally, they are a blessing,\u0027 Darren saidDarren said: \u0027With the medical condition I couldn\u0027t really hold down a job as I was spending so much time in hospital.\u0027I lost one of my kidneys because I went back to work too soon.\u0027One day I felt really tired and lethargic and the doctors said \u0027I\u0027m sorry, your kidney is not working.\u0027Miraculously he was able to become a father without using IVF, which he and Amanda feared they may have to resort to.\u0027The doctors said it was unlikely I would be able to have children,\u0027 Darren said.\u0027Nothing was happening, then we went to the doctors.\u0027They said with your medical condition it is unlikely you will be able to have children naturally.\u0027The couple were desperate for a child and began to investigate infertility treatment - but then Amanda became pregnant unexpectedly and gave birth in June, 2014.\u0027We had two beautiful children naturally, they are a blessing,\u0027 Darren said.He had been honest with his 21-year-old bride about the prognosis, which was uncertain at the time they tied the knot.Darren said: \u0027My wife is really supportive. We got married when she was 21, and she was on the cusp of her career as a makeup artist.\u0027Before we got married, I said \u0027this is my condition, I don\u0027t know how long I will last.\u0027\u0027But the crazy woman still married me.\u0027All the organs Darren received apart from the most recent one from Lee had come from the organ donor register.But Darren does not believe that the opt-out system for the regist, which has been implemented in Scotland and Wales, should be introduced in England.He said: \u0027I do feel it should be down to choice.\u0027Nobody should feel pressured or obligated to do it.\u0027It is a decision that should not be made lightly.\u0027He added: \u0027For people who say they don\u0027t want to go under the knife and take time off work, it is not that bad.\u0027My friend Lee, who gave me my last kidney, was in and out of hospital in three days.\u0027Now they can do keyhole surgery.\u0027He has now written a memoir, How I Survived Five Kidney Transplants And Won. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/18/09/4C56C8C800000578-5743893-image-a-17_1526632948448.jpg","title":"Never seen photos Britains rock festival Hendrix Cream Pink Floyd","story":"    The Jimi Hendrix Experience play the Tulip Bulb Auction Hall in Spalding, England, at what was arguably the first ever rock festival, Barbecue \u002767.

Windsor is expected to see...Share this articleTwo bridemaids in silver dresses held her train as she walked through the streets along with her daughter who was a flower girl. The bride-to-be had spent her past night as a single woman in the Hart and Garter Hotel directly opposite Windsor Castle which was full of television crews from all around the world reporting on the day.  She had momentarily popped out onto the balcony of the hotel in her bridal gear for her very own royal moment. She said: \u0027I feel amazing. This is surreal. I feel like a princess.\u0027          Their own royal moment: Vicky Compson and her groom Aron Hallam step out onto the balcony after their wedding. Vicky, who was mistaken for a Meghan Markle lookalike, said she \u0027felt like a princess\u0027Onlookers who had travelled to Windsor for tomorrow\u0027s event said at first they thought it was a Meghan look-a-like.Susan Shott, 53, said the wedding \u0027It\u0027s so exciting and romantic. The bride looked beautiful.\u0027Moire Liddle, 72, years, from Scotland, said: \u0027It\u0027s lovely, good for them. I thought she was a Meghan lookalike at first. They all look beautiful.\u0027          Vicky, 33, smiles with her bridesmaids and holds her daughter ahead of walking down the aisleThe young couple had visiting a plethora of venues across the country, and even dabbling with the idea of going to Ibiza or Las Vegas, before settling on having a \u0027quiet\u0027 wedding closer to their home in the village of Datchet, Berkshire.  But the loved-up couple\u0027s choice to exchange their vows under The Queen\u0027s brass chandeliers won\u0027t be the only connections to the Royal Family that day.Speaking before their wedding 33-year- old Vicky, said: \u0027We\u0027re getting married the day before, thank God.          Crowds of well-wishers anticipating the Royal Wedding stand behind barriers as the bride makes her way from her hotel to Windsor Guildhall\u0027That wouldn\u0027t have been good if we were. I\u0027d want to cancel it if I was getting married on the same day.\u0027It was a relief it wasn\u0027t on the same day. Because we were on tenterhooks really. They announced they were getting married, and then I thought \u0027oh don\u0027t worry they\u0027re going to be in London or something like that\u0027. And then it came up on the news that they announced the location. Then it was spring. Then it was May. And I was like, no. C\u0027mon.\u0027Then we waited for a couple of weeks then they announced the date. It came up breaking news on my phone and I was like, \u0027oh my God, look\u0027. So, phew. We just took it as it was.           Hairdresser Vicky, 33, holds her daughter\u0027s hand and a bouquet of pink and white flowers as she walks through Windsor\u0027The reason we booked there was because we thought it would be nice and quiet. It was convenient. Aron doesn\u0027t like all the attention as it is.\u0027So now it\u0027s just the complete opposite for us. I\u0027m really excited and I\u0027m loving it.\u0027Hairstylist Vicky, her mother and daughter were booked into the Hart and Garter directly opposite Windsor Castle which has view that peaks into the Lower Ward next to St George\u0027s Chapel where Prince Harry and Meghan with say their vows.          Vicky stayed directly opposite Windsor Castle the night before her big day. She then made a procession across the townDespite being booked for months the hotel emailed them and cancelled the booking as the rooms had all been let to foreign media outlets for the royal nuptials.Aron said: \u0027It was saying you\u0027re not staying in the room anymore. The broadcasters book it at the beginning of each year in case of an event like this so we couldn\u0027t have the room. But obviously they didn\u0027t know at the time it was for a wedding. After lengthy negotiations we\u0027ve still got a room there.\u0027  Devastated the bride-to-be did not give up and negotiated with the hotel until another room was found.\u0027Then I was worried about how all the flowers and bits and pieces were going to get to us at the hotel.          Onlookers lean over barrier to get a glance of the blushing bride who has been saving for three years to pay for the £10,000 wedding\u0027And I have to worry about now is negotiating the walk from the hotel to the Guildhall on the morning in my wedding dress as there will be lots of people and security.\u0027I did think about cancelling it entirely but the town is going to look beautiful and it will be very special.\u0027That\u0027s not where the similarities end though, as Vicky, just like Meghan, won\u0027t have her father walk her down the aisle.And they too will be paying for their own wedding, after three years of saving up £10,000 for their special day.          Vicky, like Meghan, was not accompanied down the aisle by her father. She considered Ibiza to get married before choosing Windsor, near her home\u0027We are really indecisive. So when we got engaged it took us three years because we actually looked at a lot of places. I even put a deposit down on somewhere and we lost the deposit\u0027.\u0027We all went to Ibiza and looked at venue there. That was lovely. We loved that. But then I thought my grandparents wouldn\u0027t be able to make it. And we looked at Vegas. But for the children and the kids to go there it\u0027s not really practical and that was just adding up too much.\u0027So we have had a look at a lot of places. We went to so many hotels. We went to Liverpool because Aron\u0027s a massive Liverpool fan.\u0027It\u0027s been fun and now this. We thought, actually let\u0027s do it nice and close. Nice and quiet and do it in the school holidays, and now this has happened. Pretty surreal isn\u0027t it.\u0027          Vicky says she was really happy for Harry and liked Meghan Markle - and didn\u0027t feel upstaged by the royal nupitalsHair stylist Vicky and self-employed electrician Aron\u0027s big day will be a lot more low key than Prince Harry and Meghan\u0027s with a total of 70 guests, not that the soon-to-be newlyweds begrudge that.\u0027I wouldn\u0027t say I feel angry about it,\u0027 said the mother-of-two.\u0027I mean it was stressful. It\u0027s amazing for them that he\u0027s found someone. I don\u0027t hold any grudges. It\u0027s nice that he\u0027s found love. And it\u0027s lovely he\u0027s getting married a day after me in Windsor. \u0027I\u0027ve always liked him because he\u0027s a bit out there.. He\u0027s the bad one. He\u0027s the one who has fun by the looks of it. Obviously I don\u0027t know a lot about her, but I speak to a lot of people as I\u0027m a hairdresser. It all seems very positive about her.\u0027The only thing I thought was they\u0027ve been together five minutes and it\u0027s took me this long to get my day and now this is happening. That\u0027s the only way I can say I feel about it. But they may have been together longer than we know. But we\u0027ve got a nice story. And it\u0027s a nice joyous lovely story. So that\u0027s what\u0027s nice that\u0027s come out of this.\u0027And the Royals they are nice people. The Royals are good people. It\u0027s nice to have a connection in that way.\u0027          Vicky wore a floor length ivory dress and lace veil to her wedding. Her bridesmaids wore silver dresses and the groom a blue suitAnd while it\u0027s suggested Prince Harry and Meghan will be enjoying the exotic locations such as Barbados or Botswana for their honeymoon, Vicky and Aron will instead jet off to Mellieha in Malta, along with their two children, Elliot, 10, and Sienna, 7.  So are the couple worried their most important day of their lives might get overshadowed?\u0027No, because everyone is going to be able to make it,\u0027 says Vicky.\u0027I\u0027m very chilled and relaxed about it.\u0027It was 15 years ago the pair met at Uxbridge high street pub The Good Yarn when Vicky \u0027heckled\u0027 at Aron after his phone went off \u0027like in Trigger Happy TV\u0027.          Police and photographers flanked the bride as she made her way down to the Windsor Guildhall \u0027He came in and his phone went off and I was like giving it some,\u0027 said Vicky.\u0027We were just having a bit of banter probably just taking the mickey.\u0027 \u0027And I thought I could probably get her number, so I did,\u0027 he tells me with a wry smile.\u0027We were young,\u0027 explains Vicky. \u0027I was 18, just turning 19. And he had just turned 20 and I thought he was really old. It developed from there.\u0027Twelve years later, Aron thought it was the perfect time to \u0027stumble over\u0027 and get down on one knee to pop the question at The Grand Hotel in Brighton.Vicky said: \u0027I obviously wanted to get married for a long time but actually it\u0027s quite nice at the age we are.\u0027After all that time. We went back to the hotel as we were going out that evening and he just popped it out then. He doesn\u0027t like any audiences or anything like that as he gets quite shy. They say opposites attract.\u0027It was nice and quiet and intimate and of course I was going to say yes. There was nothing to be worried about.\u0027 Another happy couple also tied the knot at Windsor Guildhall today.     Karen Lewis and Reggie Palmer also booked the Guildhall for their wedding before the announcement of the Royal Wedding. The couple, from Horton in Slough, posed for pictures outside the venue.

Shortly afterwards, when asked how he was feeling, he said: \u0027Great, thanks. How are you feeling?\u0027Meghan O\u0027Shea, aged seven, from Holyport in Berkshire, was among those who chatted with Harry.The prince noted the \u0027H\u0027 in the little girl\u0027s name - like his soon-to-be wife Meghan - and she said he remarked: \u0027Is that like the one I\u0027m going to marry? There\u0027s not very many Meghans with a \u0027H\u0027 around.\u0027Little Meghan said of her namesake: \u0027I think she\u0027s very nice.\u0027 As Harry was returning to the castle, he spotted a friend in the crowd who has made it home from a big cycling trip just in time for the wedding.Dean Stott, 41, travelled the 14,000-mile Pan American Highway in 99 days, 12 hours and 56 minutes, knocking an astonishing 17 days off the previous best. The former special forces soldier trained with the prince for six weeks in 2007 and the pair have stayed close, with the groom-to-be finding time to congratulate his guest on the record-breaking achievement.Afterwards Mr Stott said it was the first time he and Harry had seen each other since he returned, adding that he had not quite realised the magnitude of the wedding. Mr Stott said he was \u0027honoured and privileged\u0027 to be attending the wedding.   Accompanied by his older brother, Harry was met with loud cheers from the crowd as he emerged from the castle wearing a grey jacket, white shirt and slacks          \u0027I just want to go to the pub!\u0027: Harry pointed at the Horse and Groom pub behind adoring fans and photographers in Windsor this evening           Harry and Meghan are pictured among a crowd of well-wishers in the groom\u0027s final public appearance as a single man          Harry holds a teddy bear with a red jumper as he and Prince William greet crowds outside Windsor Castle this evening  Prince Harry walks around in front of Windsor Castle as he greeted well-wishers on his last evening of bachelorhoodAt tomorrow\u0027s service the bride  will walk through the Nave and Prince Charles will be waiting  at the start of the Quire - half way down the chapel - to take her to the altar.A source told MailOnline: \u0027It was something that she made clear she wanted to do when she and Prince Harry started planning their wedding last November\u0027.Many royal fans appear delighted at Meghan\u0027s decision because Charles does not have a daughter - but some critics believe the star, 36, should have plumped for Doria.The dramatic twist came as Prince Philip, 96, confirmed he will be well enough to attend the ceremony after successfully recovering from a hip operation last month. Harry\u0027s father is vastly more experienced than Doria at appearing at large-scale public events amid intense scrutiny. He also performed the duty for Alexandra Knatchbull, the daughter of his close friend, Lord Brabourne, in 2016. Meghan\u0027s father Thomas Markle was forced to pull out of performing the fatherly duty after undergoing heart surgery in a dramatic upset just two days before the wedding.             One member of the adoring crowd gave Harry what is possibly his and Meghan\u0027s first wedding present - a fluffy teddy bear    Outside the Horse and Groom pub, Harry shook hands with fans and spoke to children in the crowd while well-wishers filmed his every move on their mobile phones           Prince Harry is given the teddy bear by one of his well-wishers outside Windsor Castle this eveningIn a statement, Kensington Palace said: \u0027Ms Meghan Markle has asked His Royal Highness The Prince of Wales to accompany her down the aisle of the Quire of St George\u0027s Chapel on her Wedding Day.\u0027The Prince of Wales is pleased to be able to welcome Ms Markle to The Royal Family in this way.\u0027Until today Prince Charles was the second favourite at 31 yesterday to walk Meghan down the aisle, with her mother Doria Ragland the favourite at 13.

The Duke was taken to the private King Edward VII hospital in central London on April 3, for surgery to replace his joint with a prosthetic implant.He underwent the planned procedure the following day and left hospital on April 13.The duke, who retired from royal duties in August 2017, has since continued his recovery in Windsor.His appearance at tomorrow\u0027s wedding will please the royal fans, with whom he is extremely poplar.                                                     Last night royal fans were seen camping out outside the castle to ensure a good view of the planned procession, using sleeping bags and even folding chairs after local police banned tents. Yesterday they witnessed a full rehearsal in which a carriage and members of the armed forces paraded through the streets of Windsor. Meghan has pleaded for her 73-year-old father, who is recovering from heart surgery in Mexico after revelations about his alleged collusion with a paparazzi photographer, to be given \u0027space\u0027. In the statement, which she is said to have written herself, Miss Markle, 36, said: \u0027Sadly, my father will not be attending our wedding.\u0027I have always cared for my father and hope he can be given the space he needs to focus on his health.\u0027I would like to thank everyone who has offered generous messages of support. Please know how much Harry and I look forward to sharing our special day with you on Saturday.\u0027 Amid criticism from some in the extended Markle family, sources close to Miss Markle yesterday insisted that she and Harry, 33, had offered both her parents substantial \u0027support and advice\u0027 as to how to handle the global interest since they started dating in 2016.And friends told the Mail that contrary to claims by her half-siblings, Samantha Markle and Thomas Markle Jnr, that she had left their intensely private father to deal with the paparazzi on his own, she had been in \u0027frequent\u0027 touch with him by phone and text, including in recent days.It is understood Mr Markle told his daughter personally that he would not be medically fit enough to fly to the UK.  It was claimed yesterday that he was recovering after having three stents implanted in arteries following a heart attack at home in Mexico eight days ago, and that he had said it would \u0027take a long time to heal\u0027.In return, Miss Markle was said to have told him that she loved him and supported him, regardless of the paparazzi photograph debacle.            A man puts a flag up above a shop featuring Harry and Meghan decorations in Windsor ahead of the royal wedding           People with Canadian flags camp out in Windsor ahead of the wedding of Harry and Meghan tomorrow          A group of royal wedding enthusiasts hold up flags and Harry and Meghan memorabilia outside Windsor Castle  The Royal Standard flies over Windsor Castle showing the Queen is in residence with the tow below a sea of Union Flag bunting today          In the town huge crowds of people have gathered on the eve of Meghan and Harry\u0027s wedding in the grounds of the castlePolice, the Army and the security services are forming a £30million ring of steel to protect the couple and the 100,000 people expected to visit the Berkshire town - but some armed officers took the time to pose with some Meghan fans  Royal fans from Britain, America and around the world are gathering outside Windsor Castle in huge numbers today with many wearing flags, costumes and hats          Sniffer dogs protect the huge numbers in Windsor today as part of the biggest security operation of recent times          One lucky bride, Vicky Compson, got to feel what it was like to be a princess for the day when she walked through the route Meghan and Harry will follow  to her own wedding today          Newlyweds Vicky and Aron Hallam then smiled after sharing a kiss during their reception at the Prince Harry pub in Windsor           Isabelle Sherlock and Charlie Twitchett, both ten, play Meghan Markle and Prince Harry for the day as they leave Fleetwood Methodist Church in Lancashire as  hundreds of primary school children staged their own version of the royal wedding today  Will Shepherd and Sienna Harrison, four-year-old cousins, played Harry and Meghan for the day at a nursery in Orrell, Wigan          School children wave flags on the Long Walk ahead of the wedding of the year tomorrow    Meghan and Harry will spend the evening apart this evening and the next time they will see each other again will be at the altar           Charles and Camilla were pictured leaving Kensington Palace by helicopter yesterday and this may have been when Meghan asked her future father-in-law if he would step in  This is how Meghan\u0027s entrance to St George\u0027s Chapel will unfold tomorrow and how Charles will meet her halfway          Kensington Palace has said that the Prince of Wales will accompany her down the aisle of the Quire of St George\u0027s Chapel (pictured          Prince Charles said today he was \u0027pleased to welcome her to the royal family in this way\u0027, Kensington Palace revealed in a shock statement that also suggested Meghan could enter the church alone and meet Charles half way          Charles is said to be very fond of Meghan (pictured together on Christmas Day at Sandringham) and was happy to help her after her father caused a crisis ahead of her wedding            Royal fans have mostly reacted positively to the news, speaking of their joy for Prince Charles, but others have also said Meghan should have asked her mother Doria Meghan\u0027s mother Doria (pictured left in LA) was expected to give her daughter away.

They were also unable to say when Prince Harry would meet his new father-in-law. Although the couple have been dating for two years, the prince has only ever spoken to him by phone.Yesterday\u0027s announcement came at the end of a truly remarkable few days, in which Kensington Palace was accused of failing to get a grip of the situation, leaving Thomas Markle to brief the US gossip website TMZ about his plans.  Even Buckingham Palace courtiers have started looking at the website for the latest updates.  But as the final preparations were put into place yesterday afternoon, Miss Markle and Harry appeared to be all smiles.The couple attended their last wedding rehearsal at St George\u0027s Chapel in Windsor with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and their children, Prince George and Princess Charlotte, who are page boy and bridesmaid. Miss Markle looked radiant despite the strain of the past week, wearing a white £285 Boss bodysuit and £7,000 Birks diamond earrings.Although the Queen arrived at Windsor Castle for the weekend while the wedding party was there, she is understood not to have taken part.Friends said last night that despite the drama of the past few days, Miss Markle was excited about the wedding and looking forward to exchanging vows with her prince. One admitted that families could sometimes be \u0027messy\u0027, but that she and Harry knew they had done everything possible to support her parents.\u0027They are just looking forward to the next few days and happy and excited about becoming man and wife,\u0027 the source said.

A police boat cruises the Thames in Windsor today as part of the £30m operation to keep the event secure            Sniffer dogs are checking the streets while police are checking drains and removing bins to stop any attack on the royal wedding          The Quire in St George\u0027s Chapel at Windsor Castle, where Prince Charles will walk Meghan Markle down the aisle tomorrowThe prince and Ms Markle\u0027s reception will be held in the castle\u0027s 180ft (55m) long St George\u0027s Hall, traditionally used for glittering state banquets.The vast hall had to be restored following the devastating fire at the castle in 1992.The chapel, with its intricately carved stonework, magnificent fan vaulted ceiling and beautiful stained glass windows, has seen many royal weddings and funerals.The last royal wedding was for Harry\u0027s cousin, Peter Phillips, son of the Princess Royal, who married Canadian Autumn Kelly in 2008.Harry\u0027s father and stepmother, the Duchess of Cornwall, had their televised religious blessing there in 2005, after their civil ceremony down the road in Windsor\u0027s Town Hall.In 1999, Harry\u0027s uncle, the Earl of Wessex, married Sophie Rhys-Jones, now the Countess of Wessex, at St George\u0027s.Royal newlyweds and their families traditionally pose for photographs afterwards on the vast west steps, as Harry and his new bride are certain to do.It has been the setting for many historic funerals including the Queen Mother\u0027s private committal service following her Westminster Abbey funeral in 2002, and in the same year, Princess Margaret\u0027s small, private funeral.The funeral of the Queen\u0027s father, King George VI, took place at St George\u0027s in 1952.Like Westminster Abbey, the chapel is known as a Royal Peculiar, with the Dean of Windsor responsible only to the sovereign.The church, a place of worship for the Queen and her family, is often at the heart of royal events, with the Windsors gathering there each year for Easter services, and in the past for occasions such as the service to mark the Duke of Edinburgh\u0027s 90th birthday.Within the chapel are the tombs of 10 sovereigns - as well as George VI, the remains of Edward IV, Henry VI, Henry VIII and his third wife Jane Seymour, the beheaded Charles I, George III, George IV, William IV, Edward VII and George V also rest there.                           \u0027Prince Charles doesn\u0027t have a daughter so he must be VERY happy\u0027: Social media overflows with praise for Meghan\u0027s \u0027touching\u0027 decision to ask her father-in-law to give her away... although feminists claim the decision is \u0027sexist\u0027Royal fans today spoke of their joy for Prince Charles after it was revealed he will step in for the father of the bride and walk Meghan Markle down the aisle.The Prince of Wales will give his soon-to-be daughter-in-law away when she marries Prince Harry tomorrow at St George\u0027s Chapel in Windsor Castle.Meghan, 36, asked her future father-in-law to accompany her on the way to the altar after her father Thomas Markle had to pull out following heart surgery.Responding to the announcement by Kensington Palace this morning, royal fans praised the \u0027fantastic\u0027 decision and said they were delighted for Charles.             Royal fans have mostly reacted positively to the news, speaking of their joy for Prince CharlesOne said: \u0027What a lovely thing. Charles himself has no biological daughters but he will definitely be gaining one tomorrow. It will be a very touching moment.\u0027Another from New South Wales, Australia, tweeted: \u0027What a wonderful blessing for them both. Something Charles thought he would never be able to do.\u0027Her mother may not have been comfortable doing this. Whatever the reason, it is fantastic. Many blessings and prayers for both Harry and Meghan.\u0027And a third said: \u0027I knew it would be Prince Charles. I was hoping for her mum to do it, but I guess she wanted to keep things as traditional as possible. Great choice!\u0027However, not everyone was happy with the announcement. Aimee Day tweeted: \u0027No, it should have been her mum to do it. She brought her up and she should do it.             Others are not so impressed by the decision, with some claiming it is a \u0027sexist\u0027 move\u0027In general I think the mother\u0027s should do it anyway. After all, in most situations the mother does everything for their child over the father - in my experience.\u0027And Rachel Douce added: \u0027Disappointing that Prince Charles is walking Meghan down the aisle. Perfect opportunity for the royals to show how modern and not sexist they are and let Doria do it, but no.\u0027Mr Markle was forced to pull out of performing the fatherly duty after undergoing heart surgery in a dramatic upset just two days before the wedding.The actress\u0027s mother Doria Ragland had been tipped to perform the role. But Harry\u0027s father is far more experienced at appearing at big public events amid scrutiny.Wedding-watchers camped outside Windsor Castle in readiness for the festivities said they felt her soon-to-be father-in-law stepping in was a \u0027nice gesture\u0027.The announcement from Kensington Palace on Friday morning came with just 24 hours to go until the big day, with final preparations well under way in Windsor. Windsor visitor Leslie Haynes, from Washington, said: \u0027I was surprised actually. I knew that Prince Charles was in the running. I just assumed it would be her mother.\u0027But it was Meghan\u0027s approval and choice and so we support that, and, as we say, the next King of England is going to walk her down the aisle.\u0027The 58-year-old, who is camping  opposite the castle, said she was \u0027somewhat\u0027 disappointed that Miss Ragland would not accompany Meghan to the altar.She added: \u0027But I have to say that it\u0027s her choice so we\u0027re happy for her. She is going to be the happiest woman in the world tomorrow so how could we be disappointed about that?\u0027Margaret Phipps, 25, from Texas, said: \u0027She has such a close relationship with her mum, so I think it is surprising to some people. But I think it\u0027s a nice gesture. \u0027He (Charles) doesn\u0027t have a daughter that he\u0027d ever be able to walk down the aisle. And it just sort of shows her transition into the royal family.\u0027She\u0027s really becoming a part of that family with him kind of acting as the father figure in situations, so I personally think it\u0027s nice.\u0027Sylvia Horn, 61, from Nashville, said it is \u0027wonderful\u0027, adding: \u0027It\u0027s usually a gentleman that does it.\u0027 \u0027I fully approve since Charles is going to be her father-in-law,\u0027 she said.  "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/18/00/4C61342200000578-0-image-m-21_1526601358781.jpg","title":"Kate Osamor caught plagiarising Barack Obamas acceptance speech","story":"Kate Osamor (pictured right) used a chunk of Barack Obama\u0027s speech to hail her own reelection to Edmonton in last year\u0027s election Ex Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith accuses EU of trying to...Share this articleShe said: \u0027If there is anyone out there who doubts that Edmonton is a place where all things are possible, who still wonders if the dream of hope is alive in our time, who still questions the power of our democracy, tonight is your answer.\u0027It\u0027s the answer told by the lines of people stretched around polling stations, schools and churches. \u0027By young people who queued, many for the first time in their lives because they believed that voting for Labour this time must be different, that their voices could be the difference.\u0027 The section is virtually identical to Mr Obama\u0027s speech in his hometown of Chicago after he was elected President for the first time.He told the crowd: \u0027If there is anyone out there who still doubts that America is a place where all things are possible, who still wonders if the dream of our founders is alive in our time, who still questions the power of our democracy, tonight is your answer.

Judge Lorien Kite called it “witty, wise and constantly surprising” and “a delicate, historically nuanced portrait of Britain in the age of Brexit”. Cordelia Fine’s Testosterone Rex, an examination of the science behind gender bias that won the 2017 Royal Society science book prize, was also picked for the shortlist, alongside Christopher de Bellaigue’s The Islamic Enlightenment, a history of reformations in Islamic countries during the 19th and 20th centuries. Mark Mazower is also shortlisted for his memoir about his family’s roots in Russia, What You Did Not Tell, alongside Darren McGarvey’s Poverty Safari, an investigation into Britain’s most deprived communities and Clair Wills’s Lovers and Strangers, a history of immigrants in Britain.Kite, a journalist for the Financial Times, said the six titles “together illustrate the vigour and variety of political writing in our tumultuous times”.“Brexit, immigration, revolution, gender, poverty, the Middle East – the dominant themes were always clear, but so too was the range of approaches deployed by this year’s Orwell prize entries. History, fiction, memoir and science are all represented in our shortlist, six titles that succeed in quite different ways,” said Kite, who is joined on the judging panel by the politician and academic Andrew Adonis, the literary journalist Alex Clark and the novelist Kit de Waal.The winner will be announced on 25 June, Orwell’s 115th birthday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc80e9ab23b3f9453bc65cd37d368fd322eafeea/0_2172_5726_3433/master/5726.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ccb1cfe0cc21325a996bb031269d4380","title":"smiggle laughing all the way to the bank after uk expansion","story":"Australian retailer with sights on kids’ pocket money has pursued aggressive expansion in the UK“I was in Smiggle and my mum said ‘I wish there were some chairs’ but other than that Smiggle is amazing,” is the professional assessment of the eight-year-old budding retail analyst Bridie O’Brien.Her father, Patrick, a retail expert at the GlobalData consultancy, had called on his daughter’s expertise as the London schoolgirl is exactly the target customer of the Australian chain that has taken the UK by storm over the last four years. While many other UK retailers are feeling the squeeze and shutting shops, Smiggle’s British sales nearly doubled to £56m last year and its profits surged from £3.3m to £10.8m, according to accounts filed this month. The retailer, best-known for its fluorescent notebooks and sweet-smelling pencils and rubbers, has pursued an aggressive store-opening plan since arriving on British shores in 2014. Earlier this month, Smiggle (where a smile meets a giggle) made its debut on Oxford Street in London with a two-storey tween temple twice the size of its other stores. “We try and be a wholesome alternative to the dreaded screen,” explains John Cheston, the retailer’s Melbourne-based managing director, who is in the UK for the high-profile store opening. “We get a lot of goodwill out of that.”Smiggle is after children’s pocket money with its sights trained on the stationery needs, scented or otherwise, of children aged five to 14. It’s a bigger market opportunity than you’d think, with Sheffield-born Cheston revealing that some children turn up at his shops in affluent Surrey with a crisp £50 note to spend. “It’s not unusual for kids to have pocket money of £20, £30, £40 a week,” he says. “We have some stores where kids get £50 a week and come in with a £50 note.”“One of the greatest things about our brand is that it transcends all demographics,” says the 51-year-old, who describes himself as a “northern kid who came from nothing”. “There’s the little girl who is at a private prep school, has got a horse and her parents are doing really well, and she loves Smiggle,” says Cheston. “At the other end there’s kids from broken homes, who see their parent every few weeks, and when asked what do you want to do? will say: ‘I’d like to go to McDonald’s for a happy meal, see the latest Pixar animated film and go to Smiggle’.”Cheston, who started his career with a traineeship at Marks \u0026amp Spencer, has masterminded the stationery brand’s assault on the cutthroat UK market. In doing so he has put to shame the efforts of his countrymen from Wesfarmers who have crashed and burned and had to write off £500m following their disastrous £340m acquisition of Homebase. Smiggle is one of several brands owned by Just Group, a subsidiary of Premier Investments, run by retail billionaire Solomon Lew. It is the only brand that Just Group has exported to the UK and its success comes at a time when many homegrown retailers, from Mothercare to New Look, Carpetright and House of Fraser are struggling.Cheston, who regularly clocks up 30,000 steps a day patrolling shopping centres and competitors’ stores, says: “We did a massive amount of reconnaissance before we committed to coming here.”Cheston reckoned it would get sales of $A200m (£111m) within five years, a plan expected to involve 200 store openings. It remains on track to hit that sales target, but with 130 stores in the bag and another dozen in the pipeline it may slow the pace of openings after being surprised by the success of its website. “Online blew us away because kids don’t have credit cards right?” says Cheston. The problems faced by other retailers mean there is downward pressure on retail rents. “If we wanted to get to 200 stores the deals in Grimsby or Wolverhampton would be a lot more compelling than a year ago, because of people shuttering stores,” he explains. “But if you are a brand that wants prime sites it’s harder. I don’t want to be the last man with the lights on when everyone else is walking away.”Despite her passion for Smiggle, Bridie O’Brien is not without criticism of the brand. In particular, she has an issue with some of the prices – £18 for pencil cases and £33 for a backpack, for example. “I think that they could bring the prices down,” she wrote. The frenzy around the brand in the early days, which Cheston likens to Beatlemania, has also been blamed for playground squabbles, with some teachers complaining its expensive novelty gear is distracting, leading to classroom bans – including at Bridie’s school. Cheston is undeterred: “I think anything that entices children to want to go to school is a good thing. There is a bigger issue with kids with mobile phones. “If the biggest problem in the world today is a scented pencil case and a pencil that changes colour then the world’s gone mad.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/446013b2d2bbf76ae9a2a5a09551c502369b63b6/0_0_4163_2498/master/4163.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ba933f6e47e93b4d9a2a7ee42517d4a6","title":"im worth more than what i put on my face","story":"Cook, food stylist and writer  Anna Jones reflects on how she discovered a signature look to suit her work and family worldsCook, food stylist and writer  Anna Jones reflects on how she discovered a signature look to suit her work and family worldsIn my life, I’ve inhabited many different worlds. I’ve been through phases of dressing like a goth, a hippy and a really girly girl. As a student, I read economics and philosophy, then worked for a PR company where everyone dressed in suits. Then, after reading an article that said you should follow your passion according to which part of the newspaper you read first, I pivoted into a career in food with an apprenticeship at Jamie Oliver’s Fifteen restaurant. I’ve worked hot shifts in busy kitchens, and now I spend my time testing recipes, going on food photoshoots and writing about cooking, alongside looking after my two-year-old son at home. But through it all, I’ve kept a very consistent look. I’ve always admired women who reinvent themselves dramatically, but that’s just never been my way. Happily, I’ve always been content in my own skin and I put that down to my mum.Looking back on myself as a little girl, I was so pretty and sweet but I didn’t always feel it. I wore glasses, which I hated, so I ditched them for contact lenses as soon as I could. However, at quite a young age I realised that despite what I looked like, my value came from my inside not my outside. That discovery was thanks to Mum. She really instilled in my sister, Laura, and me that makeup was there for us to use if we wanted it, but that it wasn’t something we should put on for anyone beyond ourselves. As a teenager I would play around with pink pearlescent lipsticks and questionable eyeshadows and it was always a fun part of dressing up – it never felt essential. As a proud feminist, Mum has only ever dressed for herself, and is naturally very beautiful. She has the most vibrant, glowing skin and has never worn a scrap of foundation. I carry her belief inside me, which is that I’m worth more than what I put on my face.Following my apprenticeship, I worked in restaurant kitchens in London and around the world. I’d swapped the corporate world of heels and power suits for a predominantly male environment. I’d still wear makeup in the kitchen but not too much – opening an oven door, for instance, can melt off your mascara. I’d wear chef’s whites, made for men, with my hair scraped back. The chef’s outfit was defeminising and sometimes that was useful, especially on the occasions where I’d have to bring out my inner alpha female. But I also wanted to feel like a woman – and to feel like myself – and a little makeup helped me mark myself out from the boys, even if it was just a lick of mascara, some blusher and a dot of concealer.When I left the kitchens to work for Jamie Oliver on his food team, helping him to write recipes, make his TV shows and make his food look good in pictures, I was introduced to a whole new world of photoshoots, lights and cameras.And, thanks to my work, I’ve had my eyes opened to the fact that there’s more than just one makeup setting – it doesn’t have to always be a natural base and a flick of eyeliner.This was brought home to me in the run up to my wedding, two years ago. John and I married in a beautiful church on an island in north Wales. It was an idyllic setting but I wasn’t sure I’d be able to get a makeup artist to take the trip, so my dear friend Ceri bought me a three-hour makeup lesson in London with an amazing woman called Sasha, so that I could do my own on the day. It was fantastic and so much better than watching a YouTube tutorial. Obviously I don’t often recreate the look I wore on my wedding day (although it was very natural), but thanks to that lesson, I have a few different “faces” that I can bring out, depending on the occasion. And while I’m often happy to embrace the day bare-faced, I do have a go-to look that suits me most days. Having never been a morning person – and now with my son Dylan, two, to look after – I can do the whole thing in seven minutes: light foundation, cream concealer, bronzer, peachy blusher, eyelash curlers, mascara and a smear of lip balm. I’ve done it on the tube and in the back of a taxi.There’s a definite synergy that connects the way I look and the ethos behind my style of cooking. My recipes are full of fresh, vibrant, earthy flavours and that’s reflected in how I present myself. I like clothes made from natural fabrics that feel good on my skin in colours that reflect nature – my love of things that come from the earth pervades every aspect of my life. With the food I make, I try to put joy at the centre of every plate, and that’s how I approach getting ready in the morning. Those seven minutes are probably the only time I spend on myself during the whole day. It’s a ritual that helps me to feel bright and ready to face the day.Photography: Brian Daly and Louisa Parry"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b6971c15c879f14c2a7893db9d5453e1942a384e/0_7_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=918caeb76c8be80094d523559d13c250","title":"children stressed social media parents","story":"Poor Twiglet the dog. Her short-lived career as a comfort animal for anxious Cambridge university students ended prematurely this week, after unprecedented demand to take her out for soothing walks left her feeling rather overanxious herself. At her peak, the jack russell was being booked out for eight hours a day, which says something about stress levels approaching finals.We are now well into education’s annual slough of despond: primary school Sats finished this week GCSEs have just begun A-levels and finals are next. Exams have always been, and will always be, stressful. What’s new is the cliff-edge feeling surrounding them: a paralysing fear of failure, combined with an ever-rising threshold for success that leaves too many children convinced it would be the end of the world to slip a grade.It’s tough even for resilient kids, but for those who are already prone to anxiety it’s hellish.Primary school teachers are having to reassure 10- and 11-year-olds that their futures won’t be irrevocably decided by Sats, which were only ever intended as a test of schools and not of children. Secondary school teachers describe panic attacks, children crying in class, and a rampaging anxiety among GCSE students who are once again guinea pigs in some education secretary’s politically driven experiment. This time, it’s Michael Gove’s legacy to the nation: super-rigorous “gold standard” exams. No more coursework, and a new numbered grading system that replaces the old A and A* – already beyond most kids’ reach – with new grades 7, 8 and 9. The line between 8 and 9 must be so fine now as to be irrelevant to almost all employers – yet the most perfectionist, anxious, overachieving kids (not to mention the most ambitious parents) will feel it matters and those are precisely the kids to worry about.Meanwhile the fear of failure that drives some to revise until 1am is also, in a different way, driving the kids who switch off school entirely because they know they can’t do this. And all to what end, exactly? Who is really rooting for this new academic Hunger Games, beyond people who took their own O-levels so long ago they’ve no idea what it’s like now?We are told it’s to prepare kids for an increasingly competitive world. But it’s unclear how early failure to master JB Priestley’s An Inspector Calls on the one hand, or risking burnout for a 9 grade on the other, relates to the problems kids will face on leaving school: fewer good jobs available for the less academically able, as routine work is increasingly automated and casualised, plus uncertainty over Brexit and an economy past its productive peak that isn’t yet sure where the next one’s coming from.Too many kids, meanwhile, are perfectly aware even from primary school of what they’re supposedly up against. Even getting a degree no longer feels like enough in an increasingly competitive workplace, so the pressure students put themselves under to get firsts has increased exponentially. Speculation that an increase in students getting firsts must be down to grade inflation, or universities trying to please their now-paying customers, wilfully ignores the fact that these kids are visibly pushing themselves harder than their predecessors – and not just academically. Every holiday is stuffed with high-octane work experience and CV-building activities. When I went back to my old college recently, half of the bar had been turned into a coffee area: they don’t loll around boozing like we did but bring their laptops in and work. Oh, and there’s now a dedicated mental health nurse.Having seen too many contemporaries realise only in their 30s that the anxiety they’d struggled with for years wasn’t normal, I wonder if in part we’re just more open now to seeing and treating problems that were perhaps always there in teenagers, and that’s a good thing. (An estimated one in 10 children now have clinically diagnosable mental health disorders, but that’s the same rate as in 1999.) The sharp rise in mental health referrals by schools suggests they’re spotting problems earlier, although unfortunately the services to which these kids are referred are stretched to breaking point.The new courses have a greater emphasis on final exam marks, with little or no coursework counting towards final grades, and a new grading scheme running from 9 at the top to 1 as the lowest rank.The new system sets a 4 as equivalent to a C under the previous rankings, while the top grades A* and A will be split into three grades, 7, 8 and 9 – with 9 awarded to those with marks at the top of the old A* grade.Ofqual’s chief regulator said the new courses allowed students to more fully display their abilities and knowledge, and would help them go on to further study. “In turn, the new 9 to 1 grade system signals to employers and others that this year’s students have studied new, more challenging content, and better differentiates between their achievements,” she said.“Putting more emphasis on final exams is hitting hardest those who require the most support, such as disadvantaged students and students with special education need,” said Kevin Courtney, the union’s general secretary.We’re probably also more alert to those teenagers who wouldn’t necessarily reach a diagnostic threshold but are still significantly unhappier than anyone wants a child to be: anxious, fragile, struggling to cope. These kids may need professional help managing their feelings, but we should also be asking why so many of them are suddenly having such feelings.While the young people we should be most worried about are the ones struggling even to leave their rooms, rather than the ones queuing up to walk the comfort dog, even the latter may be more stressed than a 20-year-old should be, or even used to be, and they’re telling us something about the world we as adults have created for them.What could we do differently? For a start, parents need to beware projecting their own anxieties on to kids who aren’t mature enough to handle them. Social media companies could stop kicking and squealing every time someone suggests limiting children’s access to their addictive, feel-bad platforms, which only intensify teenagers’ emotional ups and downs. Child and adolescent mental health services must be properly funded to meet rising demand, and backed up by pastoral measures in schools and universities to build emotional resilience – which includes learning to bounce back from life’s inevitable setbacks.Governments of all colours, meanwhile, have to learn to stop fiddling pointlessly with exams. No more tearing up syllabuses, marking schemes or grade boundaries for the sake of a headline give teachers time to absorb one set of changes before leaping into the next and focus instead on building an economy where getting a decent job doesn’t feel like a game of musical chairs in which too many chairs are snatched away. That’s a far harder test for politicians, obviously. Some might even call it a “gold standard”. But we are heaping too much pressure on small shoulders. It’s time adults started to lighten the load."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ead0ea54c143e5cbe920a3ba82e051ea087d157/0_161_3649_2189/master/3649.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e49ba60c1fbbd99a908049fb6c050195","title":"middle aged women invisible on screen campaign acting casting","story":"Like most of us I love a good TV drama, which is why I sat down to watch both The City and the City and Deep State recently. But this time irritation spoiled my enjoyment. The lead actors of both British series, in their middle 50s, were cast against female lead actors as romantic partners, both in their 30s.Once you see this, it’s hard to unsee it. So I reflected on other forms of entertainment. Saturday-night TV gave me a range of shows with men in middle age, and older and female co-presenters who weren’t, or who certainly looked like they weren’t, much older than 35. Or take film: I love to watch Tom Cruise, but the really impossible mission seems to be to star with a female actor his own age. The latest Mission Impossible film sees the 55-year-old paired with 34-year-old Rebecca Ferguson, which sends a message to me that men in middle age are still capable and vibrant, energetic and passionate, whereas middle-aged women are redundant.In a sample of 12 cinema releases this month, there are nine lead actresses in the 19-to-30 age range, but only three films with female leads over the age of 40. Their male co-stars aren’t bound by this formula. Why is it that our middle-aged male screen heroes seem unable to contemplate a relationship with a woman of their own age?I’m 51 and my husband is 49. All our friends are similar ages and with similarly aged partners. But in the world of TV, middle-aged women like me are often absent. On TV, if you’re a woman every year over 40 seems to count for five years.Two years ago, I set myself a challenge: to relaunch my acting career, which I’d shelved very early on for my parental and filial caring responsibilities, looking after two daughters with disabilities and a mother diagnosed with Alzheimer’s. Two decades on, I had no idea how difficult this second attempt as a performer would prove to be, but in an industry dominated by youth – and where old for women is 35 – the ageism is shockingly blatant.So today, with the recent words of the actor Frances McDormand about the inclusivity rider on film contracts featuring prominently in my thoughts, I am launching a new campaign: Acting Your Age . I’m calling on writers, commissioners, directors and performers to embrace a generation of invisible women.I don’t want the wonderful Sarah Lancashire, star of Happy Valley, to be the only exception to a British rule – or for the age-appropriate casting of Olivia Colman in The Crown to be a rarity. I don’t want Reese Witherspoon and Nicole Kidman to have to fight tooth and nail to get a series such as Big Little Lies made. I want these to be the normal way of things for middle-aged women, just as they are for middle-aged men.Of course, the marginalisation of middle-aged women is not limited to acting – as the deputy governor of the Bank of England, Ben Broadbent, showed this week when he referred to a “menopausal economy”, older women are portrayed negatively in all walks of life. But perhaps if we achieved visibility on the influencers that are TV and film, we might be deemed to exist across the board. Isn’t it time to end the notion that the advent of a woman’s wrinkles and grey hair means she can no longer pay her mortgage through acting?• Nicola Clark is a writer, campaigner and performer"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b6a97d99d5e479c83c6835d20c3f4bb977126b76/0_0_2848_1709/master/2848.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6f47d5b5bee58113d28bf88138bebacb","title":"the week in wildlife in pictures","story":"Sea otters, an African forest elephant and endangered Francois’ langurs are among this week’s pick of images from the natural world"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/52e01f051ba84f762c4fd096f796205944858b49/1368_1239_2324_1394/master/2324.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4216b910d27241db1de4c31a6f3b7795","title":"what wore week pinafore dress jess cartner morley","story":"Feel weird in dungarees? Try a pinafore dress insteadGather round, my friends. My years spent overthinking clothes have been rewarded with a\u0026nbspfew nuggets of genuinely useful wisdom, and I\u0026nbspam about to share one of them with you. Ready?Here’s the thing. When your desire to wear an item of clothing is driven by wanting to look the way one specific person looks in that item of clothing – and that one specific person looks nothing like you – stop right there. Take a step back from the checkout. Close down the online shopping tab. It just doesn’t work.You see, in an ideal world I would look like Jane\u0026nbspBirkin in blue jeans and a white T-shirt. But I\u0026nbspdon’t look anything like Jane Birkin, and not even the perfect jeans nor the ultimate T-shirt will change that. Same goes for looking like Naomi Campbell in a bikini. The best swimwear in the world will get me precisely nowhere on that front. See?Anyway, I have this thing with dungarees. In the aforementioned ideal world, I would look like Alexa Chung in dungarees. With, like, a\u0026nbspmessy bob and cool trainers. So into that look. But I don’t look like Alexa Chung, and therefore I won’t look like Alexa Chung in dungarees, I\u0026nbspwill look like me in dungarees, which is less style-icon-playing-down-her-intimidating-beauty-in-utilitarian-workwear than fashion-editor-dressed-as-children’s-TV-presenter. So. No dungarees for me.The good news for those of us who are not Alexa Chung, in or out of dungarees, is that pinafore dresses are now a thing. Pinafore dresses have the breezy, nonchalant aesthetic that I like about dungarees minus the vaguely comic crotch area and the terrifying back view.However, even at my high level of enthusiasm, I\u0026nbspdon’t think the pinafore is a piece you are going to want to buy several of, so I suggest you look for one in a more grownup fabric than denim, and then you can wear it to work as well as at the weekend, without looking like you belong on the railroad. You want something weighty, so it doesn’t crease badly when you sit. Crepe or wool, maybe, or I am really rather taken with the Kitri dress I am wearing here. A pinafore works well with a smart silk blouse, or a fine-knit sweater. Sleeves to the elbow or longer will look more elegant than T-shirt-length or cap sleeves.You know who you will look a tiny bit like? You.

The whisky bottles, which had not been seen in public since they were last auctioned three decades ago, are described as the “holy grail of Macallan” because only 24 bottles were produced as gifts for the distillery’s most-valued customers. The bottles feature specially commissioned labels by the pop artists Valerio Adami, which sold for $1.1m (£814,000), and Sir Peter Blake, which sold for just over $1m. The Blake-designed bottle sold to a telephone bidder and the Adami-designed bottle was sold to a bidder in the room at Bonhams auction house in Hong Kong. The record sale price works out at £1,080 per millilitre of whisky. Both bidders were undisclosed.The previous whisky sale price record was set in 2017 with the £730,000 sale of a six-bottle lot of Macallan. The previous record for a single bottle was the £466,000 paid for a Macallan M Imperiale in 2014, although an Imperiale contains eight and a half 70cl bottles worth of whisky. Daniel Lam, Bonhams’ head of fine wine and whisky in Hong Kong, said: “These two bottles are the most significant whiskies ever produced in 20th century and truly presented a once-in-a-generation opportunity for collectors to acquire the holy grail of Macallan.“Active bidding came in from around the world but we saw new bidders from South-east Asia, including Vietnam, Thailand and Malaysia, reflecting the growing appetite and appreciation for whisky among Asian collectors.”The whisky, which was bottled in 1986, is presented in specially commissioned cabinets or Tantaluses, based on the traditional ‘brass and glass’ distillery spirit safe. Blake is best known for co-creating the Beatles’ album cover of Sgt Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club band in 1967, which was voted by Rolling Stone magazine as the No 1 album of all time. Adami is an Italian artist famous for painting bold, flat forms outlined in thick, black lines, in a style reminiscent of comic art.

May’s other nominees are Diana Barran, Catherine Meyer, the founder of Action Against Abduction who is married to former US ambassador Sir Christopher Meyer, and Amanda Sater, a former party deputy chair.The nominations will tilt the balance of the chamber slightly in favour of May, taking her party’s total of peers from 244 to 253. But no party has a majority in the 780-strong upper house, and the government has been so heavily defeated on some amendments that introducing a handful of more supportive peers will only make a modest difference in getting Brexit through parliament.The DUP will nominate the former MP William McCrea, who has been criticised for sharing a platform in the past with Billy Wright, a loyalist paramilitary. Only McCrea’s name emerged, despite rumours that the DUP was initially offered at least one other nomination.Labour was granted three nominations, and Jeremy Corbyn put forward the former party general secretary Iain McNicol and the race equality campaigner Martha Osamor, the mother of the MP Kate Osamor, as had been expected. The third nominee is Pauline Bryan, a Scottish campaigner and editor of What Would Keir Hardie Say?, a collection of essays once given by Corbyn to Barack Obama.The proposed elevation of Osamor was immediately criticised by a Jewish campaign group after it emerged that she was one of several signatories to a 2016 letter complaining about the suspension of Ken Livingstone and others over antisemitism. Arguing that the suspensions were McCarthyite, the letter said the charges of antisemitism were being used to “silence criticisms of Israel … and undermine Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn”.Gideon Falter, the chair of the Campaign Against Antisemitism, said that elevating Osamor was a “two-fingered salute” to the Jewish community, and that Corbyn’s decision was “telling us not only that he sees her behaviour as unproblematic, but that he sees it as being worthy of the highest honour and a lifelong seat in the House of Lords”.Political peers are nominated periodically at the initiation of Downing Street in a behind-the-scenes haggling process, which in this case began in November, and starts with a debate about how many each party is granted. Names are suggested informally and canvassed before the House of Lords appointments commission to see if they meet the appropriate financial and legal standards before finally being formally submitted.The Liberal Democrats did not make any nominations, although it is well represented in the chamber with 98 peers. Dick Newby, the party’s leader in the Lords, said: “This is a cynical response from Theresa May to losing a string of votes in the Lords in recent weeks.”Lilley, a Thatcherite who has long been a Eurosceptic, was Margaret Thatcher’s trade secretary and then social security secretary in John Major’s government. At the 1992 party conference he sang about his “little list” of benefit fraudsters and was an energetic promoter of the idea that many people on social security were scroungers."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d0983f3f3bdfd0334154d8c41fc1f2333f9da823/0_0_3062_1837/master/3062.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=822aaf2b14e96304582572ace29afe4a","title":"theresa may john bercow andrea leadsom alleged stupid woman remarks unacceptable","story":"Theresa May’s spokesman says ‘unacceptable’ comment must be looked at if complaint madeTheresa May has said there should be an investigation if a complaint is made over allegations that John Bercow, the House of Commons Speaker, called Andrea Leadsom a “stupid woman” in heated exchanges after prime minister’s questions.The prime minister’s spokesman said: “We’ve seen the alleged remarks and clearly the prime minister thinks they are unacceptable. And if an official complaint is made, it should be properly investigated.”But MPs have said the Commons system of investigation is too flawed to do an effective job. Although any complaint can trigger an investigation by the parliamentary standards commissioner, Kathryn Stone, her report has to be submitted to the committee on standards.On Tuesday, MPs on the committee blocked an inquiry into historical allegations of bullying by Bercow by three votes to two. The committee is unique because it has lay members, but they do not have a vote. It is understood these members unanimously supported an investigation. Leadsom, the leader of the Commons, has been spearheading work to improve the system for reporting and investigating complaints. She is said to believe the committee’s decision underlines the need to revoke MPs’ power to decide on sanctions.In the Commons on Wednesday, Bercow was overheard swearing under his breath after he criticised Leadsom for arranging government statements that took up time intended for a Labour debate on Grenfell. An opposition MP told Leadsom what they had heard. She is understood not to want to raise a complaint personally and so far no one has lodged a complaint with the standards commissioner. If a complaint were lodged, it is thought this could allow Stone to investigate the historical allegations of bullying, despite the committee’s move to block it.The Speaker’s office did not deny that Bercow made the remark. “Strong and differing views” had been expressed in the chamber on an “unusual and controversial day”, it said, adding: “The Speaker treats his colleagues with respect and strives at every turn to facilitate the House of Commons.”The historical allegations of bullying were made earlier this year in a BBC Newsnight investigation. They involved two senior members of Commons staff, who had each been Bercow’s private secretary after he was elected Speaker.Kate Emms allegedly developed post-traumatic stress disorder after working for him, and Angus Sinclair took compulsory early retirement. He said Bercow had demeaned and physically intimidated him, once smashing a mobile phone on his desk. Later, another former senior parliamentary figure, David Leakey, criticised Bercow. Bercow has emphatically denied allegations that he bullied Sinclair and Emms.The allegations emerged after Leadsom had finished her inquiry into overhauling the complaints system in the Commons. She has made no secret of the fact that she wanted the committee set up to investigate complaints to be given the power to examine recent allegations about past incidents.Caroline Lucas, the Green party MP who was on the committee and is part of the steering group overseeing reform, said: “If there isn’t urgent reform to the standards committee there will be a massive outcry.“For as long as MPs are both judge and jury we are never going to have a fair and independent complaints system – it urgently needs to change so there is a proper way to deal with allegations of this nature. otherwise we are letting down Commons staff and ending up with trial by media which risks wronging everyone.” Bercow, a former Conservative MP, has had an increasingly stormy relationship with MPs and ministers, mainly those on the Tory side of the house, since he was elected in 2009.James Duddridge, one of his most outspoken critics, challenged Labour MPs over their support for Bercow. “Labour can’t pretend to be a decent party that cares about issues of sexism and bullying and procedure while supporting him, even if he is a pain for the government and helpful to them,” he said. “There’s a bigger picture here. He’s normalising bullying.”Bercow’s detractors feel he is immune to criticism because of the unique authority of his office. The Speaker is the champion of backbenchers, and of the principle of government accountability to the Commons."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/426372472b14a4edaf6fded898c687ba30b56d52/124_951_4724_2835/master/4724.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bd7b74e66e2ea65b28f7dc1e63b7c705","title":"neuroscientist hannah critchlow cambridge consciousness funny word","story":"On any given day in Cambridge, you may see numerous people jogging along the towpaths, and it’s not unreasonable to assume neuroscientists may be over-represented. “You see so many,” says Hannah Critchlow, a neuroscientist who likes to jog along the river. Physical fitness may be a secondary consideration, she says what they are really trying to do is ramp up their neurogenesis – the birth of new nerve cells in the brain.We are sitting in her study at Magdalene College, Cambridge, where Critchlow is outreach fellow, tasked with public engagement. Once described by the  as “a sort of female Brian Cox”, she has given numerous talks, been a presenter on Tomorrow’s World Live, the interactive version of the BBC science show, appeared on TV, radio and podcasts and was named as a top 100 scientist for her work in science communication. She has just written a book on consciousness – part of the Ladybird Expert series aimed at adults, a brief but mindbending introduction to the brain and the idea of consciousness, taking in philosophy, famous neuroscience breakthroughs and brain facts.“Our brain contains around 86bn nerve cells,” she writes. “To scale it down to something more palatable, if we took a dot of brain tissue the size of a sugar grain, it would contain roughly 10,000 nerve cells. Even more incredible: each of these nerve cells connects to around 10,000 others, forming the most densely packed and complicated circuit board imaginable.”She also writes about smart drugs, such as those prescribed for ADHD, that increase focus (she has said in the past that they are a problem among both students and academic staff). Does she still think that? Yes, she says. “First of all, people are buying these over the internet so they have no idea what they’re actually getting. And they’re taking them at doses that aren’t maybe optimum for that person’s chemistry. We don’t know what the long-term effects are, particularly on the developing brain. The brain is undergoing a huge amount of plasticity until the mid-20s, so I think it’s a terrible idea to take any kind of mind-altering drug until you’ve passed your mid-20s. I think it’s a really worrying issue and a potential timebomb.”She has started writing another book, based around the idea of free will. “There’s quite a lot of evidence to show it’s largely an illusion,” she says. “There’s a huge amount that seems to be hardwired into us and predetermined. You are born with a particular brain and that shapes your perception, shapes what you are hardwired to find rewarding. You are brought up in a particular environment and that reinforces what you are born with.” What does that mean for decision-making? “If your perception of the world is based on prior experiences and hardwiring, then that shapes your reality, which goes on to affect your decision-making. A large amount of your decision-making taps into your reward system in your brain. Although there is scope to change certain behaviours, you have to make a real conscious effort in order to break habits and change how your reward system affects your motivation. I think neuroscience can be very empowering in that, in making me go for a jog rather than reach for a bottle of shiraz.”Surely there is a danger in being a neuroscientist, running injuries aside, that you can start to view people as simply a bunch of chemical and electrical reactions. “I haven’t got to that point, yet,” says Critchlow. “I hope I never do.” But isn’t that what neuroscience is basically saying we are? “Yeah, but it’s an awe-inspiring, highly sophisticated, highly dynamic system that is incredible and beautiful in its intricacy. There are some gorgeous videos of new connections taking place in living, moving mammals as they’re moving around, going around a maze, for example. It’s incredible that our brain, as we are navigating the space around us – or in this case, the mouse – changes shape. You can see consciousness happen, new connections forming.”Demystifying the brain’s connections doesn’t reduce its magic, she says. “We each have such unique takes on the world. And then – and this is where I think it gets really interesting – our brains have these flaws, which means we make assumptions or we get things a little bit wrong, so our reality is not quite right. If we then discuss reality with another person who has another perspective, then we’re more likely to get a common understanding and appreciation of the world and it will become closer to reality.” But aren’t we living in polarised times, where nuance is out and it is impossible to find common ground with someone who believes the exact opposite? She thinks that ideas sharing through social-media technology is in its “toddler-tantrum” infancy and hopes we will be able to “exchange ideas in a more positive way”.“Hopefully the educational system will catch up and help people to evaluate whether they trust a particular source or not. That’s a skill that needs to be fostered from a young age.”The thing Critchlow most remembers about science lessons at school was being sent out of class for talking. She thought she might want to study medicine, but while working as a nursing assistant at a psychiatric hospital, she became fascinated by how the brain worked. “The medication and therapies on offer weren’t really doing anything other than making a lot of the patients almost catatonic. People would lose their cognitive capacity and potential to have joy from life.”After a degree in biology at Brunel University, she studied for a PhD at Cambridge. Her experience informs her work now as outreach fellow – she goes to state secondary schools and colleges to give talks about neuroscience, but also about the possibility of higher education and the Oxbridge admissions process. For state school intake, Cambridge is ranked fifth worst (Oxford is fourth). While Critchlow can’t talk about the prejudice that may lurk within the admissions system, she says perception from students is one problem. “I went to a state school and when I was thinking of applying to university, there was no chance that I’d have thought about applying to Cambridge. I came here for my PhD but that was because, at that point, I’d gained enough confidence. It’s maybe the perception of Oxford and Cambridge being elite universities and maybe students not having the confidence to apply, or not knowing much about the application process.”Is sexism a problem? When she was working on her PhD, a decade or so ago, she was giving a talk and one of the professors told her he couldn’t concentrate because when she was pointing to the data, her top was riding up slightly, exposing a “really small amount of my midriff. Apparently it was too distracting and he couldn’t concentrate on any of my data. I was pretty pissed off about that. You don’t imagine a male student gets those kind of comments.” People are much more aware now, she says. “I think there is still a bit of bias, but it’s been acknowledged.”It’s a particularly fascinating time to be a neuroscientist, she says, because society is having discussions about consciousness, artificial intelligence and what it means to be human. The question of consciousness has plagued neuroscientists and philosophers for centuries. What is Critchlow’s definition? “I think consciousness is a really funny word, and as we learn more about how the brain works, I think it is going to become even more difficult to give a succinct definition. Generally speaking, it has been agreed that consciousness is the ability to form a subjective view of the world, to have a unique view.”She says that in the future, we will probably be appalled at the way we treat animals now as we learn more about their brains and consciousness, but she’s also interested in the idea plants can be “conscious”. In her book, she writes about plants using electrical signals to send information around their “bodies”, and responding to their environments. She gives the example of a caterpillar eating a leaf: “The plant will start to produce a chemical to repel the insect. Even if the plant is simply played an audio file of a munching caterpillar, it will respond, indicating that plants can hear.”“So what do we eat?” says Critchlow. “Where do we draw a line? It’s starting to force us into this position where we have to ask ourselves maybe we don’t have this sovereignty over nature that we’ve always led ourselves to believe.”Can AI be considered to be conscious? “As we discover more about the neural networks and connections in the brain that allow us to learn and remember and form a subjective view of the world, we are starting to be able to use that information and emulate it in artificial intelligence systems. They can learn and remember without being coded to process information in the way we have told them to. So using that definition, yes, we’ll be able to develop AI that has some semblance of consciousness. But it’s a funny word. It’s almost as if humans have developed this word to make ourselves seem more important than we are.”Should robots have rights? She thinks for a while. “I’m not sure what the point would be. I think it’s going to be interesting to see how it all develops, to see the implications as AI evolves, what kind of rights should they have and what kind of limits should they have. I don’t think there’s a set answer. We don’t have a full handle on AI.”She caused a bit of a stir at the Hay festival in 2015 when she said it would be possible to download someone’s brain on to a computer – it seems less remarkable now that there are companies working on this, although in the face of much scepticism from the neuroscience community. “It’s a possibility, but I think there are a lot of things that are possibilities,” she says. “There are scientists that are working on taking a snapshot of the connectome, the 100tn or so connections in the brain, mapping those connections on a computer. So does that mean you can upload your brain if you have a snapshot of it at one particular time? Or if we have enough information could you then run simulations to see how the brain would evolve? We probably will get there at some point in the future.”Critchlow says she’s not keen on the idea for herself, although she is planning to donate her body to scientific research. “I don’t think it would be me. A simulation of me. This would just be a copy of me, of my connections.” Besides, she says, she thinks her simulation might still miss tangible, physical pleasures that come from being attached to a body. Such as gnocchi. It makes me laugh because it’s so specific, and not what I was expecting her to say – wine, perhaps, or running. But it’s lunchtime and she’s hungry (and she really loves gnocchi). Or at least her hypothalamus is telling her she is."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d694784ab0bad9393813ce6c5cc0301d8cfed203/0_53_2920_1752/master/2920.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=afea395738bbd31f70cbe757ab8ec631","title":"weatherwatch lightning conductors pointed or blunt st brides fleet street","story":"When St Bride’s church was damaged by lightning in 1764 George III contacted Benjamin Franklin for advice.

The top of Christopher Wren’s tallest spire came crashing down - losing the top 2.5 metres (8 ft) of its total 71-metre (234 ft) height.George III, who had an interest in scientific matters, wrote to Benjamin Franklin in America for advice. Franklin, a decade earlier, had invented the lightning conductor after working out that lightning was electricity. The King was advised that a metal rod fastened to the highest point of St Bride’s spire and attached to a thick band of metal would lead the electric charge from any future strikes safely to the ground without harming the building. But there was a dispute between the two men that became a political issue. Franklin favoured a pointed lightning conductor and the King, with advice from the Royal Society, thought a blunt tip would be best. In fact he ordered a cannon ball to top all conductors used anywhere in the British Empire. For the next 250 years American conductors were pointed and British ones blunt until experiments this century finally proved that blunt versions were better at attracting lightning.

Coincidentally, 1998 was also the year the iconic Angel of the North sculpture, designed by Antony Gormley, was erected in Gateshead. Both were towering achievements but, for a long time, just one of them seemed to have been built to last.Only now are Newcastle Falcons beginning to stretch their muscular arms once again, guided by a man who has had an even more tumultuous couple of decades. As it happens Dean Richards also made his first foray into management with Leicester in 1998, taking over from Bob Dwyer, and subsequently leading them to four Premiership titles and two European Cups in four seasons. Dragging Newcastle up from the league’s nether regions on a modest budget has, in its own way, been equally impressive.The north-east will love him even more if the Falcons can beat Exeter at Sandy Park on Saturday and bring some northern soul to the Twickenham grand final next week. It will be a tall order but Richards, freshly crowned as the Premiership’s director of rugby of the season for the first time in 17 years, has never been a guru who believes in the obvious.“There’s a joke going round that if you ever see Dean out on the field in his tracksuit with a whistle in his mouth take a photo because it’ll be worth an absolute fortune,” says the\u0026nbspFalcons’ managing director, Mick\u0026nbspHogan. “In terms of rarity value it’s probably as priceless as a\u0026nbspVan\u0026nbspGogh.”More commonplace, according to\u0026nbspHogan, is the sight of the 54‑year‑old former England No\u0026nbsp8 bobbing around in the North Sea rather than poring over match DVDs on his days off. “You’ll find him out at sea on his boat fishing. You’d think it must be a bloody strong boat, maybe some sort of decommissioned minesweeper, but\u0026nbspapparently it’s a tiny little wooden thing. He loves the\u0026nbspoutdoor\u0026nbsplife and you get that in the north-east.”In the same breath, though, Hogan will tell you why Richards has been pivotal to Newcastle’s steady rise since the club signed him in 2012 while he was still in the final months of a three-year ban following the infamous Bloodgate scandal. If moving to the north-east has helped to restore his reputation, he has done the same for the Falcons.“He is absolutely central to it all,” says Hogan. “To me there are two areas where he’s particularly good. Number one: he’s the best recruiter in the game. It’s not just about finding unknowns or signing Niki Goneva ... he gets it right at both ends of the spectrum.“We plucked Tane Takulua from absolutely nowhere and I’d put him up there with any scrum-half in the league now. The other bit he gets is the importance of the academy. It’s very easy for the guy at the top to look week to week because they’re judged on results. Not many are looking at the 16- or 17-year-olds and wondering: ‘Are they going to come good in five years’ time?’ Dean does.”Players of all vintages also relish his occasionally left-field methods. The former England captain Martin Corry, for example, still remembers the instant effect Richards had in his initial months at Leicester. “The transformation was remarkable. He felt the steeliness had gone out of the pack so he and John Wells announced they were going to start mauling against us at training. He always won.”Then there were the off-field bonding initiatives. “When he first took over at Leicester he realised the spirit wasn’t what it should have been,” says Corry.“He got us all in to a function room and said: ‘Tell your wives and girlfriends you’re going to be here for two hours.’ He then paired up one back and one forward for a three-legged race around every bar in Welford Road, with the first pair back the winner. I think there were 16 bars and you had to have a drink in each of them.”Some old-school habits have endured. Newcastle’s Scotland back-rower Ally Hogg, now in his last days before retirement, has spent eight years with the Falcons and recalls the club’s first big away win in Bristol under Richards after being relegated to the Championship. “We\u0026nbspbeat them down there and within five minutes we’d stopped at an off-licence and Dean was in buying beers for all the boys for the bus trip home. That was his thing: you had to make sure you bought your opposite number a pint after the game and on every away trip you’d have a few beers to bring everyone together. He has that old‑school mentality, which I think is key to building a good culture.”According to Corry, that could just be Richards’s most enduring quality. “What makes Deano great is that he’s adaptable. You’d never think he would move with the times, that he’d be the same old Deano, but he’s always managed to stay on top of the game. Look at how he’s come back from what happened at Harlequins. What he’s done at Newcastle is probably more impressive than what he did at Leicester. Yes there are plenty of anecdotes about him, but I think what he’s doing transcends that. You want to play for Dean, the club and your mates. It’s not just painting by numbers.”If signing good players and persuading them to perform above their natural ability was easy, everyone would be doing it. The coaching input of Dave Walder, Micky Ward and Scott MacLeod should not be underestimated but Hogg also salutes Richards’s squad‑building acumen. “He picks players based on what he thinks the squad needs, whether it be a big unit to truck it up the middle or someone with a bit more deft skill. Sometimes it’s not always about the best players, it’s about combinations and how they complement each other.”Should the Falcons upset Exeter it will be no surprise to anyone within Richards’s inner circle."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dbb255413e1a93c6c725879fe83eadadfd1a89db/202_397_2862_1717/master/2862.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3e222b7952983539a707679bd23fcdd0","title":"rafael nadal fabio fognini italian open maria sharapova jelena ostapenko","story":"It seems odd that Rafael Nadal’s domination on clay in Monte Carlo, Barcelona and Paris has not been so evident in Rome, where he has a mere seven titles and last appeared in the semi-finals four years ago. Still he will hardly complain and he will be mightily happy if he wins on Sunday as it will haul him back to No\u0026nbsp1 in the world above the absent Roger\u0026nbspFederer.The man he defeated 4-6, 6-1, 6-2 on Friday to reach the semi‑finals, Fabio Fognini, will afford the Spaniard little sympathy if he falls short. This was Fognini’s first quarter-final at his home tournament at the 13th attempt and he must have thought he could go further, or even all the way, when he came from 4-1 down in the first set to send Roman tennis fans into a frenzy on a perfect summer’s day.Last year Fognini defeated Andy Murray before the eventual champion, Alexander Zverev, put him out in the third round. But, at 30 and happily married to the retired 2015 US Open champion, Flavia Pennetta, he seems to have drained his game of the maddening inconsistencies that did for him so often in the past. Here it was Nadal’s forehand and a failing knee that stopped his bid.At 15-30 and 4-4 Nadal went behind for the first time after 53 minutes. Fognini, who had sprayed a dozen unforced errors around the Campo Centrale, was energised. He needed to hold serve to take only his 11th set off Nadal in 14 matches – and he did it right on the hour with a rasping forehand.The only man in tennis who puts his towel between his teeth had the bit there now but he knew retaliation would be swift. Nadal, roused from his slumber, opened up another 4-1 lead and this time levelled at a set apiece.Shaken by the counterattack Fognini resisted as best he could. This was an adagio, slow and drawn out, rather than the crescendo that Johanna Konta had referred to the previous day, describing that urge to finish a match in a rush. Fognini, limping, shoved a weary backhand wide and it was over after two and a quarter hours.“I made a couple of mistakes in the first set,” Nadal said. “I should not lose two serves in a row but he was taking the ball earlier than me and was able to control points from the baseline. Then I played a little more aggressive on my forehand.”It was the first time since Nadal returned to the Tour from injury that he had come from a set down to win. That pleased him immensely. “I had five months without completing a tournament. Since Shanghai until Monte Carlo I didn’t complete not one event. So the comeback has been great, no?”Yes, it has: it took Dominic Thiem on an inspired day in Madrid last week to snap his run of 50 sets on clay. He looks in the mood to resume his sequence.Following them on to the tournament’s cavernous showcourt on Friday Maria Sharapova found Konta’s conqueror, Jelena Ostapenko, a mirror image of bloodymindedness, the Latvian grinding her down to take the first set at the fifth attempt. Three hours and 10 minutes later it was the Russian who was smiling.She advanced to the semi‑finals on the back of a fighting 6-7 (6), 6-4, 7-5 win that was engrossing, brutal and riddled with mistakes on both sides of the net: 21 double faults and 110 unforced errors.Ostapenko, behind in the serving cycle, needed to hold to stay on course for a two-set win, but Sharapova was equally determined. The former world No\u0026nbsp1 was as emotionless as ever when a double-fault – Ostapenko’s 10th – handed her set point. She cashed in with a cracking two-fister at a sufficiently acute angle, and they went to a third after more than two hours of attrition.There was not a lot of it that was pretty but it was don’t-look-away tennis. Hitting like prizefighters, Sharapova moved 5-2 ahead, before Ostapenko, wincing with a foot injury, reduced her arrears to 5-4.The Latvian was ecstatic when Sharapova butchered her first match point, relieved when she netted the second. At 5-5 it looked like the match would never end but it was ultimately put to bed, under lengthening shadows, when Sharapova drove a backhand down the line."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cffd261c5dfa71cc476844625b8bc8a4bd4f9d74/0_371_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aa8a55933692e4908d549ef4e201153a","title":"simon yates retains overall giro lead elia viviani wins 13th stage sprint finish","story":"Elia Viviani won the 13th stage to make it a hat trick of wins in the Giro d’Italia while Simon Yates remained in the overall lead on Friday as the race prepares to head into the mountains.Viviani won a bunch sprint at the end of the flat 180km (112-mile) leg from Ferrara to Nervesa della Battaglia for his first victory in Italy after two wins in Israel at the start.

You don’t get seven gallons of oil, or great melting mouthfuls\u0026nbspof face-scalding fat-soaked bird, so tangy and\u0026nbspmoist and crispy-skinned you’re already salivating over it now.Bad ideas that look delicious. Delicious ideas that are – despite being delicious – also clearly very bad. Ideas that end up with everyone catching salmonella, the house on fire and England 86 for eight on a nibbly green seamer. There was a note of this in the first sight of England’s squad for the Lord’s Test against Pakistan next week with specific reference to the gripping, oddly decadent selection of Jos Buttler as a specialist No\u0026nbsp7 batsman, given licence to wander out, sniff the air and basically make the game up in front of him.There is a degree of natural resistance to this, a sense that to pick Buttler is to devalue decisively the proving\u0026nbspgrounds of county cricket. Buttler averages 17\u0026nbspin\u0026nbspfour red‑ball games over the past year. His selection\u0026nbspis at odds with all we have heard about the informed methods of Ed\u0026nbspSmith, out there crunching his data curves, occasionally emitting a clank of excitement over some outstanding first-innings metrics from the strangely overlooked Cakebread-Thomas of Derbyshire\u0026nbspseconds.Instead we have this. Faced with an ailing team and a general anxiety about how to make all forms of cricket more instantly comestible the selectors have reached for the most more-ish option have decided, basically, to just give up and deep-fry the turkey.And yet it is undeniably the right thing to do. Not playing Buttler when you have the chance to play Buttler: that really would be weird. “He hasn’t been picked because of the IPL,” Smith said this week. But he clearly has. Buttler has been picked, in part, because he is famous, because right now he is among the top three hottest, most luminously attractive cricketers in the current edition of the sixth biggest sporting league in the world.This is simply the truth and everyone involved should embrace it, because it’s both entirely sensible and entirely consistent with the England and Wales Cricket Board’s more gimmicky attempts to popularise the game. If we’re willing to junk\u0026nbspthe basic robustness of the sport via the Hundred, to introduce the new colts cricket rules trailed\u0026nbspthis week – ditch the lbw law, double-run maxi zones in the field – then it looks like old-school good sense to pick the most pop-famous cricketer in the country as often as possible.The fact is Buttler stands outside the normal rules and numbers. This has been said before about other cricketers. But in this case it’s actually true. He was a ludicrous spectacle in the IPL this year, driving and cuffing and gliding his way to 389 runs off 258 balls at an average of 97, with that familiar, beautifully delicate kind of violence in those whip-crack wrists.It is traditional at this point to suggest batting on pitches where the ball moves, where a flighty fifty can lose a game rather than win it, is a different matter altogether. Plus Buttler has been batting with a self‑made technique in India, adopting that white‑ball power hitting stance, front leg shifted to one side so he can hit in front of square from the same base, sending the ball through the field in a weird flat, scything arc.The thing is, it works. Just as moving up to open has worked, despite the need to adapt instantly to new angles, speeds, pressures. English\u0026nbspcricket has no history of producing unorthodox players, certainly not at this global-genius level. But for once it is perhaps simply time to go with it.The real issue around Buttler’s career isn’t his ability to defend against the swinging ball. The absurdity of mature Buttler is that he is essentially a blank in his own country, a Category\u0026nbspA sports person in a global game who could probably walk in and buy a plastic bat in the Catford branch of Sports Direct without anyone offering a yawn of recognition.This week the chairman of the ECB told us children just don’t like cricket. This is of course dangerous nonsense. The game is good. The talent is there. But it is also invisible to swathes of the population, just as Buttler has become English sport’s great invisible superstar, hidden away behind the high hedge on the last\u0026nbspremaining patch of green.For an industry that spends a lot of time quivering and whining about what it doesn’t have, Buttler is the asset, the talent. Centre stage may be a little left of centre these days. But it’s time to get him out there."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a67457079307a81da7b6056c32b0a2533e86d48d/635_491_3845_2307/master/3845.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2b33d3521ab48090b551bf2691449352","title":"swan lake review royal ballet","story":"Royal Opera House, LondonThere are superlative performances – and the world’s most glamorous black tutu – in Liam Scarlett’s new take on the classicFundamentally, what I want from a production of Swan Lake is that it makes me weep for Siegfried and Odette – those two lost souls who perilously trust love to unlock them from isolation and despair. But I also need a production to convince me it has a reason for being on stage. Swan Lake is perhaps the greatest of all the fairytale ballets, yet no other classic has been subject to so many vapid or cynical retellings.The Royal’s last production was neither of those things. Yet during its 30 years on stage it never felt like a properly organic work, its cluttered, overwrought design at odds with the elegant restraint of its direction. So there is huge relief at the Opera House that its successor, choreographed by Liam Scarlett and designed by John Macfarlane, is of a very different order, a production fired by the closest of imaginative collaborations. It is far from a radical reinvention – the setting and choreography stay close to the 19th-century original – yet it stands out from so many other Swan Lakes in its attention to dramatic detail. The story’s controlling evil genius is Von Rothbart (Bennet Gartside), whom Scarlett develops far beyond the usual routine monster. Its clear that Rothbart feels a creepy kind of love for Odette (in the opening prologue his long magicians’ fingers trace her features with a malign eroticism) and his influence within the plot is extended by giving him a role in the palace as advisor to – and plotter against – the querulous, ageing Queen.Scarlett should sometimes dial down his dramatic instincts Gartside doesn’t need to stalk through act one with quite so mad a Rasputin glare. But in every other respect this first act sets the story excellently in motion. Macfarlane’s palace is oppressively formal there are guards everywhere, palace protocols and even though Siegfried is not without friends – there’s a nicely affecting dynamic between him, Benno and his two sisters – he seems to be trapped inside his own romantic loneliness.When Odette’s music calls to him deep from the enchanted forest, Macfarlane beautifully transforms the stage to a blasted lake and a Turner-esque moon (David Finn’s lighting is exemplary throughout). Scarlett’s directorial hand is subtly evident both in Rothbart’s puppeteering control of the swans and in the emotionally driven dancing of Siegfried (Vadim Muntagirov) and Odette (Marianela Nuñez). There’s a rapt tenderness between the two lovers and Nuñez, exquisitely attuned to her music, conveys the pain of Odette’s slow return to life in the wild birdlike flurries that haunt her dancing.Act three comes with a swagger of gilt – perhaps too much – but with a magnificent build-up of tension. Siegfried arrives late to the ball, the foreign princesses are entitled and predatory, and from the minute Odile arrives in the world’s most glamorous black tutu it’s clear that she and Rothbart are positioning themselves for a palace coup.The climactic pas de deux deserves a review in itself, as does all the superlative dancing from the production’s opening cast.

Egypt has kept Rafah largely sealed off since 2013, when the elected president Mohamed Morsi was removed from power.On Friday travellers were slowly moving towards the crossing. A bus arrived about every hour carrying people whose names appeared on lists provided by Hamas officials, who oversee who goes through the border.“Although some of the demonstrators threw molotov cocktails, used slingshots to throw stones, flew burning kites into Israel and attempted to use wire-cutters against the two fences between Gaza and Israel, these actions alone do not appear to constitute the imminent threat to life or deadly injury which could justify the use of lethal force,” he said.The council voted 29-2 with 14 abstentions to set up a commission of inquiry and back a resolution condemning “the disproportionate and indiscriminate use of force by the Israeli occupying forces against Palestinian civilians”.Israel’s ambassador to the UN, Aviva Raz Shechter, said her country tried to minimise casualties when it defended its borders against “terrorists” in Gaza. She accused Hamas militants of using human shields, and accused the council of indulging in the “worst form of anti-Israel obsession”.She said: “This special session, the resolution before you and its call for a commission of inquiry are yet again politically motivated and won’t change the situation on the ground by even one iota.” The commission of inquiry will be asked to produce a final report by next March.Israel has long argued that Hamas hides behind the civilian population in Gaza, as an explanation for the high casualty rates among non-combatants. It pounced on a claim by a Hamas official that 50 of the 60 people killed on Monday were associated with the group. Critics, including Israeli human rights lawyers and activists, say Israel’s use of lethal force rather than possible alternatives is a clear violation of human rights law.“Let me put it in a soundbite,” Michael Sfard, a lawyer, told Slate after Monday’s killings. “International law allows endangering human life in order to protect human life, not any other thing. And what we are seeing here is a deviation from that very simple, very important principle.”During six weeks of mass protests and violence along the Gaza border, Palestinian refugees have been demanding the right to return to their homes inside what is now Israel."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e1255421105a5e189956234f006dbc83b11cd491/565_82_2286_1371/master/2286.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fcfcc906ecff045a69fbc17993f8674d","title":"italy government cecile kyenge the league lega far right","story":"Cécile Kyenge, who is now an MEP, speaks out after the League agrees a power-sharing deal with M5SItaly’s first black cabinet minister has expressed deep concerns about the entry into Italy’s government of the League, as the far-right party and the populist Five Star Movement (M5S) revealed plans for more detention centres to be built across the country.Cécile Kyenge, who has been a regular target of racial abuse, said the League’s position as a coalition partner in the incoming government made her less hopeful about the possibility of Italy passing immigration reforms or other changes that would ease a path to citizenship for thousands of undocumented minors.“Many members of the League accept that they are racists,” she told the . “It is very difficult for me to see that a party that accepts it is racist is going to manage law, which is supposed to protect all the community.”On Friday the League – a secessionist party previously known as the Northern League – and the Five Star Movement unveiled a power-sharing agreement for a new populist government. The deal calls for changes to fiscal policy and a €780 (£680) monthly basic income for poor families.It also spells out a new crackdown on immigration, including a “serious and efficient” programme to drive out migrants who arrive in Italy illegally. The plan calls for more detention centres to be opened in every region, in which migrants could be held for up to 18 months.The agreement calls for an overhaul of the Dublin treaty, so that asylum seekers would be distributed across the EU instead of being required to stay in the country where they first arrive, and it calls for religious leaders to be registered with the state. All camps of “unregistered” Roma would be shut down under the plan.Italy’s general election on 4 March resulted in a hung parliament. Matteo Salvini, the head of the League, and the Five Star Movement’s Luigi di Maio have been locked in negotiations for weeks to agree on a common set of governing goals. The pair have still not agreed on who should serve as prime minister. The new government’s platform is expected to be approved by M5S members late on Friday in an online poll. On Monday, Di Maio and Salvini are expected to meet Italy’s president, Sergio Mattarella, to formalise the launch of the government. Once a prime minister has been nominated and ministers sworn in, the government will face a vote of confidence in the parliament. Both parties ran campaigns that vilified migrants, and Salvini has attacked Italy’s Roma population throughout his political career. It is not clear whether Italy has the legal right or resources to follow through on some of the radical ideas that were agreed, but the League vowed during the electoral campaign to institute mass deportations of asylum seekers to Africa as part of a reshaping of migration policies.Immigration experts said the new agreement meant programmes seeking to integrate new migrants could be closed. “They campaign against any positive actions or programmes, which are the very basis for any minority. This keeps them in a structurally backward position,” said Francesco Palermo, a former senator who was a vocal proponent of Romany rights in Italy. “It is more populist than racist, they feel this is what the voters want, and unfortunately average Italian society is against Roma, against migrants, against sexual minorities.”Kyenge, who now serves as an MEP, has worked for years to try to change Italy’s citizenship laws so that children of migrants can be recognised as Italians. Last year the government failed to pass a law that would have eased the path to citizenship for 800,000 minors who were born in Italy or came as young children. Kyenge said these children were unable to fully participate in schools and in society. “The identity of a person begins when you are little and it is then you must have an opportunity to say ‘I am an Italian’.”The Congolese-born doctor has lived in Italy since 1983, and has been on the receiving end of deeply offensive racist slurs. Roberto Calderoli, a senator and former minister under Silvio Berlusconi, likened her to an orangutan and told her she should be a minister “in her country”. Mario Borghezio, a far-right MEP, said Kyenge would impose a “bongo-bongo” administration on Italy – comments that led to him being expelled from a Ukip-led group in the European parliament. In 2017 a judge ordered him to pay €50,000 to Kyenge for his racist remarks.Kyenge still has bodyguards to protect her when she is in her home country, as a result of racist abuse from politicians. “People want to attack me because of the colour of my skin and many of those are politicians and it is very sad because politicians should give an example,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3515b9c4cc0b9c7942e83d695a7f77c218789e38/0_236_4730_2838/master/4730.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=657aecb249c9f0992bfabb9f317b3e8b","title":"radical kindness belgian town fostering vulnerable people tradition","story":"Residents in Geel have been taking in mentally ill strangers for hundreds of years. Now academics are looking to the small Flemish town for social care ideasMaria Lenaerts was seven years old when she came home from school one day to find a stranger at the kitchen table. It was September 1942 in Nazi-occupied Belgium. The young man looked afraid. He did not say a word to her. “He was sitting at the table like this,” she recalls, hiding her head in her arms. “He didn’t understand anything.”This was her first encounter with Jefkae Harbant, then an 18-year old with a learning disability and no place to call home. He was born in the French-speaking part of Belgium and did not speak a word of Dutch. Neither Maria nor her parents knew any French.News doesn\u0027t always have to be bad – indeed, the relentless focus on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame risks convincing the public that the world is hopeless and there is nothing we can do.This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come.Readers can recommend other projects, people and progress that we should report on by contacting us at theupside@theDespite the language barrier, Maria’s parents, who were cattle farmers in the Flemish lowlands, had decided to take the young man in. This was not only an act of wartime charity, but came from a centuries-old tradition of stretching out a hand to people on the margins of society.For hundreds of years, residents in the Belgian town of Geel have been giving a home to strangers with severe mental health problems or learning disabilities.This is not a bed for a night or a few weeks. Many boarders stay with the same family for years, often decades. Somehow a tradition from the age of Chaucer has survived and evolved into part of Flanders’ state healthcare system. In 2018, 205 people are Geel boarders, although home care is now only for those with mental health problems, not learning disabilities.In an age that is more aware of the crushing toll of mental illness, the homecare system has made this small town near Antwerp a curiosity. One in four people will experience mental health problems in their lives, according to the well-known World Health Organisation estimate, while a majority say their pain is deepened by stigma.Geel’s model of acceptance and “radical kindness” – to cite one medical journal – has stirred interest around the world. Academics and journalists have flocked to the small Flemish town searching for inspiration from an “innovation” that is 700 years old.Geel traces its boarding tradition to the 13th century, when people with all kinds of illnesses made a pilgrimage to the local Saint Dymphna’s church. According to the brutal legend, Dymphna was an Irish saint who was murdered in the town. Pilgrims travelled many miles to her church in Geel, searching for miracle cures. When there was no more room in the church sick bay, locals gave them a place to stay.The Geel homecare tradition was incorporated into the state in the 19th century, eventually ending under the umbrella of the Psychiatric Care Centre (OPZ). Most boarders have severe mental illnesses, such as schizophrenia or personality disorder. “They have a long history of disease and referrals. They are not capable of living alone,” says Mieke Celen, a psychiatrist at OPZ, who oversees the matchmaking process between foster families and patients.Foster families are never told the patient’s diagnosis, although they do get warning about behaviour that they might expect: can they live with someone who smokes or walks around the house during the night? Dr Celen says few relationships break down.One study of 17 foster relationships over five years, by the Belgian academics Eugeen Roosens and Lieve Van de Walle, found that only two families dropped out of the programme during the period. Geel’s medical professionals say the system makes a lot of sense. Boarders have better outcomes than patients in hospital: they take less medication and have fewer acute episodes, says Celen. Success means “having a life as normal as possible”, says Wilfried Bogaerts, an OPZ psychologist. “The programme is about life. It is not a miracle cure, it is not a magic system, but it is about finding this person the right place to live at the right time. “Very often there is a severe chronic problem that cannot be cured completely, so we try to make the best of it. We accept the limitations but then try to make the life of a boarder as good as possible.”For advocates, Geel’s forte is seeing the person, not a bundle of stigmatised labels straight from a medical textbook. Boarders are given responsibilities in the household, says Bogaerts: “They take care of the dog, go to the shop, do the dishes … so patients are needed and wanted.”For some observers, there is not enough evidence that the scheme really works. “There has been very little evaluation about the impact of this,” says Professor Sir Graham Thornicroft at King’s College London. “In terms of outcomes for iniduals, we don’t know about readmission rates, or satisfaction rates, or quality of life, or things we would normally want to assess for people with long-term needs.”Jefkae Harbant is exceptional, even by the standards of Geel family care. When the  visits, his 94th birthday is only a few days away. A cake has been ordered. Friends invited. There will be a family party.He still remembers the day he arrived on the family farm nearly 76 years ago. “He was not afraid, but it was difficult for an 18-year-old boy who came to an unknown environment,” recounts his care worker, Michelle Lambrechts, who acts as an interpreter.Maria is now 82 and has lived with Jefkae nearly all her life. When her father died in 1982, she became his foster “mother”, even though she is younger.After decades under the same roof, legal formalities have melted away. He is really a brother, she says, speaking through an interpreter, sitting in the house she has lived in all her life. There was was never a question that he would leave the family.Harbant’s foster father is Maria’s husband, Jules Teunkens, a retired glass-factory worker, now 86. Maria and Jules married in 1957. A 60th wedding anniversary mug bearing their black and white younger selves is sitting on a shelf crowded with bric-a-brac. While her husband worked at the factory, Maria Lenaerts brought up their three children and worked on the family farm. And Jefkae helped, milking the cows and tending vegetables.The family are rarely apart. Although social services offer respite care for holidays, Harbants does not like to stay at the hospital, recounts Lambrechts. “When Jefkae went to the ward, he cried a lot. He cries and he cries for hours because he doesn’t want to sit on the ward – he wants to be at home.” The number of families who take in boarders is in sharp decline, as Geel’s rural, churchgoing traditions fade into the past. More women are working. Fewer people farm the land. The traditional foster family is disappearing. Demand from patients is also falling. People with severe mental health problems no longer face the stark choice of hospital or boarding many are opting for other kinds of residential care.Geel reached its peak on the eve of the second world war, when 3,736 borders lived in the town. The numbers have been falling ever since and the decline has accelerated in the last two decades: in 2006 there were 46o borders, today 205. Younger families are proving hard to attract.The OPZ thinks the Geel model can survive, but would like the state to increase payments to families from the current maximum of €600 (£535) a month. “The openness of the community is pretty high,” Bogaerts says. “We should compensate families more so it is more attractive.”Maria Lenaerts would recommend taking in boarders, yet she doubts that the system fits with how people live now. “It won’t last,” she says. “People have a lot of activities and recreation – they don’t have time.”None of her children or grandchildren have taken in any boarders.This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

Assange has been holed up in Ecuador’s London embassy since 2012.Among his guests were senior staff members from RT, the Moscow TV network described by US intelligence agencies as the Kremlin’s “principal international propaganda outlet”.The visits by RT’s London bureau chief, Nikolay Bogachikhin, who is Russian, and Afshin Rattansi, a British citizen, are likely to attract attention.WikiLeaks’ publication of the emails, which painted an unfavourable picture of Clinton, is a central focus of US federal investigators conducting a criminal inquiry into possible collusion between Donald Trump’s campaign and the Kremlin.Speculation has swirled as to how the hacked emails reached WikiLeaks and who was aware that WikiLeaks had the emails. It is unclear if WikiLeaks obtained them physically or remotely, with delivery to Assange in person only one possibility. The logs do not provide answers.Assange’s visitors also included well-known WikiLeaks supporters such as the designer Vivienne Westwood, the journalist John Pilger and the German hacker Andy Müller-Maguhn. Müller-Maguhn told the Washington Post that he once delivered a thumb drive with personal messages to Assange in 2016. He said he was never in possession of the hacked Democratic emails and never transported them. WikiLeaks published the first tranche of Democratic party emails on 22 July 2016. A declassified US intelligence assessment released in January 2017 found the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, had ordered an “influence campaign” to undermine Clinton’s candidacy and boost Trump. The assessment singled out RT and referred to it as a “partner” of WikiLeaks.RT told the  that the broadcaster had been invited in June 2016 to participate in a WikiLeaks Brexit special, and that arrangements to participate in the show were made during the visits to the embassy. It said its journalists had no prior knowledge that Assange was in possession of the Clinton emails and never discussed the issue with Assange.The visitor logs were drawn up by an international firm brought in by Ecuador’s then president, Rafael Correa, to provide security for Assange. The secret programme was called Operation Hotel.Among the journalists, activists and artists who visited Assange in June and July 2016 were two Russian citizens, Bogachikhin and Yana Maximova, 28, a Russian émigré to the US who has worked as a volunteer journalist for a community radio station in Portland.Assange has a longstanding relationship with RT. He has regularly appeared in interviews with the Russian broadcaster and hosted a programme on RT in 2012.According to the logs, Bogachikhin visited the embassy twice in June 2016: once on 4 June, when he entered and left within a five-minute period, and again on 8 June, for a 22-minute visit. In an interview with the New York Times last year, Bogachikhin, the head of RT in the UK, dismissed claims that it was controlled by the Kremlin, and said the broadcaster was regulated as a “reputable news organisation” by Ofcom, the British media watchdog.Bogachikhin was described by a former colleague as a journalist who had quickly risen up the ranks at RT and wholeheartedly adopted the more aggressive pro-Russian editorial line that was established after 2008. His Twitter feed mirrors Moscow’s official view. Assange was also visited twice by Maximova, who was born in St Petersburg and moved to the US when she was 18. According to the visitor logs, she visited Assange for about two hours on 8 June and for half an hour on 9 June. The 8 June meeting coincided with a visit by Sarah Harrison, who was a close Assange adviser at the time.When she was contacted by phone, Maximova declined to discuss the meetings, and said an attorney in Washington DC would provide a written statement to the , which she described as “protocol”. The attorney’s statement never materialised and Maximova did not respond to repeated follow-up phone calls.While many of Assange’s visitors are well known in professional circles, Maximova is not. On LinkedIn, her occupation is described as “Dreamer”.She volunteered as an independent journalist with the Portland community radio broadcaster KBOO, a left-leaning station, from February to October 2014, according to another former volunteer there. Maximova, who said she was in Germany, declined to answer questions about the circumstances of her emigration to the US. Rattansi made three visits to Assange in June, including one that ended at 4.30am. The RT journalist has been a staunch defender of Assange and of Putin’s government. One of the visits, on 23 June 2016 – the day the UK voted to leave the EU – Rattansi hosted a broadcast at the Ecuadorian embassy.He returned with an RT camera crew on 2 August 2016 to interview Assange about his DNC email release. Rattansi’s broadcast was titled: “Do WikiLeaks have the email that will put Hillary Clinton in prison?”RT said: “At no point during those visits was there a discussion with either Mr Bogachikhin or Mr Rattansi about emails that related to the Clinton campaign. RT learned about those emails at the same time as everyone else – when WikiLeaks began publishing them.”Assange first declared that WikiLeaks was in possession of new Clinton material on 12 June 2016, in an interview with ITV’s Peston on Sunday. A lawsuit filed last month against WikiLeaks and the Trump campaign by the Democratic National Committee claimed Russian intelligence agents hacked into DNC servers in April 2016. WikiLeaks began publishing the material on 22 July 2016. Assange told Fox News’s Sean Hannity that the source of the material was not a state actor.Trump has denied that his presidential campaign colluded with Russians and called a criminal investigation led by Robert Mueller, the special counsel, a “witch-hunt”.Speculation about WikiLeaks’ publication of Clinton-related emails and whether anyone had advance knowledge of the leak has circulated around key Trump campaign advisers and friends of the president, including Roger Stone. Stone tweeted about WikiLeaks having further damning information about the DNC in August, before it was released in October. He has denied any involvement and said he communicated with the organisation through an intermediary.Additional reporting by Fernando Villavicencio and Cristina Solórzano."},{"url":null,"title":"irish times poll public divided on approach to brexit","story":"Voters are ided on the Government’s approach to Brexit, the Border issue and its future approach to the negotiations, the latest Ipsos MRBI opinion poll has found.Almost four in 10 voters (39 per cent) say that the Government is doing a good job on Brexit, but a third (33 per cent) disagree, saying the Government is not doing a good job. Almost as many (29 per cent) say they are not sure. Better-off voters are more likely to approve of the Government’s performance on Brexit, as are voters in Dublin. Urban voters in general have a better view of the Government’s performance.Other questions show similar isions. Asked if the Border is the most important issue, 45 per cent of respondents agree, but 42 per cent disagree, with 14 per cent declining to express a position.Farmers (55 per cent) and voters in the Connacht-Ulster region (49 per cent) are the most likely to prioritise the Border.Just under a third (32 per cent) of voters expect there to be a hard border, but more voters (42 per cent) say they expect Brexit to result in a soft border. Just over a quarter (26 per cent) say they do not know.Voters are almost evenly ided on the best approach to the Brexit negotiations in the coming weeks.Asked the following question: “If there is no progress on the Border issue, should the Government insist that the EU halts negotiations with the UK, or should it let negotiations continue?” In response 40 per cent of those polled favour halting the negotiations while 41 per cent say the negotiations should continue.The Government has repeatedly threatened to block progress on the withdrawal treatment if it does not see sufficient progress on dealing with the Border issues before the June summit of EU leaders.At present, the Government expects the British government to advance new proposals for some sort of customs partnership in the coming weeks. At that point the Irish Government will have to decide whether these proposals form a basis for future progress to ensure a soft border, or whether to insist that the UK comes up with a viable text for the “backstop” agreement before June.The backstop agreement, agreed by the British prime minister Theresa May last December and confirmed at the most recent summit of European leaders in March, promises to maintain the same regulations for trade and customs on both sides of the Border even if there is no agreement between the EU and the UK on ways to avoid a hard border.At the time Ms May also pledged to unionists in the North that any plan would maintain the UK’s single market. When the EU produced a draft wording that would have kept the North effectively in the EU customs union, it was rejected out of hand by Ms May, though the British government remains committed to the principle of maintaining a soft border with no new barriers or infrastructure.Yesterday in Sofia, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar stuck a tough note, saying that the Withdrawal Agreement could be in jeopardy with progress on Border issues. However, the poll suggests that public opinion is ided on the Government’s approach.Previously, the Government saw a boost in its fortunes after securing the British agreement to the backstop at the December summit, so the apprehension as seen in the Ipsos MRBI opinion poll about the Government’s approach is likely to cause concern in Government Buildings. Ministers are also likely to note that while the Government has made the Border its red-line issue in the Brexit talks, public opinion is more equivocal. In addition, voters are clearly unsure about the wisdom of holding the Brexit talks hostage on the Border issue.The poll was conducted on Monday and Tuesday of this week in face-to-face interviews among a nationally representative sample of 1,200 eligible voters. Interviewing took place at 120 sampling points across all constituencies.

Photograph: Virginia MayoAP. Theresa May has set out in broad outline to Taoiseach Leo Varadkar long-awaited new British proposals on post-Brexit customs arrangements.The British prime minister is expected to put them in written form to EU negotiators within the next couple of weeks. Mr Varadkar refused to be drawn on the details of the proposals which have been the source of major disagreements in the British cabinet.However, the Taoiseach welcomed what he called the new insights into UK thinking. “Any move on customs that brings the UK closer to the EU is to be welcomed,” he said. Mr Varadkar said he told Ms May he could not comment on the proposals until she put them in writing. After that, he said, “we can give an intelligent or measured view of it”. He put down a clear marker on the single market which suggested that Ms May’s proposals were narrowly limited to customs issues and would have some way to go to meet Irish and EU requirements. “Customs is a huge part of avoiding a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland,” he told journalists in Sofia, Bulgaria. “While it’s a huge part of securing free trade between Britain and Ireland, it isn’t the only part of it. The single market is important as well as aspects related to regulation.” The pair met on the fringes of a European summit where Ms May also had meetings with the presidents of the European Council and Commission, Donald Tusk and Jean Claude Juncker. The former is also reported as having declined to pass judgment on Britain’s new plans insisting Ms May would have to put them in “black and white”. Mr Varadkar said that ahead of the European Council summit in June “a lot of work is still to be done if we’re going to make the ‘substantial progress’ that we need to see in June, particularly around the issues of customs and the customs element of the backstop”. Irish sources have been suggesting that a clear vision of how the UK sees the backstop being implemented needs to be on the table in June yesterday’s proposals may form part of that, once elaborated on. Asked if Ms May understood Irish concerns about regulatory alignment, the Taoiseach replied: “She does, yes. Certainly after today....” He said that the British prime minister “reaffirmed once again her absolute commitment to delivering on those commitments that were made in December, and I once again emphasised our absolute red line around our need to have those commitments reflected in the legal text. “I said to the prime minister that any move that the UK might make that would help to align all of the UK and the EU in terms of customs into the future would be beneficial, would help solve some of the problems in relation to the Border but not all of them. It would certainly help us continue to trade between Britain and Ireland much as we do now, but it wouldn’t solve all the problems.” Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3500508.1526664501!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexiteers resist theresa may s proposals for customs alignment","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritish prime minister Theresa May: Labour’s shadow Northern Ireland secretary Tony Lloyd said the proposal was no more than a temporary measure which was an inadequate response to the issue of the Border. Photograph: Andrew YatesGetty ImagesTheresa May’s plan to keep Britain aligned with the EU customs union after the end of a post-Brexit transition period has run into resistance from Conservative backbenchers, with former party leader Iain Duncan Smith warning that it should not last more than a month or two.The cabinet agreed this week that the whole of the United Kingdom could remain linked to the customs union beyond the end of 2020 if trade negotiations failed to find a solution that would keep the Irish Border open.Mr Duncan Smith said Brexiteers could accept such a move but only if it was very strictly limited in duration and he warned against agreeing to an extension at this stage in the negotiations.“If they do require to have some kind of backstop, most people will accept that on the basis that it is there for practical reasons but that it is not in any way about the politics, it is wholly about the practicalities,” he told the BBC.“Pre-announcing an extension would be barking mad – you would send a signal to the EU that we don’t know what we want.”Labour’s shadow Northern Ireland secretary Tony Lloyd said the prime minister’s proposal, which she has yet to outline in detail, was no more than a temporary measure which was an inadequate response to the issue of the Border.“If I was an investor looking to invest in my own constituency here in Rochdale, or for that matter anywhere across Northern Ireland, I’d want a bit more certainty about how long this is going to last,” he said.\u0026nbsp“We’ve got to have some real fleshing-out, because no hard border is not just for 2019, 2020, it’s got to be into the long future.”Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said this week that a plan for customs would not be enough to resolve the Border issue, which would require Britain to retain close ties to the single market too. EU negotiators are sceptical about a customs-only solution, pointing out that border checks would still be needed for regulatory purposes.\u0026nbspBrussels has also made clear that its proposed backstop for Northern Ireland, which would see the North effectively remain in parts of the single market, will not be available to the whole of the UK.Brexiteers on the Conservative backbenches are adamant that Britain must not maintain regulatory alignment for goods with the EU after Brexit and that the country must be free to negotiate new, independent trade deals as soon as possible.Following 15 defeats in the House of Lords on the EU Withdrawal Bill, Ms May has nominated nine new Conservative life peers, including a number of former MPs. Since most of the amendments opposed by the government were passed with majorities numbered in the dozens, the appointments will not make a decisive difference to the arithmetic in the upper house.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn nominated three life peers and DUP leader in Westminster Nigel Dodds nominated former mid-Ulster MP William McCrea.\u0026nbspNegotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce"},{"url":null,"title":"royal wedding countdown pictures prince harry meghan markles","story":"Royal wedding countdown: with the wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle just one day away, the excitement is mounting.Meghan Markle and her mother, Doria Ragland, arriving at Cliveden House Hotel on the National Trust\u0027s Cliveden Estate to spend the night before her wedding to Prince HarryAmerica\u0026#39s fascination with the Royal weddingHow and where to watch the Royal wedding - TV coverage, channel information, London screenings and start timesMeghan Markle: Everything we know about the American actress and how Prince Harry met his brideDuke and Duchess of Sussex?

He didn’t explain why, but I guess it’s because it might get in the way. Perhaps they don’t want us to look like homeless people after all the fuss that was made about getting them off the streets.“I can’t see why we couldn’t be allowed and then just take them down first thing in the morning. What would be the harm in that?”Dianne Donohue, 69, who came down from Leek, Staffordshire, with her daughter Emma, 41, said:“We had to sleep under the stars and it was freezing. We weren’t too happy about it.”But the edict is unlikely to ruin the party for Mrs Donohue and the hundreds of others expected to sleep along the route of the wedding procession over the coming nights.“It’s fun. We’re having a great time,” said the retired care worker.“We always make friends when we come down for the weddings. This is our fourth.“Our first was Diana and Charles and that was electrifying.”Thames Valley Police said tents had been banned to ensure prevent blockages on the pavement along the route.A spokeswoman for the force said: “Space in Windsor is at a premium and we want to make sure as many people as possible can be there and enjoy it in safety. Folding chairs and coverings will be permitted.”Windsor has been bedecked in Union Jack flags as fans from all over the country descended on the town in Berkshire.The fanfare has bemused locals, who have taken pictures of the already-gathering crowds.One wrote it provided photobomb opportunities galore, with a friend commenting: people are really setting up two days in advance aren\u0027t they!Another said: It’s starting to get a bit crazy round here, posting a picture of the crowds.Posting a photograph of a shopfront stuffed with memorabilia, another joked: Our local shops are going absolutely crazy selling all this stuff. Anyone want me to bring back a souvenir?! Armed police have been seen patrolling the streets, which have been set up with metal security barriers.A rehearsal for the royal wedding is due to take place in Windsor later.Some 250 members of the armed forces are expected to take part in Saturday\u0027s festivities, lining the streets as the newlywed Prince Harry and Meghan Markle head on a 25-minute carriage ride through the town.After months of planning, Thursday\u0027s dry-run will give organisers a chance to put some finishing touches to the global event.Royal wedding live updates: Prince Charles to walk Meghan Markle down aisleWhat time is the royal wedding?

The ceremony will omit the traditional moment of giving away, where the presiding Archbishop asks: Who giveth this woman to be married to this man?Ms Markle is understood to have asked the Prince of Wales to accompany her after her father, Thomas Markle, told her he was unable to fly to the UK.She has spent a great deal of time with him during her relationship with Prince Harry, a source said, and has built an affectionate bond. It was Ms Markle\u0027s idea to ask him to do the honours on her wedding day, offering the suggestion to Prince Harry who was delighted. The Prince of Wales was very happy to accept, a source said. Prince Harry and Ms Markle smiled and waved to photographers on Friday afternoon as they arrived at Windsor Castle in a Land Rover.They accompanied Ms Markle\u0027s mother, Doria Ragland, as she met the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh for the first time - for afternoon tea.Ms Ragland, a yoga instructor and social worker, had been the favourite to walk her daughter down the aisle, but will instead join her for the car journey to the chapel before taking her place in the congregation. Unlike Ms Ragland, Harry\u0027s father is vastly experienced at appearing at large-scale public events amid intense scrutiny. In statement, Kensington Palace said: Ms Meghan Markle has asked His Royal Highness The Prince of Wales to accompany her down the aisle of the Quire of St George\u0027s Chapel on her Wedding Day. The Prince of Wales is pleased to be able to  welcome Ms Markle to The Royal Family in this way. Ms Markle\u0027s father, Thomas Markle, pulled out of attending the wedding on medical advice in a dramatic upset just two days before the wedding.He cited heart problems after it emerged he had colluded with the paparazzi for staged photographs in his home town in Mexico.As royal superfans camped out overnight in Windsor to secure the best spots, Ms Markle and Prince Harry were spotted being driven into Windsor Castle for a final rehearsal in St George\u0027s Chapel on Thursday afternoon.Well-wishers gathered in Windsor will be hoping to catch another glimpse of the bride or groom on Friday before the big day.Harry accompanied his brother Prince William, now the Duke of Cambridge, on an impromptu walkabout outside Clarence House, in central London, the evening before his wedding to Kate Middleton.Crowds in Windsor got a glimpse of the Prince before he spends his final night of bachelorhood at the Dorchester Collection\u0027s Coworth Park in Ascot.

The beginning of the day will start off cold - around 6C (43F) or 7C (45F) - but will rapidly warm up.Temperatures will peak around 3 o\u0027clock at 21C (70F) and there will be light winds - all ideal for a wedding.The mercury is expected to have reached a summery 19C (66F) by the time the couple set off in the carriage procession.After lunch hosted by the Queen at St George\u0027s Hall at the castle, the wedding party will then move on to the evening reception at nearby Frogmore House hosted by the Prince of Wales.Once again we are expecting clear skies during the evening it will be pleasant with sunshine, but temperatures will drop relatively quickly, Mr Bowles said.At 8pm it will be around 12C (54F), but once you get past midnight it will be 8C (46F) or 9C (48F) and minimum temperatures will again be around 6C.A royal fan waits behind barriers on The Long Walk leading to Windsor Castle The sun will set at 8.53pm on Harry and Meghan\u0027s wedding day.

It\u0027s a slight shift from tradition.The chef, who owns the small, trendy Violet Bakery in east London, has been working with her team of six bakers full time for five days in the large kitchens of Buckingham Palace. She described the flavour of the cake as being a balance of sweet and tart, combined with ethereal elderflower.The cake, which is being decorated on the outside with a white, elderflower swiss meringue buttercream, is made of layered lemon sponge, drizzled with an elderflower syrup to a recipe specially created for the couple. The layers are sandwiched with buttercream and lemon curd.Some 200 Amalfi lemons are being used in the recipe, as well as 10 bottles of Sandringham Elderflower Cordial made using elderflower from the Queen\u0027s Sandringham estate, 20kgs of butter, 20 kgs of flour, 20kgs of sugar and 500 organic eggs from Suffolk.Claire Ptak, owner of Violet Bakery in Hackney, and head baker Izaak Adams put finishing touches to the cakeMs Ptak said: It\u0027s a lemon sponge - a special sponge that I developed just for the couple, and we drizzle the layers with elderflower cordial from the Sandringham estate so it\u0027s really lovely and as local as you can get.We have a lemon curd made from Amalfi lemons which to me have the most delicious flavour.And then we\u0027ve got elderflower swiss meringue buttercream.The bunting is going up and the sun is shining (for now).

Be that with gun salutes, marching guards, or golden carriages. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge during their wedding carriage procession in 2011There is no doubt that this royal wedding will pack a punch, just like Queen Victoria\u0027s marriage to Albert which featured a 21-gun salute as she embarked on her carriage procession at St Jame\u0027s Palace.  But it was not until King George VI\u0027s marriage to Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon in 1923 that royal weddings became public affairs they were married to great fanfare in order to lift the spirits of the nation after World War One (and royal weddings have been lavish events ever since).At 1pm, immediately after the service, Prince Harry and Ms Markle will leave Windsor Castle by carriage. They will be driven along Castle Hill, the High Street and into Windsor town centre before returning along the beautiful, tree-lined Long Walk for their reception. The whole procession is expected to take just 25 minutes.Meanwhile, guests from the congregation will wait for the happy couple in St George\u0027s Hall, to celebrate the first of the day\u0027s two receptions.To see the newlyweds up close, the best positions will be on the 2.64 mile stretch that rolls from Snow Hill to the gates of Windsor Castle. This is known as the \u0027Long Walk\u0027. The length of this section will allow thousands of spectators to catch a glimpse of Harry and Meghan in the final minutes of the procession.  There will be events on the Long Walk  throughout the day, with live screens showing footage from the ceremony.  On the hilltop above the procession route, the eagle-eyed can find a sweeping aerial view of the carriage ride. Snow Hill will offer fantastic views of the final moments and will be a popular picnic spot on the day, so get there early to reserve a spot.According to legend, King Henry VIII sat on Snow Hill to wait for news of the execution of his second wife, Queen Anne Boleyn. A precedent that has fortunately not been followed since. Prince Edward and his bride Sophie Rhys-Jones pass the crowd inside the grounds of Windsor Castle in an open carriage in 1999Royal fans can also mingle with the residents of Windsor as the carriage passes through the streets of the town centre. Although you should probably arrive at the crack of dawn if you\u0027re after a front-row High Street viewing spot - it\u0027s bound to get busy.With Windsor dressed in bunting and ceremonial decorations – and bursting with local street entertainment – the town will provide a feast for the eyes. Expect big screens showing live footage of the wedding plus an array of food stalls and general facilities will be available at both the Long Walk and Alexandra Gardens.Spectators can also line the entirety of the procession route, on Castle Hill, High Street, Sheet Street, Kings Road, Albert Road and the Long Walk. Disabled viewing spots will be available at the junctions of Victoria Street and Albert Road. The council has advised that visitors should not bring tents, but foldable chairs and umbrellas are fine. Also look out for the weather forecast on the day, and prepare for large crowds with plenty of food supplies, water, and sun cream. Further information will be published on the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead Council website. Of the three parking options on offer, most motorists should make use of the 6,000 designated parking spaces available at the Review Ground, Windsor Great Park, which is located to the south of Windsor Castle and the town centre.  Parking tickets must be booked in advance for a price of £30. These are being allocated on a first-come, first-serve basis. With wedding invitations being sent to more than 2,000 members of the public and many more expected to watch the ceremony on the town\u0027s live screens, it\u0027s a good idea get these sooner rather than later.This car park opens at 4am and closes at 10pm. Though it is next to the Long Walk, motorists will have to take a 25 minute stroll to the nearest spectator spots.  The second parking option is provided by Windsor Racecourse\u0027s \u0027Park and Float\u0027 service, which must also be booked in advance. There are 3,000 spots available for £30, as well as weekend parking packages, and the opportunity to journey into the heart of Windsor on a return boat trip for £10. The third car park can be found at The Windsor Boy\u0027s School, where motorists can park on a first-come-first basis on the day without pre-booking. This is expected to fill-up early in the morning. To accommodate the large number of attendees at Windsor\u0027s public events over the weekend, there will also be a series of road closures, beginning with a 9am - 2pm closure of the procession route on Thursday May 17. Then, from 10pm on Friday May 18 and until late on Saturday May 19, road closures will affect the procession route and surrounding roads. During this time Windsor residents will be able to leave the road closure area, but only emergency services vehicles can enter.Access to the car park on the Long Walk will not be affected by the road closures in place, at any time. Road closures beyond the procession route will take effect from 6am on Saturday May 19 these include Maidenhead Road, Clarence Road, Alma Road, St Leonards Road, Frances Road, Barry Avenue, and Datchet Road. Local authorities suggest that you check this live map of road closures to check what time the roads reopen from Saturday evening onwards. Rail operators will be running a bumper service on the wedding to help everyone get in and out of the celebrations at Windsor, which is expected to be one of the largest one-day events ever held on the local rail network.  Both Great Western and South Western will be increasing train frequency and capacity, with trains running up to four times an hour from London Waterloo and Slough. These services will also benefit from extra carriages to keep up with the expected demand, given that some of the 100,000 expected visitors will arrive by public transport. Windsor is served by two train stations that are within minutes of the town centre and Windsor Castle, making the railway a reliable option for getting to the Royal wedding celebrations: Windsor and Eton Central and Windsor and Eton Riverside.Queuing systems are likely to be in place at London Waterloo, Slough, Staines, and Windsor, whilst \u0027park and walk\u0027 and \u0027park and glide\u0027 bus services will help people get into town.Great Western Railway services connect Windsor and Eton station to South Wales and the West of England, as well as Reading and Oxford, via Slough. This branch-line service will be running with four carriages running every 20 minutes, from the very early hours of the morning to late on Saturday night. The journey from Reading or Oxford takes around 30 - 50 minutes and 50 - 75 minutes respectively, with a change required at Slough. Cardiff and Swansea are around two and a half hours away from Windsor, requiring changes at Reading and then Slough. London is connected to Windsor via the direct Waterloo to Windsor and Eton Riverside service, which takes one hour. Travellers have been advised not to take the London Paddington - Slough route, in order to ease rail congestion around Windsor. From the Midlands, take a Cross Country service from Birmingham New Street to Reading, and then change at Slough for the Eton Riverside station. This takes around two and a half hours.Train services from the North require changes at London terminals. Almost five hours of train travel await any royal super-fans making their way from Newcastle.  Because it is such a huge event, it is wise to make travel plans ahead of time – so make ticket bookings and travel arrangements well before the big day. Up to date advice on the best routes and how to pre-book your tickets, can be found at: for Great Western Railway here and South Western Railway here.Royal wedding: the best hotels for celebrating Prince Harry\u0027s and Meghan Markle\u0027s big dayThere will be a designated pick up and drop off point on the wedding day at King Edward VII Hospital, St Leonards Road. This will be the termination point for buses towards Windsor, as well as local routes. A full timetable of buses is available at the Royal Borough website, and more information on transport and bus alterations can be found here. Hotels, B\u0026ampBs and guesthouses will be bursting at the seams, so expect no empty hotel rooms in town for the duration of the wedding weekend. Royal fans had only a few hours to book the local accommodation offerings before rooms ran out after the announcement that Windsor would play host for the big day.Many residents and visitors will no doubt find a solution via room sharing service AirBnb, with the average price of a room around Windsor currently standing at £321 for Friday night and £286 for the Saturday night. Such prices look like a bargain, with some of the most expensive hotel rooms in Windsor going for up to £10,000. Alternative locations with more \u0027last-minute\u0027 availability include Heathrow, Bracknell and Weybridge. The council also suggests that anyone wanting help to find accommodation can contact the Royal Windsor Information Centre on 01753 743907 or by emailing: windsor.accommodation@rbwm. gov.uk.The monarchy has embarked on grand processions from coronations, marriages, funerals and other state occasions since the 15th century. Each year, a carriage procession carries the Queen to the State Opening of Parliament and the races at Ascot, although royal weddings and coronations are arguably the grandest occasions.   The last royal couple to undertake a carriage procession in Windsor was Prince Edward and Sophie Rhys-Jones – now the Earl and Countess of Wessex – after their wedding in St George\u0027s Chapel in 1999.Prince Edward and Sophie Rhys-Jones pictured in their carriage after their wedding in 1999It was the biggest occasion in the Berkshire town since since the funeral of King George VI in 1952.More recently, the newly-wed Duke and Duchess of Cambridge travelled through Westminster in a 1902 State Landau after their 2011 wedding, waving at thousands of well-wishers who had packed the streets to catch a glimpse of the happy couple. It\u0027s possible Harry and Meghan could use the same carriage. Steeped in history, the carriage was specifically built for King Edward VII in 1902 and is usually used by the Queen to meet foreign heads of state when they arrive on state visits to Britain.The Prince and Princess of Wales used it to travel back from St Paul’s Cathedral after their 1981 royal wedding, as did the Duke and Duchess of York in 1986. It was also used by the Queen during her Silver Wedding anniversary celebrations in 1972 and in her Silver and Diamond Jubilees in 1977 and 2012.Royal Wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan MarkleRoyal wedding live updates: Prince Charles to walk Meghan Markle down aisleWhat time is the royal wedding?

That contrasts with the 1.8 per cent of Greece, the member state that was the crucible of the eurozone crisis between 2010 and 2015.The country also accounts for just under a quarter of the sovereign debt of the currency bloc.“Although we have to brace ourselves for significant noise, including clashes between Rome and Brussels, a truly disruptive crisis is probably not on the cards for now. However, if highly-indebted Italy loosens the fiscal reins....the country would become vulnerable to a debt crisis if and when the next cyclical recession exposes the country’s weaknesses,” said Holger Schmieding of Berenberg\u0026nbspbank.You can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?We use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you.

It emphasises direct democracy and sits in Ukip’s group in the European parliament.Friday’s joint programme makes no mention of the parties’ stance on the EU or the euro, leaving the situation ambiguous. Officials in Brussels are worried that the parties will pick fights with the EU institutions if they get into government in one of the EU’s founding states.League leader Matteo Salvini said he and Five Star leader Luigi di Maio would meet with Italy’s mostly ceremonial president on Monday to form a government if their members signed off on the plan in votes due to be held before Sunday.“Days and nights of work,” he said in a statement on social media. “Do you like it?”The Five Star Movement won the most votes in March’s elections, garnering 32.7 per cent.

They have been in negotiations since Thursday in a bid to fuse their differing policies into a workable joint platform to end a 10-week political stalemate.Berlusconi allowed to run again for election as Italy’s prime minister“It has been a very productive day,” 31-year-old Mr Di Maio told reporters on Sunday, following several hours of talks with his counterpart in Milan.  He said they were close to a “historic” agreement, but their choice of prime minister has not yet been announced and confusion remains over who it will be.The Five Star Movement won 32 per cent of the vote at the election and the League took 17 per cent, making them the two largest groups in parliament.The leaders both said their talks on Sunday made progress on a policy document which is likely to be tough on immigration and the EU. Mr Salvini has previous pledged illegal immigrants would be rounded up and sent home “in 15 minutes” if he and his allies take power.The two parties are said to have agreed on who would be prime minister but there has been no word on who would lead the proposed government, with neither Mr Salvini nor Mr Di Maio willing to let the other take the helm.The far-right leader argues that, although his party has far fewer votes, he represents a centre-right alliance that won the support of 37 per cent of the electorate. That alliance also includes former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi‘s party Forza Italia, which said during the election campaign it would use the police and the military to round up 600,000 undocumented migrants and deport them if it came to power.The League and Five Star Movement have been in discussions over nominating an independent figure to lead the government, without allegiance to either party.On Sunday, Mr Di Maio said the prime minister would be a “political” figure, rather than a non-partisan technocrat.A 71-year-old economist and university professor, Giulio Sapelli, said on Monday he had spoken to both leaders and would be willing to do the job as long as former centre-right economy minister Domenico Siniscalco was appointed finance minister.Mr Sapelli said another candidate for the prime minister’s job was also under consideration law professor Giuseppe Conte.World news in picturesWorld news in picturesSanta Fe High School student Dakota Shrader is comforted by her mother Susan Davidson following a shooting at the school in Texas.

His supporters successfully campaigned for social and political reform and against a corrupt and dysfunctional political establishment.It was the latest surprise in the career of a man who barely survived the murder of his father, the revered Shia religious leader Mohammed Sadiq al-Sadr, and his two brothers, on the orders of Saddam Hussein in 1999.Four years later, after the US invasion of Iraq, he was in danger once again of being killed, this time by American forces who twice besieged him in the holy city of Najaf in 2004.Mr Sadr will be very much the kingmaker – though he will have no official position – in the formation of a new Iraqi government.His coalition, which includes the Iraqi Communist Party, independents and secularists as well as his religious followers, appealed strongly to Iraqis who feel that, with the war won against Isis, they need to rebuild their country.The Iraqi prime minister Haider al-Abadi hoped to win the election – though no party was ever likely to win an absolute majority – by appealing to voters as the leader who recaptured Mosul from Isis last year.He followed this up with a largely bloodless reoccupation of Kirkuk, held by the Kurds since 2003, and the restoration of a large measure of government authority in Iraqi Kurdistan.The political movement formed out of the largely Shia paramilitaries, the Hashd al-Shaabi, which came second in the polls, had, like Mr Abadi, hoped to win more votes through their role in the war against Isis.Coalition led by nationalist cleric takes shock lead in Iraqi electionUS and Iran battle for influence in first post-Isis Iraq electionWomen brace for Iraq’s election after race marked by harassment What would Trump have done about Saddam Hussein? But the drop in violence to a level not seen since the overthrow of Saddam Hussein means that Iraqis are focusing on the theft by the political elite of hundreds of billions of dollars in oil revenues that should have been used to improve the supply of water, electricity, waste disposal as well medical care and education.Mr Sadr has been frequently underestimated as a political leader since he first emerged from house arrest in Najaf at the time of the US invasion.He was described by the western media as a ‘maverick’ or ‘firebrand cleric’, but his views were always more sophisticated and flexible than he was given credit for.The origin of Mr Sadr’s influence was his family’s role as religious leaders and the martyrdom of many of them, beginning with the execution of Mohammed Baqr al-Sadr in 1980.His father led a movement that appealed to the Shia poor of Baghdad and southern Iraq, combining religious revivalism with social and political radicalism. From the start, Sadrism had a strong element of Iraqi nationalism in opposition to all foreign interference in Iraq, be it American, British or Iranian.‘The near future of Iraq is dark’: Warning from Muqtada al-Sadr -In an interview with The Independent in Najaf in 2013 – the first he had given face to face to a Western journalist for 10 years – Mr Sadr spoke graphically of the ill effects of Iraq inviting in different foreign powers to try to solve its problems. He compared this to “somebody who found a mouse in his house, then he kept a cat, then he wanted to get the cat out of the house so he kept a dog, then to get the dog out of his house he bought an elephant, so he bought a mouse”,Mr Sadr created the Shia paramilitary Mehdi Army to resist the Americans. He was later to stand this down during the Sunni-Shia sectarian mass killings of 2006-7, saying that it had been infiltrated by people not under his control.He was denounced by the US as a pro-Iranian proxy, but he has made clear over the years that he opposes Iranian interference as well as that of other countries.The Sadrist success in the election this month will be unwelcome in both Washington and Tehran.The US had done everything it could to back Mr Abadi as a victorious war leader and a sort of Iraqi Winston Churchill – forgetting, perhaps, that Churchill lost the British general election in 1945.Mr Sadr’s influence over an incoming government in Baghdad puts in doubt the future of the 10,000 American troops and military contractors in Iraq, though a Sadrist spokesman said after the election that US training and the weapons procurement from the US could continue.World news in picturesWorld news in picturesSanta Fe High School student Dakota Shrader is comforted by her mother Susan Davidson following a shooting at the school in Texas.

When I interviewed him five years ago he warned against Sunni-Shia sectarianism and foreign interference. He said: “The Iraqi people will disintegrate, its government will disintegrate and it will be easy for foreign powers to control the country.” This prediction was to be fulfilled six months later when Isis took Mosul and the Iraqi army broke up.Mr Sadr said that sectarianism was spreading at street level and “if it spreads among the people, it will be difficult to fight”.Iraqi politics is still largely based on sectarian or ethnic identity – Shia, Sunni and Kurd – but the religious parties that were in the ascendant after 2003 have discredited themselves. The majority Shia community is also more confident, after its military victories last year, that it is firmly in control and is not going to be dispossessed from power.Mr Sadr said that the problem was that the Iraqi psychology had been shaped by a “constant cycle of violence: Saddam, occupation, war after war, first Gulf war, the second Gulf war, then the occupation war”.The election this month, in which so many voters gave priority to social rather than security issues, may show that, as violence ebbs, Iraqis are becoming less traumatised.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Rooms have been renovated, flowers planted in the design of the US flag and the seal of the US embassy has gone up.Security around the building has been upgraded, road signs installed and CCTV cameras set up in the area – all part of the renovations that President Trump says have cost a modest $400,000 (£295,000).After 14 months of rapid preparations, the consulate will be inaugurated to huge fanfare, with about 800 guests and a video address by President Trump beamed live around the world.The consulate building in Agron Road was constructed in 1868It was one of the first houses built outside Jerusalem\u0027s old city wallsThe original building had only two storeys a third was added in the early 20th centuryThe complex currently covers about 6,000 square metresPlans suggest it will be four times as big once converted, by the end of next yearRenovation work so far has cost £295,000The US government leases a second site in Jerusalem, in Nablus Road, providing visa services It will be a largely symbolic affair, however, because up to six more years of work are planned, including a 10ft perimeter wall, an opulent new chamber and several new floors – both upwards and underground – to house the 850 staff moving from Tel Aviv. Timed to coincide with the 70th anniversary of the founding of the state of Israel, the opening has been hailed as the beginning of a new quarter in Arnona, south Jerusalem, for embassies from countries around the world that will spring up there.We will soon see the true nature of Trump’s work in the Middle EastNew law allows Palestinians in Jerusalem to have residency strippedTrump says recognising Jerusalem as Israel’s capital ‘was wonderful\u0027“We might have to build dozens of embassies, and we would need new land ready for that purpose. I asked my ministry to vigorously take action as fast as possible, said construction minister Yoav Galant, The Jerusalem Post reported.Mr Galant even suggested possible names for the embassies area, the Post said. He initially called it “Embassy Town” but then decided he preferred “Trump Town” after the US president, who has deemed the city Israel’s capital. Ministers have already announced a new railway station near the Western Wall will be named after Mr Trump.The plan for the new consular facility was created and approved in little over a year thanks to the finance minister, Moshe Kahlon, exercising his authority to fast-track the process. And there will be celebrations aplenty on Monday.Many of those who know the site best, however, will not be joining in the festivities.When the rebuilding work begins in earnest, the embassy will be created in part by converting the Diplomat Hotel next door, which it also owns. The embassy will use the consulate building in the short term, but sources suggest the Diplomat is slated to house the embassy in the long run.For years, the hotel has been leased out as housing for about 450 elderly immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Now, the building is due to be demolished in two years’ time when the lease expires – and the residents have nowhere to go.Many of these men and women were doctors, musicians and academics in Russia before moving to Israel in the early 1990s, according to The Times of Israel. Some moved straight into the Diplomat and have never had any other home in the country. Most worked in minimum-wage jobs.Some of the former Soviet citizens are in their 90s and have had the anxiety of not knowing their fate hanging over them for four years, since they were warned in 2014 the hotel could close.Palestinians clash with Israeli troops during mass demonstrationsPalestinians clash with Israeli troops during mass demonstrationsPalestinian protesters flee from teargas Israeli soldiers stand as Palestinian protesters gather on the Israel Gaza borderA Palestinian is carried on a stretcher after being injured during the demonstrationIsraeli soldiers take aim as they lie prone over an earth barrier along the border with the Gaza strip in the southern Israeli kibbutz of Nahal Oz as Palestinians demonstrate on the other side commemorating Land DayPalestinian paramedics evacuate an injured man on the Gaza side of the Israel-Gaza borderPalestinians demonstrate with crossed-out posters depicting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and US President Donald Trump, during a tent city protest near Khan Yunis in the southern Gaza StripPalestinian protesters flee from teargas Israeli soldiers shoot tear gas grenades towards the Palestinian tent city protest commemorating Land DayPalestinian protesters take cover from Israeli troopsPalestinians chant slogans as they attend a demonstration near the Gaza Strip borderWhen Mr Trump announced in December the embassy would move, it prompted shock and concern among both allies and critics because of the city’s contested status.The Palestinians want their own state with a capital in East Jerusalem, which Israel captured from Jordanian control in 1967, and many countries have been reluctant to endorse Mr Trump’s idea.However, in a confident gesture in advance of the embassy move, officials changed its Twitter name from USEmbassyTelAviv to USEmbassyJerusalem.The complex currently covers 6,000 square metres but blueprints given to planning authorities show it eventually covering about 20,000 square metres or more – four times the size. The US State Department says the new purpose-built building will be ​​a long-term project.According to Ynet News, the website of Yedioth Ahronoth, an Israeli newspaper, 20 planning companies and two New York firms were hired for the project. The US State Department usually employs selected American firms, but deviated from the norm by hiring an Israeli team, including architect Amir Mann and an Israeli contractor to carry out the work, it said.A five-storey structure was originally planned but to keep costs down the extra floors have not yet been completed, and the ambassador, David Friedman, will make only limited use of the embassy for now, using it for work but not yet moving in full-time.Both the Tel Aviv and Jerusalem consulates will provide passports and US visa services during the transition period.Neighbours have complained that the work, carried out under time pressures, could be environmentally unfriendly and risk going against planning and construction bylaws.But none is as worried as the 450 Russian residents.The job of finding a new home for them is down to Israel’s Immigrant Absorption Ministry.Ksenia Svetlova, a member of the Knesset, of the Zionist Union party, said the ministry has no set plan as to where or how the residents will be moved, and no estimate of potential costs or subsequent budget.She fears residents could be forced out before June 2020, when the lease expires.Just a few days before the historic opening of the beautiful United States Embassy in Jerusalem, Israel.

A few years ago these GPS satellite tags could only be fitted to big birds like eagles or cranes or storks and things like that and now we are fitting them to smaller birds of prey like hen harriers.

And that\u0026rsquos difficult to combat and they know that.We\u0026rsquove caught people on camera committing wildlife crimes. A solution to that is they all go out wearing balaclavas.Mr Thomson, speaking in a podcast, said satellite tags were 25 times more likely to fail suddenly and mysteriously in Scotland than any other country in the world, suggesting the birds were being killed and the transmitters destroyed.\u0026nbspThe missing birds of prey including golden eagles and sea eagles (pictured)And he called for stronger deterrents for criminals who believe they are \u0026ldquoindestructible. He said: \u0026ldquoWhen you get cases where you have video of an inidual committing the crime and they still aren\u0026rsquot prosecuted, they\u0026rsquoll be thinking, \u0026lsquoI\u0026rsquom indestructible here\u0026rsquo, so the balance needs to be redressed.\u0026ldquoThey do still get away with it. These crimes are taking place in the middle of nowhere where witnesses are few and far between, where finding the evidence to prove that that bird was killed by that person is well nigh impossible.Mr Thomson said Scotland is considerably further ahead of the rest of the UK, however, in terms of developing and strengthening legislation, and putting in place other potential sanctions and deterrents.He added: \u0026ldquoI am accused often by representatives of the gamekeeping or the landowning fraternity saying, \u0026lsquoYou just want gamekeepers sent to prison\u0026rsquo. Nothing could be further from the truth.

Veils, polka dots, puff sleeves, she was always trying new things.Would she have liked Meghan? I think so.She’d have run her eye up and down her because although she wasn’t the sharpest tool in the box academia-wise, she had an A+ in intuition, but the important thing to her would be to know that she loved her son.If you could show her that then that would have been enough.If Diana was alive today I’ve no doubt she would be heavily involved with Meghan and Catherine and her grandchildren – and she would have been a very fun grandma.Want to celebrate Harry and Meghans wedding like a royal?Weve made a brand new Snapchat lens just for the big day!Unlock The Suns Royal Wedding lens on Snapchat here and send us your snaps to @TheSunUKOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It is to the Left’s shame that they act as its stooges.Andrew Parker is immersed in the facts about the Salisbury poisoning and other outrages. The Kremlin, he says, is guilty of “criminal thuggery” and covers its tracks with “bare-faced” lies.This should be indisputable. But Labour is now run by the gangster state’s apologists.

Everyone cheers.He does a fist pump to his mates and she pulls down her boob tube, flashing her breasts at her girlfriends.The same guy went on to have sex with five other women that evening.By the end of the night he was rubbing cocaine on his willy to try to maintain an erection.Over one summer I saw people having sex on stage, witnessed vast quantities of alcohol downed in seconds and dodged more puke on pavements in one hour than an A\u0026ampE nurse cleans up over New Year’s Eve.It might sound depraved and debauched but the fortnight rite of passage ensured those same kids returned home as smarter and wiser adults.Over the years I have made ­countless 18-30-based documentaries around the Med.The behaviour is wilder and more X-rated than any brochure can suggest — without it being relegated to the top shelf.That’s why I am gutted that there is a question mark dangling over the experience Club 18-30 owners Thomas Cook said this week it is “exploring options” for the brand’s future, including a possible sale.Naysayers may comment “bloody good riddance” to the iconic institution that sticks two fingers up to political correctness. But I disagree.Back in the Eighties and Nineties there were no low-cost flights to Alicante or flight-comparison websites.Instead the entire package tour was laid on for you — and there were zero complaints.The hotels were laughably basic. The food was about as foreign as a Maccy D’s.The pools often had more than lilos floating in them. But none of that mattered.The “factory fortnight” annual leave was when things really kicked off in resorts such as Ibiza’s San Antonio and Corfu’s Kavos.When the night flights churned out the up-for-it guys and girls, most didn’t bother going to bed.When you arrived the reps flogged you the tours that went with the holiday — the bar crawls, booze cruises and wet T-shirt contests.In reality, the price of the add-on excursions doubled the cost of the holiday. But no one cared because to decline was to miss out on the opportunity for lots of sex.Sex underpins the 18-30 experience and the games designed by the reps encourage it.Whether it is passing a water-filled condom down a line using only your thighs, or timing who can put the condom on an oiled courgette the quickest.To be a holiday rep you need the drinking stamina of an elephant and the energy of the Duracell bunny. Many burned out or got kicked out and sent back to the UK. Holiday reps aren’t supposed to shag one another — obviously that rule goes out the window the second the plane lifts off from Britain.In every resort I have filmed at, the reps have kept score of the ­number of women they had sex with. Did the girls know this? Absolutely. Did they care? No.Is it a suspect institution rotten to the core? Nope. What I saw is that underneath the sex, the dubious games and the round-the-clock drinking was an 18-30 safety net that protected men and women on ­holiday. The bar crawls were staffed by dozens of reps ensuring everyone got safely from one pub to another.Admittedly by the end of each bar crawl it wasn’t unusual to see couples attempting to have sex against the bar, someone crashed out on the pavement in his urine-stained jeans or a girl face down in a goldfish-sized cocktail bowl of her own vomit.But the purpose of the night was to consume enough shots to fill an Olympic-sized swimming pool — and make it out alive afterwards.The opportunity for sex is jumped on every minute of the day. I made the mistake of meeting the groups I was filming for a morning-after catch-up.I soon stopped using my universal door card key — because I’d often interrupt a couple in the kitchen, the loo or even on the balcony going at it hell for leather.The same women who prefer the missionary position and the lights off in the bedroom back in the UK don’t give a monkeys when they are away.It can be the only reason so many willingly enter the wet T-shirt competitions.My theory is the more that a girl says “no way” the more likely you are to see her on stage, arms in the air, egging the crowd on with her soaked top clinging to her braless boobs.Us Brits are certainly not afraid to get wet and wildInclude a contact number and any pics when emailing into features@the-sunWho are we to judge if — for some women — there is something empowering about a bloke pouring a jug of water over her nipples? No one was forced to do it, either.While filming a beach sunrise, I got used to seeing women doing the walk of shame to their hotel. Sick in their hair, one shoe missing but usually with a cheeky smile on their faces. Sloping off to do the deed in the dunes And the beaches get busier when the sun goes down. While on a pub crawl it is easier to slope off to the sandy stretches than it is to bonk in an awkward, tiny loo with pee all over the floor.We could always tells those who had done the deed in the dunes — bites on their legs and sand burns on their knees. My favourite nights to film were out with groups of girls. “We’re not here for a long time, we’re here for a good time!” was the motto of one lot I followed.Make no mistake. Every girl had already earmarked their target.Getting ready and the female camaraderie was just as important as the night out itself. And if you didn’t get laid? You always had a mate to walk back to the apartment with. Perhaps the most outrageous nights were the foam parties.When the soapy liquid was fired over the dance floor it was as though a “have sex now!” klaxon had sounded. Clothes would regularly be lost in the foam. More than once I saw women in a panic because after the foam had evaporated they had nothing to wear to go home in.It wasn’t all sex, either. During one season a couple had a holiday romance and got engaged on the dance floor. On another island I’ve seen a holiday rep have the confidence to come out. For those who went home without a tan it was to be celebrated.But in the middle of the chaos, these holidays are a rite of passage that forge friendships, teach kids about responsibility and let them make the mistakes that turn teenagers into adults — and I for one am sad to see them go.FOR decades Club 18-30 promised a debauched week of sun, sea and sex.For many it was their first ever trip abroad, delivering cheap, basic accommodation and the freedom to misbehave with impunity (and no chance of an embarrassing Facebook post alerting folks back home).Fast forward through the decades and today’s Millennial youngsters are light years ahead of their parents. They’ve been on umpteen foreign holidays with their families and got used to decent hotels and great pools.So now our sophisticated young travellers are looking further – and wanting more. The success of TV show Love Island conjoured up the paradise excess they all wanted to emulate.Add to that Instagrammers bragging about their global travels and Snapchat feeds full of celebs living it large in luxury and today’s youngsters aren’t satisfied with a dodgy 2H hotel in Malia and a pub crawl up Bar Street.Today’s youngsters with limited budgets are savvy enough to know how to book a holiday on one of the many online travel agencies.Thomas Cook is now targetting the Millennials with money who want to be seen in the right resorts with plenty of selfie-perfect settings.It’s new Cook’s Club hotels – the first of which will open in Crete this summer – will offer urban-cool, stylish rooms, decent food and chilled tunes around a signature pool.Thomas Cook wants to ditch the lower end of the market to concentrate on those aspiring Millennials prepared to dig deeper to emulate their social media idols.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

A senior female member of staff discovered “inappropriate material of a sexual nature” in their station cupboard.That is, she found a pair of novelty tea mugs which featured nude women with the crew members’ heads super-imposed on them.They had swapped them as secret Santa gifts.Four other crew members have resigned in protest at the sackings, locals have started a petition to reinstate the pair and long-term donors have threatened to withdraw funding. But the RNLI insists it has not gone overboard. A statement claims the incident was “not trivial” as the saucy mugs presented a “safeguarding breach”.“Safeguarding” in this context clearly has nothing to do with the physical safety of those at risk of drowning, ostensibly the remit of the RNLI. One of the offenders had 15 years’ experience of saving lives at sea, which he is now forbidden to make use of.Apparently, safeguarding the emotional safety of any potential offence-taker is more important. Similarly, few will be surprised to hear of a humour deficit in academia. But one incident shows that a poorly received joke is no laughing matter.At the annual meeting of the International Studies Association (ISA) in San Francisco, some scholars found themselves in a crowded hotel lift. Simona Sharoni, a professor of women’s and gender studies at Merrimack College in Massachusetts, offered to press the buttons for her colleagues.Richard Ned Lebow, a political scientist at King’s College London, jokingly asked to be let off at the “ladies’ lingerie” department. It was a fairly standard, if old-fashioned, gag. But Sharoni claims that “as a survivor of sexual harassment”, she was “quite shaken by this incident”. Later that day she lodged a formal complaint.Hearing she had done it, Lebow attempted to reach out to her, writing that: “Like you, I am strongly opposed to the exploitation, coercion or humiliation of women.”However, making such a “frivolous” complaint, he argued, risked diverting attention from “the real offences that trouble us both”. By describing the obviously frivolous complaint as frivolous, he aggravated matters further, it seems. Sharoni hit back, saying she “cannot and will not remain silent when misogyny is at play”.She was not alone in confusing a harmless attempt at humour with a hatred for womankind.Last week, the ISA upheld her complaint, ordering Lebow to write an “unequivocal apology” for his “offensive and inappropriate” joke or face disciplinary action.To his credit, he has refused to comply and denounced the ISA’s ruling as a “horrifying and chilling example of political correctness” that “encourages others to censor their remarks for fear of retribution”.No reasonable adult of sound mind, with any experience of real life, could possibly find Lebow’s joke about ladies’ lingerie offensive, let alone misogynistic. But policing of such saucy jokes is more common than you would think.Free Speech University Rankings, recently revealed by online free speech website Spiked, showed some British universities and students’ unions have bans on offensive jokes and banter — usually as part of their policies against sexual harassment.And it is not just jobsworth bosses, snow- flake students and highly strung academics taking offence at harmless banter — as saucy puns can even become a police matter. A butcher in Staffordshire was recently rapped by the police for the innuendo-laden signs outside his shop.Slogans promoting “big-breasted birds”, “big cocks” and offers to “have your rump tenderized” have adorned his boards for ten years. No member of the public felt sufficiently offended to complain to the police in that time.Nevertheless, the local police chief inspector warned the butcher to “give careful consideration” to his slogans, in case anyone takes offence in future. The joyless claims that smutty humour constitutes sexual harassment, a safe- guarding breach or any tangible harm whatsoever, are certainly worthy of ridicule.But when jokes no naughtier than Victorian postcards can see people disciplined and sacked, and innuendos no saucier than a Carry On one-liner draw the attention of the police, we need to get serious about defending smut.Fraser Myers writes for spiked-online, where this article also appears.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Dhuhr is observed shortly after noon to again remember God and seek his guidance.Muslims must fast between sunrise and sunset every day in Ramadan.However, they enjoy one meal pre-dawn and one after sunset each day.The Suhur is consumed in the morning, as early as 2.30am, in the latter stages of the holy month.Breads, potatoes, eggs and rice are typically enjoyed as part of the Suhur, in addition to dairy products and fresh vegetables.The Iftar is a blessing, often enjoyed as a community, after sunset. This can be as late as 9.40pm in the latter part of the holy month.Fruits and vegetables are usually big parts of the Iftar, as are many delicacies unique to the Islam religion.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Surprisingly good shape if you’re one of those Remainer banshees who said the entire country would be worth about two bob by now — no investment, no jobs, swarms of killer bees and plagues of locusts.Not a bit of it. Take employment. We now have the highest employment levels, and the lowest unemployment, for 42 years. We have an unemployment rate of 4.2 per cent.Would you like to know how our major European partners are getting on in that regard? Well, it’s 9.2 per cent in France, 10.8 per cent in Italy, a whopping 16.4 per cent in Spain and, of course, 20.9 per cent in chicken-in-a-basket case Greece.We’re even closing in on Germany, at 3.6 per cent.So that’s not bad for starters. Average earnings are at last rising, too. Inflation is down. Business investment is up.Better still, we are experiencing the kind of export boom we haven’t seen for a long time. A massive ten per cent increase in the past year.And for those who think this will all come to a halt when we actually leave the EU — um, no.The official statistics predict the boom is going to grow and grow. By 2020 it will have increased by 22 per cent. Much, much quicker than the growth in exports in EU countries.By then, of course, we’ll have an entire world to trade with, free of restraint.Assuming the Government doesn’t bugger it up by keeping us in the EU’s customs union.So, contrary to what you are often told, the news is all rather good for the UK.And there’s another country where the economy is looking pretty good, too.Donald Trump’s USA. The stockmarket is soaring to record levels. The economy is growing at a more than decent rate.But who have been the main winners of Trump’s presidency when it comes to the economy?Horrible rich white business-men, you might guess. That’s what was said when he won the presidency — he’d look after people like himself.Nope again. Dead wrong. The main beneficiaries have been the poorest of Americans. And in particular the blacks and Hispanics. Unemployment is down, employment is up.There are more black and Hispanic people in work than at any time under Barack Obama’s hopeless administration.Under Obama, the country was paying out record amounts in welfare benefits and food stamps for its black and Hispanic citizens.And if Trump manages to strike some kind of lasting peace deal with North Korea, he’ll deserve the Nobel prize.So here’s a prediction.Despite the toddler temper tantrums among Lefties whenever the name Trump is mentioned, despite the curled lip and sneer from BBC news reporters, the shrieking protest marches from thick-as-mince unwashed millennials, despite all that,I’ll bet you now that Donald Trump gets re-elected.But don’t expect to hear much about any of this on the BBC’s News at Ten.A NEW survey has discovered what British people worry about most.What is it? Maybe the spectre of Diane Abbott being Home Secretary? Global warming? Nuclear warfare? Or the black shadow of death hanging over their heads?Nope. It’s “not being in when a parcel is delivered”.Just how crap a worry is that? And people lie awake at night.Gripped by the terror that the Amazon delivery man might call round with the spare part for the hedge-trimmer when they’re down the shops.SO, you lot – you’re all gammons, apparently.That’s the name given by Jeremy Corbyn supporters to working-class people who voted for Brexit.You are dense lumps of pig meat. Which is often served with a fried egg and some chips. And a bit of pineapple on top.They coined the phrase because some of the Brexiteers seen on Question Time have red faces. OK.Many people have called this “racist”. Sometimes I think there is nothing in this world of ours which couldn’t be called racist by someone desperate to be offended.It’s not racist. But it tells you exactly what the Labour Party thinks of working-class people, doesn’t it?HERE we go again. England fans have been warned not to take the flag of St George with them if they go to support our lads in the World Cup finals in Russia.The police have told them the flag is too “imperialistic” and “antagonistic”.So, every other nation will be waving their flag. Just not us.Mind you, I think I’d give Russia a swerve either way.If the Russki thugs don’t get you, then the police will.And you’ll have difficulty telling them apart. Or you’ll end up looking like one of those glo-sticks children wave around.Wait until the tournament is held in a civilised country.(So that’s Qatar out too then).Listen, it’s just a matter of economics.Making a dress the size of a bleedin’ aircraft hangar costs more than it does to make a nice size 12. It uses more material.So either cut out the seven stuffed-crust pizzas you eat every day for your elevenses, plus the bucket of chicken wings.Or pay the extra price.MORE good news – the Government has voted down attempts to strangle the Press.There will be no new Leveson inquiry.What’s more, it looks like Tom Watson is going to give up on his ludicrous campaign to force newspapers to pay court fees even when they win legal proceedings against them.Tom dreamed this up presumably with help from his best chum, the former fascist Max “Beat me, beat me, Brunehilde!” Mosley.Dead in the water, Watson.THINGS In This World I Don’t Care Much About (No 1): Whether Meghan’s dad Thomas, makes it to the wedding or not.

They’re the ones who provoked the rioters. Told them to break down the fence and kill Jews.But all that gets forgotten when there’s TV footage of Israeli soldiers shooting people.

It would have been a bit too daunting to have the eyes and the ears of the world on her.He pointed out that the decision would have been Meghans alone.Fellow commentator Victoria Arbiter wrote on Twitter: No doubt it will be a proud and beautiful moment for Charles walking Meghan down the aisle but I feel an even bigger moment has been missed with Doria.She later told 9Honey: Prince Charles has long talked about the fact that he would have loved a daughter, so this gives him an opportunity to walk a beautiful young lady down the aisle to his waiting son.Its going to be a deeply personal moment for the father and son, not to mention Meghan.I also think its a lovely way of showing that the Royal Family is behind this marriage.Meghan has really faced an amazing amount of vitriol and abuse from certain areas - people saying that shes not worthy of the Royal Family, or that she shouldnt be marrying into the Royal Family.It was today revealed that the Duke of Edinburgh would be attending the wedding of the year, after fears he may have to miss it due to a string of health issues.Its good news for Meghan and Harry, who have endured a turbulent week in the lead up to the big day.Meghan had yesterday released an emotionally-charged statement to confirm her 73-year-old dad Thomas Markle, who lives in Mexico, would not be able to attend her big day.In the statement, the bride-to-be said: Sadly my father will not be attending our wedding.I have always cared for my father and hope he can be given the space he needs to focus on his health.I would like to thank everyone who has offered generous messages of support. Please know how much Harry and I look forward to sharing our special day with you on Saturday.It was an astonishing statement that seemed to be directed towards her family, with her half-sister Samantha in particular claiming that she had needed to wire cash to their father to help him survive.Meghans estranged family members - including her nephews and sister-in-law - also landed in the UK despite not being invited to the wedding - have regularly trashed the 36-year-old bride.Claire Ptak, who is making the culinary centrepiece for the couples big day, revealed that it would be a non-traditional layout.But while the final look is top secret until tomorrow, the ingredients of the delicious dessert have been released.The cake includes:- 200 Amalfi lemons- 500 organic eggs from Suffolk- 20kgs of butter- 20kgs of flour- 20kgs of sugar- 10 bottles of Sandringham Elderflower CordialThe Royal Wedding plans were thrown into chaos when 73-year-old Thomas Sr announced he wouldnt be attending - after being left embarrassed over staged paparazzi photos.While Meghan reportedly begged her father to attend - saying she still loved him - her reclusive dad eventually pulled out.This means that mum Doria, who will today meet the Queen over afternoon tea, will be the only direct relative of Meghans at the wedding.Pals flew into the UK to support Meghan, with best friend Jessica Mulroney arriving this week.The Canadian socialites children are among those who will be bridesmaids and page boys during the ceremony.But despite the drama, Prince Harry and Meghan are now gearing up for the ceremony, with family having headed to Windsor for wedding rehearsals yesterday.The Duchess of Cambridge was among the members of the Royal Family seen heading to Windsor, the first time that she has been seen since the birth of Prince Louis.Thomas Sr has previously blamed his health woes on his son Thomas Markle Jr over an open letter he wrote to Prince Harry - branding the wedding as a fake fairy tale.But the dramas havent stopped royal fans from flocking to Windsor, with hundreds already at the town ahead of the big day."},{"url":null,"title":"lad slammed after setting up gofundme page to raise 1k to pay for his holiday","story":"Aiden Dugdale, from Burnley, posted on social media that he was sick of people on benefits being able to go abroad and I cant, so can people help?.He added: Why can people on benefits go on all inclusive 5 star hotel holidays abroad and I can barely afford a night out in Burnley?A friend then criticised him for his comments about people on benefits - so he posted: UPDATE: I have created a GoFundMe page so people can help pay for a holiday.The 19-year-old listed his fundraiser on GoFundMe in the emergencies category on the crowdfunding site.But while he says it is just a bit of fun, some friends havent seen it that way.One wrote: Nice try you tool!Another said: You scrounger, save up like other people and if a holiday is that important to you fund it yourself.But is has not all been in vain - as he has raised £10 so far.One supporter who donated £5 wrote: Proper made me smile this, good on ya.

It’s based on a couple of premises not a single country would be able to accept.“The costs are big and even then you don’t end up with a smooth border. You could perhaps have Max Fac in 2085, but it’s not readily available now or even in three to five years. It would be the miracle solution.”The official said the UK and EU could agree to either change the end date for the transition, currently set for December 2020, or to roll it over until an answer is found.They said: “There’s no legal limit, so in truth it will be a political decision in the end. It would be a bit more complicated if it’s really indefinite in time.”And they insisted EU leaders will not let the UK crash out without a deal given the risks that would pose to their economies.They revealed: “Leaders won’t want to take any additional risk that would dampen growth even more. There’s still a lot of common sense out there.”They made the remarks as it emerged Brexiteers have lost the battle within Cabinet over keeping us in the Customs Union beyond 2021.Ministers have thrashed out the compromise as an alternative to Brussels’ backstop proposal, which would see Northern Ireland stay in the Single Market and Customs Union.But it is likely to be immediately rejected by Eurocrats, who will insist the UK must extend the whole transition if it cannot find another way to avoid a hard border.They will also demand that Britain still signs up to a legal promise of a backstop regardless, with trust between the two sides over the issue at rock bottom.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But the “transition” was time-limited. This effectively extends that. When would it ever end? When the EU finally decides it is happy for new technology to monitor the Irish border.Never, in other words.It is already sneering it will take till 2085. It will use any excuse.We are told Britain would be free to sign trade deals during that time. But how could we negotiate without the flexibility to diverge from EU rules?We would be nominally “out”, yet forever marching in lockstep with it over trade. “Perpetual purgatory”, as Jacob Rees-Mogg rightly calls it.Theresa May is under huge pressure. But this is not seizing the opportunity Brexit presents. It is defeatism, attempted damage limitation without realising the REAL damage of a half-Brexit.The Cabinet is running scared of Brussels and Tory Remainers, as the EU ratchets up the panic.The alternative is to leave with no deal. But we are failing abjectly to prepare for that.It will cost us dear.IT is a national disgrace that shale gas was successfully demonised by a ­campaign of hysteria and lies.This is a potentially immense energy resource beneath our feet which could power the country cheaply for decades.But eco warriors’ baseless scaremongering about the environmental risks, amplified by social media and grossly irresponsible politicians, has prevailed.The tall tales were debunked, but the public remains afraid of fracking.We salute the Government, then, for finally grasping the nettle with measures to help firms explore for shale and compel councils to approve it.Not long ago we were self-sufficient for energy. Now we partly rely on the murderous, flaky Putin regime’s gas. We have to get cracking with fracking, like the US.And the Government must launch a PR offensive to convince a doubting nation it is clean and safe.IT would be insane not to ban combustible cladding on tower blocks after Grenfell.And it should be mandatory to test panels physically.We know the tragedy had several causes. We accept Dame Judith Hackitt’s damning view of a building regulations system unfit for purpose.But 71 people died. Why risk more lives with dodgy panels?The Government is already spending £400million removing them nationwide.It must thank Dame Judith for her report — then swiftly take far tougher action than she has in mind.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It needs to change to survive.Prime Minister Theresa May won as many votes last year as Margaret Thatcher did in her prime.She earned the party its biggest share of working-class votes since 1979.The Conservatives are now back ahead in the polls.But across some of the parts of the population that are growing the fastest, the Conservatives are still trailing behind Labour.In last year’s General Election, Jeremy Corbyn’s Little Red Book did not just win over university students.He also won over half of people in their thirties.A recent poll showed only nine per cent of those aged 25 to 39 say they will definitely vote Conservative.The Conservatives are behind among people who rent their homes privately — and there are twice the number doing that as there were in 2000.Nearly four times as many people from ethnic minority communities voted Labour than voted Tory — and those different communities are a growing part of our population.So if the Conservative Party does not broaden its reach, it is finished. It is that simple.That does not mean the Prime Minister should copy Corbyn’s empty promises.Let’s not forget that Labour’s most recent manifesto proposed to raise taxes to their highest level since World War Two.Or that Corbyn’s plans to borrow huge, unprecedented sums of money to embark on a spending spree would put a millstone of debt around the necks of younger people.Or that the only thing he wants to cut is our defence budget — and from the Falklands to Russia, he has a bad habit of siding with Britain’s enemies.The Tories have spent eight years cleaning up the mess Labour left behind. We do not want to repeat their mistakes.We remember the dangerous situation where the Government was borrowing a quarter of all the money it spent.We did the hard yards slashing the dole queues Labour left behind, and now we have got more people in work than ever before.But we can not just rest on our record. There are five big challenges we need to solve if we are going to deserve the votes of Sun readers at the next election.The FIRST is obvious — we have to make a success of Brexit. We should ignore pompous members of the House of Lords who say we should just override the democratic result of the referendum.But we should make sure we listen when businesses and exporters say they want sensible arrangements to keep business flowing between Britain and Europe. That’s exactly what the PM is negotiating.The SECOND is to give young people at least the same chances to get on in life that older people have enjoyed.That means reversing 15 years of falling home ownership and building more homes that young working people can afford.But it also means reforming taxes to focus on growing the number of homeowners, not just expanding the amount of rented property.The THIRD challenge is to build a united Britain and make the Conservative Party feel like the natural home for working people, whatever their race or religion.We believe we must continue to strongly control immigration and stop illegal immigration. But we also believe in making sure everyone can feel part of Britain.We admire those who have come here with nothing and built amazing businesses — and we know that the Conservative priorities of enterprise, family and education are often their priorities, too.Many feel very patriotic about this great country that is now their home. That is why we, as a party, must do much more to reach out to ethnic minority communities.It is why, in government, we must make sure that everyone, no matter their background, gets help to speak good English so they can get a good job and be part of a united country.FOURTH, we need to do much more to help places that have suffered in recent decades. Not just by aiding big cities such as Liverpool, Manchester and Birmingham — some of which are now growing faster than London.But also by tackling deprivation in the neglected smaller towns and coastal communities where opportunities have been hard to come by for years.FIFTH, we must build an economy that really does work for everyone, not just the well-off.It is brilliant that unemployment is at a 40-year low. But wages fell a long way in the last recession and though they are growing, working people have been through a very difficult decade.Policies such as the National Living Wage and tax cuts for the lower-paid have helped those who want to work, earn more and keep more of their earnings.But now we have to find ways to raise average wages and help businesses invest in their workers.Government should be taking more of a role in helping people to retrain between jobs or to work in new industries to reduce the impact of new technology.And we must do more to help working families with everyday costs of living. That means cutting high energy bills and helping working families who face some of the most expensive childcare in the developed world.If we do these things and govern always in the interests of working people, we can beat Corbyn’s tried-and-failed 1970s politics.By becoming the party for working people, the Conservative Party can earn a solid majority and make Britain fairer — and more united.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We haven’t been able to get any detail on that yet but certainly any move on customs that brings the UK closer to the EU is to be welcomed. “But I very much emphasised that resolving the issue of avoiding a hard border requires more than just customs. It would help solve some of the problems related to the border but not all of them.”The prospect of remaining aligned with Europe alarmed Brexiteers.Jacob Rees-Mogg said that if Mrs May agreed to what Mr Varadkar appeared to be proposing, it would be “a failure” of her policy of making Brexit mean Brexit.“She would have to eat a very large quantity of her own words. I have trust in the Prime Minister and I believe that this will not happen,” he said. "},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict0004008816474.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"meghan markle royal wedding prince harry princess diana harry","story":"Thomas Markle Jnr now insists the bride-to-be shares empathy and love for the common man.He told Mirror reporters outside Buckingham Palace: Perhaps Harry sees a lot of his mum in Meg, how she is with people.From the moment she could put her arms around someone, she always wanted to cuddle to them.She was an incredibly affectionate child who developed a tremendous sense of empathy and understanding for people.

At that point I decided to just walk away.”The photograph shows a grey-haired man with his pants down.Holding a piece of toilet paper, he is squatting over a concrete path by a brick wall and looking in the direction of the camera.Steve has since discovered that the man is married, and lives in a well-kept house with a manicured garden not far from the apartment block in the southeastern Brisbane suburb of Greenslopes.Steve wrote on Facebook that the man was a Greenslopes resident but he was “not sharing his name at this stage, unless he continues to do it”.“Hopefully someone (either friend, acquaintance or even his employer) will recognise him,” the commenter said.“I can see no reasonable excuse for his filthy and disgusting behaviour. The fact that he has done this on numerous occasions makes it even worse!”.Steve has distributed the poster in a local letter drop to houses including the one in which the poo jogger lives.Last year, a female jogger in Colorado dubbed the Mad Pooper left a family at their wits end when she repeatedly defecated in front of their home.He said that the man ran past on Mondays, Wednesday and Fridays, but did not stop to relieve himself on the path every time.“He ran straight past on Monday,” Steve said.He and other neighbours had tried to talk to the man, to no avail.Facebook users suggested having a police car outside the apartment block, and another said he hoped the photograph would “shame the police to take it seriously”.But it was pointed out that, at best, the man could be charged with trespass and be served with a notice.“As it is on private property the police cannot really do anything.

Please know how much Harry and I look forward to sharing our special day with you on Saturday.It was an astonishing statement that seemed to be directed towards her family, with her half-sister Samantha in particular claiming that she had needed to wire cash to their father to help him survive.Meghans estranged family members - including her nephews and sister-in-law - also landed in the UK despite not being invited to the wedding - have regularly trashed the 36-year-old bride.Claire Ptak, who is making the culinary centrepiece for the couples big day, revealed that it would be a non-traditional layout.But while the final look is top secret until tomorrow, the ingredients of the delicious dessert have been released.The cake includes:- 200 Amalfi lemons- 500 organic eggs from Suffolk- 20kgs of butter- 20kgs of flour- 20kgs of sugar- 10 bottles of Sandringham Elderflower CordialThe Royal Wedding plans were thrown into chaos when 73-year-old Thomas Sr announced he wouldnt be attending - after being left embarrassed over staged paparazzi photos.While Meghan reportedly begged her father to attend - saying she still loved him - her reclusive dad eventually pulled out.This means that mum Doria, who will today meet the Queen over afternoon tea, will be the only direct relative of Meghans at the wedding.Pals flew into the UK to support Meghan, with best friend Jessica Mulroney arriving this week.The Canadian socialites children are among those who will be bridesmaids and page boys during the ceremony.But despite the drama, Prince Harry and Meghan are now gearing up for the ceremony, with family having headed to Windsor for wedding rehearsals yesterday.The Duchess of Cambridge was among the members of the Royal Family seen heading to Windsor, the first time that she has been seen since the birth of Prince Louis.Thomas Sr has previously blamed his health woes on his son Thomas Markle Jr over an open letter he wrote to Prince Harry - branding the wedding as a fake fairy tale.But the dramas havent stopped royal fans from flocking to Windsor, with hundreds already at the town ahead of the big day."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/02/2048x1152/skynews-andrea-leadsom-mp-andrea-leadsom_4226061.jpg?20180208181140 ","title":"bercows alleged remark about leadsom unacceptable number 10 says","story":"While not wanting to detract from what she considers to be an example of bullying, \"she is coping with it and is not going to let this get to her\", the sources said.Mr Bercow is said to have made the remarks - which he has not denied - after Prime Minister\u0027s Questions as Transport Secretary Chris Grayling was about to make a statement on railways.Labour chief whip Nick Brown rose to complain that the opposition had been denied a copy of the statement and that it was being made to cut into time allocated for an opposition debate.The speaker then responded with an angry rant against the government, much of it directed at Ms Leadsom, and MPs claim his insult was then delivered under his breath.Responding to the latest accusation, a spokesperson for the speaker made no attempt to deny that he used the words attributed to him or that the target was Ms Leadsom.\"Wednesday was an unusual and controversial day in how business was handled in the House by the government and some strong and differing views were expressed on all sides on the subject,\" the spokesperson said.\"The speaker treats his colleagues with respect and strives at every turn to facilitate the House of Commons.\"The alleged comment about Ms Leadsom comes as the speaker battles to keep his job amid calls to quit over allegations he bullied and abused two former members of his Commons staff."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/05/2048x1152/skynews-guernsey-saint-peter-port_4313820.jpg?20180518142442 ","title":"meghan markles suits co stars arrive for the royal wedding","story":"He wrote the pub was \"his new favorite bar\" to which many of his followers corrected him, saying the establishment was in fact \"called a pub\" in Britain.Rick Hoffman, who plays highly strung lawyer Louis Litt, uploaded a short clip on his Instagram page telling his fans he was \"heading east for some special event and I\u0027m very excited about that\".He then posted a sunset photo from a plane window, alongside the caption: \"Sun up Shade down #touchdownatheathrow.\"Sarah Rafferty, who plays secretary Donna Paulsen in the legal drama, has not mentioned the wedding on her Instagram page - however, she has been travelling in Europe, posting family photos from Paris in recent days.

However, it is not known whether that will be in the wedding chapel or at the Frogmore reception, or both.Sir Elton holds a special place in Harry\u0027s heart as the singer was a close friend of his late mother, Diana, and penned and performed Candle in the Wind for her funeral in 1997.The Rocketman singer also attended William and Kate\u0027s wedding in 2011 and he has rescheduled two concert dates which were meant to be happening this weekend.Keeping with the British theme, there were rumours the Spice Girls may also sing, with Mel B - Scary Spice - apparently letting slip that the band would be performing at the royal wedding.:: Royal wedding 2018: The ultimate guide However, Mel C - Sporty Spice - then said she was \"joking\".Chart toppers Ed Sheeran, Sam Smith and Stormzy have also thrown their hats in the ring, all expressing interest in playing for the newest royal couple.As Hereford-born Ellie Goulding, a friend of Harry\u0027s, sang at William and Kate\u0027s wedding, it is unlikely she will perform at Saturday\u0027s reception.:: Meghan Markle\u0027s Suits co-stars arrive for royal wedding Some veteran acts could also be entertaining the couple and their friends and family.Another question will be what Meghan will be wearing for the reception.Her wedding dress, which is rumoured to have cost \u0026#163100,000 - paid for by herself - is sure to be the star of the show, just as Kate\u0027s was in 2011.Like her future sister-in-law, she is expected to change into something which is a bit easier to dance in for the reception. As an actress on the red carpet she is used to wearing striking, and sometimes revealing, dresses, so she could well choose something similar for the party.Royal weddings have more British traditions than most, but Meghan is sure to bring some American traditions of her own - especially to the reception.They have already bucked the British tradition of a fruit cake by having a lemon and elderflower sponge, and may well have more dainties at the after-party.In America, during the cake-cutting ceremony the newslyweds feed each other the first two slices of the cake - and often stuff the cake into each other\u0027s faces. The first dance in the UK takes place after the cake-cutting, but in America, the couple usually have the first dance immediately after they are announced into the dining room.Meghan is likely to toss her bouquet into a crowd of single female guests, but whether Harry will follow the American tradition of lifting up the bride\u0027s gown to pull off a garter and fling it into a group of his friends, remains to be seen. In the UK, the father of the bride usually gives a speech, but as Thomas Markle cannot attend, her mother, Doria Ragland, may give a speech.Harry and William, as the best man, will both give speeches as is traditional in the UK.However, what is very untraditional in the UK but very American, is the bride giving a speech.With Meghan\u0027s acting background and experience of giving passionate speeches about charitable causes she supports, she is also likely to give an address.She previously said she is not having a matron of honour as she could not pick between her good friends. However, as it is tradition in America for the chief bridesmaid to give a speech, either - or all - of her her best friends, Jessica Mulroney, Lindsay Roth and Misha Nonoo could give a speech."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/01/2048x1152/skynews-house-of-lords-peers_4216810.jpg?20180128154740 ","title":"tory brexit boost nine new conservative lords appointed","story":"Ahead of the announcement, Lord Adonis said the move was \"a classic example of packaging the Lords to try and make Brexit easier to endorse\".The nine new Lords are unlikely, however, to tip the balance in the upper house.The average defeat on the Withdrawal Bill in the Lords was by a margin of 67 peers.

And that is why today\u0027s announcement has sparked such outrage.On the one side there are those who think that controlling the scope of betting machines amounts to proof of a nanny state.The Government is meddling, they say, and it will cost jobs and destroy fun. If people want to waste their money on betting machines with a paltry chance at making a profit, so the argument goes, who are we to stop them.On the other side are those who point at the victims of gambling addiction, and who believe that the state\u0027s role is, basically, to stop people doing things that are bad for them, their families and, you might say, for society at large.Now it is hard to say that fixed-odds betting terminals do any social good. Yes, they raise money for the Treasury, and help bolster the profits of some - but not all - betting companies.It may be that some people find them fun, just as some people think fox hunting is fun, but social good? Hardly.The flip side is that it is hard to argue that they don\u0027t do harm - there are many stories of players frantically spending the family savings, of desperate addiction, and of the hapless inadequacy of the existing laws to stop repeat losers.One gambler lost \u0026#16314,000 in seven hours others have been convicted after smashing up shops in desperate fury.The industry will have us believe that these people will all drift to alternative locations - amusement arcades, casinos and shadowy back-street suppliers. The problem, they say, will just be moved elsewhere. What\u0027s more, so we are told, the collapse of these machines will also result in hundreds of shops closing, thousands of job losses, and a huge hit to the Exchequer.And yet sometimes Governments are there to make these sort of judgements.Presumably, somewhere, there are people who were laid off when the local land-mine factory closed.At the end of the First World War, workers were laid off from the factory in Avonmouth where Britain had been making mustard gas. It\u0027s not good enough, frankly, to defend something purely on the grounds that an industry supports jobs.As for the Treasury - that\u0027s a matter for the Government. But within the context of the nation\u0027s tax take, it\u0027s not a big loss, particularly when set off against the plans to impose a different levy on the betting industry.Our giant betting companies are all profitable enterprises, whose future is not dependent upon these machines.

We told how the Prime Minister hoped to “bury the bad news” she was sending another batch of party loyalists to the bloated House of Lords, which is already stuffed with about 800 peers.  And sure enough, at 4.55pm, nine new Conservatives were ennobled in an announcement overshadowed by the run-up to Prince Harry and Meghan Markle ’s nuptials tomorrow. The Tory cronies who will take ermine include ex-Social Secretary Peter Lilley and former Cabinet heavyweight Sir Eric Pickles, as we predicted. In total, six former MPs become Conservative peers, as does the party’s former deputy chairman Amanda Sater, and SafeLives charity founder Diana Barran. But former Chancellor George Osborne was snubbed. Ex-MP William McCrea, of the DUP , which props up Mrs May’s minority administration, also becomes a peer. The move came after Mrs May was humiliated by 15 Brexit defeats in the un-elected Chamber, where she does not have a majority. Labour was given three new peerages: former party general secretary Iain McNicol, veteran campaign Martha Osamor, mother of Shadow International Development Secretary Kate Osamor, and author Pauline Bryan.

Instead of grounding, taking sweets away and removing the television, almost two thirds of mums now threaten a complete ban on the game if their children misbehave. With some 40million players worldwide, British children as young as eight are playing the game for more than 13 hours every week. But a study of 858 parents of Fortnite-loving kids shows 54 per cent are concerned about the negative effects of the game. In particular, the average family polled endures 11 arguments a month because kids want to spend longer playing the irresistible survival shoot-outs.  Siobhan Freegard, founder of ChannelMum , which commissioned the research, said: “Our advice to parents is not to panic about Fortnite.   “Played sensibly it’s fun, sociable and can even help some children’s co-ordination skills. “But like any habit, if it takes over all other activities, then it needs to be managed sensibly with limits imposed. “Agree with your child what is acceptable use and ensure they stick to it. It may cause a Battle Royale in your home but it will be better for them long-term to have boundaries. “However even if you fear your child is a Fortnite addict, just wait a few months and they’ll forget all about it when the next craze comes in. “A few years ago it was Minecraft, and next year it will be something else. “Playgrounds are fickle places and even the most popular games don’t stay top of the leader board forever.”  The study found 63 per cent of parents find themselves arguing constantly about the attitude they receive when asking the child to come off the computer. Other common rows are about how much time is spent playing (54 per cent), the amount of money spent on in-game purchases (39 per cent) and the general bad attitude (53 per cent). A fifth of kids have landed in hot water after being found playing the game when they shouldn’t and 28 per cent have been told off for ignoring what they’ve been told to do. Seven per cent of parents have found themselves faced with a huge bill after their children racked up in-game purchases. Four in 10 parents are even convinced their child’s performance at school has been impaired due to the game and a fifth are concerned their kids think the game is more important than real life. However, six in 10 mums and dads do agree the game IS suitable for children under 16 - due to its relatively mild violence, catchy dances such as the ‘floss’ and silly, fun sense of humour. Just under half of parents like the fact the game is sociable, while 43 per cent say it’s nice to see their children so animated and excited about something.

A new study has lifted the pastry lid on the pies we most enjoy to tuck into, as well as our opinions regarding the classic pub grub staple. In terms of sweet treats, the apple pie was considered the best of the bunch. And on the savoury scale, steak and ale topped the charts, closely followed by steak and kidney and chicken and mushroom. In fact, the humble steak and kidney pie has been voted more quintessentially British than classic dishes like bangers and mash, bubble and squeak and toad in the hole.  Online casino Casumo commissioned the survey in support of their Play Absurd campaign, which sees comedian Paul Foot attempting to best the world’s fastest pie-scoffers in the Pie Eating World Championships in Wigan.    Greg Tatton-Brown from online casino Casumo , said: “When thinking about a food that Brits all love, a delicious pie is never far from the top.  “Whether savoury like a steak and kidney or sweet with a filling of apple, there are very few people who would turn down a slice of the pastry-wrapped treat. “Our survey found savoury pies are far more popular than sweet, however, which is perhaps due to them most commonly being found at football grounds around the country.” Savoury pies are favoured by 42 per cent of the population, though 44 per cent have no preference whether their pie is sweet or meaty. In order to be considered a pie in its true form the dish must have its filling entirely encased – meaning sides and a lid – in pastry, accord to three in five discerning Brits.  Twenty-seven per cent think a pie isn’t a pie unless it has a meaty filling, and one in six think there must be a rich gravy contained inside the pastry casing. When it comes to the matter of pastry, shortcrust is the variety of choice for 37 per cent of pie enthusiasts. One in four would prefer the light texture of puff pastry, and 10 per cent enjoy a flaky pastry.  The classification of the shepherd’s pie as an official, bona fide pie has long been a controversial decision, and 45 per cent of Brits say the mash-topped treat shouldn’t be considered as such. A further 21 per cent think it should be featured in the pie category, while the remaining 34 per cent couldn’t make a decision one way or the other. It also emerged the average Brit will eat three pies a month, with chips the ultimate side of choice, followed by mash, roast potatoes and mushy peas.  Fifty-four per cent have made a pie at home themselves, and most would rather suffer a burnt crust than a soggy bottom on pulling their creation out of the oven. Brits have also tried some truly bizarre pies in their culinary past, including one bought in Ecuador that contained iguana meat and another containing nettles. Greg Tatton-Brown added: “Pies aren’t just great for eating, they can make for entertainment as well – pie-eating contests take place around the world.

A poll of 2,000 cat owners found they typically have to stop their pets getting up to no good a whopping 1,350 times a year. Other cheeky acts include jumping on kitchen counters, hiding from their owners, raiding the cat food supplies and sleeping in their owner’s bed, despite it being a ‘feline free zone’. One curious cat even developed a penchant for drinking the water out of grandma\u0027s false teeth mug. Commissioned by the UK’s number one pet food brand, Felix, the research found one third have resorted to ‘cat proofing’ their homes by buying furniture covers, putting locks on cupboard doors and more. Despite this, four in 10 cat owners love their pets even MORE because of their hilarious antics. In fact, a whopping 91 per cent find it impossible to be cross with their feline friends when they do something they shouldn’t.  Toby Chelton, spokesman for Felix, said: “As the findings show, cats are inherently mischievous and get up to all sorts of antics. “You can never be entirely sure what they’ll do next, but for many owners, this is what brings a smile to our faces and makes having a cat such a delight. “To celebrate the nation’s mischievous mogs, Felix is bringing light-hearted fun and entertainment to Birmingham’s Bullring at the start of June.” The research also found two thirds have come to accept telling their cat off for being naughty won’t make the slightest difference to its behaviour. Amid this, 80 per cent consider their cats to be mischievous, with more owners from the south west calling their pet playful than any other region in the UK. And those based in the West Midlands have to stop their felines getting up to mischief nearly five times a day on average – the highest rate in Britain. Seventy-two per cent admit their cat has a habit of poking its nose into places it doesn’t belong – with the washing machine and the bath being prime examples among those polled.  But despite this, nine in 10 said their lovable fur balls have made them laugh out loud.  Carried out through OnePoll , the research also found 57 per cent of cat owners think their feline friends tend to be naughtier as dinner time draws nearer.  And almost half said their cats are such avid foodies they’ll help themselves to their owner’s dinner when they’re not looking. More than three quarters of owners said their pet has a tendency to wake up early and immediately demand food.

There are lots of rules and traditions Kate has to follow as a member of the royal family, and Meghan will now have to do the same.  One of the big no nos for Kate and Meghan, and all women in the family, is to do with their shoes.

But according to Vanity Fair she\u0027s never worn them in front her husband\u0027s grandmother.

The former Waterloo Road star\u0027s partner, Ross Blair, died last summer, three years after being diagnosed with a rare and incurable brain tumour.  He took his last breath aged 32 as the final whistle was blowing at the end of the Saturday football, after undergoing end-of-life care in a hospice .  At the time, the couple\u0027s girls, Brooke and Texas, were just six and four. Today, Ross would have celebrated his birthday. And in a moving post this morning, his brave wife, 33, described how they would have marked the occasion with their daughters if he was still alive.  She also gave advice to others, urging them to love your people hard, have tough conversations and be ruthless in what you let into your lives.  Your life is short, we die, so while you are alive, really LIVE, Holly wrote in the post, which was shared on her I am Holly Matthews Facebook page .  Ross, the son of former footballer Andy Blair, died surrounded by his loved ones last July, after being diagnosed with his brain tumour in 2014. At the time, Holly described her family\u0027s feeling of loss as unfathomable. She also said breaking the news to Brooke and Texas, now seven and five, was extremely tough, but they were all supporting each other.   In her latest Facebook post, she admitted she had had a little cry about Ross\u0027s 33rd birthday and how f***ing unfair it is on my beautiful girls.  But she added: Thankfully there are now way more good days than bad and I choose to focus on our future, whilst talking about Ross daily. Her full post is as follows: Today is Ross\u0027 birthday. He would have been 33 today and it feels insane that he\u0027s not here. We wouldn\u0027t have done anything special and I\u0027d have likely just got him a card that said, \u0027Happy Birthday Pal\u0027. He hated adults making too much fuss about their birthdays (saying they needed to \u0027get out of themselves\u0027) and a surprise party would have been his worst nightmare.  He would have joked that I was the older woman (by 7 months) and how one day he would have to trade me in for a younger model. Me and the girls would have done something with paints and stickers and came in early in the morning to wake him up with their pictures and we might have popped out for some lunch somewhere. I remember this time last year like it was two minutes ago, yet it feels 100 years ago too. Ross was in hospital, after having had a seizure and we had just got back from Turks and Caicos. So much has happened in this last year and we have all changed forever (not all bad). I have tried to stay open about everything since Ross began to get sick and in my grief and now a year on from the beginning of Ross\u0027 decline there have been many lessons.  I have had a little cry about this marker and at how f***ing unfair it is on my beautiful girls, but thankfully there are now way more good days than bad and I choose to focus on our future, whilst talking about Ross daily. I\u0027m not writing this for pity or sympathy, it just felt like a notable moment and I want you to take nothing more from this than to love your people hard, have tough conversations, be ruthless in what you let into your lives and be brave. Your life is short, we die, so while you are alive, really LIVE. Happy Birthday Rossy, pal. Holly, who has appeared in TV programmes such as Doctors, Casualty and Byker Grove, had confirmed the news of Ross\u0027s death last year. She praised the incredible staff at Myton Hospice in Coventry, West Midlands.   Speaking to the Coventry  at the time, the heartbroken actress said: “On Saturday July 29, just as the final whistle was blowing for the end of Saturday football, my incredible husband took his last breath.  “He was surrounded by me, his mum (Dionne Blair), dad (Andy Blair) and sister (Ashley Blair), peacefully and with the support of the incredible Myton Hospice staff. She added: “The loss we are feeling is unfathomable right now and breaking the news to my daughters was extremely tough, but we are supporting each other and taking it one step at a time.” Ross had undergone brain surgery and chemotherapy after being diagnosed with a rare grade-4 primitive neuroectodermal tumour (PNET).  He responded well to treatment and his tumour remained stable for two years, with him and Holly able to continue their lives as normal. The couple made many happy memories with their daughters but in 2016, a scan revealed that the property developer\u0027s tumour had grown. He underwent another second operation, where 75 per cent of the tumour was removed, followed by radiotherapy and a year of chemotherapy tablets. Again, he responded well. Last May, the family went abroad for a holiday, where Ross felt good. But just two days after they returned, he suffered a seizure. After that, Holly said his health rapidly deteriorated.

Bronte Howard says her massive debt is already more than the mortgage her grandparents took out on their three-bedroom home in the 1970s.  And the amount will continue to rise each year due to interest.  The Wales Online reporter discovered she owes \u0026pound53,409.20 after checking her student loan statement for the first time this week.  She says MoneySavingExpert Martin Lewis told her to rip up the statement, saying it\u0027s totally irrelevant and shouldn\u0027t be sent.  But she questions whether it is as simple as that. Below, Bronte writes of her shock and the advice she has been given.   Her words first appeared on Wales Online .   I’m 22 years old and I already have a massive debt hanging over me. It’s more than the mortgage my grandparents took out when they bought their three-bed house back in the 70s. I’m not a frivolous shopper, I don’t have gambling debts and it isn’t from buying property. It’s the price I - and millions of others - have paid to continue studying since tuition fees were first introduced in 1998. For those of you who were lucky enough to be able to borrow from Student Finance Wales (which I believe has a slightly better system where the Welsh Government contributes towards tuition fees, meaning students only pay \u0026pound3,000 a year) or were able to pay the fees without needing to take out loans, I’ll briefly explain how the English system worked when I took out my loans in 2013 and 2016.  I paid \u0026pound9,000 a year to study a bachelor\u0027s degree in English Language and Linguistics at the University of Sheffield. This cost me \u0026pound27,000, which I borrowed. I was also given money in the form of loans (which I have to pay back), grants and bursaries to cover things like rent, food and books. I think in total I had around \u0026pound8,000 a year to spend. Some students studying now are even worse off after the Government scrapped grants and introduced a second loan for students whose parents are on a low income. But after added interest, which started being added to the already hefty bill in April 2017, I currently owe \u0026pound42,711.43 for my undergraduate degree - a lot more than my Welsh friends. I then decided to do a master’s degree in journalism at Cardiff University so I took out a \u0026pound10,000 from Student Finance England and it barely covered my tuition fees. So I actually ended up with overdraft debt and had to rely on my parents (thanks mum and dad) and savings.  At the time, Student Finance Wales didn’t offer a postgraduate loan, so in a way, I was better off than some of my coursemates. (Although now Welsh postgraduate students are entitled to borrow up to \u0026pound13,000). I start to pay this back when I earn \u0026pound25,000 and what I pay is based on how much I earn, not how much I borrowed. But after four years of university, I now have a debt that, unless I win the lottery, I doubt I will ever fully pay back. I didn’t really think about how much I owed and I didn’t know the exact figure until a few days ago when I checked my statement online. I’d almost forgotten that I owed money because it’s almost an invisible debt. I thought it would be somewhere in the region of \u0026pound40,000 because naively, I didn’t really understand interest rates when I took out the loan at 18. It’s actually \u0026pound53,409.20 and will continue to go up each year when interest is added.   The interest rate for my postgraduate loan has also been increased to 6.1%, which is higher than the interest rate for a lot of mortgages and is probably going to go up again. So, after seeing the huge figure I asked finance expert and MoneySavingExpert\u0027s Martin what I should do. After all, it’s a huge amount of money but it doesn’t seem like anybody really cares. He said: \u0027Rip up your statement - it’s totally irrelevant - and shouldn’t be sent. Just consider that you’ll pay 9% extra tax if you earn above \u0026pound25,000. Why on earth would you try and pay it off?” When I eventually start paying the debt, I’ll pay 9% of whatever I earn above \u0026pound25,000 until the bill is paid, or wiped clean.

Dozens of social media users each day have pointed out the similarity behind ginger Prince Harry and his late mum\u0027s one-time lover, Major James Hewitt. Mr Hewitt prefers to keep out of the public eye nowadays, but has spoken out twice in the past to categorically deny being the real father of Prince Harry. During a frank and candid television interview last year, he was asked directly if he was Harry\u0027s father. Hewitt replied: No, I\u0027m not.  Pressed over why the rumours have persisted for so long, he said: It sells papers. It\u0027s worse for him [Harry] probably, the poor chap.  Hewitt began a secret affair with Diana in 1986 - which was two years after Harry, now aged 32, was born. Despite this fact, gossip mongers have continued to speculate over who Harry\u0027s father really is, given the resemblance between red-haired Hewitt and the Prince. In 2002, Hewitt told the Sunday Mirror: There really is no possibility whatsoever that I am Harry\u0027s father. I can absolutely assure you that I am not. Admittedly the red hair is similar to mine, and people say we look alike. I have never encouraged these comparisons and although I was with Diana for a long time, I must state once and for all that I\u0027m not Harry\u0027s father. When I met Diana, he was already a toddler.  It is understood Prince Charles also reassured the young Harry that he was his biological father before he started school at Eton in 1998. Supporters of Diana, including her former butler Paul Burrell, have previously spoken out in a bid to quash the rumours. And Diana’s former police bodyguard Ken Wharfe, also denied the rumours, writing: “The malicious rumours that still persist about the paternity of Prince Harry used to anger Diana greatly. “The nonsense should be scotched here and now. Harry was born on 15 September, 1984. “Diana did not meet James until the summer of 1986, and the red hair, gossips so love to cite as proof is, of course, a Spencer trait.” Hewitt and Diana began seeing each other around the same time Prince Charles was said to have begun an affair with Camilla Parker Bowles, now his second wife and the Duchess of Cornwall.  Hewitt defended his romance with the Princess, saying he could be forgiven for falling in love with her because it was so easy. Their affair was exposed five years after it started, shortly after Hewitt, a former tank commander, had served in the first Gulf War. Nowadays, the 59-year-old lives as a recluse in Dorset, but said he has no regrets about falling in love with the People\u0027s Princess. No, I don\u0027t regret that, he said last year I regret some of the things that have been caused by that but not that at all. No way.

He\u0027s also the go-to stylist for George Clooney\u0027s wife Amal and has worked with model Daisy Lowe and Myleene Klass. Today it was revealed Meghan will walk down the aisle by herself before being joined by Prince Charles roughly halfway down.  Her father, Thomas Markle Snr, is too ill to attend after undergoing major heart surgery. It is not known what designer Meghan will choose for her wedding dress. As a stylist, best pal Jessica Mulroney may well be called in to help Meghan pick out the perfect wedding gown for her big day. Meghan previously posed in a beautiful gown for Canada’s Hello magazine, modelling a gown from Jessica’s Kleinfeld Canada bridal shop. The picture was reposted last year, showing Meghan in a princess-style full skirted gown with the hashtag “Princess goals.” It could be Ralph and Russo with the bride to be wearing a semi-sheer dress with gold feather detailing and a ruffled skirt from the designer for her official engagement photos. The dress is thought to have cost \u0026pound56,000.

Will she or won\u0027t she? To promise to obey in the vows shows tradition, humility, that a bride will submit to her husband and at no point bother herself with either a dictionary or a lawyer. To omit the word indicates that dread word feminism, the even-more dread word feisty, and also regular rows which, frankly, are in every marriage regardless of who said what. So brace yourselves, tomorrow, to hear Nicholas Witchell\u0027s opinion that was to be expected, Meghan is a very different kind of Royal, but Diana never promised to obey Charles and we all know how THAT ended, don\u0027t we Huw.  It seems like every day we await the Royal wedding is another episode of the Markle Debacle, in which things do not run according to what you\u0027d expect the palace\u0027s plans to be, and therefore a little more like a normal wedding peppered with infighting, drinking and outcast relatives. The latest mismanaged news is that the bride\u0027s father, who was going to walk her down the aisle then decided he was too embarrassing then said he would and then said he was too ill and now appears to be in hospital, is not going to do it after all. Prince Charles is going to do it instead, perhaps because if there is any role he feels comfortable in it is that of an historical anachronism. But for reasons that no-one can quite fathom he\u0027s only going to walk her halfway, with the bride abandoning her mother a the door of the church and doing the first 100 yards on her own and Chuck picking her up halfway, like a last-minute pint of milk. There are three reasons for all the confusion: the Markles all seem to hate each other, the Windsors hate each other as well as everyone else, and Meghan Markle is an independent, feminist, career woman marrying into a family where she cannot be any of those things. Of COURSE the wedding is a mess.  But therein lies any marriage\u0027s biggest risk: change. It\u0027s something that\u0027s inevitable over the course of a lifetime but most of us are resistant when asked to do it in a day. When the change is moving house, a joint bank account, or parenthood it\u0027s bad enough - imagine changing every single thing about yourself, in order to join a family that refuses, under any circumstances, to change. The Meghan we were introduced to after news broke of her romance with Harry was fun. An early starter marriage, some handsome ex-boyfriends, a role in a plot-free legal drama and social media accounts that made her accessible. We saw pictures of her drinking wine, cuddling her dogs, hanging out with celebrity friends in celebrity haunts doing celebrity things. Actual photographs of her with her father, which now seems like the last we\u0027ll ever see of THAT . Meghan the charity campaigner, Meghan the Trump-loather, Meghan who smiled because she had a nice life. And as soon as Harry and her were an item it stopped. Social media accounts were closed, all socialising was done behind closed doors, the acting and endorsements ended and one of her dogs was even abandoned with friends in Canada. She\u0027s had two trips to the supermarket nearest Kensington Palace and soon stopped doing that when she was photographed picking up a loaf of bread. Some change on the part of any Royal in-law is obviously necessary - learning protocol, lowering the hemlines, being camera-ready. But what, exactly, is Harry changing in return?  Well, presumably strip billiards, racist videos and swastika parties are now off the table. But they had been put behind him anyway, so don\u0027t really count. There have been reports he\u0027s started drinking green smoothies and going to the gym, but anyone will tell you that won\u0027t last. And there is nothing else - not one single thing - that will change for Harry as a result of being married. Yes, he\u0027ll get a wife. Maybe children. But the richer, for poorer part of the vows will forever be a private joke, his work-life balance will stay the same and the chances are he\u0027ll still be shooting birds at Sandringham on Boxing Day until, and perhaps even beyond, the point he\u0027s in a wheelchair. Meghan will learn to bow and scrape, to curtsey and hide, speak through others rather than for herself and to not put on a single ounce in weight. Harry will not learn how to deal with her family, as even now they\u0027re almost all being kept locked outside the palace gates. There is no indication he\u0027ll ever meet her father, as news of it would be on a showbiz website before the text message finished its ping. His brother William managed to blend two families together when he married. Granted, the Markles are more likely than the Middletons to steal the spoons and trip over a corgi, but the entire point of marriage is taking the rough with the smooth.  It\u0027s normal to sacrifice things when you marry. Most of us are lucky if we can limit it to sanity. But Meghan seems to have sacrificed almost everything about what and who she is, while her husband has sacrificed... biscuits? The second slice of cake? How every noble of him. Meghan could, and may still be, a modernising and humanising influence on the monarchy. Much will be made of her being able to squeeze Ben E. King and Etta James songs into the wedding music. But all her independence seems, on marriage to the Royals, have been boiled down to two songs off the iPod and some finger food. Of all that we know about Meghan before marriage - AM, if you like - that is all that remains. Meghan post-marriage may still have political opinions but is forbidden from uttering them, will still have relatives but never again speak to most of them, and when we see her smile it will be because she\u0027s on camera, and not necessarily because she\u0027s enjoying herself.

And even if you’re royalty, \u0026shyproblems are hard to avoid. But all that’s behind us now and we can celebrate the joy of a new union. As gardeners, we will probably take a keen interest in which flowers will be on display on Saturday. And we may get the call to help out relatives and friends with wedding flowers. But what should you consider if \u0026shyplanning florals for the big day? Here are some of my wedding tips: An early morning trip to London’s New Covent Garden Market, in its spanking new location, may have been on the cards for Meghan and Harry a couple of months back.  It may seem like a big trip if you’re not based near the capital, but it’s here that you’ll find the best value and widest range. The merchants are helpful, especially if you get there early (6am-ish) when they have time to advise. The early bird also gets to view the full range of what’s available. Bring your wish list of florals, and photos if you don’t know the names of what you require.  The flower sellers will tell you what they should have in stock, and what will be in or out of season at the time of your wedding. You’ll also see the basics that are always \u0026shyavailable which could become the starting point for your planning. There are wholesale florist supply shops within the market, so you can use the reconnaissance trip to buy florist tape, ribbons, pins and oasis. Start thinking about vases and vessels early on. If your wedding is themed, your floral containers may reflect and enhance that concept. At the moment, hipster-style weddings are popular and native floral displays in \u0026shyminiature glass milk bottles may be your vision.  Other popular options include ultra-modern angular shapes, disco, art deco and Victorian tea room. Making an early decision about themes will help define your source. Will it be Ikea, eBay, charity shops or garden centres? Bouquets and buttonholes – if you’ve never dabbled with floral creations, make sure to \u0026shypractise well before the big occasion. Check out some instructional videos online or take an evening class. There’s a knack to creating an even composition with the bouquet and all stems pointing in the same direction. Buttonholes are easier, if a little fiddly, and can be done quite tidily with green florist tape and safety pins.  Again, grab some cheap flowers and have some practice runs. If you want to grow your own wedding flowers, this can be an immensely rewarding project. If you put in the work you will learn a huge amount. However, it may also make you \u0026shyappreciate why wedding flowers can be expensive – it takes a lot of knowledge and loads of work to deliver perfect specimens to a specific date.  Your cheapest option will be to raise annuals from seed, and there are many plants to choose from. You could sow the following outdoors now for later summer flowering. Cosmos, which produces tonnes of flowers in gorgeous shades of pinks and white, nigella (love-in-a-mist) with lovely blue flowers, Ammi majus with its lacy blooms and Larkspur can all be planted now straight into the ground. Gypsophila or Baby’s Breath is a classic wedding bouquet flower with its delightful sprays of dainty flowers and can also be sown outdoors now.  Sunflowers are easy to grow and add drama and sunshine to any bouquet. Scented flowers will give enormous pleasure so sow some tobacco flowers, Nicotiana. Queen of scent is the sweet pea – if you haven’t sown any seed, buy some seedlings and plant them outdoors now.  Your perennial borders can provide many elegant blooms – asters, astrantias, chrysanthemums, delphiniums and dahlias are all good flowers for bouquets. If you have rose bushes or hydrangeas, they will look amazing and save you a fortune! Your garden can provide much in the way of interesting foliage as well.  A big trend is to use some pot plants alongside, or instead of, cut flowers. They can be placed on tables or at the food serving tables area. They could be \u0026shyflowering or foliage, or if you want a trendy East London or Brooklyn vibe you could use some quirky succulents. Any cute pots or jars you’re using as table ornaments to sit plants into will need to be sealed (not have a hole in the base where water/soil can seep out). In that case, only slot them in that day or the day before when you are dressing tables. Otherwise they may dry out or sit waterlogged coming up to the event.

Harry and the Suits actress will tie the knot tomorrow at St George\u0027s Chapel, Windsor, surrounded by friends and family. Lucky members of the general public have also been selected to be part of the celebrations, one of the most talked about events of 2018. But who will be part of the royal wedding party? Here are the people who have been chosen to have an important role...   Will William be the best man? Prince Harry has asked his brother The Duke of Cambridge to be his best man at his wedding. William is honoured to have been asked and is looking forward to being by his brother\u0027s side. In a statement last month, Kensington Palace said: Prince Harry has asked his brother The Duke of Cambridge to be his Best Man at his wedding to Ms. Meghan Markle . The Duke of Cambridge is honoured to have been asked, and is very much looking forward to supporting his brother at St George\u0027s Chapel, Windsor on May 19. Prince Harry served as best man to The Duke of Cambridge at his wedding to Miss Catherine Middleton in 2011.  Prince William, who is President of the Football Association, will miss the 2018 FA Cup final to be at his brother\u0027s special day. Prince Harry was also best man to his brother when Prince William married Kate Middleton back in 2011. The brothers are close and William was always the obvious choice, but it was not officially confirmed until April 26. Strictly speaking, royals have a supporter rather than a best man, but the brothers appear to have broken this tradition.  Who will give Meghan away? Meghan\u0027s dad will not attend the wedding after suffering a heart scare following a row over staged paparazzi photos.  Thomas Markle, 73, was initially planning to fly to London from his home near Rosarito, Mexico, to perform the honour at his daughter\u0027s wedding. But the axe fell on this plan, with Meghan announcing: Sadly my father will not be attending our wedding. I have always cared for my father and hope he can be given the space he needs to focus on his health. I would like to than everyone who has offered generous messages of support. Please know how much Harry and I look forward to sharing our special day with you on Saturday.  It was later announced Prince Charles would give Meghan away.  She will walk the first part of the aisle with her six bridesmaids and four pageboys before meeting Charles for the rest of the way to the altar.  A statement from Kensington Palace read: Ms. Meghan Markle has asked His Royal Highness The Prince of Wales to accompany her down the aisle of the Quire of St George\u0027s Chapel on her Wedding Day. The Prince of Wales is pleased to be able to welcome Ms. Markle to The Royal Family in this way.  Meghan\u0027s mum - Doria Ragland Feminist Meghan has been keen to involve her mother in the proceedings. She will travel past crowds to the church by car with Doria Ragland , and the bride-to-be is said to be delighted. On Tuesday, the 61-year-old was picked up from her LA home and chauffeur driven to LAX airport, according to TMZ . She flew to Heathrow in London before engaging on a whirlwind of royal engagements.  These included meals with Charles and Camilla William, Kate, George and Charlotte and an audience with the Queen at Windsor Castle.   Meghan has previously gushed about her \u0027free spirit\u0027 yoga instructor mum who lives in Los Angeles and rocks dreadlocks and a nose ring. Born in 1956, Doria later became a social worker and yoga instructor in California, and the latter might give us a clue as to how she\u0027s stayed looking more like her daughter\u0027s sister. Meghan has previously opened up about her mum, crediting her with being one of the actress\u0027s biggest influences in life. She told Glamour magazine: We can just have so much fun together, and yet, I\u0027ll still find so much solace in her support. That duality coexists the same way it would in a best friend.  Bridesmaids It has been announced that Meghan will not have a maid of honour by her side on the big day. She\u0027s actually decided not to have any of her friends in her wedding party at all, and she\u0027s not having any grown-up bridesmaids. However she will be having children bridesmaids, and Prince Harry\u0027s niece Princess Charlotte will be among them.  Her other bridesmaids are: - Florence van Cutsem , three, who is Prince Harry’s goddaughter, and the daughter of his long-standing family friend Major Nicholas van Cutsem and Alice van Cutsem. - Remi Litt, the six-year-old daughter of Meghan’s close friend Benita Litt and her husband Darren Litt. - Rylan Litt, Meghan’s other goddaughter, seven, and Benita Litt’s oldest child. - Ivy Mulroney, the four-year-old youngest child of Meghan’s stylist and best friend Jessica Mulroney. - Zalie Warren, the youngest of the bridesmaids at just two years old. She is another of Harry’s goddaughters and the daughter of one of his best friends, Jake Warren and Mr Warren’s wife Zoe.  A Kensington Palace spokesman said she simply couldn\u0027t decide which of her friends to pick adding She has a very close knit group of friends and did not want to choose one over the other. There was a lot of speculation about who would take up the royal on Meghan\u0027s big day and lots of names have been thrown around in the last few months. Many believed the honour would go to best pal Lindsay Roth, as Meghan was her maid of honour when she married British accountant Gavin Jordan a few years back.  Page boys Of course Prince George, four, will be a page boy. He will be joined by Jasper Dyer, six, a godson of Harry’s and the son of his trusted mentor Mark Dyer and Mr Dyer’s wife Amanda. Former Welsh Guards office Mr Dyer has been a key father figure to the prince since childhood. Also on the list of page boys are Brian and John Mulroney , the seven-year-old fraternal twin sons of Jessica and Ben Mulroney - and older siblings to Ivy Mulroney.  Prince George and Princess Charlotte Prince George and Princess Charlotte already have one page boy and flower girl gig on their CVs - for their aunt Pippa Middleton on her wedding day last May. George did have a bit of a moment, in tears after the ceremony and with a telling off from mum Kate, but he and his little sister are now set to be page boy and flower girl for Meghan.  Princess Diana\u0027s sister - Lady Jayne Fellowes There is one person Prince Harry will probably be thinking about a lot as he prepares to say his vows - his mum. The royal couple have explained exactly how they will celebrate the memory of the late Princess Diana on their special day. Diana\u0027s sister Lady Jayne Fellowes will give a reading during the ceremony.

Newbury, in Berkshire, is home to Vodafone’s headquarters and has a higher ‘digital density’ than anywhere else in the UK, as companies seek to expand beyond London. It topped the list ahead of Reading, Basingstoke and Burnley as smaller towns build up skilled workforces to nurture new startups and tech companies. A new tech report described the ‘productivity power path’ travelling along the M4 corridor and spreading to Southampton and Portsmouth. Gerard Grech, chief executive and co-founder of Tech Nation, which compiled the 2018 report said: “This is the first major milestone of Tech Nation, the organisation now working across the country to build networks that support ambitious entrepreneurs and shine a light on the achievements of our tech sector.  “London is the world’s second most connected hub after Silicon Valley. We need to make the most of that, as our new relationship with the EU will undoubtedly force us to be even more adaptive, innovative and ambitious.” As well as the tech towns, eight cities also showed above-average employment in the technology field, with Portsmouth topping the list. It was followed by Bristol, Cambridge, Southampton and Oxford rounding out the top five. The Tech Nation report shows the UK’s digital tech sector is accelerating faster than the rest of the economy. In fact, the sector’s growth from a \u0026pound170bn industry in 2016 to \u0026pound184bn in the most recent report shows that it’s expanding two-and-a-half times faster than the rest of the UK’s economy. It also revealed the digital tech sector’s workforce is both older, and more ethnically diverse, than the average UK workplace. It showed 72 per cent of UK digital tech workers are over 35, challenging the stereotype that jobs in the sector are usually taken by millennials.

The 51-year-old said he does not blame his half-sister for getting caught up in the Hollywood lifestyle and falling out of touch. In an exclusive interview, Thomas Jnr claims the pair will always be close at heart in a normal extended family that has been pulled in different directions. And he says his father, unable to attend the wedding due to ill health, would be overjoyed Prince Charles is walking Meghan down the aisle. Ever since it started with Meg dating Prince Harry it has been a media storm nightmare for me and my entire family, Thomas Jnr told . It puts you in a different mind frame and puts a lot of stress, that you don\u0027t even realise, on you. Being photographed and followed, with your private life turned upside down, it\u0027s hard on everybody. So things get done out of frustration and you look back and you know you made a mistake.   Follow our royal wedding countdown live updates here.                The mistake Thomas Jnr refers to is an open letter he wrote to Prince Harry two weeks ago in which he advised the royal to call off his wedding. You feel like an ass about it, the dad-of-two confessed. But my true feelings are that I couldn\u0027t be happier for her. What are the odds. This is every woman\u0027s dream come true - to marry a prince. I couldn\u0027t be more happy for or proud of my sister. She\u0027s incredible. Thomas Jnr, who is in London ahead of the wedding to offer support for his sister, said his fondest memories of Meghan were actually formed during a difficult time for the Markle family. He told how caring and kind she was in the two years that followed their gran Doris\u0027 dementia diagnosis in 2009.  My favourite and fondest memory of Meghan is - well, it was an unfortunate time with my grandmother passing - but in the two year\u0027s prior to that we would spend every other weekend together, with my grandmother, and it was a very personal time, he said. She gave selfless attention and cared for my grandmother. It was incredible. Meghan would come into the room and she would light up like a Christmas tree. It was a great time because that was the real Meghan. It is the real Meghan. I will never forget it and my father will never forget it. It\u0027s very special. Thomas Jnr also addressed former claims Meghan abandoned her father and forgot about the family when she moved to Canada to play Rachel Zane in legal drama Suits.    When she went to Toronto, and jumped right into that, it was her biggest role, Thomas Jnr said. When you jump into Hollywood like that it demands so much of you it pulls you in every different direction, alway from your family and away from contact. And that\u0027s completely understandable - that\u0027s Hollywood. If you ask any actress or actor they\u0027ll do that first before anything. We still remain close at heart. If I was in Meghan\u0027s shoes I would get caught up and forget to make that phonecall. We didn\u0027t have a falling out, we always had a great relationship and I\u0027m very proud of her. I was busy in my life too and I\u0027d relocated from LA. Everyone gets busy. It\u0027s normal in our family. Thomas Jnr and Meghan\u0027s father, Thomas Markle Snr, had surgery on Wednesday after suffering a heart attack. The retired lighting engineer is reported to be awake and alert but will remain in hospital while he recovers.  This afternoon, Kensington Palace confirmed Harry\u0027s father, Prince Charles, will walk Meghan to the altar in St George\u0027s Chapel, Windsor. I think my dad would be sad that he can\u0027t be here but if there was a choice he would be overjoyed Prince Charles is there, Thomas Jnr said. As far as tradition goes, he is he obvious choice. And referring to Meghan\u0027s pre-wedding jitters, Thomas Jnr said she\u0027ll be brave no matter what. The dress is probably going to be the most stand out, one of a kind wedding dress ever made and she wouldn\u0027t have it any other way, he said. It\u0027s going to be the nicest dress anyone has ever seen - a proper princess. I don\u0027t think being that it\u0027s her second wedding dress has anything to do with it. I think this is the one that counts. This is the one that matters. Being divorced means nothing, I mean, this is the relationship in her life that counts and matters the most. So, this dress will be outstanding. She\u0027s very confident in everything she does. I think she\u0027s going to be nervous, it\u0027s the biggest day of her life. This is the one that she\u0027ll never forget. She\u0027ll be brave no matter what - she\u0027s got that down.  Thomas Jnr, who this week visited St George\u0027s Chapel and Windsor Castle, is remaining tight-lipped about his plans for the big day. But wherever he ends up, he says he will be celebrating. I wish them all the happiness in the world, he said. When she was young, dealing with my kids and the way she interacted with them and loved them unconditionally and played with them, it was very obvious she loves children. She\u0027ll be looking forward to starting her family and that\u0027s a good thing. She\u0027s going to have a great time.

Forecasters are predicting bright skies in Windsor, with up to 100,000 wellwishers expected to line the streets to mark their big day. It means people who turn out have been warned to wear sun cream and hats, with ideal conditions set to see a top temperature of 21C. The weather is set to be just right for when the newlyweds emerge from St George\u0027s Chapel before a ride around the town in the open-top Landau carriage at around 1pm. Met Office meteorologist Martin Bowles said: We are expecting wall-to-wall sunshine all day.  The beginning of the day will start off cold - around 6C or 7C - but will rapidly warm up. Temperatures will peak around 3 o\u0027clock at 21C and there will be light winds - all ideal for a wedding. The mercury is expected to have reached a summery 19C by the time the couple set off in the carriage procession. After lunch hosted by the Queen at St George\u0027s Hall at the castle, the wedding party will then move on to the evening reception at nearby Frogmore House hosted by the Prince of Wales. Once again we are expecting clear skies during the evening it will be pleasant with sunshine, but temperatures will drop relatively quickly, Mr Bowles said. At 8pm it will be around 12C, but once you get past midnight it will be 8C or 9C and minimum temperatures will again be around 6C.  The sun will set at 8.53pm on Harry and Meghan\u0027s wedding day. A chilly night is in store on Friday for any die-hard royal watchers planning to camp out in order to bag the best spots along the route. The sun rises at 5.05am however, it will take an hour or two before things will begin hotting up ready for the day\u0027s festivities. The minimum we are likely to get will be about 6C at around 6am, Mr Bowles said. That\u0027s quite cold to be camping, but there will be low winds of maybe around 3mph and no rain is expected at all.  With Windsor expected to bask in summery conditions all day, well-wishers are advised to pack plenty of sun protection. Mr Bowles said: At this time of year the sun is quite intense, the radiation is quite strong with high UV levels. People who are not used to being out in the sunshine could be at risk of sunburn so should use lots of sun cream and wear a hat and sunglasses. Temperatures won\u0027t be too high, but it\u0027s going to be warm so lots of water is good.  Elsewhere in the UK, here\u0027s what to expect: London and South East After a chilly night, people will make up to early mist, but this will soon clear. The Met Office says that temperatures will reach a maximum of 22C tomorrow, while Sunday is expected to be dry, sunny and warm.  South West There will be a cold start to tomorrow, but the rest of the day will be sunny and warm with a top temperature of 21C. Further warm sunshine is anticipated on Sunday and Monday. East Midlands People will be greeted by mist and low cloud early tomorrow, but this will make way to a fine, sunny day with temperatures of around 22C on the way. Sunday is also expected to be dry, sunny and warm.  West Midlands There will be a cold start tomorrow, the Met Office predicts, but as the day progresses it will get brighter and warmer. Warwickshire is expected to enjoy the best of the sunshine in the region. It is expected that the top temperature will be 22C, with warm sunshine set to continue on Sunday and Monday. Wales Tomorrow morning is set to be cool, but will soon brighten up, with some fair weather cloud likely to set in by the afternoon. The Met Office expects a top temperature of 21C, with further warm sunshine expected on Sunday and Monday.

All are coping with the devastating psychological impact. And while it was music that brought them together in the worst moment of their lives, on the first anniversary of the atrocity, music is helping them heal. Parents and children who were at the Ariana Grande concert, targeted by bomber Salman Abedi, formed the Manchester Survivors Choir, meeting twice a month in a church near the Arena to sing, talk, laugh and cry together. Yasmin Lee, 13, from Stockport, who suffered shrapnel injuries, says: “We were in the foyer when the bomb went off. I was blown over by the force. “It didn’t hit me until we got outside that I was injured. I rang my mum to tell her I was OK and I suddenly felt my leg burning. Shrapnel had gone through the back of my right calf. So I had to have a skin graft and was in hospital for a week.  “I didn’t process what had happened for months. It was coming up to Christmas that I realised I needed help. I’m still having counselling now. “But I’ve made friendships at the choir that I know I will have for ever. If you have had a bad week everyone understands and gives you support.” It’s that sentiment which inspired fellow victims Cath Hill, 45, and Carys Crow, 18, to start the choir. They met on a survivors’ WhatsApp group set up by the police after the attack, which killed 22 people and left hundreds more physically or psychologically injured. Cath, from Lancaster, who had taken her 10-year-old son Jake to his first concert, says: “We left from a different exit, so we did not experience seeing people dead or in great distress. But everyone was screaming and we really did think another attack was imminent.”  Weeks later they were caught up in a second terrorist incident in Cambrils in Spain. Cath says: “Jake has had nightmares, shaky legs, worrying about busy spaces. Time has helped, meeting others who were there has all helped. “We are coming together to support each other and using singing as therapy.” The choir, who star on the Manchester City United single by local band Prose, will sing at a memorial event in Man\u0026shy\u0026shychester’s Albert Square on Tuesday. Manchester Together – With One Voice will also feature Parrs Wood High School’s Harmony Group and a mass 30-minute communal singalong.  Choir co-founder Carys, of Otley, near Leeds, was at the Ariana Grande gig with best friend Ella and recalls: “We were waiting to get out when the bomb went off. Somebody shouted there was a gunman so everyone panicked, we ended up under a pile of people. “I’ve struggled a lot with anxiety. Some days you don’t want to get up because the world can seem like such a bad place. “But there are so many good things in the world, too, like the friendships and kindness that came out of it. The choir has been amazing. Now I have the choir I feel a lot safer and understood. I’m at peace.”  As Carys talks, a buffet table is being set up, with cupcakes decorated with the Manchester bee, once symbolic of the city’s industrial heritage but also a symbol of unity since the bombing. Many of the young choristers have had to cope with losing friends. Georgia Faye was at the gig with her best friend Holly but learned the next day that another pal, Georgina Callander, 18, had died in the attack. Georgia, 19, says: “It has been hard. The choir has really helped though. You never have to explain how you’re feeling. Everybody knows already.” Watching the choir rehearse, that spirit of camaraderie is palpable. Natalie Harrison, 15, of Wigan, was at the concert with her mum Melanie but they were in different parts of the Arena when the bomb went off. Melanie recalls her desperate bid to contact Natalie, saying: “I couldn’t even use my phone, my hands were shaking so much.  “There was a surge of people and after about five minutes Natalie just appeared in front of me. I have never been so relieved in my life.” Natalie says: “I get upset because I think about the people who died all the time. When I’m here it helps a lot.” Lorna Turner was there that night with daughter Ava, 11. Lorna, from Wigan, says: “Over the summer it was tough. Ava was having flashbacks. “Here at the choir we don’t always talk about what happened that night but everybody knows how we feel.” As the choir raise their voices once again, there is no doubt that they sing from the heart... “And I’ll Rise Up, high like the waves. I’ll rise up, in spite of the ache. I’ll rise up and I’ll do it a thousand times again for you, for you.”  Manchester City United by Prose, featuring Manchester Survivors Choir, is out now.      Wills to join mourners at service for Arena fallen By Stephen White Britain will fall silent on Tuesday to mark the first anniversary of the Manchester Arena atrocity. Prince William will be at a service in the city cathedral, along with Theresa May, victims’ families and emergency workers.  In South Shields, South Tyneside, shops and even the town hall will be adorned with pink and blue in tribute to local lovebirds Chloe Rutherford, 17, and Liam Curry, 19. Their families plan to stay in their home town on Tuesday, saying: “We want to spend the day here where you have all taken our beautiful, perfect Chloe and Liam to your hearts.” Another teenage victim, Nell Jones, 14, from Middlewich, Cheshire, has been remembered with a charity set up in her honour. Her brother Sam, 30, said: “There is evil in the world but there are more good people than bad people.”  Childline reported it had 200 calls from scared and anxious kids after the attack.  Band inspired by shock attack Manchester band Prose were so moved after the attack they wrote the single Manchester City United in just a day. Lead singer Mike Murray said: “At that point there were still a lot of people searching for family members and I feel like the whole city was just in complete shock.” "},{"url":null,"title":"people trolling new york lawyer","story":"NewsPeople are trolling New York lawyer who shouted at Spanish workers by sending him mariachi bands, taco trucks and piñatasAaron Schlossberg shouted at Spanish workers in a New York restaurant telling them he would call ICE to \u0027have them ejected from America\u0027\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByCharlotte Neal21:03, 18 MAY 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA lawyer who hurled abuse at Spanish workers in a restaurant is in for a surprise - people are sending mariachi bands, pi\u0026ntildeatas and taco trucks to his office.  New York lawyer Aaron Schlossberg was filmed making vile racist comments at Spanish-speaking staff and customers in Fresh Kitchen, Midtown Manhattan, on Tuesday.  He threatened to get them ejected from my country in a tantrum that has been seen online nearly six million times. Now people are responding by trolling him by sending taco trucks, pi\u0026ntildeatas and mariachi bands wearing \u0027party accessories\u0027 playing a children\u0027s song to his office. A GoFundMe campaign, set up by Mark Goldberg on Wednesday, has raised $1,094 (\u0026pound812), double its original $500 target, and an update on the page says a band has been booked.  Raising $500 to send a Mariachi band to cheer up the staff and attorneys at The Law Office of Aaron M. Schlossberg Esq. P.L.L.C. after a difficult day, the page says. We are requesting the band to sing the famous, endearing, and warm Spanish children song, La Cucaracha, the cockroach.  We are countering hate and racism with the sound of music.   Any leftover money will be used to send a delicious Taco Truck lunch to the staff and a copy of all federal and state statute mentioning undocumented immigrants do not qualify for welfare.  A series of later updates confirmed the band has been booked and said the performance will be recorded provided building security does not kick them out.  The date and time of the band\u0027s visit has not been confirmed to maintain the element of surprise. There was extra money, so party accessories and pi\u0026ntildeatas have been bought. In the minute-long clip, the lawyer can be seen practically squaring up to a man in the restaurant while saying: If you intend on running a place in Midtown Manhattan, your staff should be speaking English, not Spanish. My guess is they\u0027re not documented. So my next call is to ICE to get them ejected from my country.

Craig Mitchell, from Yoker, Glasgow, drove down to Carlisle in the North of England to get his hands on his favourite Hawksridge Cider. In Scotland, the beverage jumped from \u0026pound2.15 for a two-litre bottle to \u0026pound5.75 following the introduction of the controversial legislation.  Now, a 50p minimum price per unit is in place. The move has effectively banned cheap deals on booze in Scotland.    But Craig, 29, swerved the law by driving to Asda in Carlisle on Monday and purchasing 50 bottles of Hawksridge.  Craig spent about \u0026pound100 and saved \u0026pound180 in a purchase he described as a get it up ye to the new pricing in Scotland. It was more of a ‘get it up ye’ to be honest, he said. They can’t take our alcohol off us. I just got over the border and typed ‘Asda’ into my phone. My mate Peter has said not to worry about room to keep it – I can plonk it in his garage. Of course, the savings above don\u0027t factor in the amount Craig spent on fuel. It looks as though he\u0027s got a 4x4, so chances are he spent a good \u0026pound70 on travel. The controversial minimum alcohol pricing policy was introduced in Scotland at the start of this month after a unanimous vote at the Scottish Parliament.

In the eerie video, shot by Raul Arguello, he walks around the deserted venue in Argentina, looking for where a loud door slamming noise is coming from. The 32-year-old captures the moment he bravely shoves open the banging door to discover no one is in the brightly lit room below the bleachers in the Tom\u0026aacutes Adolfo Duc\u0026oacute Stadium in Buenos Aires. But as he pans his camera around the empty space, he unknowingly captures the fleeting instant a spectre quickly passes along the benches, crossing the video frame from left to right and disappearing through the wall. At the time, the apparition appears to be invisible to the naked eye as Arguello doesn’t react to the movement. He later admitted he hadn’t see it.  He only discovered the unnerving phenomenon hours after, when he viewed the footage and found he had apparently registered the spooky presence in the arena, which is home to Atl\u0026eacutetico Hurac\u0026aacuten, a first division club in the Argentinean championship. At the beginning of the haunted encounter the security guard explains in a voice ladened with fear, that to prove he is ‘telling the truth’, he’s going to record the baffling occurrence of the wooden door being constantly wrenched open and banged shut by an unknown force. “It’s 11 o’clock at night and it’s the third time I’ve heard this banging noise,” the frightened man says looking down into the camera while cursing his bad luck for having to face the ordeal alone. “I don’t know what’s going on but I’m going to film it to show people later on, so they believe it when I tell them because this has never happened to me before. It’s terrrifying.” Pointing his camera towards the narrow staircase leading to the dressing rooms he descends the steps with his flashlight in hand. At first the persistent hammering noise is only in the background and sounds muffled, but as he reaches the bottom it escalates into a thunderous din.

Daredevil Charlie Parker has helped his parents care for the animals at Ballarat Wildlife Park in Victoria, Australia, since the moment he was able to walk. Charlie, who has his very own pint-sized ranger uniform, held his first snake when he was one and tackled his very first crocodile just two years later. And now, in and around his time at school, Charlie interacts with the animals more than ever – and has big dreams to become a professional zookeeper like one of his idols, Steve Irwin.  Charlie told Barcroft TV: “When I interact with big animals it makes me feel excited. “I like to play with alligators, snakes, lizards and frogs. “When people see me, they’re amazed because I’m so young.” Despite Charlie being nibbled from time to time, he says that he is never scared of interacting with the biggest animals at the park. He said: “I’ve been bitten by a Blue Tongue, a snake, a crocodile, an alligator, a venomous snake that’s called Copperhead and a Black-Headed python.  “I was three when I interacted with my first alligator. It launched at me, launched at me again and then it did a big jump. It was pretty cool. “I’m not afraid of handling snakes or alligators because I’ve worked with them my whole life and I’ve built up a trust to them.” Charlie’s parents, Julia Leonard and Greg Parker, know how comfortable their son is around the animals, but they would never put him in a situation that they thought was risky. Julia, 45, said: “I certainly wouldn’t put him at risk if I thought he was going to get eaten. “Charlie can interact with most animals here at the park – he enjoys working with the penguins, he enjoys working with the mammals and mainly the reptiles.  “He’s very natural around all of them. He’s like a little David Attenborough really. “He really helps out and I think everybody appreciates how good he is with the animals.” With around 50 species of reptiles and 20 species of mammals at the park, Charlie still has his favourite animal – a giant croc called Crunch who weighs around 110 stone. Charlie said: “I like alligators because they launch out of the water. “But my favourite animal is Crunch the crocodile.”  Charlie’s father, Greg, 65, added: “Crunch is a five meter salt-water crocodile that probably weighs around 700 kilos. “Charlie respects Crunch. You know, he’s a big wild-caught crocodile and quite dangerous. “But Charlie is fairly comfortable with him. He goes in there all the time. “We’ve all got bitten fingers and a few scars over the years and Charlie is accruing a few himself. “But here at Ballarat, we believe passionately in conservation and we believe you cannot promote conservation without people meeting the animals up close.” "},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/PA-28105789-843x564.jpg ","title":"dundee announce signing of french midfielder","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee have announced the signing of a French midfielder.Elton Ngwatala has penned a deal at Dens Park and is Neil McCann\u0026#8217s first signing of the summer.The Dark Blues have snapped up the 24-year-old attacking player on a two-year deal despite interest from down south.Ngwatala previously played for Kidderminster Harriers in two spells at the National League North side.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/5afc0094a37a7-e1526475640876-928x564.jpg ","title":"dundee boss neil mccann admits hes made mistakes but looks to learn from them","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee boss Neil McCann says he had higher targets for his team this past season but insists an early start can get the Dark Blues where he wants them to be this time next year.A ninth-placed finish in the Premiership fell short of his stated top-half aim but Neil insists he learned a lot from his debut campaign as a manager.He said: “I think you have to self-analyse.“I’ve made mistakes, as a young manager I think that’s normal but, hopefully, if you’re learning from those it will put you in a better position next season.“In terms of going into the last five games, I learned a lot from my squad.“There was huge pressure going into the Hamilton game.“We knew it could have been a total role reversal and our goal difference was poorer so we knew the risk we were playing under but the players were brave and in it together.“That’ll help me 100% next season.

site","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThe first images of a “game-changing” new custody unit to be built in the Hilltown are exclusively revealed in the Tele.The Scottish Prison Service (SPS) held a consultation on its women’s community custodial unit (CCU) at the Maxwell Centre yesterday.These images were on display at the drop-in session, and SPS staff were on hand to answer questions and explain the unit’s purpose.The Dundee CCU will be the second of its kind in Scotland, following a similar unit being built in the Maryhill area of Glasgow.The facility is expected to open by 2020, and will host up to 16 inmates.Tom Fox, of the SPS, said CCUs are a “gamechanger” in the way female offenders are managed.“This will make a real difference to the lives of the women coming into our care,” he added.“There is a consensus that there are too many women in prison in Scotland.“Female offending is different (from males) – the reasons behind it are varied and complex.“A lot of the women in our care have been subjected to significant trauma in their lives, whether domestic, emotional or otherwise.“What we are trying to do is support them in a way that allows them to take control of their own lives and live positive lives on the outside.”Mr Fox explained the facility was deliberately “domestic” in design, to help it blend into the area.He said: “It will not look like a custodial facility. That is deliberate.“There will not be a big fence, but there will be a secure entry – a single way in and out. If anything, the entrance looks like a health centre.“It’s going to be staffed and have security on site 24/7. There will be shielding in the way of existing trees and additional planting. It will look like a domestic environment.”CCUs will house female offenders who are serving shorter sentences, or coming to the end of longer ones.About a third of the inmates – five or six at most – will occasionally go out into the community for work placements or activities.Some of those trips will be accompanied, while others will not but will have licensing conditions attached.Mr Fox made it clear there would be “consequences” for those who breach their conditions.Visitors will also have to abide by prison-style rules on visiting hours at the complex, which will close to the public at night, and locals will be able to call a 24-hour helpline, Prison Watch, should they have any concerns.SPS bosses hope that today’s information event will allay residents’ fears about the CCU, amid concerns about it bringing more crime into the area and denting house prices.Locals have also questioned the wisdom of placing a custodial unit next to a school – in this case, the Coldside Community Campus under construction.However, Mr Fox said that he had seen no issues in the area surrounding Cornton Vale women’s prison in Stirling – the predecessor to the CCUs.He said: “At Cornton Vale we’ve never had any problems with women going out into the community.“I also don’t think there is any evidence of facilities having an impact on house prices.“There has been an expansive range of housing built beside Cornton Vale after it was built. There’s a school beside it, which offenders walk past every day.“Do we recognise that people have concerns? Of course we do.“But letting people see what we are proposing is not what they expect is quite crucial. People get concerned when something new and unknown is proposed to them – that’s perfectly reasonable.“The fact we’re talking with the community, I think, means these concerns can be assuaged.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"wighton hopes frustrating end to campaign can spur dundee to success next term","story":"\t\t\t\t\tCraig Wighton hopes the anger at the way Dundee finished their season can spur them on to better things next campaign.A long season for most may have just come to an end with the 1-0 home reverse to Partick.For Wighton, however, it feels like it has only just begun after missing the first nine months of the term with a serious knee injury.With the manager and players alike angry at how they finished off 2017/18, Dundee’s youngest-ever goalscorer has more to be annoyed about.He said: “The frustrating thing for me, personally, is I’m just starting to get into it, starting to feel fully match fit and the season’s done.“That is frustrating but I’ll go away in the summer and work hard, come back fit and, hopefully, get a full pre-season under my belt and start the next campaign well.“Maybe Tuesday night against Ross County I got a bit leggy towards the end before I came off but I felt good again against Partick.“It was difficult, it was warm which took its toll on everyone but I feel fit, I feel good and, as I say, it’s a bit frustrating that’s the season done now.“For a lot of the boys they’ll maybe be glad it’s done because it’s been a long one but, for me, I’ve just had a pre-season!“This is basically the start for me and already it’s done which is unfortunate.”Wighton admits the performance across the board at the weekend wasn’t up to scratch.“The manager wasn’t happy and the players weren’t either,” he added.“It’s alright if it’s just not your day and you get beat but the way we played, second half especially, is not acceptable.“We weren’t at it at all.“We knew Partick were fighting for their lives and they would have a go at us but I don’t think we showed any real quality in the final third.“We were slow in possession at the back and Partick deserved the win for their second half.”The defeat echoed the finale to the last campaign – a 4-0 thumping at the hands of 11th-placed Hamilton.That stung for Wighton and he’s hoping this year’s failure to perform on the last day can niggle away at the squad over the summer break enough to spark better next time out.“Obviously, we did our business early in the split but it doesn’t mean that’s it – we wanted to win every game and four out of five would have been a good return so we are disappointed.“Last year it didn’t affect us but when you come back it’s still on your mind a wee bit, it still annoys you.“I think everyone will go away and have a good summer and next season we know we have to be a lot better.”One thing he personally is looking to add is goals – something the team as a whole has lacked in the past year.“Not taking our chances this season has really cost us.

But the Courier understands the \u0026pound370,000 art installation, still branded by Highland Council as the Gathering Place, will be divided into two sections positioned on either side of the river. The installation is thought to be a mix of stone and wooden construction.There is great excitement among city councillors who have seen two-dimensional design work, and there is apparent consensus that it is aesthetically pleasing and will easily blend into the local, tranquil environment.The \"pier\" project, proposed for a spot by Eden Court, was aborted two years ago due to the scale of public objections to the design.The location for the new proposal is believed to be nearby, slightly further upriver, at the most shallow point on the edge of the Ness Islands.The council\u0027 Inverness city committee delegated powers of approval to the Inverness city arts working group. Its current chairwoman, councillor Isabelle MacKenzie, said she had closely scrutinised the fresh concept adding that it was \"within budget\".Giving little away, she added: \"I can see it appealing to the local community. It\u0027 innovative and there are a variety of ways to use it.\"The artwork is believed to be static and radically different from the previous offering.Fellow city councillor Duncan Macpherson said: \"The whole thing looks good.

That may go on to be a great success in another city but it wasn\u0026rsquot for Inverness or the location.\"A two-day public consultation was held last December at the city\u0027 railway station and in the Eastgate Shopping Centre to gather opinions about the overall riverside arts project to consider \"how the river should connect with the people and community of Inverness\".The arts initiative has been plagued by complaints about design and costs.The council has consistently stressed that the overall \u0026pound759,000 project, featuring a range of different art installations, is publicly funded but largely through ring-fenced grants.They were \u0026ndash Creative Scotland (\u0026pound305,600), the Inverness Common Good Fund (\u0026pound281,000), the council\u0027 \"cities gateway\" initiative (\u0026pound66,000), Highlands and Islands Enterprise (\u0026pound66,000) and a further \u0026pound40,000 from the council. Backers also emphasised that if Inverness spurned the project the funding would simply go elsewhere in Scotland.The local authority\u0027 Inverness city manager David Haas said: \"It is in development and about to be revealed to the public.\"I\u0026rsquom confident the new proposal will prove a big hit for the city.
