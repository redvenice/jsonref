This is up slightly on the 16.51mbps recorded in last year\u0027s survey, which saw the UK in 31st.The fastest broadband speeds are in Singapore, which is renowned as a global technology hub. Its average figure is over three times faster than in this country, at 60.39mbps.Second place goes to Sweden, ahead of Denmark and Norway. Perhaps surprisingly, Romania comes fifth in the league at 38.6mbps, which is more than twice the speed achieved in Britain. Other poorer countries where speeds are well ahead of the UK\u0027s include Slovakia, Czech Republic, Slovenia and Andorra.The data was collected by M-Lab, a partnership between Google, Princeton University and the Open Technology Institute in Washington.It was compiled by Cable, which compares broadband speeds and services. The figures show the average global broadband speed rose from 7.4mbps last May to 9.1mbps this year – an increase of 23 per cent.By comparison, the rise in UK average speeds was just 12 per cent.          Britain has slipped four places in the world broadband speed league, leaving its network lagging well behind the likes of Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary and RomaniaThe key to achieving superfast access to the internet is a network of fibre-optic cables direct to homes and businesses – known as fibre to the premises (FTTP). This could replace Britain\u0027s old-fashioned copper wire telephone system, parts of which are more than 100 years old.At present, just 560,000 premises in the UK have FTTP connections. There are plans to reach 3million by the end of 2020 under upgrades run by BT subsidiary Openreach.Dan Howdle, consumer telecoms analyst at Cable, described the UK\u0027s position in the global league as \u0027sad\u0027.He said: \u0027Compared to many other countries, the UK has simply come too late to a full fibre solution. Despite plans to roll out FTTP to homes across the next decade or so, the UK is likely to fall further behind while we wait.\u0027 "},{"url":null,"title":"World Population Day 2018 need know","story":"Tour de France 2018 guide: What do the jerseys mean, how do the riders pee and what is the peloton?EXO emoji released to celebrate band\u0027s Twitter anniversaryBeyonce, Jay Z and Ed Sheeran to headline Global Citizen Festival in South AfricaIs Colton Underwood a virgin?

As the atmosphere turned febrile, it was suggested No.10 had enraged Mr Johnson by offering his job to Mr Davis in a desperate attempt to get him to stay inside the Cabinet, something denied by Theresa May’s aides.Allies of the Foreign Secretary insisted last night that neither this, nor leadership ambitions, was ultimately a factor in his decision to leave Indeed, when his resignation letter was finally released, it was a vivid deconstruction of the Prime Minister’s Brexit strategy. Savaging the PM’s Chequers deal, he said vast swathes of the economy would be ‘locked in’ to Brussels rules but with no influence over them.He also launched a scathing attack on the PM personally, accusing her of being ‘suffocated by needless self doubt’ and of running up the white flag to Brussels.And he warned this ‘disturbing’ opening bid could be followed by further concessions on immigration and money ‘for access to the single market’.Unlike Mr Davis – who notably backed Mrs May staying in office in interviews yesterday – Mr Johnson made no such offers of support.Mr Johnson wrote: ‘Brexit should be about opportunity and hope. It should be a chance to do things differently, to be more nimble and dynamic, and to maximise the particular advantages of the UK as an open, outward-looking global economy. That dream is dying, suffocated by needless self-doubt.’Mr Johnson said the failure to prepare for ‘no deal’ means ‘we appear to be heading for a semi-Brexit, with large parts of the economy still locked in the EU system, but with no UK control over that system.’And he condemned Mrs May’s customs proposals, the Facilitated Customs Arrangement, calling it an ‘impractical and undeliverable customs arrangement unlike any other in existence.’ In his letter, Mr Johnson accepted that on Friday he had congratulated the PM on ‘at least reaching a Cabinet decision on the way forward’. He then added: ‘As I said then, the Government now has a song to sing. The trouble is I have practised the words over the weekend and find that they stick in the throat.’Last Thursday night, David Cameron made an extraordinary appeal to Mr Johnson not to resign.The former prime minister, acting with the blessing of Mrs May, met for drinks with his fellow Old Etonian at a London club just hours before the make-or-break summit.Last Wednesday other pro-Leave cabinet ministers met Mr Johnson in the Foreign Office as details of Mrs May’s proposals leaked out. Penny Mordaunt, Andrea Leadsom, Esther McVey, Liam Fox, Chris Grayling, Michael Gove and David Davis – as well as Gavin Williamson discussed the plan.

I like that she’s still given such a classic look a contemporary twist, by wearing the bun to the side, rather than in the middle\u0027\u0027Going back to the bun is a step away from the more casual low ponytail she sported yesterday, but as that was more of a private family occasion, perhaps she felt comfortable enough to try something new – today is a day for a tried-and-trusted look that she knows will photograph well.\u0027Meghan is known for wearing her hair in a looser and more relaxed style, but her hair today is much sleeker and more elegant, with a very tight ballerina-style knot in place of her usual messy bun.\u0027 Jason added: \u0027It’s a sophisticated update on the look, ideal for such a formal occasion. I like that she’s still given such a classic look a contemporary twist, by wearing the bun to the side, rather than in the middle of her head.\u0027This look also shows the neckline of her dress beautifully she clearly likes the combination of a bateau neckline, a fascinator and an up \u0027do. All three works together beautifully and it’s a combination that looks fantastic, so I think it’s safe to say this won’t be the last time we see this look on Meghan.\u0027             The Duchess of Sussex was all smiles as she arrived at the event. To mark the RAF\u0027s centenary year, special events, activities and other initiatives at local, regional and national levels will run from April to the end of September 2018This year marks the centenary of the  Royal Air Force – the world\u0027s first independent air force – which was founded on 1 April 1918, independent of the British Army and Royal Navy.For one hundred years the RAF has defended the skies of Britain, preventing conflicts, delivering aid and combating cyber threats while working in partnership with other services.These include Operation Ruman – the UK\u0027s humanitarian assistance operation in the aftermath of hurricane Irma which hit the Caribbean in September 2017 – and the RAF\u0027s Quick Reaction Alert Typhoon Aircraft, providing a UK air defence capability 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.Today, the RAF is engaged on some 13 missions across 26 countries and is heavily committed on operations both at home and abroad.             The royals spent time speaking to RAF officials and members of the clergy before taking their seats in the church.

The terrifying moment a giant...Feline intuition: Cats at daycare center run for cover...Share this articleLeopards are solitary animals, unlike lions, and largely hunt at night to avoid competition with the so-called King of the Jungle.Because of their small size they will often drag their quarry up a tree to prevent it being stolen by other predators, which offers a clue as to where this leopard is hiding.They are similar in appearance to jaguars, but are smaller and less muscular. They also lack a dot in the centre of their spots, which is the mark of a jaguar.           The leopard is lazing in the branches of this tree, which is one of the animal\u0027s favoured hang-outs, as it keeps it out of the way of much larger predators that patrol the ground below          Even standing up in the tree, the leopard is hard to see (centre).

As the atmosphere turned febrile, it was suggested No.10 had enraged Mr Johnson by offering his job to Mr Davis in a desperate attempt to get him to stay inside the Cabinet, something denied by Theresa May’s aides.Allies of the Foreign Secretary insisted last night that neither this, nor leadership ambitions, was ultimately a factor in his decision to leave Indeed, when his resignation letter was finally released, it was a vivid deconstruction of the Prime Minister’s Brexit strategy. Savaging the PM’s Chequers deal, he said vast swathes of the economy would be ‘locked in’ to Brussels rules but with no influence over them.He also launched a scathing attack on the PM personally, accusing her of being ‘suffocated by needless self doubt’ and of running up the white flag to Brussels.And he warned this ‘disturbing’ opening bid could be followed by further concessions on immigration and money ‘for access to the single market’.Unlike Mr Davis – who notably backed Mrs May staying in office in interviews yesterday – Mr Johnson made no such offers of support.Mr Johnson wrote: ‘Brexit should be about opportunity and hope. It should be a chance to do things differently, to be more nimble and dynamic, and to maximise the particular advantages of the UK as an open, outward-looking global economy. That dream is dying, suffocated by needless self-doubt.’Mr Johnson said the failure to prepare for ‘no deal’ means ‘we appear to be heading for a semi-Brexit, with large parts of the economy still locked in the EU system, but with no UK control over that system.’And he condemned Mrs May’s customs proposals, the Facilitated Customs Arrangement, calling it an ‘impractical and undeliverable customs arrangement unlike any other in existence.’ In his letter, Mr Johnson accepted that on Friday he had congratulated the PM on ‘at least reaching a Cabinet decision on the way forward’. He then added: ‘As I said then, the Government now has a song to sing. The trouble is I have practised the words over the weekend and find that they stick in the throat.’Last Thursday night, David Cameron made an extraordinary appeal to Mr Johnson not to resign.The former prime minister, acting with the blessing of Mrs May, met for drinks with his fellow Old Etonian at a London club just hours before the make-or-break summit.Last Wednesday other pro-Leave cabinet ministers met Mr Johnson in the Foreign Office as details of Mrs May’s proposals leaked out. Penny Mordaunt, Andrea Leadsom, Esther McVey, Liam Fox, Chris Grayling, Michael Gove and David Davis – as well as Gavin Williamson discussed the plan.

I like that she’s still given such a classic look a contemporary twist, by wearing the bun to the side, rather than in the middle\u0027\u0027Going back to the bun is a step away from the more casual low ponytail she sported yesterday, but as that was more of a private family occasion, perhaps she felt comfortable enough to try something new – today is a day for a tried-and-trusted look that she knows will photograph well.\u0027Meghan is known for wearing her hair in a looser and more relaxed style, but her hair today is much sleeker and more elegant, with a very tight ballerina-style knot in place of her usual messy bun.\u0027 Jason added: \u0027It’s a sophisticated update on the look, ideal for such a formal occasion. I like that she’s still given such a classic look a contemporary twist, by wearing the bun to the side, rather than in the middle of her head.\u0027This look also shows the neckline of her dress beautifully she clearly likes the combination of a bateau neckline, a fascinator and an up \u0027do. All three works together beautifully and it’s a combination that looks fantastic, so I think it’s safe to say this won’t be the last time we see this look on Meghan.\u0027             The Duchess of Sussex was all smiles as she arrived at the event. To mark the RAF\u0027s centenary year, special events, activities and other initiatives at local, regional and national levels will run from April to the end of September 2018This year marks the centenary of the  Royal Air Force – the world\u0027s first independent air force – which was founded on 1 April 1918, independent of the British Army and Royal Navy.For one hundred years the RAF has defended the skies of Britain, preventing conflicts, delivering aid and combating cyber threats while working in partnership with other services.These include Operation Ruman – the UK\u0027s humanitarian assistance operation in the aftermath of hurricane Irma which hit the Caribbean in September 2017 – and the RAF\u0027s Quick Reaction Alert Typhoon Aircraft, providing a UK air defence capability 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.Today, the RAF is engaged on some 13 missions across 26 countries and is heavily committed on operations both at home and abroad.             The royals spent time speaking to RAF officials and members of the clergy before taking their seats in the church.

They also lack a dot in the centre of their spots, which is the mark of a jaguar.           The leopard is lazing in the branches of this tree, which is one of the animal\u0027s favoured hang-outs, as it keeps it out of the way of much larger predators that patrol the ground below          Even standing up in the tree, the leopard is hard to see (centre).

Of the 90 exhibitions that fill the city’s museums and cultural spaces, five core shows have been selected and curated by the photographer Cristina de Middel, best known for her Afronaughts series, a playful reimagining of Zambia’s short-lived 1960s space mission. In Middel’s world, play isn’t a time-wasting, puerile distraction but an essential part of creativity. It is an invitation to stop and think differently. For this show of works by Magnum photographers, Middel and her co-curator Martin Parr searched for the word “players” in the Magnum archive. The resulting images show an unexpected side of the photography agency, bringing up questions about the definition of play and how it pervades everyday life, even in times of hardship.Marking 250 years of the modern circus, this exhibition explores the spectacle and thrill of the art form’s golden age, drawing from the vast collections within the Archive of Modern Conflict. While images of elephants standing on their hind legs and lions jumping through hoops are troubling from a contemporary perspective, they stand as a reminder of how differently joy has been experienced in the past. The show traces the trajectory of the spectacular, from human cannonballs to the nuclear tests in the 1950s. Here, Middel has chosen photographers who play with notions of time, place and scientific reason in unexpected ways. AnaHell’s absurdist series Secret Friends features people in multiple locations around the world, neatly bending their bodies forward to expose their backs. A hastily drawn face and a wig instantly transforms them into comic potato-like caricatures of the everyman.A comprehensive retrospective – and the 2018 PhotoEspaña award – celebrates Nigerian photographer Samuel Fosso’s exploration of identity, gender and colonialism in the African diaspora. The exhibition title references his own extraordinary journey from his childhood in Nigeria via Cameroon to the Central African Republic where he fled as a refugee after losing his parents in the civil war. Still a teenager, he became a photographer’s assistant before going on to run his own portrait studio. Fosso’s sardonic humour shines in his early experimental work and his later stylised recreations of black photo icons.

An increase in house building would also help to bring down average prices, the IPPR said.Grace Blakeley, an IPPR research fellow and author of the discussion paper, said the government needed to wean the UK off property speculation and debt as a spur for GDP growth.She said: “Since the 1980s, the UK’s business model has rested on attracting capital from the rest of the world, which it has channelled into debt for UK consumers. The 2008 crisis proved that this is unsustainable. We need to move towards a more sustainable growth model, one built on production and investment rather than debt and speculation. “To do this we must break the cycle of ever-rising house prices driving property speculation, crowding out investment in the real economy.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7d2487a09e22dbfdf8f96f64635996d1399aa36e/0_197_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7bc9e037bffa529c6d79e6d06bf6704f","title":"starbucks introduces latte levy of 5p on single use paper cups","story":"Coffee giant first in UK to add charge in bid to cut overuse of 2.5bn disposable cups a yearStarbucks is the first UK coffee chain to introduce a national “latte levy” - a 5p charge on single-use paper coffee cups - in a bid to reduce the overuse and waste of 2.5bn disposable cups every year.Following the success of a three-month trial in London, the chain said it would roll out the charge to all of its 950 stores in the UK from 26 July.The initiative means its customers will have to pay an extra 5p on the cost of any drink in a single-use paper cup in a bid to encourage them to switch to reusable mugs or tumblers.Customers using reusable mugs already receive a 25p discount off any Starbucks drink, while those drinking in-store are encouraged to use ceramic cups.“We saw encouraging results from the first three months of this trial with Hubbub and what stood out to us was the positive response we had from our employees and customers,” said Martin Brok, the president of Starbucks Europe, Middle East and Africa.“Extending this to all our stores across Britain is an exciting step and we’re hoping this charge will remind customers to rethink their use of single-use plastic as they have with plastic bags.”Disposable cups cannot be recycled by normal systems because they are made from cardboard with a polyethylene liner that is difficult to remove. As a result, just one in 400 cups is recycled. Half a million coffee cups are dropped as litter each day in the UK.In January, MPs on the environmental audit committee called for a standard 25p to be charged on top of the price of all hot drinks bought in single-use cups amid mounting concerns over coffee cup wastage.Other coffee chains, including Costa, Greggs, Paul and Pret a Manger offer discounts to customers who bring in refillable cups, but Starbucks is the first to actively explore the impact on consumer behaviour of a charge for the use of paper cups.On Monday, Starbucks announced plans to eliminate single-use plastic straws globally by 2020, making a strawless lid a standard on all iced coffee, tea and espresso beverages. This new lid has already been launched in 150 stores across Europe, Middle East and Africa and will reach all stores through a phased rollout.The proceeds of the 5p levy will be invested in further work to support recycling and sustainability efforts with Hubbub.“Single-use plastics is an issue that has become more significant in people’s minds than ever before,” said Trewin Restorick, Hubbub’s chief executive and founder. “We look forward to discovering what more can be done to encourage people to use reusable cups.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b8bba44a06b813ac592403da51df4724e62634c3/0_282_1000_600/master/1000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=51c335f84d4ea8803ff13dcc35164356","title":"who owns the space under cities the attempt to map the ground beneath our feet","story":"The space under cities is getting busier – from transport excavations to billionaire’s mega-basements. So how to keep track of what’s down there?Just over a year ago I was sent a photograph of a tunnel-boring machine in a dirt lot in Los Angeles. The caption read: “Elon Musk is about to start digging.”The message was from Wayne Chambliss, a geographer in southern California, who tends to be prescient in such matters – and indeed, Musk’s freshly minted Boring Company soon set its machine loose, ripping through the subsurface soil under the SpaceX headquarters in Hawthorne to create a short tunnel. This pet project – to test a private mass-transit system based on Hyperloop technology that would magnetically propel small pods and cars through LA’s underbelly – has now become a serious challenge to the famously traffic-snarled city’s failure to create viable public transit. The company’s website suggests “roads must go 3D” and Musk has stated “in theory, you could have hundreds of levels of tunnel” as more thoroughfares are required. As so often with Musk’s projects, the company is treating subterranean space as a tabula rasa – or in this case, tubula rasa – to be played in for profit. Indeed, in most major cities, just as you can’t expect commercial planes to stop flying over your house through aerial highways, you also can’t prevent public transport routes being dug out underneath it. Outside Melbourne, Australia, for example, the government is currently preparing to bore underneath 260 properties – including more than 100 homes – to build a road tunnel. Homeowners received a letter explaining that their “sub-stratum” land was being sequestered – without compensation. In London, a city with 150 years of trenching, digging and boring to its name, the chaos is reaching new depths. According to Newcastle University’s Global Urban Research Unit, more than 4,600 basements have been granted planning permission in the last decade – in just seven of London’s 32 boroughs. The space under London is now getting so busy that the Ordnance Survey, Future Cities Catapult and the British Geological Survey have joined forces to create a new initiative called Project Iceberg, which will attempt to aggregate cities’ subterranean data. In London it will include transport tunnel information, geological records and maps of 1.5m km (0.9m miles) of underground utilities and four million kilometres of telecommunications lines.Los Angeles does not have the same degree of vertical complication as a much older city like London, and the city council seems to be tentatively backing Musk’s new private transit tunnels. But Musk’s vision of underground dominance presents us with another thorny problem: what complications arise from passing the underground into the hands of private industry? And should the state be allowed to cede subterranean land to a billionaire to build a private transport system?Historically, the foundation of property law in the US and UK was enshrined in the Latin phrase “Cuius est solum, eius est usque ad coelum et ad inferos” – which roughly translates as: “Whoever owns the soil, holds title up to the heavens and down to the depths of hell.”Subterranean scholar Dr Marilu Melo of the University of Sydney explains that not all countries behave this way. In Mexico, for example, “property rights are effectively superficial, they do not extend volumetrically into the earth,” she says.Even in places that have traditionally been ardent defenders of private property, however, once human beings took to the air and started tunnelling underground, the old heaven to hell ideal began to require caveats. In Australia, although pre-1891 land titles went “to the centre of the Earth”, those issued after 1891 extend down just 15 metres (49 feet). The new Melbourne tunnels will edge right up to this legal vertical limit.“Land prices tend to force private construction downwards, especially where there are planning limits on upward expansion,” says the Ordnance Survey’s Rollo Home.There has been a growing concern in London over “iceberg architecture”, where the volume of subterranean expansions can quickly eclipse the “host” architecture in size. The Newcastle researchers separate the London basements it studied into what sounds like fast-food drink sizes: “standard”, “large” and “mega”. In the “mega” category, they found that on average owners pulled almost 1,700 cubic metres of dirt from under their houses. Many of the basements contained cinemas, gymnasiums, pools, wine cellars and panic rooms. One even included plans for a subterranean beach with an accompanying waterfall. Kensington and Chelsea and Westminster councils have now taken steps to curb the maximum depth of such projects. The Ordnance Survey has suggested that £5.5bn ($7bn) is spent every year on exploratory excavation just to figure out what’s underground, and according to a 2013 Mayor of London report, £150m of damage is done every year to underground utilities because of a lack of information. Underground urban planning of an extension of a tube line, for instance, requires knowledge of where sewer and water systems, electricity and utility tunnels, bunkers, foundations, basements, cellars, vaults, passageways, archaeological remains, data centres, basements, and other transport tunnels are located. Most cities have a “dial before you dig” hotline because there is no central holding place for data about underground space. Enter Project Iceberg. The goal is to serve as a repository for data on all of these underground elements, from which a comprehensive visualisation can be built. The resulting map would need to be an all-inclusive spatial database, but how volumetric cartography might look is not yet imagined. It could perhaps be something like Bruno Imbrizi’s real-time 3D tube map that went viral in 2013. Or the framework could feed an augmented reality engine, so that aiming a phone camera at the ground would reveal what is underneath. Singapore, Helsinki and Hong Kong are model cities for developing underground masterplans – and it is no coincidence that tightly controlled and regulated cities hold better data in this regard. Private developers digging and burrowing into cities like Los Angeles and London make this immensely more complicated – as does the need for secrecy on many underground projects. The underground is, after all, where we hide things. When Westminster tube station was built, much of it had to be “planned by omission”, a guide told me. Engineers would submit plans and the government would send them back with suggestions for different routes – refusing to explain why. Land registry data later confirmed what anti-secrecy journalists like Duncan Campbell had suspected all along: the existence of a network of covert tunnels connecting government buildings in Westminster. The government, in short, wasted loads of public money denying the existence of something that it had secretly spent a great deal of public money building in the first place. Further clandestine excavations spring to mind: tunnels under borders used to smuggle people and contraband shipping containers stockpiled with food buried in the wee hours by doomsday preppers. Given London’s history of furtive diggers – like William Lyttle, the Mole Man of Hackney, who burrowed under his house for 40 years – it doesn’t seem a stretch to imagine a TfL boring machine punching through the side of a fallout shelter dug without permission. Although it is an open project, Iceberg researchers have suggested creating a hidden vault layer in the 3D map, where secret data could be locked away from general view. Yet as was clear in the Westminster example, the absence of data is data in a comprehensive archive. Given this, both governments and criminals who wish to keep their underground infrastructure under wraps may find it difficult to do so in the coming age of volumetric transparency. We have little virtual privacy left within decades, all spatial privacy may evaporate, too.The US government has been trying to map the subsurface of the Earth from outer space, by measuring differences in the gravity field at the Earth’s surface. An Air Force project undertaken more than 20 years ago on a tunnel in Texas was able to capture “reasonably accurate readings of the tunnel’s size, shape, variable depth, and orientation”, as Chambliss told attendees of the recent annual American Association of Geographers conference in New Orleans. This could soon enable a planetary-scale survey of the underground, revealing new tunnels, bunkers, silos, and compounds. His recommendation to the assembled geographers: “Dig now.”Many are. In Sweden, which already has 65,000 known shelters for a population of just under 10 million people, the government has begun building new bunkers. Seoul in South Korea has more than 3,000 large public shelters. In the plains of Kansas, I recently visited two cold war-era Atlas intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) silos being redeveloped into “Survival Condos for the wealthy. Meanwhile, the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (Darpa) is currently funding a “subterranean challenge”, soliciting bids for techniques to enhance “situational awareness” of global underground spaces, with a $2m prize. The challenge is to create machines that can make their way through tunnel systems, urban undergrounds and natural caves. Robots will need to climb, crawl, squeeze and sense their way through these environments, with an eye towards future use in dangerous or hostile underground environments that human bodies can’t access. These robots will effectively become our subterranean avatars, and their deployment will mean that there really is nowhere left to hide.“If we are to take control of the subsurface, we need to have an holistic view of the subsurface,” says Home. But who is to wield that control? For almost 200 years – since Marc Brunel’s invention of the tunnelling shield, which protects workers as they inch forward during excavation – human beings have almost exclusively excavated using money from the public purse. Only two years ago, for example, more than £9bn of public money was used in Switzerland to tunnel 35 miles through the Alps, down to depths of almost 2.4kms.Underground has long been a space of public investment, communal infrastructure, exploration and, when required, secret assembly. In many ways subterranean environs have been more democratic than the surface of the Earth, as depicted in Gabriel Tarde’s 1896 utopian novel The Underground Man, in which in which people not only survive but thrive after a “fortunate disaster” forces human kind to burrow. But as we rush to render our underground world in three dimensions, increasingly it appears we are backing – tacitly or otherwise – private ownership and comprehensive surveillance. The mayor of Chicago, Rahm Emanuel, has just handed Musk’s Boring Company a contract to build a Hyperloop to shuttle people from O’Hare International Airport to the city centre. Although Musk’s company will build the tunnel, the city will own it and lease it back to Musk for use, and Musk has also stated that (unlike in Melbourne) no land will be seized to build it. Both sound like good caveats, but neither dilute the fact that this will be a private, for-profit, transport system – not public transport.Just like our drone-filled skies, the undergrounds of the future appear to be just another territory for the rich and powerful to colonise the rich and powerful , a process that may replicate and compound the inequalities of the present. This may be cause enough to throw a wrench into Musk’s tunnel-boring machines. Metaphorically speaking, of course.Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, or explore our archive"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5f9f7a8bf9b9fb08819fab7139d76c14f7ff59e1/0_53_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=845d7f917eedbd82b4f1cd0f37ed9251","title":"denmark ghetto laws niqab circumcision islamophobic","story":"From a niqab clampdown to circumcision debates, my country is becoming explicitly IslamophobicDenmark has just passed a law called the “ghetto deal”. This awful word is used in all seriousness to describe 25 residential areas across Denmark, where a significant proportion of the inhabitants have an ethnic-minority background andor low social status.I often visit friends in some of the most well known of these areas around Copenhagen, and I have seen nothing but children playing football, mothers with baby carriers, bored young boys hanging out and old men playing chess under the trees. These are tidy, well-kept and homely places, very far from the depressing image the word “ghetto” brings to mind.Crime rates have actually dropped sharply in the areas in the past few years, but from now on, sentences for crimes committed in these areas will be twice as high as elsewhere, and now a whole family can be thrown out of their home if one of their children commits a crime. The children in the “ghettoes” will get special attention that other children apparently don’t need. All one-year-olds will be given 25 hours a week of mandatory daycare, which will include an education programme, and pre-school children will be given language tests (which they can fail).How did we come to this? The Denmark I grew up in was based on a humane, inclusive attitude, where equality was a goal, and social problems and crime were met with professional support, rehabilitation programmes and education. The supposed “ghettoes” are a result of a policy where even citizens with a low income should still have a home of good quality, with social activities built into the neighbourhood. It’s quite logical that ethnic minorities tend to end up in these places, as they rarely have other options to start with.During the last decade the Danish perception of equality and social support has taken a surprising turn. My friends from the Middle East, Asia and Africa do not qualify as my equals any more. A new term, “non-western immigrants”, is being used as a euphemism for Muslims. “Non-western” is somehow used to imply people who are backward, traditionalist, violent, criminal, lazy and non-democratic, with cultures that suppress women and children. And the government is constantly busy designing new laws that only target them – last year the proud integration minister, Inger Støjberg, celebrated with a cake when she reached the first 50 restrictions for foreigners.Our open-minded, tolerant tradition is now being used as a weapon against “the ones who don’t respect our values”. All of a sudden, we think it’s very important that Denmark is a Christian country (as opposed to Muslim). And every time the word “migrant”, “foreigner” or “refugee” is mentioned, the same sentence is sure to hold several of these words and terms: “crime”, “terror”, “Islam”, “insecurity”, “economic expenses”, “demands”.The issue of foreigners is the top priority of all political parties, in spite of the fact that very few people are asking for asylum at the Danish border these days. When the refugee wave was at its highest in 2016, Denmark gave asylum to 7,400 people, equivalent to 1.3 per 1,000 inhabitants.The focus has shifted from integration and inclusion to a new strategy of keeping migrants out. First: tell them they are not welcome. If they don’t listen, try to prevent them from entering by introducing some of Europe’s toughest requirements for asylum and family reunification. The few ones who slip in anyway are no longer entitled to the same social benefits and rights as Danes, as they had been before. And we don’t want them to stay, so the demands for permanent residency and citizenship have been made almost impossible to meet. This also helps to keep them out of the democratic voting procedure. There are serious discussions about mandatory serving of pork in state institutions whether bus drivers are able to drive safely during Ramadan fining the 40 women who wear a niqab for doing so and we consider banning circumcision of boys (Jewish people caught up in this are simply collateral damage).In contrast to all this, most Danes actually like their “non-western” neighbours. New refugees still tell me they feel welcome, with Danes helping them in their struggle with the language or finding a job, inviting them into their home. This is the paradox of Denmark: a hostile government policy apparently supported by a majority of the people, combined with a generally positive atmosphere towards the inidual immigrants that we meet in our day-to-day lives.• Michala Bendixen is head of Refugees Welcome Denmark and editor of refugees.dk"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7866715299805fd8dd8facb781fa5ab75e233ecc/0_243_3328_1997/master/3328.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=76e8a05f5125355645db5b9819b1fbf2","title":"justin timberlake review o2 arena london","story":"O2 Arena, London Some scoffed at his Man of the Woods project, but its country-soul proves a classy way for the Tennessee boy to enter the next phase of his pop careerBeing in a boy band might be the time of your life, for a while, but after a few years the whole thing starts to look like a parable for human mortality. Sure, your voice might endure, but your body won’t keep dancing like that, and your fans will only ever  a single generation like an iPhone or David Davis, obsolescence is built in.So, what if you do want to keep dancing? It’s the conundrum facing Justin Timberlake, 37, whose time in boyband N*Sync was followed by a hugely successful and credible solo career that has faltered a little of late with 2013’s bloated The 2020 Experience and new album Man of the Woods, lampooned by critics for his anti-metropolitan switch from suits to plaid. The album’s rural concept is spectacularly, faithfully, even pedantically realised on stage. While some stars are content with a little catwalk and cursory acknowledgements of the cheap seats, Timberlake draws together the whole arena via a snaking path dotted with trees, a patch of retractable grass and a fully working, presumably gas-driven campfire at the opposite end. The latter is used for a good ol’ singalong with his backing vocalists – real-world campfires feature earnest Australians doing Jack Johnson, but here we have melismatic takes on Lauryn Hill and Fleetwood Mac.Man of the Woods’ country-soul turns out to be an astute, classy option for any ageing male pop star. The title track, rather corny on record, becomes endearingly light-hearted – you could imagine Candi Staton doing a good cover – and the magnificently robust single Say Something will endure long into any future world tours. Drink Me Away though, a 2020 track that sketched out Woods’ path, ends up dragging out to at least 10 minutes long, what with Timberlake’s insistence on taking a shot with his band while hollering “It’s coming home!” and name-checking Kane and Maguire in perky American-cockney. Other parts of the set take in Timberlake’s previous generational shift: the funk revue of The 2020 Experience, essayed by his tight, cacophonous band the Tennessee Kids. This mode is less successful, pummelling the minimalist grooves out of Filthy, LoveStoned and Señorita, though the sheer showboating chops of the two drummers and the lead guitarist are undeniably riveting. Timberlake shows off his own musicianship, playing acoustic guitar, organ and, most compellingly, a sampler, triggering a bright funky collage of his own vocals to introduce My Love. Powered by the set’s strongest hooks, the band’s maximalism suddenly delivers as they segue into Cry Me a River and Mirrors for a dizzyingly uplifting climax. It’s a reminder that one of Timberlake’s best contributions to pop is his brand of power ballad: propulsive and gospel-infused.His other USP, of course, is his dancing. A mix of Michael Jackson, boy-band aerobics and the jookin style of his native Tennessee, his trademark style is one of tight robotic gestures. In his youth he looked possessed by these moves now there is the less exciting sense that he is now in control, with just a tiny hint of rust. But when he gives himself to jookin, tracing golden ratios with his feet, he’s mesmerising, and there’s a nod to contemporary styles with a burst of rapper BlocBoy JB’s hopping “shoot” moves. Age has perhaps withered Like I Love You a little, Timberlake now unable to give it its malevolent erotic urgency. There are no screaming girls in the audience, only screaming women back in touch with their girlhood. But no matter: Timberlake is finding clever new ways to be a pop star as he begins to contemplate middle age. The plainly euphoric closing number Can’t Stop the Feeling is a case in point: with the tempo slightly relaxed compared with his earlier work, along with his shoulders and hips, it feels perfectly in tune with today’s Timberlake. Pop lifes be damned – the boy is still determined to dance, dance, dance."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7b5853b66aa8d5622a6c54f1e806601a72e3b1d4/0_0_1200_675/master/1200.jpg?w=1200\u0026h=630\u0026q=55\u0026auto=format\u0026usm=12\u0026fit=crop\u0026crop=faces%2Centropy\u0026bm=normal\u0026ba=bottom%2Cleft\u0026blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly9hc3NldHMuZ3VpbS5jby51ay9pbWFnZXMvb3ZlcmxheXMvZDM1ODZhNWVmNTc4MTc1NmQyMWEzYjYzNWU1MTcxNDEvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc=\u0026s=a01edf818f336d97f1461b15dd863d57","title":"casey stoney no bigger club than manchester united","story":"The former England international has a grand vision as first manager of United’s women’s team“I think this club has the ability to change the face of women’s football.” That is a bold claim but, coming from someone with the playing career and influence of the proponent, it feels very believable.Less than a year ago the England defender Casey Stoney was pulling on a Liverpool shirt having joined the club from Arsenal the previous December. Now, she is sitting in Manchester United’s impressive Carrington training ground preparing to lead their long-awaited women’s team into their maiden season. It seems a quick turnaround and, for Stoney, not one she could have imagined: “Not in my wildest dreams, to be honest,” she smiles.It has been a whirlwind. Following Phil Neville’s appointment as England manager Stoney was approached and, after hanging up her boots in February, she joined the national team set-up as his assistant. However, when the United recruitment process opened, she knew she had to apply: “I had to put my name in the frame and give it a go because I knew if I had turned down the opportunity, then it might not have come again and there is no better. There’s no bigger club to work for so to be head coach is probably the proudest moment of my career.”Employing someone to lead such a high-profile side into the new second tier (Women’s Championship) months after she retired from playing may seem a bold decision but Stoney’s appointment is anything but: “You go into any job and you’re going to have self-doubt. Of course you are but I back myself. I’ve been coaching 17 years, I’ve coached full-time, it’s easy to forget we’ve only been professional for four or five years.”In fact the former Lioness’s record off the pitch speaks for itself: “I’ve worked full-time at the Beckham Academy, I’ve worked with under-18 boys’ teams, been head coach at lots of Centre of Excellence teams, been a player-manager with no coaching staff and no infrastructure. That was one of the hardest things I’ve had to do, at 25.”With 130 caps Stoney is used to the senior England set-up but joining Phil Neville’s staff, albeit briefly, gave her a different look at managing at the top – “I worked with the best players in the country, therefore my standards and attention to detail had to go up” – and, when she approached him about the opening at his former stamping ground, Neville was always going to be on board. “He loves this football club his son’s here now as well. He knew it was the right opportunity for me and was very supportive,” says Stoney.The 36-year-old has had a rich playing career, working with a number of well-respected coaches and their influence runs through her own coaching style in different ways. “Hope Powell is a fantastic coach and she demanded an awful lot in terms of standards on the pitch. Keith Boanas, too, who I was with at Charlton, was also a fantastic coach and really helped me at a time when no one else believed in me.“That care aspect I’ve taken a lot from him. Under the shirt is a person you’ve got to get to know them, what their aspirations are, what support network they have? He was a big influence on me. And obviously working with Phil, I took away the bits he brings from the men’s game. I’ve learned an awful lot about the slight differences, the standards, the detail within a session, the rhythm when you’re on the pitch.”Her own style is changing all the time but she has already established what she expects: “I’m not a dictator, that’s one thing I say to the players. I like them to have freedom but within a framework. They need to know the guidelines and rules. I’m also big on balance. They need to have a life outside football. I want my players to be happy but I want them to be challenged, so I will stretch them and put them in uncomfortable positions because I think that’s how you develop them as people too. I expect high standards because that’s how I was as a player and that’s who I am as a coach.”Having been involved in women’s football for almost 25 years Stoney has seen many clubs and many changes within the game. United joining the party is something she is convinced will transform women’s football. “I can honestly sit here and tell you that I’ve never been at a club where the level of detail and standards are so high,” she says.“They want the team to be successful and they want the players to have the best opportunity to be able to develop.”The FA’s restructure of women’s football has ided opinion. However, Stoney is supportive of the changes and what they mean in the long term: “United got in because their bid was good, very good. They didn’t get in at the expense of anyone else, other teams didn’t get in because their bids weren’t good enough. Why would you not want Man United to have a women’s team? With the fanbase, the global reach, the way the club do things and the potential to grow the game? It is a no-brainer.”Stoney is delighted to have been given the freedom to build from scratch: “The club have trusted me to know the women’s game better than they know the women’s game. I know every player in this league, every player in the league below, internationally I know a lot of players too and I like to think I’ve got a good relationship with a lot of them. It means players are signing for me, as well as all signing for the club.”Rumours of the group that make up her newly assembled squad are flying and, with the announcement due on Friday, the wait is nearly over. Stoney travelled widely to meet her targets and knew from the off what type of players she wanted: “I’ve gone for character, talent and winning behaviours. They’re the three things that drove my recruitment.”She has picked a squad that reflects the “exciting and entertaining” way she wants to play: “We’ve gone young, we’ve gone exciting, we’ve gone entertaining. I’m more than aware that we’re bringing 21 strangers together and that in itself is a massive challenge especially in the first year but I’m really excited about the squad I’m working with.”With pre-season two days in, the fun has started and, with no pressure from the club for immediate results, Stoney is bound only by her own ambitions: “There’s no pressure from the club. United have said you don’t have to go up. The club want to build slowly. There’s no timeline. Our legacy, and I said this to the players, is to ‘make sure my two little girls grow up wanting to be you’.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ea2aa80374a76e8fb2ab5f8218fc190fbf7bcb0/232_20_1568_941/master/1568.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b809fce578b0a0e73ff0b740e16f4091","title":"england players fitness peaking world cup john brewer","story":"John Brewer, who worked with Bobby Robson at Italia 90, thinks the team are reaping benefits of Gareth Southgate resting playersLions in the winter, lambs in the spring. Until this World Cup the truth of Michel Platini’s decades-old verdict on England’s footballers had continually hardened, like gum left on the pavement. Not this time, though. Against Colombia Gareth Southgate’s side were pushing forward in the dying embers of extra time, the sniff of glory in their nostrils – and they were the stronger side facing Sweden in the quarter-finals too.It might come as a surprise that this prowess is not reflected in the sort of physical stats beloved of TV producers. When it comes to average distance run at this World Cup, for instance, England rank 10th according to Fifa while for high-intensity sprints per match they come 15th – good, yes, but not exceptional.Yet those inside football say focusing on such numbers misses the point. “Total distance is nonsense, both from a theory perspective and an applied research perspective,” warns Ted Knutson, whose consultancy StatsBomb works with several leading clubs across Europe. “Teams probably run a lot more when they are out of position regularly.”Knutson’s data also allows him to examine how many times a team pressures an opponent – defined as closing down an opposition player in a way that forces him to make a quick decision. But even here England do not stand out. Belgium’s players have pressed the ball an average of 215.2 times a game during the World Cup France 201.6 Croatia 175.4. England, meanwhile, are 29th in the World Cup on 153.But, Knutson points out, England have had the majority of the possession and not been behind – except in that strange semi-friendly against Belgium – so they have had little need to harass opponents continually. Hence those numbers.Meanwhile John Brewer, who was England’s sports scientist at Italia 90, when they last made a World Cup semi-final, says it is more important to focus on ‘subtler’ signs that show England’s high levels of fitness.“I remember having conversations with Charles Hughes, who was the Football Association’s director of coaching back then, and very much about high-tempo football,” recalls Brewer, who was one of six backroom staff Bobby Robson could call on. “He was obsessed with sprint intensity and fitness. But I would endlessly say to him it’s not just about running around like headless chickens. It’s about having the fitness to implement your game plan, recover between matches and sustain your level over multiple games. And that is what we are seeing with this England team.”Brewer also believes Southgate made the right decision in giving his players a break after the season, as well as resting most of his first choice XI against Belgium to help them recover for the knockout stages. “The more subtle indicators of fitness are also evident with Southgate’s England,” says Brewer, a Pro Vice-Chancellor at St Mary’s University. “You see it in the way players can sustain their coordination, touch and cognitive decision-making over 90 or 120 minutes – because when people are tired those abilities tend to plummet.“You could even argue that in previous tournaments with England that it was sometimes fatigue that played a part with missing crucial penalties.”Despite England going out to West Germany on spot-kicks in Italia 90, Brewer recalls the tournament with pride and speaks highly of the players and Robson. But things, he stresses, were very different back then.“Players used to love eating steaks before matches, which was clearly not ideal,” he says. “I tried to implement a culture shift in favour of more carbohydrates to give them the energy they needed, with a certain amount of protein too. But one time the England doctor, John Crane, brought out a big trolley load of steaks and announced: ‘You have got to give the boys what they want.’ But Bobby Robson’s reaction was: ‘No, you haven’t. You have to give them what they need.’“There were issues with alcohol too,” he adds. “We had a ban on booze from two weeks before Italia 90 but what Bob did a couple of times was allow them to break the curfew with a drink or two of wine or champagne. But unfortunately there were situations where some players drank far more and that caused a couple of issues.“However the players who had played in Europe already, such as Gary Lineker, Trevor Steven and Chris Waddle, got it. I remember Chris saying to me that what I had been doing with diet and preparation was totally accepted in Europe and that we were still lagging behind other countries. You can’t say that any more.”It would be ironic, of course, if England made the World Cup final in the year the Premier League finally agreed to have a winter break. But Brewer still thinks it is worth implementing – providing players are able to rest rather than go off on a lucrative tour to the Far East in January.He is supported by Luis Suárez, who in his autobiography writes that it is not the number of games in English football that is the problem but their intensity. After arguing for a 15- to 20-day winter break, he wrote: “If you compare the intensity of the Bundesliga, La Liga and the Premier League you can see that the English league’s harder.”Perhaps on occasion, though, the lack of break has been used as a crutch to explain poor England performances. Raheem Sterling, Kyle Walker, Dele Alli and Jordan Henderson played substantially more minutes this season than they did before Euro 2016 – and all appear to be thriving in Russia.Meanwhile, whatever happens in the coming days, Brewer urges clubs to be sensible when England eventually come home. “The players have done wonderfully well,” he says, “but they have been on the go for nearly 12 months. They are playing in some of the most highly pressurised games in their careers. There is a risk of burnout if they, and their clubs, are not careful.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1557e5f7fb3b7db388e7b0e267868563f31831ce/0_218_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cb50fc49daa6d6e217c042cb90738c48","title":"england world cup run football consumers","story":"The woman who lives at No 42 says she knew, just bloody knew, that Eric Dier was going to score his penalty as soon as he stepped up to take it.

It was 30C in London last Saturday but felt hotter, like “the sun was a huge fifty-cent piece that someone poured kerosene on and then had lit a match,” Richard Brautigan wrote, “and said, ‘Here, hold this while I go get a newspaper,’ and put the coin in my hand but never come back”. Everything is a little woozy and delirious and feverish and a bunch of nutters have invaded IKEA and the Band of the Coldstream Guards are playing that song at Buckingham Palace and no one’s entirely sure whether this is actually a dream maybe. It just might be. It has all the logic of one. Has anyone checked to see if the spinning top’s stopped?They say 24m watched England v Colombia, 19.6m England v Sweden. These are the days when everyone’s a football fan, when, ahem, journalists who haven’t written a word about the game in the last decade shamelessly decide that it’s suddenly time to start. It’s a strange business, right now, writing about any other sport, like working in a bookshop that refuses to stock the bestseller everyone’s reading, a butchers that only serves imitation meat, “see it bleeds pink just like the real thing, it’s the beetroot juice that does it”. The World Cup’s an indubitable reminder, if anyone needed it, that England is a football country that plays at other games.Was it always like this? Flick back to the ’s Monday edition on 30 July, 1966. Mary Peters broke the national record in the women’s shot put that weekend, at a little meet in Kingston before the Commonwealth Games. England’s lawn tennis team thrashed Ireland 8-3 in Scarborough. Derbyshire were bowled out for 157 in Southampton. The British \u0026amp Irish Lions beat Auckland 12-6 in New Zealand. Great Britain \u0026amp Ireland won the St Andrew’s Trophy in Bilbao, and lost the Curtis Cup in Hot Springs, Virginia.  carried long reports on it all. And they ran half a page of football, too. Well, England did win the World Cup that Saturday.The match only just made the front page, in a single column down the left-hand side, all about how the players would share a £22,000 bonus despite the Wilson government’s wage freeze. The lead story was the latest development in the Nigeria coup d’état. Skip ahead a generation to 5 July, 1990, and England’s defeat by Germany in the semi-finals shared the top billing with a story about the poll tax. Inside, the match coverage filled a single page, the same as Goran Ivanisevic’s run to the Wimbledon semi-finals and only a little more than the news that Phil DeFreitas wasn’t going to play the third Test against New Zealand.A generation on again, and England’s World Cup run has become so utterly irresistible that other sports are contorting their schedules just so everyone involved can get it all over with in time for kick-off. There were emergency committee meetings in the cricket leagues last week to rush through agreements about early starts and extended tea-breaks for last Saturday’s matches.Gloucestershire and Kent have brought their Wednesday T20 game forward to 3pm. Yorkshire – intractable, obstinate, old Yorkshire Cricket Club – have kicked their match against Derbyshire into another week altogether.They had the football up on the big screens at Silverstone, too. Wimbledon, so sure of its status, is the one to hold out. They refuse to show anything but tennis. Whisper it, but when he was first told that the men’s final was likely going to clash with the World Cup this Sunday, one of the All England Club’s officials is supposed to have said, “well, why can’t they move theirs?” The club has a Tory minister’s gift for reading the public mood. Never mind that the tennis players themselves can’t stop talking about it, that Kyle Edmund said how happy he was to wrap up his Tuesday match early because it meant everyone could go watch the football.So there were a lot of empty seats on Centre Court on Saturday, which, the club insisted, were “a consequence of people taking natural breaks between matches”, natural breaks that just happened to overlap with the time it took England to go 2-0 up. Seems that scared the club into making one concession.They’re now going to allow fans to watch the game on their mobile phones. There’s no competing with the football, after all, no resisting its spread-through-the-admass culture. We’re all football consumers now, so best just give in and go along. This country needs something happy to shout about right now, after all."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cc4363029cacbba26e5cddb68360a8d3a11c7bb0/0_200_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=87a7567d8f6d139bfd97940c6f583e2d","title":"england world cup success for many not few","story":"Olympic Games in 2012 did not produce a legacy of a healthy nation but investment at grassroots could take off after RussiaCast off that final layer of scepticism, ignore the fear of jinx, forget the bruises of the past. It is time to think the delightfully thinkable.As England’s footballers prepare for the epic final knockings of Russia 2018 there is already a feeling of wider forces at work, of spectating on a small but significant peg in the shared cultural history.The players will return in glory whatever the bounce of the ball against a high-class but tiring Croatia. A semi-final is a spectacular achievement in itself. On the other hand we have the nuclear option. This England team is more than capable of winning two more matches from here and becoming unexpected but deliriously received world champions.At which point it is perhaps time to think a few slightly less thinkable things about victory and medals and what sport is ultimately for.What would England winning the World Cup really mean? To use a classic press conference formula: what message would this send out? Or if you really want to know where this is going, what would it mean for England – the Fat Man of Europe land of under-geared school sport and falling participation but a place where professional football is brilliantly managed – to win the World Cup?And yes, everyone knows this is not the moment for this, that it is instead the moment for cheers and beers in the air, for sucking the sweetness from the spectacle. As indeed we will. As a wise man once said, I’m happy for you, Imma let you finish.But there is also a disjunct that will be felt by many. On one hand elite English football is as well-run and managed as it ever has been. The Premier League is a wonderful product. By the end of the week England could have world champions at senior, under-20 and under-17 level. The people responsible – the coaches, players, parents, those who have helped through the levels – are an inspiration.But this is also a split sporting universe, a place where a World Cup win should not be seen as an end point or as proof of good health in all other areas.What is the value of a medal? It is a question familiar to anyone who has studied the last six years of Olympic “legacy”. Great Britain basically won the Olympics in 2012 and 2016. Look at the medal table. One anomalously small, quite unhealthy nation occupies second and third place, wedged in between the super states.The athletes and coaches and funding bodies played this beautifully. Their medals are a profound achievement. But they have very little to do with the everyday sporting experience of the British people. Outsiders looking at “Team GB” in action might have thought, wow, this country really does have a wonderfully thrusting and healthy outdoor culture, so many people taking part, such a vibrant wealth of grassroots rowing and pommel-horsing.In reality we are more than ever a nation of sedentary sofa-bound consumers. Take your pick of the culprits: lack of facilities, inactive parenting, selling-off of playing fields and the scandalous death of sport in state schools.Either way there are fewer people participating in sport now than there were before the 2012 Games.This is not football’s fault. Football does not drive bad diet and an indolent culture. Plus of course football is not the government, or Sport UK, or your parents. It is a business responsible only to its employees and shareholders.And yet it isn’t, is it? Look at the happiness England’s success thus far has brought. Look at the energy here, the goodwill. This passion has been exploited brilliantly by football’s commercial arms. But it needs to be fed too.But there is good news too. The Football Association is aware of this. The plan to sell Wembley to fund grassroots football is so wonderfully sensible it still inspires a double take, although it is vital this is done properly.At the same time the women’s grassroots game is flourishing, or in other words taking up a shameful amount of slack. The Premier League is also stepping up, committed to doubling its grassroots investment to £100m a year. This trickle down will have some effect.But what is striking is how entirely unrelated this is to the professional game. We have a distinct two-tier system here. The current England team reflects the successful Team GB methodology, with a similar set of processes to those used in elite rowing and cycling.Pluck out the right kind of malleable talent. Then create a kind of uber-culture with its own sealed space. Even Gareth Southgate’s selection reflects this. The players are athletic, young and intelligent. Nobody smokes or booze-binges. Nobody is a difficult physical type. Within this, England have sweated those dear old marginal gains, engineered a genuine team culture, become supremely well organised.It is brilliant work, tribute to the skill and thoroughness of the manager. But it is a self-contained achievement, one that reflects also the culture of the Premier League academy system. This is a micromanaged world, with talented kids extracted as young as five and kept distinct, nourished and coached away from schools and clubs where habits are bad, pitches are poor, coaching dad-level.The success of England’s junior teams suggests the academies are getting something seriously right. And good luck to them. But when it comes to World Cups and shared glory it is worth recognising this system is not an expression of national good health, some vital piece of municipal planning or political will. It has nothing to do with football your children will play, the access they will get to facilities, the camaraderie and pleasure and good health these things can bring.This is not, for example, Iceland, where TV revenues went into building an all-weather pitch in every school and into the building of indoor arenas where local people get to use the same professional facilities, a genuine shared national success. For England, reaching a World Cup final would mark this year and this giddy, fun summer in the popular culture for ever. Probably we are already there with a semi-final. Hug your neighbour. Give thanks for Lord Gareth and his coat of the waist. But there is also a chance here to use all that energy and pride and unity in other ways.There will be no shortage of people looking to borrow the glow of England’s success. Political capital will be sought. The value of the product will be boosted. Yet more money and interest will gush in. Does elite football really need a new car or a larger mansion?How refreshing if some wider idend could be reaped, with a little extra provision to help protect our green spaces, fit out our rundown parks, to cut ticket prices for younger fans to see these England players in the flesh, to rejuvenate the greybeard support.Most of all, those in power could do something about school sport, reinserting it into the day, training PE teachers, giving the girls and boys inspired by seeing this on their television a nudge that they can get out there and do it too.Recent history offers us a guide. Great Britain won the Olympics in 2012 and 2016, then lost them in the years that followed. With this World Cup England has a chance not just to win the war, but also the peace that follows."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/16482e7454089c26d91ed7bbf2e73ac1d22f6632/80_141_4533_2719/master/4533.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=03d8d9418ce96289284e106c5cc9c177","title":"marouane fellaini paul pogba france belgium world cup","story":"The World Cup semi-final between Belgium and France will see a clash of two giants who play for the same team, Manchester United, and have impressed in RussiaThe France-Belgium World Cup semi-final on Tuesday is one the whole world is looking forward to. Two teams full of talent and a 1998 world champion on each bench – the France manager, Didier Deschamps, and our old friend Thierry Henry alongside Roberto Martínez with the Belgians.Many eyes will be on them. But once the preparation is over and the final words pronounced, it is over to the players and one of the big clashes will be between two big players in midfield. Big in every sense of the word. Paul Pogba is coming up against his Manchester United team-mate Marouane Fellaini.I admit I have been surprised by Fellaini. He was not in the starting lineup at the start of the tournament but he has forced his way in. The way he plays allows Belgium to free up Kevin De Bruyne and that is the solution that Martínez seems to have settled on.It makes sense, especially when you look at the way De Bruyne played against Japan – when he was supposed to share defensive midfield responsibilities with Axel Witsel. If you look closely at Japan’s second goal against Belgium you will see Witsel scuttling from one opponent to another to try to prevent Shinji Kagawa getting into a shooting position while De Bruyne is literally barely even walking, just a few metres away, looking on like a spectator.I am sure that was the moment Martínez realised the idea of having De Bruyne in that position was not going to work. Fortunately for him and for Belgium, De Bruyne played a major role in the winning goal in that game but by then Martínez had already brought on Fellaini and the big man had scored and added a real presence alongside Witsel.Tactically Belgium look much better balanced with Fellaini in a holding role and I thought he had a really good game against Brazil. He is a much better footballer than many people think and maybe the way he has been used in recent times at Manchester United has not helped him. I remember games with Everton when he was more of a playmaker, very much at ease with the ball at his feet and the game in front of him. He knows how to drift between attack and midfield and he has a very good conservation of the ball – Brazil never found a way round him and he has quick feet for such a big player. He has had to simplify his game, a little similar to the way Pogba has had to rein in some of his attacking instincts for the good of the team.Fellaini’s work rate and tactical nous gave De Bruyne licence to roam against Brazil, the United man helping the City player to be able to exploit the spaces he needs to link up play and create danger. Pogba, too, has been impressive in the way he has adapted his game since the start of the World Cup. I wrote previously here about how he needed to control his natural exuberance for the good of the team and I think he has done this remarkably well in the last two games.Very intelligently he has understood that France can count on the attacking wiles of Kylian Mbappé and Antoine Griezmann to unlock games and that his role, therefore, is to provide balance alongside the tireless N’Golo Kanté in the midfield two. I have really liked what I have seen from Pogba in the games against Argentina and Uruguay – a tactical maturity allied to his natural talent. Simple passes when the situation called for it against the Uruguayans and long, raking ones for Mbappé to chase against the Argentinians.Playing against your club team-mate for an international match, or vice versa, is a rather strange situation to find yourself in. Fellaini and Pogba may come face to face during this semi-final and it could be a real clash of the titans. But they will not be the only ones in that situation. Kanté might well find himself keeping a close eye on his Chelsea team-mate Eden Hazard and, who knows, perhaps Olivier Giroud will have to take a penalty against Thibaut Courtois.These things happen sometimes and it is not always easy for the players. I have two good examples: I can remember a Premier League game between Arsenal and Chelsea in which Thierry Henry was giving me a hard time. He scored a goal after shrugging me aside and I felt a need to react. I went up to him after the goal celebrations had died down and calmly suggested he switched flanks because I was getting a bit annoyed and I did not want to run the risk of injuring him.It is a natural reaction from a defender – you want to make your presence felt, particularly when you feel as if you are in difficulty. Anyway, he switched flanks and that was the end of that. But, generally, on the field you have to try to forget that you are friends.Thierry will be on the Belgium bench for this semi-final with France. Naturally it is strange for us to see him on the other side but I have no problem with that. He is working, he has a job to do. It must be tough for him being on a mission to help another country beat France but I respect the fact he is just doing his job. And, as far as I know, nobody offered him a similar job with France, so there you go.Coming back to the teammates situation, here is one more tale. In recent weeks in France there has been a lot of talk about 1998 because of the 20th anniversary of our World Cup victory and that reminded us all of the penalty shootout against Italy in the quarter-finals.At the time a lot of people were surprised to see the two youngsters, Henry and David Trezeguet, stepping up and scoring, particularly because Youri Djorkaeff, our main star alongside Zinedine Zidane, did not take one. But Youri was a teammate of Italy’s Gianluca Pagliuca and, as he told the guys who made the recent documentary film looking back at 1998, the Internazionale goalkeeper had been saving all his penalties in training! I hope Giroud does not find himself in a similar situation against Courtois on Tuesday night."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1a44c24413a3af07f3bc5bfefb6731d82729e88f/0_29_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ea9990eca3019e088787387a9538b5a2","title":"why the nation fell for gareth southgate","story":"Pick a moment. There have been so many from which to choose in this unexpectedly joyous World Cup. Harry Kane’s stoppage-time winner against Tunisia. Jordan Pickford’s penalty save against Colombia. Eric Dier’s winning shootout spot kick moments later. Harry Maguire’s towering header in the quarter-final. Kyle Walker and Jesse Lingard dancing like idiots in front of the fans.But there is one that sticks out above all others. One so iconic it could be eclipsed only by Kane lifting the trophy in Moscow on Sunday. It came after England had just won its first ever penalty shootout in a World Cup. Having congratulated his own players, the England manager, Gareth Southgate, took the time to seek out Mateus Uribe, the Colombian player whose miss had set up the victory, and put an arm round him in consolation.This wasn’t just a random act of sensitivity and compassion – though these qualities are sufficiently uncommon, not just in English football but football the world over, to have made them remarkable in themselves. It was one of empathy. It was Southgate’s missed penalty against Germany that had been England’s downfall in the 1996 European Championship. He knew what it felt like to be the man to dash a nation’s dreams. To have been the man who ended up as the fall guy in a Pizza Hut advert. His arm round Uribe’s shoulder wasn’t a casual, passing gesture: it was one that spoke of a deep personal understanding.Even more than that, though, it was a moment of grace. Life is a messy business that offers few obvious chances at redemption. Failures and disappointments are generally rewritten or absorbed into lives that somehow muddle on as best they can. Southgate was granted a Hollywood sense of closure. The opportunity to channel his own experience of despair into one of triumph for his team, in front of a global audience of roughly a billion people. From zero to hero.As Dier’s penalty went in, England went noisily bonkers. What the country had learned from the 22 years of pain since last winning a penalty shootout (against Spain in Euro 96) was that the right reaction was to shout loudly, get pissed or drive around the streets leaning on the horn. What Southgate had learned from the whole experience was a basic sense of decency. That night he showed a nation how to behave. Small wonder that the few remaining people who weren’t already a bit in love with the England manager collapsed happily into his embrace at that moment.It was never intended to be this way, though. After all, it had been Sam Allardyce entrusted with the job of England manager after the country’s disastrous showing in the 2016 Euros. Then he was accused of offering businessmen advice on how to “get around” the rules on players’ transfers and using his role for financial advantage – Allardyce continues to deny the allegations. Given England’s performance in Russia, we should profoundly thank the Daily  for the investigation. Southgate, in charge of the England Under-21 team at the time, was a hastily appointed replacement and dismissively referred to as the “caretaker manager”.No one expected much of Southgate. Not even the Football Association, whose chairman Greg Dyke said in 2016 that English football was in such a desperate state that no one should dream of any real success until the 2022 World Cup, at the earliest. Southgate, notorious for missing a penalty and being sacked as manager of Middlesbrough, was just there as a stopgap. Expendable collateral damage in the seemingly futile search for English football’s lost soul.Even in the runup to this World Cup, the expectations remained at rock bottom. Normally in the buildup to a major tournament, the media quickly reaches fever pitch with unrealistic hype about how the team could finally end X years of hurt, only for the headlines to become increasingly bitter – with the manager and players turned into laughing stocks when the dreams go unrealised.This time, nothing. Nada. It was almost as if everyone was fed up with football. The manner in which Russia had become the host nation still stank, fans were advised to stay away due to threats of violence and Putin’s repressive regime and no one – even in jest – seriously expected England to have a prayer. After decades of lost hope, pragmatic despair had set in. This was a tournament to which we already knew the ending. England would do well to make it out of the group stages. And, if they did, they would lose on penalties in the first round of the knockout matches. It was written in the stars.All of which suited Southgate just fine. He had never been one of the headline-grabbing egomaniacs who have dominated football for much of the past 30 years. He knows there is more to life than the game and has created the space for himself to spend plenty of time with his wife, Alison, and their two children, Mia and Flynn. So, he was more than happy to slip under the radar and set about creating a team in his own image.In the past, England has seemed like a team in name only. A two-tier collection of so-called stars, such as David Beckham and Wayne Rooney, with random iniduals making up the numbers. No wonder they struggled. Southgate has made a virtue of a necessity – England is, thankfully, completely out of big-ego players right now – and picked a squad where Harry Kane is the only player to even be the biggest name at his Premier League club. And even he looks like someone who is simply thrilled to be part of the England setup and not someone who is doing his country a favour.Southgate is blessed with the rare gift – in football, especially – of emotional intelligence. That is what makes him emblematic of a modern, outward-looking man. He trusts his players. He encourages them to take responsibility for their own actions. He helps them to tell their own stories. To be known both to themselves and those around them.All year, left-back Danny Rose has been suffering from a depression which he had kept to himself after picking up an injury: Southgate helped him come to terms with it by going public (“England has been my salvation and I can’t thank the manager and the medical staff enough,” he told the press). It was as close to therapy as football gets. By acknowledging the possibility of failure, he has made success more likely. The ball of fear that had hung heavily over the English game has been lifted.Better still, Southgate leads by example. He doesn’t just talk the talk, he walks the walk. He believes in the importance of family and encouraged Fabian Delph to return home for the birth of his child. The player missed the team’s winning match against Colombia, but was back in time to come on as a subsitute in Saturday’s quarter-final against Sweden. A World Cup may come around again, but to be present at the birth of your child is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Southgate is an open book and takes responsibility for his own actions. Previous managers might have thrown a strop and blamed somebody else when a sheet of paper, which appeared to contain some tactical notes, found its way into the hands of the press before the Panama game. Southgate took the hit, said the media were just doing their job and moved on. What could have slipped into the familiar them-and-us siege mentality between the players and the outside world was instead instantly defused.Everyone in the squad knows their place and understands their role within it. Fielding a near-second-strength team for the group match against Belgium was an act of insight and inspiration. Not because losing guaranteed England a place in what looked to be the easier side of the draw, but because it offered clarity to the rest of the squad. They knew they had been given a chance to make their claim for a place in the regular starting 11, but they hadn’t been good enough to take it. Southgate had demonstrated his even-handedness and that he didn’t have favourites. Too often in tournaments, the reserve players can become disaffected and undermine the unity of the whole squad. Now, there is a genuine sense of togetherness. Success may breed its own success, but it was Southgate who lit the spark.And it’s not just a team that Southgate has inspired. It is England as a whole. At a time when the cabinet is fighting like rats in a sack, and trust in the political class to act in the best interests of the country rather than their own party is at an all-time low, Southgate has shown what it is to have integrity. To stand up and be counted.When a large number of people in the country are obsessed with who is cheating on whom on Love Island, he has demonstrated that you can act with humanity and decency towards others. He has shown us who we could be. A better us. A nation that can look triumph and disaster in the face and treat them both the same. (Though also a nation that is getting decidedly used to dealing with the triumph and would rather not have to think of the disaster for a while yet, thanks.) Football may be coming home, but Gareth and his team get to stay in Russia for another week yet."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f7c8dccdfb1780486a9a250432a901b09a42207d/0_101_1091_654/master/1091.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f001c392524dafdb1ee55fea45bb349c","title":"world cup fiver france belgium bobby m","story":"Sign up now!

A local derby between Bobby M’s brilliant Belgium and Diddy Deschamps’ dazzli … erm delightf … um … decent France. And like a mind-altering David Lynch film, there are more subplots than The Fiver’s frazzled little brain can cope with.Chest-control’s Marouane Fellaini can be expected to boot his strutting Manchester United teammate Paul Pogba around St Petersburg for 90 minutes, while Olivier Giroud will continue his existential crisis up front for Les Bleus in the cold and lonely but ever so important Stéphane Guivarc’h role. Meanwhile, N’Golo Kanté will use his 12 lungs to follow Chelsea colleague Eden Hazard’s tail around the pitch in an impromptu replication of a Charlie Chaplin chase scene. And then there’s the small matter of Bobby M’s vibes man, Thierry Henry. The World Cup-winning teammate of France boss Diddy who will be shouting “Va Va Voom!” encouragingly at Belgian players instead of French ones. “It will be bizarre to have him up against us,” pouted Giroud. “He is a living legend of French football. He has given so much to the France team and we have got a lot of respect for what he has done. But of course I would be proud to show ‘T1ti’ that he has chosen the wrong camp.” To do that Giroud might have to score a goal or have a shot on target, something he has failed to do in 412 minutes of World Cup football. Not that Diddy gives a flying one. “He might not have the flamboyant style of other players but the team needs him in each and every match because even if he does not score, he does many things for us,” he shrugged.The Fiver can understand why Henry would choose to cosy up with Bobby M instead of Diddy. Like an overbearing parent, Deschamps doesn’t let his players anywhere near the throttle. It now seems clear that Kylian Mbappé went rogue against Argentina, revving the engine to Diddy’s dismay. Meanwhile, the former Plucky Wigan and Everton boss comes across like a slightly eccentric fun uncle, the type who would laugh loudly as he lets you juice his motorbike down a massive hill even though there was a very big chance you could end up smashed to bits.Bobby M has also been busy singing a redemption song in Russia, having been somewhat ridiculed when he was kicked out of Goodison Park for his naive tactics. But after Belgium cruised through their group, roared back against Japan and out-thought Brazil, perhaps it’s time to give the genial Spaniard a tip of the hat. He’s even made a West Brom player look good. Give him the World Cup NOW! It’s coming home all right. To Bobby M’s house, in Wigan.

It is disrespectful to authority. Unpredictable. Maybe the craziest tournament, ever. Being a football expert, I thought England were too young, too unexperienced, too predictable in their 3-5-2 lineup to do well in Russia. So I bet against them in their games against Colombia and Sweden (the later no doubt influenced by an Italy-playoff complex) and watched on as I got both predictions completely wrong.To the delight of every English fan, I am not going to change my policy ahead of the semi-final. I know Harry Kane is the best striker in the competition, Dele Alli a shining star and Jordan Pickford an underrated keeper, but I admire Ivan Rakitic and Luka Modric too much not to think Croatia are slight favourite. So, can England win the World Cup? Sure they can. Will they win the World Cup? Probably not. Next to the other three teams in the semi-finals, England cannot compare in terms of technical ability, control, experience and attacking flair. Instead they are well organised, tough to beat, competitive and certainly one of the best around for scoring goals on set pieces. They are also learning fast for a such a young squad and now know now they can win games on penalties, which could prove useful against Croatia.However, the easy part is over for England – their only real test so far has been Colombia – and the question now is whether or not, with the heat well and truly on, they can beat Croatia and go all the way. My answer? Probably not. I predict a France versus Croatia final.England impressed me even before this World Cup with their success at Under-17, Under-19 and Under-20 level, so much so, in fact, that I flew to St George’s Park to discover the secret to the country’s success. The former Germany and Liverpool midfielder Didi Hamann accompanied me and after the trip we both felt strongly that something special was happening in the country. England have strong, young players who play refreshing football and, in that sense, the squad reminds me a little of Germany’s at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa. They too reached the semi-finals before losing against Spain, the eventual winners. England face Croatia, a team also full of experience, so it will not be easy, but England have four things to their advantages: they showed against Colombia that they can win a penalty shootout they showed against Sweden that they can win in a routine, professional manner they have the best striker in the world in Harry Kane and they have a really impressive goalkeeper. So they could go all the way.England’s success in Russia might look like chance to some, but it is not. Gareth Southgate has clearly worked hard to build a team that has a well-organised and structured defence a midfield that is based more on work than creativity and a forward line which is fantastically efficient. It is a young team that still finds it hard to be patient with the ball but make up for that with very good work on set plays and has a big advantage over Croatia: their legs. After two consecutive periods of extra time, will Zlatko Dalic’s men be able to keep up with the pace of the young Englishmen? It’s very possible they will not be and tThat is why England could well get to the World Cup final and well go on to win it. Juan I Irigoyen (El Pais)England have a great chance of winning the World Cup – in four years’ time. Gareth Southgate has made a lot of progress as head coach, developing an exciting team that is enjoyable to watch and quite Brazilian in their style a gifted goalkeeper, attacking full-backs, a classic defensive midfielder, a pair of strong wingers, and a player in Raheem Sterling who has the talent to represent the Seleção right now.But England have also shown during this tournament that they can be really nervous in their play, holding onto the ball for too long and not passing confidently. They have also engaged in acts of simulation that would make even Neymar embarrassed.That is England’s problem – they lack conviction in their style of play and this is why I can’t see them winning the World Cup this year. But if they stay on the path they have been travelling under Southgate they can definitely do so in Qatar in 2022.When it comes to England and sports you close your eyes, remember the smell of humid grass and remember it is the nation where football was born. It is also a nation that has gone 52 years without winning the World Cup and is desperate do so again. Can they do so in 2018? Well nothing lasts forever, not even droughts. Years of watching great players perform in the Premier League have clearly had an affect on the national team with the most clear one being that England no longer play like they used to. The current team is more interesting and dynamic, and in that sense they have betrayed themselves, as Spain did a decade ago.The players also appear to be mentally stronger and it could be that more than anything else that carries them past a strong Croatia team and into the final."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/970cecd18c601dfa5a12eac61dabc3a64f539639/0_371_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1497b6b00da7f995344d959260259a82","title":"world cup 2018 buildup to france belgium plus england latest live","story":"Today’s World Cup Fiver has landed!

Simply click below for guaranteed* FUN and confirmation that FOOTBALL’S COMING HOME**.* not guaranteed** to Bobby M’s house in Wigan... and now some proper news. It would seem Croatia defender Domagoj Vida is doing his level best to ensure that any Russian fans in the Luzhniki Stadium tomorrow night will be supporting England. Here’s Shaun Walker, our Central and Eastern Europe Correspondent, with the story.Croatian defender Domagoj Vida continues to court controversy, after a second video emerged of him chanting pro-Ukrainian slogans. Fifa investigated the first video, recorded after the quarter final win against Russia, in which Vida shouted “Glory to Ukraine” and former international Ognjen Vukojevic said “This victory is for Dynamo (Kiev) and for Ukraine”. Both players used to play for Dinamo Kiev. Tensions between Russia and Ukraine remain high since the annexation of Crimea and Russia-backed war in eastern Ukraine.The phrase “Glory to Ukraine” is a nationalist greeting that has become widespread in Ukraine since the Maidan revolution of 2014.Croatia’s football federation sent Vukojevic home as a result of the incident and apologised for the statements, which they said “were in no way intended to have political connotations, yet which unfortunately left room for such interpretations”. Fifa gave Vida a warning. Overnight, a new video surfaced in which Vida, appearing to swig from a bottle of beer, again shouts “Glory to Ukraine” and also “Belgrade is burning”! The video sent social media into overdrive, but appears to have been made a long time prior to the World Cup, and possibly to refer to a bar in Kiev called Belgrade, where Vida was a regular during his time at Dinamo.Thanks to Alex. And I’m back just in time for some big BREAKING NEWS: “Around a dozen” England fans travelling to Moscow have been spotted in dark-blue waistcoats. Yes the rolling blog has come to this. The fans were clocked brazenly boarding planes at Heathrow wearing their clothes, and news organisations were duly informed. A spokesperson for Marks \u0026amp Spencer confirmed the garments might have been purchased at one of the company’s stores, possibly, sort of: “Gareth Southgate’s sideline style has meant our waistcoats are really scoring with our customers, with sales doubling since the World Cup began.” More on this developing story when we have it.And before I hand back over to Scott, a thought: perhaps the one story running through all four of these semi-finalists is the rehabilitation of the “meh” manager.Until this summer, Roberto Martínez was the wide-eyed gung-ho merchant who took Wigan down and couldn’t get Belgium to add up to the sum of their parts, Didier Deschamps was sneered at for making Europe’s most thrilling squad into a team of safety-first chuggers, Zlatko Dalic’s biggest achievement outside Saudi Arabia and the UAE was winning the Albanian Supercup a decade ago, and Gareth Southgate was stranded in age-group limbo at St George’s Park having underwhelmed emphatically at Middlesbrough.Today, Belgium are in the semis thanks to Martínez’s tactical masterstoke against Japan and his crafty outmanoeuvring of Brazil. Deschamps has finally forged a system that lets Paul Pogba shine without halting his electric attackers. Dalic has Croatia partying like it’s 1998, and Southgate has solved three decades of England’s deep-seated tactical, technical and psychological deficiencies with a mere swish of his wand.Bravo all round, chaps. Except, of course, there’s still time for them to make tactical chumps of themselves on the very grandest stage there is. We await in earnest. Ta-ra – and back to Mr MurrayIn no one’s getting carried away news, I solemnly report that – deep breath – Gareth Southgate’s waistcoat is being sought by the Museum of London for its permanent collection. “Waistcoats were born in London in 1666, promoted by King Charles II,” enthuses the museum’s very own Indiana Jones, curator Beatrice Behlen. “The new fashion soon spread and for at least 300 years a three-piece suit soon formed a key part of every man’s wardrobe. “Now Watford-born Gareth Southgate is reviving that London tradition and bringing waistcoats home to the forefront of fashion.” And back in the real world – or at least, the world of club football – the coming season holds the exciting and long overdue prospect of a Manchester United women’s team. Casey Stoney, she of 130 England caps and 10 major trophies, will be in charge and our reporter Suzanne Wrack has been to speak to her. Unsurprisingly, she has plenty to say.Read it here:Tomorrow’s Big One will reunite Dejan Loren with his old foe from last season, one Harry Kane. You might remember that match-up didn’t go too well for the Croat back in October of last year – he was hauled off after half an hour having given a masterful demonstration of “the art of un-defending”, as our own Barney Ronay put it.Kane – the Golden Boot glowing alluringly in his sights – will fancy his chances, then. Except Lovren’s quietly splendid return to form since then may mean things aren’t quite as simple as that. Here’s what Lovren himself has to say on the matter:England’s swaggering march to the last four has been marvellous on many levels, not least as it has brought with it an outpouring of Italia 90 nostalgia. Here’s two highlights of the ballooning genre: The great Matthew Engel on that summer’s tears, penalties and how he realised his country had changed for ever while taking out the bins:And here’s Louise Taylor on the man in the dugout that day, and how Bobby Robson’s wonderful legacy leads directly to a certain waistcoated wonder:Test your brainpower with this quiz on the four semi-finalists’ squads: While we’re talking stats, here’s a few regarding the physical prowess of Gareth’s Boys. Our man Sean Ingle has crunched the numbers, and the man who was England’s fitness coach at Italia 90 reckons the signs are promising. And it’s not all cold, hard data – there’s wistfully boozy tales of Lineker and Waddle in there too:Afternoon all. Let’s kick off with a stat:Faintly astonishing, that, and I’m sure you’ll agree it represents a significant blemish on what is supposedly the World Cup of “shithousery”. Time for the players to up their game. Although tonight’s tie, mouthwatering as it certainly is, is more so for its attacking talents that any potential nark. That said, as long as Marouane Fellaini’s Elbows remain in this tournament, there is hope – and of course, World Cup semi-finals involving Croatia have a strong history of contentious sendings off for violent play.It’s almost as though I was killing time until lunch. So with that, I’m off to lunch. Alex Hess will be your guide I’ll see you again very shortly.He’s bringing FootballBack. Justin Timberlake has hitched his carriage to the England love train, leading a chant of “It’s coming home” at his O2 Arena gig last night. Stopping short of a full blown Lightning Seeds medley, he instead segued into a passable impression of a cockney soccer fan: “Go on then Kane! Go on! Go on then Maguire! Come on!” Three Lions is on course to reach number one again this week, 22 years after it came out. 22 years! Timberlake’s 37 and all. Anyone else feel so very old?A couple of hours ago, Gokul Kannan compared the current England team to India’s t20 cricketers of 2007. Josh Gill thinks there might be an even more appropriate sporting analogy: the 201718 Philadelphia Eagles.A team that finished bottom of their ision the last time around. A group of mostly young players, talented but not household names, built around a young superstar-in-the-making. An unfancied coach famously described by one pundit as the “least qualified in the last 30-years”. Not the worst team around, but certainly nowhere near title contenders.But they won hearts and minds with their social awareness, and won games with a sense to family, togetherness and joy. Finally, they brought a trophy back to a city that hadn’t seen a championship win since the Sixties. Everyone went berserk, climbed lamp posts, and caused mild amounts of criminal damage. Surely England’s parallel success is written in the Stars (and Stripes?)“What would England winning the World Cup really mean?” Barney Ronay poses the question. Or, more specifically: “What would it mean for England - the Fat Man of Europe land of under-geared school sport and falling participation but a place where professional football is brilliantly managed?”A few words from Gareth Southgate, who has been telling Independent Television what he expects of his men against Croatia.To be able to keep doing what we have been doing: play with real defensive discipline, good organisation, tactical awareness. Then with the ball play with the freedom and expression that we have and the same patterns and movements that we have shown.They of course have a very strong midfield. The higher the level of opponent, if you press in a disorganised fashion, then you will get picked through and we have got to be conscious of that.Raheem Sterling has been fundamental to the way that we have played: his movement, the positions he takes up, his pressing of the ball, his work-rate for the team, the winning of free kicks and corners, his speed to stretch teams.He was a constant threat to Sweden. Of course he hasn’t scored the goals he would have liked to have scored but for myself and the players he has been a crucial part of the way that we have been playing.Any team in a World Cup semi-final is going to find the energy and going to find the motivation. So we won’t win the game just because Croatia had half an hour more football than us three days ago. We’ve got to win because we play better.“Nothing lasts forever, not even droughts.” Expert opinion from Italy, France, Germany, Brazil, Spain and Argentina is ided over England’s chances of winning the World Cup. Here’s how they see it around the globe.Eleven o’clock, and all’s well! For the latest David Squires cartoon has landed! Trigger warning: contains some very bad news for those of us who believe that football is indeed coming home.England fans are streaming into Moscow for the big game, as you’d expect. Money no object.The greatest goalkeeper in Everton’s history runs the rule over the club’s latest netminder. Neville Southall reckons Jordan Pickford is the real deal. He explains why, but also gets one or two things off his chest before doing so. A class act, is Big Nev.Who gives you more belief that they know what they’re doing? Gareth Southgate or Theresa May? Who would you rather meet? A bright young goalkeeper like Pickford, who is turning out to be very special in this World Cup, or Trump? We’ve got so much shit going on in the world and yet our government are reportedly spending £30m on bringing a complete idiot in Trump over here. The Trump balloon they are flying over London has probably got more intelligence than him. So I am very happy to concentrate on Southgate and Pickford.That rubber chicken, in close-up.Dele Alli meanwhile has designs on irritating Luka Modric. A nutmeg, or some latex poultry launched with extreme prejudice at his noggin? Daniel Taylor has the answer.While England have everyone fit and raring to go, Croatia have injury concerns. Their goalkeeper Danijel Subasic limped his way through extra time against Russia, while right-back Sime Vrsaljko was hooked. Additionally, the Croats have had to work harder than England to get to the semis: one more period of extra-time, plus another set of stressful penalties. Here’s David Hytner on how England hope to drive home any advantage that may give them.Here, the Champions League starts again today. You’d think that can’t be right. But it is. Celtic are in Armenia for the first leg of their qualifying preliminary round tie against Alashkert. Normality is going to be hard to deal with when this World Cup is over, isn’t it.Oh yes, England. And some most welcome news this morning, ahead of the big semi-final against Croatia: everyone’s fit and available. The squad had a run-out at the Spartak Zelenogorsk stadium this morning ahead of their flight to Moscow. Jordan Henderson had been a concern with a tight hamstring, while Jamie Vardy missed the Sweden game thanks to a groin injury. But both trained. The squad also spent some time flinging around a rubber chicken. Hey, if Gareth thinks its a good idea, it’s a good idea.Kylian Mbappé has been the breakout star of the France team at this World Cup. But Adam White argues that defenders Benjamin Pavard and Lucas Hernández have been the true heroes. Here’s his reasoning.I’m aware a disproportionate chunk of this blog has been about jangly Scottish indie bands and children’s cartoon-book characters, as opposed to the football. So here’s an observation from Gokul Kannan about the 2007 ICC World Twenty20 cricket. “This England team reminds me of the Indian Cricket team led by MS Dhoni which went on to win the inaugural t20 World Cup. We Indians had zero hopes on the team which was so unexpected of an Indian team in a cricket world cup. But that lack of expectation proved to be crucial. They rediscovered their identity and quietly went about their business beating some very good teams on their way to glory.”Tonight’s big match may be of particular interest to supporters of Manchester United. The Old Trafford club will have a couple of their midfield giants facing each other down. Belgium’s Marouane Fellaini and Paul Pogba of France have both impressed in Russia this past month ... but only one can make it to the final. Marcel Desailly, a World Cup winner in 1998 and a man who knows a thing or two about their position, delivers his verdict.“Classy nod to Roddy Frame, one of my all-time favourites.” It’s the happy happy sound of Peter Oh, listeners. “Good Morning Britain is a rousing Aztec Camera tune, but given the fervent It’s Coming Home groundswell, I expected a link to All I Need Is Everything.” New Pop versus Britpop? It’s a rout. Frame 10, Broudie 0.A big worry for Belgium tonight is how to go about replacing the suspended Thomas Meunier. Roberto Martinez’s reshuffle will probably see Yannick Carrasco facing Kylian Mbappe. Oh dear. Some better news: Kevin De Bryune is expected to be deployed in an attacking role. David Hytner, our man in St Petersburg, has all the details.Today’s Rumour Mill has landed. We won’t lie, it’s not a bumper crop. But to be fair, what hot gossip we have for you is quite special. Trigger warning: there’s some very bad news for Tottenham fans, as predicted by the World Cup Fiver the best part of a month ago.“Surely no coverage of France-Belgium can ignore the eternal question ...” Rajit Ojha there, taking today’s semi-final discussion up a notch.Sam Allardyce: a penny for his thoughts* right now. Here’s a typically entertaining John Crace piece on how the nation fell head over heels for Big Sam’s accidental successor, Gareth Southgate.* ... and Roy Hodgson’s, come to that.So the business end of the tournament starts today with France-Belgium. A lot rides on the rest of the week, not least how history will come to view this tournament. USA 94 was pretty great, in the main, but the memory was seriously soured by a couple of extremely dull semi-finals and a stinker of a deciding game between Brazil and Italy that had promised so much - a rerun of 1970, basically - but delivered bugger all. Conversely, Italia 90 was almost satirically bad, but two epic semi-final matches did much to salvage that particular tournament’s reputation. Here’s hoping for a denouement to Russia 2018 in keeping with all that’s gone before. Given there’s not a completely dependable defence left, we could be in luck. Fingers crossed!Good morning Britain, as Roddy Frame once sang in equally turbulent times for a Conservative government. England played a fairly big football match in 1990, too, come to think.Alas, that’s all the time for me, Richard Parkin, on the joystick at  World Cup HQ. Thanks for your emails, tweets, comments etc. I don’t know about you, but I’ve genuinely buzzing for these two semi-finals. Let’s hope the football continues in the manner it has thus far.Leaping into the lion’s gaping maw is Scott Murray, so you’re in good hands as the UK awakes. See you next time!I’m intrigued by this from the btl commenter “Caesar of Rome”:Like everyone else, I will root for Belgium to win but the trio of Mbappé-Griezmann-Giroud will be far more difficult for Belgian defenders to deal with than Inui-Kawaguchi-Kagawa or Neymar-Coutinho-Jesús. Both Japan and Brazil had forward lines that were certainly fine in quality but a bit one-dimensional - stop the mazy dribbles of Neymar and you’re in or break down Kagawa’s link-up play and you’re fine. But with Giroud you have physicality and airborne strength, with Griezmann you have intuitive playmaking, longe range efforts from nowhere and top-class finishing and with Mbappé you have pace, dribbling and a never-wavering verve. The obvious rejoiner being that in Hazard-Lukaku-De Bruyne the Belgians have a “front trident” that mixes raw power, guile and mercurial talent, so pose a similar dilemma to the French backline.It’s a fair point though. For reasons perhaps not yet truly unpacked, there’s no doubt that Jesús had a rotten tournament, in part probably due to Neymar’s inability to share his toys. But does Martínez have a better array of defensive options, or at least defensive tactics, at his disposal to adjust, adapt and neutralise so varied a frontline? And speaking of penalties - randomly I’ve stumbled across this from the deeper, darker vaults of the internet - a  yarn from so long ago we ask for correspondence via post. Bless.One of my dreams to witness at a World Cup is that in a high stakes penalty shootout somebody attempts a panenka only for the ‘keeper not to move at all and just catch it comfortably mid-height.Almost certainly this has already happened, yes? Surely.The following isn’t from a World Cup, but for fans of the A-League, two of their stars (or former stars, now) locked horns this week in a pre-season cup in China, and for the manner in which he departed Sydney FC, I, for one, am okay with this happening to the Polish winger Adrian Mierzejewski.Suffer in ya jocks, Adrian.But for African fans following this blog, this yarn from Ed Aarons casts the “all-European” final four in a slightly different light. And indeed one of the nicer aspects to the story that is England rediscovering its affection for its national team at this World Cup, is the embrace of a new, more cosmopolitan face to “modern England”. Until Sterling misses a penalty, I guess.Going back to that Adam White piece (see earlier - or, here) - the fact that three of France’s back four were not first choice per se during qualifying is quite an interesting aspect to today’s clash as well.Neither of Benjamin Pavard or Lucas Hernández are slouches you don’t get to clubs like Stuttgart or Atlético Madrid if you’re a weak link. But - they haven’t really faced a front three like Hazard, Lukaku or De Bruyne yet at this tournament, either. Yes, Argentina should have been formidable (or at least an Argentina that wasn’t absolutely creaking at the back might have been) but don’t forget even a stuttering Albiceleste put three past France.Will either of the fullbacks, or even Samuel Umtiti whose inexplicable brain explosion handball threw Australia a brief lifeline in the group stages, be the target of a Roberto Martínez tactical plot? Another who knows a little about France’s 1998 victory is Marcel Desailly (aka “the original Harry Maguire forehead”) and what a treat it is having him on board as a  columnist for this World Cup.Not surprisingly, he identifies the pace of Mbappé as a key factor in today’s match:I really like the point he makes about the confidence, or better yet - insouciance - of youth, and how important that can be in the big games.Put simply, sometimes players can be too young to have accumulated the baggage of fear, of loss. And that’s a powerful and dangerous thing. Anyone who remembers Michael Owen striding up to take a penalty at France 1998, vs say, David Batty, can attest to this.I do hope in Mbappé’s case that holds. With Messi, Ronaldo and Neymar all gone it would be nice to see somebody really illuminate the late stages of this tournament. Kieran Trippier aside, that is. A subplot that fascinates me ahead of today’s match is the “Thierry Henry dilemma” - whereby one of the all-time great French players accidentally ends up amid the coaching staff of a team looking to prevent the 1998 World Cup winner’s own country of making another final.Kristof Terreur unpacks this for us a little more:Needless to say, compatriot Olivier Giroud finds it a touch bemusing as well:A few tips and musings coming through, from you, the good people:It is fascinating. Predicting this game. Funny that you mention ‘tactics are only as good as the players’ execution of them’. Martinez has the players who can execute any. Fellaini to Januzaj. It is entirely upon him to get the tactics right. Playing 3 at the back with Carasco as the winger would be inviting Mbappe to run you over. Playing De Bruyne deep would be pleading Kante to become the hero.Extremely tight match-up today. If pushed, I’d have France to edge it as I think they have that little bit extra. Griezmann and Hazard are both incredible playmakers with dazzling skills, but the Frenchman is the better goalscorer, for example. Lukaku is far, far better than Giroud in every respect apart from possible headed set-pieces, but then again Belgium have nobody comparable to Mbappé.Mbappe and Griezmann will provide a way bigger test than Neymar to the Belgian defence. This is because they have a better midfield backing them with Pogba and Matuidi very capable of being playmakers.I would love a Belgium win (as they are more entertaining ) but World Cups have traditionally seen boring, functional teams win.Key match ups will definitely be Kante v Hazard, Griezmann v Fellaini, De Bruyne v Matuidi, Martinez v Wigan fans. Surely Wigan fans still love ol’ RM, don’t they? At least more than Manchester City fans I imagine.I do like this idea of “heart vs head” that appears to be playing out for a lot of the neutrals - that due to a slightly more attractive brand of football Belgium are a slight sentimental favourite but scarred by “business-end games of World Cups past” (USA 94, anyone?) the smart money is on France. Or is this all just very hopeful England fans presuming that Hazard and friends represent the “easier” final opponent?And speaking of “the young people” and “the internet”, this was brought to my attention.It sounds odd to say it, but it’s almost as if the quality of football has saved the Russian government this World Cup. With so many scintillating matches on the pitch there have been perhaps fewer than expected column inches dedicated to off-field concerns.What a clever protest, though. And as an aside, a collection of the above photos would, I imagine, make a wonderful coffee table book.Meanwhile, this is not bad.I’m awful with anagrams, so yes, I did just spent the last ten minutes with a pencil trying to test that out.I am enjoying Harry Maguire’s “casual lean” becoming a bit of an internet meme, but as Finndian points out, phwaor, he can’t half head a ball. And if you’re one of those who loves their memes,  made some poor sucker collect them all. Like a Pokemon.In the interim, if you’re just waking up across continental Europe, there have been a few interesting world football transfer developments with both Manchester City and Barcelona making some early splashes:He’s a busy lad, that Pep Guardiola, who our antipodean followers of this blog will note has been popping up at sister-clubfranchise Melbourne City’s training facilities this week to the delight of fans and players alike.And speaking of football down under, the mission to bring former Atlético and Liverpool legend Fernando Torres to Australia has fallen through. Who would have thought the US might have proved a slightly bigger drawcard.The Spanish Football Federation has also moved swiftly to put Lopetegui-gate behind it, with the announcement of its new manager:And where do we imagine the key match ups will be?The blistering pace of Kylian Mbappé straight away poses questions of Belgium’s defence - how will Jan Vertonghen, Toby Alderweireld and Vincent Kompany fare against the precocious teen? There are some creaking legs there, not to mention Kompany’s well-documented history of fitness issues, especially given the tight tournament timeframes.As David Hytner mentioned (see earlier), with Thomas Meunier suspended, Martínez may be forced into an elaborate reshuffle that could see Nacer Chadli at right wing-back. Could the French target him, in the manner that the Belgians identified Brazil’s third-choice right back Fagner as the loose link?Those are just a few options to mull over your thoughts on others?Prediction is necessarily a mug’s game, but you know, the more I think about this game, the less certain I am of how it’s going to unfold.What do you think? Email me your tips, but more importantly, the reasoning behind these - and I’ll cast my red pen over them (with comments like “needs citation”).Much has been made of the impressive tactical job Roberto Martínez did on Brazil (although as he will remind you, tactics are only as good as the players’ execution of them just ask Andres Villas Boas)Does the wily former Swansea man have more in the locker in that department that his counterpart Didier Deschamps, perhaps?David Hytner has some lovely insights into the “battle within the battle” that delights football anoraks and grown-men-who-still-play-Football (née Championship)-Manager the world over:Keith Forbes is in very early doors:My 14 year old son Julian has coined the phrase, “Battle of the Frites” for Belgium v France. I think it’s quite clever. Ah, yes, Keith, but we all think our children are exceptional.Ha. I don’t mind that, to be fair. Chapeau, Julian. Now, not to start a Nuremberg v Rothenburg “who has the best mustard” war, but what do we think Belgium with an edge in the “Battle of the Frites” on the mayo front?Football-wise however, is it right to presume France are favourites, albeit marginally, for this one? 200 million+ Brazilians might disagree still waking in fright to Chucky-style apparitions of Kevin de Bruyne haunting their sleep. And that’s before you even start with Eden Hazard or Romelo Lukaku who both appear to be in career-best form.As we know though, a team is much more than iniduals, and I think that’s why this piece from Adam White grabbed me - looking at France’s two “second choice” fullbacks, and how they’ve stood tall at this World Cup:These good friends from the Schengen zone. Comrades in many historical japes together they will be glowering at each other across all 620km of their shared border today.For either of these sets of supporters, as Guus Hiddink once said “these are the games, what’s it all about”. And for the neutral, what a mouthwatering prospect - two sides that attack with verve and gusto (unless they have a gentleman’s agreement with Denmark, that is). There is absolutely no argument to build that Russia 2018 as a footballing festival has shortchanged anybody, but France’s remarkable round of 16 showing against Argentina and Belgium’s quarter-final defeat of Brazil surely rank as two of the more exciting games of international football we’ve seen in recent years.As always, it’s hard to rank things as subjective as games of football. That said, Nick Ames cast his eye over the four quarter finals a few days back, and here’s what he reckons in terms of where our final “fab four” are at.And so, at that stage of the World Cup where every day without a match feels inexorably pointless - we awake with a spring in our step, and hope in our heart, because football, dear reader, is back once more.Just three epic games to play (and one “well we may as well while we’re here” encounter) - until Russia 2018 announces its ultimate winner Vladimir Putin, aside. Will it be France Belgium England or Croatia?18 of the 20 World Cups of all-time have gone to nations that aren’t these four - have we ever seen such an open contest? Two of these have never won one let alone even made a World Cup final - will either of Belgium or Croatia make history?All we can say is that for two of these four sides that answer will come sooner rather than later, as today (*producer jump zoom*): one of these nations is going home.So get your kippers and slippers prepped, do your morning (or evening) calisthenics now, and for heaven sakes ring Mum, otherwise you just know she’ll ring you during the match.As always, do send your best insights, talking points and questions to join the conversation today: via email (richard.parkin.casual@the), twitter (@rrjparkin), or simply comment below the line.

He also doesn’t need to throw on a beanie just to get the mail. In fact, sometimes when he goes out he doesn’t bring a hat at all.That’s because three months ago Russell underwent scalp micropigmentation, a cosmetic hair loss solution that started in England and is on the rise in the United States. Scalp micropigmentation is a non-invasive treatment for people who are balding, thinning or have receding hair. Using a specialized pigment and a digital permanent makeup machine equipped with a microneedle, scalp micropigmentation practitioners penetrate the skin and create tiny follicles in the scalp, essentially producing little dots to mimic the look of stubble. It’s a condition that Iulo knows all too well he, too, suffered hair loss at an early age before eventually finding solace in scalp micropigmentation. Iulo empathizes with his clients because he knows how one’s self-confidence tends to disappear with one’s hair. In the four years since opening his clinic, Iulo has had many conversations with men about their deepest insecurities.Iulo even recalls one man who, despite being religious, wouldn’t go to church. “He didn’t want people staring at his bald head,” Iulo says. “Hair can affect someone’s life in little ways, but it can really add up.”Hiding his hair loss was always a painstaking and time-consuming endeavour for Eric D’Appolonia, a 31-year-old New Jerseyan who received scalp micropigmentation in 2015. No matter where he was going, D’Appolonia took at least an hour to get ready, spending 45 of those minutes trying to make it look like he had more hair than he actually did. He used Caboki – a shake-on concealer made of plant-based fibers that cling to and fill in a person’s hair, plus hair sprays, glues and a hair dryer to put each hair in the perfect spot, making a mess of the bathroom in the process. Before leaving, he would ask his now wife: “Is the Caboki showing?” D’Appolonia avoided any activity where he might sweat too much, for fear the black ink from the Caboki would start dripping down his face. He says there were not only social but professional challenges as well: D’Appolonia is a physical education teacher. “It was constant that I’d have to run to the bathroom to make sure black stuff wasn’t all on my forehead.” D’Appolonia was about 18 when he started losing his hair. His once thick hair was transforming into what his friend coined a “mansion-head”: two entrances in the front, where the hairline was receding into a peninsula shape, and a pool at the back, where the hair was vanishing from his crown. “I know it sounds vain, but I didn’t feel as attractive, and I was losing a lot of confidence based on that,” D’Appolonia says. He didn’t talk about his struggle much with his friends or his family because he was a master at hiding it, he says, no one really knew what he was dealing with. Once while on a vacation at Hershey Park with his now in-laws, D’Appolonia and his wife left the park early so he could get ready for dinner without her family seeing his routine. D’Appolonia and Derek Russell both acknowledge that some might consider their actions vain or shallow, but both men say that’s not the point. Getting the procedure isn’t about what people think, they say – it’s about what makes them feel good.“The majority of the population is taking action to feel good about themselves, even if that means buying an outfit they think will look better,” D’Appolonia says. Still, the procedure isn’t for everyone. “I didn’t try to fight it in the beginning,” says 28-year-old Vinny Gallo, who starting completely shaving his head after he began to go bald almost a decade ago.When a friend underwent scalp micropigmentation last fall, Gallo tossed around the idea of getting the procedure done. As of now, he has decided not to being bald doesn’t bother him that much. In fact, he doesn’t think his shorn head looks that bad on him. It hasn’t limited his dating life in any way, he notes. Ultimately, though, Gallo wonders whether, for some people, it’s about more than the scalp micropigmentation.

The distraction of bike hooliganism meant I didn’t have to admit to having no idea how capers cling to sheer embankments, or that, until the age of 32, I thought capers were a variety of seaweed.Capparis spinosa – Flinders rose, or the caper bush – is a rupicolous species, which means it can grow and thrive on rocks and crevices, withstand wind and the harshest environments. Capers grow in great tangles on sand dunes in Pakistan, the coastal deserts of Libya and Tunisia, on the volcanic soil of the Sicilian islands Pantelleria and Salina, they clamber the ramparts of medieval castles in Spain like free climbers ... and grow spontaneously on the Aurelian Walls in Rome. It was the trailing bunches clinging to a section of ancient city wall near my flat in Testaccio that taught me that the nubs of flavour on my pizza and the essential jolt of unabashed flavour in sauces, came from land, not sea.A many-branched, shrubby plant with round, shiny leaves, the caper bush blooms from April to September, its buds opening to a showgirl flower with pink petals and long, violet-tipped stamens. It is the unopened bud, though, that is potentially edible. Bright green and ranging from the size of a peppercorn to a large pea, the buds need to be hand-picked, graded according to size – the smallest being the most desirable – then cured in brine before being preserved in either a fresh brine, wine vinegar or packed in coarse salt crystals. The mature fruit of the caper bush can be preserved in the same way and is called a caperberry.The currant-sized capers from Pantelleria and Salina are among the most delicious I have ever tasted. Brined, then preserved in salt (which needs brushing away and then the capers soaking in water for a few minutes), they are tiny bursts of warm flavour, sour, saline and almost mustardy, but also floral, which makes sense when you consider the flower inside. They are also expensive – too expensive for an ingredient and seasoning to use all the time. I buy larger Italian, Greek or Middle-Eastern salted capers for everyday use in pasta sauces, green and egg sauces, or with fish or meat and little capers under vinegar for more buttery sauces.You could use both salt- or vinegar-packed capers for today’s dish, both a seasoning and an ingredient for this southern Italian-style fast food, their mustardy flavour complementing the beef like a dab of mustard, maybe.Beef with tomatoes and oregano (manzo alla pizzaiola)The term alla pizzaiola means “pizza-makers style”, which refers to the both the speed and the richly seasoned red sauce.4 slices lean beef (about 100g each and about 3mm thick)2 garlic cloves6 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil400g cherry tomatoes, chopped1 pinch red chilli1 pinch dried oregano or marjoram1 heaped tbsp capers, rinsedSalt and black pepperIf you wish, thin and tenderise the beef with a meat basher and make little cuts on the edges to stop them curling. Peel and crush the garlic with the back of a knife so it breaks but remains whole. In a large frying pan, cook the garlic in the olive oil over a medium heat until lightly golden and fragrant, then remove.Now fry the meat, first on one side, then the other – in two batches if they don’t fit in the pan in a single layer. Set aside on a warm plate.Add the chopped cherry tomatoes to the meaty juices in the pan and fry for a few minutes, pressing them with the back of a wooden spoon. Add the capers, red chili, oregano or marjoram, a pinch of salt and few grinds of pepper and cook for 10 minutes or so, until rich and saucy.Return the slices of meat back to the pan, spooning the sauce over the top and cook for a few minutes more.

Sorrell denies the allegations.“This represents a significant step in building a new age, new era, digital agency platform for clients,” said Sorrell, who has taken the title of “senior monk”. “MediaMonks’ roots are totally in new media, and data, content and technology. Our next moves will be to build this platform further and to add meaningful data analytics and digital media buying. The company will be a unitary one with MediaMonks as its core.”The deal marks a remarkable return to adland for Sorrell, who was forced out of WPP – the firm that he founded – in April following an investigation into allegations of personal misconduct.This has been followed by allegations of bullying and claims he visited a sex worker’s premises in London’s Mayfair. Sorrell has strenuously denied the allegations, but said a non-disclosure agreement signed with WPP prevented him from commenting further.S4 Capital’s deal with MediaMonks, which follows an auction process including WPP handled by Clarity Corporate Finance, includes a mix of cash and shares.Somewhat unusually there is no earn-out element for the founders of MediaMonks, a typical incentive mechanism in such deals.The MediaMonks leaders said they had “bought in” to Sorrell’s reputation for building global businesses.“With this merger, I’m privileged to be shaping the future of the creative industry alongside a man with an unprecedented reputation for building successful businesses,” said the MediaMonks chief executive, Victor Knaap. “We’re not selling out, we’re buying in.”MediaMonks makes about €110m in revenues and employs 750 people – known as “monks” – in 11 offices around the world. “With this merger we’re adding the firepower to build out our consolidated offering across creative, data, media and technology to best serve and service our clients,” said Wesley ter Haar, the founder and chief operating officer at MediaMonks. “It’s a great statement that MediaMonks is the premium platform upon which Sir Martin Sorrell’s new business is founded. That to me is also a true testament to the quality of our team and talent.”Sorrell has put £40m of his own cash into the new business and attracted £11m more from institutional investors. His backers include the investment firms Schroders, Miton Group and Lombard Odier, as well as the financier Lord Rothschild.Last week, S4 Capital raised £130m in an equity placing and also secured a €50m loan from HSBC.WPP is understood not to be looking to pursue a high court injunction against Sorrell to stop his deal to buy MediaMonks. However, it is still seeking to strip him of up to £20m in award payouts based on the performance of WPP over the next five years. Sorrell is entitled to the awards as he was classified as a “good leaver” because the company treated his departure as retirement.WPP now wants to strip him of the awards because of the alleged breach of confidentiality agreements.Sorrell has rejected the allegations and his spokesman said the legal wrangle was a “weak and feeble attempt to destabilise the bid”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d87a449d4b2537bcc243dd917f8606bbf0f3d4fc/42_16_3145_1888/master/3145.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=721c27be1c1a566d27b5bf89ceef1d31","title":"russia 2018 world cup england guardian support","story":"Our senior sports writer Barney Ronay explains how you can help keep the ’s football coverage in playHere we are then.

This is the best bit of covering sport. I’ve been going to tournaments for the  since 2008, and looking back I’m still amazed at the sheer amount of hard work and the sheer volume of content produced around these occasions. From minute-by-minute commentary sent directly to you from the vast pulsing brain of some insomniac footballing obsessive powered only by nicotine, chocolate and a haystack of empty energy drink cans. To on-the-scene reports and news from a band of reporters who write and travel and file and follow stories every day, returning to their families five weeks later hunched, unrecognisable figures unable to communicate on any subject beyond wifi quality, mixed zone ticket allocations and how to get to Salvador protea at 3am with a fair-to-decent chance of not being abducted. At the end of which comes the daily web presence and the pristine design and set of the paper itself. All of this arrives with you updated to the second, cobbled together from the corners of some sock-stinking press room, polished by endlessly patient whip-smart subs and made to look lovely by some sleep-deprived awkward genius of a layout designer. It’s no secret our industry is looking to find ways of continuing to do all this. The old way of selling bits of paper doesn’t seem to work. Advertising is a capricious business.

Perhaps it lights up your enjoyment via the frankly brilliant reporting of our football hacks, led of course (damn him) by annual award hoover Danny Taylor, and backed up by the likes of Dominic Fifield, Martha Kelner, Dave Hytner, Stuart James and, with the long range heavy artillery, the mind bogglingly good Marina Hyde.

Read about our favourite 10 and subscribe to the playlistby  Ben Beaumont-Thomas and  Laura SnapesDue in part to some much-lampooned blanket promotion by Spotify, but mostly to his sheer pan-demographic popularity, the new Drake album Scorpion is one of the year’s biggest cultural events, coming at the height of his fame – and his infamy, having sired a child with a woman, he says on the album, he only met twice. As well as this fresh drama, Scorpion shuttles between the standard Drake poles of confected beef, self-aggrandisement and light-hearted croonery like all his albums, it’s too long but still contains plenty of future best-of material. In My Feelings is a highlight – some might see this and his other takes on New Orleans bounce (Child’s Play, Nice For What etc) as defanging the sharp attack of the style, but he cleverly pairs its propulsion with a much more romantic mood. It’ll have you dancing around in a pale pink tracksuit in no time.This month saw another two drops from the rapper’s upcoming album Queen, which she has been talking up as her greatest yet. The big single Bed, reuniting her with Ariana Grande, is a little underwhelming compared with their great ode to cervical bruising, Side to Side, but Rich Sex is richly satisfying. While Minaj is always remarkably on point at speed, it’s her slower flows, where she lets each word roll round her lips and slope off her tongue, that are among her best (think Beez in the Trap), and this is a classic example. Lil Wayne also turns up with a gross but gorgeously elastic guest verse.Adopting someone else’s persona in pop is tricky to pull off: unlike film and literature, you don’t see the narrative devices and simply have to trust what you hear. Sometimes it’s awful – see Lil Dicky – but sometimes, as on Ebony Bones’ first single in three years, it’s bold and daring. No Black in the Union Jack focuses on the overt racism and xenophobia legitimised by Brexit. It samples Enoch Powell’s “rivers of blood” speech and the sound of two neighbours laughing as they exchange racist epithets, while Bones adopts the racists’ mindset in her own lyrics: “Red, white and blue  Let ‘em in to smash the system now the country is screwed,” she raps coolly over a stark, looped beat that clatters and glowers. It’s not quite the British answer to Childish Gambino’s This Is America, but it’s close.Blawan has been a UK techno hero for years now – tracks like 2012’s wildly catchy Why They Hide Their Bodies Under My Garage? showcased his talent for pounding kicks and nagging melody, while his most famous moment remains his Brandy-sampling funky house cut Getting Me Down. He’s finally released his debut album Wet Will Always Dry: masterful minimal techno in the Nina Kraviz or Radio Slave mould, where unceasing 44 hauteur is brightened with mischievous licks. Tasser is a highlight: the core drum programming ticks along like a Roomba, but is menaced again and again by a magnificently amorphous cloud of static.When every X Factor contestant and their dog can do a full-tilt Whitney warble, there’s something even more impressive about the kind of singer who keeps their melisma skill hidden, playing it as their ace. To wit, LA synthpop artist Miya Folick’s latest single, where a soaring falsetto high enough to tickle God’s beard bursts unexpectedly from her brow-furrowed verses about feeling a bit drab. It takes Stock Image from subtle greys to blazing colour, while the tense euphoria of the drum machine earns its comparisons to peak Robyn.Another great discovery from the Awesome Tapes from Africa label, which has previously brought us Hailu Mergia, Ata Kak and more, Jess Sah Bi \u0026amp Peter One are a fairly unlikely proposition. A political cartoonist and a history teacher from the Ivory Coast, they made twanging country music from slide guitar, peppy strumming, and yearning vocals in three languages. They got stadium-level massive following the release of their 1985 debut, Our Garden Needs Its Flowers, and ended up moving to the US. Currently working on music separately, there are reunion plans for later this year once the album is back out.This Swedish classic rock band, now 10 years and four albums deep, are utterly, brilliantly preposterous. Powered by the same combination of riffs, synths and peacocking used by their compatriots Europe, and with a fixation on outer space, their tightly harmonised oeuvre begs to be hollered wearing a wolf’s pelt while riding a hoverboard. Speedwagon is glorious, nodding to its AOR namesake as well as Thin Lizzy, ELO, Hall and Oates, Bon Jovi and every glam metal band ever, all condensed into a hyper-melodic ball of hair and chrome. Rock song of the year?Still bashing out existential freakouts set to bourgeois garage rock, Interpol retain their uniquely anxious energy on their first new track in four years. The major label sheen that left some of their albums feeling genuinely empty rather than performatively so has gone, thankfully replaced with blown-out drums and scuzzy rhythm guitar Daniel Kessler’s pealing lead could have come from Obstacle 2 on their debut. As ever Paul Banks’s voice, delivering poetry that seems to yearn for sexual and spiritual uplift, is the last word in seedy NY cool.The Duluth trio aren’t short of menace at the best of times, but they’ve never exuded such a sickly, shuddering spirit as on the three taster tracks from their forthcoming 12th album, Double Negative. Dancing and Blood is the most song-like of these corrosive, ambient oozes: a beat that sounds like heavy steps through coal dust suggests total desolation, while tiny synth flickers conjure images of an abandoned building that still shudders with electric current. It is phenomenally chilling (and reminiscent of Burial at his most haunting) not least thanks to Mimi Parker’s unforgiving judgments echoing through the murk: “All that you gave wasn’t enough.” Highly recommended that you chase this with strawberry ice cream and a Love Island binge. One of last year’s most fascinating reissues was a collection of 1970s and 80s work by Carl Stone, an American electronic composer, touring the UK this week, who timestretches samples and live instrumentation into glitchy burbles or transcendent ambient passages. Just as his peer Laurie Spiegel accidentally invented techno around the same time as the earliest midwest electronic dance music, Stone was understanding the collaged power of sampling at the same time hip-hop was doing so in a completely different way. Now there’s a new compilation of four of his 80s and 90s pieces – all are amazing, but Mae Yao is almost unbearably beautiful. Over 23 minutes, what starts as choppy gamelan glitching gets smoothed out by a wondrous set of quavering, manipulated tones. Is it a voice, an instrument, the wind? The point is that Stone uncouples it from recognisable timbre, leaving it as pure, contextless sound – a staggering announcement of the universality of beauty."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/668bec17443a24835af0108deaf67de17cc0a60e/114_372_2809_1685/master/2809.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c90fdaa90f1dd65469a935b0301f0a63","title":"bryn terfel webchat singer falstaff verdi royal opera","story":"The Welsh opera singer is here to answer your questions.

Indeed, he’s since sung in all the world’s major opera houses and concert halls, bringing his extraordinary voice, musicality and acting talents to every role he creates, from Wagner’s king of the gods to Sondheim’s demon barber of Fleet Street.He’s duetted with Tom Jones, Rob Bryden and Van Morrison, and performed Rule Britannia at 1994’s Last Night of the Proms clad in a Welsh rugby shirt and wrapped in the red dragon. “Terfel is a born communicator ... and the finest British singer to emerge in the last decade, even if his resemblance to Meatloaf gets more disconcerting as his hair gets longer,” said our critic Andrew Clements.He’s in London this month to sing Verdi’s Falstaff in the Royal Opera House’s revival of Robert Carson’s fine production – a real-life knight singing Shakespeare’s much-loved buffoon.Terfel’s Twitter profile lists him as “bass-baritone, father, golfer, fine-wine collector and MUFC supporter”.

By  James CrabtreeOn 3 May, at around 4.45pm, a short, trim Indian man walked quickly down\u0026nbspLondon’s Old Compton Street, his head bowed as if trying not to be seen. From his seat by the window of\u0026nbspa\u0026nbspnearby noodle bar, Anuvab Pal recognised him instantly. “He is tiny, and his face had been all over every newspaper in India,” Pal recalled. “I knew it was him.”Few in Britain would have given the passing figure a\u0026nbspsecond look. And that, in a way, was the point. The man pacing through Soho on that Wednesday night was\u0026nbspNirav Modi: Indian jeweller, billionaire and international fugitive.In February, Modi had fled his home country after an\u0026nbspalleged $1.8bn fraud case in which the tycoon was accused of abusing a system that allowed his business to obtain cash advances illegally from one of India’s largest banks. Since then, his whereabouts had been a mystery. Indian newspapers speculated that he might be holed up in Hong Kong or New York. Indian courts issued warrants for his arrest, and the police tried, ineffectually, to track him down.It was only by chance that Pal spotted him. A standup comic normally based in Mumbai, he happened to be in London for a run of gigs. “My ritual was to go to the same noodle bar, have a meal, and then head to the theatre,” Pal said. “I\u0026nbspalways sat by the window. And then suddenly Modi\u0026nbspwalks past. He was unshaven, and had those Apple\u0026nbspearphones, the wireless ones. He looked like he\u0026nbspwas in\u0026nbspa\u0026nbsphurry.”It was another month before the press finally caught up with Modi, as reports of his whereabouts emerged in\u0026nbspJune, along with the suggestion that he was planning to\u0026nbspclaim political asylum in the UK. (Modi denies wrongdoing, and did not respond to requests for comment.) In the process, Modi also gained entry into one of London’s more notorious fraternities: the small club of Indian billionaires who seem to end up in the British capital following scandals back at home.The most prominent among these émigré moguls is\u0026nbspIndia’s “King of Good Times”, Vijay Mallya, the one-time aviation magnate and brewer, who transformed Kingfisher beer into a global brand. A few years ago, Mallya was one of India’s most celebrated industrialists, famous for his mullet haircut and flamboyant lifestyle. But in early 2016, Indian authorities filed charges relating to the collapse of his Kingfisher airline, which\u0026nbspwent bust in spectacular fashion in 2012, leaving behind mountainous debts and irate, unpaid staff. And so, facing allegations of financial irregularities and of refusing to repay outstanding loans, Mallya quietly boarded a plane for Britain, too.Like Modi, Mallya denies wrongdoing. Last month he\u0026nbspreleased a long statement accusing India’s government of conducting a witch-hunt against him. And to the extent that this claim has some merit, it is because Indian prime minister Narendra Modi (no relation to Nirav Modi) has of late been under great pressure to bring supposedly errant tycoons such as\u0026nbspMallya to book.Men like Mallya and Modi were members of India’s expanding billionaire class, of whom there are now 119 members, according to Forbes magazine. Last year their collective worth amounted to $440bn – more than in any other country, bar the US and China. By contrast, the average person in India earns barely $1,700 a year. Given its early stage of economic development, India’s new hyper-wealthy elite have accumulated more money, more quickly, than their plutocratic peers in almost any\u0026nbspcountry in history.Narendra Modi won an overwhelming election victory in 2014, having promised to put a stop to the spate of corruption scandals that had dogged India for\u0026nbspmuch of the previous decade. Many involved prominent industrialists – some directly accused of corruption, while others had simply mismanaged their\u0026nbspfinances and miraculously managed to escape the\u0026nbspconsequences. Voters turned to Narendra Modi, the\u0026nbspself-described son of a poor tea-seller, hoping he\u0026nbspwould deliver a new era of clean governance and rapid growth, ridding India of a growing reputation for\u0026nbspcrony capitalism.Narendra Modi pledged to end a situation in which the country’s ultra-wealthy – sometimes called “Bollygarchs” – appeared to live by one set of rules, while India’s 1.3 billion people operated by another. Yet\u0026nbspas they continue to hide out in cities like London, men like Mallya and Nirav Modi have come to be seen as representing the failure of that pledge the Indian authorities “have a\u0026nbsplong road ahead”, as one headline put it in the Hindustan Times last year, referring to a “long and arduous” future extradition process in Mallya’s case.And as Narendra Modi gears up for a tough re-election battle next year, he is fighting the perception that India is unable to bring such men to heel, and that it has been powerless to respond to the rise of this new moneyed elite and the scandals that have come with them. “This ongoing battle to get India’s\u0026nbspbig tycoons to play by the rules is one of the biggest challenges we face,” says Reuben Abraham, chief executive of the IDFC Institute, a Mumbai-based thinktank. “Getting it right is central to India’s economic\u0026nbspand political future.” India has long been a stratified society, marked by\u0026nbspisions of caste, race and religion. Prior to the country winning independence in 1947, its people were\u0026nbspsubjugated by imperial British administrators and myriad maharajas, and the feudal regional monarchies over which they presided. Even afterwards, India remained a grimly poor country, as its socialist leadership fashioned a notably inefficient state-planned economic model, closed off almost entirely from global trade. Over time, India grew more equal, if only in the\u0026nbsplimited sense that its elite remained poor by the standards of the industrialised west.But no longer: the last three decades have seen an extraordinary explosion of wealth at the top of Indian society. In the mid-1990s, just two Indians featured in the annual Forbes billionaire list, racking up around $3bn between them. But against a backdrop of the gradual economic re-opening that began in 1991, this has quickly changed. By 2016, India had 84 entries on the Forbes billionaire list. Its economy was then worth around $2.3tn, according to the World Bank. China reached that\u0026nbsplevel of GDP in 2006, but with just 10 billionaires to\u0026nbspshow for it. At the same stage of development, India had created eight times as many.In part, this wealth is to be welcomed. This year India will be the world’s fastest-growing major economy. During the last two decades, it has grown more quickly than at any point its history, a record of economic expansion that helped to lift hundreds of millions out of\u0026nbsppoverty.Put another way, India has created a model of development in which the proceeds of growth flow unusually quickly to the very top. Yet perhaps because Indian society has long been deeply stratified, this dramatic increase in inequality has not received as much\u0026nbspglobal attention as it deserves. For nearly a century\u0026nbspprior to independence, India was governed by\u0026nbspthe British Raj – a term taken from the Sanskrit rājya, meaning “rule”. For half a century after 1947, a system dominated by pernickety industrial rules emerged, often\u0026nbspknown as the Licence-Permit-Quota Raj, or Licence\u0026nbspRaj for short. Now a system has grown in their\u0026nbspplace once again: the billionaire Raj.The rise of India’s super-rich – the first and most obvious manifestation of the billionaire Raj – was propelled by domestic economic reforms. Starting slowly\u0026nbspin the 1980s, and then more dramatically against\u0026nbspthe backdrop of a wrenching financial crisis in\u0026nbsp1991, India\u0026nbspdismantled the dusty stockade of rules and\u0026nbsptariffs that made up the Licence Raj. Companies that had been cosseted under the old regime were cleared out\u0026nbspvia a mix of deregulation, foreign investment and heightened competition. In sector after sector, from airlines and banks to steel and telecoms, the ranks of India’s tycoons\u0026nbspbegan to swell.Nothing symbolises the power of this billionaire class more starkly than Antilia, the residential skyscraper built\u0026nbspin Mumbai by Mukesh Ambani, India’s richest man. Rising 173 metres above India’s financial capital, the steel-and-glass tower is rumoured to have cost more than $1bn to build, looming over a\u0026nbspcity\u0026nbspin which half the population still live in slums.Ambani owns Reliance Industries, an empire with interests stretching from petrochemicals to\u0026nbsptelecoms. (His father, Dhirubhai, from whom he inherited his company, was one of the main beneficiaries of the economic reforms of the 1980s.) At Antilia, Ambani entertains guests in a grand, chandeliered ballroom that takes up most of building’s ground floor. There are six storeys of parking for the family’s car collection, while the tower’s higher levels feature opulent apartments and hanging gardens. Further down, in sub-basement 2, the Ambanis keep a recreational floor, which includes an indoor football pitch. Antilia became an instant landmark upon its completion in 2010. The city had long been a place of stark isions, yet the Ambani’s home almost seemed to magnify this segregation. (A spokesman for\u0026nbspReliance did not respond to a request for comment.)Unsurprisingly, some feel resentful. “You walk around\u0026nbspthe streets of this city, and the rage at Antilia has\u0026nbspto be heard to be believed,” Meera Sanyal, a former international banker turned local anti-corruption campaigner, told me in 2014. Six years before that, in 2008, as the scale of India’s billionaire fortunes were becoming clear, Raghuram Rajan – an economist who would later become the head of India’s central bank – asked an even more pointed question about his country’s\u0026nbsptycoon class: “If Russia is an oligarchy, how\u0026nbsplong can we resist calling India one?”In spring 2017, I met Mallya at his London home, a\u0026nbspGrade I-listed town house a short walk from Baker Street tube station. A variety of Rolls-Royces and Bentleys were parked along the mews at the rear, alongside a fat silver Maybach with the number plate VJM 1, which idled outside Mallya’s back door. Inside, he\u0026nbspsheltered behind a grand wooden table, a gold lighter and two mobile phones lined up in front of him. At one point I asked to be excused to visit the toilet. A flunky ushered me into a golden bathroom, with a shiny gold seat to match its golden taps and loo-roll holder. The fluffy hand towels were white, but each one came embossed with\u0026nbspthe letters “VJM” in gold thread.On the surface, Mallya still seemed every bit the ebullient tycoon of old: a bulky man in a red polo shirt, with gold bracelets on each wrist and a chunky diamond ear stud. But by then he had been stuck in Britain for more than a year, and grew downbeat as the afternoon wound on and our conversation turned to his business troubles and the state of his homeland. “India has corruption running in its veins,” he said with a sigh. “And that’s not something one is going to change overnight.”With his shoulder-length hair and taste for bling, Mallya had long honed an image as the most piratical of India’s generation of entrepreneurs. A specially kitted-out Boeing 727, its bar well-stocked with his own Kingfisher beer, whisked him between parties and business meetings – a distinction that was, in any case, often hazy. “It was all a bit ridiculous,” one ex-board member at a Mallya company told me.Now marooned in London, Mallya had plenty of time to ponder his missteps. Once a member of the Rajya Sabha, the Indian upper house of parliament, his diplomatic passport has been cancelled. As a long-time UK resident, he was permitted to stay in the country, but\u0026nbspwithout travel documents he was unable to travel, curtailing his notorious jetsetting lifestyle almost entirely. Earlier this month, a UK court issued an order allowing authorities trying to recover debts to enter his\u0026nbspvarious British properties.In his pomp, Mallya seemed to represent a new India. In a country whose old commercial elite had been dominated by cautious, discreet industrialists, Mallya was different: rich, powerful and not inclined to hide it. Not all of India’s pioneers behaved in this way – its software and IT billionaires, for instance, were typically less flamboyant figures. But while Mallya continues to\u0026nbspdeny that he did anything wrong, he admits that he\u0026nbsphas become what he calls the “poster boy” for a moment of public anger against India’s rich, as many newly wealthy business figures found themselves mired\u0026nbspin allegations of wrongdoing.India’s old system created fertile ground for corruption, forcing citizens and businesses alike to pay\u0026nbspmyriad bribes for basic state services. But these humdrum problems were trivial compared with the grand scandals that emerged during the 2000s. Assets worth billions were gifted under the table to big\u0026nbsptycoons by senior politicians and bureaucrats in what\u0026nbspbecame known as the “season of scams”. Giant kickbacks helped businesses acquire land, bypass environmental rules and\u0026nbspwin infrastructure contracts. Headlines filled up with fresh outrages, from fraudulent public housing schemes to dodgy road-building projects.Many of those who backed India’s economic reforms hoped that a more free-market economy would lead to more honest government. Instead, crony capitalism infiltrated almost every area of national life. Hundreds of\u0026nbspbillions of dollars were siphoned away, according to some estimates, by a shadowy alliance of colluding politicians and business tycoons. India’s old system of\u0026nbspretail corruption went wholesale.Many politicians also became astoundingly rich, and would have made the Forbes list had their holdings not been hidden carefully in shell companies and foreign banks. Rapid economic growth increased the value of political power, and what could be extracted from it. Political parties had to raise more money, to fight elections and fund the patronage that kept them in\u0026nbspoffice. One estimate suggested that India’s 2014 election\u0026nbspcost close to $5bn, a huge increase over the cheap and cheerful polls of the pre-liberalisation era. Election experts believe most of this money is brought in\u0026nbspillegally from favoured tycoons, in exchange for unknown future favours.Politicians spend the money to fund campaigns, but\u0026nbspalso on handing out favours, jobs and cash to constituents. “It’s sort of an unholy nexus,” as Raghuram Rajan put it to me during his tenure as head of India’s central bank. “Poor public services? Politician fills the\u0026nbspgap politician gets the resources from the businessman politician gets re-elected by the electorate\u0026nbspfor whom he’s filling the gap.”This nexus between business and politics lies at the heart of the third problem of India’s billionaire Raj, namely the boom-and-bust cycle of its industrial economy. In recent decades, China went on the largest infrastructure building spree in history, but almost all of it was delivered by state-backed companies. By contrast, India’s mid-2000s boom was dominated almost exclusively by its private-sector tycoons, giving the industrialists and the conglomerates they run a position of outsized importance in India’s economic development.Bollygarchs borrowed huge sums from state-backed banks and invested with gleeful abandon, in one of the largest deployments of private capital since America built its railroad network 150 years earlier. But when India’s good times came to an end after the global financial crisis, the tycoons’ hubris was exposed, leaving their businesses over-stretched and struggling to repay their debts. In 2017, 10 years on from the crisis, India’s banks were still left holding at least $150bn of bad assets.Since taking office, Narendra Modi has tried, often ineffectually, to fix this corporate- and bank-debt crisis, alongside the related problems of cronyism and the super-rich that contributed to it. Watching developments such as these, some argue that the power of India’s tycoon class is fading. Yet India’s ultra-wealthy are still\u0026nbspthriving, while its ranks of billionaires keep swelling,\u0026nbspand will continue to do so.There is every reason to believe that on its current course, the country’s the gap between rich and poor will\u0026nbspwiden, too. Perversely, the closer India comes to its achieving its ambitions of Chinese-style double-digit levels of economic growth, the faster this will happen. On most measures, it should already be ranked alongside South Africa and Brazil as one of the world’s least-equal countries. Even more importantly, poor countries that start off with high levels of inequality often struggle to reverse that trend as they grow richer.Many experts believe India needs to act. “The main danger with extreme inequality is that if you don’t solve this through peaceful and democratic institutions then it will be solved in other ways … and that’s extremely frightening,” as French economist Thomas Piketty has said of India’s future, pointing to likely rising future tensions between the wealthy and the rest.India is now entering a new phase of development, as\u0026nbspit tries to follow Asian economies such as South Korea and Malaysia out of poverty and towards full “middle-income” status. There is no reason this cannot happen. But as we’ve seen in Latin America, the economies with the widest social ides have tended to be the\u0026nbspones that are most likely to get stuck in the “middle-income trap”, achieving moderate prosperity but failing to become rich. The more successful countries of east Asia, by contrast, grew prosperous while managing to stay egalitarian, partly by building basic social safety nets and ensuring that their wealthiest citizens paid their taxes. Of the two models, it seems clear which India should want to follow.Much the same is true of corruption. India’s old system of cronyism, with its political favours and risk-free bank loans, has came under intense scrutiny, but\u0026nbspthe battle against corruption is at best half-won. Kickbacks still dominate swathes of public life, from land purchase to municipal contracts. State and city governments are just as venal as ever. Surveys report that India remains Asia’s most bribe-ridden nation. “For\u0026nbspany society to lift itself out of absolute poverty, it needs to build three critical state institutions: taxation, law and security,” according to the economist Paul Collier. All three in India – the revenue service, the lower levels of the judiciary and the police – still suffer endemic corruption. Perhaps most importantly, the country’s under-the-table political funding system remains largely untouched.Progress in fixing India’s problems of corporate and bank debt has also been frustratingly slow. Modi has introduced some important measures, including a new bankruptcy law and a series of bank recapitalisations. But more radical options have been ignored, notably the\u0026nbspprivatisation of struggling public-sector lenders.India’s own Gilded Age is different in many ways, but it shares at least one characteristic – namely, that such a\u0026nbspperiod of early industrialisation is also a time of rapid political and economic change, in which it should be possible to invoke what the philosopher Richard Rorty once called the “romance of a national future”, the sense of hope that infuses powers on the rise.India is set to grow in economic might throughout this century, as America did during the 19th. By some accounts, it has already overtaken China as the world’s most populous nation in others, the baton will pass during the next decade or two. Whatever the case, the fate of a large slice of humanity depends on India getting its economic model right. Meanwhile, as democracy falters in the west, so its future in India has never been more critical. To make this transition, India’s billionaire Raj must become a passing phase, not a permanent condition. India’s ambition to lead the second half of the\u0026nbsp“Asian century” – and the world’s hopes for a fairer and more democratic future – depend on getting this transition right.

Two high-profile critics of her Brexit approach have quit the government and there appears to be no immediate prospect of a challenge to her leadership. Even if there were, May remains the favourite to win a confidence vote. As a result, she now has the opportunity to consolidate her grip on the cabinet and develop her Brexit approach further, assuming the European Union responds positively to her Chequers plan.Nevertheless, the next 48 hours remain critical. May needs to ensure there are no more damaging resignations or she will be in serious trouble. Donald Trump’s arrival in the UK towards the end of the week is also critical – it will be a further coup if she can demonstrate that she can achieve something from her meeting with the US president on trade or on security. But Trump is so unpredictable that that, too, is far from certain. Few had thought May could survive a full term as prime minister after last year’s disastrous general election result in which the Conservatives lost their overall majority, but she has a rare opportunity to enhance her reputation, to show that she can be a decisive leader.The ambitious environment secretary remains in government and appears eager to prove his loyalty to Theresa May, at least judging by his appearance on the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show where he said “in all the important areas” the UK would be a sovereign country under May’s Brexit plan.Gove’s reputation within the Tory party was in tatters after he broke with Boris Johnson in 2016 and ran for the leadership himself: he now has the opportunity to show he can be loyal and perhaps earn himself a promotion to higher office. By staying in position, he can also argue that his presence in government is a demonstration of its credibility on Brexit to the party’s nervous right wing if he were to depart in the future, it would be a signal that May has finally lost the confidence of her MPs.The European Research Group, chaired by Rees-Mogg, has a choice to make. Do they try to rally 48 names to force a vote of no confidence in May at a time when it appears she would be likely to see off a challenge? Party rules say that there can be no further challenge for 12 months, making biding time an attractive option if they are convinced May will come unstuck negotiating a soft Brexit deal they find unpalatable.Significantly, Rees-Mogg was emphasising in interviews on Monday that he would not be able to vote for May’s final exit deal if it were on the lines of the Chequers agreement. If Labour were to signal it would definitely do the same, that could, in theory, leave May with a more serious problem: a looming veto over the orce talks leaving the prime minister in an extremely difficult position. It would also clearly strengthen their bargaining position.

It’s hardly a resounding endorsement of the futureCurtis “Razor” Blaydes cut loose after UFC 226’s main event on Saturday night. He had just watched WWE star Brock Lesnar strut into the octagon for the first time in two years, and engage in a shoving match with UFC heavyweight champion Daniel Cormier.“Tired of all the politics,” Blaydes tweeted. “Like is it even still about fighting? First CM Punk now Brock Lesnar. I’ll just continue to grow as a martial artist and become more dangerous and I refuse to resort to that WWE bs fake arguing just to draw in lame ass casual fans.” Lesnar’s intervention suggested to many observers that marketability is now as important as fighting ability in UFC. Responding to Blaydes and other mixed martial artists who don’t appreciate melding real fighting with pro-wrestling antics, Cormier offered a simple and telling retort: “Stay broke.”Fully embracing UFC’s “entertainment era” has meant choosing between manufacturing drama, the seemingly easier option, or playing up the real thing, which may not always exist. Indeed, Lesnar’s introduction on Saturday quickly eroded UFC 226 from a sporting triumph to a debased spectacle. Miocic didn’t have a chance to exit the cage before Lesnar grabbed a microphone and called him a “piece of shit.”That said, you can’t argue with Lesnar’s ability to generate interest. He has long been in the business of luring in audiences with caustic language, and his ability to engage folks outside the mixed martial arts world is the reason he headlined three UFC pay-per-views, each of which attracted more than one million buys.Over the last decade the UFC created fights that fans didn’t know they wanted until they were told otherwise. And by leaning on compelling personalities like Lesnar, Conor McGregor, Ronda Rousey and Georges St-Pierre the promotion generated significant pay-per-view revenue.Times change, of course. Rousey is gone to the WWE. St-Pierre is all but retired. McGregor is expected to fight again this year, though it’s hard to say how often he will appear in the octagon.This core group largely built themselves and were aided by the UFC media machine. It’s never easy to cultivate and sell big-time fighters to the public. The biggest challenge facing the UFC in recent years has revolved around finding new stars.Less than a year ago, for example, UFC president Dana White touted Cameroonian heavyweight Francis Ngannou as the future, a potential global star, the heaviest hitter in a constellation of heavy hitters. On Saturday night, less than a year removed from a title challenge defeat to Miocic, White berated Ngannou and his apparently giant ego following a terrible three-round staring contest with another listing heavyweight contender, Derek Lewis.That’s why it means nothing that Lesnar is 40-year-old and has not officially won a UFC fight since 2010, which is when he relinquished the promotion’s heavyweight title to Cain Velasquez. Or that he is caught up in an ongoing doping controversy following a failure in his last bout two years ago at UFC 200 (which also sold more than a million pay-per-views).Blaydes (10-1, 1 no contest) is currently taking the less rewarding workmanlike trek to fame and fortune. He plastered veteran Alistair Overeem with a volley of elbows last month, placing him atop a very short list of the heavyweight ision’s chief contenders.That’s why Blaydes, a 27-year-old former junior college champion wrestler, reacted so strongly when Cormier used UFC 226 to call out Lesnar, who was noticeably seated cage-side. In Blaydes’s mind it should have been him, but few know the man and the 39-year-old Cormier appears uninterested in giving some dangerous kid a shot. “I’m at a point now where it’s very difficult to fight a Curtis Blaydes,” said Cormier, who claims he will retire from MMA by the time he turns 40 in March.By any sporting measure Lesnar should not have been granted a title opportunity. Yet in White’s estimation a contest between Lesnar and Cormier is “a fight people want to see,” which is the most basic and yet the most meaningful measuring stick inside the company. At this stage, UFC fans are conditioned to root for any fight that makes the most money for the company.“I’m fighting Brock Lesnar,” Cormier said on Saturday. “I’m getting paid. I want to fight fights that make sense.” For a select group of UFC fighters big-money bouts can be a reality.

The suggestion that Ferrari were deliberately targeting their cars and that Kimi Räikkönen had intentionally hit Hamilton was farcical on many levels, not least that planning to do so would have had to anticipate Hamilton losing places.Equally with damage likely to go both ways and Ferrari very much in the constructors’ fight it would have been self-defeating. Hamilton and Mercedes have since accepted it was a racing incident. Their reaction was perhaps a reflection of the heat of the moment and the shock of being beaten in their backyard where they have been so dominant for so long. Räikkönen’s wife, Minttu, had her own take on the spat. “If you cry like a girl when you lose, do ballet,” she wrote on Instagram.Vettel’s reaction was of huge satisfaction at having beaten Mercedes at Silverstone. “Grande vittoria,” he said. “Qui a casa loro”. Understandably the German was ecstatic at having done it “here at their home”. Beating Mercedes at the meeting where they have won every time since the turbo-hybrid era began was significant. Mercedes brought their new engine to Paul Ricard and their first major aero upgrade to Austria.They would have expected to have put their noses in front but Ferrari with a new floor at Silverstone look to have matched or bettered them. Certainly the Scuderia’s car performs better in the high temperatures, with the Mercedes at its best in the relative cool of Friday morning. Just what the differential between Vettel and Hamilton might have been had they been fighting on the same tyres for the same part of track looks too close to call but with hot races expected at the next rounds in Hockenheim and Budapest, it is Ferrari who have every reason to believe they are the front runners.McLaren opened the week of their home grand prix by announcing the resignation of their sporting director Eric Boullier, not unexpected news given the torrid time the team have been enduring. They accompanied it with a restructuring of management roles as they try to reverse the decline with the team now at the lowest point in their 52-year history.The CEO, Zak Brown, highlighted a dearth of consistent leadership at the team since 2012 as central to the problem but that was compounded by a lack of singular technical vision driving the building of the car, instead using a group of three departments. The former McLaren designer John Barnard highlighted it as the fundamental problem and Brown acknowledged the result was “not a good race car”. What is clear is the need to address this issue and it can be expected that the next big announcement from McLaren will be the appointment of a single technical director. Their problem with the current market is just whom they can find to fill the crucial role.The deputy team principal, Claire Williams, said she was dreading the team’s home grand prix, so poor has their car proved this year. She said the situation was heartbreaking and it cannot have given any pleasure to Sir Frank, back in the Williams garage at Silverstone. It was never going to be an easy weekend for them but what transpired was a slow-motion car crash.Both Lance Stroll and Sergey Sirotkin went off in the first qualifying session and they were the slowest cars in the field. The new wing the team had brought to improve aero performance proved a step backward, causing a loss of grip when the DRS closed. They had to replace the wings and start from the pit lane. They finished once again at the back of the field.Williams have a single technical director in Paddy Lowe but what became clear at Silverstone is the sheer scale of his task. It will be an awfully long season for the team.Hamilton’s recovery drive was a magnificent show but his comeback from 18th also illustrated the huge differential between the big three and the rest of the field.Hamilton scythed though the midfield, up to sixth within 10 laps, all in overtaking manoeuvres.Admittedly no one put up a real fight – they were to all intents in a different race – but the way he could breeze past proved just what a huge task Ross Brawn faces in trying to level this playing field in the new regulations of 2021. There was also a further demonstration of another gulf as Renault’s engine deficit to Ferrari and Mercedes was again exposed. Max Verstappen, who did his best in a valiant fight with Räikkönen, said it was as if he was driving in a different series from the leaders.Red Bull’s team principal, Christian Horner, admitted the team “were just hugely exposed, in both defence and attack”.Optimism that they can still challenge for the title took a real blow at Silverstone in the scale of their deficit. Some long afternoons lie ahead at Spa and Monza."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f67ac1fd162a91f5ce8deb15f62b94ca8031c81b/0_101_3304_1983/master/3304.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6e67e06c30dd62d6fc1bd59b6422a5d6","title":"england v new zealand second womens odi live","story":"8th over: England 28-0 (Jones 19, Beaumont 8) A low full toss from Devine doesn’t get punished by Beaumont.

The pony-tailed Huddleston looks really rather cross. 6th over: England 18-0 (Jones 10, Beaumont 7) A bowling change: Devine for the off-target Tahuhu. She’s more on the money immediately.

The first ball faded and didn’t carry through to Katey Martin Then, an inside edge from Jones to get off the mark. Then A very wide non-wide. Then a less wide non-wide. Then two dots. And England walk out past the little All Stars and the New Zealand huddle.Both sides’ fielding fell apart a bit in the sun on Saturday - am curious to see how they fare today.

She says conditions are “almost perfect,” with a gusty wind from the media end that should make captains and batters wary. You heard it from Mel first.It’s a new strip, says Mel, “still quite thatchy. England will be trying to pepper that 300 mark.”On the evidence of Saturday, that is very possible.Hello and welcome to Derby where the women’s cricket waltzer pauses for today. I love Derbyshire, but sometimes the weather does let it down. Not this British summer though - gorgeous weather shining down over the Peak District as England’s women hope to continue their domination over New Zealand, exemplified by the 142-run win at Headingley on Saturday.This is the second match of the three-games series - New Zealand really do need to get a win on the board having been whitewashed in the T20 series too. England have won the toss and are going to bat. Heather Knight, “It looks like a pretty decent surface ... we’ll look to make the most of it first-up.”Dani Wyatt comes back in place of Lauren Winfield, but Katie George retains her place in the continued absence of Anya Shrubsole.New Zealand are unchanged.

A mediaeval castle constructed in the 13th century and heavily remodelled in the 16th, it is located in the commune of Blain in the Loire-Atlantique département of France, according to Wikipedia. Lawson Craddock watch: The EF Education First-Drapac rider from Texas has been riding with a broken shoulder and a badly cut face since crashing 100 kilometres into the first stage and says he is taking the Tour each stage at a time. ““I’m going to fight like hell,” he said yesterday. “I’ll see how I feel, the last thing I want to do is put others in danger as well as myself. I’ll give it my best shot and if I can get out there and get going, you better believe I am not just going to stop.” Earlier this morning, he told an interviewer that his every waking minute off the bike is devoted to recovery and trying to make his shoulder as comfortable, but it sounds as if the 26-year-old is in a lot of pain. Craddock is raising money to help restore a velodrome that was damaged by Hurricane Harvey in his native Texas last year. 172km to go: The gap is 6min 35sec and the race’s virtual leader is Wanty rider Guillaume van Keirsulck. He’s the highest ranked of the four breakaway riders, having begun the day with a deficit of 4min 54sec. 176km to go: And I’m already running out of things to say. This is clearly shaping up to be one of those leisurely stages where the breakaway stays clear of the peloton until the final kilometres of the stage, deluding themselves with the notion that this might just be their day, before getting swallowed up by the bunch as the sprinters prepare to duke it out for the win on today’s four-kilometre finishing straight. 180km to go: The gap from the four escapees to the peloton is now at 5min 59sec, with the bunch making no effort whatsoever to reel them in.Those leaders again: Guillaume Van Keirsbulck (Wanty), Jérôme Cousin (Direct Energie), Dimitri Claeys (Cofidis) and Anthony Perez (Cofidis).

On the UK TV coverage, co-comms guy David Millar suggests that the riders of Cofidis have clearly had the mother of all dressing downs from their directeur sportif after their awful time-trial effort yesterday. They’re racing: Christian Prudhomme drops the flag and the attacks start. There’s an immediate breakaway of four riders, including two from Cofidis. A couple of mechanicals and a crash: Christian Prudhomme emerges from his car’s sun-roof and signals to the peloton to slow down. A couple of riders have crashed and Bora Hansgrohe rider Marcus Burghardt has crashed. They’ll start racing once the trio have rejoined the bunch.

And in this case, his news sends a ripple of disappointment around the theatre: Matt Lucas, the star of Me and My Girl, has been advised by a throat specialist to rest his voice. So his understudy, Ryan Pidgen, will be playing the role of Bill Snibson, the cockney geezer who discovers – to the astonishment of all – that he is the next Duke of Hareford.The audience are not disappointed for long. Pidgen had only a few hours to practise, but it is hard to imagine he and his co-stars could have done a better job after a month of rehearsals. He lands every joke with Lucasian aplomb. “Aperitif, my lord?” inquires a snooty butler. “No, you’re alright, I’ve got me own,” Pidgen replies, rolling his eyes in bafflement. He sings and dances beautifully, too. And simply negotiating your way around a stage packed with other dancers when you’ve had almost no time to rehearse (Pidgen usually plays the role of the chef) is impressive, quite aside from taking the lead in a number like The Lambeth Walk.There is a certain energy in a show when the understudy steps up: everyone has to reassess how they play every scene (Pidgen is considerably taller than Lucas, for a start). Alex Young, who plays Bill’s sweetheart, Sally, brings sincerity and affection to their relationship. Her voice is clear and sweet, just as Sally should be. She too has excellent comic timing. “My aunt’s a duchess,” Bill explains to her. “So that makes me-” “Dutch,” she kindly replies. Even so, Caroline Quentin, as Bill’s aunt Maria, the duchess who decides she must make Bill into a viable duke, comes close to stealing the show. She is an aunt straight out of Wodehouse: all tweed, sensible shoes and absolute refusal to countenance failure. Whenever Bill or her longstanding friend Sir John try to remonstrate with her, she is frankly terrifying. “Oh, do be quiet, you futile man,” she snaps. And yet, she has a kindly streak, an adventurous spirit which all her formidable gargoyle reputation cannot quite disguise. With music by Noel Gay and book by L Arthur Rose and Douglas Furber – later revised by Stephen Fry and Mike Ockrent – Me and My Girl is not a sophisticated musical: its fish-out-of-water plot is entirely predictable and the reference to My Fair Lady (when Sir John decides to send Sally for elocution lessons) doesn’t muddy those waters at all. Although Rose and Furber’s songs are catchy, they’re sometimes rather pedestrian. This production is directed with gusto, although it loses pace at the start of the second act. Lez Brotherston’s country house set has a clever forced perspective to make it appear even grander and larger than it is. As for the costumes: quite aside from the sparkly frocks, the farmers in the local pub have tap-wellingtons, which is a tremendous choice. The only real problem is the sound: the orchestra is so loud – to combat the mighty noise of so many sets of tap shoes, presumably – that the vocals get rather lost in the mix. Everyone is forced to sing at full pelt all the time, which robs the show of some texture. But its heart is so firmly in the right place that it is impossible to be too grouchy about such things."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7b794827b3187e079b25bfda8598444b34d76858/187_0_5625_3375/master/5625.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2b54ac34cab3a15fbac75d59a61cd46b","title":"microsoft launches smaller cheaper surface go to rival the ipad","story":"New 10in Windows 10 tablet is half the cost of Surface Pro, aimed at Apple’s iPad and Google’s Chromebooks but running OfficeMicrosoft has unveiled its direct challenge to Apple’s iPad, the cheaper, smaller and lighter Surface Go 2-in-1 Windows 10 tablet.The Surface Go resembles other models of Microsoft’s successful Surface tablet range, but has a smaller 10in screen, is 8.3mm thick and only weighs 522g. But the biggest difference is the price: the Surface Go starts at £380 in the UK and $399 in the US, which is half the price of the cheapest Surface Pro tablet.Panos Panay, chief product officer for Microsoft, said: “Surface Go is small and mighty, giving you the performance you need to be productive.“When we designed this device, we had to ask ourselves what people want and need from a 10” Surface. The answers seem obvious – lightweight, productive, and accessible to more people.”Unlike the more powerful Surface Pro tablet, the Surface Go has Intel’s seventh-generation Intel Pentium Gold, which Microsoft says balances power consumption with performance, for a battery life of nine hours.The Surface Go has Microsoft’s high-resolution PixelSense screen technology, including support for the Surface Pen stylus, with its full 4,096 levels of pressure sensitivity and very low latency. The tablet also has its own version of the detachable keyboard from the Surface Pro, and the built-in kickstand that supports up to 165-degrees of angle.The new tablet is also the first to have both USB-C and Microsoft’s Surface Connector, following the introduction of USB-C to the Surface Book 2 in December. The Surface Go also has a microSD card slot, a headphone socket and Microsoft’s Windows Hello facial recognition camera for unlocking the device. It runs in Windows 10 S mode out of the box but can be switched to regular Windows 10 at any time.While questions remain around customer demand for a lower-power Windows machine from Microsoft, experts were broadly positive about the introduction of a cheaper Surface device, saying that it made Microsoft’s offerings more competitive with Apple’s iPad and Google’s Chromebooks, which have found success in the education market.Geoff Blaber, from CCS Insight, said: “Microsoft is getting more aggressive with the Surface portfolio. It’s a logical move to make the Surface concept more accessible.”“The Surface Go is an excellent proposition. ‘Built for Office 365’ is a nice way of saying - it is not your mainstream laptop (and it shouldn’t be),” said Rushabh Doshi, mobility analyst at Canalys. “Definitely gunning for the value-conscious iPad Pro aspirers. And will be interesting to see if it can make a dent in education.”The Surface Go will be able to pre-order with either 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage or 8GB and 128GB from today in the UK, US and several other countries shipping on 6 August. A version with 4G LTE broadband will be available later in the year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/856284cf29c77f652dfc7554a03585851b9c8c79/0_52_2040_1224/master/2040.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5d316911a0b6ea34f18768cfcb79d7dd","title":"bold as bauhaus how the legendary schools lost typefaces were recreated in pictures","story":"Experts have trawled the archives at the renowned German school of design, to create a series of fonts from fragments of typeface treasures by original Bauhaus students.

But can anyone top Mandy Patinkin’s French exit?The hiring and firing on a big television show can be as dramatic as the events happening on screen. Whether it is an actor suddenly quitting their post and forcing a panicked restructuring by the writers, or a showrunner leaving and taking their vision for the show with them, a cataclysmic walkout can be hard to recover from. The news that upcoming dystopian epic Snowpiercer has lost both its major creatives adds it to the roster of dramas that have had to keep competing without at least one star player.Tony award winner and Princess Bride cult hero Mandy Patinkin looked to have settled into mainstream TV after two seasons leading Criminal Minds, a disturbing FBI procedural with 14 million viewers on CBS. But when the cast reconvened for season three in the summer of 2007, Patinkin did not turn up: the series’ relentlessly dark subject matter had overwhelmed him. “I never thought they were going to kill and rape all these women every night, every day, week after week, year after year,” he later explained. “It was very destructive to my soul.” Furious producers had to arrange for seven episodes to be rewritten. It was four years before Homeland took a punt on reviving Patinkin’s TV career by casting him as Saul Berenson. Then, in 2016, another Criminal Minds star, Thomas Gibson, took more direct action when he did not like that day’s script: he kicked a writer in the shins and was duly fired.Based on the Bong Joon-Ho movie about a viciously unequal society formed by the few survivors of a frozen Earth, US cable network TNT’s Snowpiercer has itself become an icy dystopia strewn with bodies. The original showrunner, Josh Friedman, stepped off the train in February, claiming TNT had removed him “because they didn’t think I’d be compliant”. His replacement, Graeme Manson – already described as a “coward” and a “Vichy motherfucker” by Friedman for supposedly not consulting him about the work done thus far – has now lost the director Scott Derrickson. His exit statement at the end of June can be paraphrased as “Friedman’s script was brilliant, but your rewrite is a big frosty turd”. Can Snowpiercer, originally announced an embarrassing three years ago, survive? You would expect it to be a sort of WestworldHandmaid’s Tale grimfest, where people are brutally killed without warning, but losing two big behind-the-scenes characters before it has even started is a bit much.When a creative faces off against the network money men, there is usually only one winner, even if the creative’s name is Aaron Sorkin. NBC’s White House drama was more synonymous with its showrunner than just about any TV show in history. Sorkin wrote or co-wrote all but one of the first 88 episodes in his unmistakable, clatteringly smart style and, by his own admission, had delivered not a single one of those scripts on time. He had already survived a drugs bust and struggled to cope with continuing the show in a post-911 world when, with burnout biting at the end of the fourth season in 2003, disputes about the content and cast of the show pushed him over the edge. When the crunch came, Sorkin and the suits called each others’ bluff. The show limped on for three more seasons without him. Sorkin’s subsequent work has been, in comparison to The West Wing, unreliable and unfocused. Writer and producer Bryan Fuller – the king of cancelled-too-soon TV, having helmed Pushing Daisies and Hannibal – left his new job as showrunner of Star Trek: Discovery in 2016, before filming started, to focus on American Gods, a lavishly weird dramatisation of Neil Gaiman’s graphic novel. After an acclaimed but not heavily watched first season, Fuller and his collaborator, Michael Green, will not be involved in Gods’ second coming. The rumour mill agrees this was down to some combination of financial disputes – Fuller was reportedly tens of millions of dollars over budget for season one – and Gaiman’s strong views on how many changes should be made to the original text. Not accommodating Fuller’s vision means American Gods will go on without him and the Fullerphile actor Gillian Anderson, who quit not long after he did. Fuller is instead in charge of a new TV version of The Vampire Chronicles – for now, at least.This year’s final season was the Saga Noren Show but, when one of Scandi TV’s greatest cop dramas first hit BBC4 in 2012, it was very much a two-hander, with emphasis on the forced collaboration between Saga, Sofia Helin’s efficient Swede, and Martin Rohde, the Dane played by Kim Bodnia. Fans assumed the severe ending of season two – Saga realises Martin has murdered the man who killed his son – would somehow be resolved, and indeed the writers did plot a way back. But Bodnia did not like how they had done it, so he abruptly walked. Both the hastily rescripted show and the departed actor survived the bombshell. The Bridge cleverly half-replaced its male star with Thure Lindhardt as Henrik, a foil who revealed new layers of Saga’s character. Meanwhile, Bodnia can be seen on BBC1 later this year, having a blast as assassin Jodie Comer’s mentor in Killing Eve, Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s terrific spy v spy caper."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/65e202847f897eee6ef19510b15c9da0496d2914/0_73_1324_794/master/1324.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ef081f6e98cf51c263ad3c4434636c82","title":"jane austen unfinished novel sanditon to be adapted by itv","story":"Andrew Davies, whose credits include War and Peace and Pride and Prejudice, will bring Austen’s last novel to the small screenJane Austen’s unfinished novel Sanditon is being adapted into an ITV series by Pride and Prejudice screenwriter Andrew Davies. The final incomplete novel about a young woman, Charlotte Heywood, who moves to the sleepy seaside village of Sanditon and meets a man who is trying to turn it into a fashionable resort, was written only months before Austen died in 1817, and has never been adapted before. Davies said the adaptation was a “privilege and a thrill” and will feature “a spirited young heroine, a couple of entrepreneurial brothers, some dodgy financial dealings, a West Indian heiress and quite a bit of nude bathing”.When Austen died in July 1817, Northanger Abbey and Persuasion were still to be published. But after her death, Sanditon surfaced. It has been described in the  as being “notable for its unprecedentedly forthright treatment of sexuality”.Polly Hill, head of drama at ITV, said: “There is no one better to adapt her unfinished novel than Andrew … it’s a rich, romantic, family saga built upon the foundations Jane Austen laid.”Davies, who has previously worked on adaptations of Pride and Prejudice, War and Peace and the forthcoming Les Misérables, said: “Jane Austen managed to write only a fragment of her last novel before she died – but what a fragment.” Austen completed 11 chapters of Sandition before her death.Filming is expected to begin in spring 2019."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d396c17328c60a8667263c81b2782cc57c728921/38_0_2962_1777/master/2962.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=35f4d01fe58e43c45ce2af584b242661","title":"montana baby found woods debris","story":"Five-month-old boy found safe and well after being abandoned in western Montana forest wearing wet clothes in cold weatherA five-month-old baby has miraculously survived more than nine hours being buried under a pile of sticks and debris in the woods of western Montana, suffering only minor injuries despite wearing wet and soiled clothes in cold weather, authorities said Monday.The baby boy is otherwise in good condition, authorities said.Missoula county sheriff’s deputies were called about 8pm Saturday about a man threatening people in the Lolo Hot Springs area of the Lolo national forest.Deputies apprehended the man, who indicated that a baby was buried somewhere in the woods.The sheriff’s office hastily put together a search crew of federal, state and local officials that combed the forest outside the hot springs for six hours before a deputy heard a baby’s cry at about 2.30am Sunday.He found the baby facedown under the pile of sticks and debris, dressed only in a wet and soiled onesie in the 46F (8C) weather.“He suffered some minor scrapes and bruising but overall is in good health,” sheriff’s spokeswoman Brenda Bassett said in a statement Monday.The baby was taken to a hospital. Custody of the child has been referred to the state ision of child and family services. Spokesman Chuck Council declined to answer any questions about where the child will be placed or how the baby will be cared for, citing medical privacy.Francis Crowley, 32, was being held on $50,000 bail on a charge of criminal endangerment. Additional charges will follow, the sheriff’s office said in a statement Sunday.“For all of us at the sheriff’s office, this is what we call a miracle,” the statement said. “For the officers who were present for this event, it’s especially hard knowing what this small baby endured in the last 24 hours.”The nature of Crowley’s relationship to the baby was not immediately clear.

Poon, citing an unnamed source, said Liu had been allowed to leave but her brother, Liu Hui has to remain in Beijing.Her brother was convicted on fraud charges over a real estate abuse in 2013, a case activists believed was retribution against the family, and a way to pressure Liu Xia. “It’s really wonderful that Liu Xia is finally able to leave China after suffering so much all these years. However, it’s still worrying that her brother Liu Hui is still kept in China. Liu Xia might not be able to speak much for fear of her brother’s safety,” he said.BBC Chinese, citing unnamed sources, said Liu had left Beijing on a Finnair flight to Germany on Tuesday at around 11am local time. Her brother, Liu Hui, posted on WeChat that his sister had flown to Europe to “start her new life.” He wrote, “I am grateful for people’s concern and assistance these past years.”Chinese authorities have insisted Liu Xia, who has not been formally charged of any crime, has been free to move as she wishes. She has been under de-facto house arrest since 2010 after her husband, Liu Xiaobo was awarded the Nobel peace prize in absentia for his activism in China. Liu Xiaobo had been jailed in 2009 for subversion, for his involvement in Charter 08, a manifesto calling for reforms. He died last year from liver cancer while serving an 11-year prison sentence.Friends and advocates have been calling for Liu Xia’s release so she can seek medical help for severe depression. In May, Chinese writer Liao Yiwu released a recording of a phone call with Liu where she describes the mental torture of her situation. “If I can’t leave, I’ll die in my home,” she said.Her release comes a day after European and Chinese officials held a human rights dialogue in Beijing. “Hopefully she will be able to recuperate and receive much needed medical care, but China is effectively holding her brother hostage so she may not speak out about her ordeal. The Chinese government has already shown its willingness to ruthlessly deploy collective punishment against their family,” said Frances Eve, a researcher at Chinese Human Rights Defenders.

He has highlighted his support for the southern team Olympique Marseille, appeared on a TV football show, addressed the squad on confidence and teamwork in a pre-tournament visit and confessed of his childhood: “I played left-back. I was nasty though not very skilful. On the pitch, I was the sort that would not let go and would motivate the others.”If France were to win the cup, it would suit the pro-business Macron’s slogan: “France is back”.But, separate from politics, the young and ethnically erse French team has already lifted the nation’s mood. Commentators have described Les Bleus, one of the youngest squads in the tournament, as “accessible, decent, nice and humble”.While the French state still grapples to find solutions to racial discrimination and inequality in high-rise suburbs, the French football team has been hailed for showing a real banlieue spirit: showcasing the ambition of a high-achieving young generation in the suburbs backed by their supportive families.A number of the team’s top players come from the banlieue outside Paris and began their sporting lives in the excellent local youth teams, which have proved fertile ground for talent-spotters.The 19-year-old goal-scorer and national hero Kylian Mbappé is from Bondy in Seine-Saint-Denis, north of Paris, where he was a star of the local club. His father, who is of Cameroonian descent, once played in the same local team. His mother, of Algerian descent, was a professional handball player. His family are his main advisers and he is donating his international match fees to a charity that organises sports for children with disabilities.Paul Pogba also comes from the area outside Paris. N’Golo Kanté (who has inspired the slogan “Yes We Kanté!”) was born in Paris but started playing for a club on the outskirts.For the quarter-final match against Uruguay, Macron pointedly invited young teenage players from banlieue clubs and schools to watch the match with him in the Elysée Palace gardens as he sat on the grass with them in his shirtsleeves. The writer Abdourahman A Waberi said the nation’s huge support for Mbappé – “the child of Bondy” – and his teammates had already scored a victory against the anti-immigration far-right stance of Marine Le Pen and the rightwing French intellectuals that dominate parts of the media.The issue of ethnic ersity and a football team that reflects society has been historically important in France. But 20 years ago in 1998, when Zinedine Zidane’s erse team was labelled “black, blanc, beur” and hailed as an answer to all of French society’s ills, there was no overnight miracle solution to the country’s deep-seated race relation questions, discrimination and identity issues.“The politicians thought they had solved all the problems through football,” the anti-racism campaigner Mouloud Aounit said later. “In fact, the effect lasted about as long as the fireworks.”Four years after the team’s victory, the far-right Jean-Marie Le Pen — who had complained there were too many black people in the squad — made it to the final round of the 2002 presidential election. In 2005, when two teenagers, Zyed Benna and Bouna Traoré, were electrocuted when they hid in a substation north of Paris while being chased by police, the suburbs erupted in the worst rioting in France for 40 years. In 2011, French football was mired in crisis after claims that officials tried to limit the number of black and Arab players on youth training schemes to make the French team more white.The former Socialist French president François Hollande last month warned politicians against expecting sport to answer political problems. He said of 1998’s success: “We wanted to draw the conclusion that this victory would change French society. It didn’t change it. It’s up to politicians to change it.”"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Study finds Ireland\u0026rsquos reliance on gas will obstruct rollout of cheaper renewable energyRevenue discovered \u0026euro23k of cannabis in two separate seizuresTwo police officers and a member of the public have been injured in night of violenceArtwork evokes \u0026lsquostory of bravery\u0026rsquo behind 110 Skibbereen teenagers forced to fleeDenis Naughten recommends opting out of directive on GMOsCampaigners optimistic Frances Black Bill will pass when it reaches SeanadMove, after resignation of event\u0026rsquos creative director, questioned by leading arts managerMinister for Health to seek Cabinet approval to publish abortion legislationIntensifying Brexit negotiations likely to make May move further towards EU positionPM tells MPs that strategy agreed last week represents the \u0026lsquoright Brexit\u0026rsquoCoolquay village residents \u0026lsquovery disappointed\u0026rsquo at decision to facilitate new DAA runwayMuseum exhibition features Academy Award, red carpet outfits and costumesFarming couple from West Bank urge Irish politicians to back import banning Bill\u0026lsquoIt\u0026rsquos a nightmare.

On leaving their famine-ravaged home town, each girl received two dresses, two petticoats, five pairs of stockings, two pairs of shoes, a bible, a bowl and a spoon.This summer, the poignant story of 110 teenage girls sent in 1848 from the devastation of a starving Skibbereen to Australia – where they were referred to as “breeders” – will be recalled in a bronze sculpture and a large piece of Australian sandstone in the West Cork town.“This is a story of bravery, the bravery of women it is a story of heroines,” says Skibbereen-based artist Toma McCullim. The girls from the Skibbereen Union Workhouse were despatched to Australia to provide labour, marry, have children and help colonise the sprawling continent.It’s uncertain how much choice, if any, they had in their departure, the artist says. At the time, 60 people a day were dying in the Skibbereen workhouse, which was rife with disease and hunger.The 110 were essentially “farmed”, says the artist with Uillinn, the West Cork Arts Centre, who has been the driving force behind the year-long 110 Skibbereen Girls public art project.In documentation she studied as part of her research through residencies at Uillinn, West Cork Arts Centre in Skibbereen and at the site of Skibbereen Workhouse, now Skibbereen Community Hospital Campus, the girls were referred to as “breeders”.The residencies allowed McCullim to carry out research and support a variety of tours, talks, film screenings and participatory workshops on the theme of the 110 girls and their journey to Australia.The 110 girls departed for Australia under the Earl Grey Famine Orphan Scheme, named after the colonial secretary who enacted it.This scheme had two aims: to reduce overcrowding in Irish workhouses through an assisted emigration scheme and to send female immigrants to settle in Australia where at the time there were nine men for every woman.The board of s in every union in Ireland put forward the names of suitable girls aged 14-18. An estimated 4,000 girls left the country under the scheme. Skibbereen Workhouse offered the most girls outside Dublin. There are believed to be in the region of 10,000 descendants of the young Skibbereen emigrants.Although the girls did not have to be orphans to be eligible for the scheme, it was stipulated that they were not to be living with their families, be of good character, unmarried and without children so that there would be no impediment to marrying Australian settlers.“Many of them did better in Australia than they could have done in the prevailing conditions in Ireland at the time,” says McCullim.At least two descendants are expected to make the journey to Skibbereen next month for a special ceremony honouring their ancestors’ story.One hundred and 10 bronze spoons have been cast by McCullim from beeswax moulds created by staff and residents at the Skibbereen Community Hospital complex, formerly the workhouse.Throughout this month, the spoons will be embedded in the archway above what used to be the workhouse’s Women’s Entrance, near the site’s famine burial ground.This piece of public art, which will be unveiled by the Australian ambassador on July 20th, will also include an installation of a piece of Australian sandstone, donated by the Australian embassy, which is expected to be placed in front of the archway.The ceremony will take place the day after the prestigious Coming Home: Art and the Great Hunger exhibition of historical and contemporary artwork from Ireland’s Great Hunger Museum, Quinnipiac University in the US state of Connecticut, opens in Uillinn, the West Cork Arts Centre in Skibbereen.The exhibition is on display in Dublin Castle"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3559971.1531211916!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"liu xia widow of late dissident liu xiaobo freed in china","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA 2002 photo of late Chinese dissident and Nobel Peace laureate Liu Xiaobo and his wife Liu Xia in Beijing.

This time there is no doubt . . . I am so, so, so happy. Finally, finally Xia is coming today,” the dissident writer Liao Yiwu, who lives in Berlin, posted on Facebook. The foreign ministry in Beijing confirmed that she had left the country “for medical treatment”.Ms Liu suffers from deep clinical depression and she was quoted in April as saying during a phone conversation with Mr Liao that she would rather die than live in captivity.Liu Xia was placed under house arrest after Liu Xiaobo was awarded the Nobel Prize in 2010 in jail. He was jailed for co-authoring a petition known as Charter 08 seeking political reform. She had been held under close watch by state security agents and could only be reached by her closest friends and family by phone.“I’m really happy to see that Liu Xia can finally leave China. She has suffered too much over the years. I hope that she can lead a good life in Germany, ” Patrick Poon, China researcher at Amnesty International, told The .“It’s still worrying that her brother Liu Hui is in China and might be still under tight surveillance,” said Mr Poon.On the WeChat social network, her brother Liu Hui said his sister was “beginning a new life”.Liu Xiaobo’s death from liver cancer in hospital last year made him the first Nobel Peace Prize winner to die in custody since the German pacifist Carl von Ossietzky died in Nazi custody in 1938.News that Liu Xia had been freed came as Chinese premier Li Keqiang was on a visit to Germany. He met chancellor Angela Merkel on Monday.Dr Merkel had repeatedly called for her release and the German government had been in intensive talks with Beijing to allow her to travel overseas, but there had been numerous delays, usually attributed to high-profile political meetings in China.Traditionally the Chinese government has allowed high-profile dissidents to enter exile overseas, citing medical concerns. Many have settled in the German capital in recent years.July 13th marks the first anniversary of Liu Xiaobo’s death and overseas Chinese activists are planning to hold a remembrance meeting in the Gethsamene church in Berlin."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3559923.1531204163!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"may stands firm on soft brexit amid resignations and tory turmoil","story":"Theresa May has praised Boris Johnson and David Davis in a statement to the House of Commons following their resignations.  Video: Parliamentlive.tv\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritish prime minister Theresa May is working to shore up support for her Brexit strategy after the resignations of Boris Johnson and David Davis. Photograph: Getty ImagesTheresa May was working to shore up support for her Brexit strategy last night following the resignation of Boris Johnson and David Davis, the two most high-profile Brexiteers in her cabinet.The resignations came three days after the prime minister appeared to have united her cabinet behind a plan for a soft Brexit which will be published in detail later this week.Mr Johnson said he could not remain as foreign secretary because the plan agreed at Chequers would leave Britain with “the status of colony” as it would have to follow EU regulations it had no role in shaping.“Brexit should be about opportunity and hope. It should be a chance to do things differently, to be more nimble and dynamic, and to maximise the particular advantages of the UK as an open, outward-looking global economy. That dream is dying, suffocated by needless self-doubt,” he wrote to the prime minister.“What is even more disturbing is that this is our opening bid. This is already how we see the end state for the UK – before the other side has made its counteroffer. It is as though we are sending our vanguard into battle with the white flags fluttering above them.”The prime minister told Mr Johnson she was sorry “and a little surprised” to receive his resignation but said that if he could not support the government’s Brexit policy, he was right to go.During a day of drama at Westminster, Mr Davis’s resignation as Brexit secretary was followed by that of his junior minister Steve Baker. Last night, two other junior ministers, Chris Green and Conor Burns, also resigned.Ms May appointed Dominic Raab, a committed Brexiteer, to succeed Mr Davis but Downing Street made clear that the prime minister and her civil service Sherpa Olly Robbins would lead the negotiations with Brussels.As backbench Brexiteers warned that they would vote against a Brexit deal based on the Chequers plan, No 10 ruled out making any changes to the proposal, pointing out that it was approved at a formal cabinet meeting. Officials briefed opposition MPs about the proposal on Monday but Jacob Rees-Mogg warned that any attempt to win approval for a Brexit deal with Labour votes would split the Conservative party.“If the Government plans to get the Chequers deal through on the back of Labour party votes that would be the most isive thing it could do and it would be a split coming from the top, not from the members of the Conservative Party across the country,” he said.Ms May defended the Chequers plan in the House of Commons, telling MPs it was “the right Brexit” for Britain and that it would protect the interests of business while respecting the decision to leave the EU.“What we are proposing is challenging for the European Union. It requires the EU to think again, to look beyond the positions that it has taken so far, and to agree a new and fair balance of rights and obligations. That is the only way in which to meet our commitments to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland without damaging the constitutional integrity of the UK and while respecting the result of the referendum,” she said.The Government was reluctant to comment on the resignations in London, and sources said they didn’t want to do or say anything that made life any harder for the British prime minister. But privately senior figures welcomed the confrontation between Ms May and the hard Brexiteers, long anticipated in Dublin.Though neither Mr Davis or Mr Johnson were greatly regarded in Dublin, their departure was taken as a sign that Ms May was seeking to push through a softer Brexit.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

He makes inmates at his jail, Tent City, sleep in tents where temperatures in the Phoenix heat reach the high 40s. Video: Simon Carswell\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tJoe Arpaio: As sheriff of Maricopa County for more than 24 years, he built a nationwide reputation for a tough attitude to law enforcement. Photograph: Suzanne LynchJoe Arpaio remembers exactly where he was when he learned he had received a presidential pardon from US president Donald Trump.“It was my wife’s birthday, and we were getting ready to go to the Italian restaurant across the street. My lawyers came round saying they had a document for me to sign. I thought it was a joke at first, but then we saw on TV that the White House had issued a statement. I insisted we went to dinner but I couldn’t get to my meatballs with the media calling.”Arpaio, the 86-year-old who dubs himself “America’s toughest sheriff” , is one of the most infamous law enforcement officials in the United States. As sheriff of Maricopa County for more than 24 years, he built a nationwide reputation for a zero-tolerance policy on rounding up illegal immigrants and a tough attitude to law enforcement.His notorious tent-city prison just south of Phoenix forced prisoners to work outdoors in blistering heat and wear pink underwear. Some were chained together as they worked, prompting outcries from human rights groups giving him national prominence.Arpaio’s tough stance on immigration resulted in a court conviction. He was found guilty last year of criminal contempt of court over his “flagrant disregard” for a court order to stop his immigration round-ups, which were deemed to illegally target Latinos.His defiance of the court order could have landed him six months in prison, but Trump intervened.At a rally in Phoenix in August 2017 the president first floated the idea that he might pardon “Sheriff Joe”, to cheers from his supportive audience. A week later, Arapaio got the news of the pardon.Today, the framed presidential pardon signed by Trump has pride of place on Arpaio’s wall in his Fountain Hills office, just outside Phoenix.The pardon has reinvigorated the former law enforcement officer, who was voted out by Maricopa County voters in 2016 after 24 years as sheriff. Undeterred, he is now contesting, in November’s mid-term elections, the Republican nomination for the Senate seat vacated by Jeff Flake.Trump’s decision to pardon the sheriff – the first such action of his presidency – was seen in part as a move by him to express solidarity with a man who had backed him from the beginning. Arpaio, who has long been an institution in Arizona Republican politics, was one of the first to back the billionaire businessman when he emerged as a candidate for the presidency.“I supported him the day he announced,” he recalls as he sits in his office chair in front of an American flag. “His first rally happened to be here in Phoenix in late 2015. At that stage there was about 17 or 18 people running for president. I introduced him, but nobody would stand next to him.” A few days before the Iowa caucuses, Arpaio came out and officially endorsed Trump.“My gut told me he was going to win. I’ve met many presidential candidates, so I knew he had it. I’m pretty proud of the fact that I was with him from day one,” he says.The common ground between the two men was obvious – immigration. For Arpaio, who has built his career on implementing a zero tolerance approach on this issue, Trump was someone who tackled it head-on. “During the campaign, Trump was the one that brought up illegal immigration. It made the other 16 candidates a little concerned – they then had to face up to the issue of what to do about illegal immigration. Election after election everybody talks about it, they go down to the border and stand in front of the wire fence, but they’re scared of agitating voters.”Arpaio’s stance on the current immigration crisis is unbending.Does he believe any of the 11 million undocumented migrants living in the US, many of whom pay taxes, should be regularised? He pauses before replying definitively: “No. They should go back and then come back legally.” This includes “Dreamers”, the undocumented people who arrived in the US as children.“Why should we legalise someone who has violated the law, who has sneaked into our country. I look at this as a fairness issue. You have people from around the world, from Europe, Ireland who wait for years to be able to come into the United States, and yet you have someone crossing the border illegally and you take care of them. That’s unfair.”As for the crisis at the Texas border that has seen children separated from their parents, Arpaio is similarly tough.“When the adults bring them in, they ought to be charged with an extra crime. Why would they bring young people into this country illegally, risking their lives, bringing young people across the desert?” He also argues the Mexican government has a role to play. Noting that many immigrants are coming from South America through Mexico, he says the Mexican government should arrest them before they cross the border.As for November’s election, Arpaio says he is quietly confident, though he accepts he will have a tough battle. His main focus will be getting through the Republican primaries on August 28th.He faces two Republican rivals for the Senate seat – congresswoman Martha McSally and Kelli Ward, a right-wing candidate who has been backed by former Trump advisers Steve Bannon and Sebastian Gorka.A recent poll put McSally well ahead of Ward and Arpaio, in part because of a subtle repositioning in recent months. While the Tucson-based Congresswoman was reticent about her support for Trump, in recent months she has been allying herself with the president on certain issues, a sign perhaps of the increasing sway Trump is holding among Republican voters.It is a shift not lost on Arpaio, who notes – without mentioning his two rivals directly – that he has been a diehard Trump supporter from the beginning. “All of these opponents of mine, once they discovered how to spell his name – once they see the polls – then they support him. If he was way down in the polls, they wouldn’t want to be near him.”While many see Arpaio as a Roy Moore-style candidate – the controversial former chief justice in Alabama who lost a special election there earlier this year – Arpaio points out that he has frequently had to win the support of an electorate of more than four million people when he was running for sheriff, while his opponents have experience only of running in smaller district elections.He also alleges a conspiracy against him. He wrote to attorney general Jeff Sessions in recent weeks calling for an investigation into the Department of Justice’s role in agreeing to hold the contempt of court case against him weeks before the 2016 sheriff election, which he lost.In this sense he finds common ground with Trump. “I want an investigation into what they did to me. There are similarities with what happened to the president – the same actors.

Paul Merton, one of the team captains, criticised her for being “arrogant”, saying: “Suddenly she thought she was Victoria Wood.”Soubry tweeted earlier this year: “A charming Ian Hislop called \u0026amp invited me on the panel of #HIGNFY (again).

It will have an all-female line-up.“If you see an all-male panel, you don’t expect them to just be talking about beer and football, do you? I don’t want it to feel alienating for men.”But the show will be low on banter. Bunting said: “I’m not overly keen on banter. Who is?

the world\u0027s first independent air service.Beginning with a service at Westminster Abbey, the Queen was joined by family members including the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall, the Duke of Cambridge and the Duke and Duchess of Sussex.Along with Charles, she will then present a new Queen\u0027s Colour to the RAF in the forecourt of Buckingham Palace before making a brief speech.The royals then appeared on the balcony of the Queen\u0027s London residence to view a flypast of up to 100 RAF aircraft at 1pm, a parade of more than 1,000 personnel, and a feu de joie.Members of the Royal Air Force parade down The MallCharles, William and Harry all chose to wear No 1 RAF uniform to Westminster Abbey, with Kate wearing a Dacre Brooch - which was presented to her by the Air Cadets when she took on patronage in 2015.And despite still being on maternity leave, after giving birth to Prince Louis only 11 weeks ago, it is understood that Kate felt it was important to attend Tuesday\u0027s celebrations.Kate wore a coat by Alexander McQueen, and a hat by Sean Barrett, with Meghan choosing to wear a dress by Dior and a hat by royal milliner Stephen Jones.The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and the Duke and Duchess of Sussex arrive at a service at Westminster AbbeyThe Duke and Duchess of Cambridge during the Westminster Abbey serviceThe Duke and Duchess of Sussex outside Westminster AbbeyThe Prince of Wales salutes outside Westminster AbbeyAnd in keeping with the traditional blue of the RAF, the Queen wore a royal blue silk coat with a turquoise collar and dress in the same colour, both by Angela Kelly, with a matching hat by Angela Kelly and a diamond star brooch.The Queen wore a royal blue silk coat with a turquoise collar over a dress in the same colour for the serviceMore than 2,200 people packed Westminster Abbey for the service, with dignitaries including Prime Minister Theresa May, Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn attending alongside the royals.Theresa May shakes hands as she arrives at Westminster AbbeyThe Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, addressed the congregation and said the RAF has in its first 100 years been a decisive factor in serving the country, as well as being key in protecting democracy and freedom.With an RAF ensign draped over the high altar behind him in the abbey, Mr Welby also highlighted how members of his own family have served and been killed in the RAF - drawing attention to his own father who flew low level sorties in Burma.Video: Royals at Westminster AbbeyAir-Vice Marshal Gerry Mayhew, the air officer commanding No 1 group and the senior responsible officer for the flypast, said the day is the centrepiece of the RAF\u0027s 100th year.It is the high point for the capital, Her Majesty the Queen and the Royal family, he said.And it is a great opportunity to look back and really celebrate our past, but to look forward is a really important thing for us as we look to the next 100 years.He described being at the forefront of the flypast as a great honour, and said he hopes the Queen and royal family will see exactly what they can do for the monarch.Asked what message a 100-aircraft flypast may send to Britain\u0027s adversaries and the world, he said: It demonstrates we are a competent, professional and capable air force that has a credible, very credible, set of capabilities.Charles, Camilla, William, Harry and Meghan will also meet veterans, personnel, charity representatives and those from the civil service in a reception after the spectacle.Video: 100 years of the Royal Air ForceThe flypast is set to feature aircraft including Puma and Chinook helicopters, a Lancaster, Spitfires, Hurricanes, the A400M Atlas, Tornados, Typhoons and the F-35 stealth fighter jets.Drawing the spectacle to a close will be the Red Arrows, who in traditional aerobatic style will stream red, white and blue smoke down the length of The Mall.The officer commanding the Red Arrows, Wing Commander Andrew Keith, who took the helm in August, said it is an incredible year to be leading them.During the flypast, he said he will be flying in the formation in the back seat of the team leader\u0027s jet, getting a few photos.It is going to be business as usual for us - and hopefully clocking over that 100th aircraft, he said when asked if they will be doing anything different on the day.Please review our commenting policyThai cave rescue success as all 12 boys and coach saved after 18 days -

They also guarantee at least one day off a week, a minimum of four weeks’ paid annual leave a year.Criticising the regulations, Mr Raab wrote: “By limiting flexibility and adding to employers’ costs, the regulations impede job creation.”He added: “Britain should secure a total opt-out from the working time directive and scrap the UK Regulations, ensuring that this costly, anti-jobs legislation cannot cause further damage to the economy.”Brexit talks: Top issues facing UK on leaving EUA key point in the negotiations remains Britain\u0027s access to, or withdrawal from, the EU customs union. Since the referendum there has been hot debate over the meaning of Brexit: would it entail a full withdrawal from the existing agreement, known as hard Brexit, or the soft version in which we would remain part of a common customs area for most goods, as Turkey does?Though progress was made last year, there has still been no solid agreement on whether there should be a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.Despite protests from a small number of Conservative MPs, the Government and the EU are largely in agreement that a transitional period is needed after Brexit.47 Rights of EU citizens living the UKThe Prime Minister has promised EU citizens already living in the UK the right to live and work here after Brexit, but the rights of those who arrive after Brexit day remains unclear.57 Future trade agreement (with the EU)Despite this being a key issue in negotiations, the Government has yet to lay out exactly what it wants from a trade deal with the EU.The Government has already begun trying to woo foreign leaders into prospective trade agreements, with various high profile state visits to China, India and Canada for May, and the now infamous invitation to US President Donald Trump to visit London.Banks in the UK will be hit hard regardless of the Brexit outcome. The EU has refused to give British banks passporting rights to trade within the EU, dashing hopes of a special City deal.A key point in the negotiations remains Britain\u0027s access to, or withdrawal from, the EU customs union.

The EU has refused to give British banks passporting rights to trade within the EU, dashing hopes of a special City deal.Mr Raab also called for UK to abolish EU rules that, in his words, “give agency workers the right to the same basic employment and working conditions as full-time staff” once they have been working for a company for 12 weeks.He said these “increase the cost of hiring” and would prevent businesses from using agency workers.Staff\u0026nbsprights to maintain existing conditions even if new owners come\u0026nbspin should also be scrapped, he said, adding: “That is bad for business: successful companies should be free to extend their more competitive business model to new acquisitions.”In the same report, Mr Raab called for the minimum wage to be abolished for some workers under the age of 21, and said it should be made easier for companies to sack “underperforming” employees.Paul Blomfield, the shadow Brexit minister, told The Independent: “The new Brexit secretary has long harboured ambitions to slash vital workplace protections and rights, and the prime minister has now put him in a position to do so.“This latest blow for workers comes a few days after the cabinet failed to rule out a race to the bottom with the EU on crucial employment protection. It’s become abundantly clear once again that this chaotic Tory government cannot be trusted with people’s rights after Brexit.”The new Brexit secretary was appointed on Monday morning after David Davis resigned over disagreements with the government’s policy.The government has been contacted for comment.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Mr Ahmed\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspMr Afwerki then travelled across the capital in a large motorcade as people wearing T-shirts with photos of the two leaders cheered. The leaders later met one-on-one, with a smiling Mr Ahmed\u0026nbspleaning towards\u0026nbspMr Afwerki under a wall hung with their portraits.The visit comes a month after Mr Ahmed\u0026nbspsurprised people by fully accepting a peace deal that ended a two-year border war between the two countries. Ethiopia and Eritrea have not had diplomatic ties since the war began in 1998, with Mr Ahmed\u0026nbsphimself fighting in a town that remains contested today, and the countries have skirmished since then in one of Africa’s longest-running conflicts.Mr Ahmed’s chief of staff, Fitsum Arega, said on Twitter that the visit aims to “further deepen efforts to bring about lasting peace.” He shared photos of the leaders’ meeting and said Mr Ahmed\u0026nbspwas “very warmly received” by Mr Afwerki.“Our two nations share a history and bond like no other,” he said. “We can now overcome two decades of mistrust and move in a new direction.”Ethiopia’s foreign ministry called the visit “part of efforts to normalise relations with Eritrea” and said Mr Ahmed\u0026nbspwas expected to talk with Eritrea’s leadership about “how to mend fences”.One Eritrean diplomat, its ambassador to Japan Estifanos Afeworki, said on Twitter that “no leader has received such a warm welcome like today in Asmara in the history of Eritrea”.Ethiopians expressed welcome shock at the meeting, which was shown live by Ethiopia’s state TV.“Historic ... the beginning of the end. The glass ceiling has been broken,” one resident, Shewit Wudassie, wrote on Facebook. Another Facebook user, Djphat Su, wrote: “Am I dreaming or what?”The decision to fully accept the peace deal was the biggest and most surprising reform yet announced by Ethiopia’s 42-year-old prime minister, who took office in April and quickly set off a wave of reforms, freeing journalists and opposition figures from prison, opening up the state-run economy and unblocking hundreds of websites after years of anti-government protests demanding more freedoms.World news in picturesIndonesia worker and firefighters try to extinguish a fire on fishing boats at Benoa harbour in Denpasar, on Indonesia\u0027s resort island of Bali.

In the video, Ms Warren says the teenager \u0026nbsp– an intern in her office, according to the\u0026nbspWashington Post\u0026nbsp– was barred from giving his speech because of prior disagreements with the school principal.“For some reason, his school – in a country where freedom of speech is a constitution right, and the city of Frederick Douglass – turned his moment of triumph into a time of sorrow and pain,” she said, adding: “The is not a time to punish a child because you may not like what they say.”Mr Munno gave a different version of events to Spectrum News, saying Mr Lovett was asked if he wanted to give a speech weeks before the ceremony, but said no. He added that the student changed his mind about speaking just before the ceremony, and refused to supply a copy of his address.The former administrator\u0026nbspcould not be reached Monday for additional comment.Mr Lovett, who graduated at the top of his class and is headed to Clark Atlanta University on an academic scholarship, acknowledged that he’d had confrontations with Mr Munno in the past.

Here are the candidates most likely to take over, with odds from Ladbrokes.Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Latin-fluent millionaire financier and MP for North East Somerset, has emerged as the leading Brexiteer on the backbenches.He has also has garnered a surprise following among many young Tories - including Jungle Queen Georgia Toffolo, who called him a sex god.Devout Catholic Rees-Mogg has made no secret of his socially conservative views, including being anti-abortion and against gay marriage.His plummy tones, double-breasted suits and traditional manner have earned him the nickname The Honourable Member for the Nineteenth Century.Jeremy Corbyn has emerged as the favourite among most bookies as the nations likely next PM.The Labour leader has had to fight constant opposition from his own MPs including a leadership contest after just a year.But the party has swung behind him after a much stronger than expected 2017 general election when Labour picked up 30 seats and Mrs May lost her majority.Despite a study showed the fabled youthquake of support from younger voters did not happen, he is enjoying strong support in opinion polls.He will be hoping Tory infighting over Europe leads to another election, which he has boasted he would win.Environment secretary has achieved a remarkable turnaround since knifing Boris Johnson.His support among party members dropped through the floor and it seemed his chances were gone forever.But Mr Gove, who played a key role in the 2016 EU referendum, has rebranded himself as an ecowarrior and green campaigner as Environment Secretary.Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson is still a hugely popular figure among Tory grassroots and the general public.But his support among fellow MPs seems to have evaporated in the EU referendum fallout.Mr Johnson infuriated David Cameron by using his huge public profile to campaign for Leave.His own leadership bid in 2016 was scuppered by his friend Michael Gove, severely damaging his electoral brand.BoJo has repeatedly pledged his support to Mrs May but has also angered Cabinet colleagues by trying to hijack Brexit talks and demanding extra cash for the NHS.His ambitions for the top job are well known and he is a proven winner, having been elected twice as Mayor of London in a city that heavily favours Labour.Thought an unlikely candidate at the time, the Brexit campaigner reached the final two of the 2016 leadership contest.She withdrew over ill-judged remarks about Theresa Mays childlessness.She is now Leader of the House, and survived in post despite reports Mrs May was planning to cut dead wood in her January reshuffle.Mrs Leadsom had a role in the downfall of Sir Michael Fallon after she accused him of lewd sexual comments.At one time, Ms Rudd was a leading contender to replace the PM but her odds have lengthened significantly following the Windrush scandal and her resignation after misleading Parliament over immigration targets.She has returned to the backbenches after being forced to resign as Home Secretary and is likely to push for a softer Brexit along with other former Cabinet members like Nicky Morgan and Justine Greening.Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond could make a bid for Number 10 after keeping a low profile during the general election.Mr Hammond is seen by supporters as a steady hand, but critics accuse him of trying to kibosh a clean-break Brexit by steering the PM towards keeping close ties.He is seen as one of the leading campaigners for a soft Brexit which often puts him at odds with Brexiteers like Liam Fox and David Davis.Brexit Secretary David Davis had a prominent role leading Britains Brexit negotiations in Brussels but has now resigned.Last July a study found more than a fifth of Conservatives wanted him to take as PM.But the latest polls of party members shows his support has slipped behind potential rivals.Mr Davis previously stood for the party leadership in 2001 and 2005 coming fourth and second respectively.His working-class roots also distance him from the view of Tories as out-of-touch toffs.But he has also been accused of being thick and lazy and there were calls for him to be held in contempt of Parliament over non-existent impact papers.The new Brexit secretary is now in the running after taking Davis vacant spot.He played a prominent role in the Leave campaign, and previously served as a Justice minister too.Before he went into politics he was a lawyer, working on EU and World Trade Organisation Law.His appointment has been welcomed by other Leave-backing MPs.But Labour MPs have been circulating a blog-post he wrote back in 2011 where he called for an end to feminist bigotry and said that men were getting a raw deal after new equality legislation.Mrs May was humiliated when her snap election backfired last June, costing the party its Commons majority.She also endured a series of mishaps during Octobers Tory Party conference and the fallout of the Pestminster scandal.A survey of Tory members in July showed more than 70 per cent want the PM to remain in post, but that fell to just 26 per cent in February 2018.If Mrs May was to resign there would be likely be a Tory leadership campaign, with the winner crowned PM.Alternatively, Mrs May could lose a vote of confidence, leading to the government falling.In theory, the Queen could ask the Labour leader to form a minority government, but the numbers in the Commons would make it impossible for him to govern.In this scenario, there could well be a fresh General Election with both major parties trying to secure a parliamentary majority.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Signalling that the UK might stay in a Customs Union was another enormous error.Downing Street has consistently left unchallenged the scare tactics of professional Remainers — big businesses seeking ongoing EU protection, Brussels-funded think tanks and member states wanting UK cash.The Irish land border, for instance, already copes with different currencies, duties and other tax rates.Outside the Customs Union there is no need for physical hard border posts that might inflame sectarian sensitivities — as confirmed by the head of HMRC, his Irish equivalent and a study published by the European Parliament.Instead of explaining these realities, and arguing Britain’s corner, Mrs May has allowed Irish border falsehoods to warp her entire Brexit strategy.Roberto Azevedo insisted trading with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules was “perfectly manageable”.She has similarly failed to counter claims it would be disastrous to leave the EU with no free trade agreement, using World Trade Organisation rules instead.Again, this is nonsense. Britain already conducts most of its trade outside the EU, largely under WTO rules.“It is not the end of the world if UK-EU trade is on the basis of WTO rules”, WTO director general Roberto Azevedo told me. “It’s ­perfectly manageable.”That’s a vital insight because, unless no deal is seen as a viable option, the UK’s negotiating hand is seriously undermined — with Britain then forced to accept whatever trade deal the EU offers as March 2019 nears.The Government should have been making determined and very visible preparations for no deal.The irony is that, behind the scenes, there has been considerable work.Last week the National Audit Office concluded that an HMRC upgrade that was happening anyway means ­Britain’s customs service should be ready to cope with no deal from January 2019.Instead of pursuing such rational strategies, Mrs May now wants the UK, in effect, to stay in the Single Market for goods, while facing greater restrictions on trade in services.This is totally lopsided — Britain is far better at exporting services (we run a £14billion annual surplus with the EU) than goods (which show a £96billion EU deficit).And proposals to solve the Irish border by tracking goods and collecting the EU’s tariff revenues have already been rejected by Brussels.Mrs May should just leave the Single Market and the Customs Union, with no deal if necessary.By presenting absurd ideas, our Mad Hatter Prime Minister appears to hope her people will conclude Brexit is too hard and should be abandoned.If so, she doesn’t understand the country she purports to govern.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Mass deportations of illegal immigrants? Jawohl!And don’t mention the #RefugeesWelcome hashtag.What a change of heart. Merkel’s solution to the refugee crisis of 2015 was to dismantle Germany’s borders.No elected politician in modern history has ever acted with such monumental, breath-taking arrogance.Merkel’s grandiose virtue signalling unleashed mass, mostly economic migration that continues to this day.More than a million refugees poured into Germany in 2015 alone. They were almost exclusively young men because the old, the sick and children — the most vulnerable refugees and those most deserving of a helping hand — can’t walk the length of the Balkans.Anyone who had doubts about promoting limitless uncontrolled migration was silenced by Merkel’s smug catchphrase, “Wir schaffen das!” — We can do this!But Germany, and Europe, will pay the price for Angela Merkel’s apocalyptic arrogance long after she is pushing up edelweiss.Merkel’s career is on its knees because she permanently changed Germany without ever consulting the German people to see if her policy of the unmanaged migration of one million-plus young males from a totally different culture was actually WHAT THEY WANTED.Merkel never even thought about the wishes of the German people. We hear a lot about the rise of “populism” everywhere from Trump’s America to the new, vehemently anti-EU coalition government in Italy.But there is no great mystery about the rise of anti- establishment sentiment. For decades haughty politicians have viewed their own people with unbridled, undisguised, unapologetic contempt.Now, all over the Western world, they are paying the price.Theresa May should carefully study the fall of Angela Merkel. Whatever the polls might say, few would weep to see May departing Downing Street.It seems increasingly likely, from what we’re hearing out of Chequers, that this prime minister would far prefer to cuddle up to the crumbling EU empire rather than break free and strike trade deals with the US, Australia, Canada, India and China.But if we can’t trade with the world then it is not a soft Brexit. It is no bloody Brexit at all.Her job is not to soften our departure from the EU to such a degree that it becomes meaningless.Whatever her personal preferences, Theresa May’s job, and the historic role that falls to her now, is to honour the referendum of 2016, the vote we were solemnly promised was final by our former prime minister, David Cameron.It is not complicated. Don’t do a Merkel.Theresa May has to respect democracy and the will of the British people.And if she doesn’t or she can’t, if May betrays the British people, if she castrates or buggers up Brexit, if she tells 17.4million that they are ignorant racist bigots who should never have had a vote in the first place, then we are going to need a new prime minister.In Merkel’s spectacular fall from power there is a lesson for every leader in the Western world, especially Theresa May.You are not our master. You are our servant. You do not know best. And you ignore the will of your people at your peril.THIS World Cup has been a revelation. Who knew we would still be working up a sweat long after Germany, Argentina, Brazil and Spain had flown home?Who knew that England could win a penalty shoot-out in a World Cup? Then cruise through a quarter-final?And who knew England could only ever really succeed again – and true success means having a team that we love and take pride in – if we returned to having English managers? All jaw-dropping stuff.Now Alicia Aylies – former Miss France and the girlfriend of France’s fleet-footed Kylian Mbappe – proudly poses in a zippy bralet.Seriously, who had ever heard of the zippy bralet until Russia 2018? The shocks just keep on coming.FOR two weeks every year, the British go crazy about tennis.The Australian Open, Roland-Garros in France and the US Open hardly merit a second glance from the British public but Wimbledon is an essential part of our calendar.Yet this year our attention has been distracted by another sporting event in a distant land. The men’s singles final will overlap with the World Cup Final.But quite frankly, who cares?This year we are lukewarm on Wimbledon.So you had to feel for British wildcard Katie Boulter, knocked out in the second round.There is still plenty of time for Henman Hill or Murray Mound to become Boulter’s Bulge or Katie’s Cusp.LONDON Mayor Sadiq Khan is allowing a Donald Trump blimp to float above London during the President’s visit to the UK.No news yet on if Khan has plans to do anything about the gun, knife and acid epidemic on the streets of London.With well over 1,000 stabbings this year, more than fifty of them fatal, crime in London is out of control.But at least we have that Trump balloon, Sadiq.DIEGO MARADONA was pictured grinning happily in an XXL Colombia shirt before their match with England but was apoplectic in defeat.“You have to denounce this,” fumed Maradona.“As the captain of legends, I have to tell Infantino (Fifa President) this cannot be left like this.“This is a fatal mistake for the whole country.”I’m sure it all sounds much better in translation.But you get the gist – “Our headbutting boys were robbed”.Fifa hands Maradona a reported £7,000 to turn up at every match and the fat man issued a grovelling apology for criticising the ref when he reflected that seven grand might possibly slip through his cheating hands.But you can hardly blame Diego Maradona for sticking up for those grappling, nasty, spiteful, penalty-spot-scuffing Colombians.After all, Diego has done his best to single-handedly prop up one of Colombia’s major exports. And that’s nothing to sniff at.YOUNG mum Claire Morrison, 28, was mortified when her six-year-old daughter Eve took her vibrator to school for show-and-tell because Eve thought it was a particularly interesting looking pen.Some parents might prefer to keep quiet about this mishap, but Claire has gone on Facebook to tell the “hilarious” story.“She just said it was her funny pink pen,” chuckles Claire, a hairdresser from Dundee. “Then she said, ‘It must talk because it needs batteries’. So her stepdad and I laughed that off and we have safely stored it away.”It has now been shared 6,000 times.The story. Not the vibrator. Obviously. That wouldn’t be very hygienic.WE can all understand why David and Victoria Beckham would want to put on a public display of loving solidarity on their wedding anniversary.But I can’t help wondering, does Victoria really need to tell David “I love you so much” via her Instagram account and its 21.3million followers? It seems so extravagantly public.Couldn’t she just give him a card?AFTER careful consideration, MEPs in the European Parliament have voted to keep their £3,900-a-month taxpayer-funded (and tax-free) expenses a secret.Blow me down. Nobody saw that one coming.The generous expenses, known as the general expenditure allowance, or GEA, are paid as a lump sum into the MEPs salary, with no records kept, no receipts required and no questions asked. MEPs can spend it all on prostitutes and Ferrero Rocher chocolates if they want.Nobody cares.The GEA costs around £35million a year.And our corrupt continental cousins wonder why we’re leaving.DAVID Cameron received £800,000 to write his memoirs, which have been unexpectedly delayed until next year.Cameron should tell us why he made it legally binding for this country to spend £13billion a year on foreign aid, why he bombed Libya into the failed state it is today and how he blew £9million of public money on his pro-EU leaflet. And still lost!It also transpires that it was Cameron who begged Barack Obama to say, “The UK is going to be in the back of the queue,” if we dared to leave the EU.You shouldn’t be writing your memoirs, Mr Cameron.You should be writing us a letter of apology.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Of course, our security interests don’t begin and end at our borders, or even at the edge of Europe.Whether it’s Russia, Syria, Afghanistan or beyond, threats continue to emerge and develop around the world.After we leave the EU we will be free to pursue a truly independent foreign policy but that does not mean we will isolate ourselves from our neighbours.Under our proposals, we will continue to consult and co-operate with our EU partners on global issues.We will work with the EU on sanctions like those recently imposed on Russia, including co-ordinating them where it’s in our interests to do so.Our joint work on defence capability and space will continue. And we will decide where our armed forces and foreign aid could be used alongside the EU.Brexit has never been about turning our backs on Europe, pulling down the shutters and keeping ourselves to ourselves.Since well before the EU existed we have traded with and fought alongside allies around the world, and that won’t end when we leave next March.There’s still a lot of negotiating to be done. But our ambitious, effective proposal for a smooth customs arrangement and continued security co-operation is a huge step forward.It’s a good deal for Europe, and a good deal for Britain.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And we’re only at the start of what will be no doubt stormy negotiations for months to come.There remain serious questions about not just the compromise that Theresa May has forced on her Cabinet but on the final deal she plans to sign with Brussels.One, does it genuinely give us the ability to sign free trade deals across the rest of the world, strengthening our links with emerging markets and with the Commonwealth?Two, does it genuinely end freedom of movement, or does the woolly language in Downing Street’s statement still give people the chance to come here on the off-chance they might find a job?Three, can a future Government genuinely seek to diverge further away from the EU in certain areas without Brussels blowing the whole deal up, or charging us a king’s ransom to do so?If the answer to any of those is no, then the Prime Minister will never be forgiven.Not by her party and, as we report today, not by the public either.IT is astonishing that £13,000 of taxpayers’ cash has been dished out to allow a man serving life for murder to indulge his musical passions by staging a rock opera in jail.That’s money taken from the pockets of working families who have to scrimp and save because the taxman milks them at the petrol pump, the checkout till and in their paycheque.Why did the Arts Council think it appropriate to give the fruits of their labour to a monster like Graham Coutts?The law-abiding public deserve so much better.ENGLAND in a World Cup semi-final.

It is a White Flag.We will have a “Common Rule Book” — written by the EU and imposed by the European Court of Justice.These rules will torpedo any trade deal outside the EU. Immigration continues under a scheme which by any other name means free movement.This is not even Brexit In Name Only. It is zombie EU membership — and the UK is the zombie with no say in rule-making and paying through the nose for rule-taking.Of course, we need to be realistic. Compromises are inevitable since we made no plans for No Deal.Thanks to Mrs May’s election horror, the sums do not add up for Brexit. Remainers rule in the Tory Party, the House of Commons and the Lords.Without a heavyweight leader, Brexit Tories know they cannot raise the numbers to oust Mrs May. A failed challenge would only boost her new-found confidence and authority.Michael Gove and others argue a future Brexit Prime Minister — Mr Gove, for instance — could finish the job once we are legally Out.In fact, Britain tends to keep its treaty ­promises.We can’t even count on EU bully Michel Barnier to stir up a revolt. He and German Chancellor Angela Merkel will probably accept Mrs May’s deal, with a few tweaks, because they are effectively its co-authors.The Rule Book will keep us in line — no ­separate trade deals, no sovereign control over our borders, no escaping the ECJ.Brexit Cabinet ministers must accept some of the blame. They failed to force Mrs May when they had a chance to prepare for a No Deal Brexit. That failure instantly handed victory to the Remainers and to Brussels.Should we one day choose to make a clean break, we will face harsh “consequences” — what Boris vividly calls “punishment beatings”.But the biggest punishment beating will come from voters.If the Tories don’t care about the 17.4million who want Brexit, they will be made to care.Constitutional lawyer Martin Howe, a Tory QC, warns we are entering “a worst-of-all-worlds black hole Brexit where Britain is stuck ­permanently as a vassal state.”The fragile Tory lead over Labour has just evaporated. Almost 40 per cent of voters think the PM has betrayed the 2016 referendum result.Tories might not switch directly to Labour, but they won’t forget.

Please join me in praying for him and his family on this special day.The Lily Font and water from the River Jordan will be used during the baptism.Kensington Palace today revealed details of this afternoons christening, saying the guests would be served a slice of cake preserved from Prince William and Kate Middletons wedding day.A private tea will then be held at Clarence House.It comes after it was revealed Prince Harry has paid around £8,000 for a first edition Winnie-The-Pooh for his nephews big day.The 33-year-old newlywed plans to start an exclusive library for the young Prince, in tribute to his late mother, Princess Diana.A friend said: “One of Harry’s happiest childhood memories was being read a bedtime story by his mother.She loved all the old classics and Harry had the brilliant idea of starting a little library of first editions for Louis, Charlotte and George to enjoy as they get older.They added the doting uncle had originally wanted to get Lewis Carroll’s Through The Looking Glass, but decided on Winnie-The-Pooh."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT0004192040081.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"theresa may housing ministers slammed","story":"Kit Malthouse was given the post after Dominic Raab was promoted amid the Cabinet chaos to replace David Davis as Brexit Secretary.Mr Malthouse – elected in 2015 as MP for North-West Hampshire – becomes the fourth in the post since Theresa May took over in No.10 in mid-2016.And he’s the eighth Housing Minister since David Cameron’s coalition won power in 2010.The British Property Federation said that regardless of the political circumstances, the revolving door had to stop.Melanie Leech, the trade body’s chief exec, said: “The housing sector will be frustrated with yet one more housing minister.May 2010 – September 2012 Grant ShappsSep 2012 – Oct 2013 Mark PriskOct 2013 – July 2014 Kris HopkinsJuly 2014 – July 2016 Brandon LewisJuly 2016 – June 2017 Gavin BarwellJune 2017 – Jan 2018 Alok SharmaJan 2018 – July 2018 Dominic RaabJuly 2018 - Kit Malthouse“The national interest must come first.”Labour’s Shadow Housing Secretary John Healey added: “This is no way to run a Government. It’s clear the Conservatives can’t offer the leadership needed to fix the housing crisis.”The latest move comes just weeks before the expected publication of a new National Planning Framework. The Government is desperately trying to hit a goal of building 300,000 homes a year after seeing the housing crisis dominate last year’s Election.Brian Berry, chief exec of the Federation of Master Builders, stormed: “The Government claims that housing is a priority yet this constant chopping and changing in terms of the person leading the charge would suggest otherwise.”“The industry has long bemoaned the turnstile approach to this crucial role but the pace of change is quickening. We’re now going through two Housing Ministers a year.“Dominic Raab, Kit Malthouse’s predecessor, was only in post for a mere six months and before that, Alok Sharma was in the position for just seven months.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Then its likely youll be able to witness the spectacle.A special parade will march through The Mall in front of Buckingham Palace this morning at 11:25am as festivities get underway.The flypast is due to arrive at The Mall at around 1pm — finished off by a red, white and blue smoke-tail from the famous Red Arrows.Any position around the Thames in Central London should give you a prime view of the flypast.Among the best positions will be around Waterloo Bridge on the Southbank.The planes will be arriving from East London, meaning a clear space away from tall buildings.That makes Victoria Park a prime location to marvel at the flypast.The planes will head westward after passing over Buckingham Palace at 1pm.It means they will pass near Wimbledon, giving tennis spectators a chance to join in the celebration.The planes will splinter off into different directions after leaving West London.It means many will still get an opportunity to see at least part of the 100-strong flypast.They will head towards Heathrow, Runnymede, Windsor, Maidenhead and Hendon - so if you live in any of these areas then keep your eyes peeled.The cutting-edge stealth fighter F-35 jets are expected to feature - as are helicopters including the Puma, Chinook, Juno and Jupiter.Jets from the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight -

as are helicopters including the Puma, Chinook, Juno and Jupiter.Jets from the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight - the Dakota, Lancaster, Hurricane and Spitfire - will also be taking part."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT000419364621.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"plane giant airbus calls on brussels to scrap hardline brexit approach and accept theresa mays chequers plan","story":"The aircraft giant called on Michel Barnier and EU capitals to pursue a pragmatic and fair deal with the UK.Its boss Tom Enders told business leaders he was more optimistic about an agreement being struck following last weeks Chequers breakthrough.Speaking at the German-British Chambers of Commerce, he said: The Chequers statement appears to show the Government are going in the right direction.We are not shy to request that Brussels and our other home countries are similarly pragmatic and fair.”Airbus caused uproar last month when bosses warned the company would pull out of Britain in the event of a No Deal Brexit.Ministers furiously accused the manufacturer of making threats against the UK and said the warning was “completely inappropriate”.Mr Enders intervention will be seen as an attempt to redress the balance and show the company is not taking sides in the negotiations.The company has also been intensely lobbying both the EU Commission and the 27 Member States to ensure a good trade deal is done.Leading German MEP Hans-Olaf Henkel, former head of the Federation of German Industries, said it was time for Brussels to reciprocate the UKs offer.He told The Sun: It seems only logical that the closer the relationship remains, the less the damage will be for British and European businesses and for the jobs and wealth of its citizens.It is now up to the EU to accommodate demands for British industry and banks to admit that what is good for British business is also good for their continental counterparts.Dr Ulrich Hoppe, director-general of the German-British Chamber of Commerce, added that businesses had welcomed the Governments new plan.He told The Sun: We welcome that the British government has developed a unified approach for the negotiations on the future relationship between the EU and the UK.Such a unified position will allow for constructive negotiations in the coming months and years.Theresa May has warned Eurocrats it is time to get serious in the talks after the Cabinet agreed a proposal to closely align with the EU on goods regulations.The plan sparked the resignations of Brexit chief David Davis and foreign secretary Boris Johnson who said they could not support such a soft exit."},{"url":null,"title":"the big singalong flop","story":"Instead, it’s left to the commercial broadcaster and poor old Tony Hadley, reaching something close to climax, to sing a hymn of praise to this much-neglected national treasure.At which point, I think it’s probably time to drop the laboured sarcasm, because this next event may have been the point the cult of the NHS met its Waterloo.The Big Singalong Live, from Abbey Road Studios, where the disclaimers were heavier than Wednesday night’s rain as host Sara Cox quickly established: “This was not our idea, was it, Ashley (Banjo)?”“No, no it wasn’t.”The buck was being passed very much in the direction of the Lewisham and Greenwich NHS choir, who had come up with the perfectly ­reasonable idea of breaking television’s singalong record of 6,904 people, with a live version of The Beatles’ song With A Little Help From My Friends.Tireless and talented NHS heroes they may be, but for this thing to fly someone also clearly felt the process required some famous names to get on board.Normally, of course, this is the point when the public realises, “Ah, so it isn’t about us or the NHS at all. It’s about celebrities improving their image.”Oh, but what record-breaking names they’d assembled.Robbie, Adele, Elton, Ed Sheeran, Coldplay and Stormzy, were just a few of those who didn’t attend.Blue, Coleen Nolan, Amber Davies, from last year’s Love Island, UB40, Kimberley Walsh and Tony Hadley, on the other hand, were all involved, as was JLS’s Aston Merrygold, right, who said, on behalf of the NHS, he was: “Happy to clear my diary.”So we thank him and whoever covered the shift at Domino’s.Job demarcation, though, among the celebs, was a bit vague. A few just seemed to have backing track duties, like Kimberley Walsh who was given the line “What would you do if I sang out of tune?” (IF?)Some were enrolled for the full, record-breaking, Abbey Road finale, while others went on recruitment drives at UK hospitals, where Tony unearthed “the singing ambulanceman”, and Sara set her sights on Debbie “who’s pouring custard on a spotted Dick” — in the staff canteen, rather than the Infectious Diseases Unit.Eulogies to the great NHS god, though, were compulsory and delivered with a glassy-eyed, lip-quivering intensity that has become a very familiar sight these past few months.Good intentions, as we know, though, pave the road to hell. And so it proved with Wednesday’s Big Singalong Live, which kicked off with a parp of a klaxon, from Ashley, and Sara screaming: “Can we now please break that record.”Perhaps we can put what followed down to the swirling p***storm, in North London, or the lack of practice time — they only had six weeks — but, dear Lord in heaven — Russell Crowe didn’t unleash this much hell in Gladiator.Missed cues, frozen screens, flat voices, Tony Hadley giving it the big ’un, on the Abbey Road zebra crossing, with his “woh-oh ohhhs”.Seven thousand drunk Millwall fans chanting: “You’re going home in a London ambulance” could not have been much less unco-ordinated, but would undoubtedly have delivered an equally powerful message about the NHS.Salvation, though, was on hand in the form of Sara Cox.“The results are in and . . . (drum roll).“We almost made it, but it looks like the weather may have rained on our parade. We didn’t break the record.” A MASTERCLASS in scheduling, editing and continuity, from Channel 5, on Thursday night, that began with the very chirpy announcement: “We’ll find out What Happened to Josef Fritzl after brand new Nando’s, A PERi PERi Big Success . . . ”Which isn’t the first thing I associate Josef with, to be perfectly honest with you.

While dishevelled Boris used to proudly parade his baggy red shorts, his successor is suited and booted with proper running lycra.  Will it be a symbol of a change of government style?

The stubborn Prime Minister summoned her new-look Cabinet to make the decision today after she lost two top ministers in 24 hours - Boris Johnson and David Davis. The pair stormed out in a blaze of glory and spite over her new soft Brexit plan which Mr Johnson claimed would reduce Britain to a colony raising the white flag. He added the Brexit dream is dying. Last night Mrs May was hanging by a thread as she feared 48 Tory MPs would call no confidence in her - triggering a leadership contest. She is still in office after vowing to stay and fight any contest, rallying her backbenchers with a behind-closed-doors speech in Parliament and swiftly replacing her Brexiteer traitors with Dominic Raab and ambitious loyalist Jeremy Hunt.   But she is not out of the woods yet - with Brexiteer Tories warning she has two weeks to kill off her soft Brexit plans. Tory MP Andrew Bridgen fumed: The longer we have this preposterous and damaging policy, the more we will haemorrhage support. This has got to be killed and it’s got to be killed before recess. Last night dishevelled Boris Johnson finally slunk out of his ex-official residence in Carlton Gardens after hours of hiding from the media - his next move unknown. The Cabinet met this morning in Downing Street. A No10 spokesman said: Cabinet discussed the forthcoming publication of the white paper on the future partnership with the EU and also how no deal preparation work is to be stepped up.  Meanwhile Brexit Secretary Mr Raab and Foreign Secretary Mr Hunt were among the newly-promoted ministers who trooped up Downing Street this morning for the meeting. Others included the new Health Secretary Matt Hancock - who posed with the same NHS pin badge Mr Hunt used to wear. He was joined by Digital and Culture Secretary Jeremy Wright, who hasn\u0027t tweeted for years, and Attorney General Geoffrey Cox, Britain\u0027s richest MP who famously tried to claim 49p for milk. Mrs May ignited the chain of resignations by agreeing a major shift to soft Brexit at her country retreat Chequers on Friday.  The Prime Minister enraged Brexit-backers by agreeing a common rulebook between Britain and the EU for goods imported to the UK. Addressing MPs yesterday, Theresa May insisted: This is not a betrayal. But Brexit minister Steve Baker also quit along with a string of junior Tory government aides including Chris Green and Conor Burns. Theresa May agreed a major shift to soft Brexit at her country retreat Chequers - prompting her Brexit Secretary David Davis and Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson to quit. The \u0027third way\u0027 plan for UK customs rules proposed keeping the UK closely aligned with the EU in a new free trade area for goods. This will include sharing a common rulebook for all goods including agricultural and food products - and a possible compromise on migration. To appease Brexiteers, Parliament would keep the right to block future changes to the trading rules. But Brexiteers were enraged by this close link with Brussels and David Davis said this olive branch was meaningless in practice. The deal also proposes a common rulebook with the EU on state aid rules, and agrees to step up backup plans for a No Deal Brexit. A full White Paper was due to be published on Thursday 12 July. And Brexiteer ringleader Jacob Rees-Mogg said the plan was not Brexit amid reports he said Boris Johnson would make a brilliant Prime Minister. Yet hopes of ousting the Prime Minister appeared to be fading as senior ministers rallied round her today. Newly-promoted Jeremy Hunt - who once said Health Secretary would be his last big job in politics - said he was four square behind the Prime Minister. Solicitor General Robert Buckland said there had been a realisation that we all hang together or we all hang separately. Grandee William Hague backed Mrs May - with a warning to party ranks.  Lord Hague warned Tory rebels risk derailing Brexit if they follow romantics in resigning over Mrs May\u0027s plan - drawn up at a Chequers summit last week. The ex-leader said Tory MPs with pens hovering should know the chances that such resignations will lead to the sort of Brexit they desire are about zero. Lord Hague argued the Chequers deal was the only way of satisfying businesses, the Remain-leaning House of Commons and the problem of the Irish border. He added: A Tory faction becoming determined to oppose an agreement will put at risk not only the government but also Brexit itself. Another ex-leader, Brexiteer Lord Howard, warned against a bid to oust Theresa May, saying: I do think that it would be extremely foolish and extremely ill advised. The reshuffle leaves the four great offices of state - Prime Minister, Chancellor, Foreign Secretary, and Home Secretary - in the hands of ministers who voted Remain.  This will give Mrs May more authority to push through her new, softer plan, which she is refusing to drop. Justice Secretary David Gauke sounded the new note of caution with a warning against a no deal Brexit - just months before EU agreement is needed in October. He told the BBC: There are some who think this is pain free and this is just something that we can ride over very easily. No deal will have a negative impact on our constituents, on the British public. It is not an attractive option at all, which is why we should try to move these negotiations forward.

Kerry Cotterill and Matthew Gibson slept on benches and in parks after the tenancy ended on their home. The couple, from Cobridge in Stoke-on-Trent, say the only alternative accommodation the council offered them was in Walsall and Birmingham.  They slept out in the open from March to June of this year, reports Stoke on Trent Live .  But they were supported by Hanley Baptist Church which provided them with food, quilts and clothing and has now helped them land a Hanley home. It has brought the couple\u0027s four-month nightmare to an end. They have been in a relationship for four years, have no family living locally, and wanted to stay in the Potteries area.  Kerry, aged 34, said: “I was mortified when we lost our tenancy. I had always had a roof over my head and somewhere to go. I felt ashamed and angry. “We would sleep on a bench at Central Forest Park and we have slept out in the open at Fenpark. It was horrible, I don’t know how anybody can do it. “The first night on the streets was horrible. I broke down. I was screaming and trying to rip my hair out – I was literally breaking. I am thankful that we had each other. “The council offered us hostels and if I was on my own then I could have accepted the place. But I have to be with Matthew because of his mental health issues. They offered us places in Walsall and Birmingham but we wanted to stay here.  “I’m grateful to Hanley Baptist Church because without them we would still be homeless now. If it wasn’t for them we would have nowhere to go.” Matthew suffers with paranoid schizophrenia, unstable personality disorder, ADHD, anxiety and depression. The 30-year-old said: “When we lost our tenancy it felt like everything had come crashing down. I felt worthless and useless. Matthew suffers with paranoid schizophrenia, unstable personality disorder, ADHD, anxiety and depression.  The 30-year-old said: “When we lost our tenancy it felt like everything had come crashing down. I felt worthless and useless. “I promised Kerry that we would get somewhere and when we did I felt over the moon because Kerry is now safe at night and she has a roof over her head. I wouldn’t wish being homeless on anyone. The church has been fantastic and wonderful.” Council bosses say they helped Matthew get the tenancy at his former Cobridge home. In June, he missed an appointment with ARK Housing which was looking to get him accommodation. Councillor Randy Conteh, cabinet member for housing, said: “We understand that this situation is complex and we want to help him to secure accommodation as soon as possible.

David Clacy found his beloved 15-year-old daughter, Holly, dead at the spot in Essex last November after she took her own life. More than seven months on, the gas engineer has bravely spoken out about his heartbreaking discovery that winter\u0027s day. Speaking to Essex Live, he described how he screamed for help after coming across the harrowing sight of his daughter\u0027s body. He also recalled how he desperately tried to hold the teenager up, but because she was dead she was hanging over, she was limp.  It was just really surreal, he said of the moment he spotted Holly. From that day to now the only way I can describe it is I was looking through some glasses and it is like when you go to the opticians and they take the lenses away. They moved from one thing to surreal. Nothing made any sense at that point. I didn\u0027t know what on earth to do. Holly, from South Woodham Ferrers, sent a series of letters to her friends at school before taking her own life on November 20. Her mother, Lindsay, was first concerned that something was wrong when her daughter was late arriving home from school. Lindsay phoned David and a team was assembled to try to find her. The whole of South Woodham was out looking for Holly, but after hours of searching, her parents\u0027 worst nightmares came true.  Her dad discovered her dead at the top of the hill. It was too late to save her and it later emerged that she had killed herself. The community have since rallied round Holly\u0027s family. Below, David bears all on the moment he found Holly and how he wants to prevent this from happening to others in the future. November 20 started out like any other normal winter\u0027s day. David, who lives in South Woodham Ferrers, was sitting at home making Christmas decorations to sit in his window. He was looking forward to spending the festive season with his family. But then, the phone went. Lindsay had text me to say Holly hadn\u0027t come home, the dad recalled. I just said \u0027Well she’s a kid you know she’ll be home later.\u0027 Lindsay said \u0027No this is different, she has written letters. She has given letters to kids at school.\u0027 Holly, a pupil at nearby William de Ferrers school, had handed out several letters to her friends during the day. Concerned that something could be seriously wrong, David and Lindsay\u0027s eldest daughter sent out a Facebook appeal.  And the search to try to find the schoolgirl began. David, with his son, set out to try to figure out where Holly could be hiding, but initially couldn\u0027t find any sight of her. I went down there and could see immediately that Lindsay was upset and something was wrong so I just joined in with the general hunt because it had gone out on Facebook that she was missing, he said. I thought of all the places she could be hiding. I did one search with [my son] and went to the station, and we went all over really but couldn\u0027t find anything so I went back, left [my son] with his mum and told them I\u0027m going out again. David and a team of volunteers then focused their search mission on a hill in the area. It was odd really because I turned round and looked up at the tree at the top of the hill, said the dad. I kind of fancy I saw something but it was getting to be dusk and the tree was covered in leaves still so I turned round and went off. After the initial unsuccessful search, David returned to the spot to have an extra look. I went to all the places I thought she could have gone, he explained. I went where one of her friends is buried at the church, I went to the golf course and then I went back to [the hill] and then I said to her mum \u0027Don\u0027t worry, I\u0027ll find her and bring her back.\u0027  For some reason I turned left [at the hill] and that was the first time I found myself talking to her when I went up the hill. He recalled how he reached the top of the hill - which he hadn\u0027t yet been to but others had apparently searched for Holly. That’s when I found her in the tree, he said. He described how he frantically yelled for help and tried to hold his daughter up.  While I was up there screaming for help I could see people were walking up the hill as there were flashlights coming up and I was trying to hold her up but because she was dead she was hanging over, she was limp, he said.  I had to keep letting her go to go and run to the edge to shout to people to come. He added: Nothing made sense. For once I found myself at a bit of a loss at what to say or what to do. Holly was cut free from the tree and fell into the arms of a colleague of David\u0027s, who had ran all the way up the hill when he heard his screams. By then the police had been notified. The bottom of [the hill] was just a blaze of blue lights - everybody in the emergency services in Essex seemed to have turned out, said David.  Paramedics performed CPR in a futile attempt to resuscitate the schoolgirl, but she was pronounced dead at the scene. David, with the help of the doctor, carried Holly all the way down the hill on a stretcher before she was taken to Broomfield Hospital. The teenager\u0027s funeral date was set for December 12 - the day that she would have turned 16. Her younger half-sister Lilia had travelled from Surrey to visit the family, unaware of what had happened. The hardest part was telling a nine-year-old her older sister had killed herself, David said. She came in really excited to spend the weekend with us and was talking about her sharing a room with Holly. I sat her down and told her what happened - she just could not comprehend it. Sitting on his sofa in his flat on Clements Green Lane, David recalled how Holly\u0027s \u0027vivacious\u0027 and \u0027happy\u0027 personality never led him to believe she would take her own life. If a plane had landed on my head I would have been less surprised. It was a total shock, he said. Keen to keep the memory of Holly alive, David and his family organised a flower ceremony to take place at the spot where she took her life just six days after the incident. David has considered the idea of creating an anti-bullying mobile phone app following his beloved daughter\u0027s death. The app would pair a junior phone, the child\u0027s, to a senior phone, the parent\u0027s, so they would share data, Essex Live reports. This could curb potential cyber-bullying. David told the news site: One of the things that I learned from speaking to the police is the amount of children either being bullied, sent inappropriate material, and sending inappropriate material themselves. The idea is that if you had an eight-year-old child being bullied by someone and they could say to that bully ‘Sure, send me a text, send me any e-mails you like or anything else, but just bear in mind whatever you send me my dad is going to get it as well\u0027. I thought instantly an eight-year-old bully to an eight-year-old is a bully and they would be scared. But an eight-year-old bully would be more scared of a father. A phone is the most dangerous thing that you can give your kid – I’d like to see them give them the keys to their brand new BMW X4 and say \u0027have a little spin in that\u0027 and they wouldn\u0027t. But somehow a phone is acceptable. You have got to take away that responsibility from kids – how can you give them that responsibility? You can’t leave them with the phone and can’t take it off them so the only way is to take pressure off the children and get the parents to accept responsibility. The only way you can get parents to accept responsibility is if you get a system in place which allows them to do so. Around 200 people turned up to mark the occassion. David added: The community when they found out they brought these flowers to her school and I was looking at them and thinking eventually these are just going to die and be thrown in a skip. I thought I can’t have that so I looked at them and thought it was going to take me 20 trips to take them up the hill. He said there was a lot of paraphernalia and litter at the scene, so he and other relatives cleared it up. If we were going to have a flower ceremony we wanted to clear the area and tidy it up, he explained.  I put out on Facebook to say we were going to have a flower ceremony and asked if people would like to help. When we got to the top of the hill and looked down there were people still coming through from the gate to help. It was fantastic. It was at that ceremony where the seeds were sown for a new charity set up in Holly\u0027s name. David was approached by local businesswoman Sue Colvill, who wanted to organise a raffle.  They managed to raise \u0026pound8,000 at the raffle to raise money for benches which will sit at the top of the hill to create an \u0027oasis\u0027 where people can visit and look out over the town. BAE systems, an aerospace company that own the land, has kindly promised to gift some of its land for the benches. David explained: We wanted to give back to the community in some form. It will be somewhere peaceful to sit. As well as the benches, the Holly Clacy Foundation - run by a handful of volunteers from the South Woodham community - want to help prevent this from happening to other children in the area. David feels the pressures of modern-day life and the \u0027lack of will\u0027 among the political establishment pose a real threat for children. I thought that if only somebody had hired a village hall and asked me whether my daughter was happy but spiky sometimes, whether she is on a diet, if we find she overreacts to certain things at times, said the dad. If they listed all the qualities Holly had and then said your child might be in danger, I would want to listen to find out. This is what we think might be a good plan of attack for us now to think about doing here, to put together an evening with mental health care professionals, invite the people of South Woodham and get them to listen to the story. William de Ferrers School in Essex, which Holly attended, remains shocked and saddened by the death of the teenager. In a statement, a spokesperson for the school said the safety and wellbeing of its pupils is of paramount importance. They added that the tragic loss of the teenager will be felt within the school for the rest of its existence. The spokesperson said: William de Ferrers School continues to be shocked and saddened by the tragic death of one of our pupils, Holly Clacy. The school’s sympathies and thoughts remain with Holly’s family and friends and we will continue to do all we can to support them and our community in as many ways as possible. The safety and wellbeing of our pupils is of paramount importance, and such a tragic loss will be felt within the school for the rest of its existence. Our school recognises how difficult it is for young people to navigate the challenges of the modern world. To that end, the school has robust policies, processes and links to key external partners and works closely with any pupil who we know to be vulnerable, for whatever reason. These policies are reviewed annually and new policies are brought in as we learn from the experiences of our students. We seek to work closely with families, carers and our community to engage with and challenge attitudes, values and behaviours to allow our pupils to flourish and succeed, both in their studies and their emotional health and well-being. David hopes to see his idea come to fruition by passing an act in the House of Lords, and admits he will need a lot of help if the foundation is ever to achieve success. I\u0027m not a stupid person by any stretch of imagination but I am having to learn about things that I knew nothing about, he said. There are people out there that I know we can draw on - there is too much pressure on children and it has got to stop. Sue Colvill, who met David for the first time at the flower ceremony, has been instrumental in kick-starting the foundation, and has even managed to get a up-and-coming singer to be their patron. The Oakland Hotel paid for the singer David Barnes from The Voice to come down from Birmingham, she said. I was talking to him and asked how would he like to be our patron and he was more than happy to do so. Roger Bigwood, of BAE systems, said: I can\u0027t help but feel for any family who have gone through such a tragedy.

Becky Parry, 32, became unconscious just minutes after delivering a perfect baby boy in the pre-planned procedure, leaving her fighting for her life.  The fit and healthy cancer nurse suffered a cardiac arrest and three days later her life support machine was turned off at Northampton General hospital on June 6. Her heartbroken partner Brett, 32, is now the sole carer and a single dad to the couple\u0027s three children - Ashton, nine, Dolcie-Belle, five, and the newborn baby the couple named Hudson.  Five weeks later, Brett is struggling to come to terms with Becky\u0027s death.  He told the Daily Mail : Becky was perfectly healthy.  She went to hospital to give birth — and now no one will ever see her again. It doesn\u0027t seem real.  I still have her overnight bag from the hospital upstairs, still packed. I don\u0027t even want to open her wardrobe.  Each night, at 8.30, I put the kids to bed and I go to bed with them because there\u0027s no Becky to talk to, no one beside me on the settee, no one to share the silences with.  The couple had been together since they were teenagers. Becky\u0027s death has hit the family hard after she had a normal pregnancy and no problems while carrying Hudson. He was conceived nine months earlier on their honeymoon in Dubai. Brett was by Becky\u0027s side, holding her hand, when she gave birth on June 3. She just had time to smile before her condition worsened dramatically. Within moments the hospital\u0027s trauma team rushed in to help Becky who was struggling to breath and had a racing pulse. Eventually medics broke the news Becky had been starved of oxygen and would never recover.  Heartbreakingly, she didn\u0027t have a chance to hold baby Hudson before falling ill. Brett offered their children the chance to see their mum before her life-support machine was turned off but they refused, preferring to remember her as the happy and healthy mummy she was. Self-employed electrician Brett has described how hard he had found it to accept what happened to Becky who worked as a cancer nurse at the hospital she was treated in.

From the first time the world saw the Cambridge family in its entirety, to the adorable moment Kate was caught beaming down at her baby boy. However there was another incredibly sweet moment that anyone who wasn\u0027t inside the chapel will have missed. During the ceremony, Kate and William paid a lovely tribute to Diana. And they did it through music. The official details of the christening, published by Kensington Palace informed the public that the processional organ music was the song \u0027Rhosymedre\u0027.   This hymn may be familiar to some, as it was also played at Diana\u0027s funeral.  Back in 1997 the piece of music was played before the funeral service by Stephen Le Prevost, Assistant Organist at Westminster Abbey.  The music selected for the christening also held a special tie to Kate and William\u0027s wedding.  The couple chose to feature the anthem \u0027This is the day which the Lord hath made\u0027 during their son\u0027s welcome into the Christian faith.  This song was composed for The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge\u0027s wedding on April 29, 2011. The anthem was performed by The Choir of Her Majesty\u0027s Chapel Royal. After the short service the guests went back to Clarence House for a private tea, where pieces of Kate and William\u0027s wedding cake were served.  The christening marks the first time we\u0027ve seen Kate in public since the Trooping the Colour parade on June 9.

O let our cry come unto thee for those who fly o’er land and sea. Strong Son of Man, save those who fly. O Holy Spirit, God’s own power swift-winged across th’uncharted sky give peace in sudden danger’s hour: each anxious hour and lonely flight, bring calm of heart, and be thou near serene, unchallenged, day and night. to those who watch and those who fear. O’er land and ocean safely bear To thee will rise the grateful prayer all those in peril in the air. of those who serve thee in the air. O Trinity of love and grace, true guide of all who fly through space, in peace or war, mid friend or foe, be with them whereso’er they go. So shall our praise with heaven’s blend and joyful hearts to thee ascend.   Urbs Dei  I VOW to thee, my country, all earthly things above, entire and whole and perfect, the service of my love: the love that asks no question, the love that stands the test, that lays upon the altar the dearest and the best the love that never falters, the love that pays the price, the love that makes undaunted the final sacrifice. And there’s another country, I’ve heard of long ago, most dear to them that love her, most great to them that know we may not count her armies, we may not see her King her fortress is a faithful heart, her pride is suffering and soul by soul and silently her shining bounds increase, and her ways are ways of gentleness and all her paths are peace.  Arglwydd, arwain trwy’r anialwch  GUIDE me, O thou great Redeemer, Open now the crystal fountain pilgrim through this barren land whence the healing stream doth flow I am weak, but thou art mighty let the fiery cloudy pillar hold me with thy powerful hand: lead me all my journey through: Bread of heaven, strong Deliverer, feed me till I want no more. be thou still my strength and shield. When I tread the verge of Jordan, bid my anxious fears subside Death of death, and hell’s Destruction, land me safe on Canaan’s side: songs of praises I will ever give to thee. The readings   First reading by Air Commodore Mark Hunt reads from the Nave Pulpit  The task facing Rothermere and the new Air Council was a formidable one. No other fighting power established an independent air force during the war. There was (again) uncertainty about what the force should be called. Most of those involved talked and wrote about an ‘Air Service’. The legislation for the first time defined it as an ‘Air Force’, a term that had been used rarely. But because the Act had specified ‘His Majesty’s Air Force’ there was no possibility of adding ‘Royal’ without the King’s warrant. The Air Council wondered whether, like the Royal Navy, where the ‘Royal’ had been accepted by usage rather than royal approval, the Air Force could simply add 11 the extra adjective. Legal advice was sought to see whether or how the King might authorize the use of ‘Royal’, or to learn if it could be done informally without the King’s explicit consent. The title clearly mattered given the atmosphere of insecurity surrounding the new service, but the issues assumed an exaggerated importance. On 19th February the Council was informed that the King had happily consented to the title ‘Royal Air Force’, the name it has borne ever since. A royal warrant was prepared for the new service, and on 22nd March the King approved an Order in Council uniting the two air services and authorizing the transfer of personnel from the Navy and Army for a period not exceeding four years. After a complex gestation, the Royal Air Force was to be born ten days later, on 1st April 1918.   Second reading by Wing Commander Nikki Thomas reads from the Great Lectern  OH! I have slipped the surly bonds of Earth And danced the skies on laughter-silvered wings Sunward I’ve climbed, and joined the tumbling mirth Of sun-split clouds, — and done a hundred things You have not dreamed of — wheeled and soared and swung High in the sunlit silence. Hov’ring there, I’ve chased the shouting wind along, and flung My eager craft through footless halls of air… . Up, up the long, delirious burning blue I’ve topped the wind-swept heights with easy grace Where never lark, or ever eagle flew — And, while with silent, lifting mind I’ve trod The high untrespassed sanctity of space, Put out my hand, and touched the face of God. The lessons  First lesson by Air Chief Marshal Sir Stephen Hillier KCB CBE DFC ADC, Chief of the Air Staff, reads from the Great Lectern  TO whom then will you compare me, or who is my equal? says the Holy One. Lift up your eyes on high and see: Who created these? He who brings out their host and numbers them, calling them all by name because he is great in strength, mighty in power, not one is missing. Why do you say, O Jacob, and speak, O Israel, ‘My way is hidden from the Lord, and my right is disregarded by my God’? Have you not known? Have you not heard? The Lord is the everlasting God, the Creator of the ends of the earth. He does not faint or grow weary his understanding is unsearchable. He gives power to the faint, and strengthens the powerless. Even youths will faint and be weary, and the young will fall exhausted but those who wait for the Lord shall renew their strength, they shall mount up with wings like eagles, they shall run and not be weary, they shall walk and not faint.   Second lesson by The Right Honourable Theresa May MP, Prime Minister, reads from the Great Lectern  What more should I say? For time would fail me to tell of Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, of David and Samuel and the prophets—who through faith conquered kingdoms, administered justice, obtained promises, shut the mouths of lions, quenched raging fire, escaped the edge of the sword, won strength out of weakness, became mighty in war, put foreign armies to flight. Women received their dead by resurrection. Others were tortured, refusing to accept release, in order to obtain a better resurrection. Others suffered mocking and flogging, and even chains and imprisonment. They were stoned to death, they were sawn in two, they were killed by the sword they went about in skins of sheep and goats, destitute, persecuted, tormented—of whom the world was not worthy. They wandered in deserts and mountains, and in caves and holes in the ground. Yet all these, though they were commended for their faith, did not receive what was promised, since God had provided something better so that they would not, without us, be made perfect. Therefore, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, let us also lay aside every weight and the sin that clings so closely, and let us run with perseverance the race that is set before us, looking to Jesus the pioneer and perfecter of our faith, who for the sake of the joy that was set before him endured the cross, disregarding its shame, and has taken his seat at the right hand of the throne of God.

Myah Hauxwell, from Mansfield, Nottingham, was born with small eye syndrome, which had left her blind in one eye. Despite being fitted with a prosthetic eye when she was one, its weight caused her face to collapse. Myah underwent 10 operations at the Queens Medical Centre in Nottingham before doctors decided to create a new eye socket using her stomach fat. Her proud mum, Lauren, 31, was forced to wait an agonising four hours before she was told the operation was a success. Myah will now need to wait six months before her new eye socket is ready for another prosthetic - but that doesn\u0027t stop her from smiling. Lauren, a full-time mum, said: Surgeons used Myah\u0027s own stomach fat to build her a new eye socket.  As the socket is now her own fat tissue and is the size it\u0027s supposed to be, Myah hopefully won\u0027t need a new one created again. Myah had her first prosthetic eye - which is known as a shell - fitted when she was one year old. But although this made her face look symmetrical, it was too heavy for her face and it started to collapse last year. If we didn\u0027t have this surgery on June 27 Myah\u0027s face would have drooped down on one side for the rest of her life and she would have been in daily pain. Myah was constantly battling infections but surgeons have only used stomach fat that\u0027s 1mm thick so the new socket is really lightweight. This type of operation is rare and normally used as a last resort but Myah had no other option. I\u0027m so proud of her, she was awake and smiling just hours after the surgery. Myah was diagnosed with a disorder called microphthalmia - known as small eye syndrome - at just three days old. Lauren added: As soon as I saw her for the first time I knew something was wrong. Her one eye was sunken into her face and didn\u0027t appear to be working properly.  My whole world collapsed, I felt heartbroken that she only had one eye, none of my scans during pregnancy showed that anything was wrong. I still loved her unconditionally but I had no idea what the future held. She needed several surgeries during her first few months but she shocked us all when she was given her first prosethetic at one years old which was a year earlier than expected. Myah has never let having one eye hold her back and is always smiling and happy. We\u0027ve spent a lot of time in hospital and she has battled several infections but we\u0027re hoping this surgery will allow her to lead a normal life. The cause of Myah\u0027s small eye syndrome is unknown but Lauren couldn\u0027t be more proud by how she has coped. She said: Myah was even smiling before she went down to theatre.

The nightmare homes are being featured now after the sordid conditions that Catherine Purcell, 68, was kept in became public for the first time.  Shocking photos showing how Ms Purcell lived were part of a trial against her husband and daughter.  The court heard how Catherine died in a cesspit of her own faeces and bodily fluid which chemically destroyed her mattress and bed base, reports the Liverpool Echo.  Husband John Purcell, 72, and daughter Catherine Purcell junior, 35, were cleared of her manslaughter on July 5, at Liverpool Crown Court.  However they were found guilty of neglecting the disabled great-gran, who died while being eaten alive. A High Court judge handed him 18 months in prison, and Catherine Purcell jnr 12 months in prison, both suspended for two years. Graphic images showed the conditions of her home in the Merseyside town of Kirkby. But the Purcell\u0027s rancid property is just one of a number of house of horrors on Merseyside. Here is a look inside six other Merseyside homes and what officials were met with when their doors were opened.  Children forced to live in squalor  These graphic photos reveal a Wirral house of horrors where two children were forced to live in squalor. The alcoholic parents of the children, aged just three and six, were convicted of neglect in 2015 after police uncovered the faeces-littered hovel. The graphic photos reveal soiled linen, pillows and mattresses, dirty dishes piled high in the grubby kitchen and floors covered in rubbish.  Police were appalled after finding a bucket of stale urine in the kitchen, as well as what appeared to be faeces in an upstairs bedroom. Soiled nappies were left lying around the house and stale food had created a haven for germs to breed. The children were taken away from their parents, who cannot be named, after the intervention of social services. Describing the home as filthy and appalling, Judge Dennis Watson, QC, said: This was not something that occurred over night. This was something that developed and became the norm over a period of some months.  Real life Shameless family  This is the home of Ormskirk\u0027s real-life Shameless family who used their bath as a toilet. David Fyles was booted out of his council home in Lea Crescent in 2016 after town hall officers uncovered the house of horrors.  A bath was being used as a makeshift lavatory, because the actual toilet was blocked up with rubbish and mouldy food and piles of rubbish were strewn throughout the three-bedroom home. Doors were smashed off their hinges and neighbours reported how foul smells from the property emanated across the town\u0027s Scott Estate.  Rotting corpse found upstairs  A rotting corpse was discovered in a squalid Merseyside home from hell by health officers who joked: Have you got a dead body upstairs? Police and council officials were called to the house in Knowsley after locals raised concerns because the windows were covered in dead flies. They entered the rancid home to be confronted by an overbearing stench and saw an upstairs doorway surrounded by thousands of the insects.  The body of a man, the son of the homeowners, was found upstairs. Police arrested his sister and his parents on suspicion of concealing a body but charges were never brought. His sister, a mum-of-two, was later convicted of neglect as her two young children frequently stayed at her parents’ hovel home and were“exposed to risk of illness”. The woman was handed an 18-month community order.  Judge Stephen Everett said the punishment would have been sterner had police delays not impeded the case. He added: We will never know in the days or weeks following your brother’s death why nobody did anything.    Terrified dogs left in \u0027unbelievable conditions\u0027   Four dogs, one with a broken leg, were found in a sweltering property in Upton. Woody along with his brother, Duncan, and parents, Patch and Lucy, were found in conditions RSCPA inspector Anthony Joynes described as a house of horrors. The dogs were seized by the RSPCA after concerns were raised over their welfare.    The house had oil heaters turned on full blast, had no carpets, holes in the floor and was cluttered with piles of clothing.   Playground for rats and flies  A Toxteth man hoarded so much junk that his house became a playground for rats and flies. Bill Berry, 55, could not move around his house which was filled to the brim with years of takeaway boxes, newspapers and rubbish. He was eventually unable to get upstairs so ended up sleeping on the sofa. Bill told the ECHO about his ordeal after beating his disorder with help from Liverpool Housing Trust (LHT). He told how his hoarding began after he suffered with depression from being bullied and unhappy at work.   Dogs left to die in agony  Owner Andrew Davies failed to tell anyone her ‘Labradoodle’ cross-breeds, named Koda and Hachi, were in her former property, in Walton, after she moved in with her mum and sister. RSPCA Inspector Helen Smith, called to the house by the landlord on August 8, 2016, was confronted by a grim scene. She found the bodies of the dogs, who were brothers, decomposing in the kitchen of the filthy property – next to empty water bowls.

She joined the Queen, Prince William, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex and the rest of the gang for a service at Westminster Abbey to mark the occasion. Technically Kate is on maternity leave after giving birth to her third child Prince Louis back in April. So technically she doesn\u0027t have to attend this kind of official event and has been missing from several key things in the last few months. But the mum-of-three decided to break her leave for today\u0027s celebrations, and there\u0027s a very lovely reason why.  The organisation means a lot to Kate and she was made Honorary Air Commandant back in 2015, taking over the role from Prince Philip. It is understood she felt the celebrations were important to intend if she could, and it seems she felt up to it.  She showed how proud she is to be a part of the organisation by wearing the RAF Dacre Brooch .  Of course it\u0027s not the first time we\u0027ve seen her and she has broken her maternity leave several times since welcoming little Louis into the world.  Last month she attended Trooping of the Colour, the Queen\u0027s annual birthday parade. She arrived by carriage for the celebration and joined the rest of the royal family on the Buckingham Palace balcony for the flypast. Kate wore a lovely blue Alexander McQueen dress for the occasion with a hat by Juliette Botterill. We\u0027ve also seen her at Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0027s wedding and Prince Louis\u0027 christening, but these are personal events not official occasions.

She has it proudly pinned to the front of her baby blue Alexander McQueen coat, which she wore with a hat by Sean Barrett. Kate attended today\u0027s event despite being on maternity leave, and it is understood she felt the celebrations were important to attend if she could.  Kate was appointed an Honorary Air Commandant in 2015, taking over the role from the Duke of Edinburgh. The brooch used to be given to the best female cadet every year and it was the highest honour they could recieve. However in 2015 the tradition was changed when it was decided women should be recognised in the same way as their male peers - with a sword. The organisation decided to give the brooch to Kate as a gift to celebrate her new role.  Lucinda Conder was the last cadet to be awarded the brooch in 2015.  Speaking at the time, she told the  : \u0027It is quite an honour (to wear the brooch)  I was the last cadet to wear it, and now she is wearing it. It is the best accessory.

The new Duke and Duchess of Sussex will spend two days in the Irish capital, arriving later this afternoon where they will meet the Taoiseach Leo Varadkar. The couple are travelling at the behest of the government, but have told aides they hope to meet as many Irish people and get a real feel for places and organisations “central to Irish Life”. The royal couple were both present at Prince Louis’s christening yesterday at the Chapel Royal at St James’ Palace and are attending a morning service celebrating 100 years of the RAF at Westminster Abbey. Tonight they will attend a summer garden party at the British Ambassador\u0027s residence in Ireland, where they will meet people from across Ireland\u0027s arts, sports, military and social enterprise sectors.  For Harry, 33, it will be his first visit to southern Ireland - but Meghan, 36, has already visited as an ambassador for the One Young World summit in 2014. In May 2011 The Queen made the first visit to the Irish Republic by a British monarch in 100 years. There she won praise for a speech at the state dinner in Dublin Castle and paid a silent tribute at the national garden of remembrance to those killed fighting the British for Irish independence. In April 2014, President Michael D. Higgins reciprocated the Queen\u0027s visit when he became the first Irish president to make a state visit to the UK. During their visit to Dublin, Meghan and Harry will take time to “learn about Ireland\u0027s culture and heritage”, including a visit to Trinity College, where they will see the Book of Kells, one of Ireland\u0027s greatest cultural treasures.  The Book of Kells is a Gospel book in Latin dating back to 800AD. Their historic trip will include a visit to a Gaelic sports festival at Croke Park, the home of the Gaelic Athletic Association. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex will also have a moment for reflection at the Famine Memorial, before visiting EPIC, the Irish Emigration Museum, which tells the story of the 10 million Irish people who have emigrated across the world. The Famine memorial was built to remember the Great Famine in Ireland during the mid 19th century. A royal source said: “Harry and Meghan have thrown themselves into royal duties straight after their wedding and have made no secret of how they plan to do as much as possible together on the global stage. “They are both really exited about seeing all Ireland has to offer.” "},{"url":null,"title":"meghan markle debuts new royal","story":"NewsMeghan Markle debuts new \u0027royal\u0027 item at Prince Louis\u0027 christening - and it might be a nod to QueenMeghan Markle joined Prince Harry and the rest of the royals for Prince Louis\u0027 christening\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByZoe ForseyAudience Writer09:31, 10 JUL 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMeghan Markle looked lovely when she joined her new in-laws for Prince Louis\u0027 christening.  She opted for an olive green Ralph Lauren dress with a matching hat by milliner Stephen Jones and pointed court shoes.  Fashion fans were loving her understated but chic look, saying it was the perfect christening look. But she debuted a new accessory for the occasion - and it\u0027s a very royal addition. And there\u0027s a chance her new look might be a nod to the Queen.  Along with her handbag and order of service, Meghan was carrying a pair of matching green gloves. We didn\u0027t see her wearing them at any point, but there\u0027s a chance she might have put them on for the service itself or official photos. Obviously it\u0027s been rather hot outside for the last few days, so we assume she wasn\u0027t wearing them to keep warm. So she might be copying the Queen, who always wears gloves for public occasions and carries a pair in her bag.  As well as being a part of her signature style, it\u0027s believed she wears them for hygiene reasons as she meets and shakes hands with so many people. The Queen has been buying her gloves from Cornelia James for more than 70 years, and she\u0027s said to repair rather than replace them when they break.

The royal family were all at his side, bar the Queen and Prince Phillip who couldn\u0027t attend due to health reasons, according to Kensington Palace.   Meghan and Prince Harry attended along with Prince Charles, Pippa Middleton and Camilla.   There are no official christening photos yet, but some were taken after the service by Matt Holyoak at Clarence House. They\u0027re expected to be released over the next few days - Princess Charlotte\u0027s were released the Thursday after her christening.  The christening was the first public appearance the Cambridges has made as a family of five, with Prince William and Kate bringing along brother Prince George and sister Princess Charlotte.  Here are the best photos from Prince Louis\u0027 christening as the guests arrived and left.  Our first look at Prince Louis  We got our first look at little Prince Louis who was peacefully sleeping in mum Kate\u0027s arms as the family arrived at the Chapel Royal. She joked: I hope he stays like this!  Louis had been kept out of the spotlight since he was born on April 23, 11.01am at St Mary\u0027s Hospital, London. Royal babies are usually christened two or three months after they\u0027re born.  The Cambridges arrive The Duchess of Cambridge wore a cream Alexander McQueen dress and Jane Taylor hat as she arrived with Prince Louis in her arms. She was all smiles as she entered the chapel after greeting the Archbishop, Justin Welby. Prince Louis wore the traditional gown, a replica of the royal gown dating back 177 years. The original was commissioned by Queen Victoria for her daughter Victoria, and was made of delicate silk and Honiton lace. The replica is made by Angela Kelly, dressmaker to the Queen. After the christening of Prince Edward\u0027s daughter Louise in 2004 it was decided that the original gown was too delicate to be worn.  Princess Charlotte and Prince George held on to dad William\u0027s hands as they entered the chapel in matching blue outfits.  Prince Louis\u0027 Christening guests and godparents  The Duke and Duchess of Sussex leaving the chapel - Meghan Markle wore an olive green Ralph Lauren dress with a matching hate and pumps. Green symbolises unconditional love.  Harry chose a navy blue suit matching the colour scheme for the day. The pair are set to attend the RAF flypast this afternoon before flying to Ireland for their royal visit.   Pippa Middleton wore a pale blue Alessandra Rich dress - she arrived with husband James Matthews, who also wore blue. Pippa is expecting her first child in autumn and her small bump was visible in her dress.   This was also the first time we\u0027ve seen all five of the Cambridges together as a family. Kate, Will, George, Charlotte and Louis made their first appearance together as a family of five.   While the Queen and Prince Phillip couldn\u0027t make the service Prince Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles attended the service - they arrived before the Cambridges. As Camilla left later on she fanned herself suggesting it was a tad too warm in the chapel for her!   James Middleton, Kate\u0027s younger brother, arrives in a navy suit.  The Middletons arrived wearing blue co-ordinated outfits to the chapel. Guy Pelly, one of the godparents and long-term best mate to Will and Harry, arrived just before the service too.   The Duchess of Cambridge\u0027s cousin Lucy Middleton, Hannah, godparent and schoolfriend of Kate\u0027s with her husband Robert Carter and Harry Aubrey-Fletcher (back) were snapped arriving for the christening of Prince Louis. They were chosen as godparents along with Nicholas van Cutsem, a close friend of William and Harry. William is godfather to his daughter Grace.   Godparent Lady Laura Meade also attended with her husband, James, who went to Eton with William. James is also godfather to Charlotte.  It\u0027s traditional for the royals to have a lot of godparents, William had six and George has seven.   Kate and Will leave the Chapel with George and Charlotte  George and Charlotte were led out of the chapel as the service ended. Princess Charlotte waved to photographers as she held the order of service. She cheekily told them: you\u0027re not coming! as she passed by the press. The little girl wore a blue smock dress.

The three-year-old was walking hand-in-hand with dad Prince William outside the chapel when she made eye contact with a member of the press - and hilariously did not drop her gaze. Clutching an order of service, the little princess stared curiously at the media before declaring: You\u0027re not coming. Charlotte\u0027s confident nature has charmed the public many times before. From waving delightedly to royal fans outside uncle Harry\u0027s wedding ceremony and skipping gleefully at a polo event with mum Kate, the tot has proved to be excellent value. Before entering the Royal Chapel at St James\u0027s Church, in London, yesterday, she shook the Archbishop of Canterbury\u0027s hand and appeared quietly happy with herself when her dad said well done.  Why Meghan Markle isn\u0027t godmother to Prince Louis - and why she isn\u0027t being snubbed   Prince Louis of Cambridge was on his best behaviour for his christening - much to the relief of the Duchess of Cambridge. The 11-week-old prince was sound asleep as he was carried into the chapel by his mother Kate. As the duchess chatted to the Archbishop of Canterbury while holding Louis, she could be heard describing her sleeping son as very relaxed and peaceful. The duchess added, with a smile: I hope he stays like this. Following the 40-minute ceremony, the baby prince looked content and wiggled his fingers as Kate gazed down and beamed at him as she held him in her arms. Prince George and Princess Charlotte joined their parents for Louis\u0027s big day at the chapel at St James\u0027s Palace in London. It is the first time the Cambridges have been seen together as a family of five.    Baby Louis was dressed in the cream, frilly lace royal christening gown - a replica of the intricate robe made for Queen Victoria\u0027s eldest daughter in 1841. Among the guests in the oak-panelled chapel were Louis\u0027s aunt and uncle the Duke and Duchess of Sussex. Meghan looked stylish in an olive-green Ralph Lauren outfit and Stephen Jones hat, and held hands with her husband of less than two months as they arrived. The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh were missing from the small family affair. The decision is understood not to have been taken on health grounds, and to have been mutually agreed by the Queen and the Cambridges some time ago. The Queen, 92, has a busy week ahead, with high-profile celebrations in central London marking the centenary of the RAF on Tuesday, and a visit by US President Donald Trump in Windsor on Friday. The Duke of Edinburgh, 97, has retired from public duties.  The prince\u0027s six godparents took part in the service, including Louis\u0027 godfather Guy Pelly - who was once dubbed William and Harry\u0027s court jester for his wild ways. Louis\u0027s other godparents are: Nicholas van Cutsem - one of the van Custem brothers, who are long-time family friends of William and Harry Harry Aubrey-Fletcher, who went to Ludgrove School and Eton with William Lady Laura Meade, who is married to William\u0027s close friend James Meade Kate\u0027s Marlborough schoolfriend Hannah Carter (nee Gillingham) and the duchess\u0027s cousin Lucy Middleton. There for the ceremony were Louis\u0027s grandfather the Prince of Wales, step-grandmother the Duchess of Cornwall and maternal grandparents Carole and Michael Middleton. Guests including Kate\u0027s brother James Middleton, and Kate\u0027s pregnant sister Pippa with her husband James Matthews - the brother of former Made In Chelsea star Spencer Matthews - joined the royals for tea at Clarence House afterwards. William and Kate served slices of fruit cake taken from the top tier of their wedding cake.  Pippa Middleton was showing a hint of her baby bump during the christening service she attended with husband James Matthews.  According to reports the couple are expecting their first child in October and the birth will come just under 18 months after their wedding in May last year.

But the hot weather can also have a serious impact on your car’s performance – and could leave you stranded if you’re not aware of the risks. Below we\u0027ve teamed up with Halfords to reveal what you can do to stop any problems arising this summer. These tips should be a big help as you\u0027re about to head off on your summer holiday or any long journey, especially given the current heatwave. How hot can my battery get?  When it comes to car batteries (and any other battery, actually), heat is the enemy. Temperatures up to 30 degrees celsius are absolutely fine, but don\u0027t forget that it\u0027s not just the ambient temperature that matters here. Your car battery is usually kept in the engine bay, under a metal bonnet where heat can build up. Factor in running the car and that the liquids in the battery can get quite hot – especially in this British heatwave. It’s this heat that can cause unexpected problems with your battery and might, eventually, lead to your car breaking down. Dirt and corrosion on your car battery terminals can cause it to operate less efficiently and may also shorten its lifespan. It\u0027s worth inspecting your battery when you check your oil levels (or even more often), to ensure that the terminals are clean. Make sure you know how to do this safely, if not pop in to Halfords for a Free Battery Check and an expert will inspect it for you. Too much heat can cause the liquid in the battery to evaporate, which can damage the battery permanently. Inside the battery are some lead plates, in high temperatures these can corrode and cause the battery to operate less efficiently. What can you do to keep your car cool One tip is to avoid parking your car in direct sunlight which can create significant temperatures under the bonnet. When your engine is running, and the car moving, the engine bay gets air blown through it to help cool components. The fan will also help with this, and in hot spells you might notice it runs even when the engine isn\u0027t running. If you’re worried about the human occupants, get the Halfords All Weather Windscreen Shield, \u0026pound7.99, to stop the interior of your car heating up too much. When should you change your car’s battery? You can expect a decent car battery to last around three to five years. If the battery is stressed by extremes of temperature then you may see some reduction in that. Check when your battery was installed if possible and consider replacing an old one so it doesn\u0027t let you down when you need it most. The key factor in a car battery is the current it can output in normal use. If this is too low then you’ll notice it get harder to start the car. You may also notice some electrics stop working – keep an eye on the electric windows, radio and for dim lights.

In an audio clip released by Greater Manchester Police , the unnamed woman claims she needs to report a crime.   She complains that she booked a brow tint but says the beautician failed to do an allergy test for the dye, the Manchester Evening News reports.  Unsurprisingly, she was quickly shut down by the call handler who told her it was not a police emergency. This call was one of more 8,000 to the force over the weekend – the highest number in two years. The woman complaining about her eyebrows said: “Hi there darling. I need to report a crime please.” The call handler replied: “Yes, what’s happened?” Beginning to explain her situation, the woman says: “Basically what it is, I’ve gone and had my eyebrows done yesterday. “I’ve rang her and asked her if she’s got any appointments to have my eyebrows tint and plucked. “I’ve gone there basically and she’s hurt me and she’s done my eyebrows without a skin patch test.”  At that point, the call handler interrupts. She tells the woman: “That does not sound like a police emergency, this sounds like a trading standards complaint. “If you’re not happy with the procedure go to trading standards, okay?” The woman replies: “Yeah, no problem. “If you ain’t gonna deal with it I’ll deal with it,” she adds, before hanging up. Police are urging people to think twice before calling following unprecedented demand at the weekend. From 7am on Saturday to 7am on Monday, the force received 5,229 calls to 999, and 3,121 to 101.

Up to three of the multimillion-pound warplanes could feature in the huge flypast set to roar above the Mall and Buckingham Palace on July 10. The Queen will be joined by family members including the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall, the Duke of Cambridge and the Duke and Duchess of Sussex for today\u0027s events. Celebrations will begin with a service at Westminster Abbey from 10.30am, with the flypast over Buckingham Palace at 1pm, followed by a reception. Along with Charles, the Queen will present a new Queen\u0027s Colour to the RAF in the forecourt of Buckingham Palace before making a brief speech. The royals will then appear on the balcony of Buckingham palace to see the flypast of up to 100 RAF aircraft, a parade of more than 1,000 personnel, and a feu de joie (a rifle salute). Charles, Camilla, William, Harry and Meghan will also meet veterans, personnel, charity representatives and those from the civil service in a reception after the spectacle.  If you want to be in the heart of the action, head to The Mall in London where the RAF will be hosting a very special parade kicking off at 11.25am. The officer commanding 617 squadron, Wing Commander John Butcher, is set to fly an F-35 during the spectacle, and said for him personally it is very important for the jets to feature. That will be the first that we will have flown it in a public environment since we landed back, so it is an exciting opportunity, he said. Now we just need to make sure the jets are in a good place to fly.  Four of the supersonic jets, which had been based at US Marine Corps Air Station Beaufort, South Carolina, crossed the Atlantic last month. They are now permanently based at RAF Marham in Norfolk, with another five of the jets expected to arrive in the UK by the end of July to the beginning of August. Quizzed on how likely it is the jets will take part, Wg Cdr Butcher said he is hopeful that at least one jet will feature in the formation - but serviceability and the weather could affect numbers. It is very early days for us, we are still learning to operate back at our main operating base, so there are many factors at play that could prevent us from doing it, he said.

Because for all the benefits our digitised lives bring us, we\u0027re also only ever a click away from some really, really bizarre - and possibly dangerous - so-called guidance. Take peegasms for example.  Also known as the p**s shivers, this is an example of a harmful trend which should never have seen the light of day.  So what it is a peegasm? It all began when one man asked other women if they\u0027d ever had mini orgasms from peeing after holding it in.   My girlfriend recently told me if she\u0027s had to hold her pee in for a while, when she actually goes to pee, she often has orgasms that she feels all the way up her spine to her head, he explained on Reddit .  If she does \u0027reverse kegels\u0027 while peeing, they\u0027re even more likely to happen. Sounds bizarre, right? Well, this man\u0027s girlfriend is by no means alone in her discovery. I call them the p**s shivers because they’re not quite orgasmic in my opinion but close enough, one woman responded.  Another added: I get something similar, but it’s not exactly an orgasm, just a really, really pleasurable feeling. I can do it by letting go for a split second and holding it in. It feels so good that I start tearing up. Then, when I finally do go pee, I get these delicious full body shivers. Should you try this at home? The answer to this would be a big, fat juicy no. Not unless you really enjoy the sting of a UTI.  This \u0027practice\u0027 would be most unwise, Dr Clare Morrison, GP at MedExpress , told Cosmopolitan .

To protect the locals, the 60-year-old crocodile was removed from the Katherine River and moved to live out the rest of its days in a crocodile farm. It was a close contender to the largest crocodile ever captured in Australia, which measured 21ft - which as caught and killed in 1974, also in the Northern Territory. But this capture wasn\u0027t a simple task. The rangers had been tracking the creature since they first spotted it in 2010.  The reptile, which is the same length as a Volkswagen Beetle, was worryingly near the town of Katherine, just 37 miles downstream. Tracey Duldig, acting director of the Department of Tourism and Culture said: He was removed downstream from Katherine to help prevent human interaction in the more populated areas,   He has been taken to a croc farm in the Katherine region. Known for its exotic and sometimes dangerous wildlife such as sharks and Tasmanian devils, Australia is home to over 150,000 crocodiles. For the protection of residents and tourists, the Australian authorities reguarly track and move crocodiles to secure enclosures.

Bernd Grotsch, 47, was found dead at his home in the heart of the jungle on the notorious island of Koh Tao on June 17. The German had recently returned to the island \u0027to tie up some loose ends\u0027 with his 20-year-old motorbike rental business. His family, who described him as \u0027fit\u0027 and \u0027healthy\u0027, claim authorities told them he died of “heart failure” or had been “bitten by a snake”. But they say they haven\u0027t received an autopsy report and believe there is something more sinister behind his death.  The family, from Ingolstadt, Germany, have also complained about his body being sent to the same Bangkok hospital that carried out botched reports on the bodies of Hannah Witheridge and David Miller. The pair were murdered on the same island in 2014. Experts across the world slammed the DNA testing done by the hospital at the time - amid claims it was tampered with in order to scapegoat two Burmese workers currently on death row over the killings. Mr Grotsch\u0027s cousin Christina told The Sun the were no explanation for the death of the dad at his home in Mae Haad. She said: He was fit, healthy and happy. We do not trust the authorities in Thailand, especially since there are some oddities.  To date, no autopsy results have been obtained, only vague explanations and conjectures about an alleged deadly bite by a poisonous snake. Or heart and circulatory failure, without further evidence. Christina claimed the family were initially told Mr Grotsch\u0027s body had been returned to the mainland in Surat Thani. But when they checked again it was still in a temple on Koh Tao. They allegedly put pressure on the German Embassy in Bangkok, and eventually the body was moved three days later. They family had wanted forensic scientist Dr Pornthip Rojanasunand to perform the autopsy as she is seen worldwide as a respected independent forensic physician, according to the newspaper.  However, his body was instead taken to the Institute of Forensic Medicine, which is where the bodies of Miss Witheridge and Mr Miller were taken. Wealthy entrepreneur Mr Grotsch had moved to the island two decades ago, but left in 2016. He started another business on the island of Koh Phayam, before returning earlier this year to tie up loose ends. He had recently split from wife and Koh Tao native, Oey, with whom he has a seven-year-old daughter, Bene. Mr Grotsch is the tenth known foreigner to die in suspicious circumstances on the \u0027death island\u0027 in just six years. Below, we look at the previous cases. 2012 Brit Ben Harrington , 32, died on the island after his motorbike apparently crashed into an electricity pylon.  His mother Pat Harrington did not accept the explanation by Thai police and has spent years fighting for information from the Thai authorities about her son\u0027s death, including submitting Freedom of Information requests to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. Mrs Harrington said she is suspicious of the explanation and had to fight to prevent his body being quickly cremated: [Thai authorities] wanted to cremate Ben the next day, but I screamed and shouted and it was stopped. I had awful problems getting anyone on the phone at first. 2014 Brits Hannah Witheridge and David Miller were murdered as they walked back to their hotel rooms in September 2014. Hannah, 23, from Hemsby, Norfolk, and David Miller, 24, from Jersey, were found dead on Koh Tao on September 15.  Post-mortem examinations showed that the young backpackers, who had met on the island while staying at the same hotel, both suffered head wounds and that Hannah had been raped. Zaw Lin and Wai Phyo were sentenced to death for the killings. But although David\u0027s family called the verdict \u0027justice\u0027, the trial of the two Burmese migrant workers was plagued by accusations of human rights abuses. Nick Pearson , 25, from Derby, was found floating in the sea on New Year\u0027s Day 2014.  His parents believe he was murdered - despite police claims he fell 50ft and drowned. The 25-year-old\u0027s mum Tracey told a documentary about the island she would warn parents not to allow their children to travel to the island. 2015 Christina Annesley , 23, died on the island in January 2015 after apparently mixing antibiotics she was taking for a chest infection with alcohol. But the British holidaymaker\u0027s parents slammed Thai authorities for failing to investigate the death.  Christina, from Orpington, South East London, died shortly after arriving on Koh Tao. Her dad Boyne said a toxicology report was not carried out. Frenchman Dimitri Povse , 29, was found hanged in a bungalow on the island on New Year\u0027s Day 2015 and his death was ruled as suicide despite his hands being tied behind his back. Associate Professor Charnkanit Krittiya Suriyamanee, a criminologist and lecturer at the faculty of social science and humanities of Mahidol University, said he doubted the suicide theory citing some irrelevant evidences, according to Chiangrai Times .  He said that the victim had been drunk to the extent that he was unable to control himself, he would not have been able to tie himself up so tightly that he died of suffocation. He also noted several other odd finds. 2016 Luke Miller, a bricklayer from the Isle of Wight, was found dead in a swimming pool at the Sunset Bar at Sairee Beach on January 8 2016, with an inquest earlier this month finding no evidence he was murdered. He was discovered floating in the water by a member of hotel staff, with his death coming just days after a tragic final Facebook post on New Year\u0027s Eve, in which he said: Can honestly say this new year I am living the dream.  Thai police said a post-mortem examination showed he drowned. But, his sister Maria and the family told the BBC they would not rely on what Thai police said as there was still speculation over the circumstances surrounding the death - and that they had received \u0027different versions\u0027 of what might have happened. 2017 Belgian Elise Dallemagne was found dead and half-eaten by lizards having apparently hanged herself on the island - an explanation rejected by her family. The young backpacker had been living at a yoga and tantra retreat, which neighboured the party island of Koh Phangan, in between travelling round Asia, for two years. She was part of the sect of the Sathya Sai Baba cult movement, and lived with a self-proclaimed guru, and left Koh Phangan on April 17 to return home.  Elise then used a fake name of Elise Dubuis to check into the Triple B Bungalows next to Mae Head Pier on Koh Tao as she travelled via the island on a ferry bound for Chumphon province on her route back to capital Bangkok. But an unexplained fire that evening burned down three bamboo huts - including the one Elise had been staying in. Elise fled 2.5km to through the jungle to Tanote Bay and took a room at the Poseidon Resort where she booked another ticket for Bangkok leaving on April 24. Eight days later when locals living near the island\u0027s idyllic Tanote Bay became suspicious of a monitor lizard going back and fourth into the jungle they discovered Elise\u0027s half-eaten body on May 27 among rocks behind the Tanote Family Bay Resort.

Sara Zagidullina, 17, was attacked by Aleksandra Dulesova and three other young women when they discovered she was seeing a boy identified only as “Igor”, according to police. The shocking ordeal began when the perpetrators broke into Sara\u0027s home, reportedly shaving her head, then forcing her to perform oral sex on them before taking turns urinating on her. After dragging the naked young woman to the bathroom, they allegedly turned the water as hot as possible, inserting the shower hose into her vagina.  Shakira Pellow: \u0027Awful\u0027 final picture of schoolgirl in hospital bed her family want you to see   Police say the ordeal, which lasted for hours, could have killed Sara, who was left in agony on the bathroom floor, while the attackers ransacked her home, stealing money, a laptop and a mobile phone as well as other valuables. Using her last bit of strength, the victim managed to raise the alarm, and was rushed to hospital. There, doctors sadly confirmed that her womb had been badly damaged by the hot water and that she was now sterile.  The incident happened in central Russia\u0027s Perm Krai region in the town of Gubakha after Igor allegedly dumped 17-year-old Aleksandra after she told him she was pregnant. He is then believed to have started a new relationship with Sara, who knew nothing about his past until she was confronted by the angry ex. Aleksandra reportedly warned her victim with the ominous phrase: Leave us alone or I will kill and bury you!  She then gathered her friends Kristina Poyarkova, 16, Maria Sheputaeva, 16, and Anastasia Voronchikhina, 20, allegedly bursting into the victim’s at where they subjected her to the terrifying torture ordeal. Three of the attackers have been arrested and taken into custody, while Aleksandra is under house arrest due to her pregnancy. The four suspects filmed Sara\u0027s torture on their phones and police have found the video, according to reports. All have been charged with sexual abuse and torture of a minor committed by a gang and could face up to 15 years in prison if found guilty.

He was always the same nice lad.“I think that was one of the strengths of the Dundee team that won the championship – we were all good friends. There were no cliques in the dressing-room and none of us let our success go to our heads.“I remember when Alan was at Spurs and I was manager at Hearts, we played them in a friendly. He was a big star, but he was exactly the same as he was when we were at Dens.”“Gillie” scored a club record 169 goals in 190 appearances in dark blue and, after leaving for London in 1964, went on to earn similar legendary status at White Hart Lane, where he formed lethal striking partnerships with Jimmy Greaves and Martin Chivers. None of that came as a surprise to Seith, who rates him as one of the best ever.He said: “Alan was exceptional and a great header of the ball. His timing in the air was the thing and when he jumped he seemed to hang in the air. We knew that if we could get the ball to his head he would score goals.“At Dundee he had a fine partnership with Alan Cousin and he would have been the first to say Alan Cousin’s donkey work was responsible for him scoring as many goals as he did.“With Alan, though, it was not just about his heading, he had two very good feet as well. In fact, I was never sure whether he was left or right-footed.“He had the knack of being in the right place at the right time. He always seems to know where to be, that’s why he scored so many goals.”Former Dundee director and long-time friend, Dave Forbes, also paid tribute. Organiser of a number of events down the years to honour the 1961/62 team, he knew Gillie well.He said: “I knew he wasn’t well and I’m just glad it all seems to have been quite quick and he didn’t suffer for too long.”Particularly after spending 10 years in the limelight at Spurs, where he was dubbed the King of White Hart Lane, Gilzean was famous for valuing his privacy.For a long time after he retired, the native of Coupar Angus did not make many public appearances but, over the past decade or so, was a familiar figure at White Hart Lane on match days and made regular visits back to Dundee.“Gillie was a private man, but he was a gentleman.“I remember when we were organising Dundee’s centenary celebrations he was a big help,” added Forbes.“I am proud, honoured and privileged to have known him as a good friend.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b3f339a3829b-504x564.jpg ","title":"cammy kerr impressed by look of dundee squad as dark blues gear up for betfred cup","story":"\t\t\t\t\tFor the most part, the days of footballers spending the early period of pre-season with bellies overhanging their shorts as they battle to get back in shape are long gone.The rigours of the modern game mean, when on their holidays, players have fitness programmes to follow and keep themselves in shape.It means when they report back for work towards the end of June, they’re ready to go and the sight of one of them lagging behind in training is rare.Even so, Dundee defender Cammy Kerr has revealed he’s been surprised just how fit the squad at Dens Park is.That’s been apparent in two pre-season games so far as, despite the usual rustiness when it comes to things like touch, Neil McCann’s men have looked in top condition.As usual, Kerr’s been at the front of the runs in training and breezed through clashes with Brechin and Cowdenbeath.As well as being someone who enjoys a work out, the 22-year-old admits the memory of a disastrous Betfred Cup campaign two years ago has been a factor in the work put in.Back then, boss Paul Hartley took the gamble of using the early games in the competition as part of the pre-season build up. Dundee paid the price for that gamble by failing to get out of a group they had been expected to win comfortably and, ultimately, it was a factor in Hartley losing his job.Under McCann, the policy has been that the Betfred is an important event and it’s first game, not the league kick-off next month, marks the start of the season proper. That’s fine by his vice-captain.“I personally came back feeling really fit and I think as you’ve seen the rest of the boys look really fit as well,” he said.“You can kind of gauge first day back when we do a lot of testing. Everyone is a bit anxious because eyes are on you but this has been the fittest group of boys I’ve seen.“Everyone has a sharpness about them. I don’t know if it’s the modern game and the demands there are on you but everyone has been bang at it.“For me the Betfred two years ago gave me a shock. I remember speaking about it. That season we were straight into the competitive games and you are expected to win them but it doesn’t go that way because that’s football and you have to be ready.“That’s why to get the couple of games we’ve had has been massive and to get away (to Portugal), do some training and have another couple of games is massive as well.”Dundee are now in the Algarve where they’ll do more work and face SC Farense on Tuesday. Kerr’s sure that’ll have them ready for the Betfred tie at Stirling Albion Saturday week.“I enjoy being away. I’ve been to Hungary twice and Austria during pre-season and it’s good for the team.“You get to know the new boys who’ve come because you are together all the time and that’s important. We’re doing two sessions a day, eating meals together and spending time together at night as well.“That’s important because when you have new team-mates you can’t just go out on a pitch and gel right away. It takes work and time.”With the cup games looming large, Kerr feels the time away is also a chance to prepare properly.“We’re back in the middle of next week and then right into the first tie on the Saturday, so we can do a bit of work for that as well as the general stuff we’ve been doing.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"crossing for busy dundee road welcomed by locals","story":"\t\t\t\t\tResidents on a busy Dundee street have hailed the decision to install a pedestrian crossing.The project will involve closing Fountainbleau Drive, in the Linlathen area of the city, from Pitkerro Drive to Rowantree Crescent from July 23 for five days.Road safety measures will be put in place and the crossing will be installed.People living near the road backed the plan.Brian Cunningham, 48, a domestic worker, said: “The speed that some people go on the road is scary \u0026#8211 it is a long straight street and that is exactly what the boy racers want.“I think it’s a brilliant idea \u0026#8211 it’s been needed for a long time.”Jane Murray, 48, a support worker who has lived on the street for 24 years, said it was a “great idea”.She said: “The road is really busy. “Sometimes when I am trying to get across with my dog, I can be standing there for 10 minutes.“I definitely back the plan.

Before heading west, the young centre-half turned out for his parent club in the friendly draw at Brechin last Friday.And watching on was a scout from an English Premier League outfit who had headed north to specifically have a look at him.While that’s unlikely to lead to an immediate move to take him south, his first few appearances at Morton are likely to be monitored.Should Waddell impress, there’s still the possibility an offer for him could be forthcoming before the transfer window closes at the end of next month.It would take a substantial offer to persuade Dundee to part with him. Although he’s out of the first-team picture right now, he remains highly regarded at Dens.Meanwhile, it was Waddell’s performances in the two Betfred derbies around this time last year that persuaded then Dundee United boss Ray McKinnon, now in charge of the ’Ton, to take him there.While Waddell gets to know his temporary new team-mates, the Dundee squad have settled in at their training camp in the Algarve.They were having double training sessions there today, before Saturday’s bounce game against Mansfield.A second game will follow against SC Farense on Tuesday night, before boss Neil McCann brings the squad back to Scotland next Wednesday.The focus out in Portugal is on making sure the team are ready to go from the first whistle when the Betfred Cup kicks off with a group tie at Stirling Albion next week.For the second year running Neil is stressing the coming come ties are not being considered part of the pre-season build up.He insists the season proper starts with the Stirling game.“I always looked at it that way last year, I didn’t count the Betfred as a warm up to our season, the league season,” he said.“It’s a cup we want to go and do well in so in the pre-season games are vitally important we get the right conditioning into all the players.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee people baxter park picnic","story":"\t\t\t\t\tPlenty of people turned out for the Park Lives ‘Picnic in the Park’ event at Baxter Park in the sunshine on Thursday.The sun was shining was various activities which included a giant snakes and ladders board and face-painting.One woman getting in on the fun was Maryfield Community Officer – Constable Lydia Thatcher, pictured, who was spotted getting her face painted by some youngsters.The next Picnic in the Park event, Messy Play, event will take place on July 12 from midday to 2pm and is suitable for all ages.

saying the Canadian international wants to build on the feelgood factor that started up at Glebe Park.As a veteran of the Championship from his time at Dunfermline, however, he knows some tough times lie ahead.Very tough, in fact, because the 23-year-old reckons this year the second tier will be the most difficult in the land.He said: “It’s a tough league. The teams coming down will have an expectation to go straight back up.“Then there are teams that have been down there for a while that will have a real go at getting up.“I would probably goes as far as to be saying in Scotland right now it is the toughest league.“The Championship is the most competitive but we are a club that have ambitions and we are one I think should be in the Premiership. I think we can all agree on that.”That’s pretty much all he has to say on that last point. He knows the best place to show United’s intent won’t be in interviews but out on the pitch and by getting results.And as Csaba Laszlo’s new-look side gels, he’s confident that will be the case.“We need to do our talking on the pitch,” he added.“Hopefully, all the pieces will come together during the season and the goal is to get to the Premiership.“It is going to take time but the pre-season games and the Betfred Cup games before the league season starts are all preparation for the first game against Dunfermline.“And the Betfred Cup gives us competitive games before the season starts but at the end of the day it is part of our preparation for the start of the league.“It’s a lot better playing games than training all the time but we do want to go on a nice cup run as well.”The early signs up at Glebe Park were encouraging and Aird admits he was pleased with how things went for both himself and his new team-mates.“Obviously, I was delighted to get a run out and get the goal. It was my first game for Dundee United and it was great to get started.“It was a pre-season game and the big thing was to get minutes on the pitch and that was good.“And the goal was good for the confidence going forward.“It was the first time all the boys had played together and gave the manager the chance to have a look at us in a game rather than training.”While it goes without saying United have taken something of a gamble by making so many signings in one summer.There have already been nine new arrivals and the manager has revealed he’d like as many as another four before the Betfred Cup kicks off against Arbroath next week.Rather than being daunted by that, though, Aird is relishing the challenge of being part of what could be a completely new team.“It was a position when they signed nine new players that it was the rebuilding of a club.“The number of signings excited me. Obviously, the manager has a vision of the way he wants the team to play and the direction he wants to go.“It’s an exciting time ahead for the football club and I am glad to be part of it.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"hannah nets dream job at overgate gift shop after chance meeting on way to another interview","story":"\t\t\t\t\t“I absolutely love my job so was more than happy when I got asked to be store manager.”Hannah Murdoch, 24, began working at the Little Thistle Gift shop a week after it opened its doors in October 2015.After working in retail since she was at school, Hannah got the job after a chance encounter with the shop’s owner.She said: “I was actually on my way to another job interview when I noticed the shop had opened in the Overgate.“Little gift shops like this are my favourite kind of store so I always have to go in when I see one.“After chatting to one of the owners, Kevin, he told me to hand in a CV since I was looking for a job.“I got a call from him asking me to come in for an interview and they offered me a job there and then.“I absolutely love my job and after working here for a year, I was asked to become store manager, I was so shocked but more than happy to take on the role.”The Little Thistle Gift Shop’s secret is definitely it’s superb range of gifts – and Hannah says she loves being able to talk to customers about the products.“We have a lot of suppliers that we sell in store but it is very important to that the shop stocks local, independent products.“The owners Kevin and Tracey also make some of their own products which we sell. I love being able to tell the customer that the owners actually made the gift they are buying.”When it comes to working in retail Hannah says the most important thing is how you communicate with customers.She said: “The whole concept of the shop is to give customers that personal touch.“The most important part of that is how we interact with our customers.“The first thing you learn when you start work in the shop is everything else stops when a customer comes in and they become the most important thing.“We always say the staff in here love a chat but there is nothing better than a customer saying they have had a great experience in your store.“I really enjoying being able to serve someone well as that is what they will go and tell friends and family about and recommend the store to them.“You have to be approachable when working in retail and confident and comfortable speaking to people.“Confidence is something I have had to work on throughout my career, but it is something I would urge anyone interested in retail to work on too.”Although Hannah climbed up the retail ladder through working in several shops, there are many courses on offer in Dundee.Dundee and Angus College offer several in both retail and retail management.These include Introduction to Fashion Retailing where students get hands-on experience working within the college’s gift shop.HNC Retail sees students gaining a broad knowledge of the retail industry and the skills and qualities required for a diverse range of careers.The college also offers HND Retail Management where students have the opportunity to gain work experience managing and promoting the colleges pop-up shop, Tempus.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b434705bb1d3-846x564.jpg ","title":"locals vehemently against plans to withdraw concierge services from dundee multis","story":"\t\t\t\t\tCommunity groups are fighting back against plans to replace caretakers at Dundee’s multis.Hilltown and Lochee residents are calling on Dundee City Council to reconsider plans to centralise the caretakers with a “rapid response” team.Lochee’s Save Our High Street group, Phoenix Residents Group in Whorterbank and the Dundee Pensioners Forum are now set to take to the streets to petition fellow residents – claiming safety is being put at risk.Jayne Kelly, from Save Our High Street, said: “Everybody I have spoken to has been vehemently opposed to it.“For a lot of people, the caretakers are the first point of contact, so we want the council to reconsider this.“There’s a difference between consulting with us and allaying fears on a decision that’s already been made.”The new unit would be based out of Dundee West Housing Office in Lochee and would respond to incidents that are either called in or spotted on council CCTV. At present, caretakers work shifts as late as 3am, monitoring entrances, reporting incidents and assisting residents as required.Lochee councillor Charlie Malone previously shared his concerns about the removal of caretaker staff and wants the issue to be returned to the City Chambers.He said: “I have been contacted by community groups and many residents about fears they have in relation to the proposed centralisation of concierge services. No one has approached me in favour of the move and residents in Lochee and the Hilltown have begun campaigning.“A consultation is being planned which was meant to happen three years ago.“I will be looking to bring this back to the committee so that residents’ voices can be heard in the council chamber.”He added: “I visited an elderly resident in Adamson Court this week who told me without a concierge presence, she might never leave her house again due to safety concerns. Efficiencies can’t be delivered on the backs of the vulnerable.”A spokesman for Dundee City Council said: “Approval to consult with relevant stakeholders on the review of caretaker services was agreed by the council’s housing committee in June 2015.

There’s a lot of chopping and changing.“The main thing is all the new boys that have come in are looking good. Obviously, you miss the guys who were here before and have left but that’s just football, it’s a good change.“And I’ve really enjoyed my time here, bar the end of last season, so I’m delighted to still be here and part of things. Hopefully, I can have a good season.”While it’s still early days, Stanton believes there are signs United can make it third time lucky and win promotion this term.He’s been impressed by the quality of his new team-mates and with the way the side appears to be gelling.“At Brechin the other night we came together well and we moved the ball about pretty nicely considering it was the first game.“We are pretty fit and we’re feeling good. Everyone seems to be fitting in well and that was pleasing.“The manager’s brought in a lot of good players, so it’s exciting and we’re looking forward to the season starting.“It was a good start at Brechin and, hopefully, it will get better.”Today the Tangerines were in action in a closed-door friendly at their St Andrews training base and a week today sees the Betfred Cup kick off with a group tie against Arbroath at Tannadice.While the league is the priority, Stanton’s looking forward to that.“It’s only a few weeks until the league starts up and I’m really looking forward to it.“We’ve got the Betfred Cup starting next week and that’s good. Almost all the teams use it as part of their pre-season but we want to do well.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7486028.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film wins at the

closing,\" he said. \"It is good that it is staying in the city but it is that whole debate about out-of-town versus the city centre.\"It is quite clear that all High Streets and even shopping centres

There are consequences of the way we shop.\"I think the challenge is to maintain a city centre which is an attractive place to visit and socialise and purchase things.\"Mr Nicol said \"an awful lot of

store","story":"\u0026nbspTHOUSANDS of customers are being contacted following the sudden closure of an Inverness store specialising in mobility aids ranging from wheelchairs to stairlifts.Ableworld has cited an \"exploding\" glass panel and immigration hurdles for the American franchise owner as the reasons behind the closure of its Highland Mobility (Ableworld Inverness) branch in Harbour Road.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe Cheshire-based company, which is the UK\u0027 largest mobility retailer with more than 30 stores, is now making efforts to contact about 3000 customers, pledging no one will lose out on deposits or delivery of orders. It also aims to guarantee that all commitments to suppliers are fulfilled.The Inverness franchise has been held for about the last two years by American Jack Alldredge who is understood to be from Florida.The company\u0027 managing director Mike Williams said Mr Alldredge had hoped to settle in the UK after visiting the country.\"He loved the idea of living here and fell in love with Inverness,\" Mr Williams said.\"But he has had immigration issues. Sometimes we make it difficult for people to invest in this country. It is a shame.\"For the past 18 months, Mr Alldredge has tried to manage the store from America but the shattering of a glass panel in the building \u0026ndash understood to be leased \u0026ndash was the final straw at the beginning of June.\"Fortunately, no one was hurt,\" Mr Williams said.\u0026nbsp\"In our 18-year history, we have never closed a store apart from relocation so it is sad that after the roof \u0026lsquoexploded\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash which was a glass entrance, leaving a very dangerous situation with other panels \u0026ndash Jack decided to call it a day.\"\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspMr Williams said he was disappointed for Mr Alldredge as well as the store\u0027 three employees including a manager.As the store was operated as a franchise, Ableworld is not obliged to step in but it is aiming to honour commitments to suppliers and customers.\"Although saddened by the situation, Ableworld will ensure that all suppliers of stock to the company will not lose out and either Highland Mobility (Ableworld Inverness) will settle all accounts or Ableworld UK will satisfy all the suppliers,\" Mr Williams said.\"Also no customer will lose out on their present deposits or product delivery of orders.\"Ableworld will be setting up support networks for past customers of products and writing to customers explaining the situation.\"Too many businesses in our industry and others pull the plug and leave their customers and suppliers high and dry which is something we will not do.\"He also revealed the company was actively looking to open another franchise in the Inverness area.Inverness MP Drew Hendry said the store\u0027 closure would be a great loss to many disabled people. Citing the high-profile case of city guesthouse owners Russell and Ellen Felber who are fighting deportation to America, Mr Hendry said this was another example of how immigration policies were not working.\u0026nbsp\"I am already working with countless other local families facing a similar fate, including the Felbers whose ongoing battle to stay in Inverness is utterly heart-breaking,\" Mr Hendry said.Inverness disability rights campaigner David Sansum said there were few mobility aid suppliers in the city while the next nearest store was about 40 miles away in Forres.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\"I\u0026rsquom sure the closure of Ableworld will leave a big gap,\" he said. \"It is shame.\"\u0026nbspIn recent months, there have been a spate of incidents at Inverness retail parks where glass panels have fallen from overhead canopies.In March, Highland Council urged building owners with glazed canopies to check adequate inspection and maintenance arrangements were in place while Inverness South councillor Ken Gowans called for glass panels to be removed from canopies at all the city\u0027 retail parks.Tuesday 10 Jul 2018 1:35

But with the finishing touches applied to the new ground, Moorhouse says it’s “great” that their plans have finally come to fruition.He said: “It feels great and that is the overriding feeling – we feel proud of what we’ve managed to achieve.“We feel relieved because we’ve been so long without our own home and that’s not a nice feeling for anybody.“Contrary to popular belief, it costs an absolute fortune not to have your own ground.“I’ve heard so many things about how we’ve managed to save a fortune and invest it in the team and nothing could be further from the truth.“Playing every game away from home is a costly affair but we now have a place we can call home and we’re proud of it. It looks amazing.“Hopefully it allows us to fulfil our ambitions to play in the Scottish League and that’s not going to stop until we get there.“This year we’ll be equally determined and some of the changes to the squad will hopefully reflect the ambitions of the board, the club and the management team.“This is the platform for us to move on from where we are.“The Highland League is a great league to play in and we have a lot of friends in the Highland League, and they will remain friends. But we need to kick on because we’re an ambitious club.”Cove have encountered several problems over the last three years.Moorhouse added: “We’ve had a number of major obstacles. None of them we could see when we started on this journey.“When we closed Allan Park in April 2015 against Fort William, we didn’t think for one minute it would take three years to get in here.“We had initial issues around the sale of the first ground, to do with the bids that came in, and we lost nine months with that process. The next problem was access to the site. We lost a load of time with that and then we had issues with the weather.“But the design team and professional team that we brought on board to do the construction were first class and here we are now.“But we lost about a year and a half and because of that, it costs you extra money.”Now that the new ground has been built Moorhouse also hopes Cove can attract more fans from the area.He said: “You’ve got to feel sorry for our fans. They probably feel like they have been forgotten about and that’s never been the case on our part.“It’s been difficult to cater for them because we have been using other teams’ facilities and they’ve had to travel to every single game.“The guys who followed us through thick and thin I think have enjoyed themselves because the team have kicked on and played well. They’ve seen good football.“Playing in our area, the people who used to watch us at Allan Park will hopefully come back and, at the same time, we’ll want to create a new group of Cove fans because it’s three years since we last played in Cove.“The laddies who used to come and watch and run after the footballs when they were kicked outside the ground, they are grown men now.“Things have moved on in that period of time and we need to capture a new group of Cove fans.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"win three pairs of tickets to see the lady boys of bangkok in aberdeen","story":"\t\t\t\t\tWe have three pairs of tickets up for grabs for one of the Lady Boys of Bangkok\u0026#8217s Aberdeen shows.Prepare for a night you’ll talk about for years as they flirt, tease and tempt!No one will leave the show without a smile on their face and a song in their heart.To be in with a chance of winning of three pairs of tickets, simply fill in our form below.The show is in Aberdeen between Friday July 13 and Saturday July 28th.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"boozing teenagers snared by undercover cops in aberdeen","story":"\t\t\t\t\tBoozing teens have been snared by undercover cops during a special operation.Rowdy youths have caused such problems for Dyce and Bridge of Don residents that officers have been deployed in plain-clothes during the last three weeks.So far they have nabbed 19 offenders in connection with incidents involving alcohol, drinking and antisocial behaviour — and police have held school assemblies to warn of the dangers of drug taking.Sergeant Lisa Kerr said: “Behaviour which affects people’s quality of life will not be tolerated.”The problem came to a head when a woman living in Bridge of Don complained to councillors about a group of up to 20 youths gathering near her home.

Now scientists from the University of Aberdeen have added a third species to the mix \u0026#8211 the European pine marten. These native squirrel predators are recolonising Britain after years of persecution, and so the scientists set out to uncover the impact of this on red and grey squirrel populations.Three study sites in Scotland were in the Highlands (marten recolonisation for over 45 years, no grey squirrels), Central Scotland (marten recolonisation for 8-14 years, grey squirrels since 1945) and the Borders (early stages of marten recolonization, grey squirrels since 1980).Populations were monitored for five months using cameras and multi-species feeders \u0026#8211 the latter with glue strips on the underside of the lid to obtain visitor hair samples. This material provided DNA to determine visitor species and identify individual martens.The results showed that while red squirrels avoided feeders used by martens, greys were equally likely to use feeders whether frequented by martens or not. So grey squirrel numbers were reduced where exposure to pine martens was high, whereas numbers of red squirrels increased – unequivocal evidence that recovering marten numbers affect competition between red and grey squirrels.This finding is likely explained by the fact that reds, having co-evolved with martens, instinctively avoid areas used by martens but invasive greys, having no such instincts, showed no avoidance behaviour at all.Since pine martens’ range is increasing and extending southwards, scientists are optimistic that this will control the invasive grey squirrel species.As they say in the title to their report, in this case ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend’.PIC:The native grey squirrel may have an unlikely ally.

We simply don\u0026#8217t have enough children playing shinty in each school to make up separate clubs.Surely, in 2018, this shouldn\u0026#8217t be allowed to happen?It is only three clubs that are being affected by this, and they\u0026#8217re all in the south of Scotland,  half way through a season, leaving all our kids devastated at the though of losing their chosen sport.My son has been playing shinty since Primary One. He is now heading into Primary Four and is even more passionate about the sport. He enjoys quality team time, striving to be the best he can and just loving playing the game.It\u0026#8217s very difficult to explain something like this to an eight-year-old child, never mind the Primary One children we have in our club.One quote from a child was: \u0026#8216Everyone is going to be so sad if we don\u0026#8217t have shinty. Why would shinty people do this to us?\u0026#8217It\u0026#8217s a very sad day indeed for the children of Argyll and Bute who are simply being punished for what school they go to and where they live. We have to stand together and fight for our club and our children.The Camanachd Association needs to step up and find a solution to allow all children to compete nationally and stand as one united shinty community.Ailsa and Alastair Crawford, LochgilpheadSir,The Camanachd Association has put politics before the needs of the children and the development of the sport in Argyll.The kids are disappointed and the coaches who have worked tirelessly to set the club up are deflated. Surely the association knows this is a mistake that needs rectified immediately.Personally, Kilmory and Dunadd children\u0026#8217s club has inspired our son and daughter to get involved with the sport and to grow in confidence amongst other like-minded children.Stuart and Simone Charnock, LochgilpheadSir,My son has trained with Kilmory/Dunadd shinty club since he was in Primary One. The club has always treated the kids equally and welcomed all kids to participate.After years of hard work, the team was progressing well and was worthy of competing at national level.In his last year before high school, to be told he is no longer allowed to play is not only devastating to my son but greatly confusing and he is left wondering what he has done wrong.I fail to see how this can be classed as progress by the Camanachd Association. This needs to be readdressed to allow kids to compete in the game they love.Susan Jackson, LochgilpheadI was very angry to hear from local residents in Portnahaven that their recycling bins have been used by numerous motorhomes for disposing of general waste, including food waste.I have visited the recycling bins site in Portnahaven and spoken to my constituents in person about this and I can confirm that unfortunately Portnahaven\u0026#8217s recycling bins are full of general waste.This is as unacceptable as it is disrespectful. I have contacted the appropriate department with the council and asked for an investigation to be done. I also asked for some addition signage for the bins area.I made it very clear that my constituents should not lose their recycling facilities as a result of their bins being misused by someone else.I will continue to monitor this situation and provide an update as soon as I have more information.Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,It is fitting to mark this Diabetes Week (June 11-17) for Scotland’s 30,000 adults and children living with type one diabetes by noting that life-changing monitors are now available on the NHS.A child diagnosed with type one diabetes at five faces 50,000 finger prick blood glucose tests by the time they are 18.Each painful finger prick is part of a daily routine which also includes calculating carbohydrate intake and frequent insulin injections, all to prevent life-threatening hypoglycaemia and long term complications.But since November last year, a \u0026#8216flash glucose monitoring\u0026#8217 system called the Freestyle Libre can be prescribed by local GPs, offering an alternative to such intensive finger-pricking.The roll out of flash glucose monitoring, which gives a reading via a simple sensor, however, is not consistent across all local health boards. So, our message for Diabetes Week is to call for health boards in Scotland to speed up prescription policies and step up much needed prescriptions.As someone who has lived with type one diabetes for 21 years, new technology, such as the FreeStyle Libre, makes a world of difference.Type one diabetes cannot be prevented and until we find the cure for it, research and technology are vital.Holly Davies, development manager, Aberdeen\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"exciting shinty at the macaulay sixes","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 22/06/18, 8:15 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowNo fewer than 29 youth shinty teams travelled to Oban\u0026#8217s Mossfield Park for the annual Macaulay six-a-side competition.The winners of the main competition for P7 and under were Inverlochy, who defeated Taynuilt 1-0 in the final with Taynuilt taking the Oban Celtic Shield.The Alastair Campbell Shield for P5 and under was won by Braxi Boys from Inverlochy who defeated Bute in a very exciting final after extra time by one penalty to nil.The Macaulay Development trophy was won by Rockfield Rapids.

This could threaten future trade deals, environmental standards and food safety.The Tories think they can do whatever they want to Scotland and get away with it.The SNP tabled amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill to safeguard the Scottish Parliament from the threat of constraints on existing powers.This is something which Holyrood refused consent for last month by an overwhelming majority including all parties, except the Scottish Conservatives.It would simply be a democratic outrage and it would fly in the face of the fundamental principles of devolution. This Conservative government seems determined to destroy the founding principles of devolution and Labour and the Lib Dems must join us in defending it.Brendan O’Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.Sir,It seems that almost every day I\u0026#8217m contacted by farmers in my constituency with concerns about their future.This is hardly surprising as farmers are borrowing more and having to pay staff less, according to figures released by the Scottish Government.According to ‘Agricultural Facts and Figures’ published recently, agricultural borrowing has doubled in the last 10 years, capital investment has stayed the same and agricultural workers are earning £1,560 less on average compared to last year.The figures show farm borrowing has almost doubled from £1.38 billion to £2.28 billion between 2007 to 2017, while capital investment has stayed the same at £210 million.This demonstrates that farmers are investing much less in their machinery and equipment while still having to borrow ever-increasing sums to remain viable.This is on top of the fact farmers are still struggling with debts they incurred as a result the CAP payment fiasco caused by the SNP Government several years ago.Time and time again the separatists have shown complete disregard to the plight that our hard pressed farmers are facing. It seems our agricultural industry is just one more sector that is ignored by the separatists in their relentless push for a second independence referendum.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Claims by Theresa May that a so-called ‘Brexit dividend’ will help pay for a boost to NHS spending in England worth £20 billion a year within five years are highly disingenuous.The UK will continue to pay into the EU through the transition until the end of 2020 and will pay £20 billion of the \u0026#8216divorce bill\u0026#8217 through to 2028. In addition, the UK Government has committed to keep EU funding for agricultural subsidies, research and development and other key areas at the same level in the short-term.These are set figures so it will be at least 10 years before any so-called ‘Brexit dividend’, if it were ever to materialise, is to be realised. Add to that, if the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts are accurate, public finances are set to be £15 billion a year worse off by 2021, equivalent to £300 million a week.Interestingly, if taxes are set to rise, which they will clearly have to, it is staggering hypocrisy for the Tories to have attacked the Scottish Government’s boosting of the NHS in Scotland through progressive tax changes and then look to hike taxes themselves.Alex Orr, Edinburgh.Sir,Local government spending cuts have left councils in Scotland unable to meet the needs of local communities and, in some cases, are putting the public at risk.A survey of more than 2,000 local government employees working across all services reveals almost eight in 10 council workers have no confidence in the future of local services and half are thinking of leaving their jobs for less stressful work elsewhere.While local authorities have protected spending on statutory service areas such as adult and children’s social care, the amount they spend on other areas including parks and libraries has fallen sharply.Local authorities have had to cut so many vital services that they have now reached a point where vulnerable children and the elderly struggle to get the help that they need, entire communities are suffering and the public is being put at risk.There have been cuts to road and bridge maintenance, potholes in roads are left unfilled and bridges are at risk of crumbling. Crematoriums are not maintained, streetlights stay broken and parks are in disrepair as councils don’t have the equipment or the staff to adequately maintain them.There are now more than one million people with an unmet need for social care because councils do not have the resources to support them. Now is the time to reverse these cuts and invest in local government once more or the fabric of our society will come unstuck.Mark Ferguson, chairman, UNISON Scotland local government committee.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 24/06/18, 3:39 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.There is no denying Lochgilphead could benefit from a wash and brush up.

However, the away team were really up against it from the start. The Ardnamurchan ladies were clearly also up for the game and had a full squad to choose from. With some key players out and one new player making her debut, the nine player squad from Dunadd started strongly. They had several early chances but just couldn\u0026#8217t find the back of the net.There were some crunching tackles and tasty challenges in the first half the Ardnamurchan ladies were keen to neutralise the strength of Dunadd defender Iona McCulloch, often doubling up on her. Referee Beth MacDonald had her work cut out trying to contain tempers as tensions ran high both on and off the pitch.The first half ended 0-0 and Dunadd left the field feeling like they hadn\u0026#8217t performed to their usual high standards. After a rousing half time team talk, Dunadd were keen to get an early goal in the second half to help settle them and to perhaps go on and build from there.And that is exactly what they did. Straight from the throw up, Grace Drummond caught the ball cleanly, sending it sailing over the defence\u0026#8217s heads. Leone Airlie ran on to it and struck it smoothly, low beyond the keeper.However, the home team responded positively and had Dunadd pinned back in their own half for the next five minutes. On 40 minutes, a fortunate strike from wide left bounced past a few players and found it\u0026#8217s way into the corner of the Dunadd net, 1-1.Dunadd were not despondent and regrouped to press again. However, minutes later Ardnamurchan broke and finished well making it 2-1.Again the referee had to step in to break up some fierce challenges as Ardnamurchan continued to goad McCulloch. However, the young Dunadd defender answered the contentious tackles in the best possible way. In the 51st minute she collected a loose ball and broke away from her marker. After dodging past three players she shot high and scored a certain goal of the season contender, pinging it sweetly into the top corner.The remainder of the game saw both teams coming close to winners. Ellie Hetherington making some crucial blocks and tackles, clearing the ball to safety time and time again. Dunadd held on to grind out the result and retain their unbeaten record and hold on to top spot in south division two.After a summer break, Dunadd will travel to third placed GMA on Sunday August 5 in another crucial game as they search to get back to winning ways.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"scrum for burgers","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 30/06/18, 7:47 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe Mid Argyll Rugby Club had its annual end-of-season barbeque and awards ceremony at the Ropework park on Sunday June 24.The kids from P4/5 and P6/7 that played a big part in winning the league and runners up in P4/5 also received medals.Of the primary six and sevens, player of the year went to Murray MacDonald, most improved player of the year went to Aileen Barr, the coaches award went to Campbell Shaw and best newcomer went to Rhys Coffield.Of the younger kids of primary four and five, the player of the year award went to Arran Martin most improved player of the year went to Fergus Bennet the coaches award went to Jorja and Jemma MacDonald and best newcomer went to Logan Cinnamond.On top of their awards, all the kids were also given a new training top sponsored by Jewsons.The players also clubbed together to get all the coaches a gift each.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"inverarays sale of the summer gets underway","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 02/07/18, 6:37 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe famous Inveraray summer sale has started.On Monday June 25, Inveraray’s parish church hall opened its doors, brimming with exquisite odds and ends.Ornaments, sports equipment and anything else you can think of can be found at the church for a fair price.Volunteer Wilma Wood said: \u0026#8216Anyone looking for something in particular can give us a shout.

The pair were steady, neat and quick all day and broke the timing beam on stage eight, Bishop\u0026#8217s Glen, to complete the rally in 23rd overall and third in class four.Everything finally came together and the car and crew got the result they deserve.

I am still receiving many justifiable complaints about the terrible condition of Mansefield Road in Port Ellen and the hospital road in Bowmore. With long overdue road works going on across Islay and the rest of the Kintyre and Islands ward, it\u0026#8217s only fair these roads are not ignored.The poor condition of the Bruichladdich toilets continues to be raised by local residents.Since contacting the appropriate department I have been informed repairs and maintenance are planned for them.While checking on the progress of pothole repairs I had previously requested, I noticed some of the recent street light repairs leave a lot to be desired. While a quick fix is better than nothing, many of these short-term fixes need to be looked at again.I have been speaking to the BT Openreach staff across Islay who are expanding our island\u0026#8217s internet capabilities. I have contacted BT to make sure recent issues with phone lines in some local households are not a result of the broadband upgrades.There has been progress with local housing associations after pointing out many of their tenants are having trouble with mould in their housing. Measures are now being implemented to to rectify the problem. I was happy to hear Argyll Community Housing Association has fixed gate latches on four of its houses at Cnoc Na Faire in Port Ellen after I raised this with them a few weeks ago.I met with environment, development and infrastructure committee member councillor Gary Mulvaney about Kintyre and Islands\u0026#8217 crumbling infrastructure, alongside our growing industrial output with the success of distilleries on Islay and Jura.Later that day I spoke directly to my constituents in Tarbert after a number of locals \u0026#8211 some business owners \u0026#8211 contacted me about the recent flood of sewage on Harbour Street as a result of blocked drains. Scottish Water were coming under fire from locals because of its slow progress on the matter.I made my anger about the poor conditions in Tarbert very clear when I contacted Scottish Water. A long-term solution to needs to be put in place.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Scottish Water is asking customers to use water wisely in their daily activities to help maintain supplies during the current hot summer weather.Following a sustained dry period without any significant rainfall, customer use has increased significantly.In some areas, there has been a 30 per cent increase in demand for water and an additional 140 million litres are currently being produced and pushed through the system every day.The situation is being monitored closely to manage supplies across the country.This includes deploying additional resources to move water between distribution areas and tankering water to supplement local networks.Average reservoir levels are generally normal for this time of year but the current level of use and continuing dry weather means stocks of stored water available for use are reducing.Try to reduce use wherever possible.Businesses are also being asked to consider their use and how they can use water more efficiently.Simple, practical steps include: taking shorter showers, using a watering can rather than a hose to water plants, using a bucket rather than a hose to wash vehicles only washing windscreens/lights instead of the whole vehicle, turning off taps whenever possible and use washing machines and dishwashers fully loaded.More advice on using water wisely is online at www.scottishwater/savewaterscotland or call 0800 0778778.Peter Farrer, Chief Operating Officer, Scottish Water.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"riverside fun day sparkles in the sun","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 06/07/18, 9:44 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe sun shone on the Riverside in Lochgilphead for a day of fun.Mid Argyll Community Pool and Riverside Rascals nursery hosted the family day on Sunday July 1, featuring a variety of colourful craft and charity stalls.The unmistakeable aroma of barbecue wafted across the car park from Riverside Rascals nursery, which opened its doors to the public for the occasion, complete with children\u0026#8217s activities.MACPool lifeguards were on hand to keep an eye on the youngsters in the pedal boats while the sunshine glistened across the splashing fun.PICS:Four-year-old Kaiden Abel from Lochgilphead has fun splashing in the inflatable outdoor pool. 06_a27RiversideFun01Kyra Robertson, aged 11, from Cairnbaan, tries to hook a duck on the MS centre stand \u0026#8211 and it\u0026#8217s not as easy as it looks. 06_a27RiversideFun04On the MS Centre Mid Argyll stall were Maggie Dodd and centre manager Karen McCurry. 06_a27RiversideFun07Mary Stewart of the Loch Awe Pottery helps sisters Abby and Chloe McCallum, from Glasgow, to decorate their pottery. 06_a27RiversideFun08Cathleen MacDonald was there with her Woolly Bobbins textile-base crafts. 06_a27RiversideFun09Alongside Cathleen was her mum Margaret Davidson, who creates soft toys under the name Twisted Yarn.

Isabelle Cairns, of Ayr, has hit out at the amount of rubbish being left on the beach. And the Financial Adviser feels that the council could do more. Isabelle said: “There are two beaches here, one part gets cleaned and one doesn’t. “Between Doonfoot side and the Pavillion is generally clean. “But the rest is neglected. “There was a petition signed about this and the fact the council have stopped cleaning parts of the beach. “There are plastic bottles all over the place, I even saw dirty nappies lying. “I get that it costs a lot of money to get staff out, but there are other options for the council.  “They could get community workers in, the ones who are serving community payback orders.” Isabelle claims that Ayr has little to offer outside the beach these days. She said: “What’s in Ayr now? It’s a ghost town. “There is not a lot about, but the beach is an attraction that brings in people from all over the country. “Walking along the beach seeing this mess was nothing short of disgusting. “It gets to me as it’s such a beautiful beach. “What you also have to think about is that all kinds of rubbish is going to be washed out to sea when the tide comes in.  “It’s just going to get even worse going forward as the schools are now off. “More people will be going to the beach and it’s just going to become an absolute travesty. “People have no respect for the beach, but the council should have someone cleaning up when it’s like that.” A council spokesman said: “We monitor our beaches closely and work within the national guidance and with available resources to keep our beaches looking their best, so they can be enjoyed by local people and visitors alike. “We clean and litter-pick the full stretch of Ayr Beach and ask people to dispose of their waste in our bins rather than abandoning rubbish on the sand. “The section from Cromwell Road to the Pier is not routinely mechanically cleaned as it’s classed as an amenity beach rather than a recreational beach, but the stretch is still managed on a regular basis.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12863891.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/8898834.jpg","title":"full time ayr united can","story":"NewsFull-time Ayr United can make their Mark in Ladbrokes ChampionshipThe Honest Men were relegated at the first time of asking in the second tier in the 2016/17 season when they finished bottom with 33 points.\u0026nbspShareByLochlin Highet12:31, 6 JUL 2018NewsMark Roberts (Image: SNS Group)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMark Roberts insists that being full-time could make all the difference for Ayr United this time round in the Championship. The Honest Men were relegated at the first time of asking in the second tier in the 2016/17 season when they finished bottom with 33 points. But former Ayr hitman and manager, Roberts, reckons being part-time was what held them back. Marko, who played second tier football with Ayr under Brian Reid, said: “I think Ayr will be fine, I really do. “Being full-time in that league is a massive thing. “The last few times Ayr have been in that league it has been very difficult to compete with the full-time teams. “But the fact they have got that now will make a big difference and I don’t think they will have any issues staying in the league. “When I was there under Brian Reid, being part-time was what held us back. “You didn’t have enough time to go and work on things on a daily basis but Ayr will have that now.  “You can beat any team in a one-off game but over the course of a season of 36 games it’s difficult to compete. “But the fans should be excited this time as there should be no problem – Ayr can even start looking up rather than looking down.” Roberts, who hit the net 43 times for Ayr, was more than impressed with Ayr’s impressive goal-scoring form last season as they topped League One, pipping Raith on the final game of the season. He said: “I thought they were really good to watch. “You always thought they were going to score every game they played. “And I don’t mean just scoring one, you always thought they’d grab three or four. “Sometimes they were left open all over the park – but they had too much quality up front and that’s the reason they went up. “Fair play to them as they had three really good strikers in Shankland, Moore and Moffat.” Roberts added: “The way the league was won was certainly a bit of a way to win it.  “I’ve been in teams that have won titles and been promoted with five or six games to go, which gives you a great feeling of accomplishment, but there’s nothing more exciting than winning the title in the last 10 minutes of the season. “Both teams had the chance to run away with it but kept faltering.” Roberts managed Ayr for three years before getting sacked, He then had a player/coach role at Clyde for a season. He has now gone back to playing at Junior Cup finalists Hurlford United. But he insists that his managing days aren’t over.  He said: “I won’t give up on it, I just wanted to play again for now. The best days of your life are when you’re kicking a ball and I am still fit enough.  “Any manager who tells you they prefer coaching is talking rubbish. When you’re out there playing it’s  just great.  “I do want to get back to managing eventually though, but it’s all about finding the right club and what suits my life at the minute.” "},{"url":null,"title":"lane closure inspection station hotel","story":"NewsLane closure as inspection at Station HotelGable end of the building to be investigated\u0026nbspShareByGary Fanning17:58, 6 JUL 2018Updated18:03, 6 JUL 2018NewsFront entrance to Ayr railway station is blocked off (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailOne lane of the A70 will be shut off to allow for an inspecton of the gable wall of the Station Hotel just off Burns Statute Square.

Network Rail and Scotrail have been informed of the partial road closure and we are working with them to ensure passengers can get to and from the various platforms as easily and as safely as possible. Donald Gillies, Director – Place at South Ayrshire Council said: “We’re linking with our partners to limit disruption to the public however these inspections and subsequent works are necessary at this time. As we get a clearer picture of the condition of the building further restrictions may be necessary to keep rail users and the wider public safe. “We will continue to track the work carried out on the privately owned building with a view to recovering the costs of these works from the owners.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrScotrailSouth Ayrshire CouncilTransport"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12884680.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/asr_ayp_210618Nicola3jpeg.jpg","title":"meet weeks wedding week","story":"NewsMeet this week\u0027s Wedding of the WeekNicola, 28-year-old classical singer married 30-year-old shipbuilding engineer John Hunter.\u0026nbspShareByAbi Smillie16:46, 9 JUL 2018NewsJohn and Nicola share a moment (Image: Kevin Moulds Photography)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThis week’s Wedding of the Week bride is Ayrshire’s own Award Winning Classical Artist Nicola Cassells. Nicola, 28-year-old classical singer married 30-year-old shipbuilding engineer John Hunter. The pair now live in Shawlands, Glasgow, but were both originally from Ayr. One Friday night back in 2009 John walked in to Harley’s Pub in Ayr to wish his cousin a happy birthday, and his sister told him to say hello to Nicola – her workmate at the time. “Nobody knows if it was the brown eyes, the sweet perfume or the six pints, three vodkas and the shot of Midori that caused him to steal my cardigan but steal it he did,” joked Nicola. She added: “A few days later, cardigan in hand, John returned it to H Samuel where I worked at the time. And that moment was the beginning of something special.” Since then both have enjoyed years of happiness and in October 2016 – seven years after meeting – John asked Nicola to marry him at Loch Lomond.  John and Nicola tied the knot on Thursday, June 7, at The Cruin at Loch Lomond. The couple said: “It was relaxing, elegant and absolutely perfect. “We can’t thank the staff enough. The weather, setting and scenery were breath-taking.” The bride wore a Vera Wang dress from David’s Bridal, Braehead, the bridesmaids also wearing gowns from David’s Bridal. The kilts were the Spirit of Lochearn tartan from Kilts 4 U. The wedding party consisted of Best man Mark Cosgrove, Groomsmen Niall Carney, Paddy McCurdie and Ryan Glass (nephew, aged 8), Maid of honour sister Jennifer Cassells, Bridesmaids Laura Dickson, Heather Armstrong and Aimee Trainer, Groom’s parents John Hunter and Hazel Hunter and the Bride’s parents Brian Cassells and Julie Cassells. The pair are currently celebrating being newlyweds in Bangkok, Thailand, and will be heading to Koh Samui, Thailand, then on to the Atlantis in Dubai.  3D Cakes created the couples wedding cake. The couple said: “We were inspired by the Scottish theme and used the same tartan ribbon that was on the kilts.” Kev Moulds Photography captured Nicola and John’s big day, leaving them with fond memories to look back on. The bouquets were arranged by Narcissus Flowers by Susan Hair and make-up was styled and created by Anna Wade (hair) and Lynn Brown (make-up). The couple added: “We would like to thank everyone who made the day possible, especially our parents Brian Cassells, Julie Cassells, John Hunter and Hazel Hunter. “And to our guests who contributed to an amazing day.” For more photos of the couple\u0027s big day, pick up your copy of this week\u0027s Ayrshire Post.

What about prelims, exams, studying, grades?\nBut what do all these pressures bring to the fragile mind of a young person, and how do they process the stress to ensure their mental wellbeing?\nIn steps Suzi Gibson, who has been running mindful meditation sessions with Peebles High pupils as part of Health Week for the past five years.\nAnd so a group of pupils dropped their pencils, calculators and chemistry tools and walked through the doors of a more unique classroom setting, kicking off their school shoes and leaving their cares behind them as the lay in the comfort of Space 108 in Peebles.\nCan mindfulness meditation really help pupils concentrate amid the distractions of 21st century living?\nI decided to experience for myself the sessions offered freely to the pupils by Suzi, who guided sessions at the high school before opening her studio at Greenside, Peebles, in January 2016.\nAdmittedly I had always been a bit sceptical about meditation. I mean seriously, how can sitting on a floor in the lotus position, inhaling the pleasant oil aroma while the ambient sounds of dolphins singing and ocean waves crash, bring me peace of mind?\nI\u0026rsquom a wife, mother, writer, and like most people, my life is busy and my head is bursting with thoughts from which there\u0026rsquos no escape.\nBut I entered the beautiful airy studio with an open-mind and intrigued about the experiences of the pupils.\nOn this particular afternoon, I feel like I\u0026rsquove got the weight of the world on my shoulders. Thoughts are racing through my head like a train out of control. But immediately I feel a sense of calmness speaking to Suzi, as she explains the techniques she is using and gently guides me through the smooth ride to a quiet mind\u0026hellipand I am, going, going, gone\u0026hellip\nI am in a state of deep peace and the mind is calm, so much so, when I hear Suzi\u0026rsquos soft instruction to open my eyes \u0026ndash I don\u0026rsquot want to. I love it here.\nSo now I can see why meditation could potentially tackle a myriad of problems suffered by young students, including mental health. This is a growing problem in the Scottish Borders, with evidence suggesting almost 2,000 children and young people in the region will experience mental ill health at some point in their lives.\nThe sessions are offered to groups of pupils from S1 to S3, who arrive at the studio giggling with excitement and anticipation for their new experience.\nSuzi explained: \"There are some nerves and awareness of peers, especially if there is a mix of ages. The great thing is, once they close their eyes, it becomes completely about their own experience. Fidgeting and chatting stops, there is a sense of calm, and some sleep which is great because they perhaps need it.\"\nEach group is given an insight into the benefits of meditation, as well as exploring how stress becomes unhealthy, warning signs, and how to build resilience through practical techniques that can help reduce anxiety.\nThe meditation guru shared skills with the pupils which, if put into practice daily, can be life-changing.\nSuzi said: \"They are all very relaxed and quite amazed at the experience. I hope they leave with the knowledge that they have the ability to create calmness within themselves using some of the techniques they have learned, leading to greater concentration, focus, creativity and well rested teens.\"\nThe visible difference in the pupils during the session at Space 108 has astounded school staff. \"Some of the teachers and staff who have attended over the years can\u0026rsquot quite believe the quiet and calm that begins to settle in the room. I\u0026rsquove had a few parents afterwards tell me how much their kids enjoyed it,\" said Suzi.\n\"There is a lot of anxiety and tension in our kids today, sometimes a feeling of being relaxed is a little alien to them, then they experience it. That\u0026rsquos the important bit, they have an experience of relaxation and calm, not an intellectual understanding that it is good for them, but an actual experience.\"\nResearch has proven that mindfulness and meditation is very beneficial to a person\u0026rsquos mental health, and many schools are incorporating it into their classrooms, teaching philosophies, and disciplinary programs.\nIn fact, some schools are choosing to replace detention with meditation with it even being used as behavioural therapy in classrooms.\nWhether this trend will catch on remains to be seen, as there are many parents who still prefer traditional discipline, with youngsters being given their marching orders to the principal\u0026rsquos office for unruly behaviour.\nBut one thing is certain, the pupils of Peebles High School reaped the benefits of their mindful meditation sessions with Suzi during Health Week last month.\nPrincipal teacher of pastoral care Kirsteen Robertson, said: \"The studio is beautiful, the students immediately notice how soothing the space is, the lovely smell and lighting. The sessions give our students strategies to relax, think calmly, reducing stress and anxiety and improve sleep. It\u0026rsquos just amazing to see how some of them react.\"\nHaving embraced meditation and its healing benefits, I leave the studio feeling renewed, carefree and a little lighter on my feet. The everyday worries and thoughts I described like a train racing out of control? They\u0026rsquod disembarked at station 108, where Peeblesshire\u0026rsquos very own princess of peace resides.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"eildon-achieve-excellence-in-quality-management","story":"MANAGEMENT at Eildon Housing have been recognised for achieving excellence.\nStaff from the Selkirk-based provider were awarded four stars by the European Foundation for Quality Management.\nAnd they have managed to reach pass marks in all nine Excellence Model criteria set by the Foundation within three years.\nEildon\u0026rsquos chief executive Nile Istephan is delighted with the award.\nHe told us: \u0026ldquoThis is another fantastic recognition for the work of the Eildon Group and all of our staff who work hard to deliver ever improving services to our customers.\n\"To have achieved such a speedy progression through this demanding framework in only three years is a great achievement and we are very proud of our colleagues for their efforts.\n\"This award demonstrates our continuing focus on business improvement, building on the organisation\u0026rsquos strengths to attain even higher levels of excellence throughout our entire operation and we are absolutely delighted to receive four-star recognition.\"\nEildon are currently beginning a record-breaking expansion programme of house-building across the Borders.\nThe Quality Management award was made at the recent Scottish Business Awards.\nClaire Ford, chief executive officer of Quality Scotland added: \"Eildon Housing Association\u0026rsquos achievement of Recognised for Excellence Four Star, in their first assessment, is a clear demonstration of an organisation\u0026rsquos drive and desire to achieve sustainable business excellence and truly embed a culture of continuous improvement.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"scary-start-to-sun-kissed-earlston-civic-week","story":"DON\u0027T expect too many crows to drop in on this year\u0027s Earlston Civic Week.\nTo herald the start of this week\u0027s fun-packed festival scarecrows have been placed all entrances to the town as well as a few locations around the centre.\nAnd they will stay there until the Civic Week conclusion this weekend.\nVillagers have already enjoyed a day of pub games at the Red Lion as well as a ramble, car treasure hunt and a football tournament during the weekend.\nAnd on Monday the ever-popular pet show took place at the Cauldie beneath beautiful blue skies, along with a duck race and barbecue.\nLast (Tuesday) night athletes of all ages and abilities tackled the Black Hill in roasting hot temperatures.\nAnd throughout this afternoon a children\u0027s party will be held in the grand marquee, followed in the evening by the hotly contested quiz.\nEarlston\u0027s annual celebrations conclude this weekend with a Senior Citizens\u0027 bash in the marquee on Friday, followed by Scocha in concert and a late-night disco.\nAnd tomorrow the fabulous fancy dress parade takes place on Saturday afternoon ahead of the sports, torchlight parade and fireworks.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"scottish-water-urge-borderers-to-use-less-water-during-heatwave","story":"SCOTTISH Water is urging Borderers to use water wisely to help maintain supplies while the country basks in a prolonged heatwave.\nFollowing a sustained dry period without any significant rainfall, customer usage for water has increased significantly.\nWith the current warm weather conditions forecast to continue, Scottish Water bosses are encouraging people to take simple but important steps to conserve public water supplies.\nIn some areas there has been a 30 percent increase in demand for water during the summer so far and an additional 140 million litres are currently being produced and pushed through the system every day to meet current customer usage.\nScottish Water has been monitoring the situation closely and are managing supplies across the country, including deploying additional resources to move water between distribution areas and tankering water to supplement local networks.\nSome water treatment works and distribution networks are also working at near capacity to meet demand.\nAverage reservoir levels are generally normal for this time of year, but the current level of usage and continuing dry weather means stocks of stored water available for use are reducing.\nThe main advice for Borderers is to reduce water usage wherever possible. Businesses are also urged to consider their usage and how they can use water more efficiently.\nScottish Water are encouraging residents to do the following: taking shorter showers, using a watering can rather than a hose to water plants, using a bucket rather than a hose to wash vehicles only washing windscreens/lights instead of the whole vehicle, turning off taps in the home whenever possible, and using washing machines and dishwashers fully loaded.\nPeter Farrer, Scottish Water\u0026rsquos chief operating officer, said: \u0026ldquoWater usage levels during the current hot summer weather, particularly during peak times such as morning and early evening, mean we are working around the clock to get water around the system quickly enough.\n\u0026ldquoScotland\u0026rsquos public water supply is the lifeblood of the country, for household and business customers.

summer campaign","story":"The school summer holidays are here and it’s easy for health routines to go out of the window as children relax, enjoy the outdoors and get stuck into their favourite hobbies.Asthma UK is launching a campaign urging parents of children with asthma to make sure they take their usual preventer medicine and keep up a routine over the school break.The medicine builds up over time so will help to protect their child from an asthma attack during the summer holiday and once they return to school.Every 10 seconds someone has a potentially life-threatening asthma attack in the UK and three people die from an asthma attack every day.In September, children are nearly three times more likely to be admitted to hospital because of an asthma attack than in August, partly due to seasonal triggers such as cold and flu viruses.If a child hasn’t kept up their preventer medicine routine over the school holidays, they will be at greater risk of reacting to these triggers.The good news is that by taking a few simple steps, parents can help their child to avoid asthma attacks and enjoy the summer as much as anyone else:Keep up your child’s usual preventer medicine routine, usually a brown inhaler.Make sure your child has an up-to-date written asthma action plan, which you can download from Asthma UK’s website, and share this with anyone who will be looking after them as using one means they’re less likely to end up in hospital for their asthma.Track your child’s asthma symptoms using a diary or a symptom calendar.Prepare for going back to school by arranging for your child to have an asthma review with their GP or asthma nurse to check your child’s medicines and make sure your child has spare, in-date reliever inhalers to take into school.Parents whose children have asthma can access support through our nurse helpline.Last year we helped nearly 1,000 parents who called on behalf of their child with asthma.For information and support on how to manage your child’s asthma during the summer or to download a written asthma action plan visit www.asthma.org.uk/safersummerDr Andy Whittamore, Practicing GP, Clinical Lead at Asthma

The Aqualibrium is not where most people want to cross.\u0026#8216People going to and from the Co-op and Tesco want to cross at the junction between them.\u0026#8216Likewise, people going to the harbour from the town centre want to cross at the Royal Hotel.\u0026#8216As it is, as a driver I was unaware the town had any crossings, apart from the pelican crossing in the Main Street. None are marked for drivers.\u0026#8216Is there any point in having them if drivers do not know they are there?\u0026#8216If they are indeed crossings, mark them. All road users need to know what they are in the interest of safety.\u0026#8217Mark Sutherland: \u0026#8216I have on several occasions crossed the road near the Co-op, and due to the speed of some inconsiderate drivers have had narrow misses. As for reporting to the police, this is ridiculous as the police would not really be interested as they have enough to do.\u0026#8216It is obvious if you stand there long enough that several people try to cross and give up or take a chance.\u0026#8216A crossing is required, especially for the elderly and infirm, as they can not make it across as quickly.\u0026#8216Common sense needs to be implemented by the right authorities to ensure that pedestrians can cross safely.\u0026#8217\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"pedestrian crossings","story":"There are also no traditional pedestrian pelican crossings.

supplies during the current period of hot summer weather.Following a sustained dry period without any significant rainfall, customer usage has increased significantly.With the current weather conditions forecast to continue people should take simple but important steps to conserve public water supplies.In some areas there has been a 30 per cent increase in demand for water during the summer and an additional 140 million litres are currently being produced and pushed through the system every day.The situation is being monitored closely and  to manage supplies across the country.This includes deploying additional resources to move water between distribution areas and tankering water to supplement local networks.Some water treatment works and distribution networks are working at near capacity to meet demand.Average reservoir levels are generally normal for this time of year but the current level of usage and continuing dry weather means stocks of stored water available for use are reducing.Try to reduce usage wherever possible.Businesses are also being asked to consider their usage and how they can use water more efficiently.Simple, practical steps include: taking shorter showers, using a watering can rather than a hose to water plants, using a bucket rather than a hose to wash vehicles only washing windscreens/lights instead of the whole vehicle, turning off taps whenever possible, use washing machines and dishwashers fully loaded.Scotland’s public water supply is the lifeblood of the country, for household and business customers and more than 1.3 billion litres is used per day.There is a strong and resilient water distribution network but everyone will need to play their part as Scotland enjoys its hottest and driest summer in many years.To help customers use water wisely, advice is at www.scottishwater/savewaterscotland or by calling 0800 0778778.Peter Farrer,Chief Operating Officer,Scottish

Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.

The stainless steel sculpture depicts aspects of Musselburgh\u0026rsquos history with images of agriculture, people, connections to the sea, the river and the Romans. The face of the sculpture is mirror polished and reflects whatever stands before it.  Mr Johnson, from Nottinghamshire, sees these two aspects of the shell, the memory and reflection, as metaphors for a work which interprets the history of the town and offers a reflection of how the town is viewed now.  A working group made up of community representatives selected the mussel shell for the commission. Mr Johnson undertook activities with local groups and schoolchildren to create designs for bronze inserts incorporated onto the main sculpture.

Fears were raised back in 2016 that the day centre might be forced to relocate or even cease to exist in its present form because a new day centre facility could not be accommodated within the current building.  East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership needed to provide at least 18 places of registered day care for people with complex care needs in Musselburgh given that it was the largest town in East Lothian. This was in line with need identified as part of a wider review of older people\u0026rsquos day centres.  This led to the partnership and the Hollies exploring the options available, which ranged from potentially adapting the current building to accommodate 18 people through to looking at possible other buildings if the Hollies couldn\u0026rsquot be adapted.  After nearly two years of talks, and Care Inspectorate and architects\u0026rsquo input, it was found that, in order to adapt the Hollies premises, the lunch club and public cafe would be lost at the expense of more than 100 users.  A joint decision remains to be made about the eight day care places already in existence at the Hollies current premises but, at present, there is agreement that these places will continue.  The health and social care partnership is now looking for somewhere else in Musselburgh to accommodate the other 10 places.  Following a meeting this month, the Hollies trustees have confirmed that agreement has been reached with the health and social care partnership that the status quo will remain at the day centre.  In a joint statement, the trustees said: \u0026ldquoThe Hollies distributed a consultation paper to service users and had 271 responses completed in two weeks. The overwhelming consensus of the people consulted is for the Hollies to continue providing the service it does now for the people of Musselburgh and surrounding areas. We have also received positive feedback on our proposed expansion of activities in the hall in the afternoons.  \u0026ldquoWe have agreed with the health and social care partnership that the Hollies should remain as it is. We are looking forward to continuing to work as before and to embark on exciting new projects to meet the wishes of all those who attend the Hollies.  Liz Shannon, centre manager, said: \u0026ldquoFunding is a constant battle for us all at the Hollies and we have been in limbo whilst these talks were taking place and have been unable to approach funders as we were unclear what funding we were asking for.  \u0026ldquoThe health and social care partnership has assured us they will continue to give funding at the current level for this financial year which is \u0026pound82,000 to continue to fund the eight registered places which we are grateful for in this transition period. However, that is less than a third of what it costs to run all our services and maintain the building.  \u0026ldquoThings are going to be very tight for the near future while we submit funding applications to funders like the lottery however, we are very excited at the prospect of moving forward and very grateful for the support from the people of Musselburgh and beyond.  Councillor Fiona O\u0026rsquoDonnell, health and social care spokesperson, said: \u0026ldquoI am pleased that the Hollies will continue to provide a wide range of services in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoThis was a really positive meeting and the plans to provide more activities in the Hollies are good news for local people.  \u0026ldquoThe health and social care partnership will continue its work to increase the amount of day support in Musselburgh for older people with complex care needs."},{"url":null,"title":"flag-ceremony-held-to-mark-armed-forces-day","story":"  The ceremony marked the start of a week of celebrations across Scotland to mark the contribution members of the armed forces make.

A large number of residents left East Lothian in service of their country \u0026ndash many of whom, tragically, would never return.  \"Sadly, in the 100 years since, the world has seen all too many conflicts \u0026ndash some on a large scale, others more confined. In war, and in peacetime, our armed forces have promoted peace and security, confronted terrorism, and delivered aid to those in need.  \"That\u0026rsquos why, as Provost of East Lothian, I value occasions such as Armed Forces Day. A chance to give thanks, remember, reflect and look ahead.\"  Mr McMillan also paid tribute to the role of women in the military and in times of conflict, noting that 2018 was also the 100th anniversary of the first women being given the vote.

Among the issues highlighted at the public meeting were long waits to get through to the surgery by telephone failure of repeat prescriptions poor communication with patients very long waiting times to see a named GP lack of continuity of care and treatment difficulties with NHS 24 and test results not being given out by doctors.  Concerns were also raised about GP training and recruitment, the area\u0026rsquos growing population causing additional pressures on local health services, the cost of calling the surgery and the idea of an online booking system.  Last Wednesday, Ms Dugdale asked the Scottish Government what discussions it has had with NHS Lothian regarding general practitioner services in Musselburgh.  Shona Robison, who was Cabinet Secretary for Health and Sport at the time, said: \u0026ldquoNHS 24 is delivering a pilot at the Riverside GP practice in Musselburgh whereby it is triaging patients who have requested same-day GP appointments. Where appropriate, NHS 24 will signpost patients to areas of the primary care system that are better placed to meet their needs, often more swiftly. \u0026ldquoIndications are that the pilot is working well, with a number of patients signposted to more appropriate support, freeing up GPs to deal with patients with more complex needs. A full evaluation is underway with a report due in the coming weeks, which will be shared with health boards and integration authorities.  Ms Dugdale commented: \u0026ldquoEarlier this month, 200 angry Musselburgh residents turned out at a public meeting because they have had real and persistent difficulties in accessing GPs locally. They do not think that the pilot is working that well. Many of the problems are caused by a GP shortage - a point that the practice and the British Medical Association have acknowledged. Can the cabinet secretary explain to my constituents why they have to phone NHS 24 to see their GP and when she expects Scotland\u0026rsquos GP shortage to be resolved?  Ms Robison said: \u0026ldquoThe pilot that NHS 24 is running is a system that has worked well elsewhere and that has had strong evaluation, so I urge Kezia Dugdale to wait for the formal evaluation of the pilot. I am happy for her to be furnished with the evaluation if she would be interested in that.  \u0026ldquoWith regard to the way forward for general practice, she will be aware of the new contract that has been put in place with substantial resources to back it up. In this financial year, we will invest \u0026pound100 million to support the new contract, and we also have the ambition to increase the number of GPs by at least 800 over the next 10 years. In addition, the multidisciplinary team will make sure that we can reduce the workload of GPs.  Mr Whitfield told the Courier: \u0026ldquoAt the recent GP public meeting, Kezia and I agreed to take the concerns raised back to the practice, but also to NHS Lothian and the Scottish Government. Kezia has acted swiftly to challenge the Health Secretary on the issue and demand she does more to alleviate the problems experienced in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoWe have also passed on the issues and questions highlighted at the meeting to the practice. Once we receive a response we will share it with those who attended. We will also keep up the pressure locally and nationally for further action to help patients here receive the service they need.  Mr Dugdale later said the appropriate steps needed to be taken to support \u0026ldquostruggling GP practices and prevent further closures.  Miles Briggs, Lothian Conservative MSP, who also took part in the Holyrood debate, later said: \u0026ldquoThe Health Secretary\u0026rsquos assurance that the pilot is working well in Musselburgh is totally at odds with the experience of many local patients who have expressed very real concerns about delays in getting through and arranging a routine GP appointment.  \u0026ldquoMinisters and NHS Lothian need to respond to what are genuine issues being experienced by local residents and to take urgent action to address these."},{"url":null,"title":"harry-potter-stars-are-heading-to-musselburgh-this-summer","story":"  Stars of the movies will be taking part in the summer event which is being held at Loretto School and raising funds for Children\u0026rsquos Hospices Across Scotland (CHAS).

Yet it is so easy to rush past all the magic which is just on our doorstep.  And as I watched the wee frogs swimming in the pond last week, I discovered just how much I don\u0026rsquot know and have missed.  That\u0026rsquos the joy of having young children, I think: they are a passport for you as a \u0026lsquogrown-up\u0026rsquo to explore the world with a sense of fascination that we all once had, and can be rekindled.  You see, I\u0026rsquod never actually thought about how a tadpole changes into a frog.  In the day-to-day living of life I suppose it\u0026rsquos understandable it is not an issue we will spend too much time thinking about.  But as I watched the wee frogs come up from the mud to the surface to breathe, then swim down again, I realised we were looking down on a simple but fascinating miracle of nature.  Then a wee frog literally jumped from a stone onto my son\u0026rsquos hand.  He could have squashed it or even been frightened by it, but instead he said \u0026ldquowow.  The wee creature jumped from his hand onto mine, obviously looking for a way back to the safety of the water.  Carefully, and a bit reluctantly, he helped the wee \u0026lsquobaby frog\u0026rsquo back into the water where it swam back down to the mud.  That\u0026rsquos when I realised I knew about the process without knowing about it.  There were some frogs which looked like late developers compared to their cousins, for they seemed to be more tadpole than frog, still swimming about with a tail between their developing frog legs.  The whole spectacle was, honestly, fascinating. I found myself being in awe at the process that we all know about but don\u0026rsquot really know about.  And so as summer has reached us, I am determined to make it a Safari of Discovery on our doorstep.  I will share this journey with you the places, stories and folklore attached to them. And while I cannot claim to be an expert on nature, I know its spiritual importance and I think that is a good beginning.  My first port of call will be the wood of what my kids call the \u0026ldquoserpent trees.  Where is that? You\u0026rsquoll find out next week!  In the meantime, I will have to keep this week\u0026rsquos page short as it is my daughter Manja\u0026rsquos ninth birthday and I have mermaid tails to connect. . ."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7697530.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"council-calls-for-rejection-of-substation-plans","story":"  East Lothian Council will submit its formal objection to the proposals to a Scottish Government reporter after officials were given the unanimous support of elected councillors at a meeting of the local authority on Tuesday.  A planning application for the substation by Inch Cape Offshore Limited (ICOL) was called in by Scottish Ministers in a controversial move in April and will now be decided by the reporter instead of the council.  ICOL wants to bring offshore energy from a planned windfarm off the Angus coast onto land at Cockenzie by building the substation on the footprint of the former power station.  A previous planning application siting the substation further inland had been given planning permission but that permission lapsed instead of renewing it, ICOL decided to pursue a new site.  In its argument to Scottish Ministers, the council will state that the substation is \u0026ldquonot the best use of the land and point out that planning permission had been given at another site.  Councillor Norman Hampshire said: \u0026ldquoBecause of the location, we have to recommend it should be refused. We have done a lot of work to move this proposal forward and this action jeopardises that.  \u0026ldquoI think if everybody had worked together we could have got a development on a site the council, developers and communities could have supported.  Earlier this month, representatives of ICOL were challenged by Prestonpans Community Council to name any independent party that support the planned location of the substation.  Brian Weddell, community council chairman, told the ICOL representatives that there had been no public consultation about the new site.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe are against it, Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council are against it, East Lothian Council and Scottish Natural Heritage are against it.  \u0026ldquoShow us anyone, apart from Inch Cape, who think it is a good site.  Ian Johnson, ICOL project manager, said: \u0026ldquoWe are naturally disappointed that East Lothian Council officers have recommended refusal to the application on the grounds that it could prejudice future development of the area. ICOL have been and will continue to work with the council to look at options to reduce the footprint of the site and ensure that other potential future developments can co-exist next to the substation.  However, he made it clear there were no plans to consider an alternative site, telling the Courier: \u0026ldquoWe have no intention of moving the proposed site of the onshore transmission works again.  The reporter is due to visit Cockenzie on Monday as part of her investigation into the application."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7994954.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"glory-days-of-golf-remembered","story":"  Musselburgh Museum on High Street is hosting an exhibition called \u0026lsquoMusselburgh \u0026ndash Cradle of Golf\u0026rsquo which is aimed at reasserting the Honest Toun\u0026rsquos importance in the sport\u0026rsquos rich heritage.  Boasting one of the oldest golf courses in the world \u0026ndash Musselburgh Links, The Old Course \u0026ndash the town was once home to the Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers, who now play at Muirfield, near Gullane.  The Honourable Company brought other Edinburgh clubs to the town such as Royal Burgess, Bruntsfield and the Warrender.  The exhibition celebrates the days from 1836 to the early 20th century when Musselburgh was at the forefront of the game\u0026rsquos development.  It not only celebrates the golf clubs which played in the town over the years but also the many golf club and ball makers, and professional players, who made their living in the town between 1836 and 1900 \u0026ndash a period of dramatic growth in the game.  The display has been organised by Musselburgh Museum and Heritage Group in partnership with Mungo Park, whose great-grandfather Willie Park Senior, from Wallyford, won the first Open Championship at Prestwick in 1860 and went on to be a four-time Open champion.  Willie\u0026rsquos brother Mungo and son Willie Junior were also Open champions at Musselburgh Links.  Two other local men \u0026ndash Bob Ferguson, who won a hat-trick of Open Championships, and David Brown \u0026ndash complete the town\u0026rsquos five Open champions, with 11 wins between them.  Support for the exhibition has also been received from East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos economic development and strategic investment department and Musselburgh Common Good Fund.  The exhibition, which runs from July 6 to September 1, is to be officially opened by Lord Wemyss, whose family has been involved with golf since the early 18th century.  On display are a large number of golf items and memorabilia donated by golf clubs that were formerly located at Musselburgh Links. Artefacts from the British Golf Museum and private collections can also be viewed.  The exhibition includes significant artefacts that have not been seen publicly in Scotland for decades, among them Charles Lees\u0026rsquo famous painting A Summer Evening on the Musselburgh Links: Golfers, which recently sold at Bonhams.  Organisers say the display shows Musselburgh\u0026rsquos leadership in developing golf and exporting it.  The museum is open on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays from 10.30am to 4pm each day."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8006789.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"coast-road-closed-after-car-overturns","story":"  Police said one person was trapped in a car which has overturned and they have closed the road while work to free them is carried out.

The land had previously been owned by Sainsbury\u0026rsquos who had permission for a new supermarket there but their long-stalled plans were finally ditched when they sold the land earlier this year.  A public exhibition took place at the town\u0026rsquos John Gray Centre last Tuesday where those behind the plans were on hand to answer local residents\u0026rsquo questions.  Alex Mitchell, director of Zander Planning, admitted there had been a \u0026ldquomixed reaction from the people who turned up.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe have had a great turnout \u0026ndash some people have been supportive and think that it will be of benefit to the town but others are worried about what it will do to the town centre.  Alastair Dickie, development director at Ediston Real Estate, which are behind the plans, added: \u0026ldquoI think there have been a lot of valid comments.  The names of the businesses looking to move into the site have not yet been revealed but it is hoped that their identities will become public by the time a planning application is submitted to East Lothian Council.  Mr Mitchell hopes a detailed planning application will be lodged before the end of the summer. He said: \u0026ldquoIf we can get an application in by about September then we\u0026rsquore probably looking at six months for planning [approval]. If we get [that] we could be on-site in spring 2019.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom sure retailers would want to be open before Christmas but that is probably a bit tight so we\u0026rsquod be looking at early 2020.  Mr Mitchell also attempted to allay fears over the volume of traffic on the road by adding: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore looking to create a filter lane so people coming in [to the new retail park] would not cause queues for people getting into the town.  Paul Darling, one of the planning liaison officers at the town\u0026rsquos community council, attended the exhibition.  He said the buildings proposed were \u0026ldquougly but added: \u0026ldquoI am not against the plans, I just think the buildings have to be more in-keeping with the rest of the town.  \u0026ldquoI think that it could actually bring people to the town but it is a bit of a worry what could happen to the shops in the town centre.  The site had long been earmarked for Sainsbury\u0026rsquos after it won a lengthy battle with Tesco to build on the site in 2013."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8009220.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"dunbar-student-heading-off-to-the-olympics-of-tech","story":"  A games development team, made up of students from Abertay University, will take on the best in the world at the Microsoft Imagine Cup in Seattle.  The competition \u0026ndash dubbed the Olympics of Tech \u0026ndash seeks out the most innovative and potentially world-changing software solutions and comes with a first prize of $100,000.  Among those representing the Dundee university is Emily Peterson, from Dunbar.  She said: \u0026ldquoThey are sending the first and second place teams out to Seattle for the competition, which is in the last week in July.  \u0026ldquoIt is quite exciting, I\u0026rsquom just the artist on the team.  \u0026ldquoI do the models and particular effects and textures.  The team, who make up Blacklight Games, created Firepoint \u0026ndash a first-person mixed reality simulator which aims to bring a new level of realism to firefighter training.  Using HoloLens and Windows Mixed Reality technology, the game allows trainees to see through the eyes of a firefighter as they make their way through a multi-storey training ground tackling a variety of different issues.  It is hoped the simulator can eventually be used at open days or recruitment fairs.  The former Dunbar Grammar School pupil told the Courier the idea had evolved over time before resulting in the final product.  Originally, proposals looked at creating a game involving a maze.  However, a discussion with a firefighter saw the focus of the project, which is the work of eight third year students, change.  Emily said: \u0026ldquoMatthew McAuley, from our team, had a friend who worked for the fire service.  \u0026ldquoI think he got the initial from there and said why don\u0026rsquot we come up with that.  \u0026ldquoWe had been making the initial concept like a maze and it is something you can still see in the final build of the game.  In April, the team from Abertay University took part in the UK finals of the Microsoft Imagine Cup in London.  A team from Manchester University was crowned the overall UK winner with Abertay finishing as the runner-up.  Now, both universities will send teams to the final.  The Abertay team are focusing on making the simulator better before they head to Washington.

A post from the youth project said: \u0026ldquoOver the past three years, young people have been looking at youth provision in North Berwick and have been shocked to learn just how much has been lost and never replaced.  \u0026ldquoThe team have been working hard to receive advice from East Lothian Council on what can be put in place to ensure a safe environment for all, as well as actions which can be taken to discourage anti-social behaviour. The young people would like to re-build the shelter with wider community involvement.  But Kathryn and Douglas Paul, who live at Glasclune Gardens, would prefer to see the shelter demolished.  Mrs Paul said that, while she was not against giving young people a place of their own, she felt the shelter \u0026ndash which sits to the rear of the home the couple have lived in for 18 years \u0026ndash was not the right location.  The couple told the Courier they had experienced long-standing anti-social behaviour from youngsters who already gather at the shelter.  Mrs Paul said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove had bottles thrown into the garden \u0026ndash they are loud and they get up to all sorts. It\u0026rsquos been going on five or six years.

They also found five secondary tumours at the top of his spine.  By the age of 13, the brave teenager had completed a high dose of radiotherapy to his brain and spinal cord following a biopsy.  Despite his health challenges, Paul, who is now 30, received a Bachelor of Engineering with Honours in Computer Systems and Networks degree at a graduation ceremony at the Usher Hall last week.  His family, including mum Angela, 52, and sisters Laura, 34, and Aleigh, 21, were filled with pride to see him receive his degree.  He was also awarded the Rob Kemmer Prize, receiving \u0026pound100 in recognition of his \u0026ldquooutstanding achievements on his individual programme of study.

She said: \u0026ldquoPaul was having trouble with his eyesight and the school contacted me to say they thought it was getting worse.  \u0026ldquoIt was when he was referred to the Eye Pavilion in Edinburgh they discovered the tumours were the cause of it.  \u0026ldquoHe had multifocal germinoma tumours and secondary cancer caused the spinal lesions.  Although the radiotherapy cured his tumour, it had other detrimental effects.  Paul is registered blind as a result of the radiotherapy to his visual nerves and also has a curvature of the spine.  The pituitary gland in his brain has failed completely, so he needs to take hormone replacements and he also finds it difficult to open his jaw, which is thought to be due to scar tissue following radiotherapy.  It was when he was working as a volunteer at Musselburgh Citizens Advice Bureau that Paul first became interested in developing his computer skills, attending both Edinburgh College and Napier for four years.

A meeting of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos licensing board last Thursday heard that since the Peters took charge of the pub there had not been a single complaint about it.  Now the couple have applied for permission to turn the building next door \u0026ndash which currently operates as Jo\u0026rsquos Kitchen \u0026ndash into a pub which they plan to name the New Pheasant.  The name is a reference to the building\u0026rsquos previous history as The Pheasant pub before it shut in 2009.  Mr and Mrs Peters\u0026rsquo agent highlighted articles in the Courier to the licensing board that showed the problems at the Gardeners Arms before the couple took it over.  He said: \u0026ldquoBefore they took over there were some interesting Courier articles which described the pub as a disgrace.  \u0026ldquoSince they took over, the Courier articles were about a disgraced pub being turned around.  Applying for a major variation to the current licence held by Jo\u0026rsquos Kitchen, the agent said that the Peters\u0026rsquo current role managing the Gardeners Arms was coming to an end next month and they were keen to move on to their own establishment.  The board heard two objections had been received, along with two letters of support, all from neighbouring residents.  Both objections raised concerns about noise, as well as pointing out that there were already three pubs in the town with \u0026lsquoto let\u0026rsquo signs up. But the board was told the fact other pubs were available to let was not relevant.  Rudy Fruzynski, East Lothian licensing standards officer, told the board he was happy to support the application, confirming that there had been no complaints about the operation of the Gardeners Arms since the Peters took over.  He added: \u0026ldquoIn recent times, the anti-social behaviour team has received a substantial complaint made by a resident in the area complaining about late-evening noise with persons congregating on Market Street and using nearby Cross Lane as a thoroughfare from High Street.  \u0026ldquoThis problem cannot be directly attributed to licensed premises on Market Street.

And council official admitted that while the income from the charges was increasing year on year, it was not expected to come close to the \u0026pound300,000 included in the administration\u0026rsquos budget for this financial year, with an estimated gross income of \u0026pound238,000 predicted.  It was also revealed at a meeting of the council\u0026rsquos policy and performance review committee that the council pays the Earl of Wemyss one third of the income from Longniddry Bents car parks No 1, No 2 and No 3, on top of a \u0026pound10,000 lease, as the car parks are part of the Wemyss and March Estate.  Since the introduction of the charges in 2015, those three car parks have brought in just under \u0026pound75,000 in income.  In total, the money collected from the 10 coastal car park sites which charge since it was introduced has been \u0026pound343,212.45.  However, the cost of the scheme was questioned at the meeting.  East Lothian Council introduced a \u0026pound2-a-day charge for using the three Longniddry Bents car parks and those at Barn Ness, Gullane Bents, John Muir Country Park, Shore Road at Belhaven, Tyninghame Links, Whitesands and Yellowcraig in 2015.  The initial cost of introducing the scheme, which included ticketing machines, signs and introducing double yellow lines at various locations, was about \u0026pound900,000.  A further \u0026pound425,000 is earmarked to be invested this year in improving toilet facilities at the Longniddry car parks.  Season passes are available for \u0026pound40 a year and just under 3,000 are currently being used.  A report on the income from the car parks revealed that in its first year the scheme brought in \u0026pound98,795 with costs of \u0026pound4,977.  However, it said in its second year the gross income was just over \u0026pound169,000 while costs rose substantially to nearly \u0026pound94,000.  In the last financial year, gross income grew to \u0026pound188,000 while the costs were at about \u0026pound83,000.  Among the reasons given for the rise in costs were \u0026pound55,000 which is paid towards East Lothian\u0026rsquos private parking attendants and the cost of replacing machines which had been vandalised by people trying to break into them, as well as rental fees for the Longniddry car parks and payment to a private company which collects the money from the machines and provides IT access so they can be monitored.  Peter Forsyth, service manager with the council, said the cost of replacing four machines last year had been \u0026pound25,000 and he revealed there was an unusual bug problem.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe have been affected by equipment failure due to bugs, earwigs and such, who like to nest in the equipment. They are not covered by our warranty.  Councillor Paul McLennan, who is part of the SNP Group which has opposed the car park fees from the start, said he estimated that, between costs of the scheme and interest generated from the initial loans, in its second year it would have made just \u0026pound6,000 profit.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe business case is not stacking up.  However, Jim Lamond, the council\u0026rsquos head of finance, said the scheme was never intended to make profits.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt is not in the budget as an income-generating activity. It is in there for improving the coastal car parks and ultimately that has been done.  Councillor Jeremy Findlay (Con) said people in his ward in Gullane did not feel they were seeing improvement in facilities at their car park. He said: \u0026ldquoIt was sold to people as a way to invest in facilities and they are not seeing it.  However, Councillor John McMillan (Lab), cabinet spokesperson for economic development, said a review would have to take in the bigger picture.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt needs to look at the impact on economic development and benefits it is bringing into East Lothian as well.  The committee agreed to ask for a detailed review of the scheme."},{"url":null,"title":"delve-into-haddingtons-history-this-summer","story":"  An exhibition of the history of Haddington opened its doors at the John Gray Centre last week in the town as it celebrates 700 years since King Robert The Bruce awarded it a Royal Charter.  The collection looks at seven centuries of life in the town and was officially opened by Provost John McMillan who brought along a portrait of his grandfather, who shared his name and joined the army in 1918 as one of many underage young men keen to defend their country.  Mr McMillan said he hoped the exhibition would encourage people to explore their own family history and look into their ancestry.  The Bruce Charter, which is the oldest document held in the John Gray archives, is not on display during the exhibition because it has to be kept in conservation conditions, but people can view it during the archive\u0027s opening hours.  Some of the less ancient items were on display at the Haddington Show at the weekend when archivists from the centre set up a stall in the crafts tent.  There they displayed some old images from shows gone by and a book of the show\u0027s records from 1820.  Interestingly some of the family names in the nearly 200-year-old records were still well know in the communities.  Exploring themes such as royalty, religion, health, education, wartime and crime and punishment, the exhibition aims to bring stories from the archives to life.  Haddington was one of the most important towns in medieval Scotland, and even had a royal palace, the birthplace of King Alexander II.  One of the items on display is a sick note from Mary Queen of Scots \u0026ndash the Queen asks the burgh to excuse Philip Gibson from military service because he was too corpulent to ride his horse!  Other characters featured include Agnes Blaik and Elizabeth Golight, two ladies of ill repute who were accused of entertaining dragoons. Both were convicted \u0026ndash Elizabeth Golight in particular was named a \u0026lsquovicious strumpet\u0026rsquo by the court. They were sentenced to stand at the market cross with a paper announcing their crime attached to their clothes, and thereafter they were to be drummed out of the town.  In medieval Haddington crime certainly did not pay and punishments were harsh. Criminals could be sentenced to death and the burgh account books include costs for building the gallows and the purchase of ropes for executions.  Gallows Green (where Bellevue House stands) gets its name from being the place the gallows were situated, and there is evidence that hangings also took place from the Nungate bridge.  Punishments for lesser crimes were harsh and cruel \u0026ndash those caught stealing could be sentenced to a whipping by the hangman, banished from the burgh, branded with the town key, or have an ear nailed to the pillory post!  While much of the exhibition concentrates on the medieval period more modern topics including the Glasgow Overspill are featured.  In 1958 Haddington signed the first Overspill Agreement in Scotland with Glasgow which was bursting at the seams with a post war housing crisis while other parts of the country were sparse. Haddington Town Council agreed to provide 250 houses for Glasgow families, increasing the town\u0027s population by 20 per cent.  which would result in a 20% increase in population. The original Overspill Agreement is on display in the exhibition.  This exhibition offers a glimpse into the lives of the townspeople of the past, and tries to demonstrate the central role Haddington played in events of national significance. Seven Centuries of Haddington is on display until the end of September and is well worth a visit."},{"url":null,"title":"new-life-coming-for-pub","story":"  Officers were called to the Masons Arms on Belhaven High Street at 6.50am on March 31 following an undisclosed incident.

However, at a meeting last week, the board was told that Mr Darling had parted company with the pub owners and the premises was currently closed.

Mr Hughes told the board that he was preparing to sign a five-year-lease of the pub with its current owner in a deal which would allow him to buy it at the end of the lease.  He said that there were plans to renovate the building to open it up more and make it a family-friendly site.  Mr Hughes told the meeting: \u0026ldquoWe plan to make it a good country food and beer premises.  \u0026ldquoIt is in an area steeped in history with [Belhaven] Brewery and a popular tourism area, and we want to turn it into a good welcoming family pub.  Mr Hughes, who has been at Dunbar Golf Club for several years, told the board he had more than 23 years of experience in the licensed trade and had worked in Edinburgh before moving to East Lothian.  He said that if given approval to go ahead the pub could re-open early next year.

Assembly host Bryden McKinnie, told the Courier, he received news from the Food Assembly UK operators on Friday afternoon that they were no longer operating in the UK.  The assemblies, which started in France, have been operating across the UK for five years.  They provide local hosts with the support to set up a website where local producers can offer their goods for sale and customers can browse online filling a \"shopping basket\" with products from a number of different companies.  They then collect all their shopping at one place on a set evening of the week.  The Haddington Assembly has held weekly collections at the Maitlandfield House Hotel since it began, with a wide range of local suppliers.  More than 1250 people have become members of the assembly in East Lothian but host Bryden said one of the issues to faced was building regular customers to make it sustainable.  He said of the 100 plus members only around 50 shop with any regularity and if the assembly was to continue in another form it was important to understand what stopped the other members from using it.  He said: \"It is difficult to sustain when you do not have a lot of regular shoppers, and this is a common thread among all the UK food assemblies.  \"We are talking to each other and looking at whether we can come up with a new way of operating, the announcement from the Food Assembly came as a shock and has really rocked everyone, but we are looking to the future.\"  The Haddington Food Assembly will stop at the end of this month.  However Mr McKinnie said alternatives would be looked at if it received a boost in its support.  He said: \"During the summer months orders can fall as low as 10 a week which is not sustainable. It really is a case of \"use it or lose it\".\"  A spokesperson for the Food Assembly said no public statement on the withdrawal was being made before the end of August.  She said: \"The announcement has been made to our network of hosts and producers, many of them will communicate to their members when they are ready, and we will do a public communication in August.\""},{"url":null,"title":"talented-teenage-drummer-clara-wilberforce-joins-national-youth-pipe-band-of-scotland","story":"  Clara Wilberforce, who has been playing the snare drum since she was in P6 at King\u0026rsquos Meadow Primary School, has linked up with the National Youth Pipe Band of Scotland\u0026rsquos development band.

Proud mum Juliet told the Courier it had been an eventful period from the audition to finding out that Clara had been successful.  She said: \u0026ldquoShe went to the National Piping Centre in Glasgow and she did her audition and she came out and said \u0026lsquoI did so badly, I messed up\u0026rsquo.  \u0026ldquoShe was so disappointed and I said to her that she was very young.  \u0026ldquoShe was terribly disappointed but I said \u0026lsquonever mind, you are young and will get another chance another year\u0026rsquo.  \u0026ldquoShe had been in tears and she felt she let herself down.  \u0026ldquoWe forgot all about it and then suddenly emails were coming through to her and myself.  \u0026ldquoShe came tearing down the stairs screaming at the top of her voice that she got into the development band.  \u0026ldquoShe was running round the house, up and down the stairs screaming with joy.  Her first event will feature Phil Cunningham and Aly Bain at the Phil and Aly RSNO St Andrew\u0026rsquos Day Concert at the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall on November 25.

Clara, who is in S5 at Knox Academy and studying Higher maths, English, geography and human biology, is also a member of the school\u0026rsquos pipe band as well as Haddington Pipe Band, where she is a senior drummer.  Her mum, who praised the efforts of Davey Barnes, who runs Knox Academy Pipe Band, and Dave Henry, drum teacher, said Clara \u0026ldquoloves the drumming and she had made a number of good friends through music and boosted her confidence.

Now his son Kit, who lives in Belhaven, has released a new version of the tale which looks at Chris\u0026rsquo 30-year career with the company, its characters and ships.  The company, which provides a link to many of the Scottish islands from the mainland, dates back to 1851 and has become famous for the red and black funnel, complete with the Lion Rampant, on its ships.  Kit said: \u0026ldquoWe self-published it the first time and having, finally, persuaded him to write down all the stories I found a way of getting it published.  \u0026ldquoWe printed about 400 copies and the punchline is, despite him giving a few away, we got enough money back to cover the publication cost.  \u0026ldquoAs far as I know it is sold out \u0026ndash I have got a copy and so do both my sons but I think that is about it.  \u0026ldquoThe reason we published it in the first place was, certainly to us, the highly entertaining stories about MacBrayne.  \u0026ldquoThere was a lot in it about his army service and, after coming back to it after all those years, the reason for publishing it again was just to make sure those reflections on a way of life long gone did not die with him.  Kit \u0026ndash who last year released The Triumph and Tragedy of the Bantams, which focused on a band of \u0026ldquobrave but largely forgotten soldiers \u0026ndash has added his own stories of being a \u0026lsquoMacBrayne Child\u0026rsquo.

However, the first study of its kind in Scotland reveals a \"rapid halt\" in long-term breastfeeding 500 years ago.  Archaeologists obtained tiny bone fragments from the remains of 67 children buried at Aberdeen\u0026rsquos St Nicholas Kirk the 12th to 18th centuries and analysed them to estimate the age at which they must have been weaned off breastmilk.  They found a \"sudden\" reduction around the 16th and 17th centuries.  Dr Kate Britton, who led the study at Aberdeen University, said: \u0026ldquoIt is often thought that a relatively short period of breastfeeding \u0026ndash of around six months - is something that emerged later in the 18th and 19th centuries.  \"But our study points to a very different picture with this change occurring much earlier.  \u0026ldquoBreastfeeding and weaning practices tell us a great deal about changing \u0026lsquosocial norms\u0026rsquo and wider economic and cultural changes.\"  The individuals buried in Aberdeen would have been fairly affluent and middle class, but the findings correspond to previous bio-archaeological studies in England indicating that the decline in duration of breastfeeding was occurring across all classes.  Dr Britton said further research is needed into the reasons why trends in breastfeeding changed 500 years ago, but among wealthier women it is thought it may have declined in popularity because it interfered with their outfits or pursuits, such as playing cards.  It also coincided with the expansion of cities, which accelerated the spread of ideas, and post-Reformation Protestantism which promoted the mother\u0027s role in childrearing and made wet nurses taboo.  Dr Britton said: \u0026ldquoBy analysing our data in conjunction with the results of these previous studies, we can see that trends were very similar across England and Scotland.  \"For example, we can see that middle class people in Aberdeen were behaving in same way as those in London workhouses a century or so later.  \u0026ldquoWe can only speculate as to why this might be but increased urbanisation, women working outside the home and cultural changes following the Reformation may be contributing factors.  \"Furthermore, maternal nursing was seen by some as inconvenient and unfashionable, interfering with social pursuits.  \u0026ldquoAn alternative was wet-nursing, but there also seems to be a corresponding decline in the social acceptance of wet nursing in this period, with medical writers and physicians in the later medieval period and into the 16th and 17th centuries discussing the link between the personal attributes of the person feeding an infant and the baby\u0026rsquos character.  \"Red-heads, for example, were to be avoided as wet-nurses as they could make a baby hot tempered with their milk.  The findings are published in the International Journal of Osteoarchaeology."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/8046282.jpg?type=article-full","title":"native-birds-flock-back-after-feral-mink-are-culled-in-western-isles","story":"  For decades American mink shipped to these shores to be farmed for their fur have driven birds from their nesting grounds after breaking free and going feral.\u0026nbsp  But now victory has been declared in battle against the invasive species in one of the country\u0027s wildest regions following a 17-year long eradication campaign.\u0026nbsp  Wildlife which had been on the retreat in the Outer Hebrides is reported to be flocking back to its traditional breeding grounds, bringing a boost to tourism and restoring the sound of birdsong to colonies which fell silent years go.\u0026nbsp  Populations of terns, waders, divers and ducks - which were all previously on the mink\u0027s menu - have rebounded after a concerted effort was made to capture thousands of mink roaming free and reduce the numbers on the loose to a bare handful.\u0026nbsp    Arctic terns in flight  The success of the programme is a rare example of a successful pushback against a foreign species which had become entrenched in its new habitat.  American mink are famed for their fur and have been farmed across the world for decades.\u0026nbsp  Approximately a foot long, and said to resemble otters with fluffy tails, the animals are voracious, semi-aquatic carnivores which prey on the eggs of ground-nesting birds while competing with them for fish and shellfish.\u0026nbsp  They were introduced to the UK in the 1950s and fur farms were established on the Isle of Lewis in the 1960s. These soon went out of business, but mink escaped and quickly spread across the outer islands.    Small scale control operations were carried out by sporting estates and an attempt was made by SNH to prevent the animals\u0027 population spreading south, but these measures had little effect.\u0026nbsp  By 1999 breeding populations of mink were thriving on North Uist and Benbecula and, while fur farming was banned in the UK in 2,000, numbers of mink in the wild reached a greater density that those seen in similar locations in North America. \u0026nbsp  However, since the start of the Hebridean Mink Project in 2001, almost 2,200 have been caught by trappers working full-time. Numbers have now dwindled to such an extent that only two non-breeding females and a few associated males were caught in Lewis and Harris in the past 18 months.    A read-throated diver and her chick  Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH), which mounted the campaign against the feral mammals, said that they have been successfully cleared from an area the size of Fife which includes Harris, Lewis Benbecula and both North and South Uist. \u0026nbsp  SNH Chairman Mike Cantlay, said: \u0026ldquoWe are delighted that all the hard work has been successful for the nature of the Hebrides.\u0026nbsp  \"At the project\u0026rsquos height a group of just 12 core SNH staff worked as teams of trappers to remove mink, and help bring back native birds to one of the remotest, wildest landscapes anywhere in Scotland.  The successful programme has also delighted locals, who are thrilled to see the return of wildlife lost to the minks\u0027 appetites.  Murray Macleod, an operator with tourist boat provider SeaTrek, said: \u0026ldquoBoat operators are already starting to see the results of the mink project.  \"We have changed our tourist routes this year, because in places where there used to be no bird populations to view now we are seeing colonies of terns with chicks.  \"It\u0026rsquos been an incredible boost to local tourism \u0026ndash and of course you can\u0026rsquot top the delight on visitors\u0026rsquo faces when they see our native birds thriving.  "},{"url":null,"title":"jeremy-hunt-named-as-new-foreign-secretary","story":"  Jeremy Hunt, the longest serving Health Secretary in the history of the NHS, has replaced Boris Johnson.  Mr Hunt has been replaced at health by former culture secretary Matt Hancock, who is in turn replaced by the former attorney general Jeremy Wright QC.  A Remain supporter, Mr Hunt has since converted to Brexit, and is seen as a potential replacement for Mrs May as Prime Minister.  His promotion means all four of the great offices of state - Prime Minister, Chancellor, Home Secretary and Foreign Secretary - are now occupied by Remain campaigners.  Mr Hunt praised Mr Johnson as \"one of the great driving forces in British politics\" and thanked him for his efforts after the Novichok nerve agent attack.  He said: \"My principal job at a time of massive importance for our country is to to stand four square behind the Prime Minister so that we can get through an agreement with the European Union that was agreed by the cabinet last week at Chequers.  \u0026ldquoThis is a time when the world is looking at us as a country, wondering what kind of country we\u0026rsquore going to be in a post-Brexit world.  \u0026ldquoWhat I want to say to them is that Britain is going to be a dependable ally, a country that stands up for the values that matter to the people of this country, and we\u0026rsquore going to be a confident voice in the world.  Mr Hunt\u0026rsquos move came after one of the most dramatic days at Westminster in years, with Mr Johnson\u0026rsquos resignation coming hot on the heels of that of Brexit Secretary David Davis.  In a stinging resignation letter, Mr Johnson said the dream of millions of Leave voters was \u0026ldquodying under Mrs May, and her planned soft Brexit would make the UK a \u0026ldquocolony of Europe.  Mrs May said she was \u0026ldquosorry and a little surprised at the comments.  An MP since 2005, Mr Hunt has been in Cabinet since the Tories returned to office in 2010.  As culture secretary he oversaw the 2012 London Olympics, although his most memorable moment was ringing a handbell on TV until it snapped and flew at a bystander.  His surname has also led to several unfortunate slips of the tongue by TV and radio presenters.  After the Olympics, he was moved to health, clocking up almost six years in post.  He was so attached to the job, he refused to move in Mrs May\u0026rsquos January reshuffle, and extracted a promise of extra funding to mark the 70th year of the NHS.  He never been far from controversy.  The 51-year MP for South West Surrey is the richest member of the cabinet.  He made a fortune last year after selling an education business he set up, and in which he had a 48 per cent stake, for \u0026pound30m.  He also set up a property company with his wife which he failed to declare in his parliamentary register of interests on time and had to apologise earlier this year.  Multilingual, on paper he has more diplomatic skills than Boris Johnson, but was recently criticised for telling companies such as Airbus not to comment about Brexit.  He faces an intense first week on the job.  He is due to to join Mrs May at the Nato summit in Brussels on Wednesday, followed by President Donald Trump\u0027s visit to the UK on Thursday.  Scots LibDem MP Christine Jardine said: \u0026ldquoJeremy Hunt has been set a devastatingly low bar by his predecessor when it comes to basic competency, with him leaving a litany of errors in his wake.  \u0026ldquoMr Hunt does, however, also face an impossible challenge when it comes to advocating for Britain around the world at a time when his Conservative government are doing huge damage to our economy and influence in their pursuit of Brexit.  Backbench MP Geoffrey Cox, a barrister who once represented the notorious property millionaire Nicholas van Hoogstraten, is the new attorney general for England and Wales.  One of Mr Cox\u0026rsquos first big tasks will be representing the UK government in its attempt to strike down Holyrood\u0026rsquos alternative Brexit Bill as the Supreme Court later this month."},{"url":null,"title":"alesha-macphails-mother-thanks-island-people-for-their-help","story":"  Georgina Lochrane, who also goes by the name Genie, took to a local Facebook group for locals on the Isle of Bute to reach out to them following her daughter\u0027s death.

Still, they were only the Brexit Secretary and the Foreign Secretary, who may have reached their decisions because Theresa May treated them as peripheral. Despite his letter, David Davis\u0026rsquos resignation came not because the Chequers proposals crossed his \u0026ldquored lines by much, but because he was cut out of a say in them.  Instead, Mrs May entrusted her plan to a civil servant, Olly Robbins, her Europe Advisor and former Permanent Secretary at the Department for Exiting the EU, essentially sidelining her minister. That shows such bad judgment that it should be (and may soon be) grounds for a challenge to her leadership.  Cue Boris. The fact that the Foreign Secretary\u0026rsquos departure was, apparently, announced by Number 10 yesterday afternoon while he was still writing his resignation letter corresponds with my memories of waiting around for his column to arrive, so that I could edit it. My personal experience doesn\u0026rsquot enable me, alas, to divine the exact rationale for his leaving, though I suspect that the future of Boris Johnson figures large in it.  At any rate, here is where we are now, though the problem is partly the other way round. The Brexit referendum determined where the UK wanted to go from, but not its destination, beyond the cheery expectation that it would be broad sunlit uplands where democracy and prosperity would flower unchecked.  This is true even for those who voted Remain. That was no more a vote for the status quo than \u0026ldquoLeave determined which form of Brexit we would get: the EU is, by its own definition, an evolving project of \u0026ldquoever closer union with \u0026ndash as we\u0026rsquore now constantly told \u0026ndash strict insistence on certain fundamentals.  The fact that there are observably everywhere exceptions to these unbreachable principles is either one of those mysteries, like \u0026ldquoman is born free but everywhere in chains, or indicates that the statement was nonsense to start with, like \u0026ldquosheep are born carnivorous but everywhere eat grass.  But let\u0026rsquos assume \u0026ldquoBrexit means Brexit, whatever that means, and consider the possible destinations. Some people argue for a leaving which amounts to staying, like my mother when she says \u0026ldquoGoodbye on the telephone and then embarks on a two-hour account of what the rest of the family has been up to for the last month. One suspects that, for example, Anna Soubry and Sir Keir Starmer have this in mind when they talk of respecting the vote while staying in the Customs Union, Single Market, ECJ, CAP, CFP, Eurodac, Enisa, Eurojust, Uncle Euratom Cobley and Europol.  Others, like Jacob Rees-Mogg and the European Reform Group (ERG), seem keen to tell the EU that we don\u0026rsquot want to play with them any more, are keeping our \u0026pound38 billion ball and going off to play under WTO rules. These attitudes, and the split they represent in the Tory Party (though Labour MPs have their own equally intractable divisions), has been compared with the Corn Law movement.  Though it was Robert Peel (a Tory) who finally did repeal the Corn Laws, and the measure was proved right, Conservatives might also remember that it split the party so comprehensively that it took almost 30 years before it recovered as a viable political force.  The Radical Whig, Cobden \u0026amp Bright approach acknowledges that free trade has done more to increase prosperity than anything else in human history. But (like so many truths) it is a minority view. Free marketeers talk approvingly of \u0026ldquodisruption and Joseph Schumpeter\u0026rsquos \u0026ldquocreative destruction, but even if those forces are right in the long term \u0026ndash as history has shown them to be \u0026ndash the short-term costs and shocks are by no means negligible.  That may be why even Douglas Carswell, of all people, has expressed his puzzlement at ERG resistance to the proposals set out at Chequers, arguing that it is still recognisably leaving. More to the point, he and others who are relatively relaxed about compromises worry that setting red lines where the ERG wants them risks not getting any Brexit at all. This, obviously for different reasons, also seems to be the calculation of many Remainers unapologetically seeking a second referendum, who therefore want any other option to fail.  Michael Gove\u0026rsquos position when supporting (though in a rather lukewarm fashion) the Chequers plan on Sunday was, pragmatically, that detaching ourselves from the EU will take time and that some things \u0026ndash such as some ECJ supervision, or maintaining regulatory alignment in specified areas \u0026ndash may be a price worth paying in the short term. We can always decide, further down the line, that they are holding us back, or a bad deal, and renegotiate or withdraw from them then.  Mr Davis\u0026rsquos and Mr Johnson\u0026rsquos departure should not disguise the fact that the overwhelming problem with the Chequers proposal \u0026ndash tied up with its being the product of civil servants and technocratic politicians of the sort that, alas, Mrs May has turned out to be \u0026ndash is that it is no more than a wishlist. Delivering it might, in the end, satisfy Leavers, but just now it is merely an opening sally in negotiations against the EU, which will take it as a starting position, reject great chunks of it and ask for more.  Actually to get what the remains of the Cabinet have reluctantly agreed on, Mrs May should have sounded a little bit more like Mr Rees-Mogg making noises about WTO rules. If she could then get what the hard Brexiters call a sell-out, it might prove to be something for which most voters would happily settle.  Her current travails and her dismal performance in the Commons yesterday suggest that\u0026rsquos a very long shot. But then, the assumption she\u0026rsquoll still be secure in her post next week might be that, too."},{"url":null,"title":"167-schools-throughout-glasgow-contain-asbestos","story":"  But education chiefs have sought to put parents\u0026rsquo minds at ease after it was claimed that children running through corridors could disturb the toxic substance.  In total 167 primaries, secondaries, nurseries and assisted support needs schools in the city contain asbestos.  Specialist officers are employed by the city council to monitor education facilities to ensure asbestos is not disturbed and cannot become harmful. But Hope Robertson, secretary of the Clydebank Asbestos Group, which covers the west of Scotland, said: \u0026ldquoAsbestos costs an arm and a leg to remove but you can\u0026rsquot put a price on children\u0026rsquos lives.  \u0026ldquoKids run through corridors, they bang doors and that\u0026rsquos all it takes to disturb asbestos and make it go airborne.  \u0026ldquoParents should be aware of the fact that they can request a look at the asbestos register. Schools must be able to produce that.  \u0026ldquoFolk say we\u0026rsquore scaremongering but schools, especially the Consortium of Local Authority Special Programme (CLASP) facilities, have the old pipe insulation systems in them. They are covered in asbestos.  Seven CLASP schools and 18 secondaries throughout the city were identified as having asbestos. Those included Holyrood Secondary, St Mungo\u0026rsquos Primary and the all-girls Notre Dame High School.  In the west of the city, 50 nurseries, primaries and additional support needs schools were revealed as containing asbestos, with 42 on the Southside, 29 in the East End and 21 in the north.  If undisturbed, asbestos does not pose a health risk but, if material containing it is damaged, fibres can enter the lungs, causing asbestosis if exposed over a prolonged period.  The council said: \u0026ldquoWe have a robust management programme in place to ensure safety in all our buildings.  \u0026ldquoWhilst there are times where removal is appropriate, it is also true that on many occasions asbestos is safer when left alone and managed appropriately.  \u0026ldquoAsbestos that remains undisturbed presents no risk and it\u0026rsquos very unhelpful to worry parents unnecessarily."},{"url":null,"title":"little-sympathy-for-mrs-mays-meltdown-in-brussels","story":"  As they absorbed the impact of the Prime Minister losing her Brexit and Foreign secretaries within 24 hours, EU leaders said they would carry on working as normal.

Six monthly treatments are still on-going.“Once again, CLAN have been a valuable support to me at another extremely challenging time of my life.”The Purple Walk is a 10K walk around Kemnay, starting and ending at Bogbeth Park.

We saw a higher number of lots and greater values of items sold, which is an increase from last year’s June sale.“Our reputation as Scotland’s largest collective plant, machinery and equipment sale, alongside the power of the auction system, can be attributed to the high prices at this sale, along with the weaker sterling currency and strong export demand.”                                                                                                        The next sale is scheduled to take place on Saturday, August 18 from 9am.

It will provide on-board workshops, spare parts storage, crane and office facilities but will get supplies from another large vessel. By contrast the BOWL project will use smaller crew transfer vessels on a daily basis to provide crew and supplies.\u0026ldquoIt is just a different strategy being used at MORL and we could not accommodate that size of vessel at Wick as we do not have the shelter and water depth required, he said. \u0026ldquoIf we had our new quay at Shaltigoe we would have been able to accommodate it.But Mr Watt is confident the harbour will still play a part in servicing the MORL project and in other renewable projects in the Moray Firth basin. He pointed out that Wick is 33 kilometres from the wind farm while Fraserburgh is 70km away.\u0026ldquoWe wish Fraserburgh and Moray East well and will continue to develop Wick harbour, Mr Watt said. \u0026ldquoWe will move forward on a strong footing in the renewables market as well as in the fishing and cargo sectors.He added that work on the BOWL base is progressing well and will create upwards of 150 jobs.Caithness civic leader Willie Mackay said: \u0026ldquoIt is very disappointing news. Hopes were high this project could come to Wick. There have been a lot of improvements going on at the harbour which has the potential for a positive future.\u0026ldquoI hope other projects can come to Wick and I look forward to seeing improvements on the platform the BOWL project creates for the town and the community in general. I hope we can bring lots of jobs and apprenticeships to the area.Trudy Morris, chief executive of Caithness Chamber of Commerce, was \u0026ldquovery disappointed by the decision as the Wick harbour team has worked \u0026ldquoextremely hard to make the port an attractive base.\u0026ldquoAs the larger of the two offshore wind projects proposed for this area, it would have been a significant boost to the harbour and the region to have MORL based here, she said.But she added: \u0026ldquoIt has been fantastic to see the progress made at Wick harbour this year in preparing for the Beatrice Offshore Windfarm Ltd operations and maintenance contract, and we look forward to the benefits this will bring to the area.Eann Sinclair, programme manager for the Caithness and North Sutherland Regeneration Partnership, was also disappointed by the decision. However, he is confident there will still be opportunities for Wick harbour to get work in the Moray Firth area.MORL spokesman Craig Milroy said Wick was in the running for the O\u0026ampM base along with Buckie and Fraserburgh. A memorandum of understanding had been signed with Wick.\u0026ldquoAll three were strongly engaged with us but we chose Fraserburgh, he said. \u0026ldquoThere was not a single reason for choosing Fraserburgh but a combination of circumstances.

The move would save \u0026pound300,000.Five of the proposed closures were in Caithness and included Thurso harbour, the Camps at Wick, Halkirk, Keiss and Lybster.The council hoped nearby local businesses would adopt the Highland Comfort Scheme and provide public toilets at their premises in exchange for a monthly fee.But there was widespread opposition throughout the north to the closure plan which was seen as damaging to the area and its tourism industry.Caithness civic leader Willie Mackay backs the reprieve.\u0026ldquoI absolutely welcome this, he said. \u0026ldquoThis review will give us the opportunity to look at local needs and those of the tourists. It may also give us an incentive to reintroduce the comfort scheme and think about other ways of running the public toilets.\u0026ldquoIf we could get a fixed rate for things like electricity and get development trusts or local communities to look after the toilets that would be a great help. I am pretty confident we could get people throughout the county to help out.\u0026ldquoElectricity companies make huge amounts of money and a little consideration from them would go a long way.Highland Council announced the review after it listened to feedback from communities across the north.Councillor Allan Henderson, the chairman of environment, development and infrastructure, said there is \u0026ldquono quick fix to the problem.But he added: \u0026ldquoThis is about working with communities and potential Highland Comfort Scheme providers to enable a different public toilet delivery model that is sustainable and affordable in local communities.The decision means the toilets under threat of closure will now remain open until the end of October.The controversy over the proposed toilet closure plan has led to local MP Jamie Stone writing to First Minister Nicola Sturgeon.In his letter he stresses the contribution tourism makes to the local economyHe describes the plan as \u0026ldquoa backward step which will lead to \u0026ldquogreat inconvenience for locals and visitors alike and said it is being driven by the need to make budget savings.The Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross MP asked the First Minister if additional financial support could be provided to keep the toilets open.\u0026ldquoAny help that can be afforded by the Scottish Government would be very gratefully received by the Highland Council and the people of my constituency, he said.Meanwhile, Highland Council has agreed to review its car-parking policy.The local authority\u0026rsquos redesign board has recommended a new \u0026ldquovision for parking that will addresses traffic management, integrated transport and local economic growth and tourism. It will be \u0026ldquoapplied consistently and fairly across Highland, a council spokeswoman said.Under the plan, the budget and decisions on parking would be devolved to local committees with revenue reinvested locally.Tuesday 10 Jul 2018 1:37 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116272.jpg","title":"Wick High School pupils light up UK Apps for Good finals with bike success","story":"\u0026nbspThey won the Emerging Technology award at the UK Apps for Good finals in London on Wednesday night after wowing the competition judges with their Light Bike \u0026ndash which deploys smart lights to help cyclists safe and visible.The pupils \u0026ndash Nicholas Mann (13), from Ulbster, Caleb James (14), from Kirk, Lewis Buchan (14), Russell Mackenzie (13) and Steven Gunn (16), all Wick \u0026ndash were led by their computing science teacher Chris Aitken.Speaking after the finals at London\u0026rsquos Rich Mix venue, Mr Aitken said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore absolutely delighted to have won the Emerging Technology award at the UK Apps for Good finals.

This could run into millions of pounds and put at risk the future viability of the business.The company have also met with local Orkney MSP, Liam McArthur, to express their concerns about the delay.As the start of this month, as Mr Matheson stepped into the shoes of the previous minister for transport Humza Yousaf, it was announced that lack of agreement between the Scottish Government and Pentland Ferries had led to no discounted fares being introduced in Pentland Firth ferry routes, by the Government\u0026#8217s self-set deadline of the end of last month.Andrew Banks, Managing Director and Owner of Pentland Ferries said: “We want these passenger subsidies implemented as soon as possible but we need to be 100 per cent sure that the scheme complies with state aid rules.  We have never had any subsidy from the government and even though this scheme gives money to the passenger, not the operator, the minister has told us that we would be liable for any repayment if at a future date the scheme is deemed illegal. This could run into the millions and could finish us off.“We cannot take that risk and we have a responsibility to our staff, our community and family to make sure the scheme works for everyone. We want to work with the Minister and his team to discuss a way forward so that we can all benefit from reduced fares. This scheme will be fantastic for our business, attracting more visitors to the islands and making it cheaper to travel to the mainland for residents. So we want this unlocked as soon as possible. We welcome the Minister’s willingness to gain a full understanding of the detail and very much hope to be able to meet him in Orkney soon.”The minister, Mr Matheson, was asked for a response to the comments from Pentland Ferries and Mr Banks. At the time he replied, Transport Scotland said the invitation had not yet been received so the minister could not comment.However, Mr Matheson did say: “The Scottish Government remains committed to delivering reduced ferry fares to the Northern Isles. I am conscious that there is a great deal of interest in this issue amongst users of the services. As I begin my new role as Transport Secretary, I want to ensure that I gain a full understanding of the detail — it is already very clear to me that planning to introduce reduced fares on the Northern Isles network has been a complex and challenging piece of work.“As a first step, we will cut fares on the Aberdeen-Lerwick and Kirkwall-Lerwick services from June 30. These reductions will be around 20 per cent for both passengers and cars.“On routes to Orkney, it has been necessary to engage with commercial operators on the Pentland Firth. We set out a very fair and reasonable proposal that would maintain competition, enabling them to protect their existing market share. Unfortunately, not all the commercial operators have felt able to agree to our proposals. This means we cannot currently implement reduced fares on any of the routes to and from Orkney without the risk of legal challenge.“This is both disappointing and frustrating, but I am determined to work through the issue to see what more can be done. I have asked Transport Scotland to undertake some further work to see what measures, if any, we can take. As part of that, we are willing to reopen talks with commercial operators.  I will provide a further update to stakeholders and to Parliament as soon as I can, with a view to bringing the full benefits of the scheme to the people of Orkney and Shetland.”\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This will help reduce the initial barrier of connection for a defined period of time.Two events are planned at the St Magnus Centre in Kirkwall, from 6pm to 8pm on Wednesday July 11 then from 10am to 12pm on Thursday July 12 with a further event at the Doubletree by Hilton, Glasgow Central, from 10.30am to 12.30noon on Friday July 13 and finally, a webinar will take place on Tuesday July 17 from 10am to 12pm.Registration is required for the Alternative Approach consultations via the following link: https://www.ssen-transmission/news-views/articles/2018/6/solving-orkney-s-catch-22/Commenting on the Alternative Approach consultation events, Lauren Milligan, commercial policy manager, said: “As a customer-driven initiative, stakeholder engagement has shaped the Alternative Approach proposal to date.“We want to ensure that we develop a solution that not only works for network companies but also the wider industry and other connection customers and would therefore encourage anyone with an interest in our proposed Alternative Approach trial to register for one of our consultation events.”The final stage of consultation is planned to take place in Autumn on the various components of the transmission reinforcement project in advance of submitting planning applications to the relevant planning authorities, the Scottish Government, Marine Scotland and Orkney Islands Council.The progression of the project is subject to all necessary planning consents and securing regulatory approval from industry regulator Ofgem, with the Alternative Approach trial also subject to regulatory approval.For more information on the proposed Orkney transmission reinforcement, including links to both consultation documents, click here.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Each of the three winding barrels will have a small motor fitted, and a sensor, which will automatically detect when the clock has wound down to a certain level. In addition, the clock will also be fitted with a pendulum regulator, which will ensure the clock time is more accurate.Cathedral custodian Fran Hollinrake said: \u0026#8220It is the end of an era. It was always a great workout climbing the tower stairs and manually winding the clock, but it was just becoming too impractical with all our other duties. The clock will still be the clock, it will just have a couple of new bits added on.\u0026#8221The previous clock on St Magnus Cathedral dated from 1761, and was made by Hugh Gordon, a clockmaker in Aberdeen. But during the early 20th century, as part of the Sheriff Thoms bequest, a new timepiece was commissioned that would see the cathedral through the 20th century and beyond. The present clock was made when the world was at war, in 1915, although it was not actually installed until 1919, the same week that the Treaty of Versailles was signed that ended the First World War.James Ritchie and Son (Clockmakers) was founded in 1809, and the company specialised in large steeple and public clocks, both making and restoring. If you are familiar with Princes Street Gardens in Edinburgh, you will know the world-famous Floral Clock, not far from Waverley Station. It was made in 1903 by Ritchie\u0026#8217s, and was the first of its kind in the world.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

What you’ll need:              • 500g Canadian strong white bread flour (or a flour with a high gluten content, i.e. at least 14 per cent) • 30g lard or vegetable shortening • 10g sugar • 10g salt • 5g fast action yeast             • 400ml cold water For the Coating • 50g plain flour • 50g rice cones/flourView our STEP BY STEP GALLERY HERE            Method: 1 Rub the fat into the flour in a large mixing bowl. Stir in the sugar, salt and yeast. 2 Now pour in the water and mix until it is all incorporated. This is a wet dough but when you are using bread flour with such a high gluten content it can easily take that much water without becoming sloppy. 3 Remove the dough from the bowl and knead it for 1 minute until the dough has just become smooth with all the ingredients thoroughly combined. 4 With such a long ferment you don’t need to knead it too much. Put the dough back into the bowl and cover loosely with cling film. Put the bowl in the refrigerator to leave it to ferment for 12 – 16 hours.             5 The next morning combine the rice cones and plain flour for the coating. Take a large baking sheet and dust it liberally with the coating mixture (make sure to leave enough to coat the rolls). 6 Empty the dough on to a work surface which has been liberally dusted with the rice/flour coating mixture. This is where a large silicone spatula or scraper is useful. 7 Now using a dough scraper divide the dough into 8 pieces. Don’t worry if it is sticky or messy as these rolls aren’t supposed to look perfect. 8 Dust your fingers with the coating mixture and take each piece of dough, one at a time, and dip it into the coating mixture and place it on the baking sheet. They don’t need to be in the shape of a roll but try to keep in the air that is inside the dough. 9 Do this with each piece, placing them near to each other so that when they rise they will bake together. Despite the stickiness of this dough the coating mixture works wonders for stopping the dough from sticking to everything. Leave them to rise for 1 – 2 hours or until doubled in size. 10 Bake in a 250˚C preheated oven on a high shelf for 15 – 20 minutes or until the tops are dark. The rolls should be well fired for the right flavour.• Recipe submitted by Fraser Wright Read more: The history of morning rolls, including a recipe for making your ownRead more: A history of the square sausage, including a recipe for making your own"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4766362.1531165163!/image/image.jpg","title":"nicola sturgeon keen to create scottish public owned energy firm","story":"        The feasibility of a Scottish state-owned energy company is set to be examined.

Theresa May has betrayed those 17.4 million who voted for Brexit with her latest plan, writes Brian Monteith                Well, does Brexit now mean Brexit? Does the Prime Minister’s Cabinet agreement on a negotiating position – more than two years after the British people voted to leave the European Union – amount to a craven capitulation or a triumph of pragmatism in the face of the EU’s intransigence?             The test must surely be to examine the proposal against what Theresa May has repeatedly told us, namely we shall be leaving the EU’s single market and customs union, we shall be controlling our own borders and we shall be free from the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. In other words, by regaining full sovereignty the UK will take back control.            The press statement that summarised the Prime Minister’s proposal, which will form the basis of a White Paper, has been examined by barrister Martin Howe, QC, a respected specialist in European law and adviser to Lawyers for Britain – and it has been found seriously wanting.His 18-page advice can be found at their website and is well worth a read but the telling phrase is this: “These proposals [therefore] lead directly to a worst-of-all-worlds ‘Black Hole’ Brexit where the UK is stuck permanently as a vassal state in the EU’s legal and regulatory tar pit, still has to obey EU laws and ECJ rulings across vast areas, cannot develop an effective international trade policy or adapt our economy to take advantage of the freedom of Brexit, and has lost its vote and treaty veto rights as an EU member state.”• READ MORE: David Davis resignation plunges government into crisisTo achieve unanimity around her proposal, the Prime Minister connived against her colleagues who have repeatedly given her the benefit of the doubt only to find that decisions taken in good faith on issues such as the single market and customs union are consistently reopened to be debated again.Consider this: Mrs May flew to Germany to reveal her proposal to Chancellor Angela Merkel before she had presented it to her own Cabinet in an attempt to obtain pre-approval. It is generally held that the EU was also given wind of what she was proposing and was asked not to dismiss it out of hand before any negotiations.             The Cabinet members were then given the 120-page document to read individually only two hours before their meeting started and had their phones and watches taken off them so they could not communicate details of the contents or the meeting. Meanwhile, civil servants behind the plan were leaking details of the proceedings as if they were commenting gleefully on Eurovision Song Contest entries.That a Prime Minister should seek to cut a deal behind the backs of her own Cabinet betrays that she is not negotiating for the best deal from the EU but on the contrary, is negotiating together with the EU against Brexiteers in the Cabinet who represent the 17.4 million that voted Leave. If that is not treachery I don’t know what is. What we are heading for is not a soft Brexit, as its supporters are portraying it, but a soft Remain that will in time become a hard Remain – for it will undoubtedly result in further concessions. The Prime Minister’s Chequers agreement is only her opening gambit and, by the example of her performance thus far, must mean further concessions along the way.To consider what May has done let us look at it from a Scottish context. Imagine Scotland voted to leave the UK in a second independence referendum, but in the negotiations for a new relationship with the UK the SNP Cabinet is divided because some fear a soft Indyref will tie Scotland forever to decisions by UK institutions such as Westminster, the Bank of England and UK Supreme Court. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon quietly jets down to London, meets the UK Prime Minister of the day and reveals the plans she will present to her Scottish Cabinet before they are able to read it and agree to it. Sturgeon, with the promise of no more than murmurings from the UK that it is only a good starting-point, comes home and threatens the collapse of the government and an early election if she doesn’t get her way.            That is what May has done, and it is nothing short of treacherous to the decision that was taken on 23 June, 2016 by the British people – and it is not even the final settlement. No matter how sweet-sounding its initial reaction, the EU will bargain for more.  One has to conclude that if May had shown as much cunning and sharp practice towards the EU and Michel Barnier as she has shown to her Cabinet members then she would have undoubtedly have won greater support and loyalty from those who have put their faith in her, only to be betrayed.As is the way of politics I doubt we have heard the last of this shameful episode in the Conservative Party’s history. Too many are looking to their ministerial careers, their superannuated pensions, their limousine lifestyle and ambitions. David Davis was meant to be the minister for exiting the European Union but has become the doormat for the Prime Minister’s kitten heels. On Friday she trod all over him, again. Boris Johnson fires off smart-ass one-liners like torpedoes, but they have ultimately turned back and sunk him, for he is finished as an alternative to May if he can’t do a Heseltine and storm out. Meanwhile, Liam Fox is on a mission to irrelevance who will want to discuss trade deals in any serious fashion with him now? Michael Gove was apparently the first Leaver in Cabinet to support May’s plan if true then he has excelled himself as the most duplicitous of all having stabbed Boris Johnson in the back during the Tory leadership election on the basis he would not have delivered Brexit, he has now knifed the Brexit movement completely.            Left isolated, Andrea Leadsom, Penny Mordaunt and Esther McVey have capitulated with their colleagues. Only a number of backbenchers, certainly too few if Labour backs May’s proposal, are wisening up to what it means.A Survation poll, carried out since the announcement, suddenly puts Labour ahead with the Tories dropping three points. It is only the beginning. The Cabinet may be united for the moment, but are all holding hands as they jump off an electoral cliff into that dark tarry black hole they are being warned about.• Brian Monteith is a director of Global Britain"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4766338.1531203441!/image/image.jpg","title":"tommy sheppard mp the uk is not a democratic country","story":"        It\u0026#8217s time the UK as a whole caught up with Scotland, Wales, and for that matter most of the developed world, by ditching its outdated voting system, writes Tommy Sheppard MP.                We need to talk about democracy in the UK. The UK Government recently hosted its first “National Democracy Week” – with no sense of irony. We absolutely should be celebrating the 90th anniversary of the equalisation of voting ages for men and women. Nobody would argue with that.            But we should celebrate that achievement precisely because it shattered an unjust status quo. And we still have an unjust status quo – a broken system that the Tories seem hell-bent on defending. The pomp and ceremony of Westminster may seem quaint to some, but its democratic system is as outdated as its traditions. Even putting aside the fact that most of the legislators are unelected Lords, the elected House of Commons uses, in first-past-the-post, a voting system to elect MPs that doesn’t even reflect the votes cast by the electorate.            The majority of seats shared by the Conservatives and the DUP was won with just 43 per cent of the vote. In fact we have had governments elected by a minority of voters for almost all of the time since World War II, while millions of voters are excluded at every election.READ MORE: Euan McColm: Proportional representation gets my voteThe same goes for local councils across England, where you find one-party fiefdoms without a single opposition councillor and absurd results like Plymouth and Wandsworth, where the party that lost the election won the most seats. I’m not pretending that elections in Scotland are perfect but at least the Scottish Parliament, with its proportional electoral system, reflects the votes cast. Our local elections also use a form of PR so that seats match votes and councils reflect the people they serve. And you can vote from the age of 16 allowing young people to get, and stay, involved in politics.The fact that we have managed to reach this point – of having democratic institutions that reflect the people – is worth celebrating, particularly given the vociferousness of opposition to this simple principle by politicians elsewhere in the UK.Proportional representation of voters is absolutely central to any modern democratic society – and it’s abhorrent that no Westminster government has ever genuinely asked the electorate whether they’d actually like Parliament to reflect the way they vote. Instead, the people were fobbed off in 2011 with a choice between the status quo and a system that is often even less proportional: the alternative vote.            Two-thirds of people believe that seats should match votes at Westminster, according to recent polling, and for as long as Scotland remains a part of the UK, the SNP will champion any moves towards making this a reality.READ MORE: Labour could win ‘more votes but fewer seats’ than Tories in ScotlandFirst-past-the-post governments elected on around 40 per cent of the vote are simply not democratic. It’s time the UK as a whole caught up with Scotland, Wales, and for that matter most of the developed world.Westminster would finally see governments that not only look like the people who voted for them, but that represent the views of the majority. That’s why the hundreds of volunteers from Make Votes Matter who took part in Demand Democracy Day on 30 June shouldn’t be ignored. You’ve got to admire their spirit. They organised around 60 street stalls across the UK – from Dover to Dundee – and invited members of the public to sign the new petition for proportional representation which calls on MPs to support it.

The Nationalist leader at Westminster said his party would “welcome” another election if the Prime Minister’s proposals for exiting the EU failed to protect Scotland’s interests.            Mrs May is due to publish a Government white paper on her Brexit plans next week, despite the turmoil caused by the resignations of David Davis and Boris Johnson.            The agreement reached at Chequers last Friday includes plans for a free trade area for industrial and agricultural goods, based on a “common rule book” and a “combined customs territory”.However, there will be different arrangements for trade in services including financial products, with the UK recognising neither side will enjoy “current levels of access” to each other’s markets.READ MORE: Nicola Sturgeon: SNP will press for single market membershipMr Blackford said if Mrs May did not alter her plans to bring them closer to this position, the SNP would “relish” the chance to fight another election.“If we’re talking about a situation where the Scottish economy is going to be threatened and if there’s an opportunity for us to have a debate with the people of Scotland, then of course I would welcome that,” he told the broadcaster.            “My focus in the short term, my party’s focus…is about protecting the interests of the Scottish people. That’s about making sure that we stay in the single market and the customs union.“If we faced an election as we go through that process then so be it, it’s something I would relish and something I would look forward to. I believe the SNP would come out of that in a strengthened position.”Challenged over the result of last year’s snap general election, which saw the SNP lose 21 seats in Scotland including those of Alex Salmond and Angus Robertson, Mr Blackford was defiant.“The SNP are still the dominant voice, the dominant party in Scotland. We’ve been the government party in Scotland for the last 11 years,” he said.            “I would firmly believe that if we had to put ourselves in front of the electorate again, we’d get the overwhelming backing of the people of Scotland.”"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.\n\nThe project, costing around £6 million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in 2006.

It has been a long journey for some and a hard fight to gain the ground and then keep it  for the new building. The building will provide not only better facilities and space but will also give staff the help in coordination and equipment to do there job under one roof with less strain and expense to all.\nI also claim nothing but most people that have lived in Shetland for the last 10 years will be aware of the problems associated with the Eric Gray building, whether directly involved or not although the thinking and planning of a new building goes farther back than that.\nSome parents and staff have had a look through the new building at different stages of build, and everyone to my knowledge was impressed.

It’s manufacture uses up valuable natural resources but this is a result of human exploitation. This begs the question, why are humans capable of natural behaviour and unnatural behaviour in what seems to be equal measure?  Is it normal and natural to drive cars, fly in ‘planes, build tower blocks, dig for coal, aim to fly to distant planet ? The list is endless. According to the experts, global warming and ice ages have occurred many times and certainly before life as we know it existed.  We are worried about what are threats to our welfare only because it is a seemingly an alien threat . Surely, if we are able to stand outside ourselves, we are now caught up in a “ normal” event. And in our short sighted stupidity we are adding to the dangers. But not causing them.I would venture to suggest that long after life has ceased on  this planet there will still be episodes of change which will also be natural and normal except there won’t be anyone around to grumble, fret or lead campaigns !!\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 19 ","story":"Shetland’s young sports competitors retained their hold on the Stuart Cup at the weekend, with the margin of victory, in the end, being fairly comfortable.\nGoing into the last event of the junior inter-county, the netball, Orkney had to win by 32 points to overhaul the visitors’ lead. Despite a brave and thrilling attempt, resulting in an 11-point victory, realistically the overall result was never really in doubt.\n The Shetland swimmers, led by triple record-breaker Jasmin Smith, once again defeated their hosts by nearly 20 points.\nSuperiority in the water is now a regular occurrence in inter-counties, and the days when Orkney maintained a stranglehold on that event have been confined to distant memory.\nPart of the reason for the continued success could well be the number of swimming clubs around the isles, with Shetland, Lerwick, Delting, South Mainland, Whalsay and the West Side all competing for honours.\nRegular events in Shetland could be just as important as the trips to the mainland, as it helps to forge the competitive element necessary in the inter-county.\nThe only disciplines in which Orkney were successful this year were hockey and netball, where apart from school tournaments in the latter there is no recognised league structure here.\nHuge credit is due to the swimmers and their coaches, and also the many others who put in so much time and effort at the other sports involved in the Stuart Cup.\nHere’s hoping that the hockey and netball contestants will not have long to wait for their own success.\n: : : : : : : :\nOn the subject of hockey, mention needs to be made of former goalkeeper Sarah Couper who is now a qualified A grade umpire.\nShe travelled away last weekend to take charge of two international matches and is off to Swansea today to umpire a home international masters game.\nThis is the pinnacle of officiating in hockey and should be seen as a fine achievement both Couper and the sport in Shetland, which faces the perennial battle for getting a new playing surface.\n: : : : : : : :\nCongratulations are due to the Lerwick Spurs football team which is now through to the fourth round of the Highland Amateur Cup.\nSpurs defeated Ness from the Western Isles 3-0 at Dornoch on Saturday and now face Caithness side Staxigoe in the last-16 clash.\nIt was the first of two successes against a team with the same name in three days and no hangovers were obvious as they returned and picked up an important victory over Ness United in the local premier league on Monday.\nThe other Ness may not mean much to the average Shetland football follower, but some may know it was the club that Angus Murray represented for a long time.\nMurray, who played for Lerwick Thistle for a couple of seasons in the mid-1980s while working at the town’s Co-op, commented on Facebook this week that it was the “wrong half of Lerwick but well done Spurs”.\nHe continued: “The competition is in the doldrums and in need of new talent. It would be quite something if a Shetland team could win it given the logistics. I’ll be watching with interest.”\nPressed on his Shetland connections, Murray went on: “The Spurs of my era were formidable \u0026#8230 Watt Bros, Leask Bros, B Williamson, K Malcolmson et al. I must say I had not heard of Jim Peterson’s passing. A scholar, gentleman and Spurs stalwart, we had many a chat in the Lounge Bar.\n“How removed we are at times. He wrote the The History of Shetland Football 1887-1987, a copy of which I have, one of his many accomplishments I’m sure. All the best in the next games. The competition does islands no favours on balance.”\nMurray, much like the way he used to play, is bang on target here. The tournament organisers do little to help the furthest travelled teams, and Jim Peterson is indeed a massive loss.\nWith the anniversary of the Milne Cup now under two months away, and a competition running (see above) to name Shetland’s greatest team, Murray’s name may be on the minds of a few selectors.\nAnd we could hope that Peterson, although this column is not normally the place for religious connotations, may be looking down and having a dram when the big event happens on 28th July.\n: : : : : : : :\nProfessional footballers, especially in the modern era, obviously have a lot of time on their hands.\nThat could explain why they indulge so much in the absurd tattoos and haircuts which are now commonplace.\nThe latest to make the news is Manchester City’s Raheem Sterling, who has gone and had the image of an AK-47 assault rifle inked on his lower leg.\nSterling, rather bafflingly, claimed the idea was a tribute to his father who was gunned down by a gang in Jamaica when he was just a toddler.\nNot surprisingly Sterling has been criticised by anti-gun campaigners, who demanded he remove the tattoo or be dropped from the England squad.\nRichard Taylor, whose 10-year-old son Damilola died after being attacked by a gang in London, has also accused Sterling of setting a terrible example to fans.\nThe player has now explained that he would never touch a gun and that the tattoo is “unfinished”. Maybe he intends to have a deletion mark added on top of the offending image?\nApparently, Gary Lineker of all people has jumped to Sterling’s defence, claiming it is “weird, unpatriotic and sad” for him to be criticised by the media in such a way prior to the World Cup.\nI’m sorry, but it’s not the fault of newspapers that Sterling appears to be lacking in grey cells. I’ve never been a fan of Lineker, but did think he would show more common sense than this.\nTaylor is correct. It’s a crass act by Sterling and just as daft a move by those who support him.\n: : : : : : : :\nTo end on a more postitive note, surely cyclist Chris Froome has to be one of the UK’s best ever sports performers.\nThe way he destroyed the field to secure the recent Giro d’Italia, the third Grand Tour title he currently holds along with the Tour de France and the Vuelta a España, was incredible.\nSadly this country has not really taken to Froome, otherwise he would have surely already been a recipient of the BBC Sports Personality of the Year award.\nIf he wins another Tour de France this year, which would be his fifth victory, it would be a travesty if he didn’t receive the personality trophy.\nBarring Harry Kane scoring a hat trick in the final and lifting the World Cup for England next month, which I can’t really see happening, hopefully this will be Froome’s year at last.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"kia pro ceed ","story":"3dr Kia pro-ceed sr7, 4 year warranty remaining, one owner, full Kia service history, VGC inside \u0026amp out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 20 ","story":"As I write this all the teams have played at least one match at the World Cup, with hosts Russia and Uruguay becoming first to qualify for the last 16 from group A.\nOn the whole it has been a decent tournament so far, helped by a few shocks along the way and some memorable goals, although perhaps the less said about the commentary and punditry the better.\nFew would have expected Germany to lose to Mexico, or Argentina to be held by Iceland. One of the most remarkable performances in the latter game came from Kari Arnason, recently deemed not good enough by Aberdeen but still able to do a pretty fair job on shackling Lionel Messi.\nThe introduction the Video Assistant Referee system, or VAR as it is commonly known, has caused a few talking points. There was the decision to allow Diego Costa’s first goal for Spain against Portugal, and also to award penalties to France and Sweden against Australia and South Korea respectively.\nThese “assistants” are apparently not even at the game. They are sitting in a office somewhere in Moscow, but bizarrely kitted out in full referees’ uniform!\nWhy on earth they didn’t disallow Switzerland’s equaliser against Brazil is beyond me, however. Everyone seemed to notice Steven Zuber’s push on his marker before making room for himself to head the ball home.\nEveryone that is except the boys in black in Moscow. The ITV panellists were unanimous in their opinion that the goal should have been ruled out. Even Roy Keane, who used to think decapitation was just about permissable, appeared to agree with the others.\nOkay, so we will mention the commentary and punditry. Apart from Keane and Slaven Bilic – I loved it when he said he couldn’t really care less about whether the Swiss leveller should have been allowed or not – there is really no-one who comes with an opinion which makes you think.\nMost of the time they are prattling on about how far England are likely to go, even when the focus is on an entirely different group. And surely it is high time Gary Lineker was pensioned off. His pathetic attempts at puns, which could have been written by a five-year-old, had their day a long time ago.\nMeanwhile in our office “World Cup Sweepstake”, which requires the entrant to basically predict the results all the way through the competition, things aren’t going too badly. Despite obviously getting the Argentina/Iceland and Germany/Mexico games wrong, plus a few others, I remain in contention on the leaderboard.\nSo what about the last 16? I will still stick with the Germans and Argentinians as surely they must improve.

The cricketer with roots connected to these parts was none other than the man of the match himself – batsman Callum MacLeod whose magnificent 140 not out was largely responsible for Scotland’s thrilling win.\nMacLeod’s father Donald attended the Anderson High School in the late 1960s and early 70s. He was a goalkeeper himself, playing for the Ness United team in the Shetland under-18 competitions.\nHe went on to make somewhat of a name for himself as a photographer, working for The Press and Journal and The Scotsman at times before establishing his own business.\nMacLeod (junior) has obviously usurped any success attained by his old man, however. Even before his recent moment of glory he has been an established international batsman, making several centuries at one-day level.\nHe has been good enough to play grade cricket in Sydney, which is no mean feat, has had stints at English counties Warwickshire and Durham and has just signed a contract with Derbyshire.\nIt is going on half a century since I last saw Donald MacLeod, but I know a certain former Whitedale goalkeeper who keeps in touch. If he happens to read this he’ll maybe pass on congratulations from me, and I’m sure a few others, to the family.\n: : : : : : : :\nTwo weeks ago I suggested that having clubs competing in a local league structure could be of great benefit to preparation for junior inter-county sports such as hockey and netball.\nWhile there is no regular junior league set-up in the isles for hockey, it has been pointed out that in netball this exists for primary school-aged players upwards.\nThe sport appears to be thriving at the various age levels, with under-13 and under-17 squads regularly competing on the mainland with success.\nThe Anderson High School team has also regularly sent a team to compete in the Scottish Schools Open competition, where they have performed with distinction over the past few years.\nThe AHS team also plays in division one of the senior netball leagues, while a feeder team called “Hotfooters” was created to provide easier access for youngsters to join the league.\nAccording to the organisers there have been over 1,000 competitive matches in Shetland and 32 competitive matches away from the isles for juniors this season in various leagues and tournaments.\nCoach Sanna Aitken says: “Of course it is disappointing that we lost the junior inter-county this year \u0026#8230 the girls were really gutted.\n“As a coach, I am delighted that the netball continues to be really competitive [with] an incredibly high standard of match demonstrating the hard work and success of the sport and junior set-up in both isles.\n“I am confident when saying the loss was nothing to do with any weaknesses in the local league structure. It just didn’t go our way on the day. Only two years ago it went Shetland’s way where we won on Orkney’s home turf. It’s always a great competitive game.”\nI am happy to set the record straight on this.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"watch viking bus station to get new graffiti mural ","story":"\n\nMarc Delaye, now based in Inverness, will oversee the graffiti project in August.

There is no doubt the English are cute enough to take full advantage of the introduction of VAR system with three penalty kicks so far despatched by captain Harry Kane.\nPenalising defenders for holding at corners and other set pieces is, I have to say, a major step forward. This has been going on for far too long in most levels of football, and thankfully the days of pundits uttering the words “part and parcel of the game” will now be over.\nGrabbing someone in a bear hug is not football – never has been and never will be. I recall a European match some years ago when Glasgow Celtic should have had about six penalties but the referee gave none.\nWhat this needs now is for officials to be in accordance with one another. But sadly, and I can envisage a few whistlers spluttering over their cornflakes at this, the words “consistent” and “referees” are an oxymoron as far as I\u0026#8217m concerned.\nOn the subject of the English progression in the tournament, it has once again thrown up the perennial question of whether Scottish people should support their oldest rivals.\nThere are no doubt many north of the border who would find the prospect of England winning the World Cup a terrifying one. They could even be in the majority. A recent poll suggested that only 15 per cent of Scots would support the English while 28 per cent would back anyone playing against them.\nThe same survey found that only two per cent of Scottish National Party voters would get behind England, although I actually find that figure quite high.\nIt does appear to be the case that Scottish football followers have nothing against English players, many of whom they actually admire, but it is those in the press and the media who they reserve their anger for.\nI sincerely hope that England do go all the way. I have always supported them when Scotland are not involved, and in recent years that has become the norm.\nA few issues do bother me, such as the constant gormless look on Kane’s face and the insistence of manager Gareth Southgate on dressing as if he was taking part in the World Snooker Championships. Someone should tell him that waistcoats are the most pointless item of clothing known to man.\nBut hey, most of it is good. I particularly enjoy the ITV panel and even Ian Wright is growing on me!\n: : : : : : : :\nIt is just over a month since the tragic death of former Aberdeen footballer Neale Cooper and I would like to add my own tribute to the many which have been paid to such a popular man.\nThe late Neale Cooper made a memorable trip to Shetland.\nAt just 19 he was the youngest member of the 1983 European Cup Winners Cup side which defeated Real Madrid in the final at Gothenburg in Sweden.\nAlong with that memorable triumph he was in the team which won two Scottish league titles, four Scottish Cups, a league cup and the European Super Cup, all achieved before he was 24.\nHe later played for Aston Villa, Rangers, Reading, Dunfermline and Ross County, where he later became manager.\nIt was in the summer of 1999, when Ross County were invited to Shetland as guests for Scalloway’s centenary celebrations, that I had the privilege of meeting Cooper.\nThere was a gala dinner in the village hall after the friendly match where County defeated Scalloway 8-2, and he agreed to give me time for a short interview. But not until after his speech, he said, which he was dreading as he hated speaking at formal events.\nSadly the evening dragged on somewhat, with various Scalloway luminaries spending rather more time on stage than was really necessary, and it was approaching 1am when Cooper eventually got his turn.\nI decided to give up on the interview that night, and maybe catch him the following day after a game against a Shetland XI in Lerwick.\nAs I was wandering along the embankment at Gilbertson Park prior to the match I heard someone calling my name, and was surprised to see Cooper running towards me.\nHe was full of apologies about the previous evening, although he had no justification, and he said he would speak to me immediately after the game.\nThe match ended 2-2 and Cooper was generous in his praise for the opposition. Shetland were “as good as any top Highland League side”, he said.\nThe two-day visit had been excellent both from a football point of view and a social one, he added. “It’s been fantastic. We had a great welcome from Scalloway and it was an honour to be invited to their centenary celebrations. I’ve never been to Shetland before and I only found out last week that my mother had been here 40 years ago.”\nFollowing Cooper’s untimely death, and the loss of the first of the Gothenburg greats, there have been many kind words. Colleagues, writers and others have pointed out what a humble, friendly and likeable character he was.\nThey are absolutely correct. I’ve meet a few well-known footballers over the years but I have no difficulty in stating that Neil Cooper was the nicest one of them all.\n: : : : : : : :\nCyclist Chris Froome is now free to go for a record-equalling fifth Tour de France win after his anti-doping case was sensibly dropped.\nThe Team Sky rider had been under investigation by the sport’s world governing body Union Cycliste Internationale but proceedings were closed on Monday.\nFroome, who is bidding to move level with Eddy Merckx, Bernard Hinault, Jacques Anquetil and Miguel Indurain as the only five-time winners of the tour, has been under intense pressure since an amount of the asthma treatment salbutamol was found in his system.\nGet off this guy’s back and give him a break, I say. Just because he’s the best cyclist in the world does not mean he’s benefiting from a performance-enhancing drug.\n: : : : : : : :\nWith all the buzz of the World Cup an annual competition in southwest London has almost been forgotten about.\nYes, Wimbledon is in full flow once again and the British competitors are as usual struggling to make it into the second week.\nAndy Murray was probably sensible to withdraw, citing that he was not quite ready for five-set matches after his hip operation. There were signs at Queens and Eastbourne, however, that he may be able to scale the heights once more.\nThere is of course a capable replacement in Kyle Edmund, who is seeded having reached the Australian Open semi-finals earlier this year.\nEdmund’s half of the draw looks fairly open, and he could well still be involved come Monday.

the course of the three weeks.\n\"We do it for the buzz as we all have a passion for extreme weather and it is also a great way to hit the open road and explore new states,\" he added.\nHe agreed that it can be a dangerous hobby but not for the reasons you would think.\n\"People often think tornadoes are the main concern but lightning, giant hail stones and flash flooding are often the hazards that prove most deadly,\" he said.\n\"Careful planning before and during a storm chase is absolutely essential.\"\n\u0026nbsp\nScott now works for MetDesk, a UK-wide weather service, and he took those skills across the Pond with him.\nThe friends used the latest weather model data, satellite and radar observations and invested in a portable internet device to ensure they had the best chance of remaining connected to signal while on the move.\nScott said it is incredibly important that the driver can access accurate directions quickly when faced with dangerous and often changing conditions.\nAlthough they had a few close calls, they managed to avoid getting themselves into \"major trouble\" by knowing when to back off and take shelter.\nThe Newtonmore man explained: \"We avoided driving through storms with tennis ball sized hail stones and 70mph straight line winds.\n\"But at one point we did have to take shelter in a gas station freezer room \u0026ndash the strongest room in the building \u0026ndash due to a tornado with confirmed flying debris just upwind of us.\"\nScott admitted that storm chasing is not for the faint-hearted but that \"it is an experience\" and in the US it is becoming an increasingly popular attraction.\nBecause the adventurers did not know where they would end up at the end of the day, accommodation had to often be found late and in an obscure towns in the middle of nowhere\nScott, who is now safely back in Hertfordshire where the weather is rather less dramatic, added: \"That alone makes the trip more exciting as it holds an incredible depth of freedom.\"\nTornado Alley is the name of the area in the United States where tornadoes are most frequent.\nThe term was coined in 1952 as the title of a research project to study

Sabhal Mòr Ostaig principal Prof Boyd Robertson said, \u0026#8220This is a richly-deserved honour for Duncan which recognises the hugely important contribution he has made to the development of the college over many years and the vital contribution he has made to the development of the Gaelic language and culture and to the advancement of Gaelic and Gaelic-medium education, both as a teacher and as a former HM Inspector.”\n“Duncan\u0026#8217s critical input to Sabhal Mòr Ostaig’s development in its challenging formative years was marked by his steady stewardship, as a former chairman and his pioneering work, alongside that of his fellow trustees, demonstrated an exemplary vision and commitment without which what is now the National Centre for the Gaelic Language and Culture would not have existed.”\n“For that, all who have benefited from this wonderful and inspiring place, over the intervening years, owe him a great debt of gratitude and it is for that reason we celebrate with him here today. It is fitting therefore that his name will forever be associated with Sabhal Mòr Ostaig and with the development of Kilbeg village, a new sustainable Highland community which places Gaelic language and culture very much at its heart.”\nMs Forbes, extending her own congratulations to Mr McQuarrie, said: “This recognition of Duncan MacQuarrie is well deserved for his years of commitment to the Gaelic language and Sabhal Mòr Ostaig. The opportunities afforded to a new generation of Gaelic speakers are thanks to people like Duncan MacQuarrie who had the sheer determination, vision and love for the language to persevere. \u0026#8220Today, the education, employment and cultural opportunities enable Gaelic speakers to live and work in their preferred language in a way that would not have been possible without Mr MacQuarrie\u0026#8217s efforts.\u0026#8221\nPlans for the next phase of the affordable housing site \u0026#8211 which will soon be submitted for full planning consents \u0026#8211 will be delivered through a creative partnership involving Sabhal Mòr Ostaig the Highland Small Communities Housing Trust, the Highland Council and the private sector and will see the creation of up to 31 units of housing on the site.\nThe units will comprise a range of models and types of tenure, including rent to buy, self-build, housing for the elderly and, affordable for-rent housing. All tenures come with a rural housing burden attached to title, thereby retaining the housing stock in perpetuity for the benefit of those committed to living and working in the local area.\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/001WH2906NCA.jpg","title":"harold davis 1933 2018 from the korean front line to footballing glory and a spot of fishing in wester","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\n\n\nHis surname should in fact better reflect the Wester Ross area he’s called home for almost 40 years.\n“I like that to be known up here in MacKenzie country,” he notes from his home near Badachro, on the shores of Gairloch. “My mother was Catherine MacQueen Kirk, and my father was Angus Davis, though originally he was born Angus MacKenzie. The change came when my grandmother remarried, and so then the family name became Davis.”\nFor 37 years “MacKenzie country” has been his base, and these days it’s fishing rather than football which is his passion. Yet before making the move north with wife Vi to build the Craigmore Hotel in Gairloch, Harry Davis had enjoyed a remarkable sporting life — recovering from multiple bullet wounds in the Korean War to carve out a glittering football career with Rangers.\nTalk about “dual contracts” may have loomed large over Scottish football in recent months, but here was one ex-professional who really knew what it was like to serve two paymasters.\nA native Fifer, but brought up in Perth, Harry was an emerging talent with East Fife when he signed up as part of his national service to join the Black Watch. He soon found himself in the thick of the bloody, but often forgotten, Korean War where in the midst of conflict he suffered injuries from which it would take him over two years to recover.\nRemarkably, not only did he return to full health, he resumed his football career with gusto — signing for Rangers in 1956. He would enjoy a memorable eight-year spell with the Ibrox club, winning three league titles, two league cups and a Scottish Cup, as well as playing in the first Scottish side to reach a European final.\nA fearsome defender known as the “Iron Man”, he was never one to shirk a tackle on the pitch, and he’s not afraid to offer an opinion off it either — as he documents in a compelling autobiography which recently hit the bookshelves.\nHis is a tale far removed from the anodyne offerings served up by today’s breed of pampered millionaires. Having witnessed and experienced what he did on the battlefield, it’s hardly surprising that Davis had little time for those less appreciative of their sporting talents.\nTake, for example, the Rangers and Scotland great Jim Baxter.\n“I don’t dispute Baxter’s talent — he was a class player, but he wasted it,” he says ruefully. “He got privileges no one else got and it upset a lot of players in the team. He only turned it on once every three games and for the rest of the time, when your backs were to the wall, Baxter was nowhere to be seen.”\nHe describes Willie Waddell, the man who led Rangers to their only European trophy, as a “lucky manager” who had used his position as a sportswriter to undermine predecessor David White — a man Harry Davis had returned to Ibrox to assist.\n\nIT SEEMS CLEAR that wartime experience — and the discipline and work ethic it instilled — would leave a lasting imprint on everything Harry Davis did thereafter. But, ironically, his prowess on the football field might actually have spared him from active service altogether.\nHis military call came just after he had broken into East Fife’s excellent post-war team under Scott Symon — the man who would later bring him to Ibrox. And he adds: “I had a couple of opportunities, one to be a PTI in the army, and the other to take an airborne course.\n“It was all a scam to get you to play in the army team and I turned them all down. I was quite happy to go and thought it was all a bit of an adventure.”\nThat sense of wide-eyed wonder would soon give way to the full-blooded horrors of war, as he found himself fighting off Chinese forces intent on advancing further south on the Korean peninsula.\nHe remembers that many caught in the thick of the fighting were simple conscripts — scarcely prepared for the brutality they would encounter. Indelibly marked in his memory is the image of one desperate soldier running deliberately into enemy fire and to his death.\n“He was away with the birds,” he added. “I tried to stop him, but just at that moment a shell landed on top of our trench — all the hairs on the back of my hand were singed, but we were sheltered and escaped the full impact. But by the time I got up he was off again, and disappeared.\n“I couldn’t do anything about it, but that stayed with me. You can’t blame the guy — he was just a conscript as well.\n“There was always a little bit of ill feeling in that these conscripts were shipped out to the battlefield, yet regular, more experienced soldiers from the Black Watch were left behind in Germany.”\nHarry’s contribution to the war effort ended in the spring of 1953, though to this day he has no idea where the bullets which left him wounded actually came from. Years later, a former colleague contacted him to say he believed he had been responsible.\n“I said to him it might have been him, it might not have been. Who knows? But everyone was in a state of panic, and again we go back to conscripts. I certainly wouldn’t place any blame on him.”\nThe stray bullets had caught him on the back of the foot — fracturing his heel, but mercifully just missing the Achilles tendon. Having also suffered abdominal damage, Harry Davis would spend months recuperating in a Japanese hospital before returning to the UK to continue a slow road to recovery.\nIn the far east a nursing sister from Stornoway would become something of an inspiration, but it is Harry’s biggest regret that on leaving Japan he would never see the woman again.\n“She was marvellous and encouraged me so much through all the operations, the bad nights and bad days,” he added. “I made a point that I would go and see her, and when I built the hotel up here I thought I’d be able to find her. I only knew her as Sister MacKenzie, but she was from Stornoway and I believe she had something to do with the Post Office over there.\n“But then I did hear from one source that she had died — I never got to make contact with her. It’s one of the great disappointments of my lifetime.”\nON HARRY’S RETURN HOME doctors gave him little hope of ever playing top-level football again — sometimes in fairly graphic terms.\n“One doctor at the military hospital in London told me that my only hope was that my bowels were in such a state, defenders were likely to slip on what would come out! It didn’t look very encouraging.”\nYet after being helped back to fitness by David Kinnear — a physiotherapist and former Ibrox player — Harry Davis would eventually get his career back on track.\nHe resumed action for East Fife, and in 1956 got the call from Symon to follow him to Ibrox.\nIn Glasgow, he initially learned the ropes in the reserve side — one of his memorable early encounters bringing him into direct contact with the Celtic legend Charlie Tully, who by this time was at the opposite stage of his career.\nBefore too long Davis would join a first-team pool that included vintage names likes George Young, George Niven, Sammy Baird and Alex Scott, and Rangers lifted the league at the end of his first full season in 1957.\nIn something of a golden era for the Scottish game, Davis regularly played in front of crowds topping the 100,000 mark, and he remembers a vibrant and competitive league where in his first few years the main challenge came from a Hearts team which claimed two league titles.\n“If we had fewer than 40,000 at a game it was a disaster,” he said. “But regularly the crowds were 60-70,000 and for big games the 100,000-mark wasn’t unusual.”\nA degree of European success followed, as Rangers reached the European Cup Winners Cup Final in 1961. There they would be outclassed by a fine Fiorentina side, and tellingly Harry feels the Scots simply refused to heed their continental lesson. Half a century on, and the same basic mistakes continue to be made.\n“They were ahead of us,” he said. “Scott Symon was a great manager, no question, but he didn’t keep up with modern techniques. He still said get the ball to the winger, get the winger up the field and cross it and get the centre forward to head it into the net. That worked in the old days, but it didn’t work when you played these continental teams.”\nAfter winding down his playing career with a season at Partick Thistle, Harry took the manager’s job at the grand old institution of Queens Park. It was a time he enjoyed immensely, though the lure of Ibrox once again tempted him back across the city — this time to hook up with White.\nThat spell in the dugout was to prove less successful than his playing days, with Rangers then in the shadow of Jock Stein’s great Celtic side. Yet some redemption would arrive at Dundee where White and Davis led the Dens Park club to a memorable league cup final triumph over Celtic in 1973. A few months later the pair gained revenge over their old nemesis Waddell, dumping Rangers out of the Scottish Cup at Ibrox.\nDundee would prove to be Harry’s last staging post in football — and thereafter he set his sights on the quiet life in the north west Highlands.\nTHESE DAYS his football involvement is limited to appearing alongside former team-mates at charity fundraisers for the Erskine Trust, for which he is also to donate most of the proceeds from his book. However, he still keeps one eye on developments at Ibrox, even if he struggles to comprehend the team’s recent high-profile fall from grace.\n“The honest answer is that I just don’t know what to make of it all,” he said. “One conclusion is reached one week, and a week later it’s turned around again. But I do believe a number of teams were quite happy to get rid of them because they were strong competition. I don’t think that was right.”\nAsked for his personal highlights in the game, his answer is a simple one.  He just reels off a list of the players he played with, and it reads like a who’s who of greats for fans of the Ibrox club.\n“I joined Rangers and played with George Young, George Niven, Baird, Billy Simpson, Bobby Shearer, Alex Scott, Jim McColl — a great team. And then by the end I had also played with John Greig, Ronnie MacKinnon, Ian MacMillan, Millar, Brand, Baxter and Wilson. How many people can say that?”\nA Scotland cap may have proved elusive — “in those days they only picked 11” — with a place on the reserve list as close as he got to pulling on the dark blue.\nNevertheless, Harry Davis had long since proved his mettle on the international stage — and he still has the scars to prove it.\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/7s.jpg","title":"comhairle must replace barra housing","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\nComhairle nan Eilean Siar must replace land they gave away for housing in Castlebay, Barra, because it was meant to be kept in perpetuity for recreational use.\nLast month, Housing Minister Kevin Stewart cut the turf on the Corran Ciosmul development at Horve. However, the six houses are to be built on what was a King George V Playing Field, which was set aside and protected in 1962.\nFor anyone to build on this land they must notify and obtain the consent of Fields in Trust, a charity that acts to protect all KGV land. Even though the comhairle took over the management of the land in 1984 they must still obtain the trust’s consent.\nThe Barra Sports Forum have been pressing the comhairle for years to transfer a piece of derelict land near the Co-op, which is adjacent to the KGV area, for use as an all-weather pitch.\nA spokesman said: “The sports forum urge the comhairle to fulfil their legal and moral obligations to the people of Barra and Vatersay to protect the sports and recreation land in Horve by righting this wrong: firstly, by filing for a change of land use to Fields in Trust from ‘sports and recreation’ to ‘housing’ and secondly, by transferring an equivalent area of land to the KGV playing field in compensation for land lost to housing. Only by doing this will the comhairle avoid the danger of stalling the desperately needed new housing that helps secure the future of our islands.”\nRichard McKeever of Fields in Trust the charity recognised that that “sometimes it may be necessary” to change the use of recreational land.\nHe added: “As part of our protection, we have a responsibility to ensure the local owners and managers of these spaces seek our consent to undertake any changes regarding land ownership, land transactions, erection of buildings and structures \u0026#8211 and that proposed changes fit with the purpose of the protected space and benefit its recreational use. We are currently in constructive dialogue with the council and await their proposals for replacement recreational land of an equal or better standard which will be protected for the local community to enjoy in perpetuity.”\nThe housing development at Corran Ciosmul is being undertaken by the Hebridean Housing Partnership, which has owned the land since 2006.\nKatrina Rowlands, HHP development manager, said: “Due to the nature of how the titles were transferred to HHP, the burden in relation to the Fields in Trust was not recorded therefore the responsibility to meet the Fields in Trust conditions remains with the comhairle. We are aware that the comhairle’s legal team are in discussions with Fields In Trust to resolve the matter.”\nA spokesman for the comhairle said discussion with Fields in Trust were continuing.\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n"}]
