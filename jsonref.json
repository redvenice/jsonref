Comcast\u0027s was all cash while Disney\u0027s new offer of $38 per share is half cash and half stock.  Disney said on Wednesday it is raising its offer because Fox\u0027s value increased due to \u0027tax reform and operating improvements\u0027.\u0027After six months of integration planning we\u0027re even more enthusiastic and confident in the strategic fit of the assets and the talent at Fox,\u0027 said CEO Bob Iger in a statement.In a call with analysts, Iger said he believes Disney\u0027s bid is superior to Comcast\u0027s from a regulatory perspective, and said that six months of dealing with regulators both in the U.S. and internationally has given Disney a \u0027meaningful head start.\u0027Murdoch\u0027s £11.7billion bid to buy Sky is set to go ahead...AT\u0026T closes sale of Time Warner for $85 billion just two...Lurking Lauer: Disgraced NBC anchor hides his face under...Share this articleThe battle for Fox\u0027s entertainment business, which has produced hit films including Avatar and Ice Age, reflects a new imperative among traditional players in the industry to amass more programming to compete with Netflix and AmazonThe deal would include Fox film and TV studios, some cable networks and international assets, but not Fox News Channel or the Fox television network.Fox CEO Rupert Murdoch said the company \u0027firmly believes\u0027 that the combination with Disney is a good fit.\u0027We remain convinced that the combination of 21CF\u0027s iconic assets, brands and franchises with Disney\u0027s will create one of the greatest, most innovative companies in the world,\u0027 he said in a statement.But the New York company also said it is still weighing both offers, and noted that Disney\u0027s new bid doesn\u0027t have any provisions in it that prevents Fox from considering other offers.Fox and Disney shareholders had been scheduled to vote on Disney\u0027s original bid July 10, but that meeting has been postponed.In morning trading, shares of 21st Century Fox rallied 6 percent to $47.47.

Ms Ardern is set to make history as the first New Zealand Prime Minister to give birth while in the top seat          Following the birth, the government will be led by Winston Peters, 73, for six weeks. Ms Ardern (pictured at Polyfest in March) assured she would still be on call, and it would be business as usualDuring Ms Ardern\u0027s maternity leave, Mr Peters - the leader of the minority NZ First Party which forms part of New Zealand\u0027s coalition government - will have powers similar to those he would have if the prime minister was overseas.He will run the day-to-day operations in Wellington and will consult with Ms Ardern on \u0027significant political, strategic or public interest, or national security\u0027 matters.But he\u0027ll still be limited by the decisions of the Labour Party-dominated cabinet. Recent Newshub-Reid research polling found 39 per cent think Mr Peters will do a good job, the rest were either unsure or pessimistic.Often described as a populist, Mr Peters is the most experienced hand and one of the most iconic figures in the country\u0027s political landscape - but he is also polarising and has an often combative relationship with the media.He\u0027s formed coalition governments with both the centre-left and centre-right (playing the role of \u0027kingmaker\u0027 to leverage concessions out of the major parties), and since entering parliament in 1979 has held numerous senior cabinet posts, including deputy PM in the 1990s .          New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern (C) is the first PM to walk in the Pride Parade on February 17, 2018 in AucklandBut while he and Ms Ardern\u0027s Labour Party may not have seen eye-to-eye on some issues recently, they\u0027ve been talking up the trust between them.\u0027I\u0027ve almost found it surprising people have questioned that it will be anything other than business as usual for us,\u0027 Ms Ardern said.She became a mother just months after she took the country\u0027s top job in October.Ms Ardern announced she was pregnant in a Facebook post in January this year.          \u0027I\u0027ll be Prime Minister AND a mum, and Clarke will be \u0027first man of fishing\u0027 and stay-at-home dad,\u0027 she wrote on Facebook \u0027I\u0027ll be Prime Minister AND a mum, and Clarke will be \u0027first man of fishing\u0027 and stay-at-home dad,\u0027 she said at the time.\u0027I think it\u0027s fair to say that this will be a wee one that a village will raise but we couldn\u0027t be more excited.\u0027  "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/20/11/4D709A1A00000578-0-image-m-19_1529490856924.jpg","title":"Bridegroom denies boasting friends Ibiza holiday romances","story":"    Lucia Ghahramani, 31, has declared that she is standing by her fiance Jack Troutt and has blasted a holidaymaker who claimed online to have overheard the groom-to-be boasting of his sexual conquests while on his Ibiza holiday          Jack Troutt, 23, (pictured) claims a stranger\u0027s viral Facebook post that claimed he had cheated on his fiancée while on holiday in Ibiza has \u0027ruined his life\u0027          Steph Kendall\u0027s post quickly went viral and received more than 10,000 likes and more than 15,000 shares, with people eventually locating Jack onlineSpeaking to Mail Online, Lucia said: \u0027The wedding is definitely on.

My job is to represent my country, Ireland, and to do that as part of the European Union and we remain at the heart of the European Union.\u0027The most important aspect of the withdrawal agreement for us is the backstop, and Prime Minister May committed in March that there would be a backstop and outlined in December what that backstop would contain.\u0027Mr Juncker also made clear that a resolution to the border issue was crucial to the withdrawal treaty.\u0027This is not a bilateral question between Ireland the United Kingdom - this is an issue between the UK and the European Union,\u0027 he said.May hails \u0027crucial step\u0027 as flagship Brexit Bill is set to...Boris Johnson WILL miss crunch vote on expanding Heathrow by...\u0027Why don\u0027t you just let it fall down?\u0027 May suffers ANOTHER...NATO chief urges Trump, EU and Canada to put security first...Share this article\u0027We want to make it clear again and again that Ireland is not alone.\u0027We have Ireland backed by 26 member states and the Commission - this will not change.\u0027I am strongly against any temptation to isolate Ireland and not to conclude the deal on Ireland. Ireland has to be part of the deal.\u0027Earlier deputy Irish PM Simon Coveney indicated that a no-deal scenario was now being seriously contemplated within the EU.\u0027This is a question many people are asking,\u0027 he said.Mr Coveney said the EU was standing firmly behind Ireland and its demand for legally binding assurances from the UK to ensure no return to a hard border on the island.\u0027We have been reassured over and over again that Ireland will not be left isolated here,\u0027 he said.Mr Coveney added: \u0027Let\u0027s be very clear - there will be no withdrawal agreement, no transition agreement and no managed Brexit if the UK don\u0027t follow through on their commitments.\u0027Mr Juncker arrived in Dublin this morning for a two-day visit as the impasse between the EU and the UK over the border continues.Coming a week ahead of a crunch European Council meeting of leaders in Brussels, the visit is a clear demonstration of the EU\u0027s solidarity with Ireland\u0027s position.This week the EU warned that more work was needed on how to deal with the 300-mile border between Northern Ireland and the Republic, the UK\u0027s only land frontier with a European state, and protect frictionless movement after the withdrawal.    The visit by Mr Juncker (right) and Mr Barnier (left) comes just a week ahead of a crunch European Council meeting of leaders in BrusselsMr Juncker started his visit with a meeting with Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Mr Coveney at Government Buildings. He will later receive an honorary doctorate from the National University of Ireland and attend an official dinner hosted by Mr Varadkar in Dublin Castle.Later on Thursday morning he will address a joint sitting of both houses of the Irish parliament, the Oireachtas.On Friday, he will meet Irish President Michael D Higgins and visit the home of the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA), Croke Park, and the GAA museum.He will also watch a demonstration of Gaelic football and hurling."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/21/12/4D7B518B00000578-5869545-image-m-53_1529580361479.jpg","title":"Smack singer Akon set build CITY Senegal","story":"Singer Akon, pictured yesterday at the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity, plans to build a futuristic city in Senegal based around a crypto-currency called AKoin      Aid workers with Medecins Sans Frontieres regularly used...Boy, nine, died after being \u0027poisoned\u0027 on South Africa...Share this article    AKoin\u0027s website describes the proposed city as a \u0027master-planned city\u0027 with \u0027everything from residential to retail, parks, stadium, light manufacturing, universities, and schools\u0027 The star previously started the Lighting Africa project in an effort to provide solar energy to the continent. In 2016 he launched African music download service Musik Bi, with a mission to promote African artists.  In March this year Akon, who was born in St. Louis, Missouri, told TMZ that he could imagine running for President of the United States with Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg as his running mate. Paloma Faith and Naomi Campbell are also among the stars who have attended the Cannes Lions event in the south of France this year.  Akon to build new city in Senegal with own currency called AKoin"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/21/12/19EDD43C00000514-5869601-New_Zealand_Prime_Minister_Jacinda_Ardern_and_Clarke_Gayford_ann-a-11_1529580621341.jpg","title":"Who Jacinda Ardern New Zealand PM revealed giving birth office","story":"    Labour party leader Jacinda Ardern smiling as she is welcomed to her first caucus meetingWho is Jacinda Ardern?Born Jacinda Kate Laurell Ardern on July 26, 1980, in Hamilton, New Zealand, she is the country’s 40th and youngest ever Prime Minister.After graduating with a Bachelor of Communication Studies in politics and public relations from the University of Waikato, she was encouraged to embark on a career in politics by her aunt Marie Ardern, a long-standing member of the Labour Party.Jacinda then spent time in the offices of the current Mayor of Auckland Peter Goff and former Prime Minister Helen Clark as a researcher before becoming a senior figure in Young Labour. She spent time in New York before working as a senior policy adviser for Tony Blair’s government.During her time as a member of the Labour Party, Ardern has been a strong advocate for children, women and the right to have meaning work for every New Zealander.After becoming the MP for the Auckland electorate Mount Albert in 2017 and Leader of the Labour Party in the same year, she was elected PM on October 19 after First Leader Winston Peters announced a coalition. #JacindaMania ensued.Jacinda became New Zealand’s third Prime Minister after Jenny Shipley (1997-1999) and Helen Clark (1999-2008). Months later, she announced that she was pregnant and Winston Peters would take on the role of Acting Prime Minister for six weeks after the birth.      In a statement, the New Zealand Prime Minister added: \u0027I\u0027m sure we\u0027re going through all of the emotions new parents go through, but at the same time feeling so grateful for all the kindness and best wishes from so many people.’Ahead of her leave, PM Ardern had been vocal about her six week departure and said ‘The thing to keep in mind is: I’m not dead.’However, Winston Peters has been causing a stir since the day that she left Wellington and lodged a privacy breach lawsuit against a government department, scuttled a major piece of Labour policy and attacked the leadership of New Zealand’s largest company.Although some believe that the deputy will do a good job, others are pessimistic due to the minister often being described as a populist. However, Peters has been hailed a ‘kingmaker’ after forming the coalition government and merging the centre-left and centre-right political parties.      ‘For young women, the example Ardern is setting is an affirmation that they too can expect to have that choice. For young men, Gayford being the full time carer of a baby sends a powerful message that they too can exercise that choice.‘New Zealand is known for being, by and large, a socially progressive country. Ardern is its third female prime minister it has had three female governors general and women have held significant positions across the public and private spheres. 125 years ago, it became the first country where women won the right to vote.‘Now it is breaking new ground with a prime minister giving birth and her partner becoming a stay-at-home father. But in the context of New Zealand, this is evolutionary, not revolutionary. Overwhelmingly positive interest across the political spectrum is being taken in the addition to the first family.‘What lessons are there in this for our world? In my view, New Zealand is showing that no doors are closed to women, that having a baby while being prime minister can be managed, and that it’s acceptable for male partners to be full-time carers. This is very positive role modelling for the empowerment of women and for gender equality.’AMC movie subscription launched to rival MoviePassFortnite Season 4 Week 8 challenges: What they are and how to solve themWho is Dedrick Williams?

Experienced festival-goers ensured that they were prepared for any weather, donning their wellies on the campsite           Two other revellers were seen arriving in their stylish festival looks and wellies this afternoon  This year\u0027s Isle of Wight marks 50 years since the popular music event was originally founded          Festival-goers faced long queues as they arrived at the campsite on the first day of the festival           Isle of Wight Festival organisers apologised to revellers for the delays in clearing security However, the music event was forced to stop after the local council passed a law banning any open air festival of more than 5,000 without a special license.  The modern Isle of Wight Festival was revived in 2002 by John Giddings, and has taken place annually since then.            Happy campers!

The \u0027majority\u0027 did so unaccompanied, but it is unclear how many were taken from their parents          Artwork: The First Lady, making her first solo trip outside Washington D.C. since she had kidney surgery, looked at art on the walls of the children\u0027s shelter in McAllen, Texas, where children are being held after crossing the border          Inside the facility: The First Lady was shown how the children are cared for, including decorations showing the pilgrims arriving on the Mayflower. It was unclear if these had been made by the children          Austere: This is one of the bedrooms where children are held in the facility visited by the First Lady.           Visit: Melania Trump made an unexpected trip to Upbring New Hope Children\u0027s Shelter, where 55 children are currently being held          Concern: The First Lady said she was at the shelter to say \u0027thank you for your hard work, your compassion, your kindness in these hard times\u0027          Melania Trump arrived in Texas to visit children at a \u0027tender age\u0027 shelter where children including some separated from their families at the border are being held          Surprise: The visit was not disclosed in advance but comes after the First Lady pressured her husband to end the policy of forced separations The first lady said she was happy to be visiting the kids. \u0027I\u0027m looking forward to meeting the children,\u0027 she said during her visit to the Upbring New Hope Children\u0027s Shelter, a facility that is sheltering 55 children - 27 boys, 28 girls who range from ages from 12 to 17, most of whom are from Guatemala. And all but six were unaccompanied minors, with the rest having been separated.And while Melania Trump was making her visit, at exactly the same time, President Trump claimed there was a \u0027massive child smuggling industry\u0027 at the border. He spoke at length before a cabinet meeting, claiming that there was a \u0027massive child smuggling industry\u0027.\u0027People are suffering because of the Democrats. They created, and they have let it happen, a massive child smuggling industry,\u0027 he said. \u0027The human traffickers are making a fortune. It\u0027s a disgrace.\u0027His comments come after he had to execute a u-turn on child separations which had exploded because of a new zero-tolerance policy for people crossing the border illegally, with Border Patrol ordered to arrest and prosecute every person caught crossing illegally.The Texas briefing was a rare opportunity to hear the first lady speak. She is mostly seen and not heard when at public appearances with her husband. She did not ask questions when she joined her husband two weeks ago at a hurricane preparedness briefing at FEMA.But the solo trip gave her a chance to address officials in Texas. \u0027Thank you for all you do,\u0027 she told officials as she started the meeting.She spoke softly and in a slightly accented voice. \u0027Thank you so much for having me today. I\u0027m glad I\u0027m here and looking forward to meeting the children,\u0027 she said.\u0027I\u0027d also like to ask you how I can help reunite these children with their families as quickly as possible,\u0027 she added. Her first question was: \u0027How often do the children get to call and talk to their families?\u0027 She also asked officials what kind of shape the children are in when they arrive. \u0027I\u0027ve heard they are very happy. They love to study. They love school,\u0027 the First Lady said.Additionally, she wanted to know how long the children stayed at the center and if they were without the parents.Officials told her the majority of the children had arrived unaccompanied - meaning it is unclear how many were victims of family separation.           First lady Melania Trump greets boarder patrol agents before boarding a plane at McAllen Miller International Airport          SMILE!

There was laughter and lots of smiles, including three girls in the back row, hairs in buns, who were smiling a lot. A boy in the front row had a Spanish-English dictionary in front of him. Many of the kids wore gray T-shirts that said \u0027We Are One\u0027 with we in red, are in white and one in blue.Mrs. Trump asked inidually where they were from, how long they\u0027d been there. She spoke in English. Some responded in English. Others, the teacher translated for Mrs. Trump. As she left she said, \u0027Be kind and nice to other, ok? Nice to meet you.\u0027 And then she helped them resume their counting exercise they\u0027d been doing before she got there, chanting \u002762, 63, 64, 65.\u0027In the next classroom, the children were learning about angles and lines. The teacher explained a contest to build model bridges to Mrs. Trump. Kids worked in groups of four and whichever bridge held the most weight wins.\u0027Bubye. Good luck,\u0027 the first lady said. The kids applauded as she left. In the third classroom, a poster of U.S. presidents that went through George W. Bush was on the wall to the right of the door. A hand painted U.S. flag covered the white wipe board. It read \u0027Welcome! First lady.\u0027There were 12 kids in this room and all were girls. Mrs. Trump asked where they were from. One said she\u0027d been here for two months. Another told her they were learning how to celebrate the Fourth of July.They each signed to flag to give to her. Aides began to roll it up but the plan changed. Melania Trump signed it herself before leaving, to leave behind as a gift.She also asked what kinds of music they like.\u0027They like to dance a lot,\u0027 the teacher said. Mrs. Trump asked for a demonstration but then laughed. \u0027This is a serious class.... so study hard\u0027 and be kind to each other, she told them and added that friendship  \u0027is very important.\u0027She then moved to the nurses office for a briefing on medical care. Grisham said the first lady wanted see the facilities for herself and to thank the staff working in them.\u0027Her goals are to thank law enforcement and social services providers for their hard work, lend support and hear more on how the administration can build upon the already existing efforts to reunite children with their families,\u0027 Grisham said.Her visit comes amid a political firestorm for the Trump administration. President Donald Trump took heavy criticism from both sides of the aisle, former presidents and his own wife about the \u0027zero tolerance\u0027 immigration policy that resulted in migrant children being separated from their families at the border.Melania Trump issued a rare public statement on the issue over the weekend, inserting herself into a policy issue that she had previously been silent upon.Her next visit was scheduled to be the Ursula Border Patrol Processing Center, a Customs and Border PatrolDepartment of Homeland Security intake center where migrant families spend a few days.But that was canceled due to flooding.Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar traveled with her.Her spokesperson said the First Lady will continue to be a vocal presence on the issue as administration officials try to work out ways to reunited children and their families after President Trump signed an executive order on Wednesday.\u0027While we\u0027re going through that process she\u0027s going to lend her support and promote family reunification and I\u0027m sure she\u0027ll continue to give her husband opinions on what she\u0027s thinking along the way,\u0027 Grisham said of the visit.Trump in fresh broadside on immigration as he claims...Texas migrant detention center scrambles to source 5,100...Share this article    Dress down: The First Lady flew to McAllen, Texas, dressed in Adidas Sam Smith shoes, white pants, a creme button down safari shirt and a green jacket          Sober trip: Melania Trump said she was in Texas to thank social workers and law enforcement for their work \u0027in these hard times\u0027          Wet arrival: The First lady arrived at McAllen airport on a government jet in heavy rain for her visit to a children\u0027s shelter and a border processing center          Husband\u0027s blessing: Donald Trump, who held a cabinet meeting in the White House while his wife toured the facility, supported her visit, the First Lady\u0027s spokeswoman said          Frenzy on the border: At the same time as the First Lady was in McAllen, Democratic mayors and activists were holding a rally at the Tornillo port of entry near El Paso, protesting family separations          On the border: Melania Trump visits the Upbring New Hope Children Center, run by the Lutheran Social Services of the South, in McAllen, Texas, an unexpected visit the day after her husband ended the policy of family separation at the border          here to see what\u0027s happening: The First Lady\u0027s spokeswoman said Melania wants to see children reunited with their families. \u0027She\u0027ll do everything she can and she\u0027ll speak her opinions as much as she can.\u0027Grisham emphasized how much the first lady wants to see children reunited with their families.\u0027She\u0027ll do everything she can and she\u0027ll speak her opinions as much as she can.\u0027 Helping children is slowly becoming the first lady\u0027s signature issue. When she announced her policy agenda four days before she had a kidney procedure, she called it \u0027Be Best\u0027 and said she would help children become the best they can be.She appears most comfortable when she is with children. Often bending down to speak with them and smiling broadly at them and their questions.The visit also marks a rare solo public trip for Melania Trump, who eased into her role as first lady and then disappeared from the public eye for 25 days in May after she under went a kidney operation.And her comes after President Donald Trump credited her and daughter Ivanka for helping change his mind about separating children from their families.President Trump, when he signed his executive order on the issue on Wednesday, indicated that lobbying from Ivanka, who showed him pictures of the caged and kenneled children, and wife Melania had caused him to have a change in heart.\u0027Ivanka feels very strongly about it. My wife feels very strongly about it. I feel very strongly about it. I think anybody with a heart would feel very strongly about it,\u0027 he said.The first lady also saw the photos from the border and heard the recordings of children being separated from their families.\u0027She\u0027s seen the images. She\u0027s heard the recordings,\u0027 Grisham said. \u0027She was on top of the situation before any of that came out. She was concerned about it.\u0027Grisham said Mrs. Trump saw the images of kids behind chain link fence at an intake facility.\u0027The images struck her, as a mother, as a human being.\u0027Melania Trump asked her staff on Tuesday to plan a trip as soon as possible – before President Trump signed the executive order and Grisham said she wasn\u0027t sure if Mrs. Trump knew that the order was coming.          Mobile: The First Lady\u0027s rare solo trip outside Washington D.C. to a children\u0027s center where she looked at artworks made by detained children came after her husband entered a political firestorm over illegal immigrant families being separated  Public expression: The First Lady\u0027s involvement in the border separation crisis marks a new phase in her public profile\u0027I don\u0027t know what she knew. She knew what she wanted to do and she told us,\u0027 Grisham said.\u0027She wanted to see everything for herself…. She supports family reunification. She thinks that it\u0027s important that children stay with their families.\u0027\u0027This was 100 percent her idea. She absolutely wanted to come.\u0027And it was her idea to visit before her husband signed his executive order, Grisham said, and she had no second thoughts after the order was signed.\u0027She wants to see what\u0027s happening for herself and she wants to lend her support, executive order or not. The executive order certainly is helping pave the way a little bit, but there\u0027s still a lot to be done.\u0027President Trump supported this trip but he didn\u0027t send her.\u0027This was her decision. She told her staff she wanted to go and we made that happen. He is supportive of it but she told him, \u0027I\u0027m headed down to Texas,\u0027 and he supported it.\u0027\u0027She wants to see these children and she wants to help children. It\u0027s not about anything more than that…. She wants to see what\u0027s real. She wants to see a realistic view.\u0027The immigration debate is a rare public policy issue that Melania Trump has inserted herself into.The first lady issued a rare public statement on Sunday about her husband\u0027s \u0027zero tolerance\u0027 policy.It appeared to break with the Trump administration\u0027s stance.Grisham said in a statement  that \u0027Mrs. Trump hates to see children separated from their families and hopes both sides of the aisle can finally come together to achieve successful immigration reform\u0027.\u0027She believes we need to be a country that follows all laws, but also a country that governs with heart.\u0027Melania Trump is an immigration herself. She was born in Yugoslavia, what is now Slovenia and came to New York City in 1996. She became a permanent resident of the U.S. in 2001 and became a citizen in 2006.She is the first naturalized U.S. citizen to become First Lady of the United States. Asked if her immigration background influenced Mrs. Trump\u0027s views, Grisham said she didn\u0027t know.\u0027I don\u0027t know that it plays into her thinking but I can tell you guys that when she came into this country she did it legally and she feels that everybody should enter the country legally,\u0027 she said."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/21/21/4D79B0A600000578-0-image-m-64_1529614685017.jpg","title":"Amazing cat uses toilet like human just like Meet Parents","story":"    Meggie the Maine Coon was caught using the toilet just like a human by her shocked ownerRemarkably, the feline taught herself how to use the toilet - much to the surprise of her owner Lily. She said: \u0027We have recently heard running water when we knew no one else was in the house.South Africa\u0027s dumbest tourist strokes a LION... and barely...Share this article\u0027We didn’t think much of it, but then we started noticing that Meggie would walk out of the bathroom that we heard the noises in, and didn’t believe it could actually be her. \u0027We finally caught her in the act.

It’s far too distracting for children having mobile phones. \u0027Texting, sexting, all this takes place. Mobile phones go off in classrooms, disrupting lessons. Ban them.‘If children want to use a phone in an emergency they can use the school phone.’          If implemented, the ban would mean punishments for pupils who disobey - and in extreme instances could even result in court action against parentsIn France, the government has said inidual schools should decide how they will enforce the ban.It has been suggested that pupils could hand in their phones at the start of each school day and receive them back at the end of the day.This would mean children could still have their devices during the journeys to and from school, which they may need for safety reasons.Current Ofsted boss Amanda Spielman is also throwing her weight behind school leaders who ban the devices, telling the Festival that the place of smartphones in the classroom is ‘dubious at best’.          Sir Michael is the first to suggest that a ban on mobile phones in schools should be enshrined in lawHowever, Sir Michael is the first to suggest that a ban on mobile phones in schools should be enshrined in law.During his wide-ranging discussion, Mr Wilshaw also angering teachers by saying there are some who ‘knock off at 3.30’ and are ‘lazy’.‘There is an education establishment out there that doesn’t like change, doesn’t like people like me saying “you’ve got some people in your own profession who are lazy and feckless and you need to get rid of them”,’ he said.‘They don’t like that. There is an education establishment that doesn’t like change and reform.’Sir Michael suggested that the teaching profession can be ‘defensive’ and would say that all teachers are hard-working and professional.‘They’re not,’ he said.‘I’ve been teaching for 43 years, head teacher for over 30.

Bailiffs cleared the hallway after the appearance for the privacy of the children who could be seen from a distance in silhouette as they were ushered out of view.Disturbing details emerged during Wednesday\u0027s preliminary hearing in the Turpin case, including how the victims were fed moldy pies, whipped with belts and choked for watching a Justin Bieber music video.Those present in Superior Court in Riverside gasped when prosecutors showed photos of two of Louise and David Turpin\u0027s daughters that their 17-year-old sister had snapped with an old cellphone before fleeing in January.The images featured two pale, malnourished girls, ages 11 and 14, shackled to bunk beds inside their family\u0027s filthy home in Perris, California. David and Louise have pleaded not guilty to torture, child abuse and other charges. Each is being held on $12million bail and could face up to life in prison if convicted.The couple was arrested in January after their 17-year-old daughter, who had spent two years planning an escape, climbed out a window and then called 911 to report abuse. By the time police arrived at the house 70 miles southeast of Los Angeles, the two shackled sisters had been hastily released from their chains when police showed up, but a 22-year-old son remained restrained.The young man said he and his siblings had been suspected of stealing food and being disrespectful, Riverside County sheriff\u0027s Det. Thomas Salisbury said during Wednesday\u0027s hearing. The man said he had been tied up with ropes at first but later, after learning to wriggle free, restrained with increasingly larger chains on and off over six years. Sheriff\u0027s deputy Daniel Brown said one daughter told him that she knew her sister had contacted police when she heard a knock at the door and saw flashing lights outside the window.\u0027She said she was finally going to become free,\u0027 Brown said.Senior investigators with the county district attorney\u0027s office testified that doctors and medical records showed some of the children were severely malnourished and had muscle wasting, with some adult children being 32lbs underweight.          Investigators testified that one of the Turpins\u0027 daughters (pictured), aged 11, had the arms the size of an infant The 11-year-old girl who had been shackled to her bed had stunted growth from malnourishment and her arms were the size of an infant\u0027s, investigator Patrick Morris said.In her 20-minute 911 call, the 17-year-old who escaped told the dispatcher: \u0027We don\u0027t really do school. I haven\u0027t finished first grade.\u0027The girl told sheriff\u0027s Deputy Manuel Campos that she hadn\u0027t bathed in a year and that she didn\u0027t know the date or the month, he testified.About two years ago, the mother found out the girl had been watching a Justin Bieber video on a cellphone borrowed from her sister, and started choking her and asked, \u0027do you want to die?\u0027 Campos said.The girl said she didn\u0027t want to die, but she feared she was about to as the choking continued.\u0027Yes you do, yes you do, you do, you want to die,\u0027 the mother said, according to Campos. \u0027You want to die and go to hell.\u0027 There was no breakfast, and recently lunch and dinner had been combined into one meal that included peanut butter and bologna sandwiches, a frozen burrito and chips.The girl said she recently had started refusing the peanut butter sandwiches \u0027because she starts to gag and starts to throw up,\u0027 Campos testified.The teen, who said she hadn’t finished first grade, had difficulty pronouncing some words and spoke like a much younger child.The girl planned her escape for two years and was terrified as she climbed out a window to freedom, according to Campos\u0027 testimony.\u0027She couldn’t even dial 911 because she was so scared that she was shaking,\u0027 he said.She didn’t know the neighborhood and had to read her address to the dispatcher off a piece of paper. The kids were rarely allowed outside, though they went out on Halloween and traveled as a family to Disneyland and Las Vegas, they said.\u0027Sometimes I wake up and I can’t breathe because of how dirty the house is,\u0027 the girl told the woman dispatcher.She said she hadn’t bathed in a year and Campos observed dirt caked on her skin and a stink from being unbathed.           Louise was seen wiping her eyes (not pictured) while listening to a 911 call her 17-year-old daughter  made after escaping their Perris, California, home in January  Claws: Both the husband and wife appeared in court on Wednesday with exceedingly long fingernails (left and right)          What\u0027s so funny?

She said she didn’t like it and pulled up her pants, and that he told her not tell anyone, Campos said.The children spent most of their time locked in their rooms except for limited meals or using the bathroom.If they didn’t obey strict rules, they were slapped in the face or had their hair pulled, the girl told CamposThe eldest son in the family told authorities discipline in the home included beatings with the leather or buckle end of a belt, said Wade Walsvick, senior investigator for the Riverside County district attorney’s office. Years earlier, when the family lived in Texas, he said the beatings involved \u0027a switch, the paddle and the oar\u0027 and the siblings were sometimes placed in cages.Wednesday\u0027s hearing was held to determine whether the prosecutors have amassed enough evidence to take the case against the Turpins to trial. Authorities said the Turpin children were isolated from each other and locked in different rooms in small groups. They did not have access to televisions or radios but expressed themselves in the hundreds of journals that investigators seized from the home.          Authorities said the Turpin home in Perris (pictured) reeked of human waste, and the evidence of their children\u0027s starvation was obviousMost of the  children were homeschooled, but one of the older boys was allowed to attend classes at Mt San Jacinto Community College.His mother would drive him there, stay outside in the hallway during the class and then take him back home as soon as the class ended, prosecutors said.After they were freed from the home, the children, who ranged in age from 2 to 29, were immediately hospitalized and eventually released. Prosecutors said the abuse was so prolonged the children\u0027s growth was stunted.The current whereabouts of the children is unknown. A spokeswoman for the county\u0027s social services department declined to discuss the case.Jack Osborn, an attorney appointed to represent the couple\u0027s seven adult children, said earlier this year they were \u0027doing well.\u0027           After they were freed from the home, the children, who ranged in age from 2 to 29 (pictured at their parents\u0027 vow renewal ceremony), were immediately hospitalizedThey have participated in music therapy programs, made crafts and world-famous cellist Yo-Yo Ma held a special concert for them.

They do not want people to think of them only as a possible victim, but as young adults setting off on their lives,\u0027 he told the Riverside Press-Enterprise newspaper in February.The hearing is scheduled to resume Thursday. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/21/01/05438E7B000003E8-0-image-m-20_1529542733772.jpg","title":"ROSS CLARK did nightmare happen","story":"    Pub chain Wetherspoon warned yesterday that it is likely to run out of popular brands of beer over the next few days. File photoBut the invisible, odourless gas, which we produce every time we breathe, is also essential for other everyday products.Many abattoirs use it to stun pigs and chickens prior to slaughter. The animals are put into a chamber where concentrations build up slowly, depriving them of oxygen.Because of its inert qualities, the gas is also used in meat packaging, preventing the growth of micro-organisms which depend on oxygen, and prolonging the freshness of packaged meat.Its use explains why the shortage of the gas is causing such alarm in the meat industry, with chicken-producing plants warning of imminent shortages in supermarkets and one major plant said to have only enough CO2 for one more day\u0027s production. The British Poultry Council is warning that without fresh supplies of CO2 to Britain, where some 2.2 million chickens are consumed daily, 60 per cent of chicken production will have to be suspended in days.No chicken tonight: After fizzy drinks and beer now Britain...Pubs could run dry of beer and fizzy drinks as Britain is...Share this articleBut a shortage of CO2 gas will also affect a wide variety of foods, from cooked and fresh meat and ready meals through to pre-packaged salads, the British Meat Processors Association warns.Carbon dioxide is widely used in the fruit and vegetable industry to keep food fresh while it is being stored and transported.As they ripen, fruit and vegetables take in oxygen and \u0027breathe\u0027 out carbon dioxode. By flooding the sheds they are stored in with CO2, the amount of oxygen is reduced which means they take less in, and ripening is put on hold. The gas also helps lessen the damage caused by chilling during transport while moulds and insects are killed.          Many mass-produced beers undergo \u0027forced\u0027 carbonisation, in which the gas is pumped in to produce its fizz. The same happens with carbonated soft drinks. File photoBut although the most immediate impact of this shortage will be felt in the food and drink industries, CO2 is a crucial compound in manufacturing as well. Fire extinguishers contain frozen carbon dioxide because it smothers fires and won\u0027t burn.It\u0027s used to make plastics, in water treatment plants, in the assembly of electronic circuit boards, in the oil industry, in the manufacture of chemicals... in fact, it has an extraordinary number of applications.Which makes it all the more staggering that we are running short of CO2, which forms 0.04 per cent of the atmosphere by volume, too small to make extraction commercially viable. So how did this crisis come about?The reason is that the bulk of the CO2 used commercially is a by-product from ammonia production. If ammonia plants did not sell the gas, they would have to find some way of disposing it.It makes sense, therefore, for beer and food and other industries to source most of their carbon dioxide from ammonia plants – with smaller quantities coming from the production of bio-ethanol, a \u0027green\u0027 fuel made from crops. The trouble is that ammonia plants often shut for maintenance during the summer. The main use for ammonia is to make agricultural fertilisers, and demand from farmers is at its lowest at this time of year as crops are by now well established.Summer also happens to be when the production of beer and soft drinks peaks so there is often some kind of supply crunch around June.          The British Poultry Council is warning that without fresh supplies of CO2 to Britain, 60 per cent of chicken production will have to be suspended in days. File photoThe problem has been compounded by a fall in global ammonia prices. The British fertiliser industry is finding it cheaper to source ammonia from abroad so some UK production has been put on hold.At present, only one large plant in Britain is believed to be producing ammonia and, therefore, carbon dioxide. The shortage exposes just how vulnerable UK manufacturing is to the availability of raw materials.We think of manufacturing as being a global industry. Yet when it comes to hard-to-transport goods such as CO2, industry is still heavily reliant on local sources.The same is true of beer. A remarkable number of them are brewed in Britain. Who would have guessed that when you swig a can of \u0027Danish\u0027 Carlsberg you are drinking a product brewed in Northampton?Just as most European countries had far better gas storage facilities than Britain to cope with the Beast from the East, so too are they better protected against the shortage of CO2. With a less-depleted industrial base, they have access to more plants supplying the gas.All of which points to the folly of letting our nation become dependent on foreign supplies of important goods such as CO2. And which means that if Harry Kane does end up lifting the World Cup, we might have to celebrate with water or good old-fashioned bitter, which isn\u0027t made with CO2.While the Germans drown their sorrows with lager, full of fizz made with their own carbon dioxide which won\u0027t have run out. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/21/01/05438E7B000003E8-0-image-m-20_1529542733772.jpg","title":"Englands nearly lager fizzy drinks","story":"    Football fans face some rather flat World Cup celebrations as beer taps could be turned off within days.

Pictured, England fans in Russia on June 18The problem is understood to stem from a longer than usual break in production of ammonia, one of the key sources of food grade CO2 in Europe.A large number of plants that handle ammonia have been shut for longer than expected because of maintenance.

Yesterday former Labour South East director Michael Creighton, 66, said Mrs Formby was a member of Militant in Southampton in the 1980s.The Southampton Labour Party member said her membership was common knowledge in the branch.Speaking from his home in the city, he said: ‘Militant never published a membership list, but it was common knowledge at the time among Labour Party members in Southampton that Jennie was a member.‘Everyone was saying it, we had about 500 members in Labour Southampton. Everyone just knew because there were other Militant members and you knew who they were –there are things you just know.‘She was Left-wing, so are lots of people, but not all of them are members of the Militant Tendency.‘It did concern us when people were members of Militant, that’s why Labour kicked them out.’Emily Thornberry brands Donald Trump a \u0027bully\u0027 as she...David Lammy MP grapples with reporter and storms out of...Share this articleHe added about 20 per cent of party members in Southampton were in Militant but noted Mrs Formby survived the purge.Mr Creighton said: ‘When there were half-a-dozen or so Militant members kicked out by the party nationally, it really drew a line under it and she remained a Labour Party member.’Channel 4 News journalist Michael Crick, author of a book on Militant, first made the claim. Labour declined to comment on the allegation but did not deny that Mrs Formby was once part of the movement.

It lives a zigzag white mark on its leaves (pictured) and has now been found in the UK Elm leaf-feeding insects such as the rare white-letter hairstreak butterfly, which suffered in the 1970s due to the loss of trees to Dutch elm disease, could be hit by the new pest\u0027s arrival.While the zigzag elm sawfly rarely kills trees, large populations can completely defoliate elms, which could be disastrous for the white-letter hairstreak whose populations are sometimes restricted to single trees, the experts said.The first evidence of the pest in Britain was a chance discovery, according to scientists at RBGE.RBGE mycologist Dr Katherine Hayden said: \u0027Plant samples arrived here to be identified as part of local plant recording activity carried out by experienced amateurs in Surrey.Farewell Koko, the gorilla who proved animals CAN talk to us...Thousands pack Stonehenge to witness sunrise on the summer...Share this article\u0027Examination by our elm specialist revealed the curious zigzag feeding damage as the first evidence of the pest in Britain.\u0027RBGE science communicator Max Coleman said: \u0027The zigzag elm sawfly can quickly build up pest populations as females are able to reproduce asexually.\u0027People will be familiar with how fast greenfly can spread. The sawfly has evolved the same strategy: exploit the speed advantage of asexual reproduction and avoid the risk of not finding a mate.\u0027Scientists are now asking people to report sightings of the unmistakable zigzag pattern, to track the sawfly\u0027s spread and help scientists secure definitive evidence of its presence in the form of adult insects, larvae or pupae.It has also prompted renewed calls for action to protect the UK\u0027s woodlands and wildlife.          The discovery has raised concerns it could pose another blow to the UK\u0027s elms, which have already been devastated by Dutch elm disease, and threaten wildlife that rely on the treesDr Nick Atkinson, senior conservation advisor for the Woodland Trust, said: \u0027This could be another blow to the elm population, following the widespread devastation caused by Dutch elm disease, which began in the 1970s and continues even today.\u0027By continuing to allow the import of trees and other living materials we are risking the health of our natural landscapes and our own well-being as a consequence.\u0027Action is needed now. Government, with buy-in from the forestry and horticulture sectors, and even supermarkets that sell plants, need to help minimise further risks to our native trees and woodlands.\u0027The zigzag elm sawfly rarely kills elm trees alone but rids them of their leaves, which are needed for photosynthesis.This makes them far more vulnerable to being killed by other problems such as Dutch elm disease, which still exists in Britain. Because of Dutch elm disease, many of the surviving elm trees in Britain are young, which puts them at greater risk from the sawfly.At the last count in the 1990s, there were estimated to be roughly five million elm trees in Britain."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/18/23/4D5A4E0300000578-0-David_Dimbleby_is_the_face_of_Question_Time_where_he_has_spent_o-m-3_1529359746420.jpg","title":"Its time woman helm Question Time says Culture Secretary","story":"    David Dimbleby, 79, first presented Question Time on January 14, 1994, and is the longest serving presenter of the show‘And does he agree with me that in this year – 100 years of women’s suffrage – this baton should be passed to a woman?’Mr Hancock replied: ‘I think the whole House will want to congratulate David Dimbleby on his achievement.\u0027And while, of course, the job must go according to merit, I think it’s about time we had a woman at the helm of Question Time.’QUENTIN LETTS: How I’ll miss the Dimbleby gravitas that...Samira Ahmed throws her hat into the ring to be new Question...Share this articleDimbleby, 79, first presented Question Time on January 14, 1994, and is the longest serving presenter of the show.He has missed only one episode of the show, when he was admitted to hospital after being kicked by a cow at his Sussex home in 2009.           Mishal Husain (left) and Emily Maitlis (right) are among the women who have been named as potential candidates to take over from Question Time titan Dimbleby (centre), who has hosted the show for a quarter of a centuryHe said earlier this week: ‘At the end of the year I will have been chairing Question Time for a quarter of a century and I have decided that this is the right moment to leave.\u0027His final broadcast will be on December 13.

That could help them estimate where the corners of the stage were 49 years ago.During the dig, archaeologists rolled back meter squares of the long green grass and carefully scraped away inches of dirt as they searched for clues about the long-ago layout.\u0027It\u0027s some science. It\u0027s some guesswork,\u0027 said archaeologist Paul Brown as he worked a square. \u0027You hope that you get lucky.\u0027What artifacts they did find along the way will be analyzed and mapped for depth and location. Anderson said obsolete artifacts like the pull tab parts are useful since they suggest where the surface level was at the time of the concert.Lawrence said the archaeologists\u0027 report also will be used as museum officials consider restoring the grades in the area of the original stage. The museum is weighing any change to the site carefully, given its significance to so many.A stream of visitors on a recent sunny day visited the corner of the field with a big metal plaque commemorating the concert. Some made peace signs as they smiled for pictures, others paused quietly to gaze at the grassy expanse.\u0027There\u0027s just something about this place that - and I\u0027m not the only one - that draws people here,\u0027 67-year-old Woodstock veteran Charles Maloney said as he stood by the plaque. \u0027I mean, this area here could have 200 people.

Ms Ardern is set to make history as the first New Zealand Prime Minister to give birth while in the top seat          Following the birth, the government will be led by Winston Peters, 73, for six weeks.

It was unclear if these had been made by the children          Austere: This is one of the bedrooms where children are held in the facility visited by the First Lady.           Visit: Melania Trump made an unexpected trip to Upbring New Hope Children\u0027s Shelter, where 55 children are currently being held          Concern: The First Lady said she was at the shelter to say \u0027thank you for your hard work, your compassion, your kindness in these hard times\u0027          Melania Trump arrived in Texas to visit children at a \u0027tender age\u0027 shelter where children including some separated from their families at the border are being held          Surprise: The visit was not disclosed in advance but comes after the First Lady pressured her husband to end the policy of forced separations The first lady said she was happy to be visiting the kids. \u0027I\u0027m looking forward to meeting the children,\u0027 she said during her visit to the Upbring New Hope Children\u0027s Shelter, a facility that is sheltering 55 children - 27 boys, 28 girls who range from ages from 12 to 17, most of whom are from Guatemala. And all but six were unaccompanied minors, with the rest having been separated.And while Melania Trump was making her visit, at exactly the same time, President Trump claimed there was a \u0027massive child smuggling industry\u0027 at the border. He spoke at length before a cabinet meeting, claiming that there was a \u0027massive child smuggling industry\u0027.\u0027People are suffering because of the Democrats. They created, and they have let it happen, a massive child smuggling industry,\u0027 he said. \u0027The human traffickers are making a fortune. It\u0027s a disgrace.\u0027His comments come after he had to execute a u-turn on child separations which had exploded because of a new zero-tolerance policy for people crossing the border illegally, with Border Patrol ordered to arrest and prosecute every person caught crossing illegally.The Texas briefing was a rare opportunity to hear the first lady speak. She is mostly seen and not heard when at public appearances with her husband. She did not ask questions when she joined her husband two weeks ago at a hurricane preparedness briefing at FEMA.But the solo trip gave her a chance to address officials in Texas. \u0027Thank you for all you do,\u0027 she told officials as she started the meeting.She spoke softly and in a slightly accented voice. \u0027Thank you so much for having me today. I\u0027m glad I\u0027m here and looking forward to meeting the children,\u0027 she said.\u0027I\u0027d also like to ask you how I can help reunite these children with their families as quickly as possible,\u0027 she added. Her first question was: \u0027How often do the children get to call and talk to their families?\u0027 She also asked officials what kind of shape the children are in when they arrive. \u0027I\u0027ve heard they are very happy. They love to study. They love school,\u0027 the First Lady said.Additionally, she wanted to know how long the children stayed at the center and if they were without the parents.Officials told her the majority of the children had arrived unaccompanied - meaning it is unclear how many were victims of family separation.           First lady Melania Trump greets boarder patrol agents before boarding a plane at McAllen Miller International Airport          SMILE!

There was laughter and lots of smiles, including three girls in the back row, hairs in buns, who were smiling a lot. A boy in the front row had a Spanish-English dictionary in front of him. Many of the kids wore gray T-shirts that said \u0027We Are One\u0027 with we in red, are in white and one in blue.Mrs. Trump asked inidually where they were from, how long they\u0027d been there. She spoke in English. Some responded in English. Others, the teacher translated for Mrs. Trump. As she left she said, \u0027Be kind and nice to other, ok? Nice to meet you.\u0027 And then she helped them resume their counting exercise they\u0027d been doing before she got there, chanting \u002762, 63, 64, 65.\u0027In the next classroom, the children were learning about angles and lines. The teacher explained a contest to build model bridges to Mrs. Trump. Kids worked in groups of four and whichever bridge held the most weight wins.\u0027Bubye. Good luck,\u0027 the first lady said. The kids applauded as she left. In the third classroom, a poster of U.S. presidents that went through George W. Bush was on the wall to the right of the door. A hand painted U.S. flag covered the white wipe board. It read \u0027Welcome! First lady.\u0027There were 12 kids in this room and all were girls. Mrs. Trump asked where they were from. One said she\u0027d been here for two months. Another told her they were learning how to celebrate the Fourth of July.They each signed to flag to give to her. Aides began to roll it up but the plan changed. Melania Trump signed it herself before leaving, to leave behind as a gift.She also asked what kinds of music they like.\u0027They like to dance a lot,\u0027 the teacher said. Mrs. Trump asked for a demonstration but then laughed. \u0027This is a serious class.... so study hard\u0027 and be kind to each other, she told them and added that friendship  \u0027is very important.\u0027She then moved to the nurses office for a briefing on medical care. Grisham said the first lady wanted see the facilities for herself and to thank the staff working in them.\u0027Her goals are to thank law enforcement and social services providers for their hard work, lend support and hear more on how the administration can build upon the already existing efforts to reunite children with their families,\u0027 Grisham said.Her visit comes amid a political firestorm for the Trump administration. President Donald Trump took heavy criticism from both sides of the aisle, former presidents and his own wife about the \u0027zero tolerance\u0027 immigration policy that resulted in migrant children being separated from their families at the border.Melania Trump issued a rare public statement on the issue over the weekend, inserting herself into a policy issue that she had previously been silent upon.Her next visit was scheduled to be the Ursula Border Patrol Processing Center, a Customs and Border PatrolDepartment of Homeland Security intake center where migrant families spend a few days.But that was canceled due to flooding.Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar traveled with her.Her spokesperson said the First Lady will continue to be a vocal presence on the issue as administration officials try to work out ways to reunited children and their families after President Trump signed an executive order on Wednesday.\u0027While we\u0027re going through that process she\u0027s going to lend her support and promote family reunification and I\u0027m sure she\u0027ll continue to give her husband opinions on what she\u0027s thinking along the way,\u0027 Grisham said of the visit.Trump in fresh broadside on immigration as he claims...Texas migrant detention center scrambles to source 5,100...Share this article    Dress down: The First Lady flew to McAllen, Texas, dressed in Adidas Sam Smith shoes, white pants, a creme button down safari shirt and a green jacket          Sober trip: Melania Trump said she was in Texas to thank social workers and law enforcement for their work \u0027in these hard times\u0027          Wet arrival: The First lady arrived at McAllen airport on a government jet in heavy rain for her visit to a children\u0027s shelter and a border processing center          Husband\u0027s blessing: Donald Trump, who held a cabinet meeting in the White House while his wife toured the facility, supported her visit, the First Lady\u0027s spokeswoman said          Frenzy on the border: At the same time as the First Lady was in McAllen, Democratic mayors and activists were holding a rally at the Tornillo port of entry near El Paso, protesting family separations          On the border: Melania Trump visits the Upbring New Hope Children Center, run by the Lutheran Social Services of the South, in McAllen, Texas, an unexpected visit the day after her husband ended the policy of family separation at the border          here to see what\u0027s happening: The First Lady\u0027s spokeswoman said Melania wants to see children reunited with their families. \u0027She\u0027ll do everything she can and she\u0027ll speak her opinions as much as she can.\u0027Grisham emphasized how much the first lady wants to see children reunited with their families.\u0027She\u0027ll do everything she can and she\u0027ll speak her opinions as much as she can.\u0027 Helping children is slowly becoming the first lady\u0027s signature issue. When she announced her policy agenda four days before she had a kidney procedure, she called it \u0027Be Best\u0027 and said she would help children become the best they can be.She appears most comfortable when she is with children. Often bending down to speak with them and smiling broadly at them and their questions.The visit also marks a rare solo public trip for Melania Trump, who eased into her role as first lady and then disappeared from the public eye for 25 days in May after she under went a kidney operation.And her comes after President Donald Trump credited her and daughter Ivanka for helping change his mind about separating children from their families.President Trump, when he signed his executive order on the issue on Wednesday, indicated that lobbying from Ivanka, who showed him pictures of the caged and kenneled children, and wife Melania had caused him to have a change in heart.\u0027Ivanka feels very strongly about it. My wife feels very strongly about it. I feel very strongly about it. I think anybody with a heart would feel very strongly about it,\u0027 he said.The first lady also saw the photos from the border and heard the recordings of children being separated from their families.\u0027She\u0027s seen the images. She\u0027s heard the recordings,\u0027 Grisham said. \u0027She was on top of the situation before any of that came out. She was concerned about it.\u0027Grisham said Mrs. Trump saw the images of kids behind chain link fence at an intake facility.\u0027The images struck her, as a mother, as a human being.\u0027Melania Trump asked her staff on Tuesday to plan a trip as soon as possible – before President Trump signed the executive order and Grisham said she wasn\u0027t sure if Mrs. Trump knew that the order was coming.          Mobile: The First Lady\u0027s rare solo trip outside Washington D.C. to a children\u0027s center where she looked at artworks made by detained children came after her husband entered a political firestorm over illegal immigrant families being separated  Public expression: The First Lady\u0027s involvement in the border separation crisis marks a new phase in her public profile\u0027I don\u0027t know what she knew. She knew what she wanted to do and she told us,\u0027 Grisham said.\u0027She wanted to see everything for herself…. She supports family reunification. She thinks that it\u0027s important that children stay with their families.\u0027\u0027This was 100 percent her idea. She absolutely wanted to come.\u0027And it was her idea to visit before her husband signed his executive order, Grisham said, and she had no second thoughts after the order was signed.\u0027She wants to see what\u0027s happening for herself and she wants to lend her support, executive order or not. The executive order certainly is helping pave the way a little bit, but there\u0027s still a lot to be done.\u0027President Trump supported this trip but he didn\u0027t send her.\u0027This was her decision. She told her staff she wanted to go and we made that happen. He is supportive of it but she told him, \u0027I\u0027m headed down to Texas,\u0027 and he supported it.\u0027\u0027She wants to see these children and she wants to help children. It\u0027s not about anything more than that…. She wants to see what\u0027s real. She wants to see a realistic view.\u0027The immigration debate is a rare public policy issue that Melania Trump has inserted herself into.The first lady issued a rare public statement on Sunday about her husband\u0027s \u0027zero tolerance\u0027 policy.It appeared to break with the Trump administration\u0027s stance.Grisham said in a statement  that \u0027Mrs. Trump hates to see children separated from their families and hopes both sides of the aisle can finally come together to achieve successful immigration reform\u0027.\u0027She believes we need to be a country that follows all laws, but also a country that governs with heart.\u0027Melania Trump is an immigration herself. She was born in Yugoslavia, what is now Slovenia and came to New York City in 1996. She became a permanent resident of the U.S. in 2001 and became a citizen in 2006.She is the first naturalized U.S. citizen to become First Lady of the United States. Asked if her immigration background influenced Mrs. Trump\u0027s views, Grisham said she didn\u0027t know.\u0027I don\u0027t know that it plays into her thinking but I can tell you guys that when she came into this country she did it legally and she feels that everybody should enter the country legally,\u0027 she said."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/21/16/4D7DF55400000578-0-image-m-33_1529594767291.jpg","title":"Bouncing dog appears act like kangaroo continues jump down","story":"The dog could be seen bouncing up and down over the side of the garden fenceThe funny video was uploaded to YouTube and has already racked up several hundred views.The clip begins in an unsuspecting way with just a view of the house and the surrounding plants and trash cans before suddenly the bouncing pooch manages to peek over the top. The dog then continues to bounce up and down, appearing at a different spot each time with his ears hilariously flapping in the wind.Occasionaally the pet seems to be looking in another direction as he takes in all of his surroundings as to what lies beyond the fence.Either way, the person behind the camera filming the bizarre sight, started chuckling with delight as the dog begins to bark with with pleasure. That\u0027s the spot!

It’s far too distracting for children having mobile phones. \u0027Texting, sexting, all this takes place. Mobile phones go off in classrooms, disrupting lessons. Ban them.‘If children want to use a phone in an emergency they can use the school phone.’          If implemented, the ban would mean punishments for pupils who disobey - and in extreme instances could even result in court action against parentsIn France, the government has said inidual schools should decide how they will enforce the ban.It has been suggested that pupils could hand in their phones at the start of each school day and receive them back at the end of the day.This would mean children could still have their devices during the journeys to and from school, which they may need for safety reasons.Current Ofsted boss Amanda Spielman is also throwing her weight behind school leaders who ban the devices, telling the Festival that the place of smartphones in the classroom is ‘dubious at best’.          Sir Michael is the first to suggest that a ban on mobile phones in schools should be enshrined in lawHowever, Sir Michael is the first to suggest that a ban on mobile phones in schools should be enshrined in law.During his wide-ranging discussion, Mr Wilshaw also angering teachers by saying there are some who ‘knock off at 3.30’ and are ‘lazy’.‘There is an education establishment out there that doesn’t like change, doesn’t like people like me saying “you’ve got some people in your own profession who are lazy and feckless and you need to get rid of them”,’ he said.‘They don’t like that. There is an education establishment that doesn’t like change and reform.’Sir Michael suggested that the teaching profession can be ‘defensive’ and would say that all teachers are hard-working and professional.‘They’re not,’ he said.‘I’ve been teaching for 43 years, head teacher for over 30. Not all teachers are professional, not all teachers are committed, not all teachers do their best.’It is the job of a head teacher to identify those that do their best, and those that do not, he added.However, Dr Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said: ‘Teachers work more unpaid overtime than any other profession, much of it unnecessary work driven by the fear of Ofsted inspections.‘Sir Michael Wilshaw significantly contributed to an atmosphere in schools where it is presumed that something is not done unless it is written down and documented.‘This culture of low trust is one of the major factors driving teachers from the profession, and this is lowering standards of education in England.’ "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/20/08/1A732CE000000514-0-image-a-7_1529478914936.jpg","title":"Novice trader accidentally makes 9m practice account turns real","story":"A novice trader made £9million after his practice account turned out to be realA panicked Traore carried on buying and, after building up a £3.8billion position, he managed to turn the loss into a profit of £8.8million.London-based Valbury is refusing to pay the Frenchman his profits. In response, the married father of two is suing the company for the cash.Dixons Carphone posts profits plunge in wake of major cyber...FTSE CLOSE: Markets bounce back as trade worries simmer...Housebuilder Berkeley unveils profit jump but warns on...Will you get a windfall from Equitable Life? More than...Debenhams issues THIRD profit alert in just 6 months as...ALEX BRUMMER: Beijing shown a red card as Government moves...Chinese takeover blocked: Ministers use national security...FTSE CLOSE: Shares slide as trade war worries grip markets...Supermarkets and suppliers step up efforts to block £14.1bn...Share this articleValbury argues that it does not have to pay out because Traore thought he was using a demo account rather than a real one, and because he breached the company’s trading limits.The 41-year-old’s lawyers claim that this is wrong because he made most of his profits after realising the account was a live one, and that Valbury had failed to impose any limits.If Valbury loses it could cripple the business, which had revenues of £9.9million in 2016 and lost £455,405.Robert Falkner, a partner at Valbury’s lawyer Reed Smith, said: ‘We are familiar with the spurious allegations made by the French arcade trader Mr Traore... which are strongly denied as wholly without merit and will be vigorously contested.’ Good for big potsGood for big potsFee back in trades Compare the best investing platform for you"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/20/08/1A732CE000000514-0-image-a-7_1529478914936.jpg","title":"TSBs disastrous upgrade saw 1 9m customers unable access accounts","story":"    TSB was unprepared for an IT upgrade which left customers unable to access accountsTSB was unprepared for a disastrous IT upgrade which left 1.9million customers unable to access their accounts, according to a damning internal report.Experts from IBM who were drafted in to fix the crisis said the bank had not carried out enough tests to be sure the system would work when it was switched on in April. TSB claimed that IBM’s findings were only very early guesses at what had happened.The report was written days before TSB boss Paul Pester told MPs on the Treasury Select Committee that the bank had done proper planning before it made the switch.  Dixons Carphone posts profits plunge in wake of major cyber...FTSE CLOSE: Markets bounce back as trade worries simmer...Housebuilder Berkeley unveils profit jump but warns on...Will you get a windfall from Equitable Life? More than...Debenhams issues THIRD profit alert in just 6 months as...ALEX BRUMMER: Beijing shown a red card as Government moves...Chinese takeover blocked: Ministers use national security...FTSE CLOSE: Shares slide as trade war worries grip markets...Supermarkets and suppliers step up efforts to block £14.1bn...Share this articleFirst Direct\u0027s First Account offers a choice of freebies to sign up, including a £150 Expedia voucher , online development courses or free tech worth up to £170.

Bailiffs cleared the hallway after the appearance for the privacy of the children who could be seen from a distance in silhouette as they were ushered out of view.Disturbing details emerged during Wednesday\u0027s preliminary hearing in the Turpin case, including how the victims were fed moldy pies, whipped with belts and choked for watching a Justin Bieber music video.Those present in Superior Court in Riverside gasped when prosecutors showed photos of two of Louise and David Turpin\u0027s daughters that their 17-year-old sister had snapped with an old cellphone before fleeing in January.The images featured two pale, malnourished girls, ages 11 and 14, shackled to bunk beds inside their family\u0027s filthy home in Perris, California. David and Louise have pleaded not guilty to torture, child abuse and other charges. Each is being held on $12million bail and could face up to life in prison if convicted.The couple was arrested in January after their 17-year-old daughter, who had spent two years planning an escape, climbed out a window and then called 911 to report abuse. By the time police arrived at the house 70 miles southeast of Los Angeles, the two shackled sisters had been hastily released from their chains when police showed up, but a 22-year-old son remained restrained.The young man said he and his siblings had been suspected of stealing food and being disrespectful, Riverside County sheriff\u0027s Det.

Investigators testified that one of the Turpins\u0027 daughters (pictured), aged 11, had the arms the size of an infant The 11-year-old girl who had been shackled to her bed had stunted growth from malnourishment and her arms were the size of an infant\u0027s, investigator Patrick Morris said.In her 20-minute 911 call, the 17-year-old who escaped told the dispatcher: \u0027We don\u0027t really do school. I haven\u0027t finished first grade.\u0027The girl told sheriff\u0027s Deputy Manuel Campos that she hadn\u0027t bathed in a year and that she didn\u0027t know the date or the month, he testified.About two years ago, the mother found out the girl had been watching a Justin Bieber video on a cellphone borrowed from her sister, and started choking her and asked, \u0027do you want to die?\u0027 Campos said.The girl said she didn\u0027t want to die, but she feared she was about to as the choking continued.\u0027Yes you do, yes you do, you do, you want to die,\u0027 the mother said, according to Campos. \u0027You want to die and go to hell.\u0027 There was no breakfast, and recently lunch and dinner had been combined into one meal that included peanut butter and bologna sandwiches, a frozen burrito and chips.The girl said she recently had started refusing the peanut butter sandwiches \u0027because she starts to gag and starts to throw up,\u0027 Campos testified.The teen, who said she hadn’t finished first grade, had difficulty pronouncing some words and spoke like a much younger child.The girl planned her escape for two years and was terrified as she climbed out a window to freedom, according to Campos\u0027 testimony.\u0027She couldn’t even dial 911 because she was so scared that she was shaking,\u0027 he said.She didn’t know the neighborhood and had to read her address to the dispatcher off a piece of paper. The kids were rarely allowed outside, though they went out on Halloween and traveled as a family to Disneyland and Las Vegas, they said.\u0027Sometimes I wake up and I can’t breathe because of how dirty the house is,\u0027 the girl told the woman dispatcher.She said she hadn’t bathed in a year and Campos observed dirt caked on her skin and a stink from being unbathed.           Louise was seen wiping her eyes (not pictured) while listening to a 911 call her 17-year-old daughter  made after escaping their Perris, California, home in January  Claws: Both the husband and wife appeared in court on Wednesday with exceedingly long fingernails (left and right)          What\u0027s so funny? David Turpin had a smile on his face during the hearing in Riverside.

She said she didn’t like it and pulled up her pants, and that he told her not tell anyone, Campos said.The children spent most of their time locked in their rooms except for limited meals or using the bathroom.If they didn’t obey strict rules, they were slapped in the face or had their hair pulled, the girl told CamposThe eldest son in the family told authorities discipline in the home included beatings with the leather or buckle end of a belt, said Wade Walsvick, senior investigator for the Riverside County district attorney’s office. Years earlier, when the family lived in Texas, he said the beatings involved \u0027a switch, the paddle and the oar\u0027 and the siblings were sometimes placed in cages.Wednesday\u0027s hearing was held to determine whether the prosecutors have amassed enough evidence to take the case against the Turpins to trial. Authorities said the Turpin children were isolated from each other and locked in different rooms in small groups. They did not have access to televisions or radios but expressed themselves in the hundreds of journals that investigators seized from the home.          Authorities said the Turpin home in Perris (pictured) reeked of human waste, and the evidence of their children\u0027s starvation was obviousMost of the  children were homeschooled, but one of the older boys was allowed to attend classes at Mt San Jacinto Community College.His mother would drive him there, stay outside in the hallway during the class and then take him back home as soon as the class ended, prosecutors said.After they were freed from the home, the children, who ranged in age from 2 to 29, were immediately hospitalized and eventually released. Prosecutors said the abuse was so prolonged the children\u0027s growth was stunted.The current whereabouts of the children is unknown. A spokeswoman for the county\u0027s social services department declined to discuss the case.Jack Osborn, an attorney appointed to represent the couple\u0027s seven adult children, said earlier this year they were \u0027doing well.\u0027           After they were freed from the home, the children, who ranged in age from 2 to 29 (pictured at their parents\u0027 vow renewal ceremony), were immediately hospitalizedThey have participated in music therapy programs, made crafts and world-famous cellist Yo-Yo Ma held a special concert for them.

They do not want people to think of them only as a possible victim, but as young adults setting off on their lives,\u0027 he told the Riverside Press-Enterprise newspaper in February.The hearing is scheduled to resume Thursday. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/21/01/05438E7B000003E8-0-image-m-20_1529542733772.jpg","title":"ROSS CLARK did nightmare happen","story":"    Pub chain Wetherspoon warned yesterday that it is likely to run out of popular brands of beer over the next few days. File photoBut the invisible, odourless gas, which we produce every time we breathe, is also essential for other everyday products.Many abattoirs use it to stun pigs and chickens prior to slaughter. The animals are put into a chamber where concentrations build up slowly, depriving them of oxygen.Because of its inert qualities, the gas is also used in meat packaging, preventing the growth of micro-organisms which depend on oxygen, and prolonging the freshness of packaged meat.Its use explains why the shortage of the gas is causing such alarm in the meat industry, with chicken-producing plants warning of imminent shortages in supermarkets and one major plant said to have only enough CO2 for one more day\u0027s production. The British Poultry Council is warning that without fresh supplies of CO2 to Britain, where some 2.2 million chickens are consumed daily, 60 per cent of chicken production will have to be suspended in days.No chicken tonight: After fizzy drinks and beer now Britain...Pubs could run dry of beer and fizzy drinks as Britain is...Share this articleBut a shortage of CO2 gas will also affect a wide variety of foods, from cooked and fresh meat and ready meals through to pre-packaged salads, the British Meat Processors Association warns.Carbon dioxide is widely used in the fruit and vegetable industry to keep food fresh while it is being stored and transported.As they ripen, fruit and vegetables take in oxygen and \u0027breathe\u0027 out carbon dioxode. By flooding the sheds they are stored in with CO2, the amount of oxygen is reduced which means they take less in, and ripening is put on hold. The gas also helps lessen the damage caused by chilling during transport while moulds and insects are killed.          Many mass-produced beers undergo \u0027forced\u0027 carbonisation, in which the gas is pumped in to produce its fizz. The same happens with carbonated soft drinks. File photoBut although the most immediate impact of this shortage will be felt in the food and drink industries, CO2 is a crucial compound in manufacturing as well. Fire extinguishers contain frozen carbon dioxide because it smothers fires and won\u0027t burn.It\u0027s used to make plastics, in water treatment plants, in the assembly of electronic circuit boards, in the oil industry, in the manufacture of chemicals... in fact, it has an extraordinary number of applications.Which makes it all the more staggering that we are running short of CO2, which forms 0.04 per cent of the atmosphere by volume, too small to make extraction commercially viable. So how did this crisis come about?The reason is that the bulk of the CO2 used commercially is a by-product from ammonia production. If ammonia plants did not sell the gas, they would have to find some way of disposing it.It makes sense, therefore, for beer and food and other industries to source most of their carbon dioxide from ammonia plants – with smaller quantities coming from the production of bio-ethanol, a \u0027green\u0027 fuel made from crops. The trouble is that ammonia plants often shut for maintenance during the summer. The main use for ammonia is to make agricultural fertilisers, and demand from farmers is at its lowest at this time of year as crops are by now well established.Summer also happens to be when the production of beer and soft drinks peaks so there is often some kind of supply crunch around June.          The British Poultry Council is warning that without fresh supplies of CO2 to Britain, 60 per cent of chicken production will have to be suspended in days. File photoThe problem has been compounded by a fall in global ammonia prices. The British fertiliser industry is finding it cheaper to source ammonia from abroad so some UK production has been put on hold.At present, only one large plant in Britain is believed to be producing ammonia and, therefore, carbon dioxide. The shortage exposes just how vulnerable UK manufacturing is to the availability of raw materials.We think of manufacturing as being a global industry. Yet when it comes to hard-to-transport goods such as CO2, industry is still heavily reliant on local sources.The same is true of beer. A remarkable number of them are brewed in Britain. Who would have guessed that when you swig a can of \u0027Danish\u0027 Carlsberg you are drinking a product brewed in Northampton?Just as most European countries had far better gas storage facilities than Britain to cope with the Beast from the East, so too are they better protected against the shortage of CO2. With a less-depleted industrial base, they have access to more plants supplying the gas.All of which points to the folly of letting our nation become dependent on foreign supplies of important goods such as CO2. And which means that if Harry Kane does end up lifting the World Cup, we might have to celebrate with water or good old-fashioned bitter, which isn\u0027t made with CO2.While the Germans drown their sorrows with lager, full of fizz made with their own carbon dioxide which won\u0027t have run out. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/22/00/4D80598100000578-5871989-India_Sturgis_with_the_clothes_mountain_at_the_Oxfam_Wastewise_r-a-16_1529622804364.jpg","title":"Your unwanted clothes valuable earth going on","story":"    Help or hindrance: Academics say donations can restrict new retail economies in developing economies. Stock pictureThe price rag dealers pay for used clothes has climbed from about £220 a tonne in 2007 to about £500 a tonne today — and it’s an industry now worth £140 million.And rather than being unpicked and rewoven, as you might imagine, around half of old clothes you take to a charity shop or retailer are actually sold on — mainly in Eastern Europe and Africa.John Lewis says this is the case with its scheme: the bought-back clothes will either be resold or recycled, but the trial is at too early a stage to give expected percentages in each case.What’s more, charities say donations are falling in the face of this High Street competition, and that criminals are also being drawn to the high prices — there’s reports of donations being stolen.Many firms have sprung up offering to collect clothes door-to-door for free. Shipping them off to be sold isn’t the end of it, though.Alan Wheeler, director of the Textile Recycling Association, says: ‘Just because a retailer collects garments doesn’t mean the problem is solved. Where do they go?‘Typically clothes go through a sorting programme and maybe 50 per cent will be sold for export.‘The rest will need to be recycled: sometimes they are cut for wiping cloths, depending on the material, or they are used to manufacture heat and sound insulation or filling materials such as mattress or duvet fillings.‘Some textiles are used to make “shoddy”, a wool-substitute yarn which can make blankets used in relief work. Recycled fibres can also be used to manufacture the interior linings in cars.‘Even if the used clothing is of good enough quality to be reused, eventually it will wear out and have to be either recycled or disposed of.‘Of course, it would be much better to be able to recycle these worn out items, so it would be good if new garments were designed with recycling in mind.’And in terms of the plastics used in clothes, controversially Wheeler says that if the public turned against polyster in favour of cotton, it would only be swapping one big environmental problem for another.          India Sturgis with the clothes mountain at the Oxfam Wastewise recycling centre in Batley, West Yorkshire Conventional cotton production can cause huge environmental problems. It typically takes 20,000 litres of water to produce just one kilogram of cotton.Polyester — a synthetic man-made polymer and mostly non-biodegradable plastic — is used in 60 per cent of our garments. The most common is polyethylene terephthalate, or PET, which is the same plastic used in soft drink and ketchup bottles.In many respects, polyester’s popularity is a no-brainer. It’s cheap, lightweight, shape-retaining, easy to blend with other materials and long-lasting. Manufacturing techniques have become so sophisticated that it can now be spun finer than a human hair.Forget the rough, thick polyester shirts of old — some modern polyesters rival even the most expensive natural fibres in quality.Polyester or otherwise, what’s the best way to recycle your clothes?The new app reGAIN might offer consumers something different to the High Street take-back schemes. The idea is simple — choose a minimum of ten items to package in a cardboard box and use the app to locate your closest drop-off point.You receive a discount code from the partner of your choice to go towards your next purchase. Above all, Wheeler prefers the good old-fashioned method of taking clothes to the local charity shop — where the money they raise will go to good causes.But what happens to your bag of old clothes once you drop it off?Most of us do not appreciate what a massive and sophisticated operation lies behind your humble, High Street charity shop.I paid a visit to Oxfam’s colossal clothing sorting centre, a 90,000 sq ft former bed-making factory — bigger than a football pitch — on the fringes of Batley in Yorkshire, to find out.Here any excess clothing from its charity shops is sorted — and the complexity of dealing with our fast fashion habit is clear.On the morning I visit, the deliveries are rolling in. Endless steel conveyor belts send streams of black bin bags to workers who sort their contents by hand.Out come Hobbs dresses, M\u0026ampS cashmere cardigans, babies’ bibs, and old shirts and suits, which are flung into industrial wheelie bins for compressing and packing.The walls heave with hay-bale-sized bags of clothes stacked against them and there’s a smell of musty attic fibres in the air.Some 17 tonnes of clothing a day are sorted here. More than half is sent to Frip Ethique, the charity’s social enterprise project in Senegal providing work for 40 local men and women and stock for market traders.

Nothing — not one sock — gets sent to landfill.If items are too damp or dirty to process — around a minuscule 2 per cent of overall donations — they’re incinerated locally to produce energy for 400 Yorkshire homes.Despite this ingenuity, Lorraine Needham-Reid, the site’s manager of production, is still concerned about our wasteful attitude.‘I’m absolutely stunned by what people throw away,’ she says. ‘We see brand new items sent here, never worn, with tags still in. It is scary what people chuck out.’So what of the clothes we send to council recycling banks that are found on urban streets or in supermarket car parks?Sixty per cent is exported overseas for resale in second-hand clothing markets to countries such as Poland, Lithuania, Benin, Ghana and Togo.But this troubles Dr Andy Brooks, a lecturer in development geography at King’s College and author of Clothing Poverty, a book about fast fashion and the second-hand clothing sector.‘People think their old clothes are most likely to be sold in a local charity shop,’ he says. ‘However, there is a large international trade in used clothing that’s hidden from view.’‘Poor countries have had their markets flooded by second-hand garments.‘Factories in African countries including Ghana and Zambia have had to close down because they are uncompetitive.‘In the short term, cheap used clothing seems to be good for poor African consumers, but in the long term it harms their balance of trade and restricts industrial development.’So if recycling overseas is problematic when not overseen by an organisation such as Oxfam, and landfills equally so, could a beacon of hope be ‘fibre-to-fibre chemical recycling’ — essentially, making new garments out of old synthetic ones?Scientists have yet to find a workable method to magic synthetic clothing into new apparel — but the best attempt has so far come from outdoor clothing specialists Patagonia, who use PET clear plastic drinks bottles to make jackets, shorts and fleeces.But there are problems with taking that to the next stage, says Alan Wheeler.‘With polyester clothing you’ve got different dyes, you might have cotton threads within the item, it might have a nylon lining. Every item is different. Chemical recycling processes are looking at how to change all different polyester clothing into one homogenous product that can then be recycled easily.’ A move towards a circular clothing economy is something a few industry leaders are beginning to tentatively work towards.‘We need to slow down the amount we produce and encourage people to keep and use their clothes for longer,’ says Wheeler.‘The whole notion that celebrities and royals like the Duchess of Cambridge are radically “recycling” clothes when they’re spotted wearing the same item more than once is very frustrating. It should be considered normal practice,’ he adds.Wheeler points to the ‘elephant in the room’ when it comes to recycling and clothing retailers. ‘It is difficult for them to be sustainable because their survival is dependent on us buying more and more clothes,’ he says.‘I would argue that they need to encourage the public to buy less, pay more (that way they would pay their workers more, too) and design items that are made to last.’Currently consumer pressure for new garments means companies produce clothes faster to lower standards — which are then less able to withstand repeat wear.According to a recent report from WRAP, the average piece of clothing in the UK lasts for 3.3 years before being discarded.Other research puts the life of UK garments at 2.2 years.For a younger demographic, you can probably halve that. But the experts want us to do better than that.So it’s a case of step away from the shopping basket (literally or virtually), rewear what you already own, and recycle those you don’t — this way you save the planet as well as your pennies. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/21/17/4D7E140800000578-0-image-m-132_1529597757242.jpg","title":"Archaeologists dig Woodstock site USA 1969 festival New York","story":"Jesse Pagels (left) and Edgar Alarcon, of the Public Archaeology Facility at Binghamton University, start a new dig at the site of the original Woodstock Music and Art festival   Paul Brown, of the Public Archaeology Facility at Binghamton University, measures a dig at the site of the original Woodstock Music Festival in 1969  Paul Brown, of the Public Archaeology Facility at Binghamton University, displays a pop top recovered from a dig at the site of the original Woodstock Music and Art Fair, in Bethel  Collected artifacts from a dig are recorded at the site of the original Woodstock Music and Art Fair, in Bethel\u0027The overall point of this investigation is to kind of define the stage space,\u0027 said project director Josh Anderson, kneeling beside a hole that showed evidence of a fence that kept 400,000 fans from the stage area.\u0027We can use this as a reference point,\u0027 Anderson said. \u0027People can stand on that and look up at the hill and say, \u0027Oh, this is where the performers were.

That could help them estimate where the corners of the stage were 49 years ago.During the dig, archaeologists rolled back meter squares of the long green grass and carefully scraped away inches of dirt as they searched for clues about the long-ago layout.\u0027It\u0027s some science.

More than 150 studio portraits from the mid-20th century will offer a rarely seen view of African Americans during the second world war, a time of cultural change, uncertainty and growth of the middle class.“These photos have a certain quality and beguiling characteristic that separate themselves from the huge population of images we see every day,” said Jeff Rosenheim, the Met’s photography curator. “They tell stories that other stories from the same time do not.”The exhibition features classic photo portraits of parents with their newborns, or standing proudly in lavish fur coats, suits and ties. Standing before picturesque, painted scenery of forests, many are smiling while wearing their Sunday best, like feathered hats, pearl earrings and leather gloves, or clutching their purses with perfect nail polish.However, most of the photographers and their subjects featured in this exhibition are unknown, making it an exhibition of anonymous portraits said Rosenheim, who is the author of 10 books on Depression-era photojournalist Walker Evans. He also previously curated the Met’s Photography and the American Civil War exhibition from 2013. One of the few known studios in the exhibition is Daisy Studio, which was on the historic Beale Street in Memphis, Tennessee. Many of Daisy’s photos (which are marked by the brand’s logo on a wooden slab in the bottom left corner of each photo) show young people in the south taking their portraits before enlisting in the war.“They’re leaving home for the first time, their future is uncertain,” said Rosenheim. “Without too much fanfare and with economy of means, it makes these pictures just stunning. They allow us to look at a time and a place that changed the country. It’s on the cusp of the civil rights era and there was great stress because of the war, but it was also a time of introspection.”But the people in the photos are anonymous and there is no real way to trace them, besides the Met’s visitors being able to recognize their loved ones. As most of the photos here show people going off to war in their late teens and early 20s, and having been photographed in the 1940s and 1950s, the subjects could be in their 80s or 90s today.“We hope that with the public’s attention, we can identify some of the subjects, as most of them are unknown,” said Rosenheim. “People might be able to recognize a family member or a friend and attach a name to these faces.”These photos build on the museum’s ever-growing photography portraiture collection, which starts with the 1840s and continues to the present. They were acquired by the Met between 2015 and 2017 from the Rose Bowl flea market in Pasadena, California, though many were believed to be photographed in the midwestern and southern cities of Memphis, New Orleans and Kansas.“The power and meaning of these collections are sites of collective memory,” said Rosenheim. “Most of the people are at the end of a long life right now and the photos are moving around as part of their natural progress.”It was a tradition to go to photo studios and pose in a new military uniform, either alone or with parents, siblings or loved ones, which would then be printed and mailed to the soldiers and sailors abroad as a memory.“It was a time people were more thinking about the fragility of life,” said Rosenheim.Photo studios thrived during Pearl Harbor and during the 1950s, right before mass media culture took over in America. “It’s a sweet spot,” said Rosenheim.The fashion of the time was utilitarian but stylish. While many posed in military garb, others show women wearing smart A-line dresses with plastic handbags, whimsical brooches, stylish wristwatches and high heels.It was an act of personal inidualism going to a photo studio. “For those iniduals who chose to pose for themselves, it was an act of self-expression,” said Rosenheim. “These pictures show that it was a time of transition for these iniduals they are choosing to pose for their own reasons – it’s not because their parents or the military told them to do so.”Some of the photos are hand-painted with color, whether it’s the background to give the portrait more life, or as makeup, like plump red lip color for the women. Rosenheim explains that studio photographers could make extra money by applying color to photos by hand, which would help increase their revenue.Just as the population in the south was segregated, so was the military. “There was the civil rights struggle for African Americans, not just voting rights but every other freedom,” said Rosenheim. “In these pictures, we see them in reflection of where they are and what their conditions are.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bf195bbaf6ef1708068fb6d3b062091c1027b0e7/0_467_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ee761239b1eec98193a467d593c2cf8c","title":"spirit north john kippin english heritage in pictures","story":"Historic England has commissioned the photographer John Kippin to create a series of images that capture the region’s multifaceted identity and cultural significance.

Also known as sensory integration difficulties, SPD can affect the way people, particularly those on the autism spectrum, process everyday stimuli, from light to touch.Their innovative work won Corti and Parati an AXA Health Tech \u0026amp You Award as part of the AXA Health Tech \u0026amp You programme, which aims to identify inidual champions, innovators and organisations that are creating exciting and pioneering health tech. In addition to winning awards, Corti and Parati’s work has also gained the attention of research academics and manufacturers in Italy.“If it is not treated effectively, it can result in clumsiness, behavioural problems, anxiety, depression or failure at school,” says Corti, a product designer specialising in textiles and furniture. She says hypersensitivity is often part of SPD, which can result in an enhanced sensitivity to sounds, smells and physical contact. “The textures, stitches and labels in regular clothes can cause unsustainably painful reactions,” she says. Left untreated, these symptoms can be disabling, leading to social isolation, anxiety and low self-esteem.The couple, who now have a young daughter, started with comparatively low-tech solutions, looking at the potential for 3D knitting processes, for example, to reduce potential rubbing points. They also looked at ways to redesign – or to build into clothing – some of the specialised toys and medical accessories already available. “Our focus was on incorporating those therapies into everyday objects that would not stigmatise the user as a disabled person,” Corti says. “We wanted to create invisible magic.”But the designers also wanted to think big. What if the elements of a wardrobe could talk to each other? For this, Corti and Parati looked at some of the smart clothing that is starting to become available, typically now targeted at the fitness market, such as Nadi X smart yoga leggings, which pulse on different muscles to encourage correct positions, and the sports vests that measures an athlete’s heart rate and position.“Our smart T-shirt will collect vital data – such as heart rate, breath frequency and movement – which is processed by an app to indicate the stress level of the wearer. It can then trigger the functionalities of other garments in the collection,” says Corti.One such garment is an inflatable pullover, capable of delivering a targeted “hug” to a wearer in need. “Deep pressure or deep touch pressure therapy (DTP) is a firm, tactile sensory input that can consist of firm hugs, stroking or cuddling,” says Corti. “It can have a calming effect on children and adults. Many people affected by autism refuse physical contact with others, but might be happy with a mechanical surrogate.” Other Sensewear innovations include Biteme, a biteable silicon necklace that measures pressure, and an aromatic scarf that can emit familiar, comforting scents.“This is a visionary concept that materialises ideas initially described by Mary Temple Grandin,” says Cesare Furlanello, head of the research group at the Bruno Kessler Foundation in Trento, and an expert in the way machine learning can be applied to biomedical and environmental data. Grandin, now 70, is a US professor of animal science and campaigner for autism awareness. She specialises in the emotional as well as physical welfare of livestock, and also invented a mechanical “hug box” for humans, after noticing how confined cattle calmed down before being inoculated.“As a child, I craved to feel the comfort of being held, but I would pull away when people hugged me,” Grandin wrote in 1992 in a description of the machine, a sort of pneumatic cocoon with pressurised padding that allowed her to control her own hugging. She suffered panic attacks throughout her teenage years before building the device in early adulthood. “Gradually, my tolerance of being held by the squeeze machine grew. Knowing that I could initiate the pressure, and stop it if the stimulation became too intense, helped me to reduce the oversensitivity of my nervous system.”Medical vests that replicate this mechanism have already been developed, but Corti’s priority is to make smart clothing that looks cool. “If you have a difficulty you don’t want people to stare at you, right? You don’t want to feel different,” she says. This summer, a team including Furlanello will introduce some of the Sensewear range to children with autism, to explore its potential to make their lives easier. “Patients are very often reluctant to ‘wear’ cumbersome and ugly scientific devices,” says Furlanello, “but we expect Sensewear smart clothes will be much more acceptable, which will help researchers to collect data and expand the context of the study.”Corti now hopes that the ideas behind Sensewear’s smart clothing might one day find broader applications. “We would like to expand our philosophy to furniture, interior design and objects,” she says. “We think that everyone faces a certain degree of discomfort, so we are also thinking about people who just live in a hectic urban environment and might want protection from overwhelming sensations or stresses.”Imagine having a slow, firm hug, administered automatically and invisibly, on a delayed, crowded commuter train. There might well be a market for that.We’re here to promote the people who dare to dream. Innovations in health technology are transforming the way we care for our minds and bodies.

This year sees the annual AXA Health Tech \u0026amp You programme return, with new categories including the Women Entrepreneurs in Health Tech award, created to encourage and support women pioneering some of the most innovative health technology.It’s certainly not that women aren’t enthused by the world of technology. We’ve spoken to three finalists, budding health tech entrepreneurs – who happen to also be women – to find out about their experiences within the industry.BrightSign develops communication tech for children and sign language users. Its founder, Hadeel Ayoub, travelled with a team to South Korea during her PhD studies to take part in a global hackathon, entering a smart glove that translates sign language into text or speech. They won the competition, which led her to develop the technology further and create BrightSign.“The tech arena in general is definitely male dominated. In digital health specifically, when I take part in trade shows or give a talk in a conference, most often I am the only woman on the programme. I am not necessarily treated differently, but the look of surprise on people’s faces when I am walking to the podium, into a meeting or presenting my technology cannot be overlooked. My name doesn’t always give me away as a woman, so it has happened to me several times that I am mistaken for the assistant while ‘Mr Hadeel’ is coming shortly.”Although Ayoub is encouraged by the progress the industry is making when it comes to being more inclusive to women, she sometimes feels she can be treated like a box to tick.“I feel I have been invited to events so they can even out the numbers and check the inclusivity and ersity boxes. That’s a shame, because I would rather be included for my work, not my gender.“I have to say that in the past couple of months, I have been very happy to see other female names presenting, and CEOs no less. There are a few women in tech in London. We have joined together and meet up regularly to share our challenges and support each other.”Hsin-Hua Yu, known as Sheana, was inspired by her own experiences with scoliosis (curvature of the spine) to create Aergo, a low-cost, inconspicuous postural support system. Sheana, who graduated with a double master’s in global innovation design at the Royal College of Art and Imperial College London, was motivated by a research visit where she met with young people who used wheelchairs but struggled to sit comfortably and maintain a healthy posture.“Students and carers complained about the social stigma caused by not being able to sit upright, which led to people excluding them from conversations or activities. This motivated me to create a solution that helps children to break free from the need for constant assistance and build their self-confidence,” she says.Despite her complex and life-changing work, Sheana feels she faces something of an uphill struggle to be taken seriously.“As a female founder, I feel I have more to prove in front of colleagues, investors and business partners. I find the medical industry is particularly male-dominated and this can sometimes be quite intimidating. I’ve learned that by being clear, firm and professional, people begin to look past my gender and see me for my abilities.”Sheana would like to see a more “inclusive” health tech industry in future.“I’d like to see health tech designing solutions for all members of society. A lot of health tech today focuses on the medical condition and not the person. This often leads to a solution that can contribute to prejudice and social stigma. I believe in creating tech that is accessible to a wider range of users because it has the power to transform lives, remove social barriers, and change perceptions of disability within our culture.” Before creating iBreve, Wahl was working at Google’s legal department in Dublin and Boston. While travelling with her co-creator in Rishikesh, India – known as the yoga capital of the world – the pair saw an opportunity to combine breathing techniques from eastern culture with the western world and its modern stresses.“The growing trend of mindfulness and the increasing popularity of wearables reinforced our endeavour,” says Wahl. “We decided to focus initially on women’s health and wellbeing. So we designed a beautiful and discreet wearable that attaches to the bra and helps to improve stress resilience by analysing breathing patterns with machine learning.”Wahl wants to inspire more women and more ersity as a whole in the tech world.“Inspiring more girls and women to join the tech world is going to contribute to this ersity and benefits society with better answers to the current big challenges we face. My time at Google and at iBreve showed me that working together with a erse team from different backgrounds and with different experiences is productive, insightful and fun.”She would encourage women wanting to break into the health tech industry – and the tech industry as a whole – to listen to their instincts and follow what comes naturally.“The most important thing is to believe in yourself and do what you are passionate about. Trust your instincts and share your ideas and passion with others.”We’re here to promote the people who dare to dream.

It would also help with its “ability to meet its monetary and financial policy objectives in the future”, he said. Hammond said the government would give the Bank £1.2bn, a sum that would underwrite the £500bn lending pot, but the move would not impact public borrowing because the money would remain in the public sector. The half a trillion pound fund could be accessed by commercial banks for funding, including during credit crunch-style financial crises.The move also gives Threadneedle Street greater autonomy in lowering interest rates to zero and providing more money to commercial banks during times of stress, without requiring Treasury permission. Despite its independence from the Treasury, the Bank has needed to approach the government in order to expand its support to the economy – including when it announced an emergency funding scheme for banks in the wake of the Brexit vote. Speaking alongside the chancellor at his penultimate Mansion House dinner before stepping down next year, Mark Carney, the Bank’s governor, said the additional capital would significantly increase the amount of money the central bank could lend without seeking financial backing from the Treasury. Although at first it will amount to more than half a trillion pounds, it could rise to over three-quarters of a trillion pounds.He said the changes could also help the government to strike new deals with emerging markets to facilitate the growth of the UK financial sector, which could increase from 10 times the size of the British economy at present to 15 times by 2030.“We now have a balance sheet fit for a new world order with greater reliance on markets in a wider range of reserve currencies,” he said.As part of the changes, the Bank of England will see the emergency funding programme launched straight after the Brexit vote, known as the term funding scheme – which provides banks with cheap finance during times of stress – become part of the Bank of England’s balance sheet rather than the Treasury’s."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ffa2e90c8c4b0b9f252e26e6161e5722bd6ccaae/0_106_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c8199cfaa4c1ea085ea626d43ee4f3ff","title":"sir philip green in bid to gag regulators report on pwc","story":"Former BHS owner says report on PwC auditing failures could damage his reputationSir Philip Green is seeking a gagging order to prevent the full publication of a watchdog’s report that casts fresh light on the BHS scandal. On Thursday, Green launched a high court bid to stop the Financial Reporting Council publishing its damning report on the failures of the auditors responsible for checking BHS’s accounts. The Topshop tycoon wants sections of the FRC analysis to be redacted or changed, arguing that references to him and other members of the former BHS management could cause “serious and potentially irreparable harm” to their reputations.Last week Steve Denison, the senior PricewaterhouseCoopers accountant who audited the BHS accounts ahead of its sale for £1, only a year before the department store chain collapsed, was given a 15-year ban and and record personal fine of £325,000 after he admitted misconduct. PwC was given a record £6.5m fine but the FRC’s report was not published at the same time.Andrew Green QC, the barrister acting for Taveta, the retail billionaire’s holding company, told the high court it was not seeking to block the publication of the report, which is primarily focused on PwC’s failings. Charles Béar, the barrister acting for the FRC, said it was not in the public interest to make any changes. “Publication of only part of the FRC’s reasons would be either unintelligible or misleading or both,” he said.The Commons work and pensions committee, which carried out an investigation into the demise of the department store in 2016, has already received a copy of the report. Frank Field, the Labour MP who chairs the committee and has regularly locked horns with Green over BHS, has been pushing for its publication. Field, who watched Thursday’s hearing, said outside the court that he would challenge any attempt by Green to modify the report. “This attempt at a gagging order is also gagging parliament,” he said. “At some stage we will have to come and argue there is a wider public interest than Sir Philip Green’s reputation.”Taveta is asking for an interim injunction before a judicial review. Mr Justice Nicklin said the hearing had raised “important issues that need to be properly considered” and he would pass judgment as soon as possible.On Thursday, a leaked email sent to nearly 1,000 PwC partners and written by the firm’s UK chairman, Kevin Ellis, was heavily critical of Denison who, it emerged, had backdated his BHS audit opinion and spent just two hours working on the file.In the email, Ellis described Denison’s supervision of the audit as “inadequate” with too much work delegated to a junior team member. “This situation should not have happened and we need to face up to the failings and learn the lessons,” he wrote."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4fd7dbe102f74a87a1ac11ea8d3778e82c157b4a/0_765_2349_1409/master/2349.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c9297b10e34c063bc690e6b98eb8068b","title":"serene symmetry in the london underground in pictures","story":"Instagrammer Jess Macdonald captures quiet moments on the tube, showing another side to the capital’s transport systemFor most Londoners the tube is an unpleasant hotbed of stress to be avoided whenever possible, but Jess Macdonald captures a different side to the underground.

Robert Mugabe, Muammar Gaddafi, Louis Farrakhan, to name a few. In my book, the policies of May’s government – the denial of fundamental human rights for the Windrush generation, who devoted all of their adult years to the development of Britain – are enough to make her no less a pariah in the eyes of the Commonwealth and the freedom-loving world than those whom her government has sought to ostracise.In July 2013, as home secretary, May’s vans were running around London displaying billboards targeted at “illegal” immigrants, telling them to “go home or face arrest”. These vans misled not just the “illegal” immigrants whom it wished to flush out, but also the public, whom it wished to impress with its “zero tolerance” stance on illegal immigration: “106 arrests last week in your area”. It turns out that 106 was the total number of arrests across the six pilot boroughs in which the vans had operated over a period of two days. Arrests, not prosecutions or deportations.In an attempt to create a “hostile environment”, May placed four generations of Windrush arrivants and their descendants in the sight of any would-be defender of white Britain and its borders, including racists and neo-fascists, who felt they had a patriotic duty to help prevent Britain from being “swamped” by any means necessary.On 16 June 2016, Jo Cox MP was murdered in a street in her constituency of Batley \u0026amp Spen in West Yorkshire by white supremacist Thomas Mair. Cox was unequivocal in her support for refugees, asylum-seekers and economic migrants escaping armed conflict, genocide and hunger and risking their lives in rickety boats to cross the Mediterranean into Europe. She was doing this in a country where Ukip was focusing the two main parliamentary parties on the anger of the white British population at their failure to control immigration and reclaim Little England from the clutches of the European Union, with its Schengen agreement, free movement of labour and human rights protocols.Despite that horrific murder and all it said about Britain and its relentless conflation of immigration and race, the British electorate voted to leave the European Union. What is worse is that, both as home secretary and prime minister, May redoubled her efforts to create this hostile environment for immigrants, condemning long-retired workers of the Windrush generation to uncertainty, misery, physical hardship and denial of the same life-saving health services for which they have paid throughout their working lives.It may well be that May will have the good grace to take the opportunity to tell her invited guests (suggested dress code: “smart attire”) how sorry she is for her part in the brutal, inhumane and racist treatment of former colonised Africans who have and had no interest other than to serve this nation, and do their best by their communities and families. But one of the uglier manifestations of whiteness in this society is an unassailable sense of in-your-face entitlement.I do not believe that the prime minister is entitled to the magnanimity of those misguided folk who might well be happy to attend her Windrush anniversary celebration. As far as I am concerned, I stand with those who suffered detention, deportation and mental ill-health, some of whom even now face an earlier death as a result of being denied access to health services on account of the hostile environment policy.It would be a shameful betrayal to them all to accept the invitation to Downing Street. Instead, the prime minister can invite me again when she meets with civil society to discuss the findings and recommendations of the Royal Commission on Reparations for African Enslavement, which May will no doubt implement immediately off the back of her government’s Windrush scandal.• Gus John is an academic and an equality and human rights campaigner"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/995b94926e01d06be3fac6a33819f293fb88a9e0/0_187_3456_2074/master/3456.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=87d55908d1c6b5ae50e128ecbb26fc6c","title":"abc creates roseanne spinoff the connors without roseanne barr","story":"The new series has the working title The Conners and will star John Goodman, Laurie Metcalf, Sara Gilbert and other Roseanne co-starsABC, which canceled its Roseanne revival over its star’s racist tweet, will air a Conner family sitcom minus Roseanne Barr this fall.The revival of the hit 1988-97 sitcom Roseanne was axed by ABC after Barr posted a tweet likening former Obama adviser Valerie Jarrett to a product of the Muslim Brotherhood and Planet of the Apes.ABC ordered 10 episodes of the spinoff after Barr agreed to forgo any creative or financial participation in it.In a statement issued by the show’s producer, Barr says she agreed to the settlement in order to save the jobs of 200 cast and crew members.ABC said Thursday that the new series has the working title The Conners and will star John Goodman, Laurie Metcalf, Sara Gilbert and other Roseanne co-stars."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ab6227726db93fdbf8b0d0ef5226e957d5f03b32/0_131_3452_2071/master/3452.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0a96aca6a0ad95ee710d521d66817bcd","title":"saving britains swifts in pictures","story":"Swifts are one of the most recognisable birds of summer, returning to the UK to breed in early May each year.

This is a bit different: a rhapsody-montage of archive clips, flickering evocations of bucolic calm, bizarre eccentricity and what looks like real-life folk horror paganism, coming at you with Pathe newsreel voices and spoken arias of agony and ecstasy, all compiled into a mysterious, extended hallucination. Finding a Brexit significance is something that can be done with almost any film nowadays. But this does seem a suitable case for treatment.This non-narrative work is fascinating, though it’s the kind of assemblage that could so easily look complacent and inert. After all, digital editing technology has made cutting together slo-mo images under a soundtrack dangerously easy for everyone. Shot selection and research is something that isn’t easily taught, but Wright has given us some startling and often compelling juxtapositions, and commissioned some eerie original music by Portishead’s Adrian Utley and Goldfrapp’s Will Gregory. Arcadia – the title comes of course with its own unstated baggage of irony – is a film that calls to mind the work of Andrew Kötting or Guy Maddin, but it stands up alongside them, and the music of Utley and Gregory does much to shape the images, bolstering their meaning and form.The film starts with classic black-and-white postcard shots of postwar English villages, the cottages, the pubs, the rubicund inhabitants, the tilling of the soil. It is the “Merrie England” idea that is ripe for a debunking, a sudden descent into the brutal reality of hardship, discord, class ision and racism. Interestingly, Wright holds on to it, and allows us to absorb the fact that, for many, these tropes – chocolate-boxy and trite though they may appear – were not so very far from reality for many people in the 1950s or even now.From here, Wright moves on to find the exoticism beneath the surface, presenting tableaux of paganism, nonconformism and naturism, which are elided with the subversive protest ethos of punk, 17th-century levellerism, and music festivals nearer our own time. Maybe these ideas are a bit familiar, but Wright has cleverly found quite a bit of archive material from local TV news reports about eccentric local customs, shot on film, and originally presented to viewers in a humorous tongue-in-cheek spirit but now re-edited and recontextualised to bring out the deadly serious strangeness that was there all along.Hunting is a rich seam. The foxhunters in their get-up crashing through the hedgerows are like something from Buñuel. Another clip shows a very odd man demonstrating jazz-scat-type hunting cries interspersed with blasts from his horn.Elsewhere, men in dark trousers and shirtsleeves and side partings are shown running and fighting in the streets over a ball, as if in some English Pamplona. A TV interviewer asks three young boys to talk about what they get up to roaming through the fields all day long. One lad is shown doing a series of dangerous-looking somersaults down what might be called a Blue Remembered Hill. The scene chimes with a later shot of the Cooper’s Hill cheese-rolling in Gloucestershire.Sometimes, a simple shot of landscape can be breathtaking. Images of starling murmurations have become visual cliches and seeing one often makes you think you’re watching a TV ad for software. But the murmuration image here is staggering: starkly defined, pulsing and shimmering like a migraine. Did Wright tinker with that digitally? I’m not sure.If I have a quarrel with Wright’s film, it is that, for all its compositional flair, it pursues some ideas that are pretty well established. It’s a film that says that the countryside is not a placid, picturesque place but the site of dark passions, subversions and violence. Precisely. But I found myself thinking of the title of Richard Mabey’s book: The Unofficial Countryside. Arcadia, on the other hand, is The Official Psychogeographic Countryside in All Its Lynchian or Sinclairian Freakiness.

No woman in the 105-year history of the Hindi film industry has ever pleasured herself. But this month, in the blockbuster Veere Di Wedding and Netflix’s Lust Stories, no fewer than three women are featured in onanistic embrace.It is one sign of the rapid change under way in India’s most prolific cultural industry. The past decade has seen Bollywood’s first gay kiss, a hit film about sanitary towels and the industry’s highest-ever grossing film – about the lives of two female wrestlers.“It is a great time for Bollywood,” says Swara Bhaskar, one of the stars of Veere Di Wedding, a raucous comedy about four women who reunite for one of their number’s nuptials. “I think the industry is going through fast and interesting change.”Mainstream stars, such as Akshay Kumar, best known for playing pugilistic action heroes, are wading into social issues without fear of alienating their audiences. Earlier this year, Kumar produced and starred in Padman, a film based on the life of an activist who pioneered a low-cost menstrual pad aimed at improving the health of poor women.In its heyday, in the 1950s and 1960s, Bollywood seemed to exist separately from the fledgling nation around it. “In the earlier years, we accepted cinema in Bombay as a spectacle, an adventure journey into wonderland,” says Sanjoy Mukhopadhyay, a professor in film studies at Javadpur University. “It was always rich boy meets poor girl, or the other way around, but with Indian elements, such as expressive song or dance.”By 1975, India’s fractious politics had started filtering into Hindi cinema. That year, the then prime minister, Indira Gandhi, declared a national state of emergency, ruling by decree, imposing censorship and imprisoning thousands of activists. The biggest films of the year, Deewaar and Sholay, featured morally ambiguous anti-heroes struggling against a corrupt society around them. “These new kinds of heroes allowed us, the ordinary commoner, to feel anger at the injustice in the country,” Mukhopadhyay says.Free-market reforms in 1991 opened India to the world. Incomes rose, and foreign films, television shows and brands flooded in. This gave rise to a new wave of films such as Hero No 1, set in glamorous European locations and featuring characters who switched between Hindi and English, reflecting a generation of middle-class Indians who “were increasingly becoming global citizens”, Mukhopadhyay says.The film critic Anna MM Vetticad credits the national outpouring of anger that followed the 2012 rape and murder of the Delhi student Jyoti Singh for the recent surge in women-centric cinema. “The industry is gradually – too slowly, I say – waking up to the largely untapped market of women with the money to buy tickets and a desire to see films they can relate to.”Yet India remains a conservative country. The masturbation scene in Veere Di Wedding prompted a small but fiery backlash. The Indian censorship board also ordered the purple vibrator Bhaskar’s character uses to be blurred. “We have a culture of silence around female desire and sexuality which is pretty pervasive,” Bhaskar says.The same week the film was released, censors also banned Love, Simon, an American romantic comedy about two teenage boys who fall in love. “The censor board still sees itself as a kind of moral ,” says Alankrita Shrivastava, a Mumbai-based director. She fought the board last year to release her film, Lipstick Under My Burkha, about the experiences, including sexual, of four small-town Indian women. Censors initially banned the film on grounds it was “too lady-oriented” and included “audio pornography”, but the decision was overturned on appeal.“The female point of view is still not so welcome in popular culture,” Shrivastava says. “In the case of my film, I think it was also a class issue. It gave you the point of view of women who are not so economically well off, and that’s still seen as transgressive.”Rising chauvinism across India about religion and caste is also putting pressure on film-makers. Padmaavat, a film about a mythical Rajput queen starring Deepika Padukone, was dogged by rumours it depicted a love scene between the queen and a Muslim conqueror. Angry members of Rajput caste groups rioted in cities and threatened to mutilate Padukone if the film was released.It was finally premiered under heavy security, becoming one of the highest-grossing films of 2018. But it has made stars such as Kumar wary. “About history, people are very sensitive,” he says. “So it’s better to avoid these things … You have to be careful of people’s sentiments.”Bollywood is the most commercial of India’s film industries and the most averse to risk. But the box office success of films such as Padman and Veere Di Wedding are showing that audiences are “not as prudish as we assumed them to be”, says Bhaskar.The next frontier for Hindi cinema would be an unflinching look at the caste system, she says. “I don’t think that commercial Bollywood has looked at caste in an any kind of depth. We’ve so far only chosen to celebrate caste in very parochial and unthinking ways.”More film-makers could also take their cameras outside cities and tell the stories of the rural and poor communities that make up the majority of the country, adds Mukhopadhyay. “There are still too few films about people who ride the metro, or work in the fish market, or take their tea in a roadside stall,” he says."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a70b78caa94ec9a6aa04127194f86d04a4626a3c/0_177_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f10bf587b8a9f151d830ebcec0600c28","title":"argentina croatia world cup 2018 group d match report","story":"Jorge Sampaoli held his head in his hands. Lionel Messi stared at the floor. The rest of the Argentina players were speechless, standing with hands on hips and gazing aimlessly into space as wild Croatia celebrations broke out all around. Luka Modric had just filed a contender for the goal of the tournament showreel and twisted the knife in the process, leaving Argentina, twice world champions, on the brink of elimination. By the time Ivan Rakitic added a third, in the 91st minute, Argentina were broken.This was about as humiliating as it gets for Argentina as the limitations of a team that only just managed to qualify for the World Cup were brutally exposed. Messi, their talisman and inspiration, was a passenger throughout, lost in a game that took place around him as Argentina, abject defensively, overrun in midfield and clueless going forward, crumbled in the face of a terrific Croatia side.To put an extraordinary evening into some sort of context, this was Argentina’s heaviest defeat in the group stage of a World Cup since losing 6-1 to Czechoslovakia in 1958. It is also the first time they have failed to win either of their opening two matches at a World Cup for 44 years. Sampaoli’s players, in other words, were creating history here – just not the sort of history that Messi had in mind when he came out of international retirement two years ago.Messi could never have envisaged when he made that decision that Argentina would descend into such a sorry mess, encapsulated by the sight of Willy Caballero, who made his first competitive start for his country on Saturday, making the sort of blunder that will live with him for ever. Ante Rebic was the grateful recipient of a dreadful pass that sent Sampaoli, who must have covered more yards than some of his players as he paced up and down the touchline in a blind panic, into a meltdown.What followed showed just how weak and brittle Argentina are these days as Croatia took the game away from Sampaoli’s side with alarming ease. Modric, shifting the ball one way and then the other, curled an exquisite 25-yard shot past Caballero, before Rakitic completed the rout by tapping in the third.As Croatia’s jubilant supporters celebrated the sight of their country winning back-to-back World Cup matches for the first time since 1998 – they finished third that year – the Argentina fans sat in silence, wiping tears from their eyes as they tried to digest a woeful performance that prompted Sampaoli to “beg for forgiveness”.With one point on the board and a final group game against Nigeria to come, Argentina could still qualify for the last 16. Yet it is hard – almost impossible – to imagine how Sampaoli and his players can possibly recover from such a chastening experience and one that highlighted all the concerns that had been voiced before a ball had been kicked at this World Cup, not least the unhealthy extent to which Argentina are dependent on Messi.It felt strange, almost uncomfortable at times, to see Messi struggling to emerge from the shadows of this game, waiting for the pass that never came and powerless to bend the match into Argentina’s favour after Caballero’s error. He is still looking for his first goal at this tournament and may not get another chance after the Nigeria game, although Sampaoli summed it up rather succinctly when he was asked about the inevitable comparisons with Cristiano Ronaldo’s contribution for Portugal. “The reality of the Argentina squad clouds Leo’s brilliance,” Sampaoli said.Messi is so often the scapegoat when Argentina lose, yet Sampaoli will not escape the fallout this time. His decision to keep faith with Caballero – something that one reporter told him 40 million Argentinians could not understand – badly backfired and it was also a huge gamble to dispense with a four-man defence and set up with a back three instead. A huge gamble that spectacularly failed.Croatia sensed vulnerability early on and targeted the flanks, where so much space opened up behind the two Argentinian wing-backs. Ivan Perisic, Mario Mandzukic and Rebic all had excellent chances to open the scoring before Caballero pressed the self-destruct button. Only he knows why he chose not to punt upfield when Gabriel Mercado, running towards his own goal, passed the ball back to him. Instead, Caballero tried to return the ball to Mercado with a little chip, horribly miscued and gifted Rebic a chance that he was not going to refuse. The winger volleyed the ball straight back over Caballero’s head and Croatia were on their way to one of their most famous victories.Sampaoli then rolled the dice. He replaced Sergio Agüero with Gonzalo Higuaín, brought on Cristian Pavón and introduced Paulo Dybala, as he became more and more desperate. Messi, with a rare sight of goal, had a close-range effort blocked by Rakitic, his Barcelona teammate, after Maximiliano Meza had been denied by Danijel Subasic, Croatia’s goalkeeper, but there was nothing menacing about Argentina’s play.Croatia, in contrast, looked threatening every time they attacked and ran riot late on. Modric’s goal was a beauty and Rakitic, who hit the bar with a free-kick, slotted in the third to put Zlatko Dalic and his players in dreamland. “We were excellent,” Dalic said. “But now we must be calm, dignified and humble.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/392dff89f072a37097b62b2c2c921e9d445cba1f/0_175_5259_3155/master/5259.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=46510627bd34c86eb9393505895e9210","title":"peru passionate fans make bigger impression than team","story":"• Legions made journey for nation’s first World Cup since 1982• Team eliminated after losing their opening two matchesBut nobody quite saw the wave of Peruvians coming until it crashed into Russia, an invasion 36 years in the making that seemed to jam every second person in Moscow into a red-sashed uniform yelling “Vamos Peru!”When it all came tumbling down on Thursday in a bitter 1-0 defeat by France, it was an emotional goodbye that left some diehards wondering whether the support was so large it might have unnerved their own side.“Some people sold their houses to be here man,” said Eduardo, a native of Lima who lives in London. “You would be nervous too.”The fact that Peru’s defeat seemed inevitable did not make it any less painful for the faithful. When the final whistle blew here, six men in matching Peru zip-ups and Adidas track pants began sobbing in the stairwell, slumping on each other in sloppy hugs of consolation. One man threw his beer from four storeys up and belted out obscenities as he descended from the seats. A father wiped tears from his daughter’s cheeks, smearing the white-and-red facepaint she had applied before the game.“She just told me we shouldn’t have come,” said Rafael Jiménez nodding at his daughter María, who turned away shyly, stuffing her head into her father’s trouser leg. “And I said that this is history, you might never see this again so we had to be here. Sometimes football is like this,” he sighed.It was the cold, some said, shivering under a light drizzle in this Urals city, the furthest east in the tournament and one of the most difficult to reach by transport.Thousands of seats were left empty when France faced off against Australia last week but the Peruvians had no trouble filling the stadium. A wall of red filled the temporary seats that sit outside of the Ekaterinburg Arena, and the singing of the Peruvian national anthem was a tingle-worthy moment.The Peruvians did not have a dance or a catchy song like Mexico’s Cielito Lindo. They were simply legion, travelling as whole families which sometimes ned two continents, with old men speaking in Spanish to grandchildren speaking unaccented American English.“I’m going to get so drunk and drink my sorrows away,” one young man carrying a stack of plastic cups out of the stadium said. His grandfather just laughed and clapped him on the shoulder.There were plenty of chances for this to end differently. Christian Cueva might not have missed that penalty against Denmark, leading to a draw or perhaps win. Cross after cross might have been converted, passes made just a bit more precisely.“We didn’t have what the other teams had: luck,” said one man who gave his name as Daniel. Then he wrapped his arms around a reporter’s back and squeezed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7a98c256bc2322a64b0ef3a4827142e6d92930a6/0_17_4626_2775/master/4626.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=acf64ddd7569dff32e606344a597a01e","title":"rashford sterling southgate meritocracy england world cup panama","story":"At least the signals are that Gareth Southgate’s national setup is run as a meritocracy. Raheem Sterling had spent the buildup to this tournament as England’s match-winner elect, one of a handful of players in an inexperienced squad who had tasted life at a World Cup and a Premier League title winner who had dazzled with Manchester City. The sense was these were to be his finals. They may still be yet.But in a group where everyone is hungry to impress, every quiet performance jeopardises the next involvement. Sterling had shown flashes of his quality in the friendly win over Nigeria at Wembley but Marcus Rashford had scored a memorable goal from distance and tormented his opposing full-backs on the flanks when granted his own run-out against Costa Rica in Leeds. Even on Monday against Tunisia Sterling’s partnership with Harry Kane had rarely fired and, confidence perhaps rocked by a miss at the far post, his display rather petered out. The man who replaced him could run at tiring legs and did so with relish. Rashford has earned his chance from the start.Maybe Sterling can have a similar impact if flung on late in Nizhny Novgorod. At present, he needs some luck in front of goal to reignite his career in the national team and remind the world of his qualities. It has been so long – 21 matches stretching back to October 2015 – since he last scored for his country, and his two international goals from 39 caps have come in home games against the dubious might of Lithuania and Estonia. There is simply no real weight of form behind him at present to make him untouchable.So many of his 23 goals for Manchester City last term had been the culmination of incisive, intricate moves which had left opponents gasping as they attempted to keep up, and were scored by a player darting in from the flank. He was as slippery as any of the forward-thinking talents, and he invariably went untracked while darting in for his tap-in. But England, for all their upturn in panache and possession under Southgate, will not create as many opportunities as the Premier League champions. They need to take what they create.In truth, Sterling has never looked entirely comfortable in national colours as a No\u0026nbsp10. At present, they need someone more ruthless alongside the captain. Rashford has hardly been prolific for his country as yet, but he has started only eight of his 20 caps. The rest have been cameos, and that display against Costa Rica – fellow Central Americans – suggested he can hit the ground running on his first World Cup start. His instincts are those of a central striker.As for Sterling, the temptation is to think this is the time for Pippa Grange, a psychologist and the head of people and team development at the Football Association, who is with the team in Russia, to earn her money. The same player had been substituted at half-time in the second game at Euro 2016, with England losing 1-0 to Wales at the time, and there would inevitably be concerns his confidence could be damaged by leaving him out.Yet the 23-year-old is tough. He has been through far worse than this, not least in the buildup to this tournament whether it was time-keeping or a tattoo that drew him into focus, and will believe he can swiftly recover his place in the starting lineup and showcase his talent.“I look at what he did for the team and what he brings to England, with his pace to run in behind and dropping in and linking the play,” said Jordan Henderson. “He is a big player for us. He is always a threat. He works hard. He is used to the scrutiny now and he handles it all very well.” Sooner rather than later, Sterling will be back."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/350b09667eb4e6c769636e6be74adbbe1b4fc0a4/1_0_3023_1814/master/3023.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=800fff313441e19dcf34bde6f90a2d4b","title":"ronaldo neymar winners losers world cup","story":"Denis Cheryshev, Gareth Southgate and Aliou Cissé have enjoyed a fine opening seven days but it’s not been all roses for Mo Salah or Sami KhediraRussia have been the surprise of the tournament so far and many are still sceptical as to how. If you put the phenomenal running stats to one side (Russia have covered more ground per match than any other team in the tournament) one good reason is the form of Denis Cheryshev, who has spent the majority of his life in Spain and plays for Villarreal. The winger has offered strength and flair from the left side but most importantly has shown calm and confidence under pressure. His three goals have come at crucial moments and he looks comfortable on this stage.Not so much comfortable on the stage as believing he owns it, Ronaldo has made sure the spotlight is always on him in Group B. The hat-trick against Spain may not have been the best of the 51 he has scored but in terms of generating headlines it was spot-on his 88th-minute free‑kick truly kickstarted the World Cup. A poacher’s header subsequently took care of a progressive Morocco side, putting Portugal on the verge of the last 16 and Ronaldo at the front of the chase for the Golden Boot. What would the limelight do without him?On the other end of the attention-seeking spectrum, England’s manager has been making headlines this past week. First he was profiled in the American magazine the New Yorker, described as being a one-man antidote to England’s footballing malaise with his “radical sensibleness”. This quality appeared to have transmitted itself to his team as England astonishingly stuck to a gameplan in securing a late win over Tunisia. Southgate, and the Football Association, are doing things differently this year and, currently, it’s working. That’s good news for everyone, including the country. Just a shame about that dislocated shoulder.Senegal’s 2-1 win against Poland stands them in good stead to qualify from Group H. Both goals had an element of fluke about them but the Teranga Lions earned their luck. Theirs was a victory built on defensive discipline and intelligent use of space qualities that don’t fit the lazy stereotypes of African football. Cissé claimed the victory, the only one for any African side so far, on behalf of the entire continent. The only black manager at the tournament also took the opportunity to speak up for African coaching. “You see lots of African players in European clubs,” he said. “Now we need African coaches for our continent to go ahead.” Cissé, whose touchline moves have also entertained, is doing his bit for the cause.Of all the players listed as potential new World Cup stars, few have shown up so far. Morocco’s Hakim Ziyech played well in a defeat by Portugal, Rodrigo Bentancur has had one good half for Uruguay. Only Mexico’s Lozano has really made people sit up and pay attention. The goalscorer in El Tri’s upset win over Germany, Lozano seized his moment, calmly getting off a shot just before Toni Kroos could shut him down. But he was a menace to Germany throughout thanks to his pace, directness and ability to act out Juan Carlos Osorio’s smart tactical plan. Now the PSV Eindhoven forward has to do it again against South Korea.Football has a complacent attitude towards concussion and it was embodied in the actions of Morocco towards one of their own players, Nordin Amrabat. Injured in a clash of heads with Iran’s midfielder Ehsan Hajsafi during their opening game, Amrabat was floored and withdrawn from the game, albeit after being slapped around the face by the coaching staff. He spent the night in hospital and has admitted to having lost his memory for six hours. Fifa’s official guidance is that a concussed player should not take the field again for a minimum of six days. Morocco suggested they would follow this protocol only to select Amrabat against Portugal, five days later. Manager Hervé Renard called Amrabat “a warrior”. The players’ union Fifpro described Renard’s decision to select him as “alarming”.It might be described as an unwritten rule: don’t deliberately handle the ball in the box three minutes into a match. Don’t deliberately handle it at any point, some might say, but certainly when the game is in its opening moments and you will almost certainly incur a red card. Yet that was what the 32-year-old Sánchez did against Japan, putting Colombia at a considerable disadvantage. He was sent off and conceded a penalty, which the Asian side duly scored. Colombia played well with 10 men and drew level but they were overwhelmed in the end and find themselves in a precarious place in the tournament.Tactically, Mexico did a number on Germany but they also exploited weaknesses in the world champions. Some of these were structural, such as Joshua Kimmich playing in spaces more familiar to a No 10 than a full-back, but some were down to personnel. Khedira has 15 major honours in his career, including titles in the past three Serie A seasons. But the 31-year-old could not compete with the athleticism of Mexico’s midfield. He was ineffective in possession too and all too easily bypassed when out of it. As Germany clambered to get back into the game he was withdrawn with 20 minutes to go.He scored, a consolation penalty thumped into the roof of the Russia net on Tuesday, so the Egyptian King has a World Cup goal to his name. But that is the only consolation in what has been the biggest anticlimax of the tournament. After dislocating a shoulder during an Act of Ramos in the Champions League final, Salah was not judged fit enough to play in Egypt’s opening defeat by Uruguay. Starting against Russia, this bright flame of a player was reduced to a flicker. He wasn’t helped by his position, stationed wide right and away from the action, but each time the ball came to his feet exasperation was not far behind. No player was the subject of greater expectation before this World Cup those hopes have not been met.Another superstar carrying the weight of the nation on his shoulders, another pre-tournament injury, a whole host of question marks. Against Switzerland Neymar draw the ball towards him like a magnet. He also drew the physical attention of his opponents, which may have had something to do with it. But while Brazil’s play was unfailing channelled through the Paris St-Germain superstar, his end product flattered to deceive. He was dispossessed seven times in a match from which Switzerland scraped an unexpected point. Since then he has not trained fully for the Seleção, citing pain in an ankle. There are questions to be answered against Costa Rica on Friday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/42af0257210df756c1ac1e6818c4e0fb6ee2207d/0_232_3866_2319/master/3866.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fef2396635cbbb22a5b09e787ded1c9e","title":"tite neymar team brazil world cup redemption","story":"The coach’s dramatic response to questions about his talismanic striker hints that the Seleçao’s World Cup wounds are still openOf all the qualities Tite has displayed since he became the coach of Brazil, diplomacy has often been to the fore. After his appointment he insisted it was he who must adapt his style to the players and not the other way around. More recently he expressed sympathy for the pain he caused those players who missed the World Cup. After arriving in Russia, he spoke of the expectation his team were under and warned: “We can’t always control the result.”Tite was wise to be circumspect. The man who, just last week, was swatting away questions on how it felt to be universally liked in his football crazy country no longer has to worry about that. A frustrating draw against Switzerland on Sunday evening has cracked Group E open. With an impressive Serbia still to come, Brazil must beat Costa Rica in St Petersburg on Friday. But that is not their only problem. You might argue it is not even their most important.First in the queue for attention, as ever, is Neymar. The blond forward has been the subject of his own little soap opera this week after limping away from team training on Tuesday. This, the Brazilian FA said, was an injury unrelated to the broken metatarsal that kept him out of the Paris Saint-Germain side for three months and limited his World Cup preparation. It was, it said, a sore ankle, the result of being persistently hacked at by the Swiss (Neymar drew 10 fouls against him on Sunday, the most in any World Cup game since Alan Shearer against Tunisia in 1998).In his pre-match press conference, Tite chose not to grind that particular axe. He confirmed that Neymar would play against Costa Rica in an unchanged side. He also insisted he was not taking a risk with the team’s talisman. Asked whether Neymar would be playing were the match not so important, Tite said: “Yes, yes. He would be playing. It’s not a sacrifice. We want to win, it’s a World Cup, but the coach is not going to risk a player’s health by being dishonest to him. That’s a price that’s too high to pay. Those values of health and honesty, no way, there’s no compromise.”It was an assertive, some might say dramatic, response and Tite adopted a similar tone when addressing the other issue dogging Neymar this week, his performance. Alongside the fouls, Neymar generated another striking statistic in the Switzerland game as he surrendered possession a total of seven times. Brazil’s play was consistently funnelled to his feet but often came to an end there. Reports after the match had suggested Tite pulled Neymar aside and instructed him to play more for the team. This claim has been vociferously denied by the\u0026nbspcoach.“Absolutely not. The information you got is not true, it’s not true. It didn’t happen,” he said, but he also used the moment to reiterate the importance of team play. “All the players have the responsibility of playing for the collective and also being iniduals, some with some specific characteristics.“Neymar, I’m not going to take away from him this initiative in the last third of the pitch. He’s a genius. You have my word, this is not true. We all have to work as a team, but we have to respect the characteristics. In the last third of the pitch, you have to create possibilities for the finish. I’m not going to take that away from anybody.”A player whose status sometimes threatens to eclipse that of the entire team (as it does with his club side), is not Brazil’s only problem, however. The Brazilian FA made an official complaint to Fifa after the Switzerland match over the failure of VAR to review certain decisions, including the buildup to the Swiss equaliser.Drama is never too far away from any Brazil side, of course, and any anxieties would be calmed substantially with three points on Friday. But the noises coming from within the camp this week do not sound like a team entirely at ease with themselves and the same could also be said of their performance against the Swiss. Four years on from the Mineirazo, the talk before this World Cup was of a squad determined to put behind them the national humiliation of the loss to Germany. It was always a challenge to imagine those deep wounds had healed entirely, but they may be closer to the surface than we thought."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d13da60fb24fb5554a395cfa37c1ca3e2a174e1b/519_546_4183_2510/master/4183.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0dbc996f6fa233f541c6b9cece30fe90","title":"how to eat like chef less than 20 pounds week thrifty recipes","story":"Buy in bulk, shop seasonally and eat your (carrot) greens … Eco chef Tom Hunt shares his thrifty food tips, shopping lists and recipes for breakfast, lunch and dinnerFood sustainability isn’t just about protecting our environment, it’s about protecting us, the consumers, and supporting the farmers who make our food.Affordability is a key element of what a sustainable diet looks like. I call my approach Root to Fruit eating. It is a philosophy that aims to make it easier for people to cook good food, blending a little chef’s knowhow with academic research, and making it applicable to home cooks and professionals alike. My shopping list comes in at just over £18 a week – cheaper than the average national weekly spend per person of £24. Over a year, that’s a saving of about £300 while still enjoying top-quality food (I buy everything from my local independent health-food shop or market, or organic items from the supermarket. Of course, if you need to bring the cost of your shopping down further, buy non-organic). I’m a vegetarian, so there is no meat on my shopping list, and eating less meat is certainly a good way of keeping costs down. However, if you are buying meat, opt for cheaper cuts of higher-welfare animals.That margin is there to cover the cost of rent, staff, utilities and, if you’re lucky, a profit. But chefs love good produce, so they devise other ways to keep their costs down, turning scraps that cost pennies into a fine meal for which patrons are happy to pay pounds. Noma, for example – one of the best restaurants in the world – serves cod’s head as a main course. Taking on board a chef’s thrift in the kitchen will help you save money while eating healthily and sustainably – as my guide and recipes show.The best chefs will buy local and seasonal ingredients where possible. Pineapples and pomegranates are luxuries to be enjoyed, but base the bulk of your weekly shop on seasonal produce from the market or through a veg box scheme and you will have a double win, improving the taste and economy. Alongside your basics (eggs, milk, butter, cheese, bread etc) choose a variety of fresh fruit and vegetables including legumes, brassicas and roots. Chefs buy in bulk it’s cheaper in the long run and reduces unnecessary packaging. Store cupboard items are an investment – you can build up a variety over time. Having a few key items in the store cupboard is a great way to ensure there is always an affordable meal in the house. Dried pulses come with a low price tag – even when they are organic – and a little goes a long way. Just 5p’s-worth (60g per person) will provide the bulk of a meal. Other items such as lentils, grains, dried fruit, nuts and seeds will give you a variety of delicious ingredients to experiment with making your own dishes.

Otherwise, invent your own dish. With fresh vegetables, you can’t go wrong. Roast, saute or simmer vegetables, toss them with herbs or toasted spices and serve them with a grain of your choice. About 50g of rye, barley, spelt or rice (10-16p) is a good portion. Or be inventive and concoct your own soup or stew to use up the withered vegetables hiding at the back of the fridge.Spiced rice, roasted broccoli, carrot and peanut saladI live off salads such as this.

After dazzling at the turn of the century with smash dance hits Sing It Back and The Time Is Now, they imploded in 2003, with Murphy going on to build a wonderfully unruly and rich solo career, following her own path. “I’ve always done things that way because of the life that I lived, you know?”Murphy’s musical education began early with her wayward Irish family. “They were wheeler-dealers, always only working for themselves, laying roads, collecting antiques, whatever – that gave me a kind of freedom.” Her dad was a fantastic singer who loved playing with words (“a character – a bollix! – but I love him”), while her uncle was a jazz bandleader who commanded a crowd (“pitch-perfect – when people drank, everything revolved around him”).“It was a pretty sort of out-there thing for our first,” says Murphy, proudly. Its drum programming foreshadowed early jungle, she says, and its lyrics – about reincarnation, blind men filling up with light and birds with nowhere to fly – are psychedelic and strange. “I was aware that I wasn’t experienced enough to write a soul song at that point, and even said it in interviews: I would be bullshitting you if I wrote about how painful my last breakup was, because it wasn’t. So I went somewhere else – into my head, my imagination, to a place where I was acting, playing parts, like performance art.” She has felt happy in that place ever since.By Moloko’s last album, Murphy could write soul songs. 2003’s Statues was made after she broke up with Brydon, the only person with whom she had ever made music. “It felt like maybe I’m destroying everything. Maybe I’m not going to be able to make records without him. What the fuck have I done with the last eight years? I was 29. Worried, to say the least.”Forever More is a “fucking masterpiece,” she gushes – the arrangement by producer and long-term associate Eddie Stevens remains one of her favourites. It begins darkly with squelchy sub-bass, before disco brass turns Murphy’s lovelorn lyrics (“Gotta find me somebodyBut there’s nobody to love me”) into prime Salsoul material.Do her and Brydon ever talk now? “No, not much, no. Very rarely, something comes up where I have to ring him, and he goes: ‘Ugh. It’s not you, is it?’”Murphy’s first solo album, 2005’s Ruby Blue, was made after she moved nervously from Sheffield to London. “London seemed like an alien landscape. My world was a tiny bubble before – even the band were slightly outside me and Mark, and then everything else totally outside of that.” Producer Matthew Herbert had been pushing Murphy to work with him, and when she finally agreed, he said to bring something to facilitate their first session. “I thought he meant something inspiring, so I brought this Brian Eno article about a project called the Long Now, about him putting a clock into a cliff that counts for 700 years – I thought maybe it could inspire a song. And Matthew, says: ‘OK, hit it across the microphone.’” She laughs. “That was the start! And then I was bringing hairspray, hairdryers, shoes ...”Through Time is like a 21st-century Dusty Springfield song, all soft melodies and featherlight electronic backing. Herbert taught Murphy the benefits of structure in the studio, too: he did an 11am – 6pm working day, which she still sticks to (“and I always come out with something”). He also taught Murphy about her voice being just a thing in her music. “He uses found sound. He made me realise I was a found sound too.”EMI signed Murphy soon after and she made the brilliant, full-throttle pop album Overpowered – before disaster struck again. Murphy’s boss at EMI took the record straight to someone he knew at the top of BBC Radio 1, who took it on holiday with his wife on his return, he said they both loved it, then added they weren’t going to play it at the station. “So the whole thing about these men running the industry, blah-blah, it can be counterproductive. If we’d promoted Overpowered from the ground up, a different thing might have happened. Because someone knew the right guy, it destroyed my chance.”The fantastically dark, gloopy R\u0026ampB of Primitive is Murphy’s favourite track from the album, written in Miami with Ill Factor and Jimmy Douglass, Timbaland’s mentor. Its tale of animalistic instincts reflects a regular theme in Murphy’s work. “I mean, who gets to put primordial soup in the first line of a song? That idea of not always being in control of the primitive parts of yourself, the bits that fall in love or the bits that dance or lose the plot or drink too much, and putting that across … that’s pop for me. It’s playing with all the different colours of the rainbow of life.”Featuring lyrics such as “Never underestimate creative peopleAnd the depths that they will go”, the nine-minute, percussive Exploitation was a bold statement. “It really was – ‘Don’t fucking underestimate me, because this is going to be murder.’ At the time, I was meeting people who thought I should be doing dance music, people who thought I should be poppier ...” She sighs. “And I feel very strongly about this: I feel like I should really say this to all artists, especially new artists: don’t look to the people who don’t have vision. Don’t listen to them! They’re not there for that. They’re only there to help you along the way.”2015’s Take Her Up to Monto continued the theme of Murphy making complex, ornate pop songs with playful cover art to the fore – she’s a workman in a hi-vis jacket on this album cover, a nod to some of her family’s background laying roads, she says, with a wink. “But certain images are stuck in people’s minds about me. Like the Time Is Now video, God forbid, which is like a fucking Timotei ad. They forget the strength in it, and just think: ‘A lovely blondie girl with her hair flowing.’ It’s difficult to overcome what that leaves in people’s minds, but I try!”Murphy hates how record companies retreat from more intellectual songs these days. She talks gushingly about Cole Porter’s Let’s Do It, Let’s Fall in Love. “There’s irony in it, subtlety, reading, education, knowledge and understanding in spades. But if you gave it to a record company now, they’d be like: ‘It’s too clever. Too urbane. It’s referencing Darwin, dear.’ She blasts “idiots” coming into music studios since the 1990s saying things such as: “Keep it simple, stupid.” “I mean, what’s the point in saying the same thing over and over again? I can write a pop song – I wrote Sing It Back, I wrote Time Is Now, for fuck’s sake. It’s a bloody brick wall that we’re running into today. I’ve worked all my life not to be a simpleton. I’m not starting now.”Until recently, Murphy didn’t really realise she had a great voice. “I’m very throwaway about it because I just opened my gob one day and it came out. It wasn’t like something I had to work at like writing lyrics, or styling myself, or directing videos.” Nevertheless, she had never enjoyed hearing her speaking voice, finding it difficult to speak on stage. “But I’m doing things on Instagram now, where I’ll be able to bring myself to say: ‘Hello, I’m Róisín Murphy’ and it feels OK at last. It feels like me too.”Stefan Kozalla – DJ Koze – approached Murphy to do a track because he loved her voice she wrote this song over his beats in a studio with an engineer. Her original draft had a chorus that Kozalla took off completely, replacing it with a bit of her studio chat: “Me literally telling the engineer, ‘I need a bit of light here’. And he repeats it, ends it back, and I’m all like, ‘Brilliant’, and he’s all like, ‘Really?’ And I was like, ‘Yeah’, and he was like: ‘I love you.’” She laughs. “But that’s me! That’s really me.”Murphy’s all for the layers of gloss being stripped from pop culture. “I’d say no to fans asking for a photo a few years ago, because I wanted to control my image. I knew it’d mean them posting me looking hammered with my arm round somebody.” She felt bad about it, she says. “So now I always say yes. This is how it is now. People want the raw thing. You can’t hide. And that’s OK.”It’s been funny going full circle and returning to Sheffield, she says. “It’s weird in a way – it’s like I’ve bypassed my past. But Sheffield gave me the sense of where all music came from, and it’s good to remember that. It was the perfect size of city, where I worked out the connection between electro into house into hip-hop into soul music and back again. And it saved me, you know, music: being something just to immerse yourself into and be obsessed with, which leads you to be interested in other things.” She smiles. “Do you know what I mean? It all started with music for me. Everything still does.”Róisín Murphy has curated a longer primer to her work, featuring the above alongside other favourite tracks from across her career you can listen and subscribe to it in Spotify below "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/07da2e163a099a97bf0ffa87b932057b7ace5df9/0_800_3762_2257/master/3762.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=79e7c230715849a0adc5c6abb95d2b7e","title":"nile rodgers my family were high functioning addicts i inherited that gene","story":"After a tumultuous childhood, drug addiction and the death of disco, the coolest man in pop is bringing back Chic‘It’s been crazeeee,” Nile Rodgers says of his 65 years on the planet. We have barely met and he is already on to his parents’ heroin addiction, his mother’s three coat-hanger abortions, sexual abuse he witnessed at the convalescent home he was sent to for acute asthma as a child, mingling as a young boy with Eartha Kitt and Thelonious Monk, and life as a Black Panther in his teens. And we haven’t touched on the music – king of disco with his band Chic, supremely gifted songwriter and producer extraordinaire.His voice is rich – part Harvard professor, part meditation guru. There is something so mellow about Rodgers you could smoke him. But when the words sink in, your head spins. It is not just the extremes in his life, it is the frame of reference – Donald Trump casually mentioned alongside non-Euclidean geometry.But back to his mother, Beverly. “My mom fell pregant with me at 13, then after that she didn’t want to have kids so she had three back-alley abortions. They were butchers. Really horrible.” In the end, she had five boys with five different men – all the sons became heroin addicts except for Rodgers (he preferred cocaine and booze). His biological father was also addicted to heroin, as was his stepfather. In his memoir Le Freak, he writes: “Shooting, drinking, snorting and smoking any and everything right in front of me was all part of the daily script.” He describes a family living room dotted with junkies in a state of suspended animation “like a twisted beatnik version of Ingmar Bergman’s chess game with Death”.Aged eight, he saw a man trying to jump from the fourth floor of a New York flophouse. It was his biological father, also called Nile, whom he hadn’t seen for months. Rodgers talked him down. When his stepfather Bobby, who was white and Jewish, almost succumbed to an overdose, everyone panicked. If he had died and the dealer turned out to be black or Puerto Rican, there would have been a serious police investigation. That was when Rodgers learned the world revolved around race.This childhood would have crushed many people. But Rodgers insists it was the making of him. The family home was artistic, bohemian, intellectual. He was treated as an equal (when not having to look after his parents). His mother was smart, gorgeous and like a sister to him (“Everybody else’s mothers looked like grandmothers, but my mom looked like a hottie”), his father was a top percussionist (“The only black person that would routinely play with the Paul Whiteman Orchestra”), his stepfather a gifted mathematician. “They were high-functioning addicts. Always. I inherited that gene.” He grins. “All of them held down jobs. My stepfather was in the schmutter trade. All my brothers worked for my uncle, who had a clothing line on the Lower East Side. That’s why they were able to become heroin addicts because they all had jobs. They were beatniks, they were cool, and they had money to throw around, and they threw it around on heroin.”There was even a family snobbery about heroin. Bobby spent his final days in a Veterans Association home. He was admitted as an alcoholic, but rejected the label. “My stepfather was a rampant alcoholic, but he couldn’t identify as one. They almost didn’t let him in. He said: ‘I am a very proud junkie.’ Hahahaha! I said: ‘Dad, they’re only doing this so you can have a place to sleep.’ He goes: ‘Fuck that, I’m not an alcoholic, I’m a junkie.’”Today, we feel a long way from the Lower East Side of his childhood. We meet at the Serpentine Gallery in London, which is hosting its annual summer party. Shrubs are being pruned into “2018” topiary, champagne flutes lined up and an impromptu dance-floor laid out. Chic will play a private gig for London’s rich and famous – supermodels, actors and the odd politician-turned-newspaper editor. Rodgers is wearing a red velvet jacket, red trousers with more zips than stitches, a silver choker that a pitbull would be proud to own, and a black beret. Few people could get away with it. But Rodgers, recently found to be clear of cancer for the second time, looks wonderful from behind, with his tiny bottom and stick-like legs, he could pass for the teenager who studied classical music at school. Initially, Rodgers thought he would be a percussionist like Nile senior. But the school orchestra needed a flautist. He then moved to the B-flat clarinet, before discovering jazz guitar. Not surprisingly, Rodgers was a precocious youngster. By 13, he was sniffing glue, and by 15 he was sleeping in subways and had contracted gonorrhea. He rarely slept (at the convalescent home, the abuser stalked the dormitory in the dark, and Rodgers learned to sleep between dawn and breakfast – a pattern that stuck). Yet, like his parents, he remained fully functional. He became a session guitarist, touring with the Sesame Street band, before joining the house band at Harlem’s Apollo theatre, backing the likes of Screamin’ Jay Hawkins and Aretha Franklin. At 17, he met bass player Bernard Edwards. Rodgers was a bell-bottomed revolutionary hippy, Edwards a clean-living conservative young man. They became inseparable – and musical life partners.Rodgers also became a member of the Harlem chapter of the Black Panther party. “I was section leader of the Panthers. I moved up in rank rather quickly because I was a martial artist,” he says. What he loved about the Panthers was that new members were given responsibility immediately, to test them. “The day I became a Panther, I had to stand security for Sister Betty Shabazz, Malcolm X’s widow. Very first day!” Was he armed? “No. Just martial arts.”Last year, Rodgers helped out in the aftermath of the fire at Grenfell Tower in London. He says it reminded him of his Panther days – young people taking the lead, transforming the community. “It was like going back to the streets. To sort out clothes, to feed people, to make sandwiches, to make drinks, to carry stuff, that’s easy. Man, those kids were so damn inspirational.”What was his hope for the US when he was a Panther? “I thought America would become this beautiful utopian place. Of course, it never happened. The closest thing that ever happened to it was disco! Period. End of story.”Rodgers has an astonishing mind, racing between stories. Within seconds, we lurch from the Panthers to the ghettoisation of Los Angeles (where his family moved), the manicured lawns of Compton, and America as a nation built on slavery.What does he think about Kanye West’s suggestion that slavery was a “choice”? He blows a raspberry. “Come on! Slavery a choice?” He gives it more thought. “As a human being, I always used to think there were always more slaves than slave owners. Why were we so afraid of guns? Why didn’t we just take over?” So, he has sympathy with what West said? “No, not at all. Let me take you back to my own childhood. There were a hell of a lot more kids in that room than the one guy who was the abuser. At any point, the 20 or 30 kids could have rebelled. But this person represented an authority figure. He seemed more powerful by himself than all the kids collectively. So, it’s psychological warfare.” Is what West said dangerous? “I can’t really tell. I don’t know how seriously people take entertainers nowadays.”Which brings him to Trump. “The first time I met him, I couldn’t believe what came out of his mouth. I was doing The Merv Griffin Show, and Merv Griffin has to be the nicest person you will ever meet. It was myself, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Donald Trump.” Before the show, Trump boasted to the two of them that he had whupped Griffin in a property deal. “He was talking about Merv Griffin in such a derogatory way, talking about how stupid he was, and we’re going: ‘Do you think we’re going to think, “Oh wow, that guy’s a really smart businessman, he must be the smartest guy in the world.” We’re not thinking that. We’re thinking: ‘If you believe you took advantage of Merv Griffin, you should not be bragging about that because he’s the nicest guy in the world. You should feel like a jerk and should shut the hell up.’”Has he met Trump since? “Go on the internet. You’ll see him taking pictures with me all over the place. He was that kind of guy. He used to take pictures with anybody who was happening in the 70s and 80s, and then he’d call the press ... At the time, I was going out with the crown princess of Yugoslavia so you’d see tonnes of pictures of him behind me.” He pauses. “He’s a builder, but I bet you he doesn’t even understand junior high school geometry. I bet you if I talked to him about Non-Euclidean geometry he’d look at me like: who’s Euclid? Hahahaha!”Rodgers seems to measure out his life in girlfriends. He has been with his current partner, former magazine editor Nancy Hunt, for more than 20 years. Like him, she didn’t want children. Rodgers has said he spent too much of his life looking after his own family, changing his younger brothers’ nappies, to rear his own.It’s time for the soundcheck. As he heads to the stage, Paul McCartney strolls past with his wife, Nancy Shevell. He spots Rodgers. It is obvious he and Shevell are fans. McCartney hugs Rodgers, while Shevell gets out her iPhone to take a photo of them together. “Sorry,” she says. “I wouldn’t normally do this.”Rodgers has changed into an all-black outfit. Later, for the gig, he is all in white – every inch the rock star. Funny thing is, he never was one really. Chic were never about iniduals, they were an ensemble. Rodgers and Edwards were the only permanent members. The rest were hired hands, albeit brilliant hired hands (notably Luther Vandross before his solo success). The groove was propelled by Edwards’ driving, repetitive bass. As for Rodgers, he never bothered with showy solos. He played quietly, rhythmically, cerebrally – more like a technician than a frontman.Rodgers has always considered himself a composer and organiser rather than a star. “I didn’t have to be the best performer, I had to be a terrific composer. Duke Ellington cannot play like Art Tatum, right? But Duke Ellington is the guy who makes the plans, the general Art Tatum is the guy who’s going to get all the medals across his chest. So, I became Duke Ellington. I was the guy who made the plan.”Chic are an extraordinarily tight, funky unit. Their songs are impossible not to move to (Le Freak, I Want Your Love, Dance, Dance, Dance, Good Times). Rodgers and Edwards also wrote the classic disco anthems We Are Family and Lost in Music for Sister Sledge. Yet there were so many other influences at play beyond disco – classical, glam rock, jazz, prog rock, soul. They were possibly more influential after their heyday, often sampled by hip-hop artists – most famously Good Times on Sugarhill Gang’s Rapper’s Delight.No band represented the hedonistic 70s quite like Chic. This was before Aids and punk rock. Life seemed simple for young people – sex, drugs and disco. One image summed up the era: Bianca Jagger on a white horse at Studio 54, where owner Steve Rubell handpicked his guests from the beautiful people queuing outside. After Rodgers and Edwards were turned away from the club, they wrote a song about it that went “Aaaah, Fuck off!” It morphed into “Aaaah, Freak out” on Le Freak, which came out in 1978 and topped the Billboard charts for seven weeks. By the next year, it was all over. On 12 July 1979, at a baseball promotion at Comiskey Park, Chicago, a crate of disco records was blown up on the field between games. Disco was dead – long live punk. Chic’s Good Times reached No 1 a month later, but that was their last US hit, and Rodgers briefly became persona non grata.He soon re-emerged as the producer with the midas touch. There was Diana Ross’s album Diana (her biggest seller), followed by David Bowie’s Let’s Dance (his biggest seller), and Madonna’s Like a Virgin (which sold 21m copies). As usual, at the Serpentine gig, he plays non-Chic hits he has either produced (Let’s Dance) or co-written (Daft Punk’s Get Lucky). He also plays Chic’s new single, the catchy Till the World Falls. It’s a taster for the band’s first new album in 25 years, which will be released in September.You must be excited, I say, coming back after all this time. He gives me a look, and says the band has never been away they were always touring, playing his music, and for him that was the main thing. He reminds me that Chic was never a regular band. Until Edwards died, aged 43, in 1996, Chic was the two of them plus extras, and today it is just Rodgers plus extras. “Chic has always been the best musicians I could find who were available at the time. That may sound cold, but it’s actually very warm – it’s the best muscians I could find. Turn over any Chic album and look at who’s playing on our records, the New York Philharmonic, all the best musicians in the world.”Soundcheck over, Rodgers is in a car heading back to his hotel. I ask if he meant it when he said disco was the closest the US got to utopia. He lights up. “Totally. When I walked into a nightclub with my girlfriend, I was a total jazz snob, and she worked at a jazz club. We were maybe 23, and I heard Donna Summer singing Love to Love You Baby and I heard Eddie Kendricks’ Girl You Need a Change of Mind, and I saw gay people dancing with straight people and black people and white people and Asian people and Latino people, and I saw they were doing this dance called the Hustle and everybody seemed to know how to do it. And me and my girlfriend imitated people doing it and nobody made fun of us. I was like, whoa! Because even at the height of the political 60s and early 70s, no matter how much we tried to say it was about peace and love, people would make fun of you if you didn’t fit in.”When Rodgers was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2010, he was told it was aggressive. Is he surprised to still be around? “Extremely. I’m not surprised to be around because of surviving cancer, I’m surprised to be around because the slang on the street was never trust anyone over 35. We lived a live-fast, die-young lifestyle, and that is indicative of the huge amount of people I have lost that were in my world.”Drugs and drink almost did for Rodgers in 1984. “I died eight times in one night and they brought me back. Eight times my heart stopped. I was hanging out with Robert Downey Jr … It was coke and alcohol. I was fine, but then I passed out. Typical rock’n’roll death … you choke on your own vomit.” He says the doctor was filling out his death form when he decided he wasn’t quite done with life. He has been teetotal and drug-free for 24 years.So many of Rodgers’ collaborators have died, often unexpectedly. In April, there was the 28-year-old Swedish DJ Avicii. Rodgers co-wrote his hit single Lay Me Down, and has described Avicii as “the best natural melody writer in my life”. In 2016, Bowie died of cancer. Rodgers has cited their work on Let’s Dance as his most important collaboration because it rescued both their careers. He has called Bowie “the Picasso of rock‘n’roll”, but today he is thinking about him in a different way. “I never met a person who was so the antithesis of a racist,” he says. Is that unusual in the music industry? “Highly.”Is it true the new Chic album features a song dedicated to Prince? He shakes his head. “I took that song off. I had written a song called Prince Said It. Prince and I had been friends for such a long time, and he knew that I started out as a jazz guitar player and that I still only practise playing jazz. He always said to me: put out a jazz album. So, I was going to put out this song that was super jazzy and the chorus was going to have the whole band stop and go ‘Prince said it’ just like his song that went ‘You sexy mother fucker’. Then after Prince passed away, it felt inappropriate. It felt as if I would be captalising on his death. It just felt wrong to me.”As for Edwards, Rodgers calls him “the best musician I have ever seen in my life”. Would they still be playing together if he were alive? “Of course. Bernard died on stage with me.” He stops to clarify. “He passed out on stage and we revived him and he continued playing the show, which surprised the hell out of me. I didn’t even know he had passed out. He died later in his room. If you look at the last interview with Bernard and me, he says there is no one in the world I like playing with more than Nile. He’s my guitar player and I’m his bass player. That always makes me cry.” He repeats it quietly as if to himself. “He’s my guitar player and I’m his bass player.”It would be easy for Rodgers to get melancholy about losing so many friends. But he doesn’t. Instead, he imagines they are still here. “I love how I talk about people in the present tense even though they have been dead for a long time. I still feel I could walk down the street and Bernard is walking with me. I still think about Luther Vandross in the present tense. The other day someone was asking me about music that makes me cry and I said: ‘Every time I go and see Luther and he sings A House Is Not a Home.’ Of course you can’t go and see Luther any more and hear him sing that, but I still think I can.”We are almost at his hotel, and he is thinking about the band he played with as a teenager that opened for the Stooges and Jeff Beck. “They were smokin.” He smiles a lovely boyish smile. “I have never had a bad band. Nobody has ever seen Nile Rodgers in a bad band. EVER.” And the best band he’s played with? He looks at me as if I’m daft. “Chic.” Any particular lineup? “No. Just Chic. They always get better.”• Nile Rodgers co-hosts with Matt Wilkinson on Beats 1 on Apple Music, Monday 11am-1pm, tune in at apple.comatt.

On 7 January this year, the alt-right insurgent Steve Bannon turned on his\u0026nbspTV in Washington DC to watch the Golden Globes. The mood of the\u0026nbspevent was sombre. It was the immediate aftermath of multiple accusations of rape and sexual assault\u0026nbspagainst film producer Harvey Weinstein, which he has denied. The women, whose outfits would normally have been elaborate and the subject of frantic scrutiny, wore plain and sober black. In\u0026nbspthe course of a passionate speech, Oprah\u0026nbspWinfrey told\u0026nbspthe audience that “brutally powerful men” had “broken” something in the culture. These men had caused women to suffer: not only actors, but domestic workers, factory workers, agricultural workers, athletes, soldiers and academics. The fight against this broken culture, she said, transcended “geography, race, religion,\u0026nbsppolitics and workplace”.Bannon, Donald Trump’s former chief strategist, was one of 20 million Americans watching. In his view, the\u0026nbspscene before him augured the beginning of a\u0026nbsprevolution “even more powerful than populism”, according to his biographer Joshua Green. “It’s deeper. It’s\u0026nbspprimal. It’s elemental. The long black dresses and all that – this is the Puritans. It’s anti-patriarchy,” Bannon declared. “If you rolled out a guillotine, they’d\u0026nbspchop off every set of balls in the room … Women are gonna take charge of society. And they couldn’t juxtapose a better villain than Trump. He is the patriarch.” He concluded: “The anti-patriarchy movement is going to undo 10,000 years of recorded history.”Until very recently, “patriarchy” was not something rightwing men were even supposed to believe in, let\u0026nbspalone dilate upon with such apocalyptic relish. It was the sort of word that, if uttered without irony, marked out the speaker as a very particular type of\u0026nbspperson – an iron-spined feminist of the old school, or\u0026nbspthe kind of ossified leftist who complained bitterly about the evils of capitalism. Even feminist theorists had left it behind.Nevertheless, “patriarchy” has, in the past year or so, bloomed in common parlance and popular culture. Once you tune into it, you cannot escape it: it is emblazoned on banners and T-shirts it is an unexpected recent addition to the\u0026nbspvocabulary of the red-carpet interview it is there in newspaper headlines, explaining everything from the Irish abortion vote to the recent murder of 10 people in Toronto in a van attack, allegedly by a violently misogynistic “incel” – a man who believes he has been denied a right to sex with women. Outside the anglophone world, the Spanish patriarcado has been getting a workout so too the German Patriarchat, the Italian patriarcato and the French patriarcat. As the\u0026nbsp#MeToo campaign has grown, so has the use of “patriarchy”. It has burst its way out of the attic of half-discarded concepts to greet a moment – one of fourth-wave feminist ferment – in which there is a newly urgent need to name what women are still struggling against. The resurgence of the term is all the more surprising when one considers the forces ranged against it. Many people would question the existence of something called “patriarchy” to begin with – pointing to the strides made in gender equality over the past century, and insisting that instances of sexism are inidual and isolated, destined to fade further over time, rather than evidence of a persistent structure of inequality. There are others, meanwhile, who regard the\u0026nbspterm’s very reappearance as another sign that #MeToo has “gone too far” – and see “patriarchy” as the hysterical war cry of McCarthyite feminists determined to hunt down men who are guilty of nothing more than past behaviours once considered perfectly acceptable.For some sceptical liberals, there is a resistance to the\u0026nbspideological implications of grand concepts such as “patriarchy” (or “neoliberalism”), which are seen as oversimplifications of a more complex reality. Among gender studies academics, it is no longer in wide use. Once a term debated in endless articles, conferences and books, many theorists now regard it is as too blunt and monolithic to capture the nuances of oppression. Paradoxically, some on the right have enthusiastically taken up the term – regarding it not as an evil to be stamped out, but as a “natural” difference between the genders, ordained by God or biology, to be protected against rampaging feminism.But for those who have lost a basic trust in the forward motion of human progress – or who were born too recently to have known it – “patriarchy” seems exactly the word to explain the continued existence of pervasive, seemingly ineradicable inequality. The moment of #MeToo brought this into relief: it revealed to many feminists that despite all those years of working hard, of leaning in, of waiting till unfairness gradually ebbed away, of absorbing and internalising sexism, of building starry careers or else toiling away in menial jobs in the hope that their children would have it\u0026nbspbetter, you could still be pinned to a bed or cornered at\u0026nbspa party or groped, or leered at or catcalled by a man – simply because of your woman’s body.In this moment, the concept of “patriarchy” has offered itself as the invisible mechanism that connects a\u0026nbsphost of seemingly isolated and disparate events, intertwining the experience of women of vastly different backgrounds, race and culture, and ranging in force\u0026nbspfrom the trivial and personal to the serious and geopolitical. For many on\u0026nbspthe right, patriarchy is not an evil to be stamped out, but simply a natural difference between the genders, ordained by God or biology. For it\u0026nbspallows us to ask, according to the philosopher Amia Srinivasan, “whether there is something in common between the Weinstein affair, the election of Trump, the\u0026nbspplight of women garment workers in Asia and women farm workers in North America, and\u0026nbspthe Indian rape epidemic. It allows people to ask whether some machine is at work that connects all the experiences they’re having with all the experiences others are having.” The return of “patriarchy” raises the question: does the naming and understanding of this invisible mechanism offer the key to its destruction?For much of human history, the persistence of male domination was so much part of the oxygen of life that patriarchy was not even identified as a concept – unlike democracy, autocracy or oligarchy, whose relative merits were vigorously debated by the Greeks. The notion that male supremacy was “natural” was\u0026nbspself-fulfilling, since those who wrote the laws, the\u0026nbsppoems, the religious books, the philosophy, the history, the medical treatises and the scientific texts were, very largely, men writing for the benefit of men. As Jane Austen’s character Anne Elliot says: “Men have had every advantage of us in telling their own story. Education has been theirs in so much higher a degree the pen has been in their hands.” You might even say that patriarchy’s particular power is its capacity to make itself as invisible as possible it tries very hard not\u0026nbspto draw attention to the means of its endurance.But if you look at the world with patriarchy in view, you might see how some intelligent, successful and apparently assertive women fail to leave men who\u0026nbsphumiliate them and monitor their every move (such are the hallmarks of “coercive control”, now a criminal offence). You might see why even apparently liberal organisations, even those run by women, still have a\u0026nbspgender pay gap. Or why about 80 women a year, in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, are murdered by\u0026nbspa\u0026nbspmale partner or ex-partner. Why women do more childcare and housework than men, and why this domestic “second shift” has until recently been completely ignored by economists. Why the clothing of\u0026nbspAngela Merkel and Theresa May is avidly critiqued, but that of Emmanuel Macron is not. Why there are so\u0026nbspfew meaningful female characters in films. Some concepts are like a pair of spectacles that allow otherwise invisible or inexplicable things to be seen with sudden sharpness: “patriarchy” is one of them.The word literally means “rule of the father”, from the ancient Greek. There are many different ideas about its extent and force. Some people have used it describe patterns derived from the structure of the family to others, it is an entire system of oppression built on misogyny and the exploitation and brutalisation of women. It is not simple, in fact, to produce a concise definition of patriarchy. But at its simplest, it conveys the existence of a societal structure of male supremacy that operates at the expense of women – rather in\u0026nbspthe way that “white supremacy” conveys the existence of a societal structure that operates at the expense of black people.Part of the idea of “patriarchy” is that this oppression of women is multilayered. It operates through inequalities at the level of the law and the state, but also through the\u0026nbsphome and the workplace. It is upheld by powerful cultural norms and supported by tradition, education and religion. It reproduces itself endlessly through these norms and structures, which are themselves patriarchal in nature and thus it has a way of seeming natural or inevitable, or else, in a liberal context, it is obscured by piecemeal advances in gender equality. Because it offers the idea of a structure of power relations, rather than a series of specific sexist acts, “patriarchy” accommodates the idea that not all men enthusiastically uphold it or benefit equally from it and that some women may, on the other hand, do a great deal towards supporting it. It\u0026nbspalso allows for the fact that however much we might loathe it, we all, perforce, participate in it.Once you see the world through the lenses of “patriarchy”, the thought naturally arises: what would\u0026nbspthe world be like if it weren’t there? Some feminists have argued that if women gain equal rights in society, patriarchy will be at least sufficiently tempered. Others have argued that even if equality were achieved, patriarchy would still exist, because human institutions – political, legal, educational, cultural – are themselves, in their bones, patriarchal structures. But it says something about the nature of this inquiry that it has most vividly been answered by writers of speculative fiction. In the 19th-century novel Herland, Charlotte Perkins Gilman imagined a women-only society: one of calm justice, efficient agriculture and comfortable clothing with lots\u0026nbspof pockets. In Naomi Alderman’s novel The Power, published last year, women, through a kink of evolution, gain superior physical strength over men. A bloody revolution ensues, and there is no hint that the resulting reversal of patriarchy – matriarchy – will be any less oppressive than what it has replaced. It seems to be a\u0026nbspzero-sum game.“Patriarchy” is not a stable concept. It has fallen in and\u0026nbspout of fashion, flourishing at moments of feminist renewal. Nevertheless, feminism began without it. Mary\u0026nbspWollstonecraft was clear, in A Vindication of the Rights of Woman (1792) that there was such as thing as\u0026nbsp“the tyranny of men”, but it was another 60 years before the term “patriarchy” was adopted as something like a\u0026nbsptheory of social relations.By the mid-19th century, the world was coming to seem older, bigger and more unstable than it had done before. In 1859, Darwin’s On the Origin of Species was published. Marx’s Das Kapital would follow in 1867. At the\u0026nbspsame time, work by anthropologists and ancient historians was revealing that there were, and had been, family structures, legal systems and whole societies that looked radically different from those in modern Paris, Berlin or\u0026nbspLondon. Industrialisation and urbanisation were underway in Europe, especially in Britain women were\u0026nbsprapidly entering the workforce. Two years after On the Origin of Species, and six years before Das Kapital, a Swiss jurist and classicist called Johann Jakob Bachofen published a book whose influence remains nearly as pervasive – even though hardly anyone has heard of it now, its substantive claims\u0026nbsphave been repudiated, and it has never been fully translated into English from its original German. It was taken up strongly by Friedrich Engels it deeply interested Sigmund Freud and its theories were absorbed by early archaeologists and prehistorians. The book was called Das Mutterrecht (“Mother Right”), and its grand theory was that, in a\u0026nbspdistant prehistoric era, the father’s role in begetting children had not been yet recognised, and women (and\u0026nbspmother goddesses) held power in the world.For Bachofen, matriarchy and patriarchy were opposites: dark versus light, “the bloody law of the earth” set against “the pure celestial power of the sun”. His vision of the elementally opposed “female” and “male” has been hugely influential. The idea of an earthbound, essentially non-rational femininity has sometimes been claimed by feminists in a very different way, you can hear the echoes of the rhetoric, roughly filtered through Nietzsche and Jung, in the statements of rightwing male supremacists of today, especially those who speak of the\u0026nbsp“chaos” of the feminine. Bachofen himself was no feminist. The idea of the Amazons – mythical female warriors – particularly disturbed him. They represented “an extreme and decadent form of gynecocracy … man-hating, man-killing, bellicose virgins”, he wrote.When the term “patriarchy” started to circulate in this new formulation, it opened up new avenues of thought on the left. Engels, in The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State, drew deeply on Bachofen in order to argue that patriarchy was a crucial factor in the emergence of capitalism. For him, the arrival of patriarchy – which was\u0026nbspassociated with the recognition of fatherhood, the development of monogamous marriage and inheritable private property – represented “the world-historical defeat of the female sex. The man took command in the home also the woman was degraded and reduced to servitude, she became the slave of his lust and a mere instrument for the production of children”.It took a female thinker, and a feminist, to pull “patriarchy” out of the realm of theory and into the zone\u0026nbspof experience. Virginia Woolf’s Three Guineas (1938) set “patriarchy” to work on the reality of her own\u0026nbspcircumstances. For her, it described the dynamics within families like hers – in which the father held economic power and authority, boys were trained for public life and girls were debarred from either a\u0026nbspserious education or the opportunity to earn a\u0026nbspliving. The battle lines were drawn “between the victims of the patriarchal system and the patriarchs”. In other words, it was “the\u0026nbspdaughters against the fathers”.Woolf did not here write of “patriarchy” as a\u0026nbspsocial structure that went beyond the boundaries of the bourgeois household. Nor did she have time for feminine essentialism: she predicted that the opportunity for women to amass capital and property on equal terms as\u0026nbspmen would mean that women could change “from being the victims of the patriarchal system … to being the\u0026nbspchampions of the capitalist system”. She expanded: “Behind us lies the patriarchal system: the private house, with its nullity, its\u0026nbspimmorality, its hypocrisy, its servility. Before us lies the public world, the professional system, with its possessiveness, its jealousy, its pugnacity, its greed.” It is an ambiguous picture: she shows little admiration for the capitalist world she describes. And yet in her formulation – an idea that some later feminists would find themselves echoing – the “creative destruction” of capitalism had the capacity to leave patriarchy behind.In the late 1960s and early 70s, amid the ferment of revolutionary thought on the campuses of western Europe and north America, a new generation of feminist activists emerged. It was clear to them that oppression continued to bear down on women despite their increased access to the rights that Woolf’s generation fought for – access to education, the vote and the workplace. It was also obvious that existing theories of power were not equipped to explain this oppression: women had been of\u0026nbsplittle interest as subjects for economics, history and sociology, with questions of gender inequality either ignored entirely or regarded as a natural byproduct of societal development. For the feminists of the second wave, part of the work was to bring women into the light.\u0026nbspOppression could be eradicated only if it could be identified, understood and effectively treated, quite possibly with radical or revolutionary medicine.“Patriarchy” at first provided the most useful focus for\u0026nbspthis work. Kate Millett’s Sexual Politics (1970) was an early text that attempted to flesh out “patriarchy” into society’s “most fundamental concept of power”. For her, patriarchy was everywhere it was “the most pervasive ideology of our culture”. Even ordinary, apparently harmless social norms were in fact tools of oppression, according to her analysis: romantic love, for example, was simply a means of emotionally manipulating the female by the male, tricking her into subservience. Female compliance was also ensured by force – by rape. Women were socialised into pleasing, flattering, entertaining and gratifying men. Millett called the assumed birthright of\u0026nbspmale dominance “a most ingenious form of ‘interior colonisation’,” which was “sturdier than any form of segregation, and more rigorous than class stratification, more uniform, and certainly more enduring”.The feminist Rosalind Coward, author of Patriarchal Precedents: Sexuality and Social Relations (1983), one of\u0026nbspthe weightier academic tomes on the subject, recalls going to “endless conferences and meetings” in the 1970s and 80s where the idea of the patriarchy was discussed, analysed and thoroughly broken down. Her own book sets out some of the most pressing questions, not least the conundrum of where it actually came from. “Patriarchy offers itself as an account of the history of sexual relations, but at a certain point the same question has to be asked: why was it men who took control and what were the interests thus served? These questions lead back with an unerring certainty to the same isions: are there natural sexual differences in which the sexes have distinct interests? Or are sexual dispositions produced by the patriarchal structure itself?” She had hit on a problem of circular thinking in relation to patriarchy – if it had emerged from some kind of a pre-patriarchal society, then surely the patriarchy would have been required in order to produce it in the first place.“Patriarchy” sprouted dozens of reformulations and refinements as feminists attempted to theorise it into a\u0026nbspcoherent system of domination. The radical feminist Catharine MacKinnon took a hardline view: she saw patriarchy as inscribed into the very structures of the liberal state. “Men against women” was precisely the fuel that kept society, as it is currently constituted, running. By contrast, the African American feminist bell\u0026nbsphooks resisted the notion that the primary conflict in\u0026nbspsociety was one of “men against women”, which seemed inherent in radical definitions of “patriarchy”. For her, it could be simply defined as “institutionalised sexism”. In order to end it, everyone, male and female alike, must\u0026nbsp“let go of sexist thoughts and action”.Lived reality threw up problems with the concept. Experience tells us that some men are oppressed more than some women. Not all women are oppressed in the\u0026nbspsame way. Writers such as hooks pointed out that\u0026nbspfor\u0026nbspAfrican American women, the family was not necessarily the site of oppression it was for white people, representing a place of possible refuge from the traumas of white supremacy. The kind of workplaces available to many black women, too, were not of the liberating kind accessible to educated white women.Queer theorist Judith Butler critiqued MacKinnon’s universalising view of patriarchy on similar grounds, arguing that it involved “erasures” of other forms of subtle and layered oppression it was a kind of “theoretical imperialism”. Butler also sought to question the “naturalness” of gender. There were many possible categories of gendered and sexual practice, she argued, not simply the binary definitions that dominated the culture. And for psychoanalytically inclined feminist thinkers such as Jacqueline Rose, “the notion that all men are a category in opposition to all women breaks down because not all men are men,” she told me. “That is, not all men embody the kind of masculinity that men are supposed to inhabit.”The eventual rejection by many feminists of the usefulness of “patriarchy” as a fine-grained analytic concept coincided with a general diminuendo in feminist debate in the 1990s and early 2000s – a period later identified by the feminist Beatrix Campbell as a time of “neoliberal neopatriarchy”. Rapid globalisation and a culture of hyperinidualism, Campbell argued in The End of Equality (2013), had in fact led to yet more extreme forms of oppression, citing brutal conditions for labouring women in Mexico, the disproportionate number of female foetuses aborted in India and everywhere a working week “institutionalised in the interests of men unencumbered by duties of care”. While feminism had not died, during this period, it had certainly withered, she wrote.A few years earlier, in her book The Aftermath of Feminism (2008), Angela McRobbie had questioned her own initial enthusiasm for the symbols of the “third-wave feminism” of that period: Sex and the City “girl power” pole-dancing classes. In those days, to throw around the word “patriarchy” – when many people assumed that moral and economic progress were destined to eradicate inequality – would have seemed eccentric, misguided or plain mad. Women, or so it seemed, had never had it so good.Patriarchy is nimble and lithe. Its margins of operation always seem to be expanding. Feminists have naturally tended to\u0026nbsparrange their battle lines in front of the aspect of\u0026nbspoppression that they have regarded as the most pressing. If “patriarchy” has returned as an idea in public debate, it\u0026nbspis because feminism has returned with renewed vigour because inequality has not been eradicated.In 1990, the feminist Sylvia Walby crisply laid out six areas of patriarchal oppression in her book Theorizing Patriarchy they still seem to be ticking along nicely. In the home, women still do most of the domestic labour. In the workplace, a legal right to equal pay has not resulted in the eradication of the gender pay gap. At the level of the state, women are underrepresented nearly everywhere in the world in parliaments, legislatures, the military and other bodies. In terms of male violence, the charity Rape Crisis estimates that in Britain, 11 rapes are carried out or attempted every hour of every day. Women and men are still judged differently when it comes to sex. And the “patriarchal gaze” is still strong in education, religion, culture and the media. And so, for feminists right now, the uses of “patriarchy” are greater than its analytic flaws it allows feminists to perceive the gap between the status quo and what they would like to achieve. “If patriarchy weren’t effective, we wouldn’t need feminism if it were totally effective, we wouldn’t have feminism,” Jacqueline Rose told me.Feminists of an older generation note that the popular revival of “patriarchy” has not (yet) been accompanied by the intense debate and academic theorising that flowered around it the 1970s. It is a slogan and a popular rallying cry rather than an analytic tool. “What I don’t like about it,” said Mary Beard, “is that it is convenient and simple. I don’t really like ‘misogyny’ either, for the same reason. It’s no more a tangible ‘thing’ than capitalism. Saying ‘crush the patriarchy’ has a nice ring, but it doesn’t contain any political analysis.”While it is true that lots of intangible things are pressed into service as useful abstractions for helping us understand the world, some feminists still worry that “patriarchy” is in danger of being oversimplified in the course of being co-opted into public debate. “It is now seemingly used almost interchangeably with sexism,” Rosalind Coward said, “and it certainly doesn’t seem to be accompanied by a discussion about where it came from.” Jacqueline Rose told me: “It’s used as a call-out phrase, as if it explained everything. It’s fine to use it as a tool, as long as you don’t mistake it for a complete description of how the world is organised.”But then, perhaps the revival of “patriarchy” is a\u0026nbspbellwether for today’s feminism, which is presently more concerned with action than theory. The concept has survived its biggest theoretical challenge – that of intersectionality, which argues that “patriarchy” universalises and oversimplifies the subtle realities of oppression – because it offers a description of the world that many people recognise, and that unites the many people who want to fight against it. It is particularly suited to today’s fast-moving, hyper-connected digital feminism, where immediate, personal connections can be made in an instant between feminists across the world and radicalising work done in a moment.“Patriarchy” is also deeply energising to those who use it. There is a certain relief in giving a name to the affliction. It has a\u0026nbspsatisfying ring of old-fashioned radicalism about it,\u0026nbspand it comes with a sharp flavouring of conflict. “Patriarchy” is a battle cry. That is not surprising: the internet has enabled the rapid expansion of feminist campaigning, but also the deep and sometimes violent radicalisation of those\u0026nbspwho fear and hate it. A reaction against the new feminism has arrived almost simultaneously, as the discontents of disgruntled and unsettled men are stirred and stoked online, in the so-called manosphere. Cynical politicians crusading against “political correctness”, such as Trump, have fed off this baleful energy. In this clamorous world, “patriarchy” has become “the patriarchy”, a further simplification that makes it seem even more crude and concrete – less of an invisible mechanism, more of a statue to be smashed.One might reasonably ask whether the patriarchy is truly in any danger, as Steve Bannon fears. It is easier to topple patriarchs, as Susan Faludi pointed out in the wake of Weinstein, than patriarchy. Powerful men who have been called out by #MeToo have left the room, but the room itself still looks very much the same. (Some of the men, too, look very much as if they will be returning to the room quite soon.) If anything can\u0026nbspunravel “the rule of the father”, it is likely to be the gradual shift in the way gender and sexuality are being understood. New ways of bringing up children outside traditional family structures will chip away at it. So will the rising generation of bold young feminists who have not internalised oppression like their elders, and who are calling out sexism and misogyny where they see it.But Bannon can relax. As Mary Beard said recently: “Patriarchy has had several thousand years of practice – of course it’s good at it. It’s very good at bolstering its own sexist values.” If a horde of angry leading women did take a guillotine to the testicles of Harvey Weinstein, patriarchy would survive. The word “patriarchy” ought to be a reminder that Weinstein and his ilk are the symptom, not the disease – but it is easier to tackle iniduals than structures, signs rather than causes.At the moment – although the picture varies wildly across the globe – feminists are increasingly using the tool of “patriarchy” to\u0026nbsprecognise the subtle depth of the forces that keep oppression in place, from the expectations about the behaviour of women in the workplace to the way they are portrayed in fiction. It will be harder to unravel the effect of this cultural inheritance than it was to get the vote. As Max Weber observed, it is the very longevity of patriarchal traditions and norms that serve to prop it up – “the belief in the inviolability of that which has existed from time out of mind”. The eradication of patriarchy looks like a task of enormous complexity when it is smashed, it will take a lot down with it. And so the patriarchs – from the bully in the White House to the bully in your workplace – are still in charge.

As the clock to Brexit ticks down, we must prepare for every eventuality, including no deal. This is neither a desired nor a likely outcome. But it is not an impossible one. And we are getting ready just in case.“We will use all the tools at our disposal, which could have a cushioning impact. The new long-term budget for our union from 2021 onwards has an in-built flexibility that could allow us to redirect funds if the situation arose.“We will also earmark €120m (£105m) for a new peace programme which has done so much in breaking down barriers between communities in Northern Ireland and the border counties.”Juncker has put Martin Selmayr, the commission president’s former chief of staff, who is now the European commission’s secretary-general, in charge of preparations for a no-deal scenario.Selmayr has drawn up a series of legislative changes that would be needed in the event of the UK crashing out. He has even raised the unlikely prospect of requiring UK citizens to apply for a visa to visit EU member states.A senior UK government source warned that a no-deal outcome would only suit the Russian president, Vladimir Putin. “If we were, God forbid, to get into the situation where you had a sour orce and an acrimonious future relationship, I don’t think that does any good for anybody,” the source said. “That’s a complete lose-lose situation. “The only people who’d have a smile on their faces are people in the Kremlin and elsewhere who wish European democracies ill.”To avoid a border both on the island of Ireland and in the Irish sea, the British government has so far proposed that the UK as a whole effectively stays in the customs union for a limited period after Brexit, until a technological solution to the border issue emerges.It is expected to further propose after next week’s summit of leaders in Brussels that the UK remains in regulatory alignment with the EU on goods, to ensure all border checks are unnecessary.Juncker, however, told the Irish parliament the EU would not allow the UK to use the Irish issue to gain single market access without freedom of movement and membership of the full ecosystem of the bloc’s institutions, including the European court of justice.He said: “Our backstop is a bespoke and workable solution. It is designed for Northern Ireland and upholds its constitutional status.“But this tailored solution for Northern Ireland cannot fit the whole United Kingdom. It covers all necessary customs and regulatory controls to avoid a hard border. And it does not prejudice the future relationship between the UK and the European Union.“With less than 10 months to Brexit, we need more answers and fewer new questions. We will continue – my friend Michel Barnier, myself and others – to take a pragmatic approach to finding solutions. But I also want to be clear: Ireland will come first.“There are those who think that the other 26 countries will abandon Ireland at the last minute for a sectoral deal that suits them. Those people have not understood what being part of our union means. Ireland’s border is Europe’s border – and it is our union’s priority.”A senior UK cabinet source claimed the EU’s proposal failed to address the concerns of nationalist and unionist communities. “There have been some serious questions about what we have put on the table but it has not been rejected,” the source said. “What is absolutely essential is that the approach that is agreed is demonstrably balanced and fair to both communities in Northern Ireland. No solution is going to ensure if it is going to be rejected by one community or the other.”Varadkar, at a press conference with Juncker, said he believed there was an “urgent need to intensify efforts” in order to achieve a withdrawal agreement."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5e8bd3d15228ed51b6bb83228aebd4b0b4fa3f40/0_2_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=76c25b24ca64a77b7681a15ff64a2b01","title":"face of the modern tory party sajid javid tipped for the top","story":"He is a rising star who appeals to left and right, though things can change quickly in his current jobThe contenders: who could replace Theresa May?‘He is the great survivor’: Jeremy Hunt’s ascendancyWhen Sajid Javid was photographed apparently striking a “power pose” outside the Home Office on his first day as home secretary, he set the Conservative party alight with speculation that he was aiming for the top job.The stance, a favourite of Tory heavyweights including Theresa May and George Osborne, had become synonymous with thrusting ambition. Along with his elevation to a senior post, it propelled him to the top of the party leadership rankings.It later transpired he had been tricked by photographers who asked him to take a step forward and captured him mid-adjustment. But it is at such moments that leadership campaigns are conceived. Days later a ConservativeHome poll of party members put him third in the race to succeed the prime minister.Those closest to Javid have tried, with limited degrees of success, to dampen down the rumours. One friend told the : “We know more than anyone from experience that things can change. There is no point in trying to bank that and believe all the hype.“Amber Rudd was supposed to be the great white hope for a lot of people, and look how that ended up. In that department, if you’re not keeping an eye on the job at hand it can all go horribly wrong.”When David Cameron stood down in 2016, Javid launched a joint leadership bid with the then work and pensions secretary, Stephen Crabb, which would have made him chancellor to Crabb’s prime minister. The pair billed themselves as “blue collar” Conservatives, in contrast to rivals such as Boris Johnson, but their campaign had barely begun when they withdrew, and Javid threw his weight behind May.Javid, 48, has a backstory many politicians would give their right arm for. His father, Abdul, arrived from Pakistan in 1961with a £1 note in his pocket and settled in Rochdale, where he worked as a bus conductor. The family moved to Bristol where Javid’s parents eventually opened a shop. A career adviser at Javid’s comprehensive school suggested he become a TV repair man, advice he ignored by applying to study economics and politics at Exeter and then embarking on a successful banking career. He was eventually headhunted by Deustche Bank on a reported salary – which he has never denied – of £3m.His political rise has been swift. Osborne identified him as a potential star and brought him into the Treasury. He was promoted to the cabinet in 2014 as culture secretary and moved to business the following year. May moved him to communities – at the time considered a demotion – where he dealt with the aftermath of the Grenfell Tower disaster.His appointment as home secretary came as a surprise to many as Javid and the prime minister had not always seen eye to eye. But from the off he was his own man, and he appears to have got away with it. In his first statement to the Commons he disowned May’s “hostile environment” policy on immigration, which had led to the Windrush scandal, and in the six weeks that followed he made peace with the Police Federation, lifted the immigration cap for NHS doctors and nurses, and announced a review of medicinal cannabis oil – 24 hours after May had rejected the idea. Whitehall officials say Javid is a pragmatist who is unafraid of telling his boss she is wrong. One said: “He has a great advantage in that he has been a big decision-maker in private life, he is terribly energetic and doesn’t take no for an answer. If there’s a problem he wants to deal with it.” Tory insiders believe a British Asian prime minister – the first – could be a great electoral asset, especially one who believes in free markets. “The left of the party loves him because of who he is the right do too because of his fiscal views,” said one cabinet minister. “He’s the face of the modern Tory party,” one MP added.Javid has always embraced his ersity but does not want it to define him. “I don’t think of myself as an Asian-background politician, I think of myself as a politician,” he has said. Even some Labour politicians offer warm words. Sadiq Khan, the London mayor, told the : “Saj hasn’t forgotten his roots or his heritage. It’s a testament to his family and his work ethic that he has broken through the glass ceiling.”In a party deeply ided by Brexit, Javid’s position as a reluctant remainer would just about keep both sides happy. “You don’t have to think we absolutely must be out of the European Union to slightly worry about where this is going,” said one ally.Several cabinet colleagues are impressed. One minister admitted: “I am a fan. He has been nice and punchy. Question is, is he brave enough? I don’t know the answer to that.” But Javid is unlikely to challenge May directly. “He’s very loyal,” one Tory MP said. “He’s not a plotter.”Nickie Aiken, the Tory leader of Westminster council and an old university friend of Javid’s, said: “I certainly think he could go all the way if that’s what he wanted, but at the moment he’s concentrating on the Home Office.”When the inevitable contest does take place, there is likely to be a crowded field of candidates. Jeremy Hunt, the health secretary, has also been tipped for the top. A cabinet minister told the : “Of the two, there is only one that has got what it takes and that’s Sajid. He’s nailing it at the Home Office.”But not everybody is enamoured. A Tory MP said: “Anybody who thinks Sajid is a runner has clearly never heard him speak. He’s wooden, he can’t connect with a crowd.” Some of his early TV and despatch box appearances elicited grimaces from colleagues. At the Home Office he will either sink or swim. A growing number in the party think it will be the latter. After he was appointed, a Twitter meme appeared featuring the 1992 Tory election poster. “What does the Conservative party offer a working-class kid from Brixton? They made him prime minister.” Javid’s picture replaced that of John Major.

The news is the culmination of a two-year effort by Ascot in combination with Longines, one of its long-standing business partners, aimed at making the venue a showcase which other major tracks around the world will seek to emulate.Racegoers and punters in other countries have long taken for granted a detailed breakdown of the times run by inidual racehorses in each race but British racing has lagged behind and the subject has become a bone of contention. Advocates of sectional times, which record how long a horse took to run each furlong in a race, say they help to deepen understanding of why a race developed as it did and thereby stimulate interest, potentially leading to bigger TV audiences and improved betting turnover.“I think it’s really exciting,” said Juliet Slot, Ascot’s commercial director, whose aim is to have furlong-by-furlong times being shown on screen during TV coverage of Ascot’s most prestigious race of the year, the King George VI \u0026amp Queen Elizabeth Stakes, to be run at the end of next month. “It’ll provide us with a whole raft of data which hopefully we can share with our customers and other stakeholders in due course.“Initially, it’s just showing the order and the sectional times for each furlong but we will have further data. What we want to do is start and then improve it.“Longines want Ascot to be a showcase venue for the technology which then in due course will hopefully bring other racecourses from around the world to see how it works. We own the data and what we do with the data will depend on working with different partners as to how useful it will be. The obvious thing to look at is our betting partners and how they could use sectional timing. We want to get it live, get it working, see what the information is and then see what they think.”Eventually, the data could be used to create a real-time visual representation of a race while it is in progress. The technology apparently exists but Ascot wants to consider how such a thing might best be presented and delivered.The available data will eventually include the precise route taken by each horse in a race and the amount of ground it covered. The traditional heated debates about whether or not a particular horse was unlucky will at last have some solid evidence as an aid to discussion.“Ascot’s initiative is welcome, if long overdue, though the care taken to get the technology right is to be commended,” said the form and time analyst Simon Rowlands, who has represented the interests of punters through the Horseracing Bettors Forum. “Sectional times have long been seen as crucial for analysis and understanding in other racing jurisdictions, and interest in them in Britain has increased greatly as a result of their existence at a small number of courses and through the efforts of racing enthusiasts.“The ideal future would see free and readily available sectionals provided at all courses, live as well as after the event, and put properly into context. It is to be hoped that British racing more widely finally embraces this concept for the good of the sport.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3948d2e0d3dee06517565cc2e95736b8214e68f6/0_79_4170_2503/master/4170.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f39f3e32fb337b86c6c61a8d607709c0","title":"nba draft picks phoenix deandre ayton","story":"The Phoenix Suns stayed close to home for their first No 1 pick. The Dallas Mavericks looked all the way to Slovenia for the player they hope can be their next European superstar.Shortly after the Suns took Deandre Ayton to start the NBA draft on Thursday night, the Mavericks traded up two spots for the rights to Luka Doncic.The Atlanta Hawks swapped the rights to Doncic, the No 3 pick who has spent the last year winning championships all over Europe, to Atlanta for Trae Young, the No 5 selection from Oklahoma.The Mavericks also gave up a future first-round pick to draft Doncic, who only arrived in New York on Wednesday after helping Spain’s Real Madrid win its league championship after he won Euroleague MVP and Final Four MVP honors when they won that title this year.His lengthy European season kept him from working out for teams but he knew the Mavericks were interested in having him on their team for what’s expected to be Dirk Nowitzki’s final NBA season.“I’ve been talking to Dallas a lot. They really wanted me, and they were very, very nice,” the 19-year-old said. “They were very nice to me, and I think we had a very good relationship.”The Hawks will get perhaps the most exciting player in college basketball last season in Young, the first player to lead the nation in scoring and assists in the same season.“Whatever city I went to, I was going to be able to be comfortable in,” said Young, who wore suit shorts with his burgundy-colored jacket. “I was just really excited to get to Atlanta.”After that, it was a mostly straightforward draft with little fireworks, but plenty of national champion Villanova Wildcats.The top of it was dominated by big men, starting with a pair of former high school teammates.The Suns made the 7ft 1in Ayton the first No 1 pick in franchise history. The center from Arizona averaged 20.1 points and 11.6 rebounds in his lone season in Tucson, tying for the national lead with 24 double-doubles in 35 games.He joined Mychal Thompson – father of Golden State All-Star Klay Thompson – in 1978 as the only players from the Bahamas to be the No 1 pick in the NBA draft.“Having my name called to be the first pick for the Phoenix Suns was mind-blowing,” Ayton said. “Having all that confidence and leading up to that point when I saw Adam Silver came out, I was just waiting for my name, and when he called it, my mind went blank.”The Sacramento Kings followed by taking Marvin Bagley III, the Duke big man who played with Ayton at Hillcrest Prep Academy in Phoenix in 2015-16.With Michigan State’s Jaren Jackson Jr. going fourth to Memphis, Texas center Mo Bamba going No 6 to Orlando and Wendell Carter Jr following to Chicago, it was an early run of big men in what’s increasingly become a perimeter-based league.Then it was another guard with Alabama’s Collin Sexton going at No 8 to Cleveland, triggering chants of Michael Porter Jr’s name by Knicks fans who hoped they would take him with the No 9 pick. But they ended up disappointed as New York went with Kentucky’s Kevin Knox.“They booed (Kristaps) Porzingis (on draft night) and look where he is now. That’s the same mindset I’m going to have,” Knox said. “They can chant Michael Porter all they want. But they got Kevin Knox, and I’m willing to work and I’m willing to get better.”With concerns over back problems that limited him to only three games at Missouri last season, followed by a recent hip injury that he believe scared off teams, Porter ended up falling all the way to Denver at No 14, the last lottery position.There were a couple other trades involving lottery picks. Mikal Bridges, the No 10 pick from Villanova who thought he was staying in Philadelphia with the 76ers – who employ his mother – but was dealt to Phoenix for the rights to No 16 pick Zhaire Smith of Texas Tech and a 2012 first-round pick from the Miami Heat.The Charlotte Hornets sent the rights to No 11 pick Shai Gilgeous-Alexander – whose floral-patterned suit stood out among the selections – to the Clippers for No 12 pick Miles Bridges and two future second-round picks.After Bridges, Final Four Most Outstanding Player Donte DiVincenzo went to Milwaukee at No 17 and Omari Spellman to Atlanta at No 30, giving Villanova three first-round picks for the first time. National player of the year Jalen Brunson then was picked by Dallas with the third pick of the second round.The Holiday brothers had an NBA reunion when Aaron Holiday was taken at No 23 by Indiana. Brothers Jrue and Justin already play in the league.Speaking of brothers, Kostas Antetokounmpo of Dayton, brother of Bucks All-Star Giannis Antetokounmpo, was the 60th and final pick by Philadelphia. That marked the first time three international siblings were drafted into the NBA, as Thanasis Antetokounmpo was the No 51 pick in 2014."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a98a480f01d203717bab4e1d13ff4e3d6d7e080f/0_198_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e368c7e2cfabb65d66db1d0d805a84db","title":"team sky coach defence chris froome tour de france","story":"Tim Kerrison, Chris Froome’s long-term coach, has attacked the growing criticism in the French media towards the Team Sky rider in the buildup to this year’s Tour de France following the latest attack on Froome from the retired five-times Tour winner Bernard Hinault.“If things are presented in a way that incites or sensationalises, or fuels anger or resentment towards Chris, then I don’t think that’s very responsible,” Kerrison said. “I think fair treatment in the media is a responsible requirement to ensure the riders’ safety.”Hinault, who as the Tour’s master of ceremonies spent many years shaking Froome warmly by the hand as he presented him with the race leader’s yellow jersey, suggested that his peers should strike if the defending champion starts this year’s race, which begins in the Vendée on 7 July.“The peloton is too nice,” Hinault told French media of the controversy of Froome’s adverse analytical finding (AAF) for salbutamol. “Others have been sanctioned, but they won’t sanction him because they say it was an abnormal control? It’s banned and that’s it. The rules are the same for\u0026nbspeverybody.”Speaking to the  in Monaco, Kerrison, the performance guru behind Froome’s startling victory in last month’s Giro d’Italia, is adamant that the continuing scepticism towards Froome, further fuelled by his still unresolved AAF, is\u0026nbspunfounded.“I’m very confident that he is innocent,” the Australian said. “There have never been any question marks for me.”Team Sky also issued a statement on Thursday morning, describing Hinault’s comments as “disappointing”, “factually incorrect” and “irresponsible and ill-informed”.Froome has had a bodyguard for some time but Kerrison admits Team Sky’s staff and riders are steeling themselves for a potentially hostile reception when the Tour begins.“We have been talking for a long time about safety and security and we had a couple of BSkyB’s security team come to spend time with us, just to advise us on how we operate and can improve our safety and security at races.“Our experience of riding in France and our experience of the public has been fantastic. But we also know there will also be a small part of the crowd who will be hostile and a few people who are haters and are particularly hostile. “But you can address the core problem as well, which is the way some things are presented in particular sections of the media.”With Froome and his team reputedly locked in combat with the World Anti-Doping Agency over the viability of the salbutamol finding and ASO, the promoter of the Tour de France, watching from the sidelines, there is now almost no chance of the stalemate surrounding Froome being resolved before the start of the 2018 Tour. That leaves Froome free to race, yet even Kerrison bemoaned the current impasse. “Guilty or innocent, it shouldn’t take this long to resolve,” Kerrison said. “If he’s found to be innocent it just shouldn’t take the months and months that it has done to resolve the situation.”The scepticism that has followed Froome and his performances since his first Tour win in 2013 became a runaway train this spring following the publication of the parliamentary report by the digital, culture, media and sport select committee into anti-doping, which questioned the credibility of the team principal, Dave Brailsford, attacked the team’s medical record keeping and labelled their use of therapeutic use exemptions unethical.Then came an extraordinary Giro d’Italia, in which Froome reversed a disastrous start to the three‑week tour with a race-winning ride through the Italian Alps that left his peers stunned and his detractors incensed.“We have never seen a ride like that from him in a race,” acknowledged Kerrison of Froome’s lone attack over the gravel ascent of the Colle delle Finestre that took him decisively into the race lead.“Ultimately it was Chris’s idea to do that. He knew the Finestre climb and despite what people say about his bike handling skills, they’re actually pretty good and he doesn’t mind a bit of dirt road. We could see some cracks among the opponents. We knew the climb and we knew that if they cracked on it, that they could lose a lot of time.”Froome’s performance polarised cycling and the reaction encapsulated why the sport continues to battle for credibility. Kerrison, meanwhile, is developing a deck of detailed information aimed at persuading sceptics that Froome’s ride was credible.“Other than trying to help to inform and understand what went into that performance there’s only so much we can do. But I can absolutely guarantee that there was no illegal performance enhancement,” he said.“We want to be working with some of the world’s best athletes and trying to make them better. We want to break into new territory with them, so incredible and unbelievable are the kind of words that I am proud to hear people use.”Yet Kerrison knows that such language has a double edge. “It definitely does. We’re well aware of the history and that people have trouble believing what they’re seeing at times. I think it’s not unreasonable for people to question what they’re seeing.“But I know that the whole peloton is riding faster than it was a couple of years ago. From what I can see in the data we have and the climb rates, if our riders don’t continue to improve they will be overtaken by the next generation of young riders.“We are nowhere near the limits of human capability. A lot of the performances from a decade ago were enhanced but they were also neglected in other ways. Resources were spent in one area and not in legitimate performance enhancement. Now they are.“My objective is to keep us ahead of the curve. I know that the performances we’re doing now aren’t going to cut it in two or three years’ time. There is a constant evolution in performance, with equipment, engineering, our knowledge of physiology, how to get the best through training and\u0026nbspnutrition.”After winning six Grand Tours, Froome, now training in the French Alps at the Isola 2000 ski resort before heading to the Tour’s Grand Départ, has developed a thick skin, but the suggestion that he now seems almost immune to scepticism brings a sharp response from Kerrison. “That doesn’t make it right though,” he said. “Chris is human and it’s only natural that he feels a sense of injustice over the way he’s been treated or reported. But when it’s time to focus on his performance, he’s uniquely good at putting all that to one side and delivering.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/89f644631e031c3ecb4d639a9ad7e2a08afda651/387_317_3757_2255/master/3757.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9cc2bdaa4024fbae18ae230e8a140473","title":"glastonbury town festival druids pagans travel holidays","story":"What’s Glastonbury like without the bands and the fans? As the festival takes a year off, it turns out there’s still plenty to enjoy, from ethical taxidermy to wall-to-wall druids‘Summer here is something to behold,” says Kevin Mitchell from behind the counter of Knight’s, his chippy on Glastonbury’s Northload Street. “Hippies, druids, goddesses in their finery, people dressed as elves: you never know who – or what – is going to walk through the door.”Knight’s has been run by the same family on the same site since 1909, although the building itself is medieval, constructed from stone taken from Glastonbury Abbey after it was sacked by Henry VIII. If that stone could talk, it would tell of a town much changed from its roots as a place of Christian pilgrimage to its present reality as the new-age capital of England.That transformation doubtless has much to do with the establishment in 1970 of the Glastonbury festival, seven miles to the east of Glastonbury proper. In a typical June, 135,000 music fans will spend the weekend at Michael Eavis’s farm near the village of Piltdown. But Glastonbury’s 9,000 full-time inhabitants represent more than 70 faith groups, and the town has forged a resilient identity of its own.“Some people would dearly love Glastonbury to have stayed the old market town of 40, 50 years ago,” says Mitchell, “but we have survived by embracing the multicultural, multi-faith society. So long as they eat fish and chips, I don’t care.”This being one of the so-called “fallow” years in which the festival has a break to allow the land to recover, it seems a good opportunity to focus on the town from which it takes its name. So what is Glastonbury like without Glasto?To find out, I visit on May Day. This is the gleaming hinge of the Glastonbury year, celebrated as Beltane by the town’s many pagans. On this day, the character of the place is the same as always – small-town mundanity rubbing up against exuberant weirdness – but a little more intense. Put it this way: in a Glastonbury cafe you’re never far from someone in a mistletoe crown eating a full English, but on May Day they might add an extra sausage.It’s a full moon, and the early-morning drive over the Somerset Levels reveals a daguerreotype landscape in silver light. I can just make out the dark mass of my destination: Glastonbury Tor, the steep hill topped by a 15th-century tower that stands as a symbol of the town. For each of the last 30 years, 1 May has been marked by a druidic ceremony on the summit.“The druids are always falling out with each other,” I had been warned by Vicki Steward, who writes Normal For Glastonbury, a blog that takes an affectionate view of the town’s Monty Pythonesque qualities. “There are various druid groups including the OBOD (Order of Bards, Ovates and Druids) the BDO (British Druid Order), GOD (Glastonbury Order of Druids) and then there are the Loyal Arthurian Warband. It’s all a bit People’s Front of Judea.”In fact, the occasion is remarkably collegiate: pipers, folk singers, morris dancers, all welcoming the dawn in their own way. The view is so stunning as to be unphotographable even one’s eyes aren’t quite up to the job.Rollo Maughfling, archdruid of Britain, leads the ceremony, calling for peace at all points of the compass, the light climbing little by little to reveal his white robe, red cloak, white beard and, finally, cricket umpire-ish hat. He blows a brass hunting horn in fanfare to the risen sun.By 7am, it is shining golden down the High Street. Glastonbury has few chain stores instead independent shops with colourful fronts give the impression that little has changed since yesteryear, until one looks closer at the displays – healing crystals, wands and cauldrons, incense, tarot cards, and accessories “for the discerning witch”. On Church Lane, an American visitor peers at a pair of stuffed magpies in the window of a shop offering “ethically sourced taxidermy” and declares that it reminds her of the “vegan lapdancing club” back home in Portland, Oregon.Glastonbury is the antithesis of a clone town, which comes with its own challenges. “It’s actually very difficult to buy an ordinary pair of trousers,” says Jamie George, co-owner of Gothic Image, which was, back in 1979, the first “alternative” shop here. “But you can go to the neighbouring village for that.”Outside the Lazy Gecko Cafe, a busker is singing a song from the 13th century: “Summer is icumen in …” A woman with plums in her vowels and flowers in her hair tells a new acquaintance, “Find me on Insta, dah-ling …” There is a strong sense of the centuries swirling together. There is something in the air, and not the obvious. Though Glastonbury seems to run on mead and weed, its hedonism feels rooted in something authentically numinous.One can sense this quality at the abbey. It has that mingled sadness and peace often found in ruined churches. A white dove flies through Romanesque arches, and nothing now remains of the high altar but a stone border within which irreverent dandelions refuse to bow their heads. Yet what still stands is grand and beautiful. “For a thousand years Glastonbury was the most spectacular abbey in Christendom,” says Jon Cousins, the town’s former mayor. “It was so important that in Italy they called it Roma Secunda, the Second Rome. God knows why Geoffrey Chaucer wrote about that other place.”Like many who visit and settle in Glastonbury, Cousins felt “called” there. You hear this a lot: that the town and landscape has some sort of siren presence. To help this sort of visitor, the tourist information office features a “pilgrim reception centre”, which directs “spiritual seekers” to whatever they might need, be it a Christian shrine or a Wiccan ritual. “Someone might stagger in here and say they’ve just seen Archangel Michael on the Tor,” says the centre’s founder, Morgana West. “Glastonbury has an effect on people. But we are non-judgmental.”Back out on Magdalene Street, the 376 bus to Bristol is being held up by a maypole in the road. “Blessings be for public transport,” calls a man with a green face and top hat, soothingly, to the driver. This is the Beltane procession through town.There are hundreds following, among them the Reverend Diana Greenfield, AKA “the goth vicar”, whose dog collar peeps over an elaborate mantle of leather and fur. This servant of the Church of England is strolling companionably alongside Tracy, a woman in full paganish fig – an antlered headdress wound around with ivy. Tracy is walking Oakley, a wirehaired vizsla the Rev has her own pet, Cara the collie, on a lead. It’s a very Glastonbury, very British scene, the bonds of dog ownership being more important than differences in faith.We all climb the hill to Bushy Coombe, a green field overlooking the town. There, amid drumming and ululation, the maypole is erected. Green ribbons shimmer as people dance around. Some wag mentions the Wicker Man, of course, but that’s not quite right. Today feels more like a celebration of the community and its twin values: open mind and open heart.At around 3pm, as the last ribbon tightens around the pole, the sun disappears behind a bank of cloud and a gentle drizzle begins to fall. The ritual, it appears, has worked – dull and damp, the English summer truly is icumen in.Where to stayThe Sheppey Inn is a well-regarded pub and restaurant with three en-suite rooms (£100-£120 a night) and two nearby cottages (£130 and £140 a night). Out in the wilds of the Somerset Levels, four miles from Glastonbury, it offers welcome perspective on the town. The highly Instagrammable bar, decorated with vintage toys and stuffed animals, carries an enticing selection of cocktails and local scrumpy. “We’ve tried to create a place that is true to where it is,” says owner Mark Hey, “so it feels like a giant cider barn full of weirdness.”Where to eat and drinkHundred Monkeys is an organic cafe and bakery that does a mean veggie breakfast. The Rainbows End was Glastonbury’s first vegetarian cafe over the decades it has managed to perfect the vegan chocolate brownie. The George and Pilgrims’ is about as old as English inns get, slaking thirsts when the abbey was still a going concern, and should satisfy connoisseurs of low beams, nooks and crannies. Alternatively, the King Arthur has the town’s biggest beer garden, a sun trap full of dogs, kids and dudes with dreadlocks.What to seeGlastonbury has two natural springs. The Chalice Well (£4.40 adults, £2.20 children) is associated with the legend that this is where Joseph of Arimathea buried or washed the Holy Grail, the cup used at the last supper, and therefore that the waters (which visitors can drink they taste of iron) represent the blood of Christ. The nearby White Spring, free to enter, is a former Victorian pump-house. Repurposed as a temple, its candle-lit vaults echo with running water. A sign on the door forbids cameras and phones, warns visitors about the presence of “faerie portals”, and signals that naked bathing is acceptable.• Accommodation was provided by the Sheppey Inn"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/462de6bcf702bde8afd803db3bdd794745b5a24e/85_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f501e9b74ae0d96aba7184e610ac7d63","title":"from the futureworld conspiracy to bt the best westworld fan theories","story":"In the build up to the series two finale we look at the best – and most outlandish – theories from the messageboards When the dust settles after this weekend’s Westworld season two finale, the only thing certain is that there will be intense debate among the faithful. Crafted by its creators Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy to be an experience like no other, Westworld’s flourishing mythology is in its DNA. Themes of identity, agency and morality inevitably lend themselves to fervent theorising. The fan base cracked most of season one’s big twists far in advance, so ahead of The Passenger (which is simulcast on Sky Atlantic early on Monday morning and repeated at 10pm the same night), we look at the six best theories currently circulating among the Westworld fandom. In Futureworld, the 1976 sequel to the Westworld movie, Delos create near-perfect replicas of the world elites who visit the park, in the hope of infiltrating the one percent with automated sleeper agents under their control. It has been speculated this could happen in the TV show. It would be exactly the kind of psychotic robot espionage we have come to expect from Delos. Are we really saying, however, that the public could not discern their leaders from a bunch of power-crazed androids controlled by a faceless corporation? Beyond it being huge, unforgiving and having that authentic frontier air about it, we know very little of Westworld’s location. Early on, the clever money was on Westworld being out of this world, maybe on a satellite, perhaps even on Mars. Over time, though, fans have honed in on the Far East as the location, most likely close to China. The Delos soldiers who come to take back the park from the hosts speak Chinese and have uniforms looking very much like those of the People’s Liberation Army. Perhaps taking their cue from the Firefly universe, China and the US are the two big superpowers of the future.It has always been difficult to get a handle on Westworld’s creative maverick Robert Ford. Equal parts storyteller and metaphysical prankster, he delights in pulling the rug from under us and confounding our expectations. But maybe he showed his hand in this season’s fourth episode, The Riddle of the Sphinx. The theory runs that the Riddle of the Sphinx is the heart of the real motivation behind Westworld. The ancient parable on the inevitability of ageing reveals what has been staring at us all along, according to Reddit. “The Delos Experiment is trying to create a true host-human hybrid – a baby host who will age and grow up,” says user Seize-The-Meanies. It definitely has a certain elegance to it and it would hardly be the first time man and machine ended up breeding to create a new beginning.As if the issue of identity wasn’t fraught enough, the possibility emerges that Westworld’s host Head of Programming has been taken over by conflicted gunslinger Teddy. For the first time in season two we see the core control units of the hosts, spherical objects known as pearls. They are removable and therefore perhaps transferable, like game cartridges. Bernard’s strange behaviour in the immediate aftermath of the gala massacre timeline and his “I killed them – all of them” confession in the weeks later timeline suggests to some that the later Bernard is not Bernard at all. He dresses rather like Teddy and we get a flash of him looking down at his white hands on Teddy’s train to Sweetwater in the season two primer. The nub of it is that something happened between these two timelines to turn Bernard into Teddy. It would be exactly the kind of switcheroo Westworld loves to pull off. This one has legs. You will no doubt have heard the scurrilous gossip that the Man in Black is a host, but that is frankly yesterday’s news. Hot off the press after the events of episode nine comes the theory that he has, in fact, lost his mind. William’s journey from white hat to black hat may be the most tragic of all the Westworld character arcs. It would be enough to drive anyone mad and the glimpse we get in the episode of his character profile reveals him as a persecutory and paranoid subtype, suffering from delusions. His Dolores hallucination at the party adds weight to the theory. That the murdering sex offender has mental health issues is not in itself a big reveal, but casting doubt on his reliability as a narrator has big implications for the rest of the Westworld universe. How much of his interaction with Robert Ford is really just in his head? The FlashForward kangaroo was just a kangaroo and the Lost polar bear was just a big dumb bear but maybe finally we have a rogue animal with some symbolic significance. The Westworld white wolf mainly appears in the flashbacks of Dolores and Teddy, typically cantering its way through a street littered with bodies. Reddit Philosophers have intriguingly suggested that the wolf represents sentience and is only visible to those who have attained consciousness. Even more seductive, though, is the theory that the wolf is Nymeria, one of the Winterfell direwolves from Game of Thrones. The prospect of a Marvel-style HBO universe throws up endless possibilities. If winter is coming, maybe Omar’s coming too?

So far no African country had agreed to host screening centres, he confirmed. “It has to be discussed with these countries, he said. “An official proposal has not been put on the table.”The idea for offshore migrant processing centres remains sketchy, with numerous political, practical and legal questions unanswered. It remains unclear, for example, whether migrants on a rescue ship in European waters could be returned to a north African country.Tahar Cherif, the Tunisian ambassador to the EU said: “The proposal was put to the head of our government a few months ago during a visit to Germany, it was also asked by Italy, and the answer is clear: no!“We have neither the capacity nor the means to organise these detention centres. We are already suffering a lot from what is happening in Libya, which has been the effect of European action.”He said his country was facing enough problems with unemployment, without wishing to add to them while Niger said its existing centres taking migrants out of detention camps in Libya are already full.The idea for the centres was thrown into the mix of EU migration policy before a series of crucial summits on migration in the next week.About 10 EU leaders will meet in Brussels on Sunday in a hastily convened emergency meeting aimed at preventing the collapse of the German coalition government.But the Italian government has been angered by draft conclusions for the summit, which stress the need to counter “secondary movements” – an issue that affects Germany. Under EU rules, a member state usually has responsibility for asylum seekers who have arrived in its territory, a regulation that has put frontline states Italy and Greece under huge pressure.But claimants often move to a second EU state, seeking a faster decision or to unite with family members.So-called “secondary movements” is the issue driving a wedge between Germany’s ruling coalition. The Bavarian CSU party has set the chancellor, Angela Merkel, a deadline of two weeks to find a solution. The interior minister, Horst Seehofer, has threatened to send away migrants at the border – a breach of EU rules that threatens to unravel the common asylum system.Tensions are running high after Italy’s prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, said he was not ready to discuss secondary movements “without having first tackled the emergency of ‘primary movements’ that Italy has ended up dealing with alone”.Italy’s far-right interior minister, Matteo Salvini, said: “If anyone in the EU thinks Italy should keep being a landing point and refugee camp, they have misunderstood.”The European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, reluctantly agreed to host the weekend summit to help Merkel, after her governing coalition came close to breaking point. Avramopoulos stressed that the summit would be about “consultations” to prepare the ground for decisions to be taken by all 28 EU leaders at a European council meeting next Thursday.Warning that the future of the EU’s border-free travel area was at stake, Avramopoulos said: “The European leadership of today will be held accountable in the eyes of future generations if we allow all these forces of populism to blow up what has been achieved”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fa28acf8af4efad3914e5e93ea78a883a9c37355/0_0_4800_2880/master/4800.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7173a7579f17dfa75dca125872275dc1","title":"hungarian nationalist rock opera to retell 1920s grievances","story":"Treaty that sliced up territory after first world war remains a source of anti-liberal sentimentThe signing of a 1920 peace treaty does not immediately sound like ideal subject matter for musical theatre. But on Friday and Saturday night, hundreds of singers, dancers, acrobats and horsemen will fill the vast concrete expanse of Budapest’s Heroes’ Square for performances of Trianon: the rock opera.The treaty of Trianon sliced up Hungary in the aftermath of the first world war and the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian empire. It still features heavily in Hungarians’ historical imagination 98 years later, and the so-called “Trianon trauma” is one of the building blocks for the nationalism of Viktor Orbán’s government.“Trianon – the word and the subject matter – has been stirring passions in our country for a hundred years,” Gábor Koltay, the rock opera’s director and a member of Orbán’s Fidesz party, said at a recent press conference. “We will show how the events of 1920 – the dismemberment of the country – impacted our lives.”Orbán, who recently won a third consecutive term as prime minister, has cannily taken advantage of the sense of historical victimhood and loss among many Hungarians. It has helped him deliver a hard-right agenda, which this week saw parliament pass the so-called Stop Soros law that criminalises any inidual or group that offers to help an illegal immigrant.At Trianon, Hungary was deprived of more than half of its pre-war territory and population. Many of these people were not ethnic Hungarians, but the treaty left more than 3 million Hungarians outside the borders of the new Hungary.“Around 2 million of these Hungarians were living right on the borders, in majority-Hungarian areas, so any fair treaty based on self-determination would have included them,” said András Mink, a historian.When Orbán’s government came to power in 2010, one of its first acts was to establish a “day of national unity” on 4 June, the anniversary of the signing of the Trianon treaty. Orbán quickly made ethnic Hungarians living in neighbouring states eligible for Hungarian citizenship. These new citizens – in Slovakia, Romania, Serbia and Ukraine – have voted overwhelmingly for Orbán’s Fidesz party, giving it an electoral boost.Orbán has painted himself as the man who has led Hungary on a path back to recovering from some of the mental and moral losses at Trianon, if not the territorial ones. “Since Trianon we have never been so close to bringing our nation back to self-confidence and vitality as we are now,” Orbán said in a speech last year. “And if Hungary has a government that will serve foreign, globalist interests then Hungarians will lose this historic opportunity, and not just for one electoral cycle but for decades to come.” Few Hungarians believe that a redrawing of borders to regain lost land is possible or even desirable, although the opinion is still occasionally aired in pro-government media. More often, government figures have called for “moral reparations” and used the painful memory of Trianon as a rallying call for modern-day nationalism, and even to back up Orbán’s virulent anti-migration philosophy.In a letter to locals asking them to vote against EU migration quotas in a 2016 referendum organised by Orbán’s government, István Vitányi, a Fidesz MP, wrote: “At Trianon we lost the majority of our country and we cannot lose the rest of it. So vote no!” Orbán’s critics say history teaching is one of many areas where the government is attempting to exercise increasing control. “There used to be a relatively free textbook market now there’s basically a monopoly,” said László Miklósi, chairman of Hungary’s Independent Association of History Teachers.He said textbooks now offered a simplistic take on the “Trianon dictate” and Hungary’s victimhood. “Nobody sensible can doubt that what happened to Hungary in 1920 was unfair however, it’s better if students can form their own opinions from looking at the sources.” The approach also stretched to more recent history, Miklósi said. Two years ago the association fought a court battle to have a government-funded history textbook withdrawn that painted Orbán as a national hero and asked students to write an essay in support of an anti-migration speech by the PM. The classroom is not the only place where the lessons of history appear tailored to an official narrative that portrays Hungary purely as a victim. A 2014 monument to the Nazi occupation in a central Budapest square has been criticised for whitewashing the role of Hungarians in the Holocaust. It depicts Hungary as the archangel Gabriel under attack from the German imperial eagle. Locals have created a rival, makeshift memorial on the pavement by the monument, dedicated to “historical truth”.Mária Schmidt, an Orbán loyalist, runs the Terror House, a central Budapest museum that chronicles the horrors wrought on Hungary by both the Nazis and the Soviets. Her latest book, heavily advertised inside the museum, is a collection of rants against the alleged Islamisation of Europe and “self-assured and arrogant” migrants who are enacting a long-held plan of eastern peoples to occupy Europe.A magazine controlled by Schmidt recently ran a list of 200 “mercenaries” supposedly paid by the Hungarian-American financier George Soros to destroy Hungary – an eyebrow-raising gambit from someone who runs a museum dedicated to the memory of victims of repressive regimes that drew up similar enemy lists.Orbán’s critics say the prime minister has exploited Hungary’s difficult history to push his nationalist messages, but they also acknowledge that the trials of the 20th century, and particularly the dismemberment at Trianon, provide fertile ground for doing so. “When you want to track down the roots of anti-western and anti-liberal sentiment in Hungary, you should go back to that moment in history, when for many the lesson was that the ideas of liberty and self-determination are valid only for the western powers,” said Mink."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cd4321a62700990f78fcc124a040402ff8fcc515/239_419_4049_2429/master/4049.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c81be4fd402ae4a5390f1e1c9383cc0e","title":"libya turmoil a hurdle for eus north africa migration centre plan","story":"Fighting for Libyan oil terminals highlights obstacles, ahead of emergency EU meeting on migration crisisSenior European diplomats have privately admitted that plans to stabilise Libya, on which the long-term hopes rest of an end Europe’s migration crisis, are badly off track.European leaders will meet on Sunday in a hastily arranged emergency meeting as the German coalition threatens to collapse over an asylum row and Italy’s far-right interior minister, Matteo Salvini, has refused to allow NGO rescue boats to land in the country.Muammar Gaddafi was ousted as president in 2011 after more than 40 years in power. But deep ision between his supporters and adversaries persisted. An internationally recognised National Transitional Council took over, but quickly succumbed to schism, particularly between east and west.The transitional authorities found it impossible to extend their writ across the whole country, which was splintering into myriad factions: former regime loyalists, revolutionary brigades, local militia, Islamists, old army units, tribes, people trafficking gangs.A General National Congress was elected in 2012 and established itself in Tripoli. But when a national parliament was elected in 2014, the GNC refused to accept the result the new body had to install itself in the eastern city of Tobruk. Libya now effectively had two governments - the former buttressed by Islamist militias in its Tripoli stronghold, the latter supported by Khalifa Haftar, a renegade army colonel now head of the armed forces.Libya has become too unsafe for diplomats and most aid workers. The UN pulled its staff out in 2014 and foreign embassies followed suit. Tripoli international airport is largely destroyed by fighting.The conflict has killed 5,000, ruined the economy, driven half a million from their homes and trapped hundreds of thousands of migrants seeking to get north to Europe in a nightmarish network of brutal camps. Diplomatic attempts at reconciliation have proven fruitless thus far.The EU hopes to set up regional disembarkation centres in north Africa so that not all asylum claimants picked up by search and rescue missions heading to Europe are transferred to Italy, but the proposals also rest to a degree on political reconciliation in Libya leading to greater security and a less benign climate for people traffickers. But diplomats say plans to stage presidential elections in Libya this year look increasingly unlikely after a weeklong battle for the control of the country’s oil terminals ended with severe damage to the country’s critical oil infrastructure.Forces loyal to Khalifa Haftar, the Libyan strongman in the east of the country, claimed to have recaptured the terminals on the so-called oil crescent on Thursday, but the damage was described by the Libyan National Oil Corporation as catastrophic and hugely expensive.It said two storage tanks at the Ras Lanuf port terminal had been destroyed following their weeklong seizure by militia led by the former Petroleum Facilities Guard (PFG) local commander Ibrahim Jadhran, with the spread of fire threatening other tanks. Prior to the fighting, Ras Lanuf operated five crude oil storage tanks. Its crude oil storage capacity has dropped from 950,000 barrels to 550,000.The British ambassador to Libya, Frank Baker, described the attack as a tragedy for the Libyan people.Libya has two rival governments – one in the east controlled by Haftar and another in the west backed by the UN – while effective power in much of the country remains in the hands of local militias.Haftar’s Libyan National Army claimed the attack had been supported by the UN-backed government in Tripoli, and was designed to distract it from its long-term assault on Derna, the last coastal city in the east to elude Haftar’s control. European diplomats said the fighting showed how far Libya remains from a political settlement, and underlined there was no point holding presidential elections if they were marred by violence and the result not respected by all sides. The need to achieve reconciliation among the 6.4 million Libyans is becoming ever more urgent for European politicians as populist and far-right movements gather strength by highlighting unease about migration.But the idea of processing centres is greeted with suspicion by many European politicians due to the degrading conditions in existing Libyan detention centres. Antonio Panzeri, the chair of the European parliament’s human rights committee, said any future cooperation must be conditional on the closure of existing detention centres.Judith Sutherland, associate director at Human Rights Watch Europe said a host of questions arose from the plan: “Who will do the processing, what safeguards are in place, will NGOs and lawyers have access, what are reception conditions, how are vulnerable groups protected, will people have genuine prospect of resettlement to EU?”One difficulty is that relatively few asylum claims in any African processing centre will be granted. The vast majority of asylum claims in Italy, once assessed, are rejected on the grounds that the claimant is an economic migrant, and the same is likely to happen in countries such as Niger.That leaves unanswered whether a rejected claimant would voluntarily return to their native country or instead seek to reach Europe by other means.The greater immediate difficulty in Italy is the speed with which claims of African migrants are being processed, and deported, not the number of new arrivals, which is slowing substantially.

File photograph: PAThe State Examinations Commission is hiring iniduals without any teaching qualifications to correct students’ Junior and Leaving Cert papers due to a shortage of qualified staff.The development has sparked concerns over the standard of correcting and accusations that the integrity of the State exams is at risk.The commission has insisted, however, that any non-teachers who have been hired have third-level qualifications in the subject area they are marking.Teachers say the rate of pay for correcting exam papers – which ranges between €5 and €32 per exam – is the main reason why there are difficulties sourcing qualified staff. A recent teachers’ union conference heard the pay rates described as “blood money” given the hefty tax rates teachers face outside their core pay. The commission’s website states that “all suitably qualified teachers are welcome to apply for these positions” and that applicants must have “recent teaching experience in the relevant subject area or related subject”.However, it has confirmed to The  that while examiners are primarily recruited from a pool of experienced teachers, there are instances where non-teachers may be recruited as long as they have a third-level qualification in the relevant subject.It said this takes place only if vacancies remained after “all suitable and fully qualified applicants have been offered appointment”.A spokesman said it was not easy to identify how many non-teachers were due to be hired this year until the recruitment process was fully concluded.“We are satisfied that all examiners are appropriately qualified in the relevant subject area and that priority is given to teaching experience in making decisions on appointment,” he said.Fianna Fáil’s education spokesman, Thomas Byrne, said the shortage of teachers was putting correcting standards for exams at risk.“Last-minute cramming might be expected of some students, but last-minute recruitment of correctors with no teaching qualification is not acceptable. “We need to know in what subjects this is happening and to what extent. Students have a right to ensure their scripts are marked to the highest possible standard.”The commission has struggled to fill examiner positions for a range of subjects until recent days.It is still seeking examiners to mark Junior Cert religious education exams, and is filling vacancies “as they arise” in Junior Cert geography and French.In using non-teachers, the commission said all examiners received detailed training and instruction in order to fulfil their role. The commission said it had an absolute responsibility to exam candidates to ensure their work was marked to the highest standards of quality and integrity and had a range of measures in place to assure quality in the examinations which included measures to identify poor practice."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"After move to new post civil servant\u0026rsquos official title will be director general of Global IrelandPractice of CervicalCheck sending smear tests abroad has been criticisedJean-Claude Juncker assures Varadkar State is priority in Brexit talksRate of pay for correcting exam papers cited as main reason for rolling staff shortagesQuestions will relate to experiences of inappropriate behaviour and bullyingChristopher Kerr (32) is serving life for the murder of schoolboy Michael McIlveen (15)\u0026lsquoAfter many years, I felt my hand, as if a hollow shell got filled with life again\u0026rsquoSandra Higgins (37) from Cavan is accused of causing serious harm to a babyT\u0026aacutenaiste stresses white-collar crime must be dealt with robustlyCommunity group says it is disappointed hospice not seeking alternative locationFile of 800-pages on \u0026euro1.6bn disposal of NI loans understood to have come from developerReporters win awards for court reporting and coverage of legal issuesDr Amal Al Qubaisi \u0026lsquoa figure of great historical significance\u0026rsquo, Dr Martin McAleese saysFindings likely to lead to changes in the way such conditions are treatedEuropean Commission president tells Oireachtas Ireland comes first in talks\u0026lsquoCaranua failed.

Mr Varadkar was told by Mr Juncker during a meeting in Dublin on Thursday that matters relating to Ireland, such as the future of the Border, would not be left until last-minute talks on Brexit are held in October.He told the Taoiseach privately that Ireland would not be left isolated – a point he later reinforced publicly. The meeting came as the timetable for dealing with issues such as the Border “backstop” – which prevents a hard Border even if Britain and the EU fail to reach a deal – has slipped in recent weeks. The Government had initially insisted that sufficient progress needed to be made on the issue before next week’s European Council summit, but now accepts that an agreement will not be reached until October. Mr Varadkar said it was “abundantly clear” the backstop must be in place for there to be a withdrawal agreement between the EU and Britain and a transition period from when Britain leaves the bloc in March.“The withdrawal agreement must include a legally binding backstop so that there cannot be a hard border on the island of Ireland in the future, whatever circumstances may prevail,” he said. Reflecting his assurances to Mr Varadkar, Mr Juncker told a press conference that Brexit issues affecting Ireland were not “a bilateral question between Ireland and the United Kingdom” but rather “an issue between the UK and the European Union”.“We want to make it clear again and again that Ireland is not alone. We have Ireland backed by 26 member states and the commission – this will not change,” he said. “I am strongly against any temptation to isolate Ireland and not to conclude the deal on Ireland. Ireland has to be part of the deal.”The potential for Ireland to be left exposed as an outstanding issue at the end of negotiations on Britain’s withdrawal from the EU was discussed in a number of internal meetings among senior Government figures in recent days.Mr Varadkar told a meeting of the Cabinet subcommittee on the EU, which deals with Brexit issues, that the Government was not planning for a hard border.The Government is insisting it will still not make any preparations for a hard border, even as Mr Juncker warned the Dáil that provision must be made for a “no deal” Brexit.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

He said the Government was “deeply grateful for the remarkable solidarity and support we have received from the EU institutions and fellow member states, none more so than from president Juncker”.Mr Varadkar also paid tribute to the “diligence and understanding shown by the commission’s lead negotiator, Michel Barnier”, who travelled to Dublin with Mr Juncker.The Taoiseach, referring to the particular challenges faced by Ireland with Brexit, said “the backstop for the Irish Border, agreed in December, must be legally operative in the withdrawal agreement to apply ‘unless and until’ an alternative solution is agreed”.Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin said “there is a considerable and growing unease about the failure to move from generalities to concrete and final agreements in the negotiations”. “The simple fact today is that London may actually never come up with a credible proposal,” he warned. “We are extremely concerned with how negotiations on the Irish text have now been linked with the overall withdrawal treaty text and its provisions for final status negotiations.”Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald said British prime minister Theresa May had “set out a policy of Ireland last, if at all”.She said, “We are most disappointed that, despite an assurance that the Irish question would be answered in advance of setting out the details of the new relationship that Britain wishes to foster with the EU, this has not happened.”Ms McDonald said “in the absence of the British demonstrating how they would avoid a hard border, uphold the Good Friday Agreement and protect citizens’ rights, it is reckless to allow talks to progress to the next phase”.She appealed to Mr Juncker and Mr Barnier “not to make this mistake”.Ms McDonald said :“I hope the EU does not blink and fulfils this mission” of “Ireland first and Ireland now”.Mr Juncker intervened in response to People Before Profit TD Richard Boyd Barrett, who asked if Ireland could trust him “with our Border or the interests of the people in this country”.Mr Boyd Barrett said “We do not trust the Tories. Can we trust you?”.The commission president replied “Yes.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Rentokil warned that 55C was the temperature required to kill moth larvae.David Cross, from Rentokil, said: Washing clothes at high temperatures or having them dry cleaned are practical methods to help remove moth larvae from clothing.The survey also found that 52 per cent of people said they now buy fewer items of clothing than they did give years ago, and instead choose good-quality clothes which will last longer, which could be exacerbating the problem.Pest firms say washing clothes at higher temperatures helps kill off larvaeRentokil said higher-quality clothes were often made with natural materials such as wool and silk which contain a protein called keratin, the preferred food for moth larvae.The survey found 13 per cent of respondents have had a moth problem, suggesting that more than 6.8 million Britons have experienced damage due to larvae feeding on their clothes.Mr Cross, added: “May\u0027s unseasonably warm temperatures and the early start to summer has helped to create the perfect conditions for moths to breed and potentially thrive in British households.“With a prolonged breeding season, clothes and soft furnishings in British homes could be at increased risk to damage caused by moth larvae feeding on the natural fibres they contain.”Earlier this year English Heritage released the results of a survey launched after experts saw the numbers of common or webbing clothes moths double, and observed the appearance of the pale-backed clothes moth.The survey, which saw thousands of traps handed out at English Heritage sites and received data from 42 counties, discovered an alarmingly high number of the new species, the pale-backed clothes moth.It also revealed that the reported catch of the common clothes moth was significantly higher in London and the South East, where an average 23 moths were found per trap, than anywhere else in England.The top tips for preventing clothes moth infestations include checking for moths in the creases, folds and behind labels of clothing, keeping items in vacuum bags, and taking out clothes from the wardrobe and giving them a good shake at least once a month to disturb the moths.Please review our commenting policyComment: How I learned to love New York\u0026#39s tipping culture ‘You can’t say Shakespeare has nothing to offer because he’s a white man’: Sheila Atim on why classic literature should stay on the curriculumQuarter of Japanese workers confess they want to kill their bossGreece crisis declared \u0026#39over\u0026#39 after eight years as eurozone agrees debt reliefEU slaps retaliatory tariffs on US as trade war rattles marketsSophie Gradon dies at 32: Love Island pays tribute to former contestantFour million EU nationals will get right to stay in the UK after Brexit - and violent criminals could be among themRoseanne spinoff set for autumn after Barr agrees to walk away from showComment: Of course she cares.

Therefore, immediate mitigation measures would need to be accelerated.“While\u0026nbspAirbus\u0026nbspunderstands that the political process must go on, as a responsible business we require immediate details on the pragmatic steps that should be taken to operate competitively.“Without these,\u0026nbspAirbus\u0026nbspbelieves that the impacts on our UK operations could be significant. We have sought to highlight our concerns over the past 12 months, without success.“Far from Project Fear, this is a dawning reality for\u0026nbspAirbus. Put simply, a no-deal scenario directly threatens\u0026nbspAirbus’\u0026nbspfuture in the UK.”In its risk assessment,\u0026nbspAirbus\u0026nbspsays it is “getting increasingly concerned by the lack of progress on the Brexit process”.It says it supports more than 110,000 jobs among 4,000 suppliers in the UK, with parts crossing the Channel “multiple times”.This business relies on “frictionless trade” under customs union and single market rules, it added, saying “any change in customs procedures, logistics and environmental standards would have major industrial and cost impact”.It went on: “A no-deal Brexit must be avoided, as it would force\u0026nbspAirbus\u0026nbspto reconsider its footprint in the country, its investments in the UK and at large its dependency on the UK.“Given the ‘No-dealhard Brexit’ uncertainties, the company’s dependence on and investment in the flagship Wing Of Tomorrow programme would also have to be revisited, and corresponding key competencies grown outside the UK.“This extremely negative outcome for\u0026nbspAirbus\u0026nbspwould be catastrophic.“It would impair our ability to benefit from highly qualified British resources, it would also severely undermine UK efforts to keep a competitive and innovative aerospace industry, while developing high value jobs and competencies.”UK news in picturesRevellers watch the sunrise as they celebrate the pagan festival of Summer Solstice at Stonehenge in Wiltshire.

This is a wake-up call.

Therefore, immediate mitigation measures would need to be accelerated.“While\u0026nbspAirbus\u0026nbspunderstands that the political process must go on, as a responsible business we require immediate details on the pragmatic steps that should be taken to operate competitively.“Without these,\u0026nbspAirbus\u0026nbspbelieves that the impacts on our UK operations could be significant. We have sought to highlight our concerns over the past 12 months, without success.“Far from Project Fear, this is a dawning reality for\u0026nbspAirbus. Put simply, a no-deal scenario directly threatens\u0026nbspAirbus’\u0026nbspfuture in the UK.”In its risk assessment,\u0026nbspAirbus\u0026nbspsays it is “getting increasingly concerned by the lack of progress on the Brexit process”.It says it supports more than 110,000 jobs among 4,000 suppliers in the UK, with parts crossing the Channel “multiple times”.This business relies on “frictionless trade” under customs union and single market rules, it added, saying “any change in customs procedures, logistics and environmental standards would have major industrial and cost impact”.It went on: “A no-deal Brexit must be avoided, as it would force\u0026nbspAirbus\u0026nbspto reconsider its footprint in the country, its investments in the UK and at large its dependency on the UK.“Given the ‘No-dealhard Brexit’ uncertainties, the company’s dependence on and investment in the flagship Wing Of Tomorrow programme would also have to be revisited, and corresponding key competencies grown outside the UK.“This extremely negative outcome for\u0026nbspAirbus\u0026nbspwould be catastrophic.“It would impair our ability to benefit from highly qualified British resources, it would also severely undermine UK efforts to keep a competitive and innovative aerospace industry, while developing high value jobs and competencies.”UK news in picturesRevellers watch the sunrise as they celebrate the pagan festival of Summer Solstice at Stonehenge in Wiltshire.

When I did, one asked:\u0026nbsp“Can we pray for you?”I asked why they wanted to pray for me, and the same person answered that they felt called by God to walk the streets of DC\u0026nbspand let God’s voice tell them who might be “broken” or otherwise need prayer.As a Christian, I’m opposed to neither prayer nor people praying specifically for me, at least not when it’s done in good faith.But I’m also a transgender woman, and I was dressed in gorgeous makeup and clothing and earrings. I sure caught the gist of why these folks happened upon me to offer prayer.My introduction to Christianity was in evangelical churches. For years, I navigated conservative religious spaces, where I encountered bigotry and attempts to shame LGBT+\u0026nbsppeople and women as often as I found warmhearted people eager to serve others.There was more than a little racism, too. I’ve heard the statement “I’ll pray for you” said with love, and with judgment and scorn. I know the difference, and the folks who confronted me outside the cafe were making their judgement clear.Instead of a theological debate that usually goes nowhere for lack of good faith in discussion, I wanted them to feel what it’s like to have someone supposedly approach in love but inflict pain and discomfort. Perhaps that’s what it takes. A forced perspective in empathy. Why not try that approach?I could have ignored them but I’ve had it with some evangelicals giving a bad name to their community by insisting on defining people’s humanity for them. These three assumed I was broken because of my gender identity. They saw the constellation of my personhood through a backward telescope.It angered me that the whole of my being could be reduced to their flawed understanding of LGBT+\u0026nbsppeople, a view that could easily be revised if only they would take the time to get to know me instead of assuming they already did.So I would be damned if I would let them interrupt my Sunday afternoon coffee when I certainly wasn’t bothering them.I asked their spokeswoman if she understood how it might look to be searching for “broken” people to pray for, and specifically pick out a random transgender person. And they looked more than taken aback.I stood up, smiling but internally annoyed, and asked them what the Book of Matthew says about prayer. Their eyes went wide. One guy stammered nervously, clearly having trouble answering the question.The other two were just as flummoxed, ambushed by the idea that the “broken” transgender person was asking a simple question about a common verse on prayer in Matthew.For those who don’t know, Matthew is the first book in the New Testament and one of the three Synoptic Gospels, each of which are narratives of the life of Christ, frequently using the same stories, often with identical wording.While all three contain instruction on prayer, I reached for Matthew 18:20 because of its strong presence in the evangelical community and its common misapplication by members. In short, it reads: “For where two or three are gathered in my name, there am I with them.”Those up on their biblical knowledge might wonder why I didn’t turn to Matthew 6:5-7, scathing verses that call out hypocrites who are performative in their Christianity, telling them to pray in private rather than out on the streets so that they might be seen by others.It’s a good one that, unsurprisingly, is ignored in evangelical circles. They know it’s there, but it’s inconvenient.The verse I selected hits hard instead because it’s so commonly heard before a group prayer in evangelical churches. There, it tends to be inaccurately interpreted as a numbers game, one that’s about bringing to fruition what is requested of God in prayer.Evangelicals think of it as a call to bring more people into the church or, more cynically, personal prosperity through the Gospel.In reality, it’s a verse on accountability before God and about how God may work that accountability through humans. As Leisa Baysinger notes on the blog Our Ancient Paths, it references earlier Jewish tradition that at least three witnesses must agree to bring judgement on someone.In the moment I was unaware of its exact roots, which were surprisingly apt given the attempt of this small band to sit in judgement of me, but I still understood what was at stake in the line, and I loved the idea of using a verse on accountability that they had probably misunderstood numerous times.I was the judged who understands the law better than those attempting to judge, and on that day I sought to bring accountability.These aren’t issues I take lightly, and the passive-aggressive condescension of these three was anything but harmless. This wasn’t the time to be polite.Not when the Trump-Pence White House is trying to ban transgender people from the military. Not when transgender students with stories of discrimination are turned away by the US\u0026nbspDepartment of Education.Not when President Donald Trump and vice president\u0026nbspMike Pence\u0026nbspare seeking to implement a Health and Human Services Department regulation allowing healthcare workers to deny potentially lifesaving treatment to LGBT+\u0026nbsppeople.Not when the Human Rights Campaign reports that in the US, eight transgender people have been killed in 2018 and 28 in 2017 –\u0026nbspthe most ever annually. I wasn’t going to be silent.Instead, I spoke.“You know how Matthew says that where two or three are gathered in Jesus’ name, there he is with us?”They stared at me blankly. I had no intention of going easy on them.“That is what Matthew says, is it not?”At last, one spoke up: “Yes, that’s right.”And they nervously stepped forward into a circle.I said to one:\u0026nbsp“You start us off.” And she did, going through the motions quickly and antiseptically because they clearly wanted to get as far as they could from this awkward situation. And then I picked it up when it was clear she was done.“Lord Jesus, thank you for the benefit of these friends,” I began, wholly honest with God about how I hoped she would bless my new friends, encouraging them to affirm and be inclusive of others. I was hopeful that their community would honour all as God made them and value the strength of ersity.I mentioned the natural beauty of the LGBT+\u0026nbspcommunity and thanked God again for making us as we are, throwing in a genuine wish that their trip back home would be a safe one.Then, knowing my audience, I wrapped up with the usual evangelical banal phraseology –\u0026nbsp“no weapons shall be formed against them”,\u0026nbsp“put God on their hearts” –\u0026nbspto let them know I was just as familiar with their community’s vernacular as they were, maybe more so.As I finished, having returned their “let us pray for you” to them tenfold, they murmured their thank you’s and scuttled away.I don’t know whether my words made it through, but I hope they have a sense of what it feels like to have a stranger impose self-righteous venom on them. I also hope that they’ll realise how much actions such as these diminish the power of prayer and enable so much harm to LGBT+\u0026nbsppeople.A prayer that one might change their sexuality or gender identity is egregious encouragement to those who would seek to discriminate against LGBT+\u0026nbsppeople in our laws and to do violence against them in our communities. My own prayer’s acidity served to make them aware of their own by way of spiritual inoculation.The Genderquake debate did more harm than good for transgender peopleWhy has Caitlyn Jenner been chosen to speak about ‘ersity’?These people did not want to know more about me. They wanted to talk at me and pray at me. And I’m confident that’s not how Jesus would go about it.There are many in the evangelical community who love and affirm their LGBT+\u0026nbspfamily, friends and fellow human beings.It’s unfortunate, then, that others in the community still must be told a simple truth: They are not doing the Lord’s work by politicising prayer at the expense of others or by dumping their misplaced condescension on strangers they believe to be broken.Prayer should be a loving act, not a weapon of marginalisation.Clymer ia a transgender woman,\u0026nbspUS\u0026nbspArmy veteran and\u0026nbsppress secretary at the Human Rights Campaign\u0026nbspEnter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The result will be a tailor-made system based on the inidual.“This is a unique example of great British innovation and we are leading the world in developing this kind of person-centred system. Countries like New Zealand, Spain, France and Canada have met with us to see universal credit to watch and learn what is happening for the next generation of benefit system.”Referring to the NAO report, Ms McVey said it did not take into account the government’s recent changes to universal credit.“Our analysis shows that universal credit is working,” she said. “We already know it helps more people into work and stay in work than the legacy system.“Once fully rolled out it will be a single streamlined system, reducing administration costs and provide value for money for all our citizens.”But Margaret Greenwood, the shadow work and pensions secretary, said the NAO report into the government’s flagship welfare system was “damning” and described universal credit\u0026nbspas a “major failing of public policy”.\u0026nbspUK news in picturesRevellers watch the sunrise as they celebrate the pagan festival of Summer Solstice at Stonehenge in Wiltshire.

He urged Indians to be proud of their culture and history.“The gems of India’s unique heritage, such as yoga, will be respected by the world at large only when we ourselves respect our culture and traditions,” he said.Around the world, public yoga events were held in Afghanistan, Japan and Peru, while Australia and South Africa celebrated on Monday.“From Tokyo to Toronto, from Stockholm to Sao Paulo, yoga has become a positive influence in the lives of millions,” Mr Modi told participants on the lush green lawns.“In a world where non-communicable diseases, stress and lifestyle related ailments are rising, yoga can play a central role in mitigating these diseases to create a healthy mind and body.”In the buildup to Thursday’s event, Mr Modi took part in a social media campaign, begun by his BJP party ministers, to get people to share videos of their fitness workouts on Twitter.Celebrities\u0026nbspfrom Bollywood actors to sports superstars\u0026nbspgot involved, and Mr Modi’s own video showed him performing yoga on a boulder in his prime ministerial gardens.Social media was again awash with videos emulating Mr Modi’s on Thursday, including from staff at Delhi airport, pupils at thousands of schools and members of India’s armed forces.Amid questions over his appeal, PM Modi’s party sweeps to key victoryPlea to Indian PM in London for ‘tortured’ captive elephants Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi accused of spying on citizens India PM makes point of visiting Palestinians after meeting NetanyahuThe Indian navy released pictures of sailors doing yoga on board the world’s oldest aircraft carrier, the INS Viraat, decommissioned last year, and soldiers guarding the world’s highest battleground, the Siachen glacier in northern Jammu and Kashmir state, did yoga routines at an altitude of around 18,000 feet.The events clearly mustered a huge amount of public support. For some, however, there was a sinister edge to having public institutions take part in a scheme closely associated with the prime minister’s messaging. Even prisons were involved, with 15,000 inmates due to take part in yoga events on Thursday in the capital alone.Sagarika Ghose, a prominent journalist and political commentator, wrote on Twitter: “Believer in yoga, try every morning, immense benefits. But concerned: why does a GOVERNMENT need to promote yoga? Yoga’s an inidual choice, a personal option.”Mr Modi’s rule, she said, was “fast becoming an escapist Bollywood film where song and dance attempt to distract from hard realities”. One of the most liked responses to Ms Ghose’s tweet told her to “go to Pakistan” if she couldn’t show loyalty to India.For Ajay Mehra, a political scientist at Delhi University, the International Day of Yoga “has become an imposition”, forced on the people by government.“Something like yoga should not be part of a political project,” he told The Independent, adding that there were certain yogic practices – chanting mantras for instance – that could be offensive to some groups in a plural society, “Muslims in particular”.Mr Mehra noted that Jawaharlal Nehru, the first prime minister of India, stressed the importance of secular, pluralist leadership while also being a devoted practitioner of yoga – “but he didn’t publicise it”.International Day of YogaEnter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Still, the non-binding document has been criticised for its ambiguity and lack of commitments the North must adhere to in order to begin its denuclearisation process.Mr Trump has sought to defend the summit, claiming in a tweet on Monday that if his predecessor Barack Obama had made the initial steps towards a deal I have he would have been declared a national hero.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

When the downpour finally came, it was worse than anyone feared.In just four days, Cox’s Bazar received two-thirds of the average rainfall expected in the month of June. More than 100 landslides have been reported, several people have died and hundreds of families have been made homeless, forced to sleep in mosques or crowd into shelters with their relatives.Ahead of World Refugee Day\u0026nbspon Wednesday, the UN released a report showing that the number of displaced people in the world has risen to a new record high of 68.5 million, and highlighting the plight of the Rohingya fleeing persecution in Myanmar as one of the biggest drivers pushing up that number.But speaking from Cox’s Bazar in a break in the weather that has coincided with the end of the Ramadan fast, Caroline Gluck, a senior official with the UN’s refugee agency, said their message this year was to “celebrate” World Refugee Day as a tribute to those struggling through such hardship, and the charities fighting to help them.As is the case with the wider refugee crisis across the globe, the population of those displaced in Bangladesh is made up mostly of women and children. Aid workers have found that creating women-only centres for healthcare, counselling and childcare is having a dramatic impact on the Rohingya’s quality of life.Rohingya women and girls are taught sewing, play games, receive medical care and are offered counselling at women-only centres run by charities like IRC in Cox\u0027s Bazar (Jessica Wanless)“In any crisis, women and children are the most vulnerable,” Ms Gluck told The Independent - a problem only exacerbated as flooding and landslides cripple camp infrastructure. “Night-time can be a worrying time, particularly if you have to travel to use toilets. The camp is quite sprawled, and instead of living alongside people you know, you are living with strangers.”One of the charities providing women-only centres is the International Rescue Committee (IRC). Dalia Al-Awqati, IRC’s emergency director in Bangladesh, said up to 80 per cent of the refugees are women and children and in need of “specialised support”.“Many Rohingya women and girls have been raped, seen their husbands and children killed before their eyes and lots of them are facing raising their children alone,” she told The Independent. “They live in a situation that is exacerbated by the presence of stigma and discrimination.”IRC\u0027s women-only centres (Jessica Wanless)For 12-year-old Azara, the centre is an oasis of normalcy in a situation that is anything but, and a welcome break from the boredom that comes with living in a refugee camp.She said she came to the centre every day, finding a safe space where she can make friends, play games and engage in her favourite pastime - henna.“It feels like home,” she said. “We come straight after we have been to school. Every week there is at least one day for sewing. Every week we learn something new. We love to learn.”Ex-UN ambassador says \u0027destroying Rohingya exceeds costs\u0027 for MyanmarRohingya facing \u0027crisis on top of crisis\u0027 as world looks other wayRohingya say Myanmar singled out the educated in genocideArmed Rohingya group massacred Hindus in Myanmar, report alleges\u0027Bittersweet\u0027 Ramadan for Rohingya Muslims forced to flee their homesMs Gluck said centres like those run by the IRC were vital to encourage women “carrying the burden” of what happened to them in Myanmar to come forward and seek counselling and support, in what is traditionally a very culturally conservative society.Media reports have previously highlighted a spike in births nine months after the alleged brutal crackdown by Myanmar’s army in Rakhine state that forced the Rohingya to flee. The danger, Ms Gluck said, is that all pregnancies in the camp become stigmatised as potentially being the result of rape.And one of the biggest positives to come out of the creation of the centres has been the number of female volunteers working to foster new communities in their makeshift home.A lot of women are taking on jobs as safety volunteers or in counselling their fellow refugees directly, having received training from NGOs. “It has helped women to develop roles that they didn’t have back home,” Ms Gluck said.Senwara stands in the Kutupalong refugee camp in Cox\u0027s Bazar (Timothy NesmithIRC)Senwara, a 35-year-old mother of four, is a volunteer who helps spread word about the centre to other refugees. She became the only female “Majhi” or community leader in her area of the camp after helping distribute food aid, and sees promoting the centre as part of her responsibility.“Women come here to this centre because there are no men,” she said. “If there were men, families would not let teenagers or women giving birth come here because they would feel shy. They are serious about this matter.”Ms Gluck said the few days of good weather, plus celebrations around Eid, had brought “joy to many faces” in the camps. There is an upbeat mood also to coincide with World Refugee Day, with singing, volleyball and other competitions put on to showcase the best of life in the camps.Rohingya Crisis in Photos Rohingya

Rabbit pet advice: Is feeding them rabbit mix bad for them?

Israel, America, the Tories and Brexit the next.Corbyn’s off limits, obviously, as Frankie thinks he’s “a real person”, but there’s a regular cast of soft targets, including Donald Trump, Richard Branson (“a c***”), Boris, Michael Gove, Ruth Davidson (“a bastard”) and usually a joke about Prince Philip dying, which I think we can put down to the host’s very obvious and well-deserved self-loathing.Prince Philip, after all, was mentioned in dispatches fighting real Nazis in World War Two, instead of just ranting about them to a couple of hundred students at the Edinburgh Fringe.At the age of 97, The Duke is also still a thousand times more unpredictable, off-message, edgy and funny than any of the people on NWO and, unlike Frankie, who has 11 scriptwriters, also comes up with his own material.The hatred and abuse of Israel is slightly harder to explain, though. Frankie claims it’s because “They break international law”, but then so do a lot of countries, including Russia, which even shoots down passenger aircraft.A stroke of luck then, you might think, that the BBC’s just screened Frankie’s two-part, pre-World Cup travelogue, Frankie Goes To Russia, where, unfortunately, he didn’t have time to raise the issue of the aircraft, but he did go on Moscow radio to denounce the British Empire (topical or what!).If you were expecting anything else, of course, you give Frankie Boyle more credit than his apparent cowardice and hypocrisy deserves.If you were also expecting laughter, then I applaud your optimism, but you’ll no more get it on NWO than on Have I Got News For You, or The Mash Report, or any of those other shows that have decided the right-on part of the world is untouchable and their own left-wing agenda is far more important than being funny.The BBC’s continuing claims of impartiality, on the other hand? Well, forgive me if I let out the hollowest laugh of my life, but they are really, darkly funny.Ha . . .— GIVEN the BBC’s endless, self-serving and grovelling tributes to the NHS are still very much ongoing, I feel it would be wrong, at this point, if I didn’t join in the birthday celebrations.For though it has its faults and is often criticised, it’s been there for us, healing the lame, curing the sick, becoming the envy of the world, a shining beacon to the entire universe, which makes me fall to my knees and give thanks for seven decades’ service at the mere mention of its sacred initials.Happy 71st, Bupa.All those liars who say they want fat, unattractive people on Love Island. The disturbing Trouble With Women revelation that Anne Robinson keeps a scrapbook of her old newspaper columns, when so many hamsters still go without decent bedding every night.And The X Factor giving a job not just to Robbie Williams, who’s won 18 Brit awards and five Ivor Novello awards, but also his wife, Ayda Field, who handed Emmerdale the NTA’s 2017 Best Soap award. There on merit . . .IF you have ever wondered why some people are so dementedly pleased to see the World Cup arrive, try watching daytime TV just before the ball-kicking tournament starts.I did last Wednesday and quickly fell down a QVC rabbit hole, where I discovered Amanda Holden has a neat line in selling stuff nobody actually needs but everyone seems to want.Suitcases that aren’t really suitcases, string chairs designed to look like a cat’s sphincter, rugs that would make a Moroccan fez salesman blush, machine-woven toilet roll baskets, lamp-shades so taut and expressionless they could sit on the Britain’s Got Talent panel, if you just pre-programmed them with a dirty laugh.Amanda’s exclusive landfill range has the lot. Piece de resistance, though, has to be her “glass infinity spheres”, which defy any sort of purpose or description, but she had a crack anyway.“They’re, uhm, a bit like those things in the ’80s and ’90s you put fingers and hands on.”Lava lamps? Tamagotchis? Les Dennis? Sadly, we may never know.The afternoon’s real curve ball, though, was introduced by QVC’s endlessly enthusiastic host Pipa Gordon, vis-a-vis lightbulbs: “Amanda, bayonet or screw?”Get back to you, Pipa. I’m just emailing a format idea to ITVBe.Sophie and Sadie both switching their lights off the moment 5ive’s Ritchie Neville burst into song on a celebrity version of Take Me Out.The One Show’s Alex Jones telling David Walliams: “You’re handsome . . . in a different way.”And a dreadful opening to the World Cup being elevated by the brilliant Spain versus Ronaldo game, ITV’s superior selection of pundits and Wrighty, very solemnly assuring us: “I think Suarez has got a big one in him.”—TUESDAY, Good Morning Britain calls in the big diplomatic hitter to comment on the US/North Korea peace deal.Singer Michael Ball: “I would feel better if it wasn’t those two having the conversation.“But there is nothing better than people talking, ’cos . . . ”’Cos love, love changes everything. Hands and faces, earth and sky.AFTER a relatively slow start, Love Island is now in the groove and I am totally immersed. To such an extent that I developed a really strong loathing for a couple of the contestants last week.Namely, Eyal, who’s as ruthless and possessive as the next smirking little berk who claims he’s “spiritual”, and Hayley, a venomous little madam whose description of herself – “I’m cute, funny, feisty, dozy” – is a million miles away from anyone else’s, unless the Theatre Royal St Helens is seriously short of dwarves next Christmas.Fortunately, she’s gone now and there are quite a few of the Islanders that I do actually like.Stationery-obsessed Jack, who has Dancing On Ice 2019 written all over him, top secret Josh, who can’t say too much about his job (taps nose) and Laura, who, like every Scottish woman ever born, is incapable of disguising her feelings, good or bad, and has a biological clock that’s ticking like a Countdown Conundrum.It’s the production that still sets Love Island apart, though, and the fact it’s the only reality show which would drop Beethoven’s Pastoral Symphony into the mix or have the wit to pay off the Alex/Eyal showdown with this news: “Megan had to choose between a man who saves lives with his bare hands and a boy who can walk up and down in a straight line while pouting.“There was only ever going to be one winner.”Brilliant television.Steve Wilson: “Portugal’s big man in the sky is on the pitch.”Alex Scott: “Croatia looked lustlackre.”Glenn Hoddle: “The Ref saw it so he must have been watching.”THIS week’s winner is Gemma Collins and Tiffany from Bride Of Chucky.

Ex-Tory party chair and former boss of the BBC Chris Patten is the director of a City recruitment firm which has been hired by Russian energy giant En+, the Daily Mirror can reveal. The Foreign Affairs Select Committee has raised serious concerns about En+, which is “controlled by billionaire and Kremlin associate Oleg Deripaska”.  The revelation comes after we exposed links between two other senior Tories - ex-Tory Energy minister Lord Barker and ex-Tory leader Lord Hague - and En+.  Last month’s damning FASC report on Russian “dirty money” in the UK came just weeks after Donald Trump slapped sanctions on En+ and Mr Deripaska - a close ally of President Putin - in the wake of the Salisbury plot to kill Sergei and Yulia Skripal. The Mirror can reveal that in a bid to free itself of these US sanctions, En+ has hired City headhunting firm Russell Reynolds to search for new independent directors.  Lord Patten - a former chairman of the BBC - sits on the board of Russell Reynolds as a non-executive director. Our investigation into Russia and the Tories previously revealed another senior Tory - Greg Barker - had been appointed chairman of En+. We have unearthed how it was Lord Barker who appointed Russell Reynolds to help En+ in its hunt for new directors. Both Lord Barker and Lord Patten sit in the House of Lords. Lord Patten insists he had “no awareness of this project for En+”. The Mirror previously revealed that William Hague - also a Tory peer in the Lords - is raking in cash from a law firm linked to Vladimir Putin.  The millionaire ex-Tory leader is chairman of the International Advisory Group at legal giant Linklaters, which was criticised for refusing to answer questions from MPs over its involvement in last year’s London flotation of En+. There is no suggestion that any of the three Tory peers are in breach of the Lords’ Code of Conduct. Approached for comment, Lord Patten, 74, said: “I am indeed a member of the board of directors of Russell Reynolds’ parent company based in New York. “I have no involvement in the day to day operations of Russell Reynolds, and have no awareness of this project for En+, nor do I recall having ever met someone associated with En+.” However, Tom Brake MP, Lib Dem International Trade spokesman, said our findings raised “alarming” new questions about Russian influence in the UK.

The 37-year-old gave birth to her first child on Thursday - the second elected leader in history to give birth in office.  The new mum shared a sweet snap on her Instagram account as she spent another night in hospital. She wrote: One of the many special people we have been so grateful for over these past few months, our wonderful midwife Libby. Not only is she incredible at what she does, this morning she made me macaroni and cheese because she heard me mention a wee craving yesterday. Thank you so much for everything Libby!  Ardern became New Zealand\u0027s youngest prime minister when she took office through a coalition deal last year after an inconclusive election, and now becomes the first woman in the country\u0027s history to give birth while in office. Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters has stepped in as acting prime minister and will run the country for the next six weeks while Ardern takes maternity leave, according to an agreement they published earlier. Ardern gave birth in Auckland Hospital, the country\u0027s largest public hospital, with her partner, television presenter Clarke Gayford, at her side.  On Instagram Ardern wrote: Welcome to our village wee one. Feeling very lucky to have a healthy baby girl that arrived at 4.45pm weighing 3.31kg (7.3lb) Thank you so much for your best wishes and your kindness. We\u0027re all doing really well thanks to the wonderful team at Auckland City Hospital. Ardern is one of the few elected leaders to hold office while pregnant. Pakistan\u0027s Benazir Bhutto gave birth while she was prime minister in 1990. The public has generally been supportive of the popular prime minister.  New Zealand has long had a progressive reputation and was the first country to give women the right to vote in 1893 and Ardern is the country\u0027s third female prime minister.  Ardern found out she was pregnant on October 13, just six days before she was propelled into the job when Peters, the leader of the New Zealand First Party, announced he was siding with her Labour Party in post-election negotiations.  Peters is a colourful political veteran who first entered Parliament in 1978 and has held senior positions in both centre-left Labour and centre-right National governments. Ardern had played down the chances of any disruption arising from her absence, saying she and Peters would be in regular contact.  There actually hasn\u0027t really been a need to put down a plan... We already talk about significant issues, that will just continue, we\u0027ll just be in different roles, she said in a interview with Fairfax media just before going on maternity leave. Ardern has said she plans to return to work at the beginning of August. Then, Gayford will take care of the baby and will travel with Ardern between their Auckland home and the capital, Wellington, as well on international engagements.

Mr Johnson had described the Treasury as the heart of Remain and said dealing with the Chancellor’s department was part of an inner struggle. The Foreign Secretary also hit out at the folly of allowing rows over the Irish border to hold up the Brexit process. But tonight Mr Hammond took a swipe at Mr Johnson in his Mansion House speech to the City in London. He said: As we leave the EU we need to forge a new relationship with our European neighbours that protects those patterns of trade those business relationships that have been painstakingly built over decade, that maintains low friction borders and open markets. That does not make the Treasury, on my watch, \u0027the enemy of Brexit\u0027. Rather, it makes it the champion of prosperity for the British people outside the EU, but working and trading closely with it.  He also set out the Government\u0027s blueprint for maintaining London\u0027s position as a global capital of finance after Brexit through opening up access to markets beyond the EU. Mr Hammond spelled out how the Government will seek a series of new global financial partnerships to open up cross-border financial services. At the same time he reiterated his appeal to Brussels to come to the table to discuss a future relationship on financial services, something the EU side has so far refused. The Chancellor also emphasised that financial services will remain a foundation of the UK\u0027s economic success outside the EU, which will in turn require continued openness to the global economy. He said: Global Britain is not just a strategy for Britain\u0027s economic future, it\u0027s a statement about what kind of people we are and about the economy and the society we want to be. Connectivity was always at the heart of London\u0027s success. And to succeed in the future, we must remain connected to the world, including the important emerging markets. So while some question the benefits of openness, being open to the world, and being a global capital of finance, will continue to be the foundation of the UK\u0027s economic success.

Last Friday, it emerged the 1872 landmark had been sold to tycoon Sheikh Abid Gulzar for the knockdown fairground stall price of \u0026pound50,000. This is despite the fact that as recently as 2012, the pier was saved for the community by amazing local campaigners and a \u0026pound12million lottery grant. Another local group, Friends of Hastings Pier, had a new not-for-profit plan waiting in the wings, and were on the verge of reaching \u0026pound50,000 with a crowdfunder. But the administrators preferred Mr Gulzar – who has banned dog walkers, cyclists, fishing and picnics at nearby Eastbourne Pier, and threatened to introduce an entrance fee.  And the cash-strapped, austerity-hit council were powerless to help. This is heartbreaking for Hastings, but the pier is just one of an estimated 4,000 public spaces being sold off every year in every austerity-squeezed town in the country, according to a new report. The Great British Sell Off, produced by charity Locality – who dug out figures via FOI requests – says 20,651 public assets were sold off in the last five years alone. Locality chief Tony Armstrong points out that “4,000 buildings is more than four times the number of Starbucks in the UK”. Many are being lost to private developers for the highest price and will never be used by the community again. Some, like Hornsey Town Hall in London, are being made into flats while others, like the former Grade II listed Ealing Town Hall in West London and the landmark Liverpool Municipal Buildings, will become luxury hotels. In West Yorkshire, residents are trying to save the former Dewsbury Museum, closed by the council in 2016 after 120 years.  For the last 18 months, I’ve been retracing George Orwell’s Road to Wigan Pier through the industrial North and Midlands – and this great sell-off of our public spaces has been evident in every town in the country. Wigan Pier was basically a music hall joke about a coal jetty in landlocked Wigan, but across the country we’ve found evidence of the local authority fire sale. Privatised piers and boarded-up or flogged-off libraries, swimming pools, working men’s clubs, lidos, town halls, museums, youth centres have all been sold to the highest bidder. As councils have been squeezed by the Government and forced to choose between adult social care or keeping a museum open, they’ve felt forced to choose human care. But the result is all the places where we used to come together from our different walks of life have been shuttered up and closed off. The Government recently recognised we have a crisis of loneliness and yet what’s lonelier than having nowhere to go? We have a crisis of social cohesion, but nowhere we might bump into each other. Young people are being drawn into gangs by hanging out on street corners, but what about the places they used to go to? We have a crisis of working class people not going to into arts or sport, and yet the free places in which they used to access those things are derelict. Even estate pubs and local football clubs are being forced to close.

Distraught two-year-old Yanela was photographed sobbing at the feet of guards as they searched her mother Sandra Sanchez near the US-Mexico border.  The powerful original photograph, taken in Texas by Getty Images photographer John Moore, has become an iconic image in the media coverage about the separation of families by the Trump administration.   The crying tot appears on the front cover of TIME Magazine , which shows Donald Trump looking down at her dispassionately.   Yelena\u0027s image appeared on newspapers and magazines around the world, swelling the tide of outrage that shamed Trump into ending family separation on Wednesday. Now, a man claiming to be the child\u0027s father has spoken out, saying she was not separated from her mother at the border.  Denis Valera told Reuters: My daughter has become a symbol of the ... separation of children at the US border. She may have even touched President Trump\u0027s heart. Valera said the little girl and her mother have been detained together in the Texas border town of McAllen, where Sanchez has applied for asylum.  Honduran deputy foreign minister Nelly Jerez confirmed Valera\u0027s version of events. Varela said he was awestruck and pained when he first saw the photo of his crying daughter on TV. Seeing what was happening to her in that moment breaks anyone\u0027s heart, he said.  The photo was used on a Facebook fundraiser that drew more than $17million in donations from close to half a million people for the Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services (RAICES), a Texas-based nonprofit that provides legal defence services to immigrants and refugees.   The Trump administration\u0027s zero-tolerance immigration policy had led to the separation of 2,342 children from their parents at the US-Mexico border between May 5 and June 9. Video footage of separated children sitting in cages, an audiotape of wailing children and Moore\u0027s photo had sparked worldwide anger over Trump\u0027s immigration policies.

I have a favourite tree, it’s a Beech about 650 years old, it’s the best tree in the woods where I live. I go to it pretty much every day and I wander around it and think “wow”. It makes me feel humble because of how long it has lived and what it has seen. That tree will hopefully be here long after I’m dust. It is a remarkable thing, it’s lived through all of our recent history and hopefully it will live for many many years to come. But our trees are now critically under threat because thousands are needlessly being felled. Trees are essential organisms in our environment. They are important aesthetically in cities where they line the streets with green, making it a pleasant place to be. Crucially, this is important for our physical and mental health, too. Spending time walking through a green space is proven to be mentally beneficial walking through the woods with my dog Scratchy is my daily therapy. In Japan, they have a thing called Shinrin Yoku, which is forest therapy where you bathe in the woods, immersing yourself in that environment.  In Sheffield at the moment there is what I believe to be one of the most grotesque acts of natural vandalism taking place. The city has been endowed with a rich legacy of beautiful trees which form avenues, improve the physical and mental health of its citizens, and add to the wildlife value of that city. Now they are being needlessly felled. I’ve been there and I’ve seen it – there’s no ambiguity about it, it is totally unnecessary. Tree experts from all over the world were there with their heads in their hands, asking “What is going on here?” The council say it’s for maintenance of the highways and the pavements, they say the trees are damaging the built-in environment. But from what I’ve seen the damage is far more extensive as they rip out these glorious pillars of nature. And this is happening across a lot of cities in the UK. We have listed buildings, Georgian and Tudor, which are considered part of our national heritage, they’re national treasures. We invest money in their restoration and maintenance, I am not against that, but these trees that are being cut down are very often much older than these buildings and they’re completely irreplaceable. If these buildings were to burn down, it is justifiably tragic that we’ve lost a piece of architecture that is irreplaceable. But when a beautiful 600-year-old oak tree in the prime of its life and covered in wildlife, standing there like one of nature’s statues, is cut down, no one cares and no one is culpable. There are tree preservation orders, but they are often ignored and trees are cut down by developers anyway, especially if they will end up make making more money if they pay the fine and go ahead with their project.

Lucia Ghahramani has strenuously denied that her husband-to-be Jack Troutt, 23, cheated on her while he was on a lads\u0027 holiday to Ibiza. The 31-year-old bride-to-be branded the woman who made the allegation, Steph Kendall, an attention seeker and has confirmed that her wedding to Jack is still on. “I don’t believe the girl. I know Jack and this girl is just attention seeking, she told The Sun. “The wedding is absolutely still on. I was angry, but more at her. Steph says she overheard Troutt bragging to mates that he slept with a woman the previous night and wrote a Facebook post about the conversation.  The post read: If this is your boyfriend Jack staying at the Azuline Bergantin hotel Ibiza him and his friends have been proudly discussing that he cheated on you last night Hun. Troutt says she simply misheard a conversation between his pals about previous relationships while sat around the pool.   The post was taken down by Steph 24 hours after it was published but had already been widely-shared on social media, including by Love Island star Kady McDermott who tweeted it to her 357,000 followers.  Jack, from Essex, has said he now fears for the future of his relationship due to the unwanted attention caused by the post.  It\u0027s devastating because I haven\u0027t done anything wrong. I haven\u0027t had any sexual relations with a woman on this holiday. I haven\u0027t kissed another woman or even kissed another woman on the cheek on this holiday. It\u0027s literally bizarre.  When he confronted Steph in the hotel to explain she had misheard him, he claims she walked away from him - and the post remained being shared on Facebook .   I tried to confront her and at the same time she just kept walking away from me. I said listen, you\u0027ve got to get this post down, it\u0027s not true. She just walked away. I called her up through Facebook and she just said \u0027okay hun, bye\u0027. I\u0027ve got friends and family all contacting me asking me if I\u0027m alright because of the amount of abuse I\u0027m receiving from people all over the country. Jack is bravely speaking out and calling for tougher regulations on social media users accusing people of things that \u0027ruin their lives with no concrete evidence\u0027. I am sure I am not the first person this has happened to and I know I won\u0027t be the last. I think there should be some sort of law or regulation put in place to say how you can make an allegation like that without having anything set in stone. I just think something needs to be put in place where posts like that where you could ruin people\u0027s lives without having the concrete evidence. I\u0027ve reported this post to Facebook a thousand times but they\u0027re just not responding. They\u0027re just letting it keep getting shared and shared and shared.

CCTV images released today show Behailu Kebede, 45, fleeing the tower shortly before 1am on June 14 last year as the fire began to spread. Speaking today, Mr Kebede set out his desperation since losing everything on June 14 last year - compounded by a fear for his life - in a statement to the public inquiry. The Ethiopian-born Uber driver said media coverage painted a completely distorted picture that portrayed him like a criminal who was to blame for the fire. His upsetting written account ended: Sometimes I wish I had burned in the tower with the others. I have been burning inside ever since.  Mr Kebede was woken by the sound of his smoke alarm shortly before 1am on June 14, and found white smoke billowing from behind his fridge-freezer. He alerted his two female housemates, Elsa Afeworki and Almaz Kinfu, before knocking on every door of the neighbouring flats on the block\u0027s fourth floor and then rushing outside. Suggestions that he caused the fire by tampering with his fridge-freezer or that he had packed a bag before escaping led to safety concerns from the police. He said in a statement to the inquiry, published on Thursday: I met a number of officers there. They offered to take me to an unknown address outside London for my own protection. They wanted to put me into witness protection because they were concerned about reports in the press that showed me in a negative light, reports suggesting that I was to blame for the fire.  It was even suggested to me that I might need to change my name and not have any contact with my family. I told the police that I did not want to take part in any form of witness protection. Finally, they agreed to let me stay in a different part of London. As a result of the media intrusion, my partner and children were forced to move out of their home. The four of us have been living together in various hotels ever since. Security footage stills shown at the inquiry into the disaster on Thursday pictured Ms Afeworki walking down the stairs into the main lobby at approximately 12.56am, two minutes after the first 999 call. She is followed at around 12.58am by Mr Kebede, who is seen wearing just a T-shirt and a pair of trousers, but no shoes. Within two minutes, the first firefighter is seen entering the building. Mr Kebede had been saving to buy his fourth-floor flat in Grenfell Tower under Right to Buy and hoped to move his partner and two children in with him.  Instead, he left Flat 16 for the final time with only his phone, trousers and T-shirt - not even managing to put on a pair of shoes. His statement continued: Since the Grenfell Tower fire, my life has been a complete mess. For much of the time, I just wanted to be left alone. I had gone through a terrible ordeal that was affecting me mentally and physically. I wanted to meet the families of the bereaved but I did not have the courage to do so. I wanted to pay my respects to the deceased but felt unable to go out on my own. I believed that there were people out there who wanted to hurt my family and me. This was a very difficult time for me. I did not want to live under witness protection but I still took the threat posed to me seriously.  I genuinely feared for my life based on the information that the police gave me at that time. I knew so many of those who died in the fire at Grenfell Tower. I relive the horrific memories of that night all the time. I have not been able to sleep properly, thinking about those who died and seeing their faces when I close my eyes. Just talking about it is painful. I wish I could have banged on more doors and woken up more people. I am haunted by my failure to pick up my flat keys when I left and my inability as a result to get back into the building and warn more people. I feel broken inside. I am not the same man I used to be. I am still in fear, looking over my shoulder all the time. I do not feel comfortable in the presence of groups of four or more. I feel scared, as if I want to cry all the time. Sometimes I cannot even express myself and struggle to speak. Mr Kebede has not given evidence in person at the probe, saying through his lawyer that he was terrified.

An inquest today heard doctors could not rule out the possibility that Clare\u0027s seven-month-old died in bed after she rolled over onto her.  Evidence from a pathologist found the infant was placed in an unsafe sleeping situation with an intoxicated mother on the night she died. But revealing her devastation earlier this year, light sleeper Clare insisted she just wouldn\u0027t have rolled onto her daughter She said: I’m always going to be wondering if I didn’t have her in bed that night - I’ll wonder that for the rest of my life.”  She added: “In my heart of hearts I know I didn’t roll onto Charlotte. I just wouldn’t. I’m such a light sleeper and she was a very vocal baby.” The inquest into Charlotte\u0027s death heard how Clare had got into bed with the infant at midnight after drinking with her husband James. The couple had been drinking in their home, the hearing was told, with the mum saying she was in control of herself at all times. She awoke in bed with her baby at 4am on June 18 last year. Charlotte was rushed to Leeds General Infirmary, West Yorkshire, after she was found not breathing, but doctors were unable to save her. She was pronounced dead 45 minutes later. According to evidence from pathologist Michael Parsons read out to the court, there was no specific post-mortem finding confirming death as a result of overlaying. However, the doctor also stated in a report that death caused by overlaying remained a possibility that could not be excluded.  In written evidence read out by coroner Jonathan Leach to Wakefield Coroner\u0027s Court, Clare told how she described herself as merry on June 17, 2017. The evidence read On a scale of one-ten I would describe myself as a five. I am used to drinking alcohol and am used to drinking moderately - I was in control of myself at all times. Clare also wrote how she had been advised of the risk of co-sleeping, but she had never been told not to do it. And the digital marketing manager said she had never been told there could be a criminal offence with consuming alcohol. The court heard how she had slept with Charlotte in the bed with her back to the wall while arm-in-arm to prevent the baby being caught in pillows or falling out of bed. Detective Inspector Phil Jackson, of West Yorkshire Police, told the court how he had spoken at length with the infant\u0027s parents following her death. He said: It\u0027s obvious they were both caring and loving parents. As part of the process I went to the scene and reviewed what was there but there were no signs of neglect.

Just hours after they declared \u0027til death do us part on June 3, the groom posted on Facebook seeming to hit out at those questioning whether they had really be together forever. For all those doubters, get it up yi, he said, while describing his wife as the most unbelievable looking woman I have ever seen in my, she looked sensational. The gushing newlywed added: No words can describe how beautiful she was, a wedding only most can dream about and we made it reality.

Instead, the Department for Health has set up a helpline and is waiting for relatives to “come forward”. It means they may never learn the shocking truth of how their loved ones’ lives ended early “without medical justification”. Families of other victims said it was “outrageous” and called on the NHS to find as many relatives as possible. Out of 456 victims identified by the Gosport Independent Panel, just 163 families have been in touch with investigators.  It leaves 293 victims whose identities are known after the panel uncovered their medical records. Another 200 victims “probably” died in the same way but their medical notes cannot be found. Victims included Arthur Cunningham, 79, who died in 1998, five days after being admitted with bed sores and frail Elsie Devine, 88, who died after being pinned down by four nurses and injected with a large, inappropriate dose of opioids. Gillian Wilson, 73, whose husband Robert died at Gosport War Memorial, said: “It’s terrible so many people haven’t been spoken to and haven’t been involved in the inquiry. They should go through their records and find every person who died in suspicious circumstances.

Katie Smith, 18, from Oldham, Manchester, dropped to just 6st 7lbs after losing a shocking 4st 7lbs, and was so skinny that she wore children\u0027s size 10-11 clothes. Then aged 15, Katie restricted her food to just 100 calories a day, consumed 40 laxatives and jogged on the spot for hours. But, in November 2017, after being admitted for inpatient treatment, she recovered and now weighs 10st 2lbs and is a size 10.  Katie, a student at North Chadderton Sixth Form College, says: I realised that if I carried on, I would die. It really made me want to get better. Having an eating disorder was awful, I never thought I\u0027d make my 18th birthday. Growing up, Katie was a competitive swimmer and was always a healthy weight. I was never bigger than a size 10 but my frame was muscly and I weighed around 11st, she said. It was never anything that I worried about though.  But in February 2014, then aged 14, Katie developed bulimia. I would binge eat up to 5,000 calories before purging it up, she said. It became a cycle but, all the extra calories made me gain weight. In December 2015, Katie was trying on a size 12 bridesmaid\u0027s dress for the wedding of her sister, Joanne, 34, a teacher, when her eating patterns spiralled out of control. Katie said she felt horrendous.  The fabric clung to my figure and I hated how I looked, she said. After that, I developed anorexia. I exercised excessively every day, jogging on the spot for hours and performing 500 sit-ups. I only allowed myself to eat 100 calories of vegetables daily and I took 40 laxatives. Some days I\u0027d eat nothing and I weighed myself constantly. I was determined to fit into the dress and look skinny at the wedding. I wanted to look good for the pictures.  Unsurprisingly, Katie\u0027s weight plummeted and within six months, her 5ft 5in frame weighed just 6st 7lbs. She added: I could fit into size 10-11 children\u0027s clothes, but I purposefully wore baggy clothes to hide how bony my frame was. I even stopped swimming when I was 14 so mum would never realise how skinny I\u0027d gotten. My muscles ached constantly and I always felt cold. I had to wear multiple layers of clothes and my periods completely stopped. Handfuls of hair would fall out while I was in the shower and I\u0027d be left with clumps of hair on my pillow. It was terrifying. In February 2016, Katie attended her sister\u0027s wedding in Ireland and by this point she\u0027d already lost 2st 7lbs leaving her a size 6 and 8st 7lbs.  I was really looking forward to the wedding but on the day, I felt awful, she said. I didn\u0027t manage any of the wedding food. I felt huge even though now I realise I wasn\u0027t. My dress was a size 8 and hung off me. I pretended to family members that I\u0027d eaten and played with the food on my plate. In March 2016 Katie was diagnosed with anorexia by her psychiatrist and she was admitted as an inpatient at the Hope Unit, Bury, Greater Manchester, where she underwent therapy for three months. A month later, she reached her lowest weight of 6st 7lbs. In June 2016, she was discharged as an outpatient but she relapsed over the summer.  Katie said: I felt self-conscious about my weight and how I looked, especially when my friends were wearing bikinis. I started restricting food again. It got completely out of control. For the next 17 months until November 2017, Katie was in and out of hospital battling her eating disorder. It was tough I missed a year of college to concentrate on getting better, she said. Then one day, I realised that I didn\u0027t want to die I knew that if I carried on, I wouldn\u0027t make it. I upped my calorie intake and stopped exercising. I realised my health was more important.

Maisie Buchanan, two, was diagnosed with infant psoriasis as a baby and spent weeks in hospital . The rare condition causes her skin to flare-up and turn bright red and scaly. But her disgusted parents Lesley Buchanan, 35, and Alistair Buchanan, 36, have become fed-up at cruel strangers shunning her in the street and even accusing them of scalding their child.  Lesley said: People assume the worst and that she\u0027s been scalded. Others have asked if I left her out in the sun too long or forgot to put her sun hat on. They will ask me \u0027what\u0027s wrong with her?\u0027 like I\u0027m a neglectful parent. I always respond \u0027there\u0027s nothing wrong with her, she\u0027s a happy sweet little girl with a skin condition.\u0027 Maisie\u0027s skin is very flushed, it can go lobster red, and if she\u0027s flaking she looks different. People pick up on that and it\u0027s very hurtful. It really hurts that people think like that, it\u0027s like a knife to the heart.  Lesley and Alistair, from Falkirk, Scotland, have to slather their daughter in skin cream four times a day to help treat psoriasis, which has eased since her diagnosis in early 2017. The tot also has to have weekly injections of medicine. She wears special mittens to stop her clawing at her skin during the night. But Lesley continued: My husband was with her in a supermarket when her face was very inflamed and a woman in her sixties said to him \u0027look at the state of your child\u0027. She implied that he couldn\u0027t look after his child if her face looks like that.  I just want to get a megaphone and shout \u0027it\u0027s infant psoriasis and she\u0027s not contagious\u0027. I feel like saying \u0027she\u0027s not going to lick you and you\u0027re not going to catch something\u0027. It\u0027s when adults say something that it\u0027s upsetting.

With adults common sense seems to go out the window. I\u0027ve had people look at her and ask if she\u0027s contagious and move their children away with a look of passive disgust on her face.

And that means there are more daylight hours to have some fun with your family! So why not make the most of the extra daylight by getting out and about for some fun activities? Although the time of sunset varies between the south of the UK and the north, you should expect between 16.5 and 17.5 hours of daylight. So why not plan a late picnic or watch the sun set over the coast? The longest longest day  Want to maximise the amount of daylight you get? Head north. The further you go, the more daylight hours you’ll have. At the North Pole, summer months are constantly lit by a never setting sun. But going to the North Pole is tricky enough at the best of times, let alone on a Thursday afternoon when you have work the next day.  But there are less extreme trips you can make. For example, even the northern tip of Scotland sees days that are longer than those in at the tip of Cornwall. Indeed, on the summer solstice it\u0027s common for a kind of all-night twilight that means it never really feels like night. If you want to experience the longest day in the UK then you should jump on a plane to Orkney. The island of Unst has the most northerly campsite in the UK called Saxa Vord Resort. It\u0027s here that you can experience a day that lasts 19 hours and 10 minutes, with a sunset at 10:40pm. That\u0027s great for a late picnic or barbecue - but less than ideal if you\u0027re trying to get some sleep! If you\u0027re going to make this journey, don\u0027t forget to get the Garmin Drive Sat Nav , above, for the bit you\u0027re doing in a car. With lifetime map updates you\u0027re never going to find yourself driving down a newly-closed street or down a disused road. The shortest longest day   For those who want to shorten the longest day so they can get an earlier night, head to the Isles of Scilly. Scilly isn\u0027t the most accessible place in the UK and you\u0027ll need to catch a propeller-powered plane to the island from Cornwall and from there a boat to St Agnes. The island of St Agnes has a campsite called Troytown, which will see only 16 hours, 21 minutes and 24 seconds of daylight. Sunset is still at 9:37 though, which is pretty late if you\u0027ve got very little ones. The views from the campsite are spectacular though, with views out over the sea and lush green grass all around.  The Halfords 6 Person Tent is now just \u0026pound90 (save \u0026pound110), and is absolutely perfect for a summer solstice adventure. It\u0027s full walk-in height throughout, with a large living area big enough for a table and chairs. You\u0027re also guaranteed a good night\u0027s sleep, thanks to the double skin design with additional side and roof ventilation.  The Troytown campsite also allows barbeques, so take along the Halfords Briefcase BBQ which is now less than half price at just \u0026pound5 (was \u0026pound15, save \u0026pound10). The family-sized grill folds into a briefcase shape for portability, so it\u0027s a must-have for campers.  Alternatively, if you really want to cook up a treat you could take along the portable Halfords Double Stove With Grill which is now just \u0026pound25 (half price, was \u0026pound50). It features two upwards burners to use with pans and a downward burner which is great for using with the included toast rack.  Don\u0027t go anywhere, the football is on!   If you\u0027re a football fanatic then perhaps you\u0027ll want to stay home to catch some of the action. If that\u0027s the case then you can still make the most of the day. Set up a home picnic in the garden so everyone can enjoy either food, the football or both. You\u0027ll still get the benefit of a long day to spend with your family. Shelter from the rays under the Halfords 300 Fully Waterproof Gazebo , \u0026pound69 (was \u0026pound90, save \u0026pound21). This rather brilliant shelter offers 50+ UV protection, so it\u0027s perfect for sunny days - plus, it will keep you dry if there\u0027s a sudden shower! If you\u0027re looking to make an evening of it, why not set up a tent and let the kids stay in it overnight. They\u0027ll have an exciting time enjoying the light fade late and it will make a great story for school the next day.  To get everything ready for this sporting and eating extravaganza you\u0027ll want to pick up the Halfords XL Waterproof Picnic Blanket , \u0026pound10 (half price) so everyone can sit between matches.  If you are entertaining friends and family, chances are extra seating will be required - so grab a Folding Picnic Table with Stools for just \u0026pound25 (was \u0026pound40, save \u0026pound15). Plastic cups and plates are much safer when you\u0027re entertaining a large group, especially with the kids running around. Stock up on Plastic Plates , Plastic Bowls and Plastic Tumblers which come in packs of six for just \u0026pound3 each (half price).

Alex Musk, 30, proposed to Samm Sexton, 29, just two days after meeting her earlier this month. Samm had spent \u0026pound1,138 on flights from Indiana, USA, to the UK for a two-week trip to meet Alex after chatting on a Facebook community. The pair bonded for six months online after discovering they both had beloved Boston terriers named Lola.  And just days into the trip, Alex dropped down on one knee and popped the question during a romantic picnic in Leeds, West Yorks. I was beyond excited when Alex asked me to marry him - it just felt so right. During the time we were apart we\u0027d talk all day every day. In his lunch break he\u0027d call me and we were in constant contact, Samm said. The call centre worker flew back to the US on Thursday but is hoping to get a visa to stay in the UK permanently.  She added: I saw him then he looked up and saw me and I couldn\u0027t stop smiling. He was everything I\u0027d hoped he\u0027d be. It was amazing to get my arms around him finally. When he proposed I wasn\u0027t too surprised. I knew it was coming but I thought it was amazing. As for moving from the US to the UK, I\u0027m excited for it. It will be a huge difference but it\u0027s one I\u0027m ready for. My family and friends are very supportive. They will miss me of course but we will still visit and keep in touch.  The couple are now planning their wedding in which their beloved dogs, Alex\u0027s two-year-old and Samm\u0027s seven-year-old Boston terriers, will play starring roles. Alex, who is a disability support worker, said: Last Saturday we visited York overnight and I proposed to her then. I knew by January that I wanted to marry her but waited until we were together to pop the question. We went for a picnic at York Museum Gardens and I asked her then. It was an immediate yes. I bought the ring two months ago, it\u0027s a moonstone ring that Samm said she loved so I ordered it in secret. Her eyes lit up when I got down on one knee and her hands flew to her face.

Captain Chris Henkey did not follow standard procedures when his Boeing 777 caught fire on the runway at Las Vegas airport in September 2015. Passengers were unable to escape via two of the aircraft\u0027s exits because emergency slides were blown out of position by an engine which had not been shut down, US investigators found. A further four exits could not be used due to the blaze, meaning all 170 people on board had to leave through just two doors before smoke and fire engulfed the fuselage.  The left engine of the aircraft caught fire on September 8 2015 due to the engine failing during take off. The investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) found the blaze was caused by a fatigue crack in part of the engine - a General Electric model - which led to a fuel leak. Two seconds after hearing a bang, Captain Chris Henkey, from Reading, Berkshire, aborted the take-off, bringing the jet to a stop on the runway just 13 seconds later. He ordered passengers to evacuate from the right side of the plane, but the unaffected right engine continued to run for 43 seconds after his command, preventing two slides from being used.  The NTSB found that Mr Henkey did not use his quick reference handbook to read the evacuation checklist, attempting to perform the tasks from memory. He missed the second step, which was to ensure that both engines were shut down, according to the report. Because the captain did not follow standard procedures, his call for the evacuation checklist and the shutdown of the right engine were delayed. The last person left the aircraft two minutes and 32 seconds after the captain\u0027s initial command to evacuate.

Maybe that person is even you. There\u0027s a fine line, however, between being a chatterbox and alienating everyone around because of your incessant droning on and love-affair with the sound of your own voice. Conversation is a two-way street. You have to listen as well as be heard.  Sadly, not everyone has got this memo. Like Gary, for example, who came to stay with Reddit user Bri, and spent the duration of his visit talking about himself, talking over others, and not listening.  So Bri got her own back - and is now in dog house. My husband Will has a friend named Gary who arrived on Sunday night to stay with us for the week, she begins.  Gary and Will are friends from university and while they used be close, they\u0027ve not seen each other in years. Bri continues: This is the first time I\u0027ve met Gary. Three days into his visit and I\u0027m struggling, guys. Gary talks non-stop. We\u0027re not just talking about Gary being excited at seeing his old friend, and being gossipy and chatty. Oh no. As Bri explains: He literally talked (mostly about himself) throughout the entire dinner last night. He kept talking after dinner. He kept talking until we went to bed. He has an opinion about EVERYTHING. Will and I barely got any words in or got talked over. My husband could tell I was about to lose my cool by the time I excused myself for bed. Will apologised when he came to bed and says he remembered that Gary talked a lot but did not know he was going to do it incessantly and so rudely. So the couple hatched a plan and decided we would put more effort into speaking up/interjecting.    However, the next night, Gary had somehow managed to up his game.  Tonight, the three of us went out to try a new restaurant and it didn\u0027t go well, Bri continues. Gary kept trying to monopolise the conversation and would talk over me. I said \u0027EXCUSE ME, please allow me to finish\u0027, and he laughed and apologised because he \u0027knows he talks too much\u0027 and then KEPT TALKING. My husband then interjected and said, \u0027Gary I would like to hear what Bri has to say\u0027. So Gary apologised again and let me talk. But the victory was short-lived. When I finished, he nodded and then started continuing with whatever he was saying without acknowledging my point.  Bri had had enough. In her own words: I was done being polite at this point. I was mad and highly irritated. I had already had a couple of drinks and thought, \u0027F**k. This. Noise.\u0027 The the food arrived - and presented Bri with the perfect opportunity for revenge. Gary just sits there in front of his plate talking and talking. So I pushed my salad aside and grabbed his plate of untouched steak. And I started eating it. He stopped talking, looked stunned, and said, \u0027Bri, what are you doing?\u0027 I ignored him and kept eating his steak.  He looks kind of p****d and says, \u0027please stop eating my steak!\u0027 I ignored him and ignored Will\u0027s death stare and kept eating Gary\u0027s steak. I ate the whole thing. They watched me and Gary didn\u0027t speak a word the whole time and I got to eat in glorious silence. Then I apologised to Gary and said some s**t like, \u0027I know I eat too much and should have let him finish his steak. Gary tried to like...laugh it off? He didn\u0027t talk on the ride home. Unfortunately for Bri, she can\u0027t seem to catch a break.  Now her husband is beyond p****d at me and has asked me to apologise to Gary. I\u0027ve agreed to apologise because what I did was NOT the right way to handle the situation. My question is...how do I handle this for the rest of the week? Should I just stay away from him? Or is that being rude on top of my super rudeness? In this instance, no one thinks Bri is in the wrong - and it turns out A LOT of people know a Gary.

The hangar in the municipality of Ostend has protected architectural status and plans are in place to convert it into a brothel as the red light district in the seaside town is being cleared. The brothel will be known as Hangar d\u0027amour and will be run by the same company that manages a 51-bedroom in Antwerp called Villa Tinto. The plan will see the town\u0027s red light district, known as Hazegras, cleared and moved into the hangar. Prostitution is legal in Belgium and renting property for such work has been legal since 1995.  Around 26,000 women are believed to work in the sexy industry there. It is estimated that 80 per cent of sex workers are victims of people trafficking or are exploited by gangs. There has been opposition to the plan with a non-profit describing it as madness. The non-profit, Oostendse Oosteroever, have been campaigning for the building to be turned into a museum. However, the mayor - Johan Vande Lanotte - says the hangar will be a safer environment for sex workers. He said: “The ladies will enter into a rental contract directly with the owner, as a result of which intermediaries will be excluded.

Wildlife control experts were called to remove the serpents, which looked to be at least 4ft in length each, from inside the unit. And others say they\u0027ve pulled plenty of the reptiles from similar hiding places - but there is one simple way to stop it from happening. Yes folks, believe it or not, we’ve also pulled plenty of them out of dryer and exhaust vents, said Virginia Wildlife Management and Control, sharing a viral video of the two snakes being rescued. If you don’t have guards on yours, let us know and we’ll be happy to install one on them, so you will NEVER have to worry about this happening to you.  The one-minute 27-second clip shared on Facebook shows the moment a wildlife expert rips open the pipe of the tumble dryer, in what appears to be a family home at an unknown location. A snake is revealed and a horrified onlooker can be heard saying: I can see its head. A child in the background can he heard repeatedly shouting as the snake is discovered and removed, clearly surprised to see it there.  The creature is slowly pulled from the pipe but appears to resist, before curling up once removed entirely. Another child can be heard saying: Let\u0027s keep it as a pet. The snake is then placed inside a white plastic bucket, before the expert turns his attention to locating the second reptile. He quickly finds the marginally smaller snake inside another section of the machine, before using the same technique to remove it.

No one was an automatic pick, you had to play for your place.“Before he came to Dens Park it was like that, too many were.“When he came in there was a big clearout. He revolutionised the team.“A lot of the squad were ageing and just going through the motions at the end of their career.“At that time Dundee weren’t expected to do much, they were a big club but, after the success in the early 50s, there were a few years of doing not very much.“He also brought in some older guys who we all wondered about.“He brought in Bobby Wishart, who was 32 at the time, Bobby Seith was 30, but they were revelations.”Shankly also revolutionised the style of football on display at Dens Park.“We were an out-and-out attacking team,” Ure added.“We could defend when we needed to but we used to go at the opposition and test them.“We had a lot of seasoned players like Bobby Cox and Gordon Smith and some really good ones like Alan Gilzean and Alan Cousin. There was a perfect balance to the team.“We wanted to play football – there was no humping it up the pitch and chasing after it.“We were a possession-based team, one of the first in Scotland to keep the ball. It was a European style and that helped us in the European run the next season and why we did so well.“I think that foxed the European teams because they expected the usual Scottish kick and chase so they’d have the ball for 15 minutes at a time – the difference was we were keeping the ball!”That run in Europe saw the Dark Blues hammer Sporting Lisbon and then Anderlecht before falling to AC Milan in the last four.“The Anderlecht game was the best ever. We played at the Heysel Stadium and the whole ground clapped us off at the end, they all rose and clapped.“We were wondering what was happening. We played the stuff you see all great teams play and passed a good side off the park.“They were great days.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b2a29b42d531-435x564.jpg ","title":"125 years of dundee fc four of the very best to have pulled on dark blue","story":"\t\t\t\t\tFor what is a mid-sized club by Scottish standards, over their history it’s fair to say Dundee have punched well above their weight when it comes to producing and attracting top talent.In today\u0026#8217s look down memory lane, as we celebrate their 125th birthday, we highlight the very best of what has been a quality crop.Billy Steel: However long there is a Dundee FC, no list of the club’s greatest performers will ever be complete without the name Billy Steel.When director/manager George Anderson snapped the Scottish international inside-forward up from Derby County for a record £22,500 in September 1950, it went down as one of the transfer coups of the decade.Regarded as world class but known for being difficult to manage, Steel repaid the faith Anderson had shown in him and, in the next four years, would inspire Dundee to two League Cups.Steel left Dens in 1954 when he quit the senior game aged just 31. He moved to America where he died in 1982 but, 36 years later, remains regarded as one of Scotland’s greatest players.Claudio Caniggia: It was a case of 1950 and Billy Steel all over again when, in October 2000, Dundee sent tremors through the football world by announcing the signing of Argentine World Cup star Claudio Caniggia.In desperate need of a replacement for injured striker Fabian Caballero, the Dee’s Italian manager Ivano Bonetti used his Serie A connections and fixed up Caniggia, a former Roma team-mate of his brother and assistant Dario.In the end, the man who was Diego Maradona’s favourite strike partner for Argentina did not stay long at Dens Park, making just 21 league appearances and scoring seven goals, before heading for Rangers at the end of the 2000/01 campaign.Both for his performances and the gentlemanly way he conducted himself off the park, the impact he had on Dundee was considerably greater than the time he spent at Dens Park.Alan Gilzean: If there’s a debate over who the best-ever Dundee player is, when to comes to putting the ball in the net there can be no argument.Although down the years the club can boast some prolific scorers, there never has been, and is never likely to be, anyone who could match the ability of the legendary Alan Gilzean.Over 40 years after his playing career with the Dark Blues and then Spurs came to an end, those who saw him or played with or against him still regard him as being a world class centre-forward.Born in Coupar Angus, Dundee were his first senior club. He score an unequalled total of 169 goals for them and won the league in 1961/62 before being transferred to Spurs, where he enjoys similar legendary status, in 1964.Doug Cowie: The sands of time mean in some ways he is the forgotten man of Dundee greats but never to those who saw or played alongside Doug Cowie.Signed by George Anderson in 1945, over the next 16 years the Aberdonian would make a record 446 appearances, win two League Cups and also appear in two World Cups for Scotland.Cowie left Dens at the end of the season before the club won the championship but many of those who played in the side that clinched the title have often referred to the influence he had over their development on the pitch.As well as nurture it, Cowie would go on to show himself as an adept talent spotter. Once his playing days were over he worked for Dundee United and, along with fellow-scout Davie Small, was credited by Jim McLean as being instrumental in unearthing many of the local players who went on to bring the league flag to Tannadice in 1983.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b2781041b59a-126x180.jpg ","title":"125 years of dundee fc how did it all start for the dark blues","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAt times during their history, Dundee Football Club have proudly boasted of being the city’s oldest professional football club.While celebrations of their 125th birthday this year are confirmation of that, what the Dark Blues can’t claim to be is the first.Indeed, it was the growing popularity of the game late in the 19th century that led to their very existence, through the desire of smaller local outfits to challenge at a national level.The club was in some ways down to the existence of a man about whom little is known. He was Andrew Buttar, president of the Dundee Charity Football Association and, importantly, an official of one of the clubs already on the go in the city – Our Boys.Buttar felt that by joining forces with one of their big local rivals, East End, a new club representing the city as a whole would be capable of doing it proud at national league level.Perhaps surprisingly given the strong tribal nature of football even at that time and the fact an earlier attempt at amalgamation was thrown out by members of the clubs, within a month of him publicly airing the idea they’d met and put together an application for Scottish League membership.So it was that on June 12, 1893, at their AGM, the new Dundee Football and Athletic Club was admitted to the league.In doing so they beat off competition from Cowlairs and, more notably an Edinburgh-based outfit going by the name of Hibernian – whatever happened to them?With just two months to the start of the new season, there was plenty work to be done and, less than two weeks after the league vote, a committee, of which Buttar was vice-president, had been formed to run things.A home for the team had also to be found and, when hopes of playing at Carolina Port were dashed by another local side, Strathmore, obtaining the lease for it, Our Boys’ home at West Craigie Park, a ground that lay roughly between Albert Street and Morgan Street, was earmarked.Work to get it ready for the national league was hastily arranged and carried out. At the same time the committee set about putting together a team capable of competing at a higher level. For the most part that involved picking the best performers from East End and Our Boys, though Scotland cap Sandy Keillor and a team-mate from Montrose, goalie Billy McKie, were also brought in.So it was that, on August 12, barely three months on from the bid to form the club had gained real momentum, Dundee ran out to face Rangers at West Craigie Park on the first day of the new Scottish League season.The Gers were already a well- established league outfit and had secured their first title just two years earlier, so for Dundee to come from two goals down to earn their first league point from a 3-3 draw was a creditable performance.On top of the result, further vindication of the decision to move to the big stage came in the shape of a healthy 5,000 turnout for the game.After a-not-unexpected defeat at eventual champions Celtic the following week, a first win came in the second home game at the end of August when Renton were edged out 3-2.The 18-game campaign would yield a further five wins and two draws for an eighth-place finish and, although that meant they had to apply for re-election, the bid was successful. That first season also saw the team switch to first choice home Carolina Port, the ground many fans still believe was their original home.And if that first campaign couldn’t quite be described as auspicious, it was a start and the beginning of an eventful next 125 years.n Tomorrow – The Managers.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2015/06/image.jpg1_.741936.jpg ","title":"125 years of dundee fc humble claudio caniggia was even better off pitch barry smith","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA Dundee legend in his own right, Barry Smith captained the club for nine years before returning as manager in 2010.During that time he saw some of the best and some of the worst times in the history of the club.Among the best, however, was playing alongside some top-quality team-mates.And one name that stands out is Claudio Caniggia.Barry said: “I grew up watching guys like him play in World Cups, so I feel really fortunate to have played with Caniggia.“What made him stand out is, no matter how much he had done in the game before, he was so humble and had great humility.“What stood out for me is how he took time to help out the younger lads in training. Guys like Steven Milne and Graham Bayne owe a lot to him.“That was just the type of guy he is, very humble, no airs and graces and he took a lot of time with younger players that a lot of other players wouldn’t.“The first time he came in, he immediately made sure he was part of the team.“He didn’t just stand around, he got involved straight away.“Claudio didn’t want to be a superstar or anything, just wanted to be part of a team. His attitude was superb.“A lot of players could take a lesson from him. Every day he knew he still had to work hard.“I remember him as much off the park as on it because he was so good on the training ground.”Barry had another name he’d stick into the mix from his time at Dundee.“Georgi Nemsadze was the most technically gifted player I played with,” he added.“I knew when I won the ball, I could give it to him no problem.“I was very lucky to play alongside him.“I have to say, those guys did what they did because there were other guys in the team doing their jobs.“Guys like Lee Wilkie, Gavin Rae and me were the workhorses for the team and we allowed the players with all the flair to go and do their stuff.”As manager, Barry had to deal with some of the darkest times at Dens as the club headed into a second administration – the people at the club, however, managed to turn that time into one of the best at Dundee with the ‘Deefiant’ season.He added: “I do believe if the team hadn’t stayed up someone would have shut the doors at Dens.“Collectively everyone responded, the coaching staff, office staff, players and definitely the fans rallied around the club.“Though it was a really negative time, we turned it into a positive one which then led to promotion the following year.“I don’t like to single anybody out but Robert Douglas played a massive part.“It’s difficult to say just how much he helped gelling the players together.“All the players and their wives and families were invited round to his all the time and that really generated the team spirit.“He really made sure the team was a real team and that’s not even talking about what he did on the park.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/976302492.jpg-279x180.jpg ","title":"argentina cant expect messi to carry them says dundee hero caniggia","story":"\t\t\t\t\tFormer Dundee star Claudio Caniggia has urged the current Argentina side not to be a one-man team in Russia this summer.The Argentines got their World Cup campaign under way on Saturday against Iceland but could only manage a draw.Today they face Croatia and will hope to kick-start their campaign.Caniggia went to three World Cups – almost returning for a fourth at the age of 42 in 2010 – and arrived to much fanfare at Dundee in 2000.He says his country’s best chance of winning it all for the first time since 1986 is if Lionel Messi’s supporting cast step up to the plate.The 51-year-old rose to international prominence during the 1990 World Cup in Italy alongside Argentina great Diego Maradona and insists the difference between that side and today’s is the expectation on the other players.Caniggia said: “Messi doesn’t get the same support from his team-mates Maradona did.“I knew Maradona was the complete footballing genius but I didn’t think about keeping up with him. Never.“Every player has a responsibility, even those who don’t play much.“You can’t give all the responsibility to Messi, because then what’s the point of you being there?“Imagine if I’d thought in 1990 the world champions had to carry me through. No! Carry us? We’re in it together.“I’m Argentina’s striker and I have to drag them through it, too.“That was my responsibility. You’ve got to have character, determination, ambition and impulse.”Argentina are fifth in the betting to lift the trophy and Caniggia believes they can do it, particularly with the talent they have up top.With Messi, Gonzalo Higuain – who has come under fire for his performances for his country – Sergio Aguero, Paulo Dybala and Angel Di Maria to choose from, goals shouldn’t be a problem. Defensively, however, they could come unstuck.“What’s in our favour is the best attacking players can put fear into anyone,” added Caniggia.“Their names alone unsettle the opposition. The other teams don’t think ‘Higuain is being criticised in Argentina’. They think: ‘he’s Juventus’ top goalscorer’.”“Our weak point is we’re still not solid at the back, and there are still a couple of places up for grabs.”Caniggia was in his early thirties by the time he arrived at Dens Park in 2000 and remarkably had the chance to play at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa.“We’ll never know now but to play 30 minutes would have been perfect. I was in good shape and I hadn’t lost my pace. But I couldn’t decide, and later I regretted it. It would’ve been unbelievable to play.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/keepers-collage-300x180.jpg ","title":"csaba laszlo delighted as dundee united move to fix up giant goalkeepers","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee United have filled the void in the first line of their defence by fixing up two giant goalies from European football.With Harry Lewis back at Southampton after his year-long loan and Deniz Mehmet out for six months with a knee injury, it was no secret the Tangerines were in the market for goalkeepers.Now they’ve moved for Swiss goalie Benjamin Siegrist and Slovakian keeper Matej Rakovan. The pair, both of whom are 6ft 5in, have penned two-year deals.Now 26, Siegrist has played for Switzerland from U/17 to U/21 level and his list of previous employers include English trio Aston Villa, Cambridge and Wycombe.Most recently he’s been turning out for Lichtenstein outfit Vaduz in the Swiss Challenge League.Rakovan, 28, has U/21 caps for Slovakia and joins up from a spell in Czech football with FC Vysocina Jihlava, who he officially leaves tomorrow.“I am delighted to welcome Matej to the club,” said manager Csaba Laszlo“He has come through the excellent goalkeeping schools of Slovakia and the Czech Republic and is experienced at the top level.“He has had offers from other clubs and I am very pleased he has chosen us as he is ideally suited to the Scottish game.“Benjamin comes to Dundee United with a very good pedigree and is a large presence with good hands.”Austrian midfielder Christoph Rabitsch is also expected to join up this week, while former Celtic and Hearts striker Tony Watt is the latest name to be linked with a switch to the Tangerines.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee bus firm to unveil new greener fleet with free wifi and usb charging","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA Dundee bus firm has unveiled a £4 million fleet of new vehicles that it hopes will be a breath of fresh air to locals.Xplore Dundee’s 14 low-emission “Emerald” buses, as the firm calls them, are double deckers built by Falkirk manufacturers Alexander Dennis Ltd.As well as packing modern tech such as free wifi, USB charging and “next stop” announcements, the buses come with low-pollutant hybrid engines that emit fewer greenhouse gases.The new vehicles were showcased at Discovery Point by Xplore’s new managing director Christine McGlasson to mark Clean Air Day.Ms McGlasson said the buses would be on the streets by the autumn.“We take our role in recognising and reducing our city’s air quality issues very seriously,” she said.“We are therefore actively embracing clean technology in our fleet because we want to run buses that are green inside and out. This is our message on Clean Air Day 2018 as we look to the future: buses are not part of the problem – they are the solution to pollution.”Dundee is one of several Scottish cities that will introduce Low Emission Zones (LEZs) in the near future.LEZs will prevent older vehicles that do not meet strict emissions standards from entering certain parts of the city, in order to improve air quality and people’s health in the process.Health Secretary and Dundee East MSP Shona Robison and Dundee City Council’s city development convener Lynne Short were also at Discovery Point today.Ms Robison said: “This is a great boost to Dundee’s environmental credentials and will help to make our city greener.”Ms Short added: “Everyone benefits from better air quality but it is also everyone’s responsibility to think about their individual or corporate contribution and having a national Clean Air Day helps to do that in a very specific way.”Xplore plans to deploy most of its new vehicles on the service 22 route, which uses the city’s Seagate – one of Scotland’s pollution hotspots, according to air quality studies.It’s the latest step undertaken in Dundee to reduce vehicle emissions.The council already offers perks to electric vehicle owners, while European funding secured 12 hydrogen buses for city fleets in March.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee people octogenarian to graduate at

Kids were then asked to identify school costs which might create a barrier to participating in school.Among the issues addressed were breakfast clubs, uniform, lunches and snacks, school trips, homework and attitudes to poverty.The report found that uniform is one of the most expensive outlays for families, particularly replacing worn and torn clothes — and if families cannot afford to replace them, it can leave pupils embarrassed.Some pupils are also coming into school unfed – and inconsistencies in breakfast clubs across the city means that there aren’t always spaces for children in need.The timing of events, such as at Halloween and Christmas, was also leaving a dent in parents’ pockets, or leaving children excluded because their mums and dads can’t afford, for example, a Halloween costume.The Child Poverty Action Group, which conducted a similar exercise in Glasgow: “There is still some way to go to ensure that all children and young people from low income households are able to access all of the same opportunities as their peers.”One Dundee mum who knows how expensive it can be to send children to school is Sara Hay, 36, from Linlathen.Sara has one child Brandon Davidson in P1 at Rowantree Primary School and her son Findlay will start after the summer. She said: “There’s no doubt sending your kids to school is expensive. By the time you buy uniforms, shoes, bags and even pay for dress-down days, it’s a lot of money.“You often feel guilty because you maybe can’t afford to buy your children what others have, but it comes down to making the right choice.“Rowantree Primary is very good. We have a support group that runs a swap-shop, which is a great help. I also get support from my family.”Children and families service convener Councillor Gregor Murray said the report is a “hard-hitting” piece of research that raises a number of questions.Councillor Murray added said: “We raised the school clothing grant in Dundee to £100 in recognition of the struggles that families were facing.“Significant assistance from the Scottish Government has allowed us to make progress in narrowing the poverty attainment gap.“This report about the cost of the school day gives us many issues to think over and solutions need to be carefully considered.”The report highlights a number of examples of good practice to alleviate the economic barriers facing pupils.One of these is Craigie High School, where new first-year pupils are all given a pencil case filled with stationery so every youngster starts on the same footing.John Dickie, director of CPAG in Scotland, said: “Many Dundee schools and staff working in them are clearly sensitive to the fact that lots of families are struggling financially, and there is fantastic work happening across the city to keep school costs low and to support families where needed.“But cost barriers still remain and are preventing too many children from getting the most out of their education.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b2b713ac0e65-848x564.jpg ","title":"locals demand action over eyesore at old dundee nursery and play area","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA “neglected” piece of land next to a disused building in Fintry has been branded an eyesore by angry residents.Grass, bushes and trees next to the former nursery school on Fintry Road have been left to grow for about a year, locals said today.The nursery closed nine years ago, and despite previous applications to convert the building, no plans have come to fruition.The council-owned land also houses play equipment.Elspeth Muir, 66, a domestic worker with NHS Tayside, has lived at Fintry Mills, overlooking the site, for more than 30 years.

The playpark was used occasionally but not any more.”Retired couple Katherine and Brian Perrie, who also live at Fintry Mills, said the extent of the overgrown land meant they no longer opened the windows at the back of their Abertay Housing Association property.They said the land was initially maintained when they moved in six years ago but it had become particularly overgrown in the past two years.Katherine, 67, added: “It’s been like that for a while.“As far as I can remember, the council has cut the grass once in about two years.

Doors to the concert venue open at 4pm.Steps are the first big name to play Slessor Gardens this year, ahead of Rita Ora’s performance in July and Simple Minds arriving in September.Last year, Little Mix, Olly Murs and UB40 all performed there.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2016/09/57cfe1c2dde84-409x400.jpg ","title":"the tele guide to the world cup group hs local links","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThe first round of World Cup fixtures is almost over with Group H set to get under way today.Colombia might be the dark horses for the tournament and Poland boast one of the world\u0026#8217s top sharpshooters in Robert Lewandowski, Senegal have Liverpool\u0026#8217s Sadio Mane while Japan might have a former United keeper between the sticks.The Tele looks at the final set of countries and how they \u0026#8211 some tenuously \u0026#8211 are linked to both city clubs.GROUP HColombiaAnother nation with a golden generation, much is expected of this Colombia side back home.Four years ago, led by talisman James Rodriguez, they entertained their way to the quarter-final where they lost out to hosts Brazil in controversial fashion.This time around they find themselves in a group of unfancied teams which could give them the platform for another run into the knockout stages.With players like James, Radamel Falcao, Juan Cuadrado and Tottenham’s Davinson Sanchez, they possess quality throughout the squad.Star player: James Rodriguez.Local link: Colombia were invited to take on Scotland and England in the 1988 Rous Cup and arrived in the UK with stars like Carlos Valderrama, Rene Higuita and the tragic Andres Escobar, who was later murdered after scoring an own goal at the 1994 World Cup.A Dundee United player at the time, Kevin Gallacher played the full 90 minutes at Hampden as the teams played out a 0-0 draw and Scotland finished third out of three.JapanA mainstay of recent World Cups, Japan are looking to repeat their appearances in the knockout rounds in 2002 and 2010 after failing to win a game in 2014.With the experienced Keisuke Honda helped by former Manchester United man Shinji Kagawa, Japan have the guile to open teams up for Leicester’s Shinji Okazaki to finish.Star player: Shinji Kagawa.Local link: Dundee United fans won’t have fond memories of him – Dundee fans might – but goalkeeper Eiji Kawashima goes into this World Cup with the No 1 jersey.Signed by Mixu Paatelainen at Tannadice, Kawashima signed to regain his place in the national side but failed to perform as the club suffered relegation.The 35-year-old now plays for French top-flight club Metz.PolandThe Poles sailed to qualification for this one through a tough group that included Denmark, Montenegro and Romania thanks to a record goals haul of 16 by Robert Lewandowski.When they do qualify for World Cups, Poland tend to do well with two third-place finishes to their name.Those came in 1974 and 1982 but they’ve not made it out of the group stage since 1986.With one of the most lethal finishers in the tournament, they could surprise a few.Star player: Robert Lewandowski.Local link: Impressive goalkeepers have been the main export to the city from Poland for United but two outfielders come to mind at Dens.Dariusz Adamczuk and Pietor Czachowski arrived at Dundee in 1993 but couldn’t prevent relegation – Adamczuk would be fondly remembered in his second spell, returning in 1996 before departing for Rangers in 1999. He played 11 times for Poland while Czachowski picked up 45 caps.The ‘Mad Monk’ Grzegorz Szamotulski, Lukasz Zaluska and Rado Cierzniak were all top goalies at Tannadice while Jaroslaw Fojut had a decent spell in 2014-15. They have 15 caps between them.SenegalJust their second appearance at a finals since they exploded on to the scene in 2002 by beating world champions France in the opener in South Korea.The West Africans would love to repeat their run to the last eight then and will fancy their chances of getting out of this group.Star player: Sadio Mane.Local link: French-born Morgaro Gomis played more than 200 games for Dundee United over two spells.Now 32, Gomis plays in Malaysia but picked up two international caps with Senegal in 2009 while at Tannadice.Yet again Scotland won’t be there but, with just one sleep until the big kick-off, all eyes are now firmly fixed on the World Cup in Russia.The action starts tomorrow when the hosts take on Saudi Arabia in Moscow’s Luzhniki Stadium.Tonight the Tele’s build up concludes with our lowdown on the final section, Group H, possibly the least fashionable of all the groups, hipsters apart.Trying not to leave you feeling too left out by the Tartan Army’s absence, we’ll also provide a local link, tenuous or otherwise, to each participating

The connection with the charity came about because Andrew is father-in-law to a friend of Emily Crossley, a former reporter and anchor for Channel 4 News and CNN International, who co-founded the charity in 2012 after her son Eli was diagnosed with Duchenne muscular dystrophy. (DMD)Emily has advocated for patients around the world and spoken many times in the Houses of Parliament.The trust raised \u0026pound3.5million in its first three years, and then six years ago started the annual Duchenne Dash, which with big sponsors such as Maserati, brings in millions for research and also raises awareness of the horrible disease. Last year\u0027 Dash raised \u0026pound1 million.DMD is an inherited genetic disorder passed on by the mother that leads to progressive muscle degeneration and weakness.

A platform comes out on to the pavement, with a holding bar, and is then raised up to floor level. This is designed as a wheelchair lift, where two seats at the front have to be arranged to be taken out, to give plenty of room.It was agreed, however, that if someone felt nervous about climbing up or down the stairs, they could also use the access platform.

If you are involved in a community-run or farming support project and think your organisation may benefit – or if you know someone who might –  visit  www.princescountrysidefund. org.uk/grants.The fund has supported a diverse range of projects, including a community transport app in Argyll and projects on Barra, Orkney and Shetland. We are proud to have distributed more than £9 million since 2010 to more than 250 projects led by these grassroots organisations.It is crucial we help rural areas during these times of change to retain a thriving countryside and encourage a sustainable farming sector in the UK and would encourage people to apply for our funding.Claire Saunders, director, The Prince’s Countryside Fund.Sir,At first sight, it seems odd that the controversy over the reported disturbance to common gulls, oystercatchers and black guillemots at the old oil depot in Ardrishaig is focused on a breeding colony of common gulls.I’m no bird expert and hadn’t realised common gulls are less common than the bigger varieties or that they’re a declining species.But among the reasons given for this are predation by mink and the loss of open rubbish dumps and both might be contributing factors in Mid Argyll.It’s surely hardly surprising that the only breeding colony along the canal is at the Ardrishaig end, where the urbanisation around the tidal flats of Loch Gilp and the Lingerton dump offer prime scavenging opportunities.I don’t know whether they lose out to the bigger gull species when it comes to local island nesting sites, or whether the old Gleaner site might offer other advantages, for example, maybe less vulnerable to mink predation – but could it be the gulls are there primarily because of man-made feeding opportunities and that they’ll find an alternative site that’s similarly convenient?Likewise, the smaller populations of oystercatchers and black guillemots, however, although they’re also both amber listed they don’t scavenge and seem to be more dependent on the sea and shore for their livelihoods.Their decline might be of more concern but they’re hopefully less swayed towards easy pickings around Loch Gilp and more evenly distributed to Loch Crinan.Perhaps Jim Dickson and Andrew Tongue can enlighten us further on just how endangered the populations of these three species are in Mid Argyll.Robert Wakeham, Lochgilphead.Sir,Please would the parents of the young girl who may have witnessed a recent incident with a man and dog in Inveraray Main Street contact my husband and I through this newspaper?We saw a man who, we believe, mistreated a dog in the street at 8.30pm on Sunday April 29.We are both keen to know this young person is alright as she appeared to be frightened, running off at speed with her two dogs.Knowing she was fine would put our minds at rest. We can still see her face full of horror and hear her cry.Otherwise we had a lovely holiday. You have a most beautiful part of the country to live in.Name and address supplied.Sir,It has been announced recently a Scottish Conservative government would invest £100 million into fixing potholes over the course of the next parliament.We all rely on our roads but they are now plagued with potholes which are damaging cars. Beyond our concerns for public safety, this systematic under-investment is slowing our economy and costing local councils a fortune in compensation for car owners.We recognise the importance of well-maintained roads and we are willing to invest in it.The SNP has consistently neglected Scotland’s roads and the results are obvious for everyone to see.Councillor Alastair Redman, Islay.On Monday May 14, I spotted six swallows over the rear of Meadows Place, hopefully heralding a decent summer.First seen this year.Mike Power, Lochgilphead.Sir,During this week\u0026#8217s Holyrood vote on the UK Government’s Withdrawal Bill, Labour, the Greens and LibDems joined the SNP in an overwhelming rejection of the UK Government’s currently-drafted Brexit plans, voting 93 to 30 against the bill.While the Scottish Government agrees in the need for UK-wide frameworks, it has described the retention of the overall control of agriculture, fisheries, food labelling and public procurement as a power grab.The Scottish Parliament has spoken loudly and clearly, and if the UK Government wants us to believe they value Scotland and devolution, they must respect the vote and remove the proposed power grab.Any constraints placed on the existing powers of the Scottish Parliament without consent would be a democratic outrage.During Prime Minister\u0026#8217s Questions, Theresa May failed to reassure us she will respect the decision of the Scottish Parliament. If she does choose to ignore the vote and force through this legislation, she will be breaking the conventions of the 20-year-old devolution settlement and imposing a power grab upon Scotland against our will.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 21/05/18, 3:33 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Some would argue it has been an eyesore that should have been knocked down long before now and replaced with a more modern building.But it\u0026#8217s sad to see the old Inveraray Community Hall crumble and rot with neglect.What makes the building\u0026#8217s current predicament all the more galling is that there was the chance, according to Inspire Inveraray, to make the building safe six years ago.

As with other gull species which are opportunist in diet, junk food and bits of plastic provided by us humans can be inadvertently consumed.Over many years the Gleaner oil depot, which has a concrete bund in case of oil spillage, has provided a safe nesting site for around 20 pairs. The suggestion that this colony could easily find an alternative site is perhaps wishful thinking as suitable sites nearby in Mid Argyll are already occupied by other gull species or don’t have the required habitat features.Thankfully, however, this should not prove necessary. Following a productive on-site meeting last week with the Scottish Canals\u0026#8217 environmental scientist, the project architect and TSL contractors we noted 10-15 birds sitting on eggs and unaffected by the work going on around them.Planned works over the coming weeks should not affect these gulls, Oystercatchers or Black Guillemots from nesting and will also not impede the building work which is scheduled to be completed by next spring.The Mid Argyll hub project and new canal museum will largely reflect the social and cultural heritage of the Crinan Canal, but should also encompass the important and often decreasing natural history of the Crinan Canal corridor. These breeding birds are also a part of this and should not just be something to ‘chase off’ to somewhere else.Excellent viewing and educational opportunities from the new build will be possible to watch this colony raise their chicks as well as providing a point to lookout for other wildlife on the loch.Nearby, the tidal estuary of Loch Gilp provides us with an often highly under-valued unofficial nature reserve that links Ardrishaig with Lochgilphead, which in winter hosts important numbers of duck and waders, in summer includes breeding Eider ducks and Common Terns and during migration is a vital stopping off point during adverse weather for passage Whooper swans, Brent geese and Black-tailed Godwits to name a few.Increasingly good work is being undertaken by locals and the Phoenix Trust to help clear up some of the increasing amounts of shoreline rubbish.Keep up the good work!Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,I have been out and about Islay the past week speaking to my constituents, visiting local businesses and monitoring the roads department\u0026#8217s progress with road repairs.Unfortunately CalMac management\u0026#8217s shocking handling of our local ferry service is really taking it\u0026#8217s toll on many local businesses that depend heavily of Islay\u0026#8217s growing tourist trade. We simply cannot allow CalMac to continue to make the same errors every year without consequences.On another subject, I have been unimpressed with our local roads department management\u0026#8217s sluggish response to a large number of complaints from local residents and myself about the plague of potholes scattered across Islay.There are many roads across Islay that have some potholes marked to be filled while others remain unmarked despite them in many cases being side by side. This scattershot approach to pothole repairs is as random as it is ineffective.In the future we will need to see a more long term resurfacing solution to our local roads with less short term, random and piecemeal patchwork.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,In the run up to National Volunteering Week (June 1- 7), Cats Protection would like to extend our thanks to the many thousands of volunteers throughout the country who offer their time and expertise to help cats and kittens across the UK.In 2017, our 10,200-strong volunteer network contributed an incredible 5.5 million hours, each volunteer gifting a wealth of expertise and immeasurable passion to the charity. Their dedication enabled Cats Protection to help around 200,000 cats and kittens nationwide.Cats Protection is always on the lookout for new volunteers to join the UK’s biggest cat community. Though a large part of our work is helping cats, through fostering and rehoming, our volunteers have the opportunity to become involved with a range of interesting activities such as organising fundraising events, helping with publicity or managing funds and resources to benefit the greatest amount of cats.Volunteering can offer the chance to develop skills such as time management, interpersonal skills and teamwork, making CVs much more attractive and, of course, helping cats.Anyone who is interested in becoming a volunteer can go to our website www.cats.org.uk/get- involved/volunteering  to find out more.Julie Meredith, head of volunteering development, Cats Protection,Sir,I really love being active, especially the feeling after and that’s why I’m supporting Bowel Cancer UK and Beating Bowel Cancer’s latest fundraising campaign to get sponsored to do 30 minutes of physical activity for 30 days in June.Step up for 30 is a fantastic way for you to be more physically active to reduce your risk of bowel cancer – the UK’s second biggest cancer killer.

In fact many of the passing ferry passengers stopped to watch from the road.The new timing equipment, purchased with aid of a grant from Tarbert and Skipness Community Trust, was in full use by judge Mairi Henderson and made for more professional accuracy in timing aspects.The final Grand Prix had only two competitors but it was a masterclass of style and competence from Jojo and Katie which made it a joy to watch.As usual the event ended with some fast and exciting games and after the field was cleared there was the prizegiving in the Pony Club’s brand new blue tent.The Junior Trophy for the day was won by Louise Ralston from Campbeltown and Iris McMillan from Tayvallich took the Senior Trophy for a second year while the non-members trophy was won by Andrea McShannon.Pony Club PonyClass 11 Frazer Prentice, Firefly2 Louise Ralston, Nero3 Rory Shaw, Libby4 Jake Rowan, AliceClass 21 Willow Ryan, Ryan2 Zoe Prentice, Cowal3 Isla McShannon, ColeyClass 31 Iris McMillan, Conker2 Katie MacKay, Eva3 Josephine Boase, ValerieClass 41 Andrea McShannon, Nicole2 Julie McLeish, Eclipse3 Shelagh Oakes, Pery4 Catriona Ryan, DoneyShow JumpingStars of the Future \u0026#8211 Lead Rein1 Louise Ralston, Nero2 Frazer Prentice, Firefly3 Rory Shaw, Libby4 Jake Rowan, AliceStars of the Future1 Iris McMillan, Conker2 Zoe Prentice, Cowal3 Isla McShannon, Coley4 Willow Ryan, RyanNewcomers1 Iris McMillan, Conker2 Andrea McShannon, Nicole3 Michelle McAloon, Eclipse4 Catriona Ryan, DoneyDiscovery1 Josephine Boase, Valerie2 Andrea McShannon, Nicole3 Katie MacKay, Eva4 Michelle McAloon, EclipseGrand Prix1 Josephine Boase, Valerie2 Katie MacKay, Eva\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 07/06/18, 4:46 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.This week\u0026#8217s photograph comes from Jacqui Barker of Tarbert.

The pair were seeded car 30 in the two wheel drive section, run first on the day in a new schedule being piloted by the rally, the two wheel drive cars covering the stages before the four wheel drive cars followed in the afternoon.With the dry conditions in the weeks running up to the event dust would be the main problem for those running further down the field. Douglas attacked the first stage, Twiglees, and was catching the car in front when, unfortunately due to the dust being created by that car, came out of a 90 degree corner with zero visibility and connected heavily with a rock, damaging the suspension and forcing his early retirement.The car, and the driver, are noticeably quicker  each event they compete in and it\u0026#8217s only a matter of time before the results are there.The other Argyll car out on the stages was Ally Currie from Mull and Grant McNiven in the Ford Fiesta ST picking up 9th overall and 1st in Class 6.The next round of the Scottish Championship is Argyll Rally, based in Dunoon on June 23 \u0026#8211 the closest round for most Argyll rally enthusiasts and one not to be missed. The stages look absolutely breathtaking this year and well worth a watch.The Scottish Tarmac Rally Championship continues as well with round three being the Granite at Leuchars Stages hosted by Aberdeen and District Motor Club at the MOD base in Leuchars, Fife.Argyll was well represented both in the drivers seat and the co-drivers. All Argyll crew Willie and Steven Beattie were out in the newly finished and beautifully finished Escort MkII. They were absolutely flying and really getting to grips with the car when a sixth gear lock-up threw them into a spin and off the stage, clouting a fairly substantial fence post in the process.The navigators side now looks decidedly second hand, but nothing a few hours in the workshop won\u0026#8217t sort. A bent bottom suspension arm put paid to them re-joining but they will take the positives and the blistering pace into the next round for sure.Willie Beattie Snr in his equally exquisite Escort was also beginning to get the hang of the car, with some more seat time this year, not to mention experienced co-driver, Phil Sandham, pushing him on. He, after making sure his boys were okay when they didn\u0026#8217t show up at service after their spin, continued on to secure 12th overall and second in class: his first honours since building the car.The next round may see some family ties severely stretched, at least until the final results are announced.Ian Parker was also out in familiar machinery, co-driving for Fraser Smith in his Canal Garage-prepared Honda Civic. The pair were also making good progress up the class rankings until the diff decided to implode and finished their rally on Stage six.The drive of the day was not in question. Alan Kirkaldy led from start to finish despite some interesting issues in the first test. His door came loose after about a third of stage and he continued, holding the door shut by the open window whilst steering, changing gear and waving with the other.Astonishingly he still managed quickest stage time by five seconds. His co-driver for the day could forgive himself for being a little green about the gills after that.Eoghan Anderson from Cairnbaan was lucky enough to win the seat in a charity auction at the Annual STRC Dinner earlier in the year. An experience he is unlikely to forget in a hurry, although some of the memories may be a little bit blurry and perhaps just a little sideways. The top three were rounded out by Ian Forgan, ably guided round in his Subaru by his daughter in her first rally and the final position on the podium went to Ian and Allan Paterson, also in a Subaru.The next round is this weekend at Crail where the Beattie boys will be back out, Ian Parker swaps a Civic for an Escort MKII and Donald Bowness is set to get back out in the Nova.PICS:Photos: Gavin Brown, West Coast PhotosRed Escort (Car 1) Alan Kirkaldy/Eoghan Anderson (first overall) no_a24rally01\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"high tech preparation for mid argyll art show","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 14/06/18, 7:45 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThis year has seen a lot of preparatory work ahead of the 2018 Mid Argyll Art Society exhibition in August.The popular show will again be held in the Drill Hall, Lochgilphead and will run from August 6-11.As in the last few years, the Mid Argyll Camera Club will have photos on display.The society is harnessing modern technology in a campaign to raise the profile of this year\u0026#8217s event.There is now a Mid Argyll Art Society Facebook page that can be used to get updates on what is happening.There will shortly be a website giving details about the art society, its history, information on the exhibition and how to participate, and photos of past exhibits to give a flavour of what the event is like.A lot of work has been done on modernising the entry process.

Now scientists from the University of Aberdeen have added a third species to the mix \u0026#8211 the European pine marten. These native squirrel predators are recolonising Britain after years of persecution, and so the scientists set out to uncover the impact of this on red and grey squirrel populations.Three study sites in Scotland were in the Highlands (marten recolonisation for over 45 years, no grey squirrels), Central Scotland (marten recolonisation for 8-14 years, grey squirrels since 1945) and the Borders (early stages of marten recolonization, grey squirrels since 1980).Populations were monitored for five months using cameras and multi-species feeders \u0026#8211 the latter with glue strips on the underside of the lid to obtain visitor hair samples. This material provided DNA to determine visitor species and identify individual martens.The results showed that while red squirrels avoided feeders used by martens, greys were equally likely to use feeders whether frequented by martens or not. So grey squirrel numbers were reduced where exposure to pine martens was high, whereas numbers of red squirrels increased – unequivocal evidence that recovering marten numbers affect competition between red and grey squirrels.This finding is likely explained by the fact that reds, having co-evolved with martens, instinctively avoid areas used by martens but invasive greys, having no such instincts, showed no avoidance behaviour at all.Since pine martens’ range is increasing and extending southwards, scientists are optimistic that this will control the invasive grey squirrel species.As they say in the title to their report, in this case ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend’.PIC:The native grey squirrel may have an unlikely ally.

We simply don\u0026#8217t have enough children playing shinty in each school to make up separate clubs.Surely, in 2018, this shouldn\u0026#8217t be allowed to happen?It is only three clubs that are being affected by this, and they\u0026#8217re all in the south of Scotland,  half way through a season, leaving all our kids devastated at the though of losing their chosen sport.My son has been playing shinty since Primary One. He is now heading into Primary Four and is even more passionate about the sport. He enjoys quality team time, striving to be the best he can and just loving playing the game.It\u0026#8217s very difficult to explain something like this to an eight-year-old child, never mind the Primary One children we have in our club.One quote from a child was: \u0026#8216Everyone is going to be so sad if we don\u0026#8217t have shinty. Why would shinty people do this to us?\u0026#8217It\u0026#8217s a very sad day indeed for the children of Argyll and Bute who are simply being punished for what school they go to and where they live. We have to stand together and fight for our club and our children.The Camanachd Association needs to step up and find a solution to allow all children to compete nationally and stand as one united shinty community.Ailsa and Alastair Crawford, LochgilpheadSir,The Camanachd Association has put politics before the needs of the children and the development of the sport in Argyll.The kids are disappointed and the coaches who have worked tirelessly to set the club up are deflated. Surely the association knows this is a mistake that needs rectified immediately.Personally, Kilmory and Dunadd children\u0026#8217s club has inspired our son and daughter to get involved with the sport and to grow in confidence amongst other like-minded children.Stuart and Simone Charnock, LochgilpheadSir,My son has trained with Kilmory/Dunadd shinty club since he was in Primary One. The club has always treated the kids equally and welcomed all kids to participate.After years of hard work, the team was progressing well and was worthy of competing at national level.In his last year before high school, to be told he is no longer allowed to play is not only devastating to my son but greatly confusing and he is left wondering what he has done wrong.I fail to see how this can be classed as progress by the Camanachd Association. This needs to be readdressed to allow kids to compete in the game they love.Susan Jackson, LochgilpheadI was very angry to hear from local residents in Portnahaven that their recycling bins have been used by numerous motorhomes for disposing of general waste, including food waste.I have visited the recycling bins site in Portnahaven and spoken to my constituents in person about this and I can confirm that unfortunately Portnahaven\u0026#8217s recycling bins are full of general waste.This is as unacceptable as it is disrespectful. I have contacted the appropriate department with the council and asked for an investigation to be done. I also asked for some addition signage for the bins area.I made it very clear that my constituents should not lose their recycling facilities as a result of their bins being misused by someone else.I will continue to monitor this situation and provide an update as soon as I have more information.Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,It is fitting to mark this Diabetes Week (June 11-17) for Scotland’s 30,000 adults and children living with type one diabetes by noting that life-changing monitors are now available on the NHS.A child diagnosed with type one diabetes at five faces 50,000 finger prick blood glucose tests by the time they are 18.Each painful finger prick is part of a daily routine which also includes calculating carbohydrate intake and frequent insulin injections, all to prevent life-threatening hypoglycaemia and long term complications.But since November last year, a \u0026#8216flash glucose monitoring\u0026#8217 system called the Freestyle Libre can be prescribed by local GPs, offering an alternative to such intensive finger-pricking.The roll out of flash glucose monitoring, which gives a reading via a simple sensor, however, is not consistent across all local health boards. So, our message for Diabetes Week is to call for health boards in Scotland to speed up prescription policies and step up much needed prescriptions.As someone who has lived with type one diabetes for 21 years, new technology, such as the FreeStyle Libre, makes a world of difference.Type one diabetes cannot be prevented and until we find the cure for it, research and technology are vital.Holly Davies, development manager, Aberdeen\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"a poignant prizegiving for tarbert afc","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 20/06/18, 6:08 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowTarbert AFC’s annual football dance was held on Saturday June 16 in the Islay Frigate Hotel.Players and their partners were joined by the wider circle of people who are involved with the club.This annual dinner dance is also the end of season awards presentation.Nikki MacDougall took home awards for Top Goal Scorer and Referees\u0026#8217 Player of the Year.

South Ayrshire councillors will launch a bid to scrap their own controversial rule, the Post can reveal. We told last week how the three-year-old policy is being labelled a threat to small businesses. Now councillors are ready to intervene in the row. Labour’s Phil Saxton, who represents Troon, is to table a motion before colleagues calling for a rethink.  He said: “The word we’re looking for here is compromise. “I don’t think the relevant detail was considered when this policy was first introduced. “The ability to enforce something like this will always be very difficult.” Cllr Saxton is now expected to lead calls for a ‘mixed’ smoking zone outside cafes or bars which use council-owned pavements. He said: “We could look at 50 per cent of the tables smoking and 50 per cent not. “I don’t think that’s an unreasonable solution. “Right now I’m looking at gathering support and hopefully the vote will go our way.”  That vote is scheduled to take place on June 28 when the council holds its last full meeting before the summer recess. It’s understood members are currently divided on the issue, which was introduced under the council’s last administration. The new move comes as the Post reported last week how furious cafe bosses said their business was under threat because of the “crazy”council law. Nino and Karen Pajovic insisted a smoking ban outside their Cafe Le Monde premises in Ayr was costing them thousands Said Nino: “A compromise along these lines would be perfect and is surely the common sense approach.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12385832.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/emp_ayp_200317mackay_02JPG.jpg","title":"campaign save sanctity loans set","story":"NewsCampaign to save sanctity of Loans set to end in victoryFor the first time it emerged a developer WAS behind the plan, rather than, as was insisted, South Ayrshire Council officers just selected it as a prospect.\u0026nbspShareByLochlin Highet11:47, 15 JUN 2018NewsLand earmarked for housing in 2014 adjacent to Loans (Image: Euan McCall/Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA strong campaign to save the sanctity of the village of Loans is set to end in victory. Villagers - and residents across the greenbelt in Muirhead - mounted a stiff rearguard action after a bid to get it zoned for housing. For the first time it emerged a developer WAS behind the plan, rather than, as was insisted, South Ayrshire Council officers just selected it as a prospect. Senior SNP councillor Craig Mackay said on Tuesday it was now “highly unlikely” it would make the next stage. And he told Troon Community Council : “No decisions have been made and we are not out of the woods yet with the Muirhead-Loans site yet. “But on the basis the available land pretty much matches what we need for new housing over the next five years, there should be no need for any release of greenbelt sites. “It is highly unlikely it will be built on.” We revealed the secret plan for the soggy 30 acre field in October, which would link the medieval clachan to the town of Troon. It sparked an emergency meeting of Loans Community Council and the public packed out Troon Community Council meetings.  And at the time town councillor Peter Convery said: “That ground is sacrosanct and it should never have been suggested for the local plan.” Planners were promoting the sight, saying the “layouts of both settlements turn their backs twoards each other at the moment and this doesnt create an attractive approach to either of them.” Councillor Mackay said the house sites currently available “pretty much” matched the demand. And he revealed South Ayrshire Council has now taking a slightly different approach from the developer-led schemes. He added: “Brownfield land will be prioritised even though that is not as lucrative for developers.” Councillor Mackay also revealed a developer had been circling on the Loans site - despite insistence from council officers there was no developer. He said:”Planning officers gave assurances there was no developer.. but there was.”  The breakthrough has been hailed by David Chalmers, chairman of Loans Community Council. He said: “It is obviously encouraging hearing Councillor McKay’s statement that development be allowed on the greenbelt between Loans and Muirhead is unlikely to be adopted in LDP2. “We will, of course, anxiously await SAC’s verification of this which we understand will not be until nearer the end of this year. “Every praise should be given to the overwhelming response given by the residents of Loans and Muirhead - a 367 signature petition and 246 letters - which clearly demonstrated the level of feeling against.” South Ayrshire Council said the process to publish the new Development Plan was still active. A spokesman said: “There are a range of issues that are suggested, discussed and determined. This is a very thorough process to ensure that all stakeholders are given due consideration. As a result, we’ll only be able to give assurance of what is included in, or excluded from the proposed plan when a report is considered by the Council later this year.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnScottish National PartySouth Ayrshire CouncilTroonAyrAyr News"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"girl 4 stuck playpark equipment","story":"NewsGirl, 4, gets stuck in playpark equipment and needs fire brigade to rescue herPetrified Lily-Mags Rodman ended up wedging her wee leg in a metal car in Belleisle near Ayr.\u0026nbspShareBySarah Hilley16:44, 20 JUN 2018Updated19:45, 20 JUN 2018NewsLittle Lily-Mags had her leg stuck in the toy car for 40 minutes\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA four-year-old girl got stuck in playpark equipment for 40 minutes as firefighters struggled to get access to her. Petrified Lily-Mags Rodman ended up wedging her wee leg in a metal car in Belleisle. Her father David and other parents were unable to free her, sparking an emergency services rescue. But crews faced a major delay as access to the park through the main entrance was blocked off due to fencing at the Belleisle Hotel. The crew had to abandon their fire engine some distance away and run across the grass to reach Lily-Mags. After assessing the situation, they were forced to backtrack their appliance through the main exit and find another way in.  Mum Clare said: “Luckily my daughter wasn’t badly hurt, but if it was a life-or-death situation and a child had fallen from equipment it may have been too late.” Clare, who was working from home outside Ayr, rushed to the park after her husband phoned. Clare, 33, said: “I drove in a panic. “Her leg was wedged in the car at a funny angle. “I could hear her screaming over the phone. My husband and others tried to get her out but it hurt so they called the fire brigade.” Firefighters calmly cut off the side of the car to free the tot.  She emerged unscathed but with bad pins and needles during the incident a week past last Wednesday. Now Clare and Lily-Mag’s gran Anita O’Connor are calling for an emergency services route to the wooded park. Clare said: “The fire service were really fantastic but it took them 10 minutes to figure out how to get the fire engine in.” Anita said: “She was stuck for well over 40 minutes as the fire engine couldn’t find a route through to the park because of the fencing. “Fortunately she has not sustained any injuries, but she is extremely traumatised. “This issue regarding access needs to be addressed ASAP and not sat on for days until the council have their next meeting.”  Belleisle Hotel owner Campbell Inns erected more fencing on June 6, which has blocked off access to the playpark through the main driveway. The alternative entrance is now through Greenfield Avenue. Anita said emergency services should have been notified of the issue. A council spokesman said: Due to layout changes affecting the main access road at Belleisle, emergency services had to enter via an alternate route. “We are contacting the emergency services to advise them to use the alternative entrance for the time being.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"pair young lads saved squirrel","story":"NewsPair of young lads saved squirrel that was lying in agonyNow the caring boys - Max Bryson and Ben Edwards - have been praised for their caring capers.\u0026nbspShareByStephen Houston10:10, 21 JUN 2018NewsMax Bryson, left and Ben Edwards (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA squirrel lay in agony after plunging from a tree in a park ... only to be protected and saved by two young lads. Now the caring boys - Max Bryson and Ben Edwards - have been praised for their caring capers. And Ben’s dad James said: “I am immensely proud of them both. “Too often people these days would just walk past and, although concerned, would not intervene. “Ben and Max got stuck in and worked out a rescue plan.” The 12-year-olds, who have just started second year at Kyle Academy, had been out cycling in Rozelle Park last Tuesday.  They came across the bashed-up critter at the side of the duck pond and sprang into action. Onlooker Lorna Barclay said the boys deserve recognition. She said: “The squirrel was obviously hurt and fretting on the path. “We approached to see if we could help but were pleasantly surprised they had the situation under control.” They had already called the SSPCA and protected the frightened furry animal from dogs. When the charity said they’d be an hour the boys went home and got a strong bag filled with straw - leaving Lorna on guard.  And Max’s mum Liz and dad Douglas, who own the Inverlea Guest House in Ayr, said: “He loves animals so wanted to help. “I am so happy both boys decided to intervene. “They did it all on their own and I knew nothing about it. “What the lady said about the boys was amazing.” The lads returned to the squirrel within 15 minutes with their custom-made bed all ready for the SSPCA inspector. Lorna added: “It was lovely to see how concerned and compassionate the boys as well as using their problem- solving skills.  “Many other people would have walked on by without any interest in helping.” Ben already has a busy household with dad James, mum Sarah, sisters Lizzie and Emily, two cats, a tortoise and a fish. Scottish SPCA Chief Superintendent Mike Flynn said: “At this time of year we receive a lot of calls about people concerned about wildlife. “We all have a responsibility to look after and care for the wildlife in Scotland and these two boys went above and beyond on this occasion to help this poor squirrel. “They should be very proud.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12713526.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/emp_ayp_070618ecrepont_10JPG.jpg","title":"talented youngster finn ecrepont walking","story":"NewsTalented youngster Finn Ecrepont is walking on AyrDubbed a hot prospect with a bright future, the local Ayr lad kicked off his footballing career with a knock back from Grange Academy’s Performance School of Football.\u0026nbspShareByLochlin Highet12:00, 18 JUN 2018NewsAyr United\u0027s Finn Ecrepont (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMost success stories in football start with a rejection somewhere along the line. And 15-year-old Ayr United starlet Finn Ecrepont is no different. Dubbed a hot prospect with a bright future, the local Ayr lad kicked off his footballing career with a knock back from Grange Academy’s Performance School of Football. The Kilmarnock school has dedicated facilities for bright talents in the footballing world. And after leaving Alloway Primary, Ecrepont’s aim was to join the set-up at the Grange - but he was told he wasn’t good enough at his trial for the performance school. But the left-back, who also went to Glenburn Primary, refused to give up on his dream. Ecrepont, who has played with Ayr United since he was nine, said: “Getting that knock back is key to where I am today, because that has made me realise it’s not as easy as just walking into a team. “I didn’t get through the first trial so that made me focus and I knew I had to work hard. “I guess there was choices to make and sacrifices to make, but I was willing to make these changes for my football.  “I had training at Ayr the night after I got my knock back so I went to ask my coach Ross Armour for advice, so that’s when the work began. “I went away and worked on my game and a year later I got into the performance school at the Grange, which is one of the best things that has ever happened to me.” Ecrepont worked his way up through the ranks at Ayr and has now signed a three year deal with the first team. Just last season he was training with the under 17s, but his progress has been off the scale and he is now training with the senior side. He has been getting day release from school on a Thursday to train with the first team, but after signing his new deal he will train four mornings a week with Ian McCall’s side. And despite most schools refusing to take him in due to his football commitments, Ayr Academy were good enough to take him in. And dad Eddy, who runs Cafe Ginger in Ayr, claims teachers from Ayr Academy have offered to work overtime to help Ecrepont through his studies. Ecrepont is delighted to get his chance so early with Ayr.  He said: “The coaches thought I was playing well so I got more of a chance through my training and playing more with the under 20s last season. “I just love being in and around the first team, and the boys have been great with me so I am happy to be where I’m at at the moment. “Everyone at the club has been brilliant with me, through all the age groups. All the senior players and coaches have been really accepting of me and I couldn’t have asked for anything more. “Ian McCall and all of the other coaches are great because they always give me feedback. “Whether it’s positive or negative they are always keeping me right. That has been key to my progression. “If I was to ask anyone a question at Ayr they would answer it no problem, and that’s exactly what I look for and it’s why I’m here.” Despite the gruelling schedule of being a footballer, Ecrepont claims he is still fully focused on his school work.  He said: “Adapting to be a footballer hasn’t been much different as I enjoy it and it’s more like a hobby. I play football for fun and that’s what’s most important to me, so I guess it’s just normal. “It can take a lot out of me, but again because I enjoy football so much I don’t really realise how much I am doing. “I don’t think it’s had an effect on my school and I think it’s going good. Hopefully I have done well in my exams which I’ll find out in August. “I’ll get a Wednesday off from training so I can hopefully work towards getting my highers. “This year I’m studying higher English and PE, next year I’ll do something like Chemistry and Biology. And despite his age, Ecrepont has already been involved in a number of big games. He scored for Scotland under 16s against England, but for Ayr under 20s he was involved in a league decider last season against Morton. He said: “Unfortunately we lost the game 1-0 from a penalty, but I played the full game and it was a great experience and the boys played really well.  “There was quite a few Ayr United fans there so they gave us a great support.” But Ecrepont refuses to forget where he came from, he is sure to consistently help his dad Eddy in Cafe Ginger. Ecrepont said: “I signed for Ayr on the Tuesday, I was washing dishes for my dad on the Friday and on the Monday I was training with Scotland. “I work with my dad at the cafe which has been key to keeping me grounded. I know for a fact he wouldn’t let me get big-headed so I couldn’t thank him enough for that. “I’ve been asked before where I see myself in five years, but the honest answer is I don’t know. “For all I know I could get injured tomorrow and break my leg. “I have been told many times that I haven’t made it, and I know that. “My hard work starts now, so I just need to take everything as it comes and take each day on its own.” "},{"url":null,"title":"Glee as Melrose Primary choir raises the roof in Perth","story":"PERFORMING pupils from Melrose are officially amongst the best in Scotland.\nThe

Lowood Bridge has reopened ahead of schedule.\nThe B-listed 250 year old crossing, which links Galashiels and Melrose, was closed for 20 weeks between January 31 and June 15 for an essential and major repair and strengthening programme.\nDespite the early stages of the project taking place during the most extreme winter weather seen in recent years, the bridge reopened before the start of Melrose Festival Week.\nExtensive masonry repair works have taken place during this time which required significant scaffolding to be in place for a number of weeks, resurfacing of the road surface on and around the bridge has been carried out and the traffic light system upgraded.\nAll these works, which have been carried out by Borders contractors, also mean that Lowood Bridge\u0026rsquos 26 tonne weight limit has been removed, leaving all vehicles able to use the crossing.\nOver the first few days motorists are asked to drive carefully as they get used to travelling over the bridge once again.\nBus services which used the crossing before it closed will also return to using the B6374 road on Saturday, June 16.\nScottish Borders Council\u0026rsquos executive member for roads and

knew this closure would cause disruption locally over an extended period of time but the project team and the local contractors have worked very hard to ensure the project finished ahead of schedule

Royal Burgh Standard Bearer Peter Forrest.\nOn Friday morning the 26-year-old joiner led his town with both authority and calmness as Souters celebrated and honoured their historic traditions.\nYet the countdown couldn\u0027t have been more nerve-racking or distracting.\nDelays in Selkirk town centre renovations meant a reshuffle of vantage points for the iconic Casting of the Colours ceremony.\nAnd on the eve of the Common Riding itself, Storm Hector rampaged through the Royal Burgh tearing down bunting and leaving a trail of destruction and debris.\nIf the build-up wasn\u0027t distracting enough, a thoughtless thug spent the Nicht Afore the Morn spray-painting graffiti on landmarks including the War Memorial.\nBut just a few hours later the 2018 Standard Bearer remained the picture of calm as the sun gently rose on Friday morning.\nThe weather had relented, the debris had been cleared, the bunting had been restrung, and the vandalism was covered.\nAnd as Souters frae a\u0027 the airts linked arms and belted out the songs they\u0027d learned as children, all the woes were soon forgotten.\nSelkirk shone as it always does on Common Riding morning.\nAfter returning the Burgh Flag, Standard Bearer Forrest told us: \"I have been calm all week and even managed to get a good three hours\u0027 sleep last night.\n\"I\u0027m not sure how I manage it, but I don\u0027t get nervous at all, and despite everything that has happened, for me the Common Riding couldn\u0027t have gone any better.\n\"I\u0027ve loved the build up and I have loved every second of being Standard Bearer - I don\u0027t think the smile has left my face since the minute I got up this morning.\"\nWhether it was the four years he served as an Attendant - behind James Cheyne in 2009, Douglas Gunn in 2010, Gavin Henderson in 2012 and Kieran Riddle in 2017 - that equipped Peter for taking his duties in his stride, we\u0027ll never know.\nBut his composure and welcoming smile wasn\u0027t lost on any of the dignitaries around him.\nHonorary Provost Jake Wheelans said: \"After all the bad weather and everything else it was great to have Peter as our Standard Bearer.\n\"He was impeccable in every part of his duties today, and he upheld all of our traditions as a Standard Bearer should.\n\"Selkirk has enjoyed a tremendous Common Riding with a fantastic Standard Bearer.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"Keep calm - it  39 s only the Common Riding","story":"THE calming influence of Standard Bearer Peter Forrest made sure Selkirk Common Riding ran like clockwork on Friday.\nJust hours after Storm Hector had ripped through the region, Souters awoke to a serene and surprisingly relaxed morning.\nAnd about to head their day-long celebrations was to be the most relaxed of them all - Standard Bearer Forrest.\nThe Flute Band\u0027s Rouse Parade set the tone for a day few will forget.\nHundreds gathered at the War Memorial to honour the brave sons of Selkirk who didn\u0027t come home.\nAnd as the First Drum was sounded at 6am in the Market Place, the hundreds who do come home year after year from far off lands burst into song.\nHer Bright Smile has rarely sounded so good.\nThe build-up had well and truly begun.\nAnd by the time Standard Bearer Forrest was officially installed by Lady Busser, Dylis Wheelans, on the balcony of the Victoria Hall the hundreds had grown to thousands.\nA total of 281 riders followed the 2018 Standard Bearer doon the Green, across the Ettrick and up the Linglie.\nEveryone one of them was safe oot and every one of them returned safe in, some two-and-a-half hours later.\nOfficial reports later confirmed only three minor falls occurred throughout the entire procession.\nAs Standard Bearer Forrest, duly assisted by his Attendants Craig Monks, Robbie Reilly, Thomas Willmott and Liam Cassidy, led the cavalcade beyond Tibbie\u0027s towards the Three Brethren, beneath in the ancient streets of Selkirk the Hammermen, the Weavers, the Fleshers, the Colonials, the Merchants and the Ex-Soldiers began to muster ahead of their march to the Toll.\nAll the pomp and ceremony, headed by the trusty Silver and Pipe bands, brings out the best in this small rural burgh.\nIt\u0027s a place where pride and passion go hand in hand with smiles and laughter.\nSongs are sung, friendships rekindled and customs observed as the crowds patiently await the Coming in of the Burley.\nAnd they didn\u0027t have to wait long at Selkirk\u0027s northern most entrance as Standard Bearer Forrest, aboard the grey-dappled Lizzie, arrived to a cacophony of cheers and shouts of encouragement.\nProud parents, Ann and Rob, as well as girlfriend, Emma Pearce, were the first to offer him their congratulations as a well-deserved breather is taken at The Toll.\nAnd, in time-honoured fashion, his mounted followers made their own spectacular galloping return to the auld toon.\nJoyce Wright, representing the Ladies section of the Rig Committee, presented the traditional riding crop to Standard Bearer Forrest before he remounted to conclude his duties.\nAnd what a conclusion it is.\nThe Casting of the Colours pays homage to the heroic Fletcher, who returned from Flodden with a captured English banner and defiantly cast it around his head before dying.\nTo Up wi\u0027 the Souters Standard Bearer Forrest brought his ceremonial duties to an end with an impeccable cast.\nReflecting on his day, Peter told us: \"Being Standard Bearer was everything I knew it would be and more.\n\"I enjoyed the Marches - really enjoyed it - and my horse Lizzie was great.\n\"You think it can\u0027t get any better then it does. Coming in at The Toll was unbelievable and the Casting was something that will live with me forever.\n\"It has been a truly amazing day and I\u0027d like to thank everyone who came out and supported me.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"Casting their places in history","story":"SELKIRK Common Riding is undoubtedly a festival steeped in tradition and commemoration.\nBut it is also a day of contrasts for the followers as well as the ones lucky enough to take part.\nFrom the high-adrenaline riders returning at the Toll, the ecstasy and elation is quietly absorbed by reflection and respect as the colourful procession heads into town.\nBeneath silver skies the rearranged scarlet plinth within the Market Place awaited not only Royal Burgh Standard Bearer Peter Forrest, but the six accompanying Standard Bearers selected by the town\u0026rsquos ancient Societies and Associations.\nTo the growing thrum of expectation, as the hidden clock ticked past eleven, all seven gathered beneath the steps to await a brief minute or two that will live with them forever.\nSince the tragic cast of a blood-soaked English banner more than 500 years ago, this re-enactment both commemorates and celebrates, defiance and pride in equal measure.\nAnd as the Silver Band leads the way with Up wi\u0026rsquo the Souters, each Standard Bearer in turn re-enacts and relives this defiant and proud act.\nStandard Bearer Forrest, as he had been all morning, was assured and relaxed as he turned the Royal Burgh Standard above his head.\nIt was as deserved a cheer as any Standard Bearer has received as he smiled, waved and made his way from the gaze of five-thousand eyes.\nCollege lecturer Mark Easson \u0026ndash a painter by trade \u0026ndash resumed where Standard Bearer Forrest had left off. Armed with the Incorporation of Hammermen Banner, the 49-year-old showed a steady hand and perfect timing to provide an impeccable cast.\nHis smile was as deserved as the loud cheer that followed him down the steps.\nFletcher himself was a weaver before that bloody battle in 1513, and Michael Pepper made sure the fabric of the historic Corporation continued unblemished for another year.\nThe 27-year-old textiles worker may have looked a little nervous but as his cast continued his smile grew. Again, the appreciation was richly deserved.\nFormer farmer Jackie Johnston brought experience with him as he provided a perfect cast of the Incorporation of Fleshers Flag.\nIf there were nerves, they didn\u0026rsquot show as the self-employed excavator took it all in his stride, even managing a thumbs-up to the conductor of the Silver Band before dismounting.\nWhile the other Standard Bearers have enjoyed several weeks\u0026rsquo of practice under the guiding gaze of those who have gone before them, Colonial Standard Bearer Alisdair Piercy has been using two broom-handles taped together with an old Scotland flag in his garage in Toronto.\nBut casting the colours is in his blood - the 39-year-old was following in the footsteps of his father, Drew, and grandfather, Archie, by casting the colours.\nAnd the 2018 Colonial Standard Bearer was perfect in every way as he cast the striking yellow banner above his head.\nFollowing the ceremony Alisdair revealed: \u0026ldquoI watched the casting so many times when I was a boy growing up in Selkirk.\n\u0026ldquoBeing up there was amazing \u0026ndash I was ready to start but when that drum sounds it hits you right in the heart.\n\u0026ldquoI was trying not to listen to the band and keep counting in my head, like I\u0026rsquod been told, and I think it worked.\nThe wave and grin from Alisdair were deserved as he savoured every moment on the scarlet plinth.\nOne Standard Bearer who is more familiar with the new-look Market Place than most is architect Stuart Davidson.\nThe 37-year-old dad-of-three has been heavily involved in the ongoing redesign of the town centre.\nStuart was a picture of concentration throughout most of his faultless cast, only allowing himself a huge smile of relief during the final bars of Up wi\u0026rsquo the Souters.\nArguably the most poignant of all is saved for last.\nFormer KOSB Martin Young brought with him all the military discipline and reliability you would expect as he carried the Ex-Soldiers\u0026rsquo Association Flag onto the scarlet plinth.\nThe father of two, who is a now a traffic policeman, provided another faultless cast with the Union banner before leading this close-knit community in two minutes of silence and reflection.\nWith the centenary fast approaching of the end of the Great War, the sacrifice made by so many is being brought even clearer into focus.\nThat defiance of tyranny and pride in one\u0026rsquos own beliefs and customs, shown by Fletcher, has carried on in Souters down the centuries as decade after decade they have made the ultimate sacrifice.\nThose two minutes of impeccable silence and reflection were only broken by the haunting strains of The Liltin.\nAnd for yet another year, Souters can return home safe in the knowledge that the past won\u0026rsquot be forgotten and the future is one of hope.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"New route planned for tonight s Melrosian s rideout","story":"FOLLOWERS of Melrosian

InChorus subsequently performed with Dougie at the Amber Festival in Perth.\nThe trip to New York was hugely memorable with the choir singing on the Red Steps in Times Square, at the annual NYPD concert, at various September Concerts in the city, and, most poignantly, at the British Memorial Garden to the relatives of the British people who had died on 9/11.\nMoira Pearson, who is one of the founding members and choir manager from 2009 to 2012, told us: \" When the advert for a New Peebles Choir was placed in the Peeblesshire News in September 2008 no-one could have imagined just how important InChorus would become to so many people.\n\"It was a great privilege to be the choir manager for three years, during which time we travelled to New York to support and sing at commemorative events for the 10th Anniversary of 9/11.\n\"The fundraising effort to enable the journey was immense but made much easier by the unstinting support of the Peebles community.\"\nAlthough the 9/11 concert will remain a highlight of the InChorus story, the successes and landmark achievements continued after they came home.\nThe next year, 2012, saw the choir performing to another full house at the Festival Theatre, this time raising funds for other charities which is what InChorus likes to do.\nThe following year they embarked upon their \u0026lsquoChoirathon\u0026rsquo in aid of Comic Relief, when they sang from 9.30am to 9.30pm in the sleet, but raised \u0026pound3,500 in the process.\nIn 2013 they also had their first foray to the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in what was to be come a biennial venture, winning the covered sell-out laurels in 2013, 2015 and 2017.\nIn 2014 the choir decided to try its hand at competition winning themselves a \u0026lsquoChoir of the Day\u0026rsquo award at the Scottish auditions of Choir of the Year, proving that even a very large choir can be sufficiently disciplined in all the nuances of choral singing to make a good impression.\nOver the years InChorus members discovered they rather liked performing at music festivals and have sung at T in the Park, Meadows Festival, Fringe by the Sea at North Berwick, Big Burns Supper in Dumfries, Eden Festival, Lindisfarne, and last year on the main stage between Texas and the Manic Street Preachers, at the BBC Children in Need\u0026rsquos Carfest in front of an audience of 20,000 people.

Aly was responsible for the huge flash mob \u0026lsquoDancing in the Street\u0026rsquo event last year, involving the whole community.\nShe told us: \"Whilst singing is at the heart of everything that InChorus has achieved over the last 10 years, it\u0026rsquos never been only that.\n\"Through this organisation we have seen people\u0026rsquos friendships, confidence, skills, self-esteem and both emotional and physical health all flourish and grow over the years.\n\"In return the members give their time freely and generously to learn, rehearse and perform music for the benefit of others.\n\"In its time InChorus has achieved and given so much more than any of us really ever anticipated at the outset and I think every member feels so proud about that.\nIt\u0026rsquos amazing what a community can achieve when they group together, take a collective breath and burst into song.\"\nThey say that into every life a little rain must fall, and InChorus has not escaped, losing three much loved ladies to cancer.\nIn 2016 it was founder members Kitty Lyle and Celia Hayton and, just a few weeks ago, Bernice Brown - all are missed greatly.\nThroughout its 10 years the choir has raised over \u0026pound60,000 for other charities, both through its own concerts and through specific charity events.\nThis is something that is at the core of InChorus, something of which they are proud, and something which will continue in the years to come.\nAt one charity dinner they even put up an InChorus performance as an auction prize and were \u0026lsquosold\u0026rsquo for over \u0026pound1100. This, in turn, led to a performance at a very prestigious charity dinner in aid of breast cancer.\nTo celebrate its 10th birthday, the choir will be travelling to Barcelona in October for a long weekend of performances.\nBut before that they have a bit of a party planned in Peebles.\nOn September 1, the actual birthday weekend, they have organised their \u0026lsquoTen out of Ten\u0026rsquo day - when they will sing throughout the day from a list of at least ten different favourite songs, at ten different locations in Peebles.\nAlthough the earlier locations have yet to be revealed the finale will take place at the Eastgate Theatre, where it all started ten years ago, for an evening concert.\nThis will also be the final event of the 2018 Creative Peebles Festival.\nThe choir hopes you will join them or, at least, come and say hello.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"United front to boost the Borderlands","story":"HUNDREDS of stakeholders had their say on proposals to transform the Borderlands economy at a special conference in Dumfries on Monday.\nLeader of Dumfries and Galloway Council, Elaine Murray, welcomed more than 370 business representatives, public sector organisations and individuals to the first Borderlands conference.\nShe said: \u0026ldquoI am delighted that so many people attended on the day, this shows what an important project the Borderlands Inclusive Growth Deal is.\n\"One attendee described the conference as an \u0026lsquoIlluminating and fantastic event\u0026rsquo, which reflected the enthusiasm I perceived on the day, that this is a once in a generation opportunity which must be seized.\nFive local authorities from north and south of the border are working in partnership to put together a proposal that should have huge implications for those who live, work and visit the area.\nIt was the first opportunity for interested parties to hear about the themes that are being developed to underpin the Borderlands Inclusive Growth Deal \u0026ndash and to give their views on the major projects they believe would kickstart transformation.\nThe conference was held at a key time for the partnership, made up of Carlisle City, Cumbria County, Dumfries and Galloway, Northumberland County and Scottish Borders Councils.\nResponses from the conference will help the partnership to build a case to present to both the UK and Scottish Governments later this year. Views were sought on the Borderlands\u0026rsquo key themes: Digital Energy Destination Borderlands Rural Productivity Business Growth Transport Innovation and Skills and Quality of Place.\nThe conference had backing from both governments who have pledged support for a deal.\nKeith Brown MSP, Cabinet Secretary for Economy, Jobs and Fair Work, said: \u0026ldquoThe Scottish Government has made clear our support for a proposed Borderlands deal in our budget statements. And we look forward to negotiating the detail of that deal when the partners are ready with their proposals. This is a key part of our commitment to 100 percent coverage of deals across Scotland.\n\u0026ldquoWe want to see an ambitious deal that focuses on driving inclusive growth and the priorities that will make a difference and help the economy thrive. We want a deal that helps address the area\u0026rsquos connectivity challenges, supports growth in sectors particularly important in the Borderlands, and creates more opportunities for all to attract people to the area.\n\u0026ldquoWe are working to tackle the economic challenges in the South of Scotland, having already committed to establishing a South of Scotland enterprise agency, and we want to ensure that priorities align to maximise impact and success.\nSpeaking ahead of the conference the Secretary of State for Scotland, David Mundell said:\n\"The Borderlands Growth Deal represents a unique opportunity to provide a real shot in the arm to the economy of our region, a region that faces similar challenges wherever you live or work within it.\n\u0026ldquoWorking with the proposals that have been prepared by local authorities, businesses and individuals, we will spend the summer shaping these in to a coherent deal that will support the economy of the region by encouraging people to invest in new opportunities, by building on our strengths and improving the lives of those who live here.\n\u0026ldquoIn that way, we will bring to the Borderlands the benefits that are now being seen across the UK as investment in City and Growth Deals progresses.\nDumfries and Galloway Council Chief Executive Gavin Stevenson said: \u0026ldquoCrucially we now sit between the emerging powerhouses of the central belt of Scotland and the Northern Powerhouse in England. Unless we act they will continue to suck up our young talent and skills.\n\u0026ldquoWe need to re-position ourselves, we need to stabilise and to stop our productivity falling and then we also need to reinvent. This feels like a once in a generation opportunity.\n\u0026ldquoWe know our potential, our children will not forgive us if there are no jobs in the future. I think we are at that point where we either put up or shut up. We get out there, we shout, we demand and we create the business opportunities.\nThose attending quizzed a panel, chaired by the UK Government\u0026rsquos Borderlands champion John Stevenson MP, on how the deal could support inclusivity, tourism projects and benefit small rural communities.\nFor more information visit the partnership website www.Borderlandsgrowth or email info@borderlandsgrowth\n"},{"url":null,"title":"Youngsters make a splash at Braw Lads  39  Swimming Gala","story":"SPECTATORS crammed into Galashiels Swimming Pool on Tuesday night for the Braw Lads\u0027 Swimming Gala.\nBraw Lad Greg Kelly, Braw Lass Kimberley O\u0027May and their attendants were given a rousing welcome as they came to support the young competitors.\nAnd the swimmers from all age groups put on a fantastic display throughout the evening, which culminated with the mixed aged group Braw Lads\u0027 Relay Race.\nThis event didn\u0027t disappoint.

Six-year-old Maisie, who plays the main character, Libby, in the film, in what was her first ever acting role, was accompanied to the glitzy ceremony in Los Angeles by her mother Elizabeth, co-star and writer Rachel Shenton, and the short film\u0026rsquos director Chris Overton.  And while a little young to be enjoying a champagne celebration, Maisie will be returning to her Upper Stratton home as one of the youngest actors to have starred in an Oscar-winning film.      THE.

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.  Maisie then flew with her proud parents, Elizabeth, who is also deaf,\u0026nbspand Gilson, who is partially deaf, to the film\u0026rsquos international premiere in Rhode Island \u0026ndash her first visit to the US, and her first time on a plane.  The film was given its first public screening in Swindon last month at the Swindon Arts Centre. Gilson, who spoke before and after the showing, said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a great pleasure to be able to finally show this in Swindon.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a film to be appreciated, and to spread a message.

The court was presented with details of the alleged anti-social behaviour of Mr Conner, including shouting, swearing and fighting within a property at Links Avenue, and disposing of items and bags of rubbish outwith a domestic bin within the communal garden.

Len Smith, 92, was conscripted at the age of 18 and was a supply lorry driver for the British Liberation Army.  He landed at Gold Beach, Normandy, where he said he was not shot at and saw little combat.  But he drove some of the first troops into Berlin in 1945 and moved supplies through a war-ravaged France, Belgium, Holland and Germany.  Despite his actions, modest Len, who went on to work in the civil service, said he had never thought of himself as veteran, never mind a hero.  He told the Courier: \u0026ldquoThere were thousands of young men like me. I never considered myself a veteran until the recent events marking the anniversary led to me looking back.  \u0026ldquoAt the time we just got on with it the real heroes are the soldiers who fought and died over there.  Mr Smith was one of eight children born in Pencaitland to local couple John and Euphemia Smith.  His sister Ellen, 97, still lives in Pencaitland and he visits the area regularly but after he was demobbed in 1947, Mr Smith moved to Longlevens, Gloucestershire, to find work.  Now a widower, Mr Smith\u0026rsquos sister sends him the Courier every week so he can keep up with local news.  His L\u0026eacutegion d\u0026rsquoHonneur medal was sent to his home in Cheltenham by post and contained a letter from Jean-Pierre Jouyet, French ambassador to the UK, which said: \u0026ldquoI offer you my warmest congratulations on this high honour, which recognises your military engagement and steadfast involvement in the liberation of France during the Second World War.  \u0026ldquoAs we contemplate this Europe of peace, we must never forget the heroes like you who came from Britain and the Commonwealth to begin the liberation of Europe by liberating France.  But Mr Smith insists he was just a young man doing a job.  He said: \u0026ldquoI didn\u0026rsquot know how the war was going, I didn\u0026rsquot read anything about the war. I was a young lad and I had no fear.  \u0026ldquoI just thought \u0026lsquoget on with it\u0026rsquo.  However, he remembers thinking about how worried his mother would be.  Len\u0026rsquos brothers James and Thomas were also in active service and James was in the D-Day landings. All three came home.  He said: \u0026ldquoWhen we came back my mum was overjoyed, she got three sons back uninjured.  Last year, Mr Smith returned to the Normandy beaches on a British Legion tour organised for veterans. He said: \u0026ldquoI wasn\u0026rsquot involved in the D-Day landings the people that were are the heroes."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7252400.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"  39 Important progress  39  at Knox Academy  say inspectors","story":"              A SECONDARY school which came under fire from Government inspectors last year has made \u0026ldquosome important progress.  Education Scotland visited Knox Academy in Haddington at the end of 2016 and told parents that the school needed to \u0026ldquorevisit its \u0026ldquovision and values.  The inspection report, which was released in March last year, highlighted a number of areas in which the school could improve. \u0026lsquoLeadership of change\u0026rsquo and \u0026lsquolearning, teaching and assessment\u0026rsquo were ranked as \u0026lsquosatisfactory\u0026rsquo, while \u0026lsquoensuring wellbeing, equality and inclusion\u0026rsquo was described as \u0026lsquoweak\u0026rsquo.  Inspectors returned to the school 12 months on from the original report for a follow-up inspection, which led to a new report being published on Tuesday.  The inspection team talked to young people at the school and worked closely with the interim headteacher Lauren Rodger, who is returning to North Berwick High School after the summer holidays.  She will be replaced by Susan Cook, currently acting headteacher at Trinity Academy, Edinburgh  Other members of staff were also spoken to, to hear about the steps the school had taken to improve on areas previously identified in the original inspection.  Education Scotland noted the following key improvements:  - The interim headteacher has provided effective leadership in taking forward work to secure improvements, including a review of the school values  - Staff have developed a range of policies to improve practice in equalities and inclusion, including a new safeguarding policy  - The recently created Pupil Support Faculty is now better placed to address the needs of young people, and those with social, emotional and behavioural needs in particular  - The school has made progress in establishing a more positive learning environment for all.  The report did note that there were still some improvements to be made.  Issues highlighted included using evidence from self-evaluation activities to ensure consistency in learning and teaching across the school reviewing the purpose of the pupil support base to ensure there was a greater focus on learning for the young people using it and ensuring there was a whole school approach to equalities and inclusion.  Fiona Robertson, head of education at East Lothian Council, praised staff at the school for their efforts.  She said: \u0026ldquoI am pleased that Education Scotland acknowledges that Knox Academy has made important progress since the last inspection, and I would like to thank all the staff and pupils for their hard work and commitment in making these improvements.  \u0026ldquoIt is really encouraging that the positive relationships between pupils and teachers, and the fact that almost all young people recognise the value of learning in their lives, was noted.  \u0026ldquoThis is a strong basis for ensuring that the school continues to be a positive learning environment for staff and pupils alike.  And she added: \u0026ldquoWe will continue to work with the school and Education Scotland to make further improvements, and to working with Susan Cook, our new headteacher, who joins the school in August.  Education Scotland will continue to work with East Lothian Council regarding the school\u0026rsquos capacity to improve and will return to carry out another inspection within 18 months."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7898185.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Thousands oppose Dunbar town centre parking charge plans","story":"              MORE than 2,000 people have signed a petition against the idea of parking charges being introduced on Dunbar High Street.  A public consultation looking at potential parking solutions throughout East Lothian came to a close last month.  Meetings and workshops were held throughout the county by East Lothian Council, including one in Dunbar Royal British Legion.  A number of suggestions were put forward, including for a disc parking system where visitors to the busy street would set a disc showing when they had parked.  Another idea being explored is parking charges \u0026ndash but that has met with the opposition of Dunbar Trades\u0026rsquo Association (DTA).  Philip Mellor, DTA chairman, said that the group \u0026ldquostrongly oppose the introduction of parking charges.  A petition, which was put in various businesses in the town, has attracted more than 2,000 signatures.  Mr Mellor added: \u0026ldquoThe DTA feel introducing parking charges to High Street and other key off-street parking areas will have a detrimental effect on our High Street and the local economy.  \u0026ldquoThe current system since the introduction of traffic wardens has already addressed concerns around space for shoppers on High Street and it now seems counterintuitive to then introduce a measure which will drive more customers away to out-of-town developments.  \u0026ldquoWhilst parking during heavy summer visitor times can be difficult, it is very few special event days where parking is congested enough to even consider parking charges viable the majority of the time parking is available and this potential charge seems to be nothing more than a money-raising exercise at the expense yet again of already-struggling independent business owners.  A spokesman for East Lothian Council said \u0026ldquoall responses would be taken into consideration as it looked to develop a strategy.  He added: \u0026ldquoThe draft Local Transport Strategy (LTS) sets out ways in which the council can meet both national and local objectives sustainably, while supporting the local economy and environment.  \u0026ldquoOur consultation on the draft LTS recently closed and we are grateful to everyone who responded or attended one of our workshops.

East Lothian Council intends to create a new primary school, operating from the existing school buildings, which will cover nursery through to primary seven. The proposal was approved by East Lothian Council in April after a public consultation. It has now also been approved by the Scottish Government.

Five retail units are planned for a site at Gateside previously earmarked for a Sainsbury\u0026rsquos supermarket and petrol station.  The site, which totals about 60,000 sq ft, could be made up of units ranging from 7,500 sq ft to 20,000 sq ft in size.  Alastair Dickie, development director with Ediston Real Estates, which now owns the site, attended the town\u0026rsquos community council meeting on Tuesday, one week before plans are unveiled to the public.  He told members the proposal was for the site to include three food retailers, with the other two units including \u0026ldquoa household-type retail business and a coffee drive-through facility.  However, he was keeping tight-lipped on the identity of the businesses until legal agreements were in place.  Mr Dickie hoped planning permission for the site, off Oak Tree Roundabout west of Haddington, could be achieved by the end of the year.  He said: \u0026ldquoIf we submit an application in August, we would hope. . . we would hopefully have a consent in December or January next year.  \u0026ldquoWe could be on site quarter one of 2019.  It is then hoped that the retailers could be trading in the lead-up to Christmas that year or early in 2020.  The development, which has been described as \u0026ldquoEast Lothian\u0026rsquos first retail park, will involve in the region of \u0026pound14 million investment, with 150 jobs potentially created, as well as those during the construction process.  It has already been revealed that talks are ongoing with \u0026ldquoa number of major retailers who will be new to East Lothian.  Concerns have been expressed by a number of retailers in the town centre that the creation of a retail park on the outskirts would be detrimental to their business.

The new scheme offers people an opportunity to support Our Community Energy \u0026ndash a partnership between not-for-profit Scottish firm Our Power and Mongoose Energy, which manages community energy assets \u0026ndash and hopes to find investors in the county.  They say that the site at Pogbie Windfarm \u0026ndash already home to the turbines \u0026ndash will create enough energy to power 7,200 homes and believe that, when they combine it with a second site in Berwickshire, the scheme will raise an estimated \u0026pound1.9 million in surplus profit over 25 years.  Our Power said that profit from the wind turbines it takes over would then be used to keep energy prices down, helping people who are struggling with the costs.  They need to raise just over \u0026pound3 million for the project, which covers both sites, and community groups and individuals are being invited to invest in bonds and shares to raise the money needed to get the project up and running, with investments ranging from \u0026pound500 to \u0026pound100,000.  Andrew Smith, Our Community Energy acting chairperson, said: \u0026ldquoFuel poverty is a huge issue for Scotland and we\u0026rsquore proud to be launching such an important fundraising opportunity to directly tackle it.  \u0026ldquoInvesting with a social purpose is something close to the hearts of many Scots, and these bond and equity offers provide the chance to have a huge impact locally.  \u0026ldquoThese offers aim to support those who struggle to afford sufficiently heated homes, as well as providing investors with an exciting new option which not only targets a significant social impact but a positive environmental one too.  \u0026ldquoHowever with these types of investments there are some risks and funds are not readily realisable.  \u0026ldquoInvestors should note that capital is at risk and returns are not guaranteed.  A fuel poor household is defined as one which needs to spend more than 10 per cent of its income on all fuel use and to heat its home to an adequate standard of warmth.  Last year, the East Lothian Poverty Commission found that almost half of local pensioners were forced to spend more than 10 per cent of their income on energy bills.  Mark Kenber, CEO of Mongoose Energy, added: \u0026ldquoWith the majority of Scots recognising the critical level that fuel poverty has reached, it is now more important than ever for investors to put their money into causes that work for the social good, not just their own.  \u0026ldquoOur Community Energy not only gives investors the potential to earn competitive interest rates on their money, but also the opportunity to support the wider Scottish community.

A pressure group called \u0026lsquoBowls for Gullane\u0026rsquo was established on Facebook in the wake of concerns that the village\u0026rsquos bowling club \u0026ndash with a membership of only about 30 \u0026ndash was to be sold to developers.  Councillor Jeremy Findlay, ward member and former chairman of Gullane Area Community Council, said: \u0026ldquoAll three ward councillors are behind the campaign to save the club and we hope that the members understand the feeling in the village.  \u0026ldquoI understand that the committee own the club and it would be the members who benefit from any potential sale.  About 50 residents gathered outside the bowling club on Monday evening to show their displeasure at the possible loss of the club.  The group told the Courier they had had hundreds of offers of support.  Catherine MacKenzie said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove had people phone up, email and text us \u0026ndash and face-to-face \u0026ndash to tell us that they\u0026rsquore willing to become a member.  \u0026ldquoSome of them don\u0026rsquot live locally, or won\u0026rsquot be able to bowl, but they are willing to pay the membership fees. People do not want to see the club close.  Gordon McLelland, a local resident and member of the community council, added: \u0026ldquoThe community council want to save the club for the community.  \u0026ldquoWe have tried hard to offer the club our support to work with them but so far they have turned that down.  Billy Mellors, the county\u0026rsquos bowls development officer, said: \u0026ldquoThe overwhelming support from the local community indicates to me the future of Gullane Bowling Club can be sustained if the current members accept it.  Many locals have tried to sign up as members but have been turned away by the club, it has been claimed.  Another member of the group said: \u0026ldquoWhat has shocked us as a group is how many people have been refused membership in recent years \u0026ndash young and old have come forward with their personal experience of being turned away.  Mr Mellors added: \u0026ldquoTime will tell on the way the club want to go but we all hope a common sense approach is taken to preserve this community facility.  East Lothian MSP Iain Gray met representatives of the Bowls for Gullane group last week and is keen to find a solution to ensure the club\u0026rsquos survival.  He said: \u0026ldquoThis is an unfortunate situation Gullane has lost too many local assets recently, so every effort should be made to avoid losing another. I did meet with representatives of the campaign and have said that I will support them in trying to find a way the land, and preferably bowling too, can remain part of the village community.  Ian McMillan, CEO of Bowls Scotland, said that he was \u0026ldquodelighted to see local residents lend their support to the campaign to save the 116-year-old club.  He added: \u0026ldquoI would encourage all in the village to support their historic club, get on the green, enjoy the great game of bowls and ensure future generations can benefit from the opportunity to play an accessible, inclusive sport. Bowls Scotland fully supports the work being undertaken to keep bowls an important part of Gullane\u0026rsquos community fabric.  Les Ritchie, secretary of East Lothian Bowling Association, told the group: \u0026ldquoWe are ready to support you and the community in whatever steps might secure a future for bowling in Gullane.  Attempts by the Courier to speak to Michael Baxter, vice-president and secretary at the bowling club, were unsuccessful this week. In April, Mr Baxter told us: \u0026ldquoThere are not enough members to support the running of the club.  He had said then that the club was \u0026ldquotrying to find a solution but that it was not viable to continue with a dwindling membership.  A spokeswoman for East Lothian Council confirmed the land was earmarked for leisure and recreation use in the Local Development Plan and any deviation from that would require planning permission for a potential change of use."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7297144.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Haddington hosts world record attempt for the Slosh dance","story":"              HUNDREDS of people are set to lace up their dancing shoes in a bid to break a world record.

The group, who meet in North Berwick\u0027s St Andrew Blackadder Church every Friday, will be performing Evan Placey\u0026rsquos powerful play Girls Like That, which explores the consequences of a naked photo being sent round a school and how this affects, not only the girl in the photo, but the way in which girls react and respond.  Indelible Arts director Linda Grant told the Courier: \"I am so delighted that our talented cast have made it to the SCDA one act festival.  \"It really is a joy to bring all these young people together who have a love of the performing arts and support each other in a very nurturing environment.

S6 pupil Ella Higgins said: \"When I first read the script, I immediately loved it and was desperate to perform it.  \"I\u0026rsquove never read or seen anything that fully demonstrates how much resilience is needed to survive in high school as a teenage girl to the extent that this play does and it covers so many issues and scenarios that many girls do experience in real life.  \"This play is such an important and well written piece. I feel so proud to be performing it at the final and I hope we do it justice and get it the recognition it deserves.\"  Holly Edwards, another S6 pupil, said: \"The play is extremely relevant and gives a taste of real life and what really goes on at schools that have such a large social media influence.  \"The competition means a lot to us as a group and the thought of getting to the final is so exciting, we want to show people what this play is all about.

Colin Beattie stressed that \u0026ldquoradical thinking needed to be done to create a solution, highlighting a possible extension of a tram or light rail system out to Musselburgh.  During a recent Holyrood debate, he said: \u0026ldquoPeople meet the queues of traffic heading on to the bypass on the main roads around my constituency before they are even near the bypass. This causes more congestion and more air pollution.  Mr Beattie later said: \u0026ldquoYou can go along the road at any time of the day and there are queues of traffic, mainly at Sheriffhall Roundabout.  \u0026ldquoIt is important that when the Government are looking at all the possible changes required to the bypass, all options are considered. The main priority should be that it is cost-efficient and done as soon as possible.  \u0026ldquoIt may be that it is more economic to extend a tram or light rail system out to the main population centres such as Musselburgh than to take on the eye-watering cost of enlarging the A720. This would also benefit the environment and be much faster than using road transport.  \u0026ldquoClearly more radical thinking needs to be done on creating a sustainable solution. I am not convinced that simply replicating a system which moves traffic speedily and efficiently into new choke points is the answer.  Miles Briggs, Lothian region MSP who led the Parliamentary debate, said: \u0026ldquoThe transport information company Inrix in late 2016 identified the bypass as the most congested trunk road outside London, with four of the UK\u0026rsquos worst bottlenecks.  \u0026ldquoI continue to be contacted by frustrated constituents and businesspeople who face frequent delays when using the bypass to commute or transport goods, especially but not exclusively at peak times or when there is an accident on the route. Many drivers tell me their experience is that these tailbacks and traffic jams are becoming more and more regular.  He said that while proposed work at Sheriffhall would be an important improvement, he added: \u0026ldquoIt is only one part of what needs to be a far broader, long-term and coordinated programme of improvements to the bypass which will ensure traffic can keep moving in the decades ahead.  \u0026ldquoThis means looking at innovative solutions, assessing whether extra lanes will be needed, looking at the possible use of hard shoulders in some situations and utilising technology so the bypass can become a smart motorway.  Mr Briggs called on the Scottish Government to take forward a feasibility study into widening the city bypass and new options to address the growing congestion.  A Transport Scotland spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe Edinburgh and South East Scotland City Region Deal includes investment of up to \u0026pound120m in the A720 city bypass for the grade separation of Sheriffhall Roundabout and \u0026pound20 million investment in public transport infrastructure in west Edinburgh.  \u0026ldquoThis investment will improve journey reliability and safety for all users and support significant planned investment in Edinburgh and South East Scotland.  \u0026ldquoThe Scottish Government remains committed to undertaking the improvements at the Sheriffhall junction at the earliest opportunity. We are continuing to progress the detailed design development and assessment of the preferred option and expect to publish draft orders in 2019."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7930076.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Haddington pub seeking new owners","story":"              A TOWN centre pub which changed its name less than a year ago is on the lookout for new people to run it.

Brave Ruth Quilietti-Bird \u0026ndash who at one point was the most ill person \u0026ldquoin the whole of the UK, according to her husband \u0026ndash moved hospital several times to receive specialist treatment for multiple organ failure, spending her 40th birthday in intensive care rather than on a planned holiday.  She has had both her feet amputated after they suffered tissue damage due to sepsis \u0026ndash a serious complication of an infection.\u0026nbsp It was also feared that Ruth, who taught art at Knox Academy in Haddington and Preston Lodge High School, Prestonpans, might also lose her hands.  She is recovering at the Astley Ainslie Hospital in Edinburgh, where she is getting used to her newly-fitted prosthetic legs with the aid of physiotherapists.  The health of her hands improved and she is keeping them busy by resuming her love of creative activities such as drawing, weaving and needlework.  Ruth is now looking forward to getting out of hospital to rejoin her family: husband Mark, 47, and their daughters, seven-year-old Lucia and Isabella, five.    But she can\u0026rsquot return to her New Street home in Musselburgh as it has an outdoor staircase and is no longer suitable, so the search for a new home is under way.  Now her friend Jacqueline Campbell has launched a crowdfunding campaign to raise \u0026pound20,000 to help fund a mobility scooter and adapt a new property.  In March, Ruth suddenly started to have breathing problems along with vomiting and diarrhoea.  Mark, a nurse at the Western General Hospital in Edinburgh, said she was rushed to the accident and emergency unit at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh by paramedics who assessed that she was suffering from sepsis, which can be triggered by an infection and affected her immune system.  He said: \u0026ldquoHer health deteriorated more and more and she was taken to the high dependency unit. They said they needed to ventilate Ruth and that was the last time I spoke to her for two-and-a-half weeks. She went into a medicalised coma.  Mark said it was still unknown what was causing the infection, so Ruth received multiple antibiotics.  \u0026ldquoThe consultant told me to prepare myself because we were losing Ruth, he said.  The medical team decided to take Ruth into theatre to connect an ECMO (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) circuit to help her breathing.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoThey managed to stabilise her but her vital organs were failing. Her respiratory had already failed and her kidneys had failed.  \u0026ldquoThere was no one as ill as Ruth in the whole of the UK at that time, receiving that amount of support to keep her alive.  Ruth was then transferred to a specialist ECMO unit at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoHer liver was failing and her heart was beginning to fail.  \u0026ldquoThey said again that they were losing Ruth and she wouldn\u0026rsquot last the in-patient stay.  \u0026ldquoThey made the decision to fit a second ECMO circuit to support her heart and this stabilised her.  \u0026ldquoI was told several times I might be potentially losing Ruth. Then things started improving and they were able to withdraw some of the support and her blood tests were showing very small improvements.  \u0026ldquoRuth was infected with group \u0026lsquoA\u0026rsquo streptococcal, a very aggressive bacteria which is around us all the time.  \u0026ldquoRuth\u0026rsquos immune system was already affected, so it was able to take over very quickly, causing failure to the vital organs. She was diagnosed with sepsis and pneumonia.  Ruth began to make progress with her breathing, her heart started to stabilise and her kidneys started to improve. Doctors felt they could remove the ECMO circuit for the heart and rescind the \u0026lsquodo not resuscitate\u0026rsquo notice.  As doctors brought Ruth out of sedation, she faced the risk of haemorrhaging throughout the body because of blood thinning and medications.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoI remember her opening her eyes and looking at me.  \u0026ldquoWe put our foreheads together and looked into each others\u0026rsquo eyes. I knew that Ruth was back.  \u0026ldquoHow close she was to dying on several occasions is still difficult to comprehend.  A special moment for Ruth was a visit by her daughters for her birthday when they took her cuddly toys and held her hand. Her mum and dad were also at her bedside.  Ruth was moved back to the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, where her ventilator was removed and she was able to start to speak.  But as she got better, she was to face a huge decision as a result of the tissue damage, caused by the lack of blood flow, which had turned her feet black.  She was told she would have to lose her right foot and possibly half of her left foot, with surgery carried out at St John\u0026rsquos Hospital in Livingston.  But Ruth, determined to get the best quality of life, made the decision to lose both feet below the knee, which would give her more choices in terms of prosthetics and improve her recovery.    Mark paid tribute to the \u0026ldquowonderful hospital staff who had \u0026ldquogiven everything for Ruth.  He highlighted the help he had received from friends and family over the past few months, including the network of \u0026lsquoSupermums\u0026rsquo who looked after Lucia and Isabella, friends, neighbours and colleagues at the Western General.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe kindness of people has been overwhelming. They want to help so much.

The report, backed by councillors, said the feasibility study would aim to lead to the creation of \u0026ldquoa common secondary school day and a common curricular structure.  The move would also see a change in hours for primary schools to match the new secondary day, with proposals to extend P1 and P2 pupils\u0026rsquo week from 22.5 hours to the same 25 hours that their older school-mates follow. A failure to synchronise primary school start and finish times to match the high school changes would cost the council an estimated \u0026pound190,000 in additional transport costs.  A public consultation will now be launched with the schools to establish the best standard timetable, with options for a 27, 32 or 33-period week. A 33-period week, for instance, could see secondary students\u0026rsquo first period of the day start at 8.30am, with a finish time of 3.40pm Monday to Thursday and 12.55pm on Fridays.  The council said a common school day would lead to joint delivery, mutual support, sharing of best practice and collaborative professional development opportunities, as well as meaning greater equity of resource and opportunity for young people across East Lothian and barriers to travel would be reduced.  Councillor Shamin Akhtar, cabinet spokesperson for education, said: \u0026ldquoThese proposals are all about improving inclusion, wellbeing and equality. We\u0026rsquore always keen to look for new ways of raising attainment and improving positive destinations for our children and young people.  \u0026ldquoThere are a number of potential practical benefits associated with such changes. It\u0026rsquos important that we listen to the views of staff, pupils, parents, carers and other stakeholders. That\u0026rsquos why I\u0026rsquom pleased cabinet has agreed that the council will hold a consultation and carry out a feasibility study. This will be launched in due course.  Current school times: Dunbar Grammar School starts at 8.40am with a home time of 3.50pm Monday to Thursday and 12.30pm on Fridays Preston Lodge High School starts at 8.40am and finishes at 3.40pm Monday to Thursday and 12.25pm on Fridays Knox Academy is 8.44am to 4pm Monday to Thursday, finishing at 12.05pm on Fridays Musselburgh Grammar School starts at 8.45am, finishing at 3.50pm and 12.30pm on Fridays North Berwick High School starts at 8.39am and finishes at 3.50pm \u0026ndash noon on Fridays Ross High School starts at 8.30am, finishing at 3.35pm \u0026ndash 11.55am on Fridays."},{"url":null,"title":"Ormiston Park formally opens after years of refurbishment work","story":"              SUPPORTERS of Ormiston Park celebrated its official opening on Saturday following four years of hard work.

The alcohol side of the business was discussed at a recent meeting of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos licensing board in Haddington.  An increase in the display of alcohol of 8.8 square metres was proposed and given the green light by the committee\u0026rsquos councillors.  A detailed statement was provided to the committee which outlined the revamp both inside and outside the shop.  It read: \u0026ldquoThe result will be a modern, bright, accessible and customer-friendly store with a focus on quality.

Colin Beattie\u0027s comments follows a \"positive meeting\" with health bosses in the wake of patients\u0027 concerns about the service at the enlarged practice in the Musselburgh Primary Care Centre.  The Musselburgh MSP met with doctors and staff at the surgery, along with representatives from East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership.  Mr Beattie said: \"There is no doubt that there are issues around patients\u0026rsquo communication with the surgery, particularly at peak times. I was pleased that the surgery has recognised this and was in a position to give me a briefing on the situation.\"  He said doctors were now up to their full staffing level of 14 and an additional four staff members to take phone calls were in the process of being recruited.  During the visit, Mr Beattie had the chance to discuss other new initiatives which were \"positively transforming the surgery\".  He said: \"While much work seems to have been done, more still has to be achieved to improve the service to patients.  \"I am confident that Riverside and East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership are seriously addressing their remaining issues and I will be keeping in close contact going forward to ensure that my constituents receive the service they should expect.\"  He added that the practice was looking at introducing an online appointment booking system, which it is anticipated would reduce phone calls to the practice.  Riverside was also looking at different options as to how to more effectively manage phone calls at the volume it was receiving, he said.  Mr Beattie said: \"I have encouraged the practice to expedite the introduction of the online appointment booking system, which I feel will have the greatest and quickest effect on the experience of patients contacting the surgery.\"  He also raised the concerns of patients who might have to speak to multiple staff over a period before they were dealt with.  \"Clearly a single point of contact who can immediately direct the patient to the correct destination would be cheaper for the surgery and more efficient and less frustrating for the patient,\" added Mr Beattie."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7958191.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"New Zealand leader recovers with mac-n-cheese after birth","story":"              New Zealand\u0026rsquos Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern is regaining her strength with macaroni and cheese and plans to spend at least one more night in an Auckland public hospital with her newborn girl.

Speaking to media from the town of Nelson, Ardern\u0026rsquos parents Ross and Laurell Ardern said the baby had been very active during the night and had kept their daughter awake. Laurell Ardern said she had been poring over photos.  \u0026ldquoThe baby was looking up at Jacinda and it looked like she was in awe of her and I couldn\u0026rsquot get over how alert it was just after being born, she said.  \u0026ldquoSo, I\u0026rsquom dying to see it and hold her and just see what\u0026rsquos she\u0026rsquos like.

The findings are based on experiments carried out using air pollution monitors in various UK locations - including Busby in East Renfrewshire and East Kilbride in South Lanarkshire - to coincide with Clean Air Day. The other sites were Manchester, Leeds and London.  It was led by environmental charity, Global Action Plan.

The tests were conducted using air pollution monitors, called micro-Athelometers, attached to the back packs of children or carried at shoulder height by adults.  On average, the experiments found that children walking to school on a busy route were exposed to 2.5 times more pollution from petrol and diesel exhaust fumes than pupils on a quiet route, while youngsters were breathing in 30 per cent more particulates and nitrogen oxide fumes than the adults.

Now the sinister sight of cherry trees draped in eerie cobwebs is taking hold in Scotland after the beast from the east Siberian storm and recent heatwave created perfect conditions for the phenomenom.  Huge numbers of bird cherry ermine moth caterpillars has created the spectre in woodlands across the country as they spin elaborate webs to protect them from predators.  They feed on bird cherry trees which are found across Europe and when they emerge fully grown, they become distinctive white moths with five rows of black dots.  The larvae, which are about an inch long, make large communal silvery webs for protection and then feast on the surrounding leaves, stripping the trees bare.  There are eight species of ermine moths in this country and 2,400 species of moths in the British Isles and they usually pupate into adult moths in July or August.  The Woodland Trust Scotland has been receiving many reports of the ghostly looking trees in recent days with worried callers expressing alarm at the trees being stripped of all vegetation.  But the trees are not killed and will recover next year, by which time the caterpillars will have found somewhere else to spin their webs.  The Trust has received calls about outbreaks at Formonthills in Glenrothes and at its own Geordie\u0027s Wood at Glen Devon with the species enjoying a bumper year across many parts of the country.  George Anderson of the Trust said: \"Every few years this species explodes in numbers and they strip the host tree of its leaves. Trees normally recover the following year so it is not as drastic as it looks.  It does look very sinister as they drape entire trees in their silk. We have had some enquiries from people concerned that they were seeing oak processionary moth.  \"These are a real problem in the south of England and cause severe allergic reactions but thankfully they have not been found in Scotland. It is the bird cherry ermine moth we are seeing at the moment and it is entirely harmless.\"  The bird cherry moth, Latin name Yponomeuta evonymella, has a maximum wingspan of less than an inch and is found all over Europe.  There are hundreds of known species of ermine moths, and most of the time they go completely unnoticed.  But when it comes to spinning elaborate webs, no creature can match the power of ermine moth caterpillars. The behaviour is called \u0026ldquotenting, and only some species are able to manage it.  Every now and again, thousands of the tiny moths show up en masse and it is happening more frequently.  By working together, they are able to conceal themselves in a protective blanket. Like a giant invisibility cloak, the veil confuses birds and other predators well enough to keep them at bay while the caterpillars feed.  As the ermines move from tree to tree, they have to cover their tracks and so they keep their protection with them.  Over time everything in their path, from cars, to street signs, to grass, becomes shrouded in white, a scene which has been nicknamed the \u0026ldquowalk of ghosts.  One theory suggests that the super-webs form when multiple females lay their eggs on the same plant, in areas where food is scarce such as housing developments.  Other experts suggest that climate change is having an impact as the eggs tend to do better over warm and damp winters.  Experts believe that the sever storms which swept in from Siberia in March followed relatively shortly after by a prolonged heatwave has provided perfect conditions for the moths, while killing off their parasitic predators.  Tom Prescott, Senior Conservation Officer at Butterfly Conservation Scotland said: \"They are targeted by parasitic wasps and flies who enter their bodies and hatch out when the moths should and kill them off.  \"It\u0027s why they make this incredible web, they hope to keep the parasites and other predators out, it\u0027s like a very large disguise.  \"It just takes two or three to get inside the blanket for the moth numbers to be dramatically reduced, this is why some years there are lots of them, while in other years you can hardly see them.  \"We don\u0027t know for sure but the cold spell could have hit the parasites numbers while the recent warm spell has made it great for the caterpillars, one minute it was grey and overcast and the Spring and Summer both seemed to appear at once.  \"We have another species in Scotland, the Marsh Fritillary, which spins similar webs to protect it from its only known parasite, but there are smaller numbers of them and its population fluctuates much more from year to year.  \"But in truth, we don\u0027t really understand everything about the bird cherry ermine months and the webs but it can certainly put on a show\"."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/7951720.jpg?type=article-full","title":"Which town has been named Scotland s best for quality of life ","story":"              IT is chiefly known as the birthplace of the poet Hugh MacDiarmid and the ancestral home of the first man to walk upon the moon.\u0026nbsp  But now the small Dumfrieshire town of Langholm can add another feather in its cap after being named as one of the best places to live in Scotland.\u0026nbsp  The Royal Mail group \u0026nbsphas declared that the settlement on the River Esk, population 2300, is the best \u0027market town\u0027 for quality of life north of the border after examining a host of criteria including the average earnings of its inhabitants, the cost of living and the low rate of crime.\u0026nbsp  READ MORE:\u0026nbspIf you\u0026rsquore looking for the best quality of life in Scotland, move to the country  The home of one of the famous border town common ridings, Langholm can be found nudging onto the A7 but miles from anywhere else.\u0026nbsp    Royal Mail said the town scored highly across all categories it looked at, based on census data as well as Scottish Government social statistics and informations on schools, land use and house prices. \u0026nbsp  Once known as the \u0027muckle town\u0027 because of its bustling woollen mills and burgeoning population, it was once home of bloodthirsty families of reivers who fought and raided among themselves for centuries.

The then prime minister sheltered from torrential downpours in a cottage belonging to his wife Samantha\u0026rsquos millionaire stepfather.  At least that is what newspaper reports said. In fact, the whitewashed lodge where the Camerons and their three children hid from the weather was part of a 20,000-acre estate formally owned by a firm registered in the Bahamas.  The Scottish Government on Wednesday announced detailed proposals to try to expose the true owners of land - rather than untraceable firms at PO Boxes in the Caribbean or Channel Islands.  In a statement, the government said it wanted to create a register which, if agreed, would \u0026ldquoreveal for the first time the controlling interests of land owned by trusts and overseas companies.  Land reform minister Roseanna Cunningham added: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos no longer acceptable for the identity of people making decisions about land in Scotland to be obscured. Our proposals go further than any existing UK legislation. We\u0026rsquore putting Scotland at the forefront of this policy in Europe.  Scotland\u0026rsquos currently opaque property registry - title searches are expensive and often end with a secretive tax haven address - means it is far from clear how much of the country is owned offshore.  The Sunday Post earlier this year said some \u0026pound2.9 billion worth of land was held by 776 companies registered in 22 secrecy jurisdictions.  The BBC this year checked the land registry of England and Wales and found nearly 100,000 properties registered offshore, a quarter of them in the British Virgin Islands.  Land campaigner Andy Wightman - who exposed the offshore ownership of the Camerons\u0026rsquo holiday home on Jura - reckons 750,000 acres of Scotland is owned in tax havens. Foreign investors have been buying up prime Edinburgh real estate, including property close to Nicola Sturgeon\u0026rsquos official residence, Bute House.    Bute House  Rachel Davies Teka of Transparency International said: \u0026ldquoAnonymous ownership of property is a key method used by corrupt individuals to hide their identities and launder illicit funds.  \u0026ldquoOur research has found \u0026pound4.4 billion of property bought with suspicious wealth across the UK with much of this facilitated by the use of anonymous companies registered in secrecy jurisdictions.  She added: \u0026ldquoThis is a positive step by the Scottish Government who are leading the way to open up who really owns land.  \u0026ldquoThis will also act as a deterrent to those seeking to launder money through Scottish property.  Transparency want England and Wales to follow suit.  Mr Wightman also welcomed the move but struck a note of caution after his 20-year-battle for transparency. He said: \u0026ldquoThis new Register will be helpful but it will not be definitive as it relies on self-declaration and will be impossible to verify the true owners based in offshore secrecy jurisdictions.    Roseanna Cunningham  Ms Cunningham said access to the register would be free. Mr Wightman warned that information to which beneficial ownership details would relate to would still be behind a paywall.  Scotland\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquobig land\u0026rsquo lobby said it was supportive of transparency moves. Sarah-Jane Laing, executive director of Scottish Land \u0026amp Estates, said: \u0026ldquoWe fully appreciate that transparency and visibility of ownership is an area where improvement is required and we led the way in publishing our Landowners\u0026rsquo Commitment in 2014 which urged landowners to be open and visible. \u0026ldquo She said her body would review regulations to ensure they are \u0026ldquoboth proportionate and workable  However, the SNP still faces robust opposition on wider reform from vested interests. These include those of Mrs Cameron\u0026rsquos stepfather, Viscount Astor, whose family has effectively owned the Jura estate for nearly century and who has described the beneficial owners of the property as his children.  The hereditary peer, whose full name is William Waldorf Astor III, in 2015 accused the SNP of threatening \u0026ldquoMugabe-style land grabs on landowners. That, said a spokesman for Ms Sturgeon, was \u0026ldquopretty preposterous.  Analysis from Malcom Combe, Law Lecturer, Aberdeen University  \"Land registration is not new to Scotland. The current Land Register was introduced in 1979, and prior to that there was a system of deeds registration that went back to the 17th century.  \"What is happening now \u0026ndash in line with what was provided for in 2016 Land Reform Act -\u0026nbsp is to have a register of who controls a relevant entity that owns land, much like letting agent registration has emerged in the private rented sector.    Malcolm Combe  \"The hope is that this will increase accountability of owners, or at the very least open up channels of communication, which would otherwise have been tricky in situations where, say, the only details of a landowner was an overseas registered office.  \"Interestingly, the draft regulations set out that knowingly or recklessly failing to comply with the information duties that will be associated with the new register will be a criminal offence.  The maximum penalty for those offences is a fine not exceeding \u0026pound5,000, although the stigma of an offence is perhaps the greater penalty. There will be some tricky issues to navigate though, such as how to operate the rules for local trusts or clubs.\""},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/7953768.jpg?type=article-full","title":"What s your favourite Scottish album ","story":"              The Herald is looking to find Scotland\u0027s favourite album. Here\u0027s our writers\u0027 choices - now we want to know yours.  Hats, The Blue Nile, 1989  Just seven songs in length, Hats is a masterpiece of love, loss and redemption writ large over a lush, soulful and at times overwhelmingly beautiful soundscape, inseparable from the city of its birth, Glasgow. Over 25 years, it has offered me endless inspiration and comfort. \u0026ldquoWhen all the rainy pavements lead to you, sings a heartbroken Paul Buchanan on From a Late Night Train. The rainy pavements of Glasgow will always lead to Hats.  Heaven and Las Vegas, The Cocteau Twins, 1990  There were few exotic sounds in early 1990s Glenrothes, but Liz Fraser\u0026rsquos otherworldly voice set over Robin Guthrie\u0026rsquos ethereal soundtrack soaring from my bedroom from was one of them. This most accessible of the Cocteau\u0026rsquos albums is awash with blissed-out grandeur, each exquisite track creating a world all of its own.  High Land, Hard Rain, Aztec Camera, 1983  Could Roddy Frame really only have been 18 when he recorded Oblivious, Walk Out to Winter and We Could Send Letters? East Kilbride\u0026rsquos boy wonder emerges fully formed on this astonishing debut album from 1983, having soaked up the pop, soul and punk influences of his prodigious musical youth, and reimagined them as the perfectly-crafted jangle-heavy creations he gave to the world. The sound of young Scotland has rarely sounded this fresh.  Marianne Taylor  Hope Is Important, Idlewild, 1998  Before they went all REM, Woomble and co produced this startling explosion of singalong hooks, soft-loud dynamics and crashing guitars with one song (A Film For The Future) that could sum up manic pop rock thrills for aliens.  Django Django, Django Django, 2012  Their insatiable rockabilly-tinged surf rock is a staple on my playlist and while the latest album has two of their best tunes, their Mercury-nominated debut was the real eyeopener.    Architect, C Duncan, 2015  The debut bedroom-produced, genre-hopping classical-meets-dream pop meets-space folk, featuring harmonies straight out of The Carpenters songbook, remains an ear-opening wonder that deserved to win the Mercury.  Martin Williams  City to City, Gerry Rafferty, 1978.  Not so much for the two big hits, Baker Street and Right Down the Line, but more for Whatever\u0026rsquos Written in Your Heart. Rafferty at his introspective best.  Listen to City to City  A Walk Across the Rooftops, The Blue Nile, 1984  Tinseltown in the Rain, of course, from the band\u0026rsquos debut album. There\u0026rsquos Killermont Street by Aztec Camera but Tinseltown is the ode to Glasgow.  On Stolen Stationary, Michael Marra, 1991  Hermless. Marra at his witty best. The ultimate self-effacing anthem for our national football team. Such mischievous fun, too.  Barclay McBain  Treasure, The Cocteau Twins, 1984  I was a devout follower of John Peel\u0026rsquos radio show, a late-night portal to a different dimension and it was here I first heard the strange, ethereal, beguiling sounds of Liz Fraser and the Cocteau Twins, beamed through into my bedroom and my brain, like the best alien invasion ever. Not only was Liz from Earth, however, she was from Grangemouth, just down the road. After 30-odd years of listening, I still have absolutely no idea what she\u0026rsquos singing about, nor do I care. Just turn it up and let me dream.  Songs from Northern Britain, Teenage Fanclub, 1997  A long, long time ago, at a festival not too far from here, a man thrust a microphone in my face and asked me what Teenage Fanclub meant to me. In the second it took me to open my mouth to reply, they vanished. Collecting my thoughts from the comfort of a chemical toilet, I mused on the question. They are the band equivalent of your best friend, a constant. Always there, always dependable, the soundtrack to your greatest triumphs and most crushing defeats, they have your back, always ready with a smile and a hug. Cheers, pals.    The Three EPS, The Beta Band, 1998  Ok, so technically not an album, but three EPs gathered together for your listening pleasure. When John Cusack\u0026rsquos character in the film High Fidelity puts the Three Eps in his record shop, customers stop in their tracks. What\u0026rsquos this? they ask, \u0026ldquoit\u0026rsquos good! To which Cusack replies, smugly, I know. If only everyone did.  Lian Thomson  Sulk, The Associates, 1982  Of course, as any fool knows, 1982 is the annus mirabilis of Scottish pop (the fact that I was 19 that year may or may not be related). Above all else there was Sulk, the highpoint of new pop (alongside ABC\u0026rsquos Lexicon of Love), and Dundee\u0026rsquos finest gift to the culture. Alan Rankine and Billy McKenzie made pop music that was wilder, stranger and, yes, sexier, than everyone else that year. Party Fears Two is a song that is a song that teeters on the cusp of madness and is giddy at the very thought of it. It\u0026rsquos not even the best thing on the album.  Bones You Have Thrown Me and Blood I\u0026rsquove spilled, Kathryn Joseph, 2015  Because I believe every word she sings.  I\u0026rsquove Seen Everything, Trashcan Sinatras, 1993  Presuming that Lloyd Cole\u0026rsquos Commotion-less albums don\u0026rsquot qualify (if they did, then Don\u0026rsquot Get Weird on Me would be a shoo-in), let\u0026rsquos go with the second album from Ayrshire\u0026rsquos finest exports. I\u0026rsquom not sure it\u0026rsquos better than their precocious debut Cake, but the bittersweet autumnal yearning of Earlies is the most gorgeous Scottish song no one has heard of.  Teddy Jamieson  This Is The Story, The Proclaimers, 1987  Its seminal track Letter From America was a soaring cry of solidarity for beleaguered working class communities across Scotland. The line \u0026ldquoBathgate no more \u0026ndash referring to the British Leyland plant which closed in 1984 \u0026ndash made this West Lothian youngster feel like someone was listening.  Listen to\u0026nbspLetter from America:\u0026nbsp  Popped In Souled Out, Wet Wet Wet, 1987  Ah, heady gems such as Wishing I Was Lucky, Angel Eyes and Sweet Little Mystery crooned by dreamboat Marti Pellow (err, what? I was nine). I played this album so often that the tape inside the cassette stretched and snapped. I saved up my pocket money and bought another.  The Hush, Texas, 1999  It was the soundtrack to my first newspaper job as a trainee reporter at the Basingstoke Gazette, the smoky-voiced tones of Sharleen Spiteri \u0026ndash singing Summer Son and In Our Lifetime \u0026ndash played through the tinny headphones of my Sony Discman.    Susan Swarbrick  All You Need Is\u0026hellip.Love and Money, Love and Money, 1986  Because it was the first album I ever owned (on cassette) because I loved James Grant\u0026rsquos voice and because it was a bit edgy and angry and I wasn\u0026rsquot either of those things, normally. It made me feel a bit dangerous.  Fruits of Passion, Fruits of Passion, 1987  A sadly-neglected pure pop classic \u0026ndash why oh why, did this wonderful band get left behind when the likes of Texas, Deacon Blue and Del Amitri soared? Pure, perfect vocals and singalong joy.  Listen to Kiss Me Now  Creeping up on Jesus, The Big Dish, 1988  I know it wasn\u0026rsquot as well received as their first album, Swimmer, but I always liked the happy, poppy feel of this one and it reminds me of driving around the north of Scotland in the summer sunshine with my love, when we were young and free as birds\u0026hellip  Ann Fotheringham  Bandwagonesque, Teenage Fanclub, 1991  It was not their first album, but Bandwagonesque thrust Teenage Fanclub into the indie big league. From opening track The Concept to the closing echoes of Is this Music?, it is jam-packed with all the qualities fans have come to love about Bellshill\u0026rsquos finest four-piece: Byrds-influenced, melody-rich songs delivered in an endearing, gently shambolic fashion.  The Beta Band, The Three Eps, 1998  Though technically a compilation, this laid out their manifesto more than any album from this cult Scots combo \u0026ndash a gloriously languid, ramshackle assembly of loose, off-kilter tunes, embroidered with hints of funk and electronica. They have never sounded better.  Music Has The Right To Children, Boards of Canada, 1998  The debut album of Scots electronic duo Boards of Canada is, for many, the high watermark for ambient electronic music. Two decades on from its release, its influence continues to be recognised and celebrated \u0026ndash and rightly so.  Scott Wright  Screamadelica, Primal Scream, 1991  It sounded in 1991 like it was made in the future and in 2018 it could have been recorded yesterday. Movin\u0026rsquo on Up really ought to be the national anthem. Stands out on its own.  Listen to Loaded  Grand Prix, Teenage Fanclub, 1995  Bellshill meets the US West Coast with predictably dreamy results. There is not a weak track on it and some of the lyrics would make a statue well up.  Psychocandy, The Jesus and Marychain, 1985  It wasn\u0026rsquot all madness and fighting in the Reid family. This album sees them flirt with the Beach Boys and, pun intended, they pull it off. Just Like Honey is perfection.  Neil Cameron  The Midnight Organ Fight, Frightened Rabbit, 2008  A decision to avoid albums detailing the painful end of a long-term relationship after the end of my own stopped me listening to Midnight Organ Fight for a few years, but diving back in was like meeting an old friend in the pub. It\u0026rsquos painful but cathartic. Like all of the late Scott Hutchison\u0026rsquos work, it makes you feel like it\u0026rsquos okay to be sad.  I Am An Island, Fatherson, 2014  My first experience of drinking alcohol was at a Fatherson gig in our hometown of Kilmarnock circa 2009, so their music has always been riddled with nostalgia for me. Their debut album is special because it taps into that difficult phase of growing up in, and moving out of, a small town that can sometimes feel desperate to pull you back.  The Bones of What You Believe, Chvrches, 2013  The juxtaposition of pop melodies and dark lyrics is the USP of this album, which can be appreciated on both a surface level and deeper, with every move having been intricately created by the three musicians. Lauren Mayberry brings a new a level of vulnerability to the genre which makes Chvrches stand out from the rest.  Holly Lennon  Hats, The Blue Nile, 1989  Heartache, the joy of human connection and a love letter to rainy Glasgow by night from a voice wrought with emotion. I\u0026rsquom forever grateful to my brother, Ewen, for the first hearing of the Downtown Lights, beyond his bedroom door.  Garbage, Garbage, 1995  Thrilling soundtrack to the giddy, alcohol-fuelled anticipation of student nights out, sung by the first cool ginger frontwoman I had ever seen.  These Streets, Paolo Nutini, 2006  The ache of leaving home and impermanence of first love refreshingly articulated in Nutini\u0026rsquos Paisley brogue with a maturity beyond his years.    Caroline Wilson  Solid Air, John Martyn, 1973  Superb guitar playing, great songs and Martyn\u0026rsquos trademark slurred jazzy vocals make this a fascinating album, like nothing we\u0026rsquod ever heard before. Martyn had star quality and talent in abundance but he also had a self-destructive streak and simply did what he liked, on and off stage, and never made the \u0026ldquobig time. He made other great albums, notably One World, but this is him at his peak.  Listen to Solid Air  White Album, Average White Band, 1974  Great songs, astonishing double lead vocal from Alan Gorrie and Hamish Stuart, fabulous funky drumming from Robbie McIntosh and the Dundee Horns of Ball on Pick Up The Pieces, this topped both the UK and US charts. Black American artists couldn\u0026rsquot believe the band were white, never mind Scottish, when they heard it. Still a classic 44 years on.  Sunshine on Leith, The Proclaimers, 1988  A clutch of superb self-written songs, the Reid twins singing in their own accents (very unusual back then), a great session band and Pete Wingfield\u0026rsquos sensitive production turned this into a classic. Hell, they even made a musical and film based on it. Thirty years on and we\u0026rsquore still singing along with the choruses.  Frank Morgan  Exploited, Troops of Tomorrow, 1982  \u0026ldquoSomething\u0026rsquos happened/what\u0026rsquos gone wrong/Going down the dole/got to sign on/Millions of kids with nowt to do/You better watch out they\u0026rsquore after you. It\u0026rsquos 1982, the country is falling apart and Edinburgh\u0026rsquos Wattie Buchan and Big John Duncan have the perfect response. Fast, angry, hardcore punk.  Twilight Sad, Forget the Night Ahead, 2009  An uncompromising post-rock wall of sound, with uncompromising Scottish accents. Like nothing I\u0026rsquod heard before. What The Proclaimers would sound like if they were a Chem19 band channelling Nine Inch Nails.  Test Dept, Brith Gof, Gododdin, 1989  Pipes and drums and tribal soul \u0026ndash this was the sound of Europe\u0026rsquos ancient minorities refusing to fade away. Angus Farquhar\u0026rsquos finest musical moment before coming a full-time arts revolutionary with NVA.  Garry Scott  I\u0026rsquove Seen Everything, Trashcan Sinatras, 1993  From post-Smiths jangleism on their debut the Ayrshire gang blossomed to reveal an emotionally rich and enduring marriage of musicality and lyrical nous never before seen within spitting distance of Irvine or anywhere else, crowned by flawless performances by one of Scottish pop\u0026rsquos most devastating singers, Eddi Reader\u0026rsquos younger brother Frank.  Avocet, Bert Jansch, 1979  One for the diaspora. Released as punk morphed into post-punk and new wave, the Edinburgh-born guitarist\u0026rsquos 12th studio album came from another world entirely. Around the theme of wading birds he weaves a fabric of folk, jazz and improvised playing that never loses its capacity to enthral.  Bones You Have Thrown Me and Blood I\u0026rsquove Spilled, Kathryn Joseph, 2015  Irrefutable evidence that the best music doesn\u0026rsquot belong to the distant past, Glasgow-based Aberdonian Kathryn Joseph\u0026rsquos hard-won success with her debut was fuelled in equal measure by her powerfully emotional music, glorious enthusiasm and unwillingness to mask the fact that when you reach 40 there\u0026rsquos some baggage you either can\u0026rsquot or don\u0026rsquot want to leave behind, so best use it to stoke the fire of creativity.

Mr Yousaf met with Common Weal earlier this year \u0026ndash just months before he is due to make an announcement on the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos plans for a public sector bid to take over the railways.  He initiated the meeting with the left-wing \u0026ldquothink and do tank to discuss a paper it produced with the transport union TSSA, which also suggested creating a unified public transport body for Scotland\u0026rsquos buses, trains, trams and ferries.  The document, entitled A Public Future for Scotland\u0026rsquos Railways, argues the current franchise system should be abolished to prevent the railways being taken back into private ownership if a public bid takes over.  It states: \u0026ldquoWhile the system of tendering out time-limited contracts for operating Scotland\u0026rsquos railways remains, even the most popular and efficient public-sector operator will suffer from the lack of certainty which inhibits long-term thinking in the railways today, as it would face the very real prospect of losing its right to operate the franchise every five to ten years.  \u0026ldquoIn order to allow us to enjoy the full rewards publicly-run railways have the potential to bring, the Scottish Government should seek the power to abolish the franchise system, and instead allow ScotRail to be operated permanently on a public-sector basis.  The paper argues \u0026ldquomuch of the transformative potential of the idea of publicly-run railways in Scotland relies on it being a permanent break with decades of privatisation and market-oriented policy.  It references the InterCity East Coast franchise, which was run by a state-owned operator between 2009 and 2015, and argues a publicly-owned rail company could make substantial cuts to ticket prices.  It also suggests three governance models: a new public arm\u0027s-length rail company, a unified public transport body, or a co-operative partially owned by workers and passengers.  In an entry on Holyrood\u0026rsquos lobbying register, Common Weal writes: \u0026ldquoWe were asked to provide our advice and opinion on [the] plans and to offer suggestions as to what other aspects of the recommendations in our paper could be prioritised.  Dr Craig Dalzell, head of policy and research at the think tank, said Mr Yousaf had been interested in \u0026ldquothe report in the round.  The transport minister is currently preparing a bid to take over the railways, with a statement on the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos plans due within days.  A public-sector bid by state-owned ferry operator CalMac is understood to be one of the favoured options.  But current operator Abellio has repeatedly said it would have \"no problem competing with a public bid\".  Scottish Tory transport spokesman Jamie Greene said the meeting with Common Weal \u0026ldquoshould send alarm bells ringing.  He said: \u0026ldquoSeeking views of this type simply signals that instead of just pushing for a public operator to run our railways, the transport minister is in fact open to full monopolised nationalisation, at any cost.  He added: \u0026ldquoTenders and franchises offer a transparent process which get the best available operator at the best cost to the public purse.  A Transport Scotland spokesman said: \u0026ldquoOur consistent view over many years is that there ought to be a level playing field between the private and public sector in bidding for rail franchises.  \u0026ldquoIt is vital that we take the time to think through the various scenarios as ministers want to enable a competitive public sector bid which offers best value for the public purse while delivering continuous service improvements. We expect to give an update on this over the coming weeks.\""},{"url":null,"title":"Donor breast milk bank in line for   300 000","story":"              More than 2,100 premature and sick babies will benefit from a \u0026pound300,000 boost for Scotland\u0027s donor milk bank.  Public Health Minister Aileen Campbell announced the three-year funding package which will also give mothers struggling with breast feeding in the early stages access to the donor breast milk.

The figure was more than twice the \u0026pound191m underspend of the year before.  Announcing the outturn figure for 2017-18, Finance Secretary Derek Mackay told MSPs the fiscal budget had been \u0026pound31.4bn, but expenditure \u0026pound30.9bn.  However he stressed most of the unspent money was already committed, including \u0026pound100m for a new social security system, and all the money would be spent by the Scottish Government, not returned to the Treasury.  He said that for the second year running, income from devolved taxes was up, with total provisional income from Land \u0026amp Buildings Transactions Tax and Scottish Landfill Tax reaching \u0026pound706m, \u0026pound50m above forecasts, and \u0026pound73 million, or 12 per cent, up on 2016-2017.  He said that the net extra being carried forward into 2018/19 was \u0026pound66m, or just 0.2 per cent of the overall fiscal budget, and that this would be done through the Scotland Reserve pot, making it available \u0026ldquoto support management of future budget volatility.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe 2017-18 provisional outturn results show that once again the Scottish Government has prudently and competently managed Scotland\u0026rsquos finances.  \u0026ldquoUnder the current devolution settlement, the Scottish Parliament is not permitted to overspend its budget. As a consequence, we have consistently adopted a position of controlling public expenditure to ensure we live within the budget control limits that apply.  \u0026ldquoThese underspends represent a fraction of our overall budget, but will be carried forward to support this year\u0026rsquos budget and increase our reserves.  \u0026ldquoWe will continue to maintain a firm grip on Scotland\u0026rsquos public finances to mitigate the negative impact Brexit will have on Scotland\u0026rsquos economic outlook.  Labour MSP James Kelly said the underspend was \u0026ldquonothing short of a scandal, given ministers had cut \u0026pound1.5bn from councils since 2011, and demanded Mr Mackay apologise to workers facing the axe while he sat on an \u0026ldquoSNP government slush fund.  He said: \u0026ldquoMoney is piling up in his slush fund for his annual bribe to win Green votes to get his budgets passed.  \u0026ldquoThis is simply a gross mismanagement of the Scottish finances by a Finance Secretary who is clearly out of his depth. Derek Mackay must apologise to communities across Scotland that have been damaged by his reckless actions.  Tory Murdo Fraser added: \u0026ldquoDerek Mackay might like to fool us all into thinking this \u0026pound453m underspend figure is an insignificant sum. But it\u0026rsquos higher than what the SNP\u0026rsquos independence blueprint [Growth Commission] said it would cost to create a separate state.  \u0026ldquoThe finance secretary is having to put money aside to meet a projected shortfall in tax revenues due to Scottish economic underperformance."},{"url":null,"title":"Bank Holiday plan if home nation reaches World Cup Final","story":"              The UK should have an extra bank holiday whenever one of the home nations\u0027 football teams reaches the final of the World Cup, the shadow foreign secretary has said.  Emily Thornberry was famously sacked from the Labour front bench in 2014 for a tweet apparently sneering at a white van driver\u0027s display of the cross of St George on his house months after the last World Cup.  But she sought to repair relations with the nation\u0027s fans by offering the prospect of a day off to nurse hangovers the morning after an appearance by England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland in the final game of the tournament.  And she called on the Royal Mail to \"reconsider\" its decision to ban postmen from flying the flag on their vans.  She admitted she was not herself a fan of the game - and proved her point by going on to suggest the World Cup came round \"every five years\" - but insisted she did not think there was anything wrong with supporters displaying the flag.  \"I think one of the things about the World Cup is that we do get lots of flags out and I think that there\u0027s nothing wrong with that,\" she said.  \"If it\u0027s true, these reports we are hearing from the Royal Mail, I do hope that they reconsider because I think that there is no problem with this at all. This is a time for us to celebrate.\"  Ms Thornberry\u0027s comments came at a speech to journalists at a Westminster lunch, where she was greeted with a display of England flags laid on by reporters who were not about to let her forget the biggest gaffe of her political career.  But a smiling Islington South MP took the joke on the chin, telling reporters that in her north London constituency there were all sorts of flags on show during the World Cup.  \"I can\u0027t pretend that I have the greatest interest in football, and I suspect that there\u0027s quite a lot of people like that,\" she said.  \"But I tell you how you could get more interest in football. What about if the Government were to suggest, for example, that if one of the nations of the United Kingdom were to get into the finals... the next day will be a bank holiday?  \"Why don\u0027t we do that every five years and that would help to get everybody behind whichever team it was?\"  Ms Thornberry branded Theresa May a serial liar as she issued an impassioned plea for more honesty in politics.  She said she would personally be ready to take TV presenter Richard Madeley\u0027s \"three strikes and you\u0027re out\" challenge of having an interview shut down if she did not give a straight answer - as happened to Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson last month.  Ms Thornberry said there had been an \"increasing normalisation of dishonesty in modern politics\", citing the rise of US President Donald Trump as a sign that even the most senior politicians are now ready to say things they know to be untrue.  \"This normalisation of dishonesty has also crept into all sides of British politics, in part I believe as a result of the debate around Brexit,\" she said.  She named the European Research Group of Tory backbenchers and the pro-EU Back Together group of MPs, who she said were each engaged in \"earnest debate\" about how to get the best Brexit deal, when in fact one side wanted no deal and the other did not want to leave the EU at all.  And she added: \"Just look at the Prime Minister who, in the space of one interview last Sunday, claimed that she would fund a \u0026pound20 billion boost on NHS spending primarily through the \u0027Brexit dividend\u0027.  \"She claimed that the Brexit transitional period would definitely finish at the end of 2020. She claimed that she had not misled Dominic Grieve and Anna Soubry on the \u0027meaningful vote\u0027 amendment.  \"And after all that she had the sheer chutzpah to say - and I quote - that she is a woman of her word.\"  Ms Thornberry said: \"When it comes to what Jeremy (Corbyn) has called straight-talking honest politics and the kind of approach I\u0027ve outlined today, that does mean setting your standards high.  \"And, yes, it means we will fail those standards from time to time and we will be criticised and mocked as a result. But I would far rather that than having no standards at all.  Answering questions from Westminster journalists, Ms Thornberry declined three times to discuss allegations that Labour general secretary Jennie Formby was previously a member of Militant, insisting she did not know if that was the case.  And said she had smoked cannabis \"a long time ago\", but no longer thought it should be legalised for recreational use."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/7957319.jpg?type=article-full","title":"Scots hotel adds midge burgers  delicacy  to the menu as  a bit of fun ","story":"              A SCOTS hotelier has claims to have created a burger from midges which has he describes as a \"delicacy\" that has proved surprisingly popular with guests.

A new study found those with the neurological disorder had twice the levels of two strains of herpes, HHV-6A and HHV-7, than those without the condition.  The research, published in journal Neuron, offers \"the most compelling evidence ever\" pointing to a possible viral trigger for Alzheimer\u0027s, the authors said.  Experts stressed it was not clear if the viruses caused dementia or were caused by it.  The study, using evidence from post-mortem brain tissue, was carried out by researchers from Mount Sinai Health System in New York in the US.  Lead author Dr Joel Dudley said: \"If it becomes evident that specific viral species directly contribute to an individual\u0027s risk of developing Alzheimer\u0027s or their rate of progression once diagnosed, then this would offer a new conceptual framework for understanding the emergence and evolution of Alzheimer\u0027s at individual, as well as population, levels.\"  Sam Gandy, professor of neurology and psychiatry, and co-author of the study, said: \"This is the most compelling evidence ever presented that points to a viral contribution to the cause or progression of Alzheimer\u0027s.\"  Studies have previously suggested that viruses might be linked with Alzheimer\u0027s but the new research suggests a relationship between viruses and the activity of genes associated with the disease.  Dr James Pickett, head of research at Alzheimer\u0027s Society, said: \"The relationship between viruses and Alzheimer\u0027s disease has been an area of interest for researchers for a while, but it is still unclear if higher levels of viruses cause dementia or are caused by it.\"  Dr David Reynolds, chief scientific officer at Alzheimer\u0027s Research UK, said the viruses highlighted in the study were not the same as those that caused cold sores.  Instead they were much more common forms which most people carried, usually without any problems.  He added: \"While the findings indicate a link between the activity of these viruses and Alzheimer\u0027s, they don\u0027t tell us whether they contribute to the development of the disease, help the brain to cope with the disease, or just occur alongside Alzheimer\u0027s processes without having an impact on the health of the brain.\""},{"url":null,"title":"FMQs sketch  Sun  sea and sarcasm","story":"              THE summer slump has come early to FMQs.

Nicola Sturgeon and John Swinney exchanged a glance. There are schools in our constituencies? But the issue never caught fire, kept damp by a fog of stats and jargon.  Scottish LibDem fixture Willie Rennie then provided some entertainment amid the droning flies and dust motes.  He was unhappy about tests for five year olds. \u0026ldquoFive year olds, he kept repeating to annoy the teacher, not unlike, well, a three-year-old.

The UK Environment Secretary said proposals for a five-year transition period in which farming subsidies would continue after Brexit were \u0026ldquotaking a leaf out of his department\u0026rsquos book.  It comes as Scottish Secretary David Mundell accused the SNP of mining \u0026ldquofake grievance\", despite engaging positively with UK ministers behind the scenes.  Earlier this week, the SNP outlined post-Brexit plans for Scottish farmers that would see subsidies kept in place and Brussels red tape slashed over a five-year transition period.  It said the proposals went further than the UK Government, which has said all subsidies provided by the EU will continue until the end of the current parliamentary term in 2022.  But visiting the Royal Highland Show in Edinburgh, Mr Gove said: \"I think they\u0027re taking a leaf out of our book.  \"They understand that life outside the European Union means you can remove some bureaucracy from the lives of farmers, and that has to be a good thing.\"  He insisted the UK Government\u0026rsquos consultation on the future of farming had been very well received, adding: \" I think [that] suggests the path that we want to take agriculture south of the border is one that\u0027s got universal support.  \"Here in Scotland we respect the fact there is a devolved administration that will make its own decisions, but it\u0027s encouraging that the direction of travel the Scottish Government wants to take is one that\u0027s following in our footsteps.\"  Mr Gove also pledged that Scottish farmers would always receive \u0026ldquospecial treatment because they face unique challenges.  He was questioned about a long-anticipated review into the distribution of EU farm subsidies between Scotland and the rest of the UK, amid claims Scottish hill farmers are owed \u0026pound160m from the Treasury.  He said: \"We\u0027re going to make sure that Scotland receives the support that it needs in the future.  \"And we\u0027re going to make sure that the unique circumstances of Scotland\u0027s geography and Scotland\u0027s farming sector are reflected in the allocations that we make in the future.\"  Mr Gove said he hoped an Agriculture Bill detailing the UK Government\u0027s plans for farming post-Brexit would be published at the end of July.  Scottish Secretary David Mundell said the message from the SNP at Westminster was \u0026ldquolets weaponise Brexit as an opportunity to take forward independence.

The Chancellor used his annual Mansion House speech to City figures in London to confront attacks from Brexiteer critics, who have condemned the financial department on his watch.  In front of an audience including Bank of England governor Mark Carney, Mr Hammond said the Treasury would be the \"champion of prosperity for the British people\" after Brexit but it would be \"working and trading closely\" with the EU.  His words followed a secret recording of Boris Johnson, the Foreign Secretary, who was heard describing the financial heart of the UK Government as \"basically the heart of Remain\".  As well as recognising Britain\u0027s EU membership since 1973 and the importance of trade, the Chancellor said the post-Brexit landscape should reflect the scale of goods travelling between Dover and Calais, continental defence and security co-operation and \"centuries of shared history and culture\".  He explained: \"So as we leave the EU we need to forge a new relationship with our European neighbours that protects those patterns of trade those business relationships that have been painstakingly built over decades...that maintains low friction borders and open markets.  \"That does not make the Treasury, on my watch, \u0027the enemy of Brexit\u0027 rather, it makes it the champion of prosperity for the British people outside the EU but working and trading closely with it.  \"And part of that successful future partnership must be a mechanism that enables UK EU financial services trade to continue delivering the benefits of open markets and deep regulatory co-operation.  \"Of course, we recognise that this will be a new kind of relationship, reflecting a new, and fair, balance of rights and responsibilities.\"  At the start of June, Theresa May said she had full confidence in Mr Johnson after he told a private dinner there was a risk Brexit \"will not be the one we want\" and would keep the UK \"locked in orbit\" around the EU.  At the gathering of the Conservative Way Forward, a Thatcherite campaign group, he claimed negotiations were approaching a \"moment of truth\" and warned of a Brexit \"meltdown\".  That followed criticism from Priti Patel, the former International Trade Secretary, who accused the Chancellor and the Prime Minister of \"negativity\" and urged a \"better vision for the future\" after Brexit.  Mr Carney used his own speech on Thursday night to say he believed an \"ambitious\" financial services relationship with the EU - founded on commitments to achieving equivalent outcomes and supervisory cooperation - remained \"feasible\".  Echoing the Government\u0027s mantra of a post-Brexit \"global\" Britain, he said: \"Having put in place the pillars of responsible, open financial system, we are ready for deeper global financial partnerships with the emerging economies that will be the most important drivers of global growth in the decades ahead.\"  To this end, the Bank would deepen its supervisory co-operation with major emerging economies and develop infrastructure to support cross-border capital flows, he explained.  Mr Carney said it also wanted to help enable UK households and businesses to transact \"anywhere, anytime with anyone whether around the corner or around the world\".  The Canadian used the speech to say that financial services could serve as a template for broader services trade liberalisation.  Responding the Chancellor\u0027s \u0026pound1.2 billion capital injection onto the Bank\u0027s balance sheet, alongside reforms to its framework, the Governor said: \"We now have a balance sheet fit for purpose. One that reflects the Bank\u0027s much wider range of responsibilities including banking supervision, macro-prudential policy and resolution. And the framework enhances our independence, transparency and accountability.\"  The Chancellor also used his speech to announce the creation of a Green Finance Institute based in the capital, jointly funded by government and the City of London.  He also said a Financial Services Skills Taskforce would be set up by TheCityUK, led by former City Minister Mark Hoban, to \"meet the long-term skills needs of the sector over the coming decades and creating opportunities for the next generation\"."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/7958073.jpg?type=article-full","title":"Forgotten history of the  Glasgow Serbs  who took rugby home","story":"              THEY came to Scotland with little more than the clothes upon their backs, refugees from a war which set the continent of Europe ablaze.  Yet when they finally left for home years later, they returned not as heroes of the battlefield but as the conquerors of the rugby pitch, taking a their knowledge of the game back to their native Serbia, where it has flourished.  Most gained their love for the oval ball during a stay at George Heriots School in Edinburgh, where they are fondly remembered.  But now, on the centenary of their greatest triumph, the story of the Serbian rugby boys of Glasgow has been brought to light by a historian of the game in their native country.    Serbia\u0026nbspsuffered greatly during World War One  In August 1916, 27 boys aged between 12 and 19 arrived in Scotland traumatised and bewildered after the tide of war swept over Serbia.  Their home country had held out bravely against the might of the Austria-Hungarian Empire, but had finally been defeated by the combined forces of Germany, Bulgaria and Imperial troops.  More than 100,000 people died fleeing across the Albanian mountains, and the boys were among the weary refugees who survived, arriving in Britain by boat from Corfu.  READ MORE:\u0026nbspObituary - Dougie Jackson, veteran rugby player who played for Scotland and Hawick  Unable to speak a word in English, they were taken in by families and schools, with one group ending up at Heriots and another at Hillhead High School and other establishments in Glasgow.  The youngsters talent for the sport and athletics was quickly noticed, and soon they were introduced to rugby.  Within months, three were playing for the Heriot\u0027s highly regarded first team alongside future Scotland internationals, while in Glasgow 18 were quickly drafted into the teams in their schools.  Many of this group would go on to have substantial careers on the rugby field, according to Slavisa Milenkovic, Secretary of the Krusevac rugby club in Serbia, who has researched their time in Scotland.  He said: \"The Serbian rugby team in Edinburgh was the largest, most organized and of the highest quality, but their story ended in June 1919 when they were left the city.  \"But, the Serbs also played rugby in other Scottish cities they were located in during the First World War, and the best Serbian rugby players performed in Glasgow.\"  In 1918, the boys from Edinburgh and Glasgow formed the first Serbian national team, winning a match played in Edinburgh in front of a crowd of more than 8,000.  This was the first team to even play under the Serbian flag and is still held as the genesis of rugby for the Balkan country.  The same year a group also travelled to Ayr and beat a team from the local Academy, their arrival heralded in a newspaper report entitled \"The Visit of the Serbian Boys\".

The best-known of the Serbs was Slavoljub Djordjevic, who went on to play more than 100 games in Scottish competitions, first for Hillhead and later for Glasgow University Blues, where he studied to be a doctor.    Slavoljub Djordjevic/Stevan George  Djordjevic, a successful fullback, later married a Scottish woman and changed his name to Stevan George. He served as a ship\u0027s surgeon on troop transports during the Second World War and later worked as a doctor on board Cunard liners, eventually settling in the Bahamas.  Mr George, a father-of-three, was later awarded an OBE for his services to the Island communities, died in Nassau aged 67.  Another who enjoyed a long career was Dragoljub Stojanovic, who was a frequent turn-out for Hillhead between 1920 to 1926, playing at all levels.  In Edinburgh, Dimitrije Dulkanovic, who was known as the school\u0027s \"flying wing three-quarter\", also went on to train as a doctor, and set up the country\u0027s first rugby club in Belgrade.  Dr Dulkanovic died in 1995, aged 95, and was buried in his old school tie. He was one of five of the Serbian Herioters to attend the school\u0027s tercentenary in 1959, and continued to visit into the 1980s.

However, the contribution of those who picked up the game in Glasgow has been largely lost to history.  Mr McCallum said: \"The rugby played in Serbia is a direct descendant of the rugby they played in Scotland, particularly at Heriots, and they are very mindful of that.  \"It\u0027s very touching.

Following the dramatic event, Mr Salmond, who himself walked out of the Commons during Chancellor Nigel Lawson\u0026rsquos 1988 Budget statement, suggested he had been the SNP\u0026rsquos inspiration by telling the party leader that targeting interventions on key occasions was the way to make a successful protest.  \"Certainly, that was my advice to Ian Blackford when he phoned me last Tuesday night and I was delighted to see him carry it through,\" explained the former First Minister.

Whether or not they inherit sizeable assets from parents or other relatives will be the most important factor determining their eventual wealth, rather than ability or effort, analysts from the Resolution Foundation claim.  The report says big falls in home ownership rates since are a key factor in the wealth gap for young adults. Home ownership rates fell from 48 per cent in 2003 to 32 per cent today.  Typical Scottish wealth now totals \u0026pound237,000 per household, and the total household wealth in Scotland has now exceeded \u0026pound1 trillion for the first time, the report says.  Overall wealth in Scotland has grown from five times GDP to seven times GDP over the last decade, much faster than incomes which makes it harder to close wealth gaps by earning and saving.  Even a high income family, in the top ten per cent of households with a \u0026pound58,000 income would have to save every penny they earn for 19 years to become \"truly wealthy\" \u0026ndash with assets of over \u0026pound1 million\u0026ndash the report says.  But the reality is 25 per cent of Scots have savings of less than \u0026pound500, and seven per cent have savings of zero, or have current accounts in the red.  The Foundation is calling for politicians to take more account of wealth in policy-making and debates, and said that while reforms of council tax were welcome, it is one of the most significant wealth taxes. As it is devolved, the Scottish Government could do more to make it more accurately reflect property values, the report says.  Torsten Bell, Director of the Resolution foundation, said: \"Wealth in Scotland has grown fast in recent years and will come to play a bigger role in determining life chances in the decades to come.  \"This increase in wealth across Scotland has sat alongside falling home ownership rates, particularly for young families, who are struggling to accumulate wealth as preceding generations have been able to.\"  As a result the \u0027millennial\u0027 generation could be the first since the second world war to earn less than their parents over their lifetime.  \"The accumulation, distribution and taxation of wealth should be at the centre of policy debates in Scotland in the years ahead,\" Mr Bell added. \"If current trends continue it will become much harder in modern Scotland to earn your way to being truly wealth, and young people\u0027s prospects will depend lesson their ability and more on whether or not they inherit assets from relatives.\"  Neil Brennan, director of Fitzallan Ltd, Glasgow-based Chartered Financial Planners\u0026rsquo, said: \"Compared to previous generations, younger people typically stay at home longer, join the job market later and have very high expectations as to standard of living.\"  Many use disposable income for cars, holidays, leisure activities and fashion their parents might have done without, he said. \"Younger generations find it difficult to bridge the \u0026lsquowealth gap\u0026rsquo as they have low savings/high spending habits and do not get onto the housing market as early as their parents.\"  Pension auto-enrolment will help, but young people are starting work later and still do not begin saving for retirement as early as their parents did, he added.  \"As a financial adviser, we would encourage young people to save or investor contribute to pensions, even at modest levels, to get the \u0026lsquopot boiling\u0026rsquo.  \"Many younger people will have to rely on inheritances, even modest ones, to allow them to pay off their mortgages or retire before they are very old.\""},{"url":null,"title":"inverurie menswear firm toasts 100k whisky contract","story":"\t\tPernod Ricard, owners of several prestigious spirit brands, has awarded a \u0026#163100k retail contract to menswear outfitters Gibbs Inverurie.\t\t\t\tA contingent of 875 Chinese are heading across the globe for a 4-day whisky extravaganza in July.

One befriendee said these befrienders are \u0026ldquolike young relations.The benefits of this are twofold. As well as keeping the befriendees company, it gets the young befriendees into the voluntary mind-set early on, encourages them to become more empathetic and confident and it shows they can make a difference.Befriendees also benefit from regular contact with people \u0026ldquoso they feel as though they\u0026rsquore part of the community, according to befriending co-ordinator Elspeth Manson.Angie added: \u0026ldquoHelping someone recognise their worth is a benefit for both the befriendee and the volunteer.The recruitment procedure includes volunteers receiving Protecting Vulnerable Groups (PVG) clearance and providing three references. Once accepted, training includes support from other groups such as stroke awareness, Hearing and Sight Care and Parkinson\u0026rsquos awareness.Befriending Caithness is not a standalone organisation \u0026ndash it is helped by the community.An event to look out for is a fashion show at M\u0026ampCo in Thurso on June 28, starting at 7pm. Tickets cost \u0026pound5 and this will go towards the July summer lunch.As well as being greatly appreciated by co-ordinators, the joy felt by the befriendees is evident.

It will provide on-board workshops, spare parts storage, crane and office facilities but will get supplies from another large vessel. By contrast the BOWL project will use smaller crew transfer vessels on a daily basis to provide crew and supplies.\u0026ldquoIt is just a different strategy being used at MORL and we could not accommodate that size of vessel at Wick as we do not have the shelter and water depth required, he said. \u0026ldquoIf we had our new quay at Shaltigoe we would have been able to accommodate it.But Mr Watt is confident the harbour will still play a part in servicing the MORL project and in other renewable projects in the Moray Firth basin. He pointed out that Wick is 33 kilometres from the wind farm while Fraserburgh is 70km away.\u0026ldquoWe wish Fraserburgh and Moray East well and will continue to develop Wick harbour, Mr Watt said. \u0026ldquoWe will move forward on a strong footing in the renewables market as well as in the fishing and cargo sectors.He added that work on the BOWL base is progressing well and will create upwards of 150 jobs.Caithness civic leader Willie Mackay said: \u0026ldquoIt is very disappointing news. Hopes were high this project could come to Wick. There have been a lot of improvements going on at the harbour which has the potential for a positive future.\u0026ldquoI hope other projects can come to Wick and I look forward to seeing improvements on the platform the BOWL project creates for the town and the community in general. I hope we can bring lots of jobs and apprenticeships to the area.Trudy Morris, chief executive of Caithness Chamber of Commerce, was \u0026ldquovery disappointed by the decision as the Wick harbour team has worked \u0026ldquoextremely hard to make the port an attractive base.\u0026ldquoAs the larger of the two offshore wind projects proposed for this area, it would have been a significant boost to the harbour and the region to have MORL based here, she said.But she added: \u0026ldquoIt has been fantastic to see the progress made at Wick harbour this year in preparing for the Beatrice Offshore Windfarm Ltd operations and maintenance contract, and we look forward to the benefits this will bring to the area.Eann Sinclair, programme manager for the Caithness and North Sutherland Regeneration Partnership, was also disappointed by the decision. However, he is confident there will still be opportunities for Wick harbour to get work in the Moray Firth area.MORL spokesman Craig Milroy said Wick was in the running for the O\u0026ampM base along with Buckie and Fraserburgh. A memorandum of understanding had been signed with Wick.\u0026ldquoAll three were strongly engaged with us but we chose Fraserburgh, he said. \u0026ldquoThere was not a single reason for choosing Fraserburgh but a combination of circumstances.

Few local high street businesses remain in Tain, Mr Stone\u0026rsquos home town.\u0026ldquoThe presence of these empty and increasingly derelict properties undermines one of the most important industries of the Highlands \u0026ndash namely tourism, he says.\u0026ldquoI would therefore suggest that properly tackling this problem should now be one of the most urgent issues for both the UK and Scottish governments.\u0026ldquoThis problem can no longer be ducked by plans that turn out to be more about words than actions \u0026ndash or, worse still, by means of the argument that the decline in the UK\u0026rsquos high street retail sector is inevitable.\u0026ldquoIf we really value our communities and their built heritage, then we must use every means at our disposal \u0026ndash grants, infrastructure investment, tax breaks, local and national planning \u0026ndash so that we can find new ways of bringing these buildings back into sustainable use.Speaking yesterday, Mr Stone said: \u0026ldquoIt pains me greatly to see what is happening, and also to witness nothing better than fine words and hand-wringing when it comes to tackling the problem.\u0026ldquoThis letter is my first move in a campaign that I am going to pursue with the greatest vigour. Tain is my home town and I care about it \u0026ndash and the same is true of the other communities that I have the honour to represent.Friday 22 Jun 2018 7:38 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Sailor in distress proves false alarm","story":"A lifeboat rushed into action on Friday night after a yacht was\u0026nbspreported to be in trouble in the Pentland Firth.A boat was launched from Scrabster, but on nearing the 30-foot vessel\u0026nbspthe RNLI crew ascertained that the sailor \u0026ndash on his way home to Denmark\u0026nbsp\u0026ndash was not in any danger.\u0026ldquoHe was fine, but he\u0026rsquod been struggling with the tides to get through and that was all, said Andy Pearson, the station\u0027s full time mechanic.\u0026ldquoSomebody had obviously seen him dodging through the tides trying to make his way through the Firth, and he was using his experience to get through.Pearson said that the lifeboat stayed with the man \u0026ndash described as \u0026ldquoquite an old experienced sea dog \u0026ndash to make sure he negotiated the Skerries safely.\u0026ldquoSomeone filed a report with good intent and it\u0026rsquos good for us to go out and check that they are ok, he underlined.Thurso is the most northerly RNLI lifeboat station on mainland Scotland.Crews of the Scrabster station\u0026rsquos Severn class all-weather lifeboat have received 17 awards for gallantry.Pearson said that the man was not planning on stopping before sailing across the North Sea to Denmark \u0026ndash a distance of around 450 nautical miles.He stressed that any small vessel low in power should monitor what the tides are doing before they try and negotiate the Firth.\u0026nbspFriday 22 Jun 2018 7:38 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04114000/04114264.jpg","title":"Special delivery for retiring Lybster postie","story":"\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspHe started in 1988, taking over from another postie who was a familiar figure to a certain generation, Donnie Bremner from Mid-Clyth.Thirty years ago Murray had to go over the Ord to Helmsdale to meet the train north to collect the mail then take it to the local sorting offices in Dunbeath and Lybster. All the small local post offices and all the postboxes between Berriedale and Lybster had to have the mail uplifted on this run.Now two trucks each morning bring the mail north from Inverness and Murray has been working mainly, since these changes, on the rural run through Occumster, Roster, Clyth, Bruan and Ulbster.Murray frequently found himself stuck in snow in past winters and has been rescued by farmers pulling him out of drifts in the rural hinterland of south-east Caithness.He served under three postmasters in Lybster \u0026ndash firstly as a part-time postie as well as being a fisherman under the late Hugh Gunn, whose father before him had been the Lybster postmaster. After Hugh retired, Des and the late Mary Somerville took over before handing over to the present incumbent, Duncan Winfield, and wife Gail.One incident in particular has stayed with Murray and harks back to his early days on his rounds. When arriving at the late Annie Bain\u0026rsquos place on the Smerlie road he was implored to catch a ewe that had got loose.Murray jumped the fence and caught it as Annie almost simultaneously thrust her arm up its rear to pull out a new lamb and straight back in for another.After a quick wipe down of the livestock he was then asked if there was anything in the post, almost as if nothing had happened in the previous five minutes. Murray duly delivered Annie\u0026rsquos mail having firstly helped with the other delivery, and on to his next stop.A collection was taken in Lybster Post Office and the money was handed over by local postmaster Duncan Winfield accompanied by wife Gail in a small ceremony on June 6.Friday 22 Jun 2018 7:38 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04110000/04110627.jpg","title":"Wicks Bremner monument gets a facelift","story":"A MONUMENT at Wick in memory of wreck-raiser and civil engineer James Bremner has been given a facelift.\u0026nbspThe Wick Paths Group, which was instrumental in getting the work at the memorial under way, plans to place an interpretive panel at the site telling people about the work Bremner carried out.Group secretary John Bogle said: \u0026ldquoThere are a wealth of stories about James Bremner. I\u0026rsquom sure there are a lot of people who won\u0026rsquot know them.He explained that only the base of the memorial, which was erected in 1903, was still to be refurbished with the interpretation panels set to complete the whole project.The path along by the memorial is on the Wick section of the John O\u0026rsquoGroats Trail, a 147-mile route from Inverness.Mr Bogle pointed out that interpretation panels were already in place on the stretch of the trail through Wick, with one at the Trinkie. However, two existing panels are being moved to the Braehead and North Head.He said the paths were already proving popular with local people and visitors and the group is keen to provide information about the area.Mr Bogle added that the civil engineer\u0026rsquos gravestone \u0026ndash in the graveyard of Wick St Fergus Church \u0026ndash had also been tidied up recently.Wick Harbour Authority chairman Willie Watt MBE said: \u0026ldquoFor me James Bremner is one of the unsung heroes of Caithness. He is just an amazing character. Nothing was too difficult for him and he treated everybody he worked with the greatest of respect. He was a great leader and motivator.Mr Watt pointed out that one of the Wick engineer\u0026rsquos greatest achievements was the refloating of the SS Great Britain \u0026ndash the largest ship of its time \u0026ndash when she ran aground off Ireland in the 1840s.He said that Mr Bremner was sent for from Wick, along with a few of his men, when other engineers had failed in one of the biggest salvage operations of that era.James Bremner (1784-1856) was born at Stain, Keiss. He was an apprentice in a Greenock shipyard and returned to Wick to establish his own shipbuilding business, constructing over 50 vessels in as many years as well as designing and building many harbours. He was involved in the construction of the breakwater at Wick harbour.A local author, John Mowat, once described Mr Bremner as \u0026ldquothe Ulysses of the north and \u0026ldquoour greatest Caithnessian.Mr Bremner is still remembered in Keiss with a plaque at the harbour erected by the Institution of Civil Engineers.Friday 22 Jun 2018 7:38 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"June 21, 2018 at 1:38 pmOrkney has the highest food safety standards in Scotland, according to a recent survey by consumer group Which?.

That simply makes it a must-attend event for Orkney’s premium food and drink firms, giving them the chance to showcase their products to a very wide audience of potential customers. It’s a very busy few days for our producers, but always worth the effort and it also gives us an opportunity to tell the wider story about Orkney and all its other attractions.”Amongst the Orkney businesses travelling to the show will be newcomers, J. Gow Rum, makers of the county’s first locally produced rum.Collin van Schayk of rum producers, VS Distillers, said: “We’re very much looking forward to introducing J. Gow Rum to the visitors at this year’s Royal Highland Show. The reception it’s had since its launch late last year has been fantastic, so we’re really excited about bringing it to a much wider audience, and sharing our story.“One of the strengths of Orkney’s approach to marketing food and drink is the fact local businesses present a united front at these major events.

The plans represent an investment of £125 million for investors and would create 385 new jobs.According to the hotel chain, the letter it has sent to OIC sets out how it has supported 12 local authorities in England and Wales, supporting local regeneration, creating jobs and boosting local economies.With similar letters being sent to 19 other councils in Scotland, including Shetland Islands Council, the hotel chain is attempting to show how it could similarly support local communities around the country.These agreements offer a funding structure which the hotel chain says enables local authorities to utilise their existing assets, create jobs, generate income, and help to regenerate land in strategically important locations.Hotels in the programme are built on surplus local authority land, with the funding provided either through the local authority’s internal resource or via low-cost funding from the Public Works Loan Board or third party resources.Upon completion of the hotel development, local authorities would either have the choice of either retaining ownership of the hotel and receive an annual rent into the council’s revenue budget or selling the hotel with Travelodge as its operator.Brian Wallace, Travelodge chairman said: “Many local authorities are in possession of large amounts of property and assets that are not being utilised. Investing in a low-cost hotel like Travelodge is an increasingly attractive choice, as it draws visitors, creates jobs and helps boost the local economy.”“We operate 44 hotels across Scotland. However, the country is growing at pace and attracting visitors from all corners of the globe but there still remains a huge shortage of good quality and great value hotels. To fill this gap, we want to extend our Scottish network with a further 20 hotels and this includes our first hotel in Kirkwall. To help us achieve this, we are writing to Orkney Council, to invite them to consider how Travelodge can act as a catalyst to drive their local development agenda.”A spokesman for Orkney Islands Council has said the local authority is unable to comment at this stage as to date, a proposal has not been received by the council.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.
