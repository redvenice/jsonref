But there is a majority against No Deal. That means the government is likely to fail in its bid for an early election regardless of the mechanism it chooses.Meanwhile, Downing Street said this morning that prorogation will take place even if it loses the election vote, ruling out trying again using a different mechanism. Is the government still trying to get a deal by October 31?Yes. But there is a major row over just how hard Downing Street is pushing for a deal. Amber Rudd, who quit the government on Saturday night, said yesterday that she believed 90 per cent of Whitehall\u0027s Brexit efforts were now focused on preparing for a No Deal orce. But Number 10 is insistent that its primary goal remains Britain leaving with a deal.           Amber Rudd, pictured arriving at the BBC yesterday, stunned Westminster on Saturday night as she quit the government and surrendered the Tory whipHowever, talks with the EU remain locked in a state of stalemate with the main stumbling block being the Irish border backstop. Mr Johnson said he will not sign up to any Brexit deal that contains the protocol and the EU has said it is open to listening to the UK\u0027s proposed alternatives to the insurance policy. But Mr Johnson is yet to set out in public any concrete plans for how the backstop could be deleted. Meanwhile, today it was claimed that the size of the UK\u0027s negotiating team had been slashed which is unlikely to boost hopes of a deal being done. Downing Street has denied the claim. Many in the government believe that Brussels will only budge at the eleventh hour which could make for a high stakes game of brinkmanship as the Brexit deadline approaches. If the EU and UK cannot agree a deal before October 31, could they agree one after that?Assuming they do agree an extension and there is then an election, potentially. A new prime minister, or the current one, with a big majority would open up new possibilities in the talks with Brussels and could pave the way for a deal being done. Does Amber Rudd\u0027s resignation matter and will other ministers quit? It matters in the sense that it sent a powerful message to Mr Johnson over the direction of the government and the Conservative Party. But it is unlikely to have lasting repercussions - after all, she becomes the 22nd Tory MP to leave the government benches in the space of a week. Ms Rudd\u0027s opposition to No Deal was well known which is why her decision to join Mr Johnson\u0027s Cabinet when he took office raised so many eyebrows. There are a handful of other ministers who are similarly concerned about the prospect of a chaotic split and could quit. They include Northern Ireland Secretary Julian Smith and Culture Secretary Nicky Morgan.  Can the Prime Minister ignore the anti-No Deal law? MPs and peers last week successfully passed a piece of legislation which will force the PM to ask the EU for a Brexit delay if the two sides have not struck an agreement in the run up to October 31. That legislation is expected to make it onto the statute book and receive Royal Assent today. Once that happens there will be a legal requirement on PM to try to push back the Brexit date if a bad break from Brussels is looking likely. Downing Street remains adamant that Mr Johnson will not ask for an extension but ignoring that requirement would trigger a constitutional, political and legal firestorm. If Mr Johnson failed to ask for a Brexit extension at a crunch EU summit on October 17 - as MPs have demanded - it would almost certainly trigger a Supreme Court challenge. The fate of Brexit would then be in the hands of judges and experts believe that Mr Johnson would risk a prison sentence if he tried to flaunt the law. As Lord Sumption said this morning, judges are \u0027not very fond of loopholes\u0027 which means the government could face a hard time convincing them that the PM was correct to defy the legislation.          Jeremy Corbyn, pictured leaving his London home this morning, will tell his MPs to abstain at tonight\u0027s vote on an early general electionSo when will there be a general election?  One thing that almost everyone in Westminster agrees with is that an election will take place before Christmas. It is hard to see how long Parliament could continue to function given the fact that Mr Johnson can no longer command a majority in the Commons after expelling 21 Tory rebels for backing the bid to block No Deal. Minority governments are by their very nature unstable and add to that the fact that a number of parties are keen for an election - most notably the Lib Dems and SNP - and a snap poll appears inevitable. Labour also says publicly that it wants an election which means it is just a matter of timing. Jeremy Corbyn said he would back an election once No Deal has been taken off the table. Assuming that happens towards the end of October, an election could then be held in November. Will the EU agree to delay Brexit again? Brussels has long maintained that it is open to pushing back the UK\u0027s departure date but only if it is for a very good reason: A general election or second referendum. The EU does not want the Brexit stalemate to continue indefinitely and a major democratic event is viewed as potentially the only way to get things moving.  However, the EU will not want to be blamed for a No Deal Brexit - particularly the damage that it could do to the Irish economy - which means when it comes to the crunch the bloc is expected to offer a delay, regardless of the situation. But nothing is guaranteed.   "},{"url":null,"title":"Singer Charlotte Church 33 lodges plans turn home non fee paying private school","story":"Share this article \u0027We see a lot of people feeling completely disengaged or don\u0027t feel that they have a voice, or that their voice matters.\u0027Charlotte will send her two children to the school which would have pupils from \u0027all walks of life\u0027.Pupils would study for qualifications such as GCSEs and BTECs but Charlotte says the school would \u0027still have lots of creative freedom\u0027.Welsh is not currently planned to be taught as a subject - but the pupils would learn the language in a \u0027Welsh kitchen.She said: \u0027I totally believe in the transformation of the whole education system and I think it\u0027s possible.

Marcelo Crivella ordered an Avengers comic book to be removed from a book festival, because it featured two men kissing – a move that triggered a dramatic response from Brazil’s biggest newspaper, Folha de S Paulo, which reproduced the image on its front page, to highlight this attempt at censorship.The mayor was so incensed by Avengers: The Children’s Crusade, he insisted it be given a black plastic wrapper. In a video posted on Twitter, he said it was not right for children “to have early access to subjects that do not agree with their ages”. But to find fault with this kiss is not just bigoted. It shows an ignorance of the origins of same-sex kissing in art.For it was Christian artists who pioneered the gay kiss. Long before Dmitri Vrubel portrayed Communist leaders Leonid Brezhnev and Erich Honecker snogging on the Berlin Wall, or Banksy stencilled his Kissing Coppers on a pub wall in Brighton, it was Catholic art that first explored the joys of men kissing men. Rather than trying to censor Marvel, maybe Crivella should turn his easily offended eyes to the Sistine Chapel in the Vatican. For here, at the very heart of the Catholic world, Michelangelo portrayed men kissing, nearly 500 years ago.In his fresco of the Last Judgment, the souls of the blessed are shown embracing and kissing. Those souls are male and muscular, and some of their smooches are anything but chaste: they hold each other in strong arms, look into each other’s eyes and passionately put mouths to mouths.Michelangelo was known, as he acknowledged to his biographer Ascanio Coni, to love the male body, and was accused of turning the Sistine into a “bathhouse” with all his male nudes. It is time the church acknowledged the central place of homosexuality in his art. A fervent Catholic, Michelangelo was also a philosophically inclined poet whose writings try to reconcile christianity with his sexuality. In poems addressed to his beloved Tommaso dei Cavalieri he argues that by loving male beauty he adores God. The kissing couples in the Sistine Chapel are his ultimate defiance of prejudice. These men express their love openly and proudly – in the house of God. It would do today’s church, as well as the mayor of Rio, a lot of good to acknowledge and embrace the gay message of the greatest of all Catholic artists.Michelangelo could do this because Renaissance Italy had a surprisingly modern understanding of sexual identity. As early as 1304, Giotto portrayed an incandescent moment between Judas and Christ in his frescoes in the Arena Chapel in Padua. As Judas comes in with his lips pursed to plant a kiss on Jesus’s mouth, the Lord looks straight into his eyes with blazing intensity. This is a kiss of betrayal, the sign to arrest Christ – but it is astonishingly intimate.The look in Christ’s eyes is not just angry or condemnatory. It is also loving and accepting – and touched with passion. Giotto must have seen men kiss, or kissed men himself, to paint this. And it was not in some kind of pre-modern, pre-sexual way. For Giotto’s contemporary Dante writes explicitly of men who love men in his Christian epic The Inferno. True, the poet meets these men in Hell. But they include his own poetry teacher Brunetto Latini, towards whom he feels nothing but gratitude and love for “that sweet image, gentle and paternal,  you were to me in the world when hour by hour  you taught me how man makes himself eternal.” The same lucidity with which Dante describes gay identity in The Inferno gives Giotto’s 700-year-old masterpiece its erotic frisson.Lesbian kisses took longer to enter the artistic mainstream, undoubtedly because so few women got the chance to become artists before recent times. But in late 19th-century Paris, Henri Toulouse-Lautrec lived among dancers and sex workers in Montmartre and sympathetically showed their real lives. In his pastel In Bed: The Kiss, he depicts two of his friends sharing a loving and tender kiss. The fact that same-sex desire was so little spoken of in many times and places left scope for fascinating ambiguities. “Kiss me Hardy,” says Nelson as he lies pale and dying on the Victory, a moment captured in paintings by Benjamin West and many others. But what did he mean by it? The fact that artists avoided the actual kisses Hardy gave his close friend suggests people were not so innocent of its implications after all, and it has been argued that Nelson and Hardy were lovers. Marvel’s gay kiss is part of a great artistic tradition that goes back to Giotto and Michelangelo. Christianity needs to embrace this loving heritage, not deny it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a3b66d2edf2c4a024c666237e7a141afda0a8c49/20_18_3736_2241/master/3736.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dc91c67def4415919cd1c55d71a0e34c","title":"british airways cancels virtually all flights on day one of pilot strike","story":"More walkouts planned over pay dispute, with no resolution in sightThe start of a 48-hour walkout by British Airways pilots forced the national carrier to cancel virtually all flights on Monday, with no sign of a resolution ahead of more planned strikes.Heathrow Terminal 5, BA’s main operating hub, was almost deserted, when it would normally be bustling with passengers. BA carries about 145,000 passengers on an average day.Only five BA flights were expected to operate out of about 800 that would normally be scheduled after its first ever pilot strike, called by the union Balpa in a long-running pay dispute. Two of the flights were leases, where the plane and crew are hired under another operator, and the other three are understood to have been flown by non-Balpa pilots in BA’s management team.When an airline starts cancelling or delaying flights for more than three hours, passengers are entitled to compensation of €250-€600 (£230-£550) under EU rules.The cause of the problem has to be under the airline’s control and not an ‘extraordinary circumstance’. Lack of planesstaff, flight overbooking, a strike by airline staff or an IT failure are all considered to be within the airline’s control – so compensation is payable.Passengers on cancelled short-haul flights – up to 1,500km – are entitled to €250 or £230. For flights of 1,500km-3,500km, passengers are entitled to €400, and €600 for the longest flights (more than 3,500km).Compensation is also payable if the plane is delayed. The payments are the same but only kick in when the plane has been delayed three hours for short flights or four hours for the longer trips. The delay is calculated against the time the plane was due to arrive.Passengers are also entitled to ‘assistance’ under the EU rules. Short-haul passengers should receive food and water after two hours. Mid-distance passengers get help after three hours, while long-haul passengers receive it after they have been held in the terminal for four hours. If the delay is overnight, passengers should be provided with hotel accommodation but this often does not happen. This assistance should be provided irrespective of whether the delay is the airline’s fault.The airlines have fought these compensation rules since they were introduced and passengers have had to go to court to get their money. The airlines frequently blame delays on events outside their control. Freak weather events or a last-minute strike by air traffic controllers are deemed to be outside their control. A lack of planes or staff is not.The rules only apply to EU-based airlines or all flights that start in the EU on non-EU based carriers. What will happen after Brexit is not yet clear.\u0026nbspMiles BrignallThe BA chief executive, Álex Cruz, called for “unconditional” talks to continue but Balpa said the airline had refused to commit to meaningful negotiations.BA had spent weeks contacting passengers to offer refunds or to rebook travel to another date or airline since 23 August, when the strike dates were announced.Some of the few travelling through Terminal 5 at Heathrow on Monday morning described BA’s home base as a “ghost town”.While BA was criticised as customers initially struggled to get through to call centres and some were wrongly advised their flights were cancelled, the airline said it had fielded almost 400,000 calls to help customers. Operational problems could continue after the strike because planes and pilots need to be in position for subsequent journeys.BA is expected to start confirming cancellations for late September in the next couple of days, with a further Balpa strike due on 27 September, should the standoff continue.Cruz told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “The commitment of everyone at British Airways is to get over this particular dispute as quickly as possible. We urge the union to please sit down with us as quickly as we can so that we can reach an agreement.”The Balpa general secretary, Brian Strutton, said BA needed to “wake up and realise its pilots are determined to be heard”.He said: “They’ve previously taken big pay cuts to help the company through hard times. Now BA is making billions of pounds of profit, its pilots have made a fair, reasonable and affordable claim for pay and benefits.“BA must now put the needs of its staff and passengers first and accept that its pilots will not be bullied or fobbed off.“The company’s leaders, who themselves are paid huge salaries and have generous benefits packages, won’t listen, are refusing to negotiate and are putting profits before the needs of passengers and staff.”Balpa has estimated that the strike will cost BA £40m a day.BA has said that its pay offer would result in some pilots earning more than £200,000 a year, including allowances, by 2022. However, the union said most pilots earn far less.One striking BA pilot, writing anonymously in the , said he felt “hugely conflicted” but said pilots were not being respected for their loyalty and given credit for additional work.He said: “In the last 10 or 20 years, pilot workloads have significantly increased – and at the same time our pay and pension has been significantly reduced. During all of this process we’ve been told the increased productivity was necessary to ensure our future and create sufficient profit to be able to reinvest.“The investment in new aircraft, seats and service levels have all had much publicity. The share buybacks and shareholder idends, not so much – but they have been substantial, as have the eye-watering increases in senior management remuneration.“We feel the potentially below-inflation pay offer, as the company makes record profits, does not respect our previous loyalty.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d7f7ab14501a20ee32b1eeedbf9839b88c91327d/835_1670_2886_1732/master/2886.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=32ee4cb6d401ab32b885ac099b3cd92f","title":"lloyds ppi claims","story":"Banks underestimated number of last-minute complaints they would receive before deadlineLloyds Banking Group and Barclays have warned they will take billions of pounds in extra charges to cover a last-minute surge in claims relating to mis-sold payment protection insurance (PPI).The lenders said they underestimated the number of complaints they would receive in the run-up to the 29 August deadline and will increase provisions following a spike in claims before the cut-off. Lloyds expects to take another PPI charge of between £1.2bn and £1.8bn in the third quarter, while Barclays expects to put aside between £1.2bn and £1.6bn.Those estimates are sharply higher than the £900m charge announced by Royal Bank of Scotland last week, after the bank said it was also hit by a last-minute rush in claims. CYBG, which owns the Clydesdale and Yorkshire banks and Virgin Money, warned that it faced a potential bill of £450m for new complaints.In total, six of the largest high street banks have announced provisions worth almost £49bn, in order to compensate customers who purchased often worthless cover in what has become the UK’s largest mis-selling scandals.PPI has become the UK’s biggest mis-selling scandal and has forced banks to put aside billions of pounds to compensate customers.We have calculated the total PPI provisions that major UK banks have announced to date:\u0026nbspRoyal Bank of Scotland – £6.2bnTotal PPI provisions announced by major high street banks – £48.7bn\u0026nbsp* NOTE: the tally includes upper-end estimates for third-quarter PPI provisions by Lloyds, Barclays, RBS and CYBGThe sum is almost double the second-largest bill, footed by Barclays, which could reach £11.2bn in the third quarter. Barclays warned that its final PPI bill “will depend on a number of factors, including the quality of recently submitted claims”.Smaller lenders including the Co-operative Bank have also dealt with a late rush in PPI complaints. The lender, which put aside an extra £2.5m in recent months, said last week it received a “substantially greater volume” of claims but stopped short of estimating the resulting costs.PPI provisions are meant to cover compensation and administrative costs. While most lenders have refused to disclose how many workers are processing claims, the  understands that Lloyds has about 6,000 staff – most of whom are contractors – processing PPI claims on its behalf.Lloyds announced on Monday that it was suspending the remainder of its 2019 share buyback programme, given uncertainty around the final costs of the PPI scandal, leaving £600m of the £1.75bn programme unused.The buyback, launched in March, had been a sign of Lloyds’ confidence in the business, despite Brexit. Share buybacks are often an alternative to paying idends to shareholders and can help consolidate ownership and boost stock value by cutting down the number of shares in circulation.Lloyds said it was still committed to increasing its ordinary idend. However, the lender expects capital growth and its return on equity to be below its previous guidance, saying the final outcome will depend on the final PPI bill.Since it started taking claims in 2011, Lloyds has typically received 70,000 PPI information requests a week but this soared to 600,000 to 800,000 a week in the final weeks before the 29 August deadline.Russ Mould, an investment director at the stockbroker AJ Bell, said: “The extra costs do knock the investment case for Lloyds as they hit return on equity, hamper the bank’s plans to build up its capital buffers and therefore its ability to distribute spare cash once regulators are satisfied that it has sufficient financial ammunition to withstand any future crisis.“The good news is that this should at least see Lloyds through PPI and that no further hits can come from it.”About 64m PPI policies were sold in the UK, mostly between 1990 and 2010. Banks and other financial institutions pushed the insurance alongside loans, credit cards and other deals – but in many cases, exclusions meant customers could never make a claim."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f29eecf112de54259ad9e33f5b953f302f6cb621/0_307_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cb5a70c84cd0202089dcb91b87a72bf7","title":"thomas pikettys new magnum opus published on thursday","story":"French economist’s Capital and Ideology expands on themes in Capital in the 21st Century, which sold 2m copies Six years after being catapulted to fame with a blockbuster about the concentration of wealth, the French economist Thomas Piketty has returned with an epic new book on capitalism.Abiding by the rule that every bestseller demands a follow-up, Capital and Ideology expands on the themes sketched out in Capital in the 21st Century, which sold 2m copies worldwide after its publication in 2013.Piketty’s new book – which runs to 1,232 pages and is as long as War and Peace – explores the ideas that have justified inequality down the ages, bemoans the ineffectiveness of the traditional parties of left and right at coming up with solutions for redistributing wealth, and advances his own ideas for making economies fairer. The book is released in France on Thursday but English language readers will have to wait until next March for the translation.Capital in the 21st Century, with its references to Jane Austen, proved to be one of the few books on economics to appeal to a mass market. It drew comparisons with John Maynard Keynes’s 1936 book, the General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money as its reputation spread during the period of weak growth that followed the financial crisis of a decade ago.But Piketty’s work has so far proved far more popular with readers than it has with governments. The General Theory was the template for the full-employment policies pursued by most western governments in the decades after the second world war, whereas Piketty’s call for a global wealth tax to counter inequality has not been heeded."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f4222963676b28499040929dee23e19431576d03/0_50_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=42e33121dddb8cba3aa47a8626478188","title":"banks have only themselves to blame for ppi reckoning","story":"Some bankers may have thought that PPI products were justified, but it was a scamWhat a suitably embarrassing end to Lloyds Banking Group’s misadventure in mis-selling PPI, or payment protection insurance. For the umpteenth time, the bank’s estimate of the cleanup bill has collided with reality and come up short.A rush of claims by punters, ahead of the August deadline, has forced a £1.2bn-£1.8bn increase in Lloyds’ provisions, taking the total to roughly £22bn. For the entire UK banking industry, the eventual tally now seems likely to land above £50bn, an astonishing sum. For good measure, the regulator’s odd Arnold Schwarzenegger adverts have helped to terminate the last £600m chunk of Lloyds’ £1.75bn share buy-back programme, the one the board was so proud of.It’s amazing now to recall that, back in 2011, when the chief executive, António Horta-Osório, commendably broke ranks with his industry’s defence of the indefensible, Lloyds reckoned it was looking a bill of a mere £3.2bn for PPI. By late-2014, the provisions had reached £10bn and the finance director confessed that getting a grip of the final figure was “fiendishly difficult”. You bet.One can point (and the banks do) to the role of claims management companies and, of course, it’s true that compensation will have been paid to some people who never had a PPI policy. But let’s not pretend that the entire £19bn increase from Lloyds’ original estimate (and comparable percentage increases at other banks) can be explained solely by fraudulent claims or ugly skim-off merchants.PPI was the most widely mis-sold product in UK financial history. It was fundamentally over-priced and various exclusions were designed to frustrate borrowers who might genuinely have benefited from cover against illness or unemployment. At some murky level, the bankers had convinced themselves that such products were justified because customers were also getting “free” in-credit banking, a deviously self-serving way to see life. PPI was a scam.To this day, you’ll find bankers who blame Horta-Osório for opening the compensation floodgates. That view is also deluded. The banks were losing their PPI legal fights in the courts and the then-new Lloyds boss was correct to conclude that a reckoning had to happen. The industry has only itself to blame.British Airways pilots tend to be a conservative bunch. They have threatened to strike many times over the years but, in the end, have always backed down and agreed a deal. Until now. What’s changed?One factor, one suspects, is the low standing of the current BA chief executive, Álex Cruz, who doesn’t command the respect his predecessors did. On Cruz’s watch, BA suffered a huge IT collapse in 2017 and an enormous data breach in 2018, for which the airline faces a £183m fine from the Information Commissioner’s Office. Both episodes looked appalling.The computer calamities were also a negotiating gift for pilots. If BA’s management prefers to maximise short-term profits, or so it must seem, why shouldn’t the people flying the planes also get a slice of the same incentive action?Cruz, interviewed on the BBC on Monday morning, was vague about the pilots’ profit-sharing demands, presumably because he doesn’t have a good response. He was paid £1.3m last year and is in no position to try high-minded arguments. The pilots are extremely well-paid by everyday standards but also seem to be performing better in the air than Cruz has been on the ground.Despite its troubles, BA made profits of £2bn-ish last year. If the pilots feel they are owed a catch-up settlement after making sacrifices in the post-2009 lean years, this is their moment to press their claims.Cruz’s media tour was, presumably, designed to lay the blame for the grounded flights on the pilots. Good luck with that: many passengers will view a strike simply as the sort of thing that happens at BA these days.The former BA chief Willie Walsh is the chief executive of the parent International Airlines Group these days and trying not to intervene. He may yet have to. Cruz sounds unconvincing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b14ad34e0eae9e136a6f8866de5cd511e7f50bc4/279_260_1699_1019/master/1699.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6561714aeecc1058df3650bc9ba4a433","title":"they call it the pitt inside edinburghs first street food market","story":" Edinburgh’s alfresco foodie haven, the Pitt Street Market, signals changing times for LeithOpen since 2015, the revitalised Pitt Street Market in the historic Leith area of Edinburgh operates every Saturday from noon till 10pm, as well as on Sundays during the summer months.Founded by Scott Kirkham (also owner of Ròst) and Hal Prescott (the Barnacles \u0026amp Bones head man), Pitt Street Market is managed by Kat Hänninen. A final-year student on the City of Glasgow College’s advertising \u0026amp PR course, Hänninen started at the Pitt in 2016 as a volunteer, and is today helping us make contact with the traders (plus she acts as an ad hoc bouncer by stopping a man leaving the market with a beer in his hand).“We never have any issues of rowdiness or anything,” says Hänninen, as she ponders over the main challenges of managing the market. “A couple of years ago, there was a drain in the yard that had a hole into which nothing could fit – except a toddler’s foot. And that’s exactly what happened once! He was a bit startled, but we managed to pull him free within a minute.”The only street food market of its kind in Scotland’s capital, Pitt Street Market’s success has led to it challenging the hegemony of the Saturday evening pub experience. “There’s a lack of beer gardens in this area specifically,” says Hänninen. “We combine food, drink and the outdoors, and that’s a big draw.”Buffalo TruckRobin Strigner trained as a chef in Wales, after he tired of the remote living involved with his previous career as a marine biologist. “I was burned out a bit and realised that maybe being a chef in the traditional sense wasn’t for me. But I still wanted to work with food,” he says.Having spent time in London observing its thriving street food scene, Strigner spotted a gap in the Scottish capital’s market. “I was scrolling through eBay one day, looking at food trucks, and spotted one that happened to be in Edinburgh already after some deliberation, I decided to go for it.”In the three years since, Strigner’s Buffalo Truck has become a staple of Pitt Street Market, with its menu including buttermilk fried chicken burgers, and truffle-parmesan fries. “Despite growing, the Pitt has managed to fully retain its soul. I come here because my friends all work here – we hang out together and go to the pub afterwards.”Buffalo Truck is one of a number of Pitt Market vendors managing their money with iZettle. “We use the card reader as it is super-convenient. The money goes straight into the bank, and the percentage they take off us is reasonable.”RòstThe Gaelic word for “roast”, Ròst is the domain of one of the Pitt’s co-founders, Scott Kirkham. A self-described “food obsessive”, when he’s not prepping and delivering produce to the Ròst stall he’s at home creating another dish, watching a cookery show or reading a food book.After being a chef and kitchen manager for 15 years, Kirkham was trading with his Ròst truck at the top of Leith Walk, but was keen to find a more stable location. “I was storing my trailer in the yard at Pitt Street and I kept driving away thinking: ‘Why don’t we just try here?’”A popular spot each week at the Pitt, Ròst delivers a menu featuring peanut butter crunch pheasant burgers and halloumi bao buns. It seems as though Kirkham never switches off. “Whenever I’m away on holiday, the food is the first thing I’ll check out,” he says.Barnacles \u0026amp BonesWith the Barnacles \u0026amp Bones boss away doing culinary business at an electronic music festival, James Wright holds the fort. When you ask him about the particular challenges on working at this truck, he simply shows off his arm, where a three-week-old burn is slowly healing. “Something accidentally fell into the fryer and hot oil splashed out,” he recalls. “I didn’t rush to hospital as I was far too busy just wrapped it with clingfilm and the adrenaline rush kept me going.”As suggested by the name, this truck lays on fish and meat options, including crab ‘n’ fries, and meatballs. Running the stall makes for busy work for Wright, who is keen to focus on his food without worrying about payments admin. He also uses iZettle: “It’s so handy being able to use cards in different, obscure places. You just need good internet and you’re ready to go.“My main challenge is keeping the barbecue stocked up, always making sure we have enough of the produce. We all know each other, so we can often pop in and borrow things from each other’s stalls.”Stooge BurgerMark Harrison-Hand likes his food spicy. “I started off doing noodles, ramen and curries,” he says. “I’ve been known to put too much chilli in, but people need to man up! It’s good for you.” Stooge Burger has been up and running for about a year, and Harrison-Hand knows when to mix it up and when to leave things be. “Burgers are always going to be a big seller, so we thought we shouldn’t do anything fancy with the burger mix, which is good Scottish beef.”Harrison-Hand got the serious foodie bug when he was travelling around Asia and took some cookery lessons. “It was mainly so I could cook for myself, but when I was later working in hospitality I made my way from front-of-house back into the kitchen.”He is a fan of Leith and sees the area and the market as an ideal fit. “It’s nice being away from town and in a place where you get a good mix of people.”Tim Vincent-SmithPianodrome duo Tim Vincent-Smith and Matt Wright, part of today’s entertainment, are so impressed with the Pitt Street Market atmosphere that they’re returning in August to perform a Fringe show – in an amphitheatre entirely made out of upcycled pianos. “Lovely food, lovely beer, lovely vibe and 10,000 followers on Facebook. In one way, it might not be in the centre of town, so might not bring a festival crowd, but in another way, well, who cares? The people who would want to find out about us will find out,” says Vincent-Smith.Jenni McCandlessJenni: “I found out about it through a friend when it just had this courtyard bit. We’ll be here for a few hours and get some food in a bit.”Mark Vigers“I worked for Barnacles \u0026amp Bones two or three years ago and have been a frequent visitor ever since. I love the community vibe, good music, good food, good beer, and it’s outside.”Lauren and Steven Rackley (and Murray the dog)Lauren: “We’re new to Edinburgh and I only heard about the Pitt through a girl at work. This is our first time here, and we’re always looking for dog-friendly places, so we brought him along and it’s amazing.”Steven: “I’ve messaged some of our friends to ask them to come along, as it’s a fantastic way to spend an afternoon.”Discover what iZettle can do for your business at izettle"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5a1b0dc6ee8f4dec5af258c787b953c417af5049/0_66_1733_1040/master/1733.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=818739c85203c89addfad8b8c84dce54","title":"learn what people want 10 tips on how to create a successful vintage fashion business","story":"Flea markets are a favourite weekend pastime for many. Here’s how to turn your passion for fashion into a bustling market stallIf your ideal weekend is spent hitting up car boot sales, browsing charity shops and scouring Etsy for the perfect vintage find, then having your own stall may seem like the dream job – or at least the dream side hustle. But what are the tips and tricks to make your vintage fashion business a success? We asked successful stall owners how they went from vintage fan to thriving market trader – and how you can do the same.1. Start small“Don’t get carried away and invest a lot of money at the start,” says Amanda Barnes, whose shop Ooh La La Vintage in Dorset began as a stall at events and vintage festivals. “Keep expectations realistic and reassess every few months before you buy more stock. Even if you’re just doing it as a hobby, it’s a good idea to write a loose business plan. Decide how much you’ll spend on stock, and think about other expenses, such as travel and the cost of the pitch. Then work out how much you need to sell to recoup costs and turn a profit.”2. Follow your passion“Think about your current vintage collection and whether there’s a theme that stands out, because that’s what you should focus on,” says Sarah Horrillo, who started her Portobello Road stall London Vintage six years ago. “When I first started out, I did a lot of vintage table linens and homeware now I just focus on women’s clothes. But your passion might be accessories or childrenswear or denim or ’50s clothes. As you build up your business, people will come to associate you with a particular theme.”3. Build a brand“From the outset, think about who you’re trying to reach and what you’re offering,” says Kerry Norton, a part-time nurse who also runs Sisters of the Moon, a vintage stall in London and Brighton. “Get a logo and business cards, so that if a customer doesn’t buy anything that day, they can go away and find you. Get an Instagram account – it’s a really important way to build up a following – and pay attention to analytics. If a particular item is getting lots of likes, you’ll know to look out for similar pieces.”4. Go contactless“I set myself up with iZettle straight away,” says Norton. “Loads of people don’t carry cash and people want contactless payments, which makes things so much easier and quicker and less hassle than rummaging around for change. It’s also a good idea to have a separate bank account for your stall, so you can keep track of incomings and outgoings.”5. Always be on the hunt“The hardest part of the job is finding the right pieces – and no one wants to reveal their sources,” says Norton. “Some traders use wholesalers, but my stock is all inidually sourced. Always keep your eye out wherever you go, and be willing to do repairs.” Horrillo takes an empty suitcase when she goes on holiday, as she says she never knows where she might find a gem. “The best advice I can give is to only buy things you love. Don’t be swayed by a designer label, or overthink it and buy something because you think it will sell – that never works.”6. It’s good to talk“Chatting to your customers is a great way to learn what people want,” says Barnes. “That’s your market, so it’s a great way to get instant feedback on what you’re doing. Do they want things in bigger sizes? Are they looking for better quality? Are they finding items too expensive? Take it all on board and adapt your strategy accordingly.”7. Get friendlyTeaming up with a friend who also loves vintage fashion can be a good way to split pitch costs and make selling more fun. “It’s also a good idea to make friends with fellow stall owners,” says Jean Thompson of Love Vintage, based in Leeds. “They can watch the stall for you when you’re having a break, and will often have loads of great advice if they’ve been doing it for years. There’s a really nice community of vintage traders and we all help each other out.”8. Presentation is key“Take the time to make sure your items are nicely presented, ironed, clean and clearly priced,” says Barnes. “Make sure all of a garment’s seams, buttons and fastenings are intact, too. People want to immediately incorporate an item into their wardrobe – they don’t want to take it home and spend time repairing it.”9. Get organised“Try to lay out your stock in an orderly way,” says Thompson. “That also makes it easier to keep track of your current inventory, and pull out similar pieces when they do sell.” Norton suggests thinking about how you’ll transport your stock and where you’ll put it when you’re not on the stall. “I had a year of keeping all my stock in my tiny flat, but now I use a storage facility,” she says. “It’s a hidden cost that I didn’t think about at the start, but for me it’s well worth it.”10. Accept the ups and downs“You can have long quiet periods, and that’s scary,” says Norton. “But you have to think on a monthly basis rather than having a bad day and then feeling despondent. If you do have an unsuccessful selling day, try to think about what you can learn from it – maybe it wasn’t the right location for you, for example. Ultimately, I’m doing something I enjoy and, for me, that’s much more rewarding than a regular paycheck.”To find out how iZettle can help your business, visit izettle"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/75b45e52390c8fb15ccda115992051ad9f933609/0_0_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b2ffeb87bc139114bb183083ba2d6454","title":"the guardian view on pope francis a voice in the wilderness","story":"Pope Francis has been visiting two of the poorest countries in the world, but on the way he took a moment to attack his enemies in the richest. Handed a book by the French journalist Nicolas Senèze, which recounts the efforts of a rightwing American clique to force him out of office, he described it as “a bomb”, and said that it was “an honour when the Americans attack me”. There was no mistaking the depth of the split within the world’s largest and most important Christian church.In the developed world, and especially in Europe and North America, organised Christianity is collapsing, particularly among the young. This is as true of the Catholic church as of any other. In this country its numbers are maintained by immigration, and its morale, at least in part, by a policy of avoiding largely empty churches by using only enough to keep them full in the US, lapsed Catholics are numbered in tens of millions. In all these countries, religious affiliation falls with every generation and there is no end to the process in sight.The response of the clergy and the most engaged laity has been a frenzy of self-blame. In Germany, France and the US, the church has been ided into liberal and conservative parties, each of whom blames the other’s doctrines for both the decline in numbers in general and the clerical abuse scandal in particular. The resignation of Pope Benedict XVI has added to the strains on the church. It is the first time since the 14th century that there have been two popes living. No matter how little Benedict may wish to ide the authority of his former office, he has become a focus of discontent for conservatives. The Italian far-right politician Matteo Salvini has posed with a T-shirt that says “My Pope is Benedict” as part of his campaign against immigration. This is part of a wider pattern in which Catholicism is reimagined as a guarantor of European identity against Islam.That line has been pushed by Donald Trump’s former adviser, Steve Bannon, who tried to weld together rightwing politicians and theological conservatives within the Catholic church. This year, though, the alliance has frayed, since the conservative clergy, with very few exceptions, see the real enemy as secularism rather than Islam – and in international gatherings, the Catholic church has allied itself with Muslim conservatives against reproductive rights for women. Cardinal Raymond Burke, who has accused the pope of heresy, resigned from Bannon’s Italian institute where future leaders of the alt-right were to be educated.Pope Francis remains determined to reorient the church towards the global south, where it is still growing at impressive rates, especially in Africa, and to place it on the side of the poor. In Mozambique and Madagascar, he has argued for reconciliation between competing factions. In Mauritius, he has denounced the use of the islands as a tax haven, calling it “an idolatrous economic model”, and appealed to the government to “promote an economic policy focused on people and in a position to favour a better ision of income”. However little the church seems to matter in the developed world, there is no spiritual leader making these arguments against unrestrained capitalism and environmental destruction as forcefully and to such an audience as Francis does in the global south today."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8bf7ec2f420f7feb6da36f30aad165cdf576afaa/0_0_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=983c3bf465f5e7d59af8be1cdc3d89cf","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of rugged","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘rugged’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘rugged’.Share your photos of what rugged means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 11 September at 10am.

On its final breath, the dragon turned to wood and laid down roots to become a tree.In reality, the tree’s unusual shape is a result of having been blown down in a storm, after which it re-rooted, with the existing branches twisting to accommodate the new structure.Another “phoenix” tree is the Fallen Tree in Richmond Park in south-west London. It, too, was blown over by high winds, but rose again. Its branches now grow all from the upward side of its trunk, each one reaching to the sky like a small tree in itself.The other trees on the 10-strong shortlist may lack such mythical connections, but still give insights into the country’s heritage. Britain’s yew forests, thousands of years old and once prized for military reasons, as the supple wood was used to make longbows, have disappeared from all but a handful of places. One is the Kingley Vale on the South Downs, where the forest’s Great Yew has huge arching branches that form a large canopy.Oaks were treasured in England’s forests for another military reason, as they were used to build the ships that gave Britain naval dominance for centuries. Few oaks are now being planted, leading foresters to warn of upcoming shortages and the need for imports, but their national importance is reflected in their position on this year’s shortlist: six of the 10 trees listed are oaks.The Allerton Oak in Liverpool is believed to have been the site of the local court in medieval times. The large crack down the side of the tree is said to have come from the explosion of the Lottie Sleigh, a ship carrying 11 tonnes of gunpowder to the local docks.Addison’s Oak in Bristol has a more recent origin: it was planted in 1919 when the MP Christopher Addison launched a city-wide housing scheme to build “homes fit for heroes”, for soldiers returning from the first world war.Addison was behind the Housing and Town Planning Act, which led to building of the UK’s first council houses. As minister for health and an eminent doctor, he recognised that the squalor and slums ordinary people lived in were a prime factor in their poor health and wanted social housing and council planners to provide opportunities for green surroundings, light and fresh air.Though the government has pledged millions of new trees, targets are not being met. Adam Cormack, the head of campaigning at the Woodland Trust, which runs the annual competition, urged people to value woodlands.“Trees across the country are constantly under threat of felling due to inappropriate developments. The competition is all about helping to rise the profile of trees in order to offer them better protection,” he said.Voting is now open and closes at noon on 27 September. Last year, more than 15,500 people voted for their favourite tree."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7c419e9a2c99013c64604a3d793ad8285c3670eb/12_0_4430_2658/master/4430.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=17b7e0673523ce67c1ac3778cb4df853","title":"englands tree of the year 2019 the woodland trust shortlist","story":"The Woodland Trust’s annual competition highlights and celebrates the best trees in the country.

Pussybows and flares were in full swing, as were silver hoop earrings the circumference of saucers. There were black and white spots peppered over silk blouses, scarves and cowl-neck dresses with thigh-high slits. Hats appeared many guises, from the wide-brimmed one worn by the Ashley Graham to Winnie Harlow’s black and white houndstooth print baker boy-style cap.Velvet, leather, leopard print and faux snakeskin came in black, white and deep burgundies, choreographed into coordinated outfits. In the second part of the show, the clothes – and the moves – turned up the volume with metallic flares, dresses, halter-neck jumpsuits and suits.In notes that Hilfiger sent to guests before the show, the collaboration was described as putting “redefined power dressing at its core”. The designer explained further: “We wanted to celebrate and champion female empowerment through fashion.”The musical heritage of the Apollo, which has hosted shows by Billie Holiday, Lauryn Hill and Otis Redding, played into the brand’s long-term relationship with music. It was hip-hop culture that helped Hilfiger achieve international success.The brand saw the show as a homecoming. For the past three years, since adopting the see-now, buy-now model, which cuts the time customers have to wait to buy clothes from six months to seconds, it has been on a #TommyNow worldwide tour, Zendaya picking up the baton after the supermodel Gigi Hadid’s four-collection collaboration.The business model seems to be making sense commercially. Although cashing in on instant gratification, as many brands are now opting to do, could be seen as a controversial move at a time when consumers are being encouraged to make their fashion choices more conscious and sustainable.The show fits with the current emphasis on experience over the static catwalk mould: a cinematic set was made to look like a block party, complete with brownstone steps, parked classic cars and snatches of city life, from sirens to rattling trains, made into an opening soundtrack.But it was far from pedestrian – saxophonists, drummers and trumpeters were on hand to play live and models largely gave up on walking, instead dancing their way down the catwalk to tracks such as Aretha Franklin’s Respect, Bobby Womack’s Across 110th Street and Curtis Mayfield’s Move on Up.It was a spectacle made to appeal to media-savvy millennials for whom, research states, experience is valued over “stuff”. With Hadid, Hilfiger put on two mammoth fashion shows, one a “rock circus” at the Roundhouse performance space in north London, the other a fairground in Los Angeles.Collaborations with pop culture icons are also a smart move. “They have always been an important part of our heritage,” said Hilfiger. “Each collaborator sees our brand through a different lens which allows us to translate our values in new and exciting ways.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/944fc3afa4c2fa59158bfda5b6a4dd9a10898cdc/0_37_2835_1701/master/2835.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d0fab66cdfd412039a5c3abc4a7d8ef2","title":"mark rylance satan terrence malick geza rohrig matthias schoenaerts the last planet","story":"Son of Saul’s Géza Röhrig will be Jesus and Matthias Schoenaerts St Peter in forthcoming Christ drama The Last PlanetThe cast of Terrence Malick’s life of Christ film has been revealed, with Son of Saul star Géza Röhrig taking the leading role.Röhrig will play Jesus in The Last Planet, which will tell the story of Christ’s life through a series of parables. Matthias Schoenaerts, who features in Malick’s most recent film, A Hidden Life, will portray St Peter, while Mark Rylance is Satan.Speaking at the Deauville film festival, Rylance said production on his scenes would begin in October, and that he would be playing multiple versions of Beelzebub.“Terry wrote four versions of the character of Satan,” he said, “and I thought I would play only one. But I heard I was going to play all four. One of them must have been a woman at some point, but it was when he asked me to grow a beard that I realised I wasn’t going to do it that way.“I’m very happy to act for Terrence Malick, but I’m intrigued, because I hear he talks to you all the time.

Just as it seemed Northern Ireland would lead, their goalkeeper keeps them in it to prevent Germany from stealing the lead. Jamal Lewis switched off and Klostermann laid the ball on a plate for Werner but Peacock-Farrell saves with his legs. A crucial stop by the Burnley goalkeeper, who joined from Leeds in the summer.45 min: Somehow Germany survive! Neuer eventually smothers the ball! After a neat one-two between Dallas and Corry Evans, the latter sends a rasping cross into the front post from the right flank. Jonathan Tah is first on the scene, ing in to make life difficult for Conor Washington, who simply does not react quick enough. Neuer gets a second bite of the cherry, and this time the Germany goalkeeper clutches it. Germany are quick on the counter ...42 min: Toni Kroos and George Saville get in to a brief shouting match – but that’s that. It all stemmed from Paddy McNair leaving a bit on Kroos, with the referee booking the midfielder for standing on the Real Madrid man. Meanwhile, a change: Jonathan Tah is on to replace the injured Mathias Ginter.38 min: Thomas Meunier fires against the side netting! More magic from Kevin de Bruyne, who slips in a cute ball to the back stick. In Belfast, Northern Ireland keep plugging away, with Steven Davis, Corry Evans and co chasing every loose ball and lost cause. It’s absolutely bouncing in the stands.It had been coming – and make that three assists for the majestic Kevin de Bruyne. It is the first time since 1979 that Scotland have conceded three first-half goals on home soil, also against Belgium. Steve Clarke’s stoney face tells a thousand words. The atmosphere is desperately flat at Hampden, in stark contrast to Windsor Park, where Northern Ireland supporters are cheering every tackle with great gusto. Germany have been in the ascendency, though.31 min: A couple of near-misses! At Hampden, Youri Tielemans drops a shot inches wide of a post. In Cardiff, Kieffer Moore almost helps himself to a goal on his debut but Belarus nip in to prevent the Wigan striker from doubling Wales’s lead. 29 min: Cathcart nods clear as Germany attempt to find Brandt. Northern Ireland are having to sustain a hefty spell of pressure. Elsewhere, Ryan Babel’s goal has given the Netherlands the lead in Estonia, while Macedonia lead Latvia 2-0.Ah, drat. De Bruyne tees up Thomas Vermaelen. It is another peach of an assist by the Manchester City midfielder collects a short corner and promptly fires a wonderful whipped ball in towards the back post, where Belgium are queuing up. Vermaelen simply side-foots home into the roof David Marshall’s goal.21 min: Northern Ireland appear to get away with one, as Julian Brandt’s strike hits Jonny Evans left hand inside the box. Evans shrieked in fear and Germany are up in arms about it but the hosts get off the hook. A heroic block by George Saville leads to the Middlesbrough midfielder needing some treatment but he’s soon back up on his feet. Joachim Löw’s side are certainly growing into the game, with his side beginning to stretch Northern Ireland and make them work a little harder defensively.Another beauty by the Manchester United winger. A wry Gareth Bale smile says it all. Once again, the 21-year-old jinks in from the left on to his right foot and finds the corner. James is a man in form, that his fourth goal in six games this season.18 min: Jonny Evans dallies on possession on halfway and Timo Werner robs the centre-back and storms forward. Werner looks up and tries to pick out Serge Gnabry but Craig Cathcart bails out his team-mate and wellies the ball clear. The resulting corner comes to nothing as Cathcart hoofs clear once more. Northern Ireland are more than holding their own against Germany on home turf.17 min: Lukaku has bagged 32 goals for Belgium since August 2016. What’s more, he has scored four goals in his three international appearances against Scotland, finding the net with four of his five shots on target. Not bad going, eh? Scotland appear to have dusted themselves down, with Robert Snodgrass curling in a dangerous ball but it’s comfortably cleared by Toby Alderweireld.12 min: Manuel Neuer has been much the busier goalkeeper in Belfast, with a McNair free-kick forcing the Bayern Munich man to punch clear. In Scotland, they need to recover from an early setback. It was a killer counterattack by Belgium, just as their manager predicted. De Bruyne is released down the left flank and he runs and runs before picking out Lukaku at the opportune moment. The rest is history as Lukaku – first time – finds the net.6 min: Neuer denies Washington! Toni Kroos is harried superbly by Corry Evans, who blocks the midfielder’s attempted pass, which cannons into the striker’s path. Washington is inadvertently released one v one but the Germany goalkeeper is quick off his line and makes a strong left-handed save. His giant frame makes life difficult for the striker, whose effort was swiftly repelled. Germany go up the other end through Timo Werner but he fluffs his lines.5 min: Conor Washington stabs the ball goalwards, which is enough to earn a big, hearty gasp from the Northern Ireland supporters. It stemmed from Stuart Dallas’s long throw from the right flank causing a bit of mayhem in the Germany 18-yard box and Washington endeavoured to keep it alive. No real scare for Manuel Neuer, but something for the hosts to take plenty of confidence from nevertheless.3 min: Windsor Park is absolutely rocking. Paddy McNair wins an early corner but Germany wallop the ball clear. Jonny Evans earlier halted a Germany attack almost direct from kick-off. The Scots have started quickly at Hampden, with the kind of tempo that will please Steve Clarke and those supporters alike.And, just like that, we’re off. At Hampden, Manchester City again get the better of Liverpool, with Kevin de Bruyne wining the coin toss against Andy Robertson.The teams trudge out of the tunnel at Hampden Park, and likewise in Belfast, Cardiff and ... Hull, where England Under-21s are in action. We are just the national anthems away from the off. Ooh, and a gentle reminder that the former Scotland forward Shaun Maloney is on Roberto Martínez’s backroom staff. “As a player I loved the Scotland national anthem and lining up for it — I still do,” Maloney, who was capped 47 times by his country, said. “But it is about staying focused and appreciating I am being paid for a certain job. I am working for Belgium so I think you have to respect both, but I do especially have to remember I am here to work.”Martínez has also been gushing about Romelu Lukaku before kick-off – and with good reason: no player has scored more international goals for their country than the 31 he has managed since August 2016, dwarfing the tallies of Cristiano Ronaldo, Robert Lewandowski and Harry Kane, among others. Of the Inter forward, his manager says: “At the age of 26, to have that amount of goals at international level and club level shows you how good a goalscorer he is. He brings something a little bit different, he can use the pace and power to bring a different physicality to his play. It’s important he’s back and fully fit to start the season.”Fresh from a pre-match cuppa, Michael O’Neill says he has tried to inject as much vim into his team as possible. There is certainly legs in his side, with Jamal Lewis, whose mother is an athletics coach, a talented cross-country and 800m runner in his teens, while Steven Davis, Paddy McNair and George Saville offer no end of midfield bite. “We’ve tried to put as much pace in the team as we can – Stuart Dallas has been playing at right-back for Leeds all season,” he says. “We expect Germany to have a back four. We have to match them, the key in this game is to stay in the game for as long as possible. We have to play our own game and hurt them.”Recap last night’s scores on the doors:Steve Clarke suggested he would freshen things up, and the Scotland manager has done just that. McGinn, who scored on Friday, James Forrest, Fraser and McBurnie all drop out, with Matt Phillips, Ryan Christie, Kenny McLean and Robert Snodgrass all coming into the starting lineup. Christie has scored eight goals this season, though none since 13 August and Phillips has scored a couple of times for West Bromwich Albion in the Championship. Belgium, meanwhile, boast Romelu Lukaku and Kevin de Bruyne, with Origi and Batshuayi among those on the bench.Team news news: Oli McBurnie, John McGinn and Ryan Fraser are among those to drop out for Scotland, as Steve Clarke makes four changes, replacing his entire frontline from the defeat at home to Russia. That seems quite a ballsy move. No Hazards for Belgium, with Thorgan and Eden both injured. Northern Ireland make eight changes from their friendly win, with Jamal Lewis among those to start, while Germany name the same XI that were soundly beaten by the Netherlands in Hamburg. In Wales, Gareth Bale is on the bench as Ryan Giggs hands debuts to Kieffer Moore, the former Truro City striker, and Joe Morrell, the Bristol City midfielder on loan at Lincoln City. In terms of England Under-21s, Aidy Boothroyd sticks with Eddie Nketiah and Reiss Nelson, who did the damage in Turkey last week. Ben Godfrey replaces Monaco’s Jonathan Panzo in England’s only change.Northern Ireland top Group C after taking maximum points from their opening four matches and are yet to taste defeat this year, though the reality is they have not faced opposition as formidable as Germany since November. Under Michael O’Neill, they have made a habit of making life difficult and inflicting the odd upset or two, making light work of Norway and Czech Republic since reaching the round of 16 at the last Euros. Also in action are Scotland, where the mood is considerably gloomier given Steve Clarke’s side have the unenviable task of entertaining, according to the Fifa rankings, the best nation on the planet. The grimmer news for Scotland? Belgium have won their past five meetings without conceding a goal. “We have to be defensively organised, but you also have to have a threat,” Clarke said. “There’s no point thinking we can camp down for 97 minutes.”Avoiding defeat at Windsor Park would go some way to helping Northern Ireland secure a qualification spot ahead of the Netherlands, who overcame Joachim Löw’s side last time out. “We are in a group of three with Holland and Germany, which is a nice play to be,” said O’Neill. A bout of flu has bogged down some of the German camp, with Ilkay Gündogan among those missing for what, on the face of it, is an intriguing tie. “Northern Ireland are amazingly robust, they play a lot of long balls,” Löw said. “They will sit deeper and we will not have much space, so we need to think of something tactically.” The captain, Manuel Neuer, added: “It is not ideal for us to be playing an away game in Belfast right now. They have won all their games so far and it is always difficult to score goals against such opponents.” So, is there any stopping this Northern Ireland side? We will soon find out.

Is he on to something?They say love is a numbers game. Bobby Seagull – the mathematician who rose to fame as a finalist on University Challenge in 2017 – took them literally.A few years ago, he sat down to try to work out why he had been so unlucky in life. “I was 32 or 33, I was single, I loved maths and science – I thought: ‘Can I use maths and science to help me?’ It was a genuine, earnest attempt.”Inspired by Peter Backus – a Manchester University economics lecturer who in 2010 wrote a paper titled Why I Don’t Have a Girlfriend – Seagull used the Drake equation, developed to estimate how many intelligent alien civilisations there might be in the galaxy, to determine his number of potential partners. “You start by assuming there’s infinitely many, then you keep on making the pool smaller and smaller.”From the total female populations of London and Cambridge – the cities between which he split his time – Seagull selected those roughly his age and up to 10 years younger. Then he reduced that group to the proportion that were likely to be university educated, to reflect the reality of his networks, as a school maths teacher and doctorate student.Then came a harder parameter: what fraction Seagull might find attractive. After going through his Facebook friends list, he found 1,200 women who met his criteria for age, location and education – and of one in every 20, he says he thought that he “could imagine us, in another life”.That left Seagull with 29,369 potential girlfriends: as he puts it, a decent-sized crowd at the old West Ham ground at Upton Park. But that did not account for two important factors: his next girlfriend would have to be single – and she would have to find him attractive, too.Seagull found himself with a final total of 73. Whether that figure floods you with optimism or despair may mark you out as a romantic or a realist. On one hand, it’s nowhere close to filling up a football stadium. On the other, it is significantly greater than one. As in, the One.Numbers have long factored into the dating game, even for those who have a ropey grasp on them. We might wonder, of a couple’s particularly serendipitous origin story: “What are the chances?” Or we might console someone who is unhappily single that “it only takes one”.Online dating has strengthened mathematics’ role in the search for love, not only in serving up seemingly infinite potential partners, but in using algorithms to sift through them. As it is increasingly accepted that there is no perfect one for each of us, the numbers are on our side – but that doesn’t mean the search is easy.“I think there are many ‘ones’,” says Seagull. “There are 107 billion people who have ever existed – if you really think there is one person who is truly your ‘one’, they’ve probably died.”Now 35 and still single, Seagull has continued his investigation into “making the maths of love work for you” in his book, The Life-Changing Magic of Numbers, as well as on dates. When he had reached that 73 figure, he says, he showed his working to his mum as a somewhat tongue-in-cheek rebuttal to her persistent inquiries as to why he didn’t have a girlfriend.“The reality is, that’s on paper – it doesn’t tell you whether you’re compatible in person. On paper, I’m probably a perfect match with my dad, if he was a woman, and not related to me.“And that’s 73 people that I think would be a perfect fit for me – I may not be a perfect fit for them.”Perhaps understandably, on being confronted by a pool of potential partners who could fit comfortably on one double-decker bus, Seagull says he has learned the need to relax his criteria. After all, he says, the mathematician Hannah Fry found that the most successful couples have a “low negativity threshold”, meaning they argue often but easily move on. “Then you’ve got to start thinking: what’s the most efficient way of dating people so that you can quickly establish their potential?”Seagull supports a “little bit of stress-testing” even at the dating stage his suggestion is to bring up Brexit, less to weed out leave or remain voters than to test a potential partner’s capacity for disagreement. (Excluding leave voters would further reduce his pool from 73 to about 40, he says, sounding dismayed.)Like the Drake equation, online dating can present you only with a pool of suitable partners you could potentially meet. Attraction must be assessed in person, “and there is no formula for that”, says Seagull. Or at least not yet, he adds he is confident that machine-learning technology will eventually be able “to read your mood, your mind … and detect bits of our personality” to predict the presence of that elusive spark.In decades to come, it may even be possible to simulate dates the same way that it is football matches now, modelling every variable – although, Seagull says, probably not soon enough to be of any use to him.For now, the most efficient approach to dating is to meet as many potential partners as possible – and apps connect us with a seemingly infinite number. There can often be an element of the paradox of choice: sure, this match seems good, but what if an even better one is a swipe away?“You don’t know at what stage in these 500 dates you will meet your most suited person, and you’re probably going to miss them – but mathematically, this is how you can settle better.“This is where you really need to trust the maths – you might think that the first person you meet is amazing, but you’ve got to get through the first 185. If we simulated our lives a million times, the person that you would date best would still be after 185.”Keeping track of that number would inevitably necessitate a spreadsheet, or at least note-taking, which even Seagull sees as a step too far: “I haven’t got that cynical yet.”The key to bear in mind, he says, is that “once you’ve got your potential pool, you need to maximise your chances by meeting as many of them as quickly as possible” – before they get coupled up, leave the country or otherwise remove themselves.There is evidence to support coming to a conclusion about potential partners quickly – even if by gut feeling alone. In 2012, the US mathematician Chris McKinlay successfully hacked dating site OkCupid to identify his best matches, then – through trial and error – perfected his own formula for dates: no alcohol a definite endpoint – no trailing off and no concerts, films or anything similarly “inefficient”, as he told Wired’s Kevin Poulsen.Once, he took different dates to the same beach, on the same day. It worked for McKinlay (and his fiancee found the story amusing), but Seagull says he has had the opposite approach, being “very strict about the swipe process” and less disciplined about the actual dates.He intends to take a leaf from McKinlay’s workbook and relax his criteria, have more and shorter dates – and to avoid alcohol. “You can’t have things that cloud your data set.” But Seagull shies from McKinlay’s tactic of sending the same, boilerplate message to matches he wanted to meet (“You seem really cool. Want to meet?”).“The thing about maths is, it can make you feel a bit cynical sometimes when you’re on dates, going through their personality traits. I think it should be a guidance. Maths can’t take into account every single possible factor.” Such as, for example, human emotions – although those don’t always make dating easier, either, says Seagull.I am surprised to learn that he has only been on seven or eight dates since doing Drake’s equation a few years ago. Maybe his mum was right when, on seeing his formula, she told him he was being ridiculous, and “to go out and meet people”.“I’m terrible,” he admits. “I leave a long gap between dates. After a date, if you didn’t have a good time, you feel despondent. I had another date, where I liked her and she didn’t like me. As a human, you get upset. That’s why scientists trust the maths: keep going.”Bobby Seagull will present his Mathematician’s Guide to Dating at New Scientist Live, ExCel London, on 11 October"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/06c493c7cdc07e307671d58513abed1f35214a16/0_0_6492_3895/master/6492.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=abdb4e31884242d078ecb4bfe7acfbdb","title":"a ruthless approach to decluttering completely transformed my life","story":"Since watching an episode of Marie Kondo’s TV show, I have overhauled our family home – and reaped mental, financial and professional rewardsWhen I moved in with my husband, we found ourselves with two of everything. We sold furniture and donated kitchen utensils to charity. But, having lived alone, parting with more sentimental items was difficult. And, as I later discovered, my husband is a bit of a hoarder. He couldn’t ditch his MDF TV cabinet I was too attached to my impractical 50s Danish tub sofa.Things got worse after we had children. With the arrival of countless toys, books and kids’ clothes, it got out of hand.I am an introvert who loves being at home, but, as a freelance writer, our house is also my office, so I need clarity and a certain amount of organisation to function. The clutter made me anxious.My husband feels none of this. He can walk past a pile of clothes, a collection of empty toilet rolls, row upon row of shoes, and settle himself in front of the TV for the evening. I needed to restore order, but the immensity of the job and my desire to succeed, combined with the chaos inflicted by three small boys, left me feeling like Wile E Coyote. The problem felt insurmountable.That was until I caught an episode of Tidying Up With Marie Kondo. Kondo is the queen of the cull, instructing her devotees to look at their stuff and ask: “Does it spark joy?” Her clear instructions meant I didn’t have to press my tired mind for strategies. I had put the show on in the background, but Kondo was so convincing that even my husband was onboard within 15 minutes.We were going to have to be ruthless in our mission to declutter. The house was permanently littered with toys, so we started by giving away anything that was ignored or had been outgrown. Sure, I had to smuggle the toys out after bedtime, but getting rid of things meant the boys played better with what they had. What remained was split into two groups: our staples of books, Lego and art supplies stayed close to hand, while the rest was stored in the loft and brought out on rotation.Next, I pared down my wardrobe. Having worked in TV, I had a lot of bright, beautiful clothes that I had been holding on to in the hope of reliving those days. With motherhood came acceptance. Everything had to go except for black jeans, black dresses and a few scarves to add colour. I ditched all the Pakistani outfits I had kept for rare formal functions, keeping only my saris they never go out of fashion.Moving from the north of England to London meant becoming more reliant on public transport, so heels are now obsolete. A pair of black biker boots, some black trainers and my flip-flops carry me through the year. Everything else went on eBay or to the charity shop. Kitchen gadgets have left the building. I have zero time to make spring rolls or samosas. I accept that I will never use a food processor. The demands on my time outweigh any desire to make culinary creations that can be procured elsewhere.The time I invested in decluttering was recouped quickly. The process made my mind clearer, and the time I spent with my boys less fraught. As well as reducing my anxiety levels and making everything easier to find, decluttering had some surprising side-effects. During the process, I had asked my five-year-old to help fold his clothes. Together, we had gazed adoringly at his newly organised wardrobe and drawers. The next morning, as I was making breakfast and packing lunches, he came downstairs fully dressed, having done it himself for the first time. The project had given him a sense of control and instilled in him responsibility for his own clothes.Personally, I no longer wasted valuable minutes deciding what to wear. The black clothing hides a multitude of sins, too, so I also worried less about my weight.Another unexpected impact of decluttering has been financial we buy a lot less. A wander round TK Maxx no longer results in surprise acquisitions. Those beautiful sticky notes, the extra Le Creuset jar that will languish in the back of a cupboard, yet another unnecessary mirror – they don’t find their way into our house. In fact, we rarely go shopping. We know what we need, so we buy it online.Of course, with growing children and a hoarder husband, this is a work in progress. I dread the various packages that appear in the post as a result of his love of new stuff, but they are few and far between now that he has seen the benefits of owning less. As for me, our more minimal life has helped my work to flourish. Eight months into our orderly regime, I am better organised and have more time and less mental load, which means I have more brain space for creativity. Life looks set to get busier and there will be less time to declutter, but I am determined never to let things get out of hand again."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f988a78b1af00ba13b90bec66cb9af0db4885939/98_52_616_369/master/616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6100742fb7b6c70141b7399ec71ac9b6","title":"how we met he said we could just get married i said oh yeah cool","story":"The first time Carmena saw James, she knew he was the man she was going to marry. They were at an intensive two-month yoga course in Australia – Carmena was 28 and from New Zealand, and James, 45, was from the US – and she spotted him on the first day by the door of the yoga studio. “He was sitting down, he had this awesome chest, dreadlocks, and I saw immediately he had such a beautiful warmth to his eyes,” she says. A psychic had told her that she would meet her husband before her 29th birthday. “I saw him and I thought: ‘That’s the guy!’ I was in total disbelief,” she says. “I was terrified, actually. I was like: ‘What happens if he rejects me?’” She turns to him. “After class, you came up to me.”“I think you came up to me,” says James. “We both have tattoos, so we started talking about them.”The group’s routine was to rise at 2am to practise yoga until 8am, then have a nap, breakfast, “then do whatever you want,” James recalls. After about two weeks, a few of them arranged to go out for dinner, but only James and Carmena turned up. Afterwards, they had a moonlit walk on the beach, then – rather less romantically – kissed for the first time by a “garishly lit” service station before going their separate ways to their accommodation.Did James feel that same instant connection? “A bit. Something happened the first time we were together. I felt that this was a very special person and this wasn’t to be taken lightly, this moment.”When James’s visa ran out three months later and he returned to the US, they planned to continue the relationship long-distance but it was a wrench. “It’s funny because I’ve always been very detached around romantic feelings, but this was so all-encompassing,” says Carmena. “I cried for, like, six weeks, and we were calling each other every day.”An immigration official told James it would make everything easier if they got married. “We had the oddest proposal ever, right?” he says. Carmena smiles. “James said: ‘We could probably just get married.’ I said: ‘Oh yeah, cool.’ We were very cool about it but then I hung up and I started going: ‘Oh my God, he asked me to marry him.’ I was running round the house, like: ‘I can’t believe it.’”Neither had been looking for a partner when they met. “It was a total surprise,” says Carmena. “I had just come out of a really dysfunctional relationship, which reaffirmed all the reasons why I didn’t want to be in a relationship. Even when I met the psychic, I was like: ‘Oh yeah, right.’ I totally brushed it off and I didn’t even remember her words until I saw James.” What did James think when she told him, shortly after their wedding, about the prediction? He laughs. “I’d been around a lot of yoga people, so I just kind of went with it.”Want to share your story?

Instead, she credits her new glow to a movement that has lurked in corners of the internet for several years.Kristel is a follower of NoFap, a platform that encourages its users to refrain from masturbation. She claims her new lifestyle has led to a complete physical and mental reformation.“After starting NoFap I felt more motivation, more willpower and more discipline,” Kristel tells me. “I decided to take part in the movement because I like challenging myself and I wanted to prove that I could accomplish this.”The flippantly named NoFap community has gained a strange prominence since it was founded in 2011 by Pittsburgh web developer Alexander Rhodes. Inspired by a small study that suggested that male testosterone levels rose after seven days of abstinence from ejaculation, followers avoid masturbation in order to “reboot” their brains.Having first gained momentum among men in Reddit forums and backwaters of the internet, the community regards NoFap as a sexual health program to combat porn addiction. But there is also a consensus among many NoFappers (who often brand themselves “Fapstronauts”) that refraining from masturbation can lead to “superpowers”, ranging from increased energy and confidence to commanding respect from peers or curing social anxiety. NoFap’s Reddit forum now has more than 450,000 members primarily in North America and the UK, and Kristel is part of a smaller subset of female subscribers.In an attempt to engage its rising female cohort, NoFap has recently introduced new measures including hiring female moderators and creating women in reboot forums.Kristel explains: “Even though most of the responses I get are encouraging and positive, there is also a side of people not taking it seriously. They think girls don’t even masturbate to begin with.”Kristel has become something of a poster-girl for the Femstronaut movement, but there is a darker side to NoFap. Among the reams of Reddit discussions and YouTube videos, a fundamentally misogynistic rhetoric regularly emerges. The movement’s focus on testosterone inherently idealizes masculine traits, and the oft-cited claim that NoFap makes men more attractive to the opposite sex objectifies women and frames them as the “prize” in the game of who can hold out for longest. Some have even linked the movement to incel (involuntarily celibate) communities, who extend contempt towards masturbation and pornography to a more insidious hatred of women.So what drives women to participate in this male-dominated trend? Like Kristel, Chicago-based YouTuber Alana, 29, joined the NoFap movement as a lifestyle improvement in 2017.“I think the biggest issue is porn,” she says. “Porn is where people go to learn how to have sex, and most of the time the approach to sex in porn is built around the man’s pleasure. Even as a heterosexual woman, porn made me sexualize and objectify women … I also began to think of myself as a sex object, and that my value came from my sex appeal.”Kristel also cites the influence of pornography as a key driver of the trend. She says the unrelenting theme of male dominance, unrealistic body standards and the overly performative scenes made watching adult content a discomfiting experience for her. She claims that without pornography to masturbate to or compare her own experiences with, she is able to enjoy sex in a way that she wasn’t able to before.Sex addiction therapist Staci Sprout says the phenomenon really is “a new grassroots movement where people are seeking to reclaim their bodies separately from pornography’s input. If a woman has only learned how to self-pleasure through high-stimulation pornography and later just re-enacts this with others, she probably won’t know herself very well sexually.”It seems no coincidence that both Alana and Kristel, seemingly some of the most prominent and outspoken women in the NoFap movement, are part of a generation that has grown up with extreme sexual content only ever a few clicks away. Despite the almost non-existent science behind its claims, the NoFap movement seems to represent a solution to very real concerns. Yet it is not clear whether NoFap offers any relief. Although the thousands of women who post on NoFap might be benefiting from access to a community of like-minded people, it fails to provide the expert support that may realistically be needed for women struggling with sex or porn addiction.The women drawn to NoFap seem trapped in a conundrum of the digital age. They see themselves as victims of a world where access to online pornography is unlimited, but also end up seeking solutions within a similarly opaque and murky world. Although they may feel isolated from the male-centric world of pornography, their association with an ideology that idolizes the strange pseudo-science of semen retention and stereotypically masculine powers could only further isolate them from the nuances of female sexuality.And yet, Kristel has no plans to stop. “After years of abstaining, there is no restriction involved, it feels natural to me now,” she says. “I don’t feel any urge to go back.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/de753ca7a395ecb28a724e4fd27b1d0cc21e3302/0_11_3307_1985/master/3307.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b55ac775d46e2de3a19267b7a6fc5780","title":"inequality is it rising and can we reverse it","story":"The UK ranks among the most unequal nations in Europe and many people feel they are not sharing in the country’s wealthIncome inequality has risen sharply since the 1970s in most advanced economies around the world, and has been blamed for increasingly polarised politics.While growth powered ahead in the second half of the 20th century, and resumed more fitfully after the 2008-09 financial crisis, there have been major winners and losers from the wealth generated.Sir Angus Deaton, the Nobel prize-winning economist who is leading a five-year review of inequality with the leading Institute for Fiscal Studies thinktank, said: “There is this feeling that contemporary capitalism is not working for everybody.“There’s a sense that London is gobbling up everything and there are cities that are doing OK, but there are large parts of the country where that’s not the case at all.”There are a host of causes, including fiscal policy, technology, globalisation, deregulation, education, emasculation of trade unions and austerity.During the 19th and for much of the 20th century, inequality between countries rose dramatically as the world’s most advanced economies pulled ahead from poorer nations.According to the International Monetary Fund, the balance has been redressed more recently, reflecting strong growth in many developing nations, particularly China and India.The UK ranks among the most unequal nations in Europe, but is more equal than the US, the most ided wealthy nation in the world. According to one ranking system (the Gini coefficient – see below) South Africa is the most unequal country in the world. Scandinavian countries tend to have the lowest levels of inequality. According to the World Bank, Ukraine is the least unequal.The headline measurement of inequality is the Gini coefficient, also known as the Gini index. Named after Corrado Gini, the Italian statistician who developed the method during the early 20th century, the index gives a score from 0 to 100 to measure the distribution of a nation’s income or wealth. A score of 0 would represent total equality while 100 would represent total inequality, where one person has everything.The UK’s Gini score has remained in the mid-30s since the early 1990s, after peaking at 35.1 at the turn of the millennium.In that respect, the government can argue that inequality is not rising, as it remains roughly around the same level. However, that isn’t to say that inequality is not high. In the early 1960s, the Gini score stood at around 26 and stayed there until the late 1970s.Average chief executive pay in the FTSE 100 in 2017 was 145 times higher than that of the average worker, up from just 47 times in 1998. The lowest earning working households earn little more after inflation than they did in the mid-1990s.Against a backdrop of austerity and weaker economic growth since the financial crisis, academics suggest public perceptions of inequality have increased despite a relatively unchanged Gini score.Economists like analogies. One telling the impact of inequality goes like this: when the traffic comes to a standstill on a motorway, people often become irate when the lane next to their own pulls ahead, leaving them trapped. This appears to have increasingly become the feeling for many in society over the past decade as economic growth has raised the living standards of few, rather than many.“The trigger for people becoming more aware of inequality was the crisis and the slowdown in real growth,” says Milanovic. “It wasn’t a topic on its own that came up just as people saw Bill Gates or Jeff Bezos being rich. It came as incomes hadn’t risen as they’d been expecting they might be. And then somebody else really at the top was taking all the gains.”Average wages in Britain, adjusted for inflation, remain below the level seen before the financial crisis. But big pay rises are starting to return for people paid more than £1m a year.For the most part when we think about inequality we think about income or wealth. But there are isions beyond material standards of living, such as in health, education and social mobility, as well as between gender, race, age, geography and social groups.Deaton says changes to education policy, including the expansion of university access, may have had an impact on inequality.“You get an elite who think they did it all on their own and they deserve their position, and the people who didn’t pass exams and feel left behind. First they think the system is rigged which is a reasonable thing to think and then also partway blame themselves,” he says.“We’ve created this meritocratic aristocracy and people who didn’t make it are pissed off.”While some degree of inequality might be inevitable in a market-based system, extreme isions can have far-reaching consequences. Among the most visible in recent years is the polarisation of politics and the rise of populism in the UK and elsewhere around the developed world.Brexit in the UK and the election of Donald Trump in the US, as well as growing support for new political movements in Europe from both ends of the political spectrum, have been linked to rising inequality.Ted Howard, co-founder of the Democracy Collaborative, a leftwing research institute, says three people – Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos and Warren Buffett – own more wealth than bottom 160 million people in the US.“It’s not just as an economic fairness issue but also a democratic issue. Can you hold together a democratic culture and state when the wealth holding patterns show no democracy at all? It’s a great threat,” he says.Beyond political isions the rise of inequality could result in negative economic outcomes.Rightwing economists have argued that redistributing income is self-defeating, but the IMF believes societal isions can destabilise growth and create the conditions for a sudden slowdown. Economies can be stifled when millions of people are held back from contributing to their full potential.Complete equality might be impossible to achieve. Some economists say an entirely equal society might be undesirable, arguing that a wholly homogenous world would lack ersity and dynamism. However, the most important question to therefore ask is whether inequality has risen too far, how to reverse it and how to prevent extremes from arising.The prevailing logic of the past four decades has been that stronger economic growth serves as the greatest antidote to inequality. Increasing the size of the pie means everyone has a bigger slice. Peter Mandelson, the Labour peer, is famously quoted as saying in the 1990s that he was “intensely relaxed about people getting filthy rich as long as they pay their taxes” for this reason.Attitudes towards tackling inequality may depend on your view of work and how it is valued. Does hard work deserve higher pay? Is banking more valuable than nursing? Are financial incentives the best way to draw the best out of people?The main weapons for tackling inequality have been the tax and spending tools available to governments. Progressive taxation and welfare transfers are key, but are by no means the only way to combat the ision of income and wealth in society.Some economists and politicians have called for a universal basic income (UBI) to provide a safety net to prevent poverty, although such schemes could prove expensive, while others argue that more targeted spending on the most needy would be more effective. There are also calls to improve funding for education and services instead.The French economist Thomas Piketty, a world expert on inequality, has called for a global wealth tax, while the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development has suggested using higher inheritance taxes to reverse the extreme concentration of wealth.Wealth and inheritance taxes are politically sensitive and are often gamed through loopholes, made harder in an increasingly globalised world where capital can flow across borders and into tax havens. The mention of wealth taxes often leads to warnings that an economy could lose investment from the rich, who say they would flee overseas.One alternative as Ed Miliband famously advocated is the idea of predistribution, which aims to make the economy hard-wired to produce less inequality.Greater spending on health and education can lower the persistence of income inequality across generations, as well as drive up productivity rates, employment and earnings over the long run.The government has started forcing companies to report their gender pay gaps and mooted the idea of mandatory ethnic pay gap reporting, in the hope that greater awareness of the issues force companies to address them. Some countries go further, forcing companies to publish workers’ pay levels."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/786b185cded3469ad2dc0e5e58bf44c90fd13460/0_0_2090_1503/master/2090.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5d3c6e4c342ddc8f58535bfdd10918a1 700w","title":"john bercows biggest moments as speaker of the house of commons","story":"In a decade in the spotlight, the Speaker has both infuriated and delighted MPs In his 10 years as one of history’s most controversial and combative Commons Speakers, John Bercow has been no stranger to conflict. Here are some of his most memorable run-ins.1) Ahead of the 2015 general election, Bercow headed off an attempt to oust him by the Conservative party leadership. A motion for there to be a secret ballot to reselect a speaker when parliament returned, tabled by the then leader of the house, William Hague, was defeated by 228 to 202 amid emotional scenes. Labour MPs applauded him, while Bercow wiped away a tear.2) The Speaker was accused of breaking rules on political impartiality when he said Donald Trump was unfit to address MPs in Westminster because parliament was opposed to “racism and to sexism and our support for equality before the law and an independent judiciary”. He said that while he did not have the power to block a state visit, the opportunity to speak in the prestigious Westminster Hall was “not an automatic right, it is an earned honour”.The Speaker is the chief officer and the highest authority in the House of Commons.

Leadsom was at the forefront of moves to set up channels for dealing with complaints by Commons staff against their MP employers. It wasn’t the last time the pair were to clash. In March, Bercow reprimanded Leadsom for using her mobile phone during Commons business, while Leadsom later accused the Speaker of failing to show MPs “courtesy and respect”.5) In March this year, Bercow threw the government into a state of shock when he blocked an planned attempt by May to bring a third vote on her withdrawal bill to parliament. He cited a convention dating back to 1604 which says a vote on a motion that is “substantially the same” as a rejected motion should not be permitted. “The speaker did not forewarn us of the content of his statement or the fact that he was making one,” May’s spokeswoman told journalists that afternoon."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2332ba780fc7084e055117aae7ee5c7c3866786b/56_0_3388_2034/master/3388.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8db5658d78740e3a4e43dde983d8cee7","title":"john bercow to step down as speaker by 31 october","story":"Deputy speakers, Labour veterans and Tory MPs among the expected candidates John Bercow has dramatically announced that he will stand down as Commons Speaker within weeks, sparking a race among MPs to take over the crucial position.In an emotional speech, he told MPs he would resign on Monday night in the unlikely event they voted for an early general election. If, as expected, they do not support an early election, he will stand aside on 31 October.MPs expected to stand for the post include the deputy speakers Sir Lindsay Hoyle and Eleanor Laing, Labour veterans Harriet Harman, Meg Hillier and Chris Bryant, and the Tory MP Sir Henry Bellingham.The Speaker is the chief officer and the highest authority in the House of Commons.

He has announced he intends to step down on 31 October.The proposed timing for Bercow’s departure will be seen as a passing shot at his Brexiter critics because it could improve the chances of a remain-supporting MP succeeding him.It also ensures that he is expected to still be in post during the remaining momentous weeks in the run-up to Halloween, when Boris Johnson has promised Britain will leave the EU.In a break from normal convention whereby Speakers stand unopposed by the major parties at elections, the Conservatives had revealed on Sunday that they would challenge Bercow in his Buckingham constituency at the next national poll – whenever it is called.Bercow made his announcement on Monday afternoon as his wife, Sally, looked on from the gallery, telling a hushed Commons: “At the 2017 election, I promised my wife and children that it would be my last.“This is a pledge that I intend to keep. If the house votes tonight for an early general election, my tenure as Speaker and MP will end when this parliament ends.”After a pause, and to the sound of cheers from Labour and Liberal Democrat MPs, he said that if the house did not support an election, the least disruptive option would be for him to quit on 31 October– the current deadline for Brexit.He added: “Least disruptive because that date will fall shortly after the votes on the Queen’s speech expected on 21 and 22 October. The week or so after that may be quite lively and it would be best to have an experienced figure in the chair for that short period.“Most democratic because it will mean that a ballot is held when all members have some knowledge of the candidates,” he added.Senior MPs have been quietly gathering support since January preparing for a race to replace Bercow after rumours he would stand down in the summer. Bercow had pledged to stand down after nine years in the chair when he took up the role in 2009, but delayed his departure following the 2017 election.Hoyle is odds on to replace him according the bookmakers Coral, with Harman, a former leader of the house, at 4-1, followed by the former Labour chief whip Rosie Winterton and Bryant, a former deputy leader of the house.Hoyle declared his candidacy on Twitter on Monday night, saying that “in unprecedented times it will be vital to have an experienced Speaker who can provide stability and leadership.“I believe that I have proven myself to be independent and fair. I have ensured all members of parliament have been able to exercise their right to speak on behalf of constituents to hold the government to account,” he wrote.Bryant, the MP for Rhondda, has previously said: “I think people who know me will know I will be ruthlessly impartial and I hope I could diffuse any tensions with very, very gentle humour.”Traditionally, the two main parties have alternated the role of Speaker, but this tradition was broken by Labour in 2000 when Betty Boothroyd was replaced by Michael Martin.Friends of Laing, a Conservative MP, have pointed out that the house will have every right to choose a Tory candidate. Some Brexiters are supporting Bellingham.Bercow has been under pressure to stand down after being criticised in Dame Laura Cox’s report into bullying and harassment of staff last year.During nine years in the Speaker’s chair he has clashed with prime ministers, survived attempts to oust him and spoken out against the US president, Donald Trump.Bercow has also angered many in the government. He was accused of scuppering May’s Brexit deal after he stopped her from bringing back exactly the same bill unless the government asked a different question.He has faced fierce criticism from Brexiters, who have questioned his impartiality and claim he has facilitated efforts by MPs to take control of Commons business in order to oppose a no-deal exit.In parliament, Jeremy Corbyn praised Bercow for being a “superb” Speaker who had “totally changed the way in which the job has been done”.He added: “This parliament is stronger for your being Speaker. Our democracy is the stronger for your being the Speaker.“And whatever you do when you finally step down from parliament, you do so with the thanks of a very large number of people.”The de facto deputy prime minister, Michael Gove, joked that he hoped Bercow would not take it personally when he voted for an early general election. “It is the case that however controversial the role of the backstop may be in other areas, your role as the backbenchers’ backstop has certainly been one that’s been appreciated by iniduals across this house,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6822d11bde7dc91866acf548e15e9deeae2707bc/0_69_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b7a206ad87761c84fc301154b358efdd","title":"tuc head demands action to end class prejudice in workplace","story":"Working class faces rigged system of privilege, Frances O’Grady tells union conferenceThe head of the TUC has called for parliament to outlaw discrimination against working-class people at work, in an impassioned speech calling for parity of opportunity for lower-paid employees.In her address to the union umbrella body’s annual conference, Frances O’Grady reinforced demands that companies should be forced to report any gaps in pay between workers from different social backgrounds.Addressing hundreds of union delegates in Brighton, the general secretary said: “I want to issue a challenge to politicians. It’s high time we outlawed discrimination against working-class people. Let’s change the law and stamp out class prejudice once and for all.”She said the UK was wasting talent and skills because working-class people were shut out of opportunities. “It’s hard to rise by hard graft and talent alone. The system is rigged from the start. Where you come from. What your parents do. Your accent. Which school you went to. If you’re from a working-class family, the odds are stacked against you,” she said.O’Grady illustrated her argument by raising the behaviour of the leader of the Commons, Jacob Rees-Mogg, who was widely criticised for slouching across three seats in the chamber during a crucial Brexit debate last week.“Let’s be honest, Britain is still blighted by old-fashioned snobbery, too. Inflated egos and a sense of entitlement. Picture Jacob Rees-Mogg. Treating the government frontbench like his own living room sofa,” she said.The TUC has said that without new laws, people from working-class backgrounds will continue to face direct forms of discrimination, such as employer bias during job applications and interviews. It has also warned of indirect forms of discrimination such as the use of unpaid internships as a gateway into jobs.Issuing a challenge to the “Hovis ad” image, O’Grady redefined the term working class for the present day.“Today’s working class looks like modern Britain. As likely to work in an office as a factory. To be a care assistant, as a car worker. And to wear a hijab, as a football shirt. Or, quite possibly, both,” she said.O’Grady also issued another warning that the union movement would take action if Boris Johnson attempted to trick the UK into a no-deal Brexit or refused to obey the law.“If the prime minister tries to trick us or refuses to obey the law that stops no deal and workers vote to strike to defend their jobs, then the gloves are off. And I want to make this crystal clear – this whole movement will stand together,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af9720037d72616ca4e4c49736bc7aaf91f99e75/2346_1465_2686_1612/master/2686.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5b687324a0ced981e3ff174dc8e23769","title":"john bercows decade as speaker in pictures","story":"John Bercow has announced he will stand down as the Speaker of the House of Commons by 31 October at the latest.

When presented with an invalid passport, an officer will pick this up 99 times out of 100. Travellers found with invalid documents are sent to a holding cell. Let’s also imagine that UK passport control will, out of caution, very occasionally send someone to the holding cell whose passport is perfectly valid. These “false positives” occur just 0.1 per cent of the time.What proportion of travellers sent to holding cells are there because they genuinely had an invalid travel document?In other words, if you arrive in the holding cell, it is much more likely that you are there by mistake.Similarly – in certain types of screening for serious diseases, if your test comes up positive then it is much more likely that you don’t have the disease. I’ll explain why after I do the maths:No test is perfect – and false positives are often a lot more common than true ones.I set a puzzle here every two weeks on a Monday.

While all eyes were on the Dutch prodigy Mathieu van der Poel on a technical uphill finish which played completely to his strengths, his compatriot Groenewegen – very much one of the flat-earth brethren – struck out surprisingly early to take the honours in Newcastle, though the green race leader’s jersey remains on the shoulders of the stage two winner, Matteo Trentin.All the leaders looked wrong-footed by the stiff little climb of Grey Street, with a sweeping descent to the river beforehand, and a couple of little chicanes to set the nerves jangling. It was less the usual red mist, rather the fog on the Tyne. As the frontrunners gathered their wits on a finish none of them can have known, Groenewegen drifted away with 200 metres remaining in what looked initially more a feint than a sprint.His opponents had to get round Groenewegen’s two lead-out men, Mike Teunissen and Amund Grøndal Jansen, and in the split second it took them to gain a measure of the situation, the Dutchman was gone. Behind, Van der Poel had positioned himself too far back and had to come round both Trentin and his fellow Italian Davide Cimolai, and the upshot was that no one got within shouting distance of Groenewegen, who completely defied the conventional wisdom that the man who strikes out first on an uphill finish is bound to lose.For the second day running a breakaway came agonisingly close to making it to the finish, this time a six-man effort including the Scotts, Jacob and Robert, who ride for Swift and Wiggins respectively. Van der Poel’s man Dries de Bondt was there, so too the Belgian Christophe Noppe and the Irishman Rory Townsend, along with the local rider Harry Tanfield, who took a surprise stage win in the 2018 Tour de Yorkshire out of a very similar breakaway.As the race sped south from Berwick, the sextet were helped when a level crossing gate closed at a propitious moment between break and bunch, causing several minutes’ delay while the various bits of the race were stopped, put back in their proper place in the convoy, and restarted. That took the impetus out of the chase, led by Trentin’s Mitchelton-Scott and Cimolai’s Israel Cycling Academy. Ten kilometres out the breakaway still had a chance, but they were swept up with a kilometre to go.On Tuesday the race takes a completely different turn with a 173km run across the north Pennines to the Lake District. There is only one ascent ranked first category but in the final 130km there is a constant succession of climbs around or over the 300m mark. The stage has a profile like the Needles, and it culminates with the appropriately named climb up Beast Bank in Kendal, where Steve Cummings forged his 2016 overall victory. It will not decide the race but it will give it a very definite shape."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/009cfd051ac57277410b6bb57e310a64c45f0d21/544_136_2956_1774/master/2956.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9fc8e5245610d33f5cbac38665155116","title":"england must consider captaincy top four wicketkeeper","story":"Joe Root is not a disaster – he has still not lost a home series – but his captaincy weakens England in two ways. It diminishes their only world-class batsman: Root’s average as captain slumps from 53 to 41 and the hundreds dry up. And it stops them maximising limited resources, as Eoin Morgan has done with the 50-over team. Root played most of his Tests under Alastair Cook and it shows. He is doggedly orthodox, then suddenly, unconvincingly, funky he seems one step behind, not ahead he will have Australia teetering at 44 for four, then settle for containment. He can be tactless, waving at Jofra Archer from slip to order him to go round the wicket, rather than having a quiet word from mid-off.He is oddly inconsistent, using a nightwatchman as a shield, cashing in with a crucial 71, then spurning one two nights later and falling first ball. A true captain can be spotted just by listening – is he intense, forensic, a touch fanatical? Nasser Hussain is, Mike Atherton is not. Michael Vaughan is, Alastair Cook not. Stuart Broad is, Joe Root not. Let Broad take over for now, until Jos Buttler returns to form or Rory Burns becomes a fixture. And let Root bat and bat.Australia’s openers are averaging around 10, an all-time Ashes low, but they have Steve Smith and Marnus Labuschagne, the sorcerer and his apprentice, to magic away the mess. England’s openers have been better, averaging 27 – the latest, Joe Denly, still unsure of his Test place, sails into this summer’s composite XI.But England’s top order remains brittle, with Root a reluctant No 3 and Jason Roy, a walking wicket as an opener with his hard hands, only slightly more comfortable at No 4. For Trevor Bayliss’s farewell, the selectors have deferred to his dictum that he would rather give a batsman too many chances than too few. Soon, opportunity will knock for Dom Sibley and Ollie Pope, young men who make big hundreds.England have three wicketkeeper-batsmen with better credentials than Tim Paine of Australia, yet it is Paine who will lift the Ashes urn next week. England have got their keepers in a twist. The best gloveman is Ben Foakes, who also made a Test hundred on debut, only to be dropped after a few low scores (no sign of Bayliss’s dictum there). The best batsman should be Jonny Bairstow but his recent Test record smacks of a one-day specialist – which is what Buttler was until Ed Smith audaciously reinstated him to the Test side 16 months ago. In Morgan’s team it is all perfectly clear: Buttler keeps, Bairstow opens, Foakes is Buttler’s understudy (one game so far, one match-winning knock). What would Morgan do with the Test gauntlets? Hand them to Foakes, surely, and leave Buttler and Bairstow, who seldom bat well together, to contest the No 6 spot.England are often accused of bringing their one-day swagger to Test cricket, as if they were going to church in their party shirts. And they are not guilty. At Old Trafford they batted for 30 more overs than Australia and scored 185 fewer runs. In the series England have faced 345 more balls and made 320 fewer runs – the opposite of their one-day method. If anything, they have not been aggressive enough.Or perhaps judicious enough. At Old Trafford straight balls – the kind that never find their way past Steve Smith – dismissed Root, Roy, Bairstow and Buttler twice each. England’s strokemakers have to get better at keeping out the good balls, while remembering to use the crease, rotate the strike and force metronomic bowlers to change their settings.Even without Jimmy Anderson, England have used the new ball superbly. They have discovered a superstar in Archer and rediscovered a stalwart in Broad. The two sides’ new-ball pairs, through the series, both have a strike rate in the mid-40s. The difference between them has been Smith – without him, Australia’s collective batting average is 26 to England’s 27 – and the back-up bowling.No England bowler bar Broad or Archer has taken a four-fer. Chris Woakes has been steady, unlucky, perhaps weary from the World Cup Craig Overton more impressive with the bat than the ball Ben Stokes a strange mixture of inspiration and ineptitude. After Nathan Lyon outshone Moeen Ali at Edgbaston England adapted fast, dropping Moeen and defusing Lyon by playing him off the back foot. With Australia’s seamers they have found no such solution."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6eae8184db750db29882f7c329fad942f11cce40/0_107_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=28f314515e743fb214d9645990ff4fa7","title":"us open rafael nadal","story":"Rafa Nadal has never taken his talent for granted. Of the three players who have defined his era, he is the most humble. So, as he stands on the verge of surpassing Roger Federer’s 20 majors and drawing away from the 16 owned by Novak Djokovic, he knows that beating one of the hunting pack, Daniil Medvedev, to win his fourth US Open was significant in more ways than one.Sunday’s teeth-grinding five‑setter, which he could have ended way before its eventual four hours and 50 minutes duration, proved to everyone – including the winner – that, at 33, he has the will to continue.For others of that age or thereabouts the questions are different: none dreams of bettering Federer or Djokovic all of them are happy to be still standing, including Andy Murray, whose comeback from hip surgery continues steadily away from the main stage.For Nadal it has always been like this. Since he won the first of his 19 majors – at Roland Garros, where he would win another 11 and where he surely will be favourite for as long as he wants – he has lived in Federer’s shadow. So has Djokovic.Often Federer’s grace under pressure, his sheer artistry in a physical sport and his winning demeanour has made him unbeatable in the eyes of millions. Even when he loses they love him still. There are books written about the love affair. No such tome exists for Nadal or Djokovic. They are praised prosaically, for the technical mastery they have over a difficult sport.Yet those who have watched Nadal closely will have seen how the hard work he does away from the court manifests itself in subtle ways in the heat of battle – and there was a lot of heat on Sunday night when, after butchering a smash in the third set when he was close to a straightforward victory, he found ways to win.In front of him was a young opponent in his first slam final who displays aspects of Djokovic’s stretching defence and Federer’s outrageous cleverness. Nadal prevailed because he had seen it all before, however demanding the struggle became. Only bona fide champions can win when it looks likely they will lose.After a 7-5, 6-3, 5-7, 4-6, 6-4 win that kept 24,000 fans swaying between the Spaniard and the Russian in their affections Nadal said: “The last three hours of the match were very, very intense, no? Very tough mentally and physically, too. The crowd were amazing, all these facts that make the moment super special, no? Unforgettable moment.”For once reference to the crowd was not fatuous. They more than likely did play a part. The New York fans are the loudest, most passionate and certainly most fickle in tennis. At the start they were with Nadal. All fortnight Medvedev had wound them up, behaving like a brat at the beginning, then inviting their derision to give him strength and, finally, winning their admiration for the beauty of his game and his fighting heart in one of the truly great finals.He was gobsmacked in a totally Russian way, repeating over and again what it meant to him to be part of history. “I’m sure even talking about Rafa’s 19 grand slams, I’m sure he remembers his first final, even though he won it and I lost it. It was an amazing match. It’s an amazing story. All this summer is amazing for me. I will remember every moment of it.”And there he nailed it. His summer roll is what carried him to the final. Medvedev had won all over the place leading up to the tournament, 12 matches in a row. Crucially, his most recent defeat had been to Nadal, a 6-3, 6-0 king in Montreal. But he is young enough for such a score not to unsettle his confidence or self-belief.Like Bianca Andreescu, the 19-year-old Canadian who, the night before, slew a legend in Serena Williams, Medvedev has the courage of youth. He is not scarred by serial failure. He believes that when he drop-shots from the baseline the ball will float silently over the net and do its job.He did that time and again to Nadal, whose legs do not have the spring they once did. But Nadal did not fold. Nor did he complain. He drew on the thousands of similar circumstance he has been in to find a way.He recognised in Medvedev not just the tennis qualities of Federer and Djokovic but the extra ingredient it takes to be different from the others. “The way that he fought, the way that he played, is a champion way,” Nadal said. “Just well done for him. I really believe that he will have many more chances.”He meant that. He will not be around on the circuit to witness first‑hand all of Medvedev’s career but he is not disappearing just yet. He is a remarkable champion and very much a unique one."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2c56459736d105ee3982f218f6d0e0aa328844e7/0_110_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=76dc93328035da14d7c75d09e1c0b7bc","title":"us open talking points andreescu","story":"Novak Djokovic arrived in New York with a shoulder injury, then Roger Federer suffered a stiff neck against Grigor Dimitrov. No matter. Rafael Nadal was there to represent the big three and to take his 19th grand slam title, putting him one behind Federer. So much is on the line in these last years of their careers and each final seems to be laced with more historical significance than before. Had Nadal finished off Federer in the 2017 Australian Open final, he would already be the leader. Had Federer won one more point against Djokovic this summer at Wimbledon, he would have fended off his two rivals for just a little longer. In the end, none of this matters. They have faced each other so frequently over the past 14 years that by now, everyone already knows who they consider the best and no outcome will change minds. But it sure makes for a good story.Days after her first grand slam title at 19 years old, it is still difficult to compute the scale of Bianca Andreescu’s achievements this year. Tennis has seen many sublime breakthroughs in the past, but after winning Indian Wells then reaching the last 16 in Miami in March, Andreescu played only one match in four months. Lack of match fitness should be an impediment to success, yet she launched herself abck in with a 14-match winning streak. She hasn’t lost a completed match since 1 March. Andreescu is blessed with a varied and potent game, but the most impressive aspect of her tournament was how well she played the big points. Until those final desperate games against Williams, not once did it seem as if she would falter in an important moment. She never did.After an exhausting summer of 20 wins in 22 matches, Daniil Medvedev stood two sets and a break down to Rafael Nadal in a grand slam final, yet still had the audacity to believe he could win. The spirit and clarity that Medvedev showed as he turned the final around was confirmation that there is so much more to come. Despite rising in the rankings by grinding opponents down, in his first grand slam final he stepped closer to the baseline, took more risks and swept to the net 74 times in total. Over the past two years just about every other player of the 23-year-old’s generation has been hyped as the next big thing. How refreshing that the biggest success has come to the player who quietly worked hard in the background, far from view.Johanna Konta was ground down in straight sets by Elina Svitolina but she had made another spirited run to the quarter-finals, beating the third seed, Karolina Pliskova, en route. She has now reached the last eight of each grand slam, a significant achievement. Konta is blessed with numerous strengths in her serve, groundstrokes and good movement, yet it is easy to see her as an overachiever who has eked much out of her inefficient technique and limited hand skills. Although she missed a golden opportunity to win a grand slam at the French Open this year, she keeps on putting herself in the right positions. Future draws could break open for her again."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/70cf31ec217587b72f8235d59f0f810394315cff/0_0_500_300/master/500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e9f4f402325d59d00acc0d56340bdea5","title":"rugby world cup 2019 japan team guide","story":"Hosts Japan hope home advantage will help them break the glass ceiling to reach the knockout stages for the first timeHosts Japan hope home advantage will help them break the glass ceiling to reach the knockout stages for the first timeJapan come into the Rugby World Cup as Pacific Nations Cup champions, a team who are clearly too good for the other perceived Tier 2 nations and who hope to add to their Tier 1 scalps. Since their exploits in England four years ago when they became the first team to win three matches but fail to reach the knockout stages, the Brave Blossoms have played 31, winning 18, drawing one and losing 12. While their record against the recognised big boys is 1-1-11, their record against teams generally classified as second tier is 17-1. But with home advantage on their side the Japan captain, Michael Leitch, is hoping the side can attain their goal of a top-eight finish and then go even further. The 30-year-old flanker, who will be appearing in his third World Cup, said: “In my opinion, the only reason we would ever lose a match would be because we couldn’t execute what we aimed to do. I don’t imagine us losing because the opponent is stronger than us.” “I hope to build the team so we can aim for the title. If we focus on preparation, we will be able to play consistently and the results will follow.” Leitch will lead a side that contains a mix of speed, power and versatility – the latter the result of both necessity and desire. As their head coach, Jamie Joseph, said: “I am looking for players who under pressure can play different positions.” A perceived lack of homegrown talent at lock means flankers such as Uwe Helu and Wimpie van der Walt will likely line up alongside veteran Luke Thompson, who was persuaded to come out of international retirement to make a run at a fourth World Cup. In the backs, players such as Will Tupou, Rikiya Matsuda and Kotaro Matsushima are all capable of playing a number of positions with Joseph and the attack coach, Tony Brown, aware that Japan will need different gameplans depending on the opposition in the pool stages. So what are Japan’s strengths? The back row – with Joseph able to call upon Leitch, Kazuki Himeno, Amanaki Mafi and Pieter “Lappies” Labuschagne – is a mix of athleticism and power, Kenki Fukuoka and Matsushima have pace and finishing skill out wide, while hooker Shota Horie and scrum-half Fumiaki Tanaka have a wealth of experience. Defensively, Japan looked much improved during the Pacific Nations Cup. But they will need to improve their discipline, particularly at the scrum. As Joseph said: “The players are prepared physically. It is about putting all those things into the game and executing under pressure.” * Rich Freeman is a rugby writer and commentator based in Japan"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b651a80eb61dec3a629a13f302ee89b9a31a369f/0_55_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e3182094a9ba866be7fc99ec8225ff8e","title":"the magicians trying to change the world one card trick at a time","story":"Forget trying to saw Debbie McGee in half – some conjurers are using their skills to help surgeons, refugee children and even imagine a better futureWhat image does the word “magic” conjure up? Paul Daniels sawing Debbie McGee in half, or Harry Potter chanting “Expecto patronum”? Or perhaps just a sweaty little man (they are almost always men) trying gamely to placate a party of sugar-high six-year-olds with balloons while their parents slip out the back?With its razzmatazz, secrecy and ritualised trickery, being a magician is not a calling most associate with a social conscience. But there is an intellectual dimension to magic that was already old the first time someone thought of putting an egg into a bag and then making it disappear (believed to be in the 16th century). Good magicians have always understood and exploited the psychological blind spots of their audience. In 1876, a magician known as Professor Hoffmann collected a series of articles he had written for a popular boys’ magazine into a book, Modern Magic, which explained how classic tricks were performed. “He believed young people should learn to perform magic because it would be useful in their professional lives and in the furtherance of the British empire,” one present-day acolyte, Will Houston, tells me. “Magic teaches you to stand in front of a room and talk, problem-solve, deceive and spot deception.”Today, the practical applications of magic are being used by a new generation to conjure up a better world.A shy man, he comes alive when swallowing a balloon or pulling a multicoloured streamer from his mouth, but his first charity job was as a volunteer agricultural adviser on a tree-planting scheme in Palestine. After rising up the ranks into management, he decided he wanted to return to working directly with the people he had set out to help.Now he has set up a charity called Magic for Smiles. “‘Psychosocial’ is a bit of a buzzword. But being in a community where your parents don’t have any status, and you can’t play because it’s quite cramped, is very stressful. There’s obviously happiness and de-stressing through entertainment, but magic also helps with concentration, creativity and interaction. Funding is a problem, and it’s quite a lonely life just me and my bunnies driving around. But it’s worth it to see the children’s faces light up.”Clive Wilkins and Nicky Clayton“Pick a number between one and 100,” says Clive Wilkins. So I do, but don’t tell him which one. For him and his professional partner, Nicky Clayton, magic is no less than a portal to the future. Clayton is a professor of comparative cognition in the psychology department at Cambridge University, where Wilkins – an artist and novelist as well as a magician – has a permanent residency. The pair met at a tango class and are never seen abroad together without identical homburg hats.But their showbizzy style conceals a serious academic purpose, which they are promoting around the world in illustrated lectures designed to fundamentally challenge the way people think (next stops: China and Germany). “The argument we have been developing is that magic reveals a number of interesting roadblocks in our thinking,” says Clayton. Such as? “There’s egocentric bias – where we think others see and think more like us than they really do and confirmation bias, where we see what we expect to see, so can miss the most obvious things. Magic capitalises on these blind spots in our thinking magic occurs in the mind of the spectator, not the hands of the magician.”Wilkins seamlessly picks up the baton: “We suggest that the human brain has been very good at creating civilisation over the last millennia, but in a postmodern world, scientists and artists are wondering what the next development is going to be. Perhaps the way forward is to find some alternative way of seeing. Maybe we can trick ourselves into seeing further. We have to see over and above ourselves.” With that, he waves a piece of paper in my face. It reads “46”, the number I had almost forgotten I picked. I leave with the roadblocks rattling in my brain.“At 19, I couldn’t cook or pour a drink. I’d never eaten with a knife and fork. It’s really embarrassing on a date to ask: ‘Please can you cut up my food?’” says Cat Lee, who is based in Merseyside. She is now a poised 22-year-old law graduate, but is more interested in developing her modelling career than pursuing a legal career. Part of the thrill of it, she says, is that her bookers don’t know she has cerebral palsy.The turning point in her life came when her mother signed her up for a summer camp for young people with hemiplegia, a condition that leaves one side of the body incapacitated, and can be caused by stroke, epilepsy or a head injury, as well as cerebral palsy. The camps are run by Breathe Arts Health Research, a charity set up more than a decade ago by a group of magicians who believed the dexterity used in magic tricks could be used therapeutically to help young people who had little support from the health system.Working with occupational therapists from a London hospital, they discovered that some children could make life-changing progress in coordination – and confidence – in just a fortnight. Its co-founder David Owen (who is also a barrister) demonstrates a trick – the mystery of the jumping coins – in which money appears to leap from one place to another. Repeating it in slow motion, he shows how it involves a series of 10 movements, from pinching the coins to pick them up to pressing both palms flat on the table and turning hands over together and separately. “It’s a professional-level piece of magic that some children master and others don’t, but for all of them, it is building skills that most of us take for granted,” he says.Cat was one of their successes, who left the 10-day course capable of building an independent life and is now a mentor, encouraging younger children at the camps. She doesn’t do magic tricks herself, but uses the props to exercise her hands. She credits the performance skills she learned with enabling her to overcome her physical difficulties and the resulting psychological ones. Her tears well up as she recalls the camp’s impact on her life. “Now I am who I am, and I can never thank them enough.”Will Houston and Roger Kneebone“As a student, I saw medicine as a science. As a surgeon, I saw it as a skill. As a GP, I saw it much more as a performance, and as a patient, I see it as all three,” says Prof Roger Kneebone. He is sitting in the cafe at the Wellcome Trust in London. Opposite him is a younger man whose gaze is steady and intense, and whose hands are in constant motion, flicking and cutting a pack of playing cards.Kneebone runs a master’s course in surgical education at Imperial College, and the man with him is Will Houston, one of the UK’s leading closeup magicians and editor of the Magic Circle’s house magazine, the Magic Circular. Five years ago, they started working together to investigate the parallels between magic and surgery.“First, I was looking at dexterity, as both involve sleight of hand,” says Kneebone, “but most of a surgeon’s time isn’t spent in the operating theatre, and I realised there were far deeper parallels around capturing and managing attention.” He set up a radical department of performance science and appointed Houston its magician in residence, and they began to give joint lectures.Magicians are, by necessity, secretive, Houston says, but there is a separation between a magic trick and the techniques used to make it work – such as how to create a theatrically exaggerated state that looks natural, and shift attention with your gaze. “If you want someone to look at an object, look at it. If you want them to look at you, look at them.” He illustrates his point with a baffling three-coin vanishing trick.A medical consultation is a complicated process in which a surgeon has to listen to a patient while simultaneously making judgments and taking clinical notes. The ability to create a connection – to hold that patient in thrall – hasn’t traditionally been considered part of a surgeon’s skill set, yet it is as important to clinical practice as it is to a magic show, they explain. For the patient, it’s the difference between feeling heard, and safe, or just another statistic, another chore. “Magic doesn’t work if you do it at people and neither does medicine,” says Kneebone. “A medical consultation is all about dual narratives: what is really going on and what seems to be going on, so even if you’re delivering bad news, the patient has a sense they are further on.”“My whole interest in magic came from an interaction with a 16-year-old autistic boy,” says Goldie Puricelli. “He was into magic, so I learned a trick out of a cracker and when I showed it to him, it sparked concentration. It was only a crappy little trick, but it stopped me in my tracks.”Within two years, Puricelli had charmed her way into the Magic Circle with a repertoire of tricks involving cards and coins. A one-time teenage runaway, Puricelli has worked for 20 years in a south London special needs unit, and began using magic as an incentive for children with dyslexia. “I said I’d reward them with a new trick every week before I realised how hard that was,” she laughs. “But it’s great, especially for the girls, because then they go on and learn for themselves.”Soon, she was wondering if she could put it to work for another marginalised sector by incorporating British Sign Language. This would stop deaf people being excluded from the magic of magic by having to look simultaneously at the magician and an interpreter. “Everyone, from magicians to interpreters, said it couldn’t be done because it involved using two languages simultaneously,” she says. So she teamed up with a deaf YouTuber, Jazzy Whipps, and within an hour they had scripted a bilingual card trick. It wasn’t just any old trick, but one regarded as a holy grail of closeup magic which involves identifying a randomly selected playing card in a pack and is known in the magic community as Any Card at Any Number.Puricelli is now turning her attention back to autistic teenagers to see if she can use simple tricks to help them with social interaction. The signs so far are good. “It’s a double illusion,” she says. “There’s the trick itself, but also the illusion of intimacy. People on the autism spectrum tend to struggle to make eye contact and the trick gives them a way of connecting within their safe boundary.” Importantly, for young people who often feel they have no prospects, she says, “it also gives them a skill that can lead somewhere”.Smoke and Mirrors: The Psychology of Magic, at the Wellcome Collection, London, is on until 15 September."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/adb358aea9f8fd7481f5791aea77ad4a330a0c6b/0_132_5600_3360/master/5600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8a6ffe59aaf6c22ad9096bdfc75331e0","title":"share cultural highlights of japan for the chance to win a 200 hotel voucher","story":"Tell us about your best experiences, from visiting ancient temples to manga comic stores in Tokyo or Osaka … anywhere you’ve enjoyed Japanese culture old or newYou may have walked a pilgrimage trail, attended sumo wrestling or bathed in a hot spring.

But those with such documentation were asked to get off the Balearia after the passenger manifest was submitted to the US federal agency on Sunday night, according to some of the crew, because they said the US would not accept them.CBP fired back on Monday. Mark Morgan, the acting commissioner, said there was simply “confusion” over people fleeing the Bahamas being able to come to the US.“We will accept anyone on humanitarian reasons that needs to come here,” he said at a White House briefing, adding that those with serious criminal records were automatically disqualified.Stephen Silvestri, the acting director for CBP at Port Everglades, told a reporter from Miami news station WSVN who was onboard the ferry: “If those folks did stay on the boat and arrived we would have processed them, vetted them and worked within our laws and protocols and done what we had to do to facilitate them.”“I think it was a business decision by Balearia to remove them. They were not ordered off the boat by any government entity.”The ship’s owners, Balearia Caribbean, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Most of the passengers had spent hours at the crowded dock in Freeport on Sunday, trying to secure a seat on board the 1,000-capacity vessel.Renard Oliver, an evacuee from Grand Bahama trying to reach Florida with his two young daughters, told WSVN: “They’re saying they just got a call from CBP and CBP told them that everyone that doesn’t have a US visa and was travelling on a police record has to come off.“At the last minute like this it’s kind of disappointing. It’s hurting watching my daughters cry.”On Saturday, 1,500 evacuees from Grand Bahama reached Palm Beach, Florida, aboard the Grand Celebration, a ship operated by Paradise Cruise Line. The difference, according to CBP, was that Paradise had coordinated the voyage with Bahamian government and US officials in Nassau, the capital of the Bahamas.“CBP relies on the transportation companies … to be engaged in ensuring the safety and wellbeing of any iniduals that have been devastated by this tragedy and that requires transparent communication and planning for adequate resources to receive any arrival,” a CBP statement issued on Monday said.Since the category 5 hurricane tore into north-western islands of the Bahamas eight days ago, with winds gusting above 200mph and a storm surge of more than 20ft, thousands have been evacuated to Nassau or the US.Military transport planes flying from Abaco and Grand Bahama enhanced efforts begun by dozens of operators of private boats and aircraft in the immediate aftermath of the storm.Marco Rubio, the US senator for Florida, backed the CBP position in a Monday lunchtime tweet, claiming that it appeared Balearia “didn’t coordinate in advance. And decided to leave instead of waiting a few hours to complete process.”Rubio toured the worst-hit islands last week with his fellow US senator Rick Scott and Ron DeSantis, the former and current governors of Florida, the trio urging the Trump administration to waive or suspend certain visa requirements for Bahamian nationals to come to the US.In a series of tweets, Morgan, the acting commissioner of CBP, said no visa documentation requirements had changed. Immigration officers at points of entry, he said, had discretion “to issue humanitarian or medical parole on a case-by-case basis”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/177a52e4521e5eec56f1bb5e3a7f5b722f6a7954/268_191_1852_1110/master/1852.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ac242b71d4163a99605c28a53186cb9d","title":"south africa asks rwanda to hand over karegeya suspects","story":"Patrick Karegeya, former Rwandan spy chief, became enemy of President Paul KagameSouth Africa has asked Rwanda to extradite two men suspected of murdering the former Rwandan intelligence chief Patrick Karegeya, in a move likely to sour relations between the two countries.Lawyers in Johannesburg representing the family of Karegeya, whose body was found in the city’s Michelangelo hotel on New Year’s Day 2014, said South African prosecutors had informed them they had issued arrest warrants for Ismael Gafaranga, commonly known as Apollo, and Alex Sugira, who are both believed to be resident in Rwanda.South Africa’s justice department is due to lodge extradition requests with authorities in the Rwandan capital, Kigali, and prosecutors will then apply to Interpol for red notices to be issued against the suspects. These provide Interpol’s member states with lists of internationally wanted iniduals.“This is fantastic news,” said Kennedy Gihana, a Rwandan lawyer who represents Karegeya’s family. “At last justice has prevailed. It can be 30 years or 40 years but these people will be prosecuted in the end.”The decision to launch a formal extradition process injects new life into a case that has been a stain on Kigali’s international reputation and a five-year embarrassment for both governments involved.In the wake of Karegeya’s murder, the judicial trail went mysteriously cold. The involvement of Afriforum, a non-governmental organisation and pressure group more often associated in South Africa with white minority causes, kicked the process back into life last year.Gerrie Nel, the head of Afriforum’s private prosecution unit, hailed the move as proof there had been a miscarriage of justice, pointing out that the warrants had been issued without any further investigation taking place.Karegeya was a schoolmate and personal friend of Rwanda’s president, Paul Kagame, and rose to become head of external intelligence in Rwanda. He fled to South Africa in 2010 after serving prison time for insubordination. Gen Faustin Kayumba Nyamwasa, Rwanda’s former army chief of staff, later joined forces with him there, setting up the Rwanda National Congress, an opposition party in exile.Rwanda’s government denounced the RNC as a terrorist organisation and has repeatedly asked Pretoria to send its members to Kigali to face trial – requests the South African authorities have ignored. Kayumba, who has survived repeated attempts on his life while in exile, is under 24-hour protection paid for by the South African state.Rwanda’s high commissioner to Pretoria, Vincent Karega, said Kigali was not aware of any extradition request by the South African authorities.Relatives of Karegeya are deeply sceptical that Kagame will agree to collaborate with the requests for extradition. However, they see the case as an opportunity to expose a pattern of sustained intimidation and targeted extrajudicial killings condoned by the president. Human rights campaigners say Rwanda, whose head of state is feted at international conferences for its development record and economic growth rates, has repeatedly sent trained killers to murder opponents abroad, while jailing, intimidating and detaining without charge the few critics that remain at home.“I highly doubt they will comply,” said Leah Karegeya, the victim’s widow, who now lives in Washington. “But let’s wait for the first reaction from Kigali.”Four Rwandans, including Gafaranga and Sugira, were identified in a court in Johannesburg this year as possible perpetrators. They were suspected of booking a room at the Michelangelo in order to ambush Karegeya during the New Year break. Gihana said while there was a plethora of evidence against all four, extradition requests were premised on “overwhelming” as opposed to “circumstantial” evidence."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6dfae2e35157d61246911d4f840a12db7532686d/1_23_899_539/master/899.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2dd6b1499bd7a46a0e88c91df7bf9db2","title":"why do dubai princesses keep trying run away podcast","story":"Ola Salem discusses the orce case of Princess Haya, who fled to London.

Photograph: Bryan O’BrienLast week, in an idle moment, Pricewatch took to Twitter and asked about the shops which have closed that people missed the most.The response was enormous and, within minutes, we were swamped by a wave of nostalgia for book shops that are no more and supermarkets which have been eaten whole by rivals.There were shops that fell victim to an online retailing revolution which opened the world to Irish shoppers while closing the doors of many shops.There were one-time institutions killed by a sudden and seismic shift in how content is consumed, and others which just disappeared as those behind them aged and retired or died. Here are just some of the shops which are gone but not yet forgotten.Star recordsBack in the 1980s, this Galway record shop had three branches in the comparatively small city. Now there are none and there hasn’t been one for a long, long time.To be honest, we could have named any one of the hundreds of record shops which have shut over the past couple of decades after being swamped by a crushing wave of music in the forms of ones and zeroes and by the online retailing giants that stole their lunch and beat them up in the process.Alongside the aforementioned, there was the Virgin Megastore on Dublin’s Aston Quay, Dolphin Discs, Road Records on Dublin’s Fade Street, HMVs all over the place as well as countless others, big and small, in virtually every town in Ireland.There are some that are still standing – notably, perhaps, Golden Discs – and the sale of vinyl has seen something of a resurgence in recent years but, even so, the days of hanging out in record shops, sifting through the stock, listening to the staff picks and making life-changing musical discoveries by chance appear to be gone forever. Mindlessly scrolling through Spotify playlists is not quite the same thing.Gone forever are the hours people of a certain age wasted hanging round video stores trying to find something a couple or group of friends could agree to watch together.Try to explain to a child of the 21st century what a video library was and watch confusion cloud their faces. “You mean you had to leave your house in the dead of winter and go to a shop miles away from your home – a shop you had to pay to be a member of – and try to rent a film that you would want to watch, as long as it had not been already borrowed by someone else? You then had to hand over £3 in old money for it and remember to bring it back within 24 hours or else risk being hit with a massive fine?”Now we have Netflix. For a quarter of a century, video and DVD libraries were the kings of the entertainment world. But video was killed by the streaming stars which were legal, illegal and somewhere in the middle. The biggest casualty in Ireland was Xtra-Vision which closed its shop doors for the last time in January 2016. It had had a rollercoaster ride to be fair and flirted with death more than once.It was opened in 1981 and could do no wrong in the early days leading to an Irish stock exchange flotation in the late 1980s. It hit stormy waters in 1990 and again in 1993 when it went into examinership. In 1996 it was bought by Blockbuster but sold back to Irish investors in 2009. Then in 2011 it entered examinership again and got into difficulty again two years later before finally closing in 2016.Pat Quinn opened his first supermarket in Stillorgan in December 1966 after his then employer HW Williams declined to take his advice and open a store there. Its loss was his gain and within five years he had six stores and a turnover of £6 million. He then sold out to Galen Weston’s Associated British Foods (ABF) which expanded the enterprise rapidly across the State. It gave us Yellow Pack groceries, a phrase which quickly became synonymous with poor quality products and low-paid jobs which is why the own brand range was ultimately re-branded KVI.Quinnsworth’s marketing director, and then chief executive, Maurice Pratt became something of a star in the Ireland of the 1980s with his cheesy grins and cheesier ads. Then, in 1997 Tesco bought the business from ABF (which had the good sense to hang on to the PenneysPrimark brand) and Quinnsworth was soon gone.The other big supermarket to disappear was, of course, Superquinn, although it wasn’t nationwide. It was brought to life by the irrepressible Feargal Quinn at the start of the 1960s. He focused on quality offerings and excellent customer service throughout his long and stellar career and, with uncannily good timing, the Quinn family sold the business and its property portfolio in 2005.Within five years, and largely as a result of the crash, the buyers, Select Retail Holdings, were in big trouble. They sold the business to Musgraves for a fraction of what they paid for it and the chain was then re-branded as SuperValu in 2014. The sausages were saved – sort of – although the days when they were made in-store by Superquinn butchers are long since gone.Like both Quinnsworth and Superquinn, Roches Stores never really closed but was instead swallowed whole by a competitor. Of all the stores mentioned by Twitter users, this was the one that appears to have been missed the most and dozens of people referenced it.It was founded in Cork 1901 by William Roche, a farmer’s son who had started out in Cash’s of Cork. His business grew slowly but steadily until its expansion was stopped in its tracks by drunken British soldiers who destroyed Roche’s swanky new Patrick Street store in late 1920. He kept going, moving to a smaller premises before eventually getting compensation from the British state and returning to Patrick Street.He opened a second branch on Dublin’s Henry Street in 1927 and another in Limerick a decade later. Then came the shop in Galway and one in Wilton in Cork and Blackrock in Dublin. In 2006 all nine Roches Stores outlets were sold to the Debenhams department store chain.Ireland’s first FW Woolworth store opened in April 1914 on Grafton Street with the US retailing giant opening more stores across Ireland in the years that followed. In the 1930s the American ision merged it with the UK chain and dozens more shops opened in locations including Galway, Limerick, Waterford, Carlow and Tipperary. Some shops thrived, some struggled. In 1984 the company closed all 18 of it remaining shops and left the Republic.This shop, so beloved of Dubliners for its elaborate Christmas windows and, by all accounts, wonderful Santa Claus, opened its doors for the first time in 1838, a full 11 years before its neighbour and long-standing rival Brown Thomas was born. Both stores thrived and were largely responsible for Grafton Street becoming the pre-eminent shopping street in Ireland.Fast forward to the late 1980s and Switzers was seriously struggling. In 1989, Brown Thomas tried to buy the Switzer Group, which by then included the Grafton Street shop, Cash’s of Cork, Moons of Galway and Todds of Limerick, from the House of Fraser, which, as it happened, was owned by the Al Fayed brothers who also famously owned Harrods. However, Brown Thomas was outbid.But, as the saying goes, what’s meant for you doesn’t pass you by and that sale collapsed allowing Brown Thomas to take control of its neighbour in 1991 after paying less than €10 million. In 1994, Brown Thomas sold its store across the road to Marks \u0026amp Spencer for £20 million and Switzers and Brown Thomas became one on Valentine’s Day 1995, under the name Brown Thomas. Cash’s, Moons and Todds continued to trade under their original names until 1998 after which they were all rebranded Brown Thomas.When Peats of Parnell Street opened its doors in 1934 it was a world away from fancy electronics and sub woofers and the like. It sold batteries, bikes, beds and buggies. But over time the shop, owned by Brigit and William Peat, grew its line of wirelesses and televisions and, as the years passed, it became the place keen eared Dubliners went to buy high-end hi-fi systems, speakers and other electronic wizardry.In 2012, it announced it was closing, blaming the recession and the impact of online retailers. What followed was an outpouring of apparently genuine goodwill from the public. It prompted the Peat family to reopen the Parnell Street store. The goodwill might have been genuine but it did not appear to be backed by any real commitment on the part of consumers to actually spend money in the shop they claimed to love. A year later that Parnell Street shop closed for good.While it traded on Dublin’s North Earl Street for more than 100 years and had many loyal customers, Boyers often struggled with an image problem and in latter years was almost universally described as the “unfashionable older sister” in the Arnotts group. In truth, it was always a bit bargain basement.“High class dressmaking, moderate charges,” started one of its front page ads in this newspaper in 1899. Fast forward five years and it opened its “new boot and shoe department for reliable and serviceable footwear for ladies, gentlemen and children”. While it may have been reliable, it was never glamorous or on the cutting edge of fashion. It trundled on for many decades before eventually closing its doors in early 2016. It is now a SportsDirect outlet.Clerys was at Dublin’s heart on O’Connell Street and had a history dating back to May 1853, when McSwiney, Delany and Co opened what they called “Palatial Mart” or the “New Mart”.“Housed in a purpose-built building, the department store was designed to eclipse European outlets of the time. The shop was renamed 30 years later when it was taken over by Michael J Clery of Limerick. From 1883 to the present day, Clery and Co has hung over the doors,” author Joseph EA Connell wrote in a book focusing on Dublin in 1916 which was published ahead of the centenary of the Easter Rising.Clerys had the dubious honour of being one of the first buildings to be set on fire. “I had the extraordinary experience of seeing the plate-glass windows of Clerys run molten into the channel from the terrific heat,” Oscar Traynor wrote. The shop moved for a spell to Lower Abbey Street but returned to its rebuilt home in the 1920s.It oddly became one of the most romantic sites in Dublin. “The scene of many a romantic evening, the ballroom at Clerys saw dances hosted every night of the week with a full-time orchestra,” the Clerys website used to read.“The romance spread and it wasn’t long before gentlemen would ask their ladies to meet them ‘under Clerys clock’. The phrase soon became equally, if not more, famous than the store itself, and meeting under Clerys clock cemented the store as an institutional part of Dublin culture.”All that was true but not even the clock could stop what happened next. The company, which had been in decline for many years, was bought in 2012 for €13.6 million by a US-based private equity group, in a bank receivership sale. It was sold again to Irish property groups D2 Private and UK-based Cheyney Capital three years later and, within hours, the new owners had applied to the High Court to have a liquidator appointed on the grounds that Clerys’ operating company was unable to pay its debts. This meant that minimum statutory redundancy would be paid to the 460 workers who received just hours of notice before the locks were changed and the shop closed for good.It is not hard to imagine what James Larkin, who once addressed a rally from its balcony, would have made of that.This shop was once a retailing colossus and business was so good during the war years that its owner, Denis Guiney, was able to rescue Clerys by buying it out of receivership for £250,000. At that time, Guineys had the bigger turnover and it was thanks to Denis Guiney that Clerys became a retail star in Dublin again.He set it up as an affordable and dependable supplier of clothes for the middle classes which is what Guineys \u0026amp Co had been too. He died in 1967 and his widow, Mary, remained chairwoman of Clery \u0026amp Co until her death, aged 103, in 2004.Guineys \u0026amp Co’s sorry end came when its by then much bigger relation closed suddenly in 2015. Confusingly, there is an entirely different Guineys on the same street that remains open.Not the only bookseller to fall by the wayside giants such as Waterstones and Hughes \u0026amp Hughes and old favourites like Fred Hanna’s also disappeared as have hundreds of other small bookshops as well as countless second-hand shops.But Greene’s on Dublin’s Clare Street – just across from the old Finn’s Hotel which had a special place in James Joyce’s heart because it was where Nora Barnacle worked – was old old school.There was the book-lined staircase, leading up to rooms crammed with old tomes. And the glass canopy and the tables of books left outside come rain or shine in summer and winter.It started out as a book shop and lending library in 1843 and given its name by the then owner John Greene. Herbert H Pembrey took over in 1912 and his family owned it until the end came in 2007 with much of the business moving online and operating out of a premises in the less evocative surroundings of Sandyford.With a history stretching back to the 1750, this small building with a most memorable facade was one of the oldest shops in Dublin before being sold to the pub next door on College Street in 2018.It sold yeast – obviously – and all manner of cake-decorating paraphernalia and stepping through its doors was as close to time travel as anyone lucky enough to visit before the doors closed for the last time was likely to get.The business first opened in 1894 in what had been the foyer of the George Hotel, which later became a bank and later still the Westin Hotel.The Moreland family took over the business in the 1930s and John Moreland started work there when he left school at 16 in the early 1940s. He was still behind the counter, aged 91, in 2015. After he died, the shop closed and the building was eventually sold and is currently being redeveloped.Personal memoriesHere are just some of the memories received by our readers over recent days.Greene’s bookshop, with all of its nooks and crannies, was such a sad loss.

Video: UK Parliament TV\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSpeaker John Bercow announce that he will stand down during an impassioned speech in the House of Commons, London on Monday. Photograph: House of CommonsPA WireJohn Bercow has announced that he will stand down as Commons Speaker at the end of next month unless an election is called beforehand.In an impassioned speech Mr Bercow, who has held the influential post for just over 10 years, also said he would step down as MP for Buckingham.The speaker told the Commons he would resign on Monday night in the unlikely event MPs vote for an early general election, but said if they did not he would stand aside on October 31st.As his wife Sally looked on from the gallery, Mr Bercow said: “At the 2017 election, I promised my wife and children that it would be my last.“This is a pledge that I intend to keep. If the House votes tonight for an early general election, my tenure as Speaker and MP will end when this Parliament ends.“If the House does not so vote, I have concluded that the least disruptive and most democratic course of action would be for me to stand down at the close of business on Thursday October 31st.”He continued: “Least disruptive because that date will fall shortly after the votes on the Queen’s Speech expected on October 21st and 22nd.“The week or so after that may be quite lively and it would be best to have an experienced figure in the chair for that short period.“Most democratic because it will mean that a ballot is held when all members have some knowledge of the candidates.“This is far preferable to a contest at the beginning of a parliament when new MPs will not be similarly informed and may find themselves vulnerable to undue institutional influence.”The Speaker added that he has “sought to be the backbenchers’ backstop”, and thanked his team in the Speaker’s House for their work behind the scenes.Mr Bercow entered Parliament in 1997 and held several shadow ministerial positions before taking the Speaker’s chair on June 22nd 2009, promising to serve “no more than nine years in total”.He abandoned that commitment ahead of the 2017 snap election, but allegations of bullying by former members of his staff, denied by the Speaker, led to fresh calls for him to quit.Controversial rulingsIn recent months he has also come under fire for a series of controversial rulings in the chamber which were widely considered to favour Remain supporters.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn praised Mr Bercow for being a “superb” Speaker, and said he had “totally changed the way in which the job has been done”.“This Parliament is stronger for your being Speaker. Our democracy is the stronger for your being the Speaker.“And whatever you do when you finally step down from Parliament, you do so with the thanks of a very large number of people,” Mr Corbyn said.For the Government, Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Michael Gove said it was clear Mr Bercow loved the House of Commons and democracy, adding: “Your commitment to your principles and to your constituents is unwavering and an example to others.”Mr Gove joked that he hoped Mr Bercow would not take it personally when he votes for an early general election, adding: “It is the case that however controversial the role of the backstop may be in other areas, your role as the backbenchers’ backstop has certainly been one that’s been appreciated by iniduals across this House.”However Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage tweeted “good riddance” in response to Mr Bercow’s announcement.Deputy speaker Lindsay Hoyle confirmed he would stand to replace Mr Bercow.He tweeted: “Now that there is a vacancy for the Office of Speaker of the House of Commons, I am happy to confirm that I will be standing as a candidate.”Mr Hoyle also paid tribute to Mr Bercow’s “dedication and service”, saying: “He is a champion of LGBT and BAME rights and we now have a more erse and representative House than ever before.”Veteran Tory MP Sir Edward Leigh also confirmed his intention to stand to replace Mr Bercow, while Labour’s Chris Bryant has previously put his hat in the ring.ParliamentElsewhere, the British parliament will be prorogued at the close of business on Monday, Downing Street has confirmed.The prime minister’s official spokesman said that while the government would obey the law, Mr Johnson would not be requesting another extension of the Article 50 EU withdrawal process.“The prime minister is not going to seek an extension,” the spokesman said.“If MPs want to resolve this there is an easy way – vote for an election today and let the public decide.”\u0026nbspThe Conservative Party leader flew to Ireland to meet with Taoiseach Leo Varadkar on Monday morning but his counterpart poured cold water on suggestions of a breakthrough on the stalemate over a solution to the Irish backstop, the safety net agreed by the European Union and the UK to avoid a hard border in Northern Ireland.Royal approvalBritain’s Queen Elizabeth gave final approval to a piece of legislation which seeks to prevent prime minister Boris Johnson from taking the country out of the European Union without a deal on October 31st.The step, known as Royal Assent, is effectively a rubber-stamp from the monarch for the law which passed through parliament last week despite opposition from the government.The Royal Assent was announced in parliament’s upper chamber, the House of Lords. – PA and ReutersDeal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

But why?The company is preparing to launch its iPhone at a major event on its campus in Cupertino. Much of the world\u0027s press has been flown out to gaze upon the latest slabs of glass and metal the company is preparing to put on sale – not just the new phone, but probably new Apple Watches and other products too.From the outside, however, that annual migration might all seem a little strange. So here is the rundown on why all of that is happening – and whether it really matters.Somewhere between a press conference and a fashion show, Apple events are really just a long presentation in which Apple shows off its new products, and tries to convince you that they\u0027re worth buying.Executives will get up on stage, boast about the performance of the latest products, show off some pictures of the products and probably the products themselves, and then head back off stage again.Created with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.125 Gun-toting humanoid robot sent into spaceRussia has launched a humanoid robot into space on a rocket bound for the International Space Station (ISS).

Sometimes there will be one or two extra at some point in year.Why new iPhone won\u0027t be biggest announcement from Apple eventYes, almost entirely. The iPhone event is always Apple\u0027s most product focused event, and in recent years those iPhones have been getting more and more expensive.But you\u0027ll get something out of the event even if your wallet (and your old iPhone) stays in your pocket. Apple should also announce the release date for its new iOS 13 operating system, which will bring new features to older devices too, for free.Apple has gradually made it easier to watch with each passing year. As such, this is the easiest yet.Chief among the reasons is the fact that the company is finally putting the live stream on YouTube. That is undoubtedly the easiest way to watch.But it\u0027s also offering people the chance to watch along in a variety of other ways, too.For all the details on watching live click here.The events can be long – sometimes very long. And while there\u0027s lots of spectacular goings on to fill the time, there can also be a lot of bits that aren\u0027t really necessary to watch in detail.Most likely, you already know if you\u0027re going to be watching along: if you want to know everything about the new phone, and everything else as soon as you can, then it\u0027s definitely worth catching. If those things aren\u0027t true, and you\u0027re not , then watch along after.You\u0027ll still be able to get all of the same information if you watch after – Apple always posts the full keynote online afterwards. And that has the advantage of letting you skip through any parts that aren\u0027t especially thrilling.No, probably not. It\u0027s likely that the iPhone and any other products won\u0027t actually arrive for a couple of weeks, as is usual, to give them time to arrive at the Apple Store.What will happen soon after the event is that pre-orders will open, giving people the chance to put down money for the new phone. In previous years, that was incredibly important – but lately, and especially when the new phones are relatively similar, it\u0027s been much easier to get hold of an iPhone quickly without pre-ordering.Apple will also start giving the phones to those members of the press that it invites to its events. They will then write up reviews a few days after, giving the first real glimpse of whether the phones and other products live up to the promises made during the keynote.For all the details on the release date, click here.Like the current one, mostly. It will have an extra lens in the camera, and perhaps some more colours, but otherwise it will look identical.That applies to all three of the current models, which will be replicated in the current line-up, though they are expected to take different names. The iPhone XR will become the iPhone 11 the XS is rumoured to be known as the iPhone 11 Pro the XS Max is said to be the iPhone 11 Pro Max.The bigger changes are likely to happen on the inside.

A\u0026nbsp(non-fashionable) fashion retailer with food, or\u0026nbspa non-essential food seller with fashion?Click to followThe IndependentNothing lasts forever. Of course, I know that. But for someone who grew up in a family that, like many, worshipped at the altar of St Michael, the fall of Marks and Spencer and its brand still comes as a shock.Our clothes were M\u0026ampS, our food was M\u0026ampS, my father even bought my mother shares in the chain – so much did we pour into its tills. For many years, until the arrival of an Asda, it was the only shop of any serious presence in the town. There was a Boots and a Tesco, but they were nothing compared to the Marks, sitting as it did in the plum position in the main shopping street. Now that branch has just closed, and coincidentally or not, M\u0026ampS has dropped out of the FTSE100.There’s a huge Tesco, an Aldi, a Lidl, a Morrisons, and still, the Asda. But the once grand M\u0026ampS lies empty. Meanwhile, the company that was the first retailer to break through the £1bn profits barrier, no longer ranks among the country’s biggest 100 stock market-listed concerns. It’s a sad, sorry state of affairs. And once unthinkable.There were early clues as to what was coming. The M\u0026ampS was on two floors but even I, as a schoolboy, noticed that hardly anyone went upstairs. They just didn’t. Every so often the manager would try selling something different up there\u0026nbspand it didn’t matter. The escalator would continue to whirr upwards, devoid of passengers.M\u0026ampS would have one colour of sock in all sizes but not the hue you wanted. Likewise, with shirts, plenty of a certain variety, but lacking in others. Clearly, the group had an issue with its supply lines.Marks and Spencer to be relegated from FTSE 100As Tesco moved to the other side of town, to giant premises with lots of free parking, the contrast between the venerable M\u0026ampS, stuck in the town centre amid tight streets with double yellow lines, and the once budget purveyor now transformed, thanks to a dynamic management superbly led, first by Ian MacLaurin then by Terry Leahy, could not be more marked. Tesco always had what you were looking for, its lorries were forever unloading their wares, the firm’s skill was in perfecting just-in-time delivery. M\u0026ampS started to appear outdated, and where fashion was concerned, outmoded.Along came Next, offering much as an alternative shopping experience, then a lot more with the launch of its mail order catalogue. This giant book soon became a staple in middle-class homes. We didn’t know so at the time but it allowed Next to perfect warehousing and logistical systems and was a precursor to the onset of online.M\u0026ampS was snooty about Next, as it was about any aspect involving so-called competitors. They could dream up as many gimmicks as they wished, but it, M\u0026ampS, was the bellwether of the high street, the prime tenant in any decent new development, the great name that all others aspired to. It would not be side-tracked by the rest.That feeling of detachment was confirmed by a visit to the old M\u0026ampS headquarters in London’s Baker Street. Going there was like entering a section of the civil service, with long corridors, and closed doors with numbers on them. There was a sense of anonymity, of people doing their jobs, but minus any passion and creativity. There was no collective buzz, no evidence of urgent energy.Its staff were famously treated better than anyone else’s, enjoying all manner of benefits and perks. But instead of encouraging them to be daring and think the impossible, it merely fuelled a corporate smugness.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But while M\u0026ampS was bedding down, other retailers were motoring – creating new ranges, finessing their internet services.In clothing,\u0026nbspH\u0026ampM and Zara were producing brighter, modern items, (along with Topshop they were known for fast\u0026nbspfashion, a phrase that was never applied to M\u0026ampS) while Primark was undercutting on price. Even Asda chipped away with its George range, providing essentials for less.In food, Waitrose and Tesco Premium matched M\u0026ampS at the top end, with Aldi and Lidl showing what could be bought for a fraction, without a significant drop in quality, at the other.M\u0026ampS dallied with homeware, but against John Lewis, which long ago stole its hegemony as the company-to-look-towards for indications of economic buoyancy. While John Lewis\u0026nbspbecame the anchor that shopping centre managers and online specialist suppliers craved,\u0026nbspM\u0026ampS failed to excite.Successive managements tried to steer the ship. None succeeded in arresting the drift. Increasingly, M\u0026ampS seemed not to know what it was: a (non-fashionable) fashion retailer with food a non-essential food seller with fashion.In its latest incarnation, the leadership team of chairman Archie Norman and chief executive Steve Rowe is probably the best M\u0026ampS has had for a while. They know their stuff.But Norman and Rowe have inherited a bloated vessel, one with too many stores in the wrong places, and not enough high-tech knowhow and resource to pack a punch on the internet. They should be striking out with newness and innovation\u0026nbspbut instead they’re forced to devote too much time and energy to cutting and fighting fires.Ejection from the FTSE100 is further evidence of that contracting business. M\u0026ampS’s downward spiral continues.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Minds Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Minds.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

John Hibbard, then in his late twenties, had sailed out to Rottnest Island, off Perth, Western Australia, and was windsurfing the best waves of his life in Stark Bay. The sun smiled down on him out of a clear blue sky and a 20-knot wind and 10ft swell propelled him across wave after immaculate wave. Finally satisfied and exhausted, knocking back an ice-cold Corona, he realised it could never get better than this. But the thought occurred to him: what am I going to do with the rest of my life? The answer to that question was\u0026nbspRed Paddle Co, of which he is co-founder and CEO.We had a plan, John Hibbard and I, to take out a couple of his stand-up paddleboards (or SUPs) and ride them along the River Dart in Devon, stop somewhere for lunch and paddle back. It would have been idyllic. The only problem was that it was pelting with rain all day, which put a bit of a dampener on the idea. But at least he had more time to show me around his dedicated new headquarters near Totnes on the south coast with a view out over Dartmoor.Hibbard was British windsurfing champion in 2008. He was born in Basingstoke but brought up in Devon. He windsurfed around the world, from Maui to Tahiti, from the Caribbean to the Indian Ocean, sponsored by Nissan and Fat Face, and getting photographed while doing it. He loved the technical challenge, mastering the equipment, no matter how gnarly the conditions. It sounds like the dream life. And it was, but there were a couple of downsides. One was that it was lonely: his only friends were also his rivals so he couldn’t hang out with them. The other was the sheer amount of kit. Hibbard recalls once checking in 50 bags at an airport (admittedly he was carrying stuff for a friend too).After becoming British champion, and sustaining various injuries along the way, he was looking for something new. “I thought there must be more to life on the beach.” Then one day he was doing a photoshoot in Harlyn Bay and there was no wind and he said:\u0026nbsp“I’ve got this paddleboard thing in the back of the car.” A friend had told him about it but he’d never tried it before. He paddled out and caught a wave and rode it all the way to the beach. The shot made a double-page spread in the magazines. He had found the solution, not just for the lack of wind, but of what to do with his life.He took the board out on a river and he realised two things: one, that it was easy for someone who had never been on a board before to pick it up – it didn’t need the kind of dedication required by surfing or windsurfing. And secondly that it opened up a totally different perspective on the world.“I’d lived around that river for years, but I’d never been up it before,” he says.\u0026nbsp“I was seeing things I’d never seen before. So many trees, a kiln, an old pub. And standing up you have a better view than from a kayak.” He had been all around the world but all he ever saw was beaches and airports. With the paddleboard you didn’t need wind and you didn’t need waves. This was “the bicycle of the water” – the ideal leisure craft of the future. And it was sociable: you could go out with friends, you weren’t competing for wave of the day. It wasn’t extreme, but it was an experience.Stand-up paddleboard originated in Hawaii. For hundred of years people had been standing on boards and using paddle power to punt them from island to island. Then Laird Hamilton, big-wave surfer extraordinaire, based in Maui, adopted and glamorised them in the early Noughties. Hollywood stars could be seen riding them on the west coast. But the reality is that they were huge, unwieldy, and vulnerable to dings.\u0026nbspHibbard, fired up with enthusiasm, first of all tried his hand at selling them around the country. But it was, as he says wryly, “a slow burn”. Windsurfing shops had shrunk in size along with windsurfing boards and sails and they didn’t have the space for these bigger ones. By chance, Hibbard came across an inflatable board, made in South Korea for an American company, and he realised that this was the future.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Red Paddle Co Paddleboard: The bicycle of the water Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.But the future didn’t happen overnight. The Korean manufacturer made him a board but it wasn’t great. For one thing Hibbard was too out of breath after pumping it up to come out with a decent sales spiel. And for another the board itself was too spongy, more like an airbed or a lilo than a proper board. “It was a great idea but badly executed,” he says. Which is what inspired him to come up with his new mission statement: it has to be authentic. Without compromise. The board has to be a real board.Hibbard asked an old friend of his, a surfer and animator, to design him a logo. His designer friend told him that he needed a name before he could have a logo. He realised that he’d done everything but he still didn’t have a name for the company. They were sitting on the beach in Woolacombe watching the sun go down and Hibbard looked into the sunset and said, “There it is: red – red sky at night.”\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Everything collapses down so that it’s portable and it all goes in a custom-designed bag (wheels or backpack). The pump is now double-barrelled and takes half the time with half the effort. And when the board is inflated there’s a patented stiffening system to make it as rigid as the old foam and fibre glass but even more robust with a double skin and dimpled surface. I inspected their boards and I can confirm – having paddleboarded in Hawaii – they look and feel like real boards. They don’t bend. (Check out YouTube, where they have a 22-ton JCB grinding over one with no ill effects.) Everything is designed and engineered by Red and produced in house, using a 3D\u0026nbspprinter for the smallest parts.\u0026nbspNow they’re exporting thousands of boards to 60 countries around the world – selling them even in Hawaii, which feels like carrying coals to Newcastle. “Customers do the selling for us,” says Hibbard. And there is a blind paddleboarder called Dean Dunbar in Scotland riding a Red paddleboard. Mission accomplished.John Hibbard had one stroke of genius. When he took people out on an SUP for the first time they fell in love with it but then they would say, pointing at the nose, “What’s that?” And he would say, “That’s the valve.” And they would go (with an air of deflation), “Oh, really?” So he simply moved the valve from the front of the board to the back. Now nobody even notices it’s inflatable. Until he shows them. And they go, “Wow, I don’t believe it!Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Minds Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Minds.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

While bank has sought to reassure that it will have sufficient capital to pay its idend, its share buy back programme (another means of returning capital to investors) has been suspended.\u0026nbspThat had been helping to prop up the share price of late.Big investors suffering fall out from this, even if it’s limited, is a very welcome development.\u0026nbspFew of them raised any questions\u0026nbspwhen banks were aggressively selling millions of worthless PPI policies, despite the fact that\u0026nbspthe profit margins on them were so wildly out of whack when compared to other insurance policies that\u0026nbspit ought to have raised alarm bells.\u0026nbspInstitutional shareholders, with a time horizon longer than a few months, should have been asking how those sort of margins were produced and whether they were sustainable.

It also wants UK state-educated pupils to make up 69.1 per cent of its intake by 2024-25.But Chris Millward, director for fair access and participation at the OfS, said some universities still had a “very long way to go” to improve representation, adding there is still “deep inequality”.Of the initial group of 41 universities who have now published their access and participation plans, 31 will be subject to “enhanced monitoring” by the regulator. \u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailUniversities may face fines of £500,000 as regulator given more powersThis will include additional reporting requirements on commitments made in the plans, specific actions to address areas of weakness, requirements to change plans, or further interventions.Mr Millward said: “We will be monitoring closely and will be ready to step in if we don’t see universities making progress.\u0026nbspGiven the starting point for Oxford and Cambridge was 14 to 15 times as many students from the most elite, advantaged groups, they are inevitably going to be high on our list in relation to access.”Data from the OfS shows that young students from disadvantaged areas are more likely to drop out, less likely to gain a first or 2.1, or find employment compared to their more advantaged peers.In 2017-18 there was a difference of 23 per cent between the proportion of white and black students achieving a first or 2.1, figures show.Mr Millward added: “This is not just about meeting short term targets, but the first steps in a generational shift towards a fairer higher education system and a fairer society.\u0026nbspWe are still a long way from equality of opportunity in our universities, and gaps remain particularly wide at the most selective universities.“We expect universities and colleges to address these issues at all parts of the student life cycle – including admissions, attainment and successful progression beyond higher education.\u0026nbspWe will be scrutinising the progress universities make and will intervene where progress is not sufficient.”On the 31 universities receiving enhanced monitoring, Dr Luke Heselwood, from Reform think tank, said it was “deeply concerning” that so many top universities have been put on “special measures”.He added: “The OfS is right to require that elite universities produce and publish access plans, but these figures show a disconnect between ambition and reality.\u0026nbspUniversities cannot argue that this is a money issue. Reform research found that access spending reached £745m in 2016-17. It is essential that this money is well spent.”Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said: “The doors to our universities need be as wide open as possible, so that anyone with talent and potential has the chance to benefit from our world-leading institutions and become best version of themselves they can be.\u0026nbspThese access and participation plans will play a vital part in making this happen, but now we need to see that action take place – and quickly. As a society we cannot let this wasted potential go unchecked a minute longer.He added: “I am clear to universities that this is not just about widening access but also helping to tackle drop-out rates and improving attainment and progression from higher education.\u0026nbspI will be watching carefully to see how these plans are now delivered and I will support the OfS in any action it takes if universities are not delivering against their commitments.”Office for Students\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Minds Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Minds.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

The Pink Meanie was discovered during a nightlight jellyfish e by the collections team in the waters around Robben Island and in Cape Town Harbour. Pink Meanies are jellyvorous, meaning they feed on other jelly species by reeling them in with their long tentacles. Discovering the Pink Meanie in its early ephyra stage meant the team could study its growth rate which turned out to be very quick as it grew to the metaephyra stage in about a week and a half. The Mexican pink meanie (Drymonema larsoni) was only discovered in the year 2000. A Mediterranean relative, known as the Big Pink Jellyfish (Drymonema dalmatinum) has been known to science since the 1800s but when spotted in 2014 it had been almost 70 years since the last sighting.

The Pink Meanie was discovered during a nightlight jellyfish e by the collections team in the waters around Robben Island and in Cape Town Harbour.

Discovering the Pink Meanie in its early ephyra stage meant the team could study its growth rate which turned out to be very quick as it grew to the metaephyra stage in about a week and a half.

Yet few are likely to have as much inspiration to draw on as India-born, Zimbabwe-raised and now Peckham-based artist Rina Mushonga.On Deerhunter’s eighth album, frontman Bradford Cox takes on the role of war poet, documenting the things he observes with a cool matter-of-factness, and heart-wrenching detail. Death is everywhere on Why Hasn’t Everything Already Disappeared?, as much as others may refuse to see it.After a period of tumult, Sharon Van Etten’s fifth album is a reinvention. But beneath its hazy synths and electronics are songs of endurance and inner peace, of settling after a flurry of activity. 460 Bring Me the Horizon  – AmoBMTH frontman Oli Sykes wants to assert the fragility of the boundary between love and hate. Amo is a way of exploring that, even down to the title itself.560 Nina Nesbitt – The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will ChangeNesbitt is back with her second LP, switching to a brand of soul and R\u0026ampB-fused pop that feels bang on time, and suits her far better. The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will Change has slick, polished production from Fraser T Smith (Adele), Lostboy (Anne-Marie), Jordan Riley (Zara Larsson), and Nesbitt herself.This self-titled record, a loose but beautifully crafted collection of folk-rock songs, explores the kinds of anxieties intrinsic to the modern age – the longing to be at once noticed and invisible the paralysing effects of limitless information, and the desire to do good versus the desire to be seen doing good.The album is packed with personal confessions for the fans – “Arianators” – to pick over. It lacks a centrepiece to match the arresting depth and space of Sweetener’s “God Is A Woman”, but Grande handles its shifting moods and cast of producers (including pop machines Max Martin and Tommy Brown) with engaging class and momentum. One minute you’re skanking along to the party brass of “Bloodline” the next floating into the semi-detached, heartbreak of “Ghostin’”, which appears to address Grande’s guilt at being with Davidson while pining for Miller. She sings of the late rapper as a “wingless angel” with featherlight high notes that will drop the sternest jaw. (Helen Brown)The perma-brilliant James Blake has flooded his fourth album – Assume Form – with euphoric sepia soul and loved-up doo-wop. His trademark intelligence, honesty and pin-drop production remain intact. But the detached chorister vocals of a decade in which he battled depression have thawed to reveal a millennial Sam Cooke crooning: “Can’t believe the way we flow, way we flow, way we flow...”While he recognises his roots and includes plenty of nods to grime, AJ Tracey\u0027s magpie’s eye for a good melody or hook extends far beyond that. With the help of stellar producers like Cadenza (Kiko Bun), Swifta Beater (Kano, Giggs), and Nyge (Section Boyz, Yxng Bane), Tracey incorporates electronic music, rock, garage and even country on his most cohesive work to date.The album title of the year gives us an image of Brexit Britain trashed by Old Etonians David Cameron, Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg, but the fifth studio work from the punk duo has more than social commentary to offer. There’s some of that, as vocalist Jason Williamson skewers documentary-makers who take advantage of the poor in “Kebab Spider” – “the skint get used in loo roll shoes” – but elsewhere this is a record that expands the idea of what Sleaford Mods could be.“Do you still have that photograph? Would you use it to hurt me?” asks Australian indie rocker Julia Jacklin, against the menacing throb of “Body”. The tension is stormy: imagine a mid-period Fleetwood Mac song, covered by Cat Power. It’s a masterclass in narrative songwriting.With praise from Kendrick Lamar, five EPs released by the time she was 21, tours with Lauryn Hill, collaborations with Gorillaz and two critically praised albums – including 2017’s excellent concept album Stillness in Wonderland – fans and critics alike wondered what else Little Simz could do to find the kind of mainstream success enjoyed by so many of her male peers.1360 Solange – When I Get HomeSolange Knowles has never been coy about the intent behind her music. Beautiful arrangements and seamless production notwithstanding, you get the sense, each time she drop a project, that it serves a distinct, zeitgeist-shifting purpose.1460 Foals – Everything Not Saved Will be Lost (Part 1)FoalsMerging their asymmetrical early math pop with the deep space atmospherics of Total Life Forever and Holy Fire, plus added innovations – ambient rainforest throbs on “Moonlight”, deadpan EDM on “In Degrees”, Afro-glitch Radiohead on “Café D’Athens” – they’ve created an inspired album of scorched earth new music that, in all likelihood, will only really be challenged for album of the year by Part 2. (Mark Beaumont)Tracks are at once astute and deeply personal in how they capture vignettes of everyday life and spin them into important lessons. “Black”, the most recent single from the record, considers what that word means to different people around the world, as well as to Dave. “Voices” has him singing over an old-school garage beat, fighting off personal demons.At her best, Sigrid throws out precision-tooled high notes like icicle javelins into vast, blue Scandi-produced skies. Then she growls like an Icelandic volcano preparing to disrupt western civilisation until we sort ourselves out.1760 Karen O and Danger Mouse – Lux PrimaLux Prima was born just over a decade ago from a drunken phone call from Karen O to Danger Mouse – real name Brian Joseph Burton – during which the pair vowed they would work on something together. It wasn’t until after O had given birth to her son, though, that recording finally began, and there is a beatific sense of contentment on songs like “Drown”, with its Kamasi Washington-like choirs and stately horns.This is an ambitious creation, meticulously crafted and assembled. For a start, the range of guest performers is a cornucopia of contemporary soul and hip-hop collaborators: vocalists Moses Sumney, Roots Manuva, Heidi Vogel, Grey Reverend and Tawiah strings player Miguel Atwood-Ferguson, and keyboardist Dennis Hamm – both of whom have worked with Flying Lotus and Thundercat.Rose – who found fame in the UK’s indie-folk scene as an unofficial member of Bombay Bicycle Club in 2010, only to walk away amid the band’s growing hype – is darkly compelling on No Words Left. Assisted by producer Tim Bidwell, who worked on Rose’s last record Something’s Changing, she sounds braver than she ever has before. There are moments that recall her Communion labelmate Ben Howard, on his latest album, Noonday Dream, and others that nod to the quiet stoicism of Joni Mitchell and Neil Young. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)The record is loosely conceptual insomuch as it’s punctuated with mock adverts for “WWAY HEALTH, our 247 care programme”. But don’t be put off: Miss Universe is a brilliant collection of songs, an expansive melange of indie, jazz, pop and trip-hop that flits between a lo-fi sparseness and something The Strokes would play. Yanya – who is of Turkish-Irish-Bajan heritage – grew up in London on a mix of Pixies, Nina Simone, The Libertines and Amy Winehouse, and this unlikely combination is certainly reflected in the sound. (Patrick Smith)2160 Jenny Lewis – On the LineHere, Lewis does what she does best: adds the glossy sparkle of Hollywood and a sunny Californian sheen to melancholy and nostalgia, with her most luxuriantly orchestrated album yet. Even when she’s singing, “I’ve wasted my youth”, it’s in that sweet voice, with carefree “doo doo doo doo doo doos”, and at a pace that’s so upbeat that it masks the sentiment. It’s a bittersweet mourning of her past. (Elisa Bray)Comprising songs from Segall’s eclectic (that’s putting it lightly) catalogue and performed by him and the Freedom Band (Mikal Cronin, Charles Moothart, Emmett Kelly, and Ben Boye), the album is delightfully short and sweet. It is certainly a drastic switch-up from Freedom’s Goblin (2018), which had 19 tracks and ran for 75 minutes.If you want to know how hard it is to categorise Titanic Rising – the enthralling fourth album from Weyes Blood – look no further than the American musician’s own attempt to do so. It is, she says, “The Kinks meet the Second World War, or Bob Seger meets Enya.”Tension aside, there’s a great sense of fun here. The title track is pure euphoria, as restless synths of a Utah Saints or Orbital rave break into swelling bass and melody. And they create the full club experience with “Got to Keep On”, on which the four-to-the-floor beat, funky rhythm guitar, sweet backing vocals and chiming bells make way for the simple sounds of happy party-goers just as the anticipation builds, so does the instrumentation into a hypnotic crescendo. It’s masterful production. (Elisa Bray)Six months after the release of Oxnard, Anderson .Paak returns with another Dr Dre-produced record, Ventura. Where the former was overflowing with choppy, experimental sounds, guest appearances and clumsy attempts at Gil Scott Heron-esque revolutionary lyrics, the sequel – recorded around the same time – streamlines .Paak’s sound, making for a tightly packaged, melodic and danceable album.Two years after the release of his Mercury Prize-nominated debut Yesterday’s Gone, the south London hip-hop artist unveils its follow-up, Not Waving, But Drowning. And if any two records could portray how quickly someone can grow from a boy to a man, it’s these.2760 Lizzo – Cuz I Love YouNo one could accuse Lizzo of holding back. Not when it comes to her voice – which is raw and rowdy, so laden with personality even the vulnerable moments are a joy to listen to –  and certainly not when it comes to her message of unabashed self-love. That’s the predominant theme of the singer  rapper  flautist-extraordinaire’s hugely likeable third album, Cuz I Love You.It seems as likely as Old Man Steptoe dining with the Rees-Mogg, but this new tactic of burying their confrontational gruesomeness beneath a veneer of alt-rock respectability for album three works well for Fat White Family. Drenched in chamber strings and celestial harmonies, the plush yet sinister “Oh Sebastian” could be Pet Sounds selling its soul to the devil. “Fringe Runner” is so sleek and funksome it could be a New Romantic “White Lines (Don’t Don’t Do It)” “Kim’s Sunsets” is a piece of refined cosmic reggae resembling a blissed-out “Bankrobber”.2960 Cage the Elephant – Social CuesOn Cage the Elephant’s fifth album, Social Cues, frontman Matt Shultz reacts to the breakdown of his marriage and the loss of three close friends. He undergoes a kind of Jekyll and Hyde transition through the 13 tracks, the result of which is the band’s best work to date.SOAK reaches to outsiders once again on her new album. 3160 The Cranberries – In the EndThere’s a cruel irony that the release of The Cranberries’ final album should come just a week after journalist Lyra McKee was shot dead by the New IRA during a riot in Londonderry. “Zombie” was a protest song written by the band’s late frontwoman Dolores O’Riordan after two children were killed by IRA bombs – was released. She was deeply affected by the deaths, and would no doubt have been devastated by recent events in Northern Ireland as well.On her third record, Aldous Harding combines the gothic folk of her self-titled 2014 debut with the dramatically intimate tones of her follow-up album Party.Big Thief’s frontwoman Adrianne Lenker has an uncanny ability to make you feel like you’re in on a secret. Her whispering, spectral delivery and deeply personal lyrics are the key to this. Even on the band’s third album UFOF, with an audience that has grown exponentially in the past few years, the songs are still immensely intimate affairs.On his debut album, the 24-year-old Collard mixes sultry jams that recall the electronic funk of MGMT with nods to the greats: Prince, James Brown, Led Zeppelin and Marvin Gaye. Throughout, Collard exhibits his extraordinary voice, which swoops to a devilishly low murmur or soars to an ecstatic falsetto.   Dedicated covers the full, but generic, spectrum of relationships: dizzying love, lust, and break-ups. But whether she’s pining for the return of a former love in the funky disco banger “Julien”, or singing about masturbating post-break-up in lead single “Party For One” (“I’ll be the one If you don’t care about me Making love to myself Back on my beat”), the vibe remains positively jubilant.Getty Images for Spotify3660 Tyler, the Creator - IGOR“I don’t know where I’m going,” Tyler, the Creator begins on the song “I THINK”. “But I know what I’m showing.” The US artist’s words ring true throughout his fifth studio album, IGOR, where he adopts the dark and twisted mutterings of the Frankenstein character from which the record gets its name. It’s been a long wait for Flying Lotus’s new album. In fact, the LA producer has been masterminding Flamagra for the past five years – snatching moments between collaborating with Kendrick Lamar on To Pimp a Butterfly, directing and writing the comic horror movie Kuso, producing much of Thundercat’s Drunk and growing his Brainfeeder label.A heftier sound is never at the cost of melody, which shines through in Thomson’s vocals, the rest of the band’s backing falsetto, and the searing blues grooves stamped all over Future Dust. Those qualities are captured nowhere more satisfyingly than on “25”. “All Over Town” is their singalong anthem, neatly positioned in the middle to ease the pace.In keeping with the relatively restrained guest spots, it’s heartening just how much Skepta has rejected overloading Ignorance is Bliss with high-profile producers, preferring instead to burrow into his own aesthetic. There’s no attempt to chase someone else’s wave here no token drill, afroswing or trap beats to satisfy playlist algorithms. Instead, his cold grime sonics are rendered down to their no-frills essentials – brutalist blocks of sad angular melodies and hard, spacious drums.Bruce Springsteen seems to have told almost every tale in the grand old storybook of American mythologies, except perhaps one: a wide-eyed Californian dreamer finds the Golden State turns sour and flees back east, to some romantic speck of a town, to pine and rehabilitate. It’s the classic pop plotline of Bacharach and David’s “Do You Know the Way to San Jose?”, and it’s a tale Springsteen taps repeatedly here, on his sumptuous, cinematic 19th album, which is nothing short of a late-period masterpiece.A revolving door of female vocalists (A-listers, indie darlings like Angel Olsen and unsung songwriters) deliver heartbroken lines over big, shiny beats and synths. The emotional cohesion the record loses in its shifting cast of singerssongwritersgenres it makes up in DJ-savvy textural variety. Help Us Stranger reaches all corners of guitar rock: funky Detroit garage (“What’s Yours Is Mine”) country soul (“Somedays (I Don’t Feel Like Trying)”) psych (a cover of Donovan’s “Hey Gyp (Dig the Slowness)”) blues and bluegrass (“Thoughts and Prayers”). A cornucopia of instrumentation is woven into its brisk 42-minute yarn.4360 Hot Chip - A Bath Full of EcstasyWhen Hot Chip achieved chart success with their second album, 2006’s The Warning, it seemed more like a happy coincidence than a sign they were conforming to current pop trends. Since then, they\u0027ve released a string of consistently great albums, from 2008’s Made in the Dark (featuring their only Top 10 single to date, “Ready for the Floor”) to this, their seventh and best record, A Bath Full of Ecstasy. The record frequently switches in tone: Banks can be both formidable and vulnerable, accusatory or filled with regret. “Gimme” demands sex and refuses to be shamed for it “Contaminated” mourns a toxic relationship that can’t be saved and “Stroke” is a bitter riposte to a man emulating the Greek figure Narcissus – laid over a funk guitar riff.4560 Mini Mansions – Guy Walks into a BarMikey Shuman shares vocal duties with Tyler Parkford his voice falls somewhere between the sleazy drawl of his QOTSA bandmate Josh Homme and Alex Turner’s more adenoidal tone on opener “We Should Be Dancing”. With tracks that frequently dart from sprawling, psychedelic pop to scuzzy post-punk and rock references, the record has a superb dynamic that holds the listener’s attention, while the band navigate through a single, tumultuous relationship. By the end of all that, you feel like they deserve a pint. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)Hackman’s debut album, 2015’s We Slept At Last, was a gentle, unprovocative affair –  though if you listened closely, the dark, sexual energy that convulses through her current sound was already there. Her second, I’m Not Your Man, was scuzzier and more explicitly queer – a road she continues down with Any Human Friend, a blunt, bold album on which Hackman’s beatific voice sits atop methodically messy instrumentals.Frontman Corey Taylor, who had just emerged from a toxic relationship when recording this album, addresses feelings of belittlement and inadequacy with unflinching honesty and some of his best vocal work in years. Over the Celtic influences of “Solway Firth” (at one point, he seems to attempt some Cockney screamo) he issues a blistering riposte to the people he holds responsible for his negative mindset.There’s an increased anxiety, both corporeal and emotional, running through The Center Won’t Hold, a pent-up desire to break free from something – though they never seem quite sure what. “Disconnect me from my bones, so I can float, so I can roam,” sings Brownstein – her singular voice all yelps and creaks – on “Hurry On Home”. On “Reach Out”, Tucker begs, her voice a little sleeker than Brownstein’s but no less commanding, “Reach out and see me, I’m losing my head.” Quietly discordant piano ballad “Broken” pays tribute to Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused supreme court judge Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault: “Me, me too, my body cried out when she spoke those lines.”The overarching sound, production and instrumentation on Eve are outstanding. Produced by Rapsody’s long-time collaborator and mentor 9th Wonder, the record samples cuts from Herbie Hancock’s “Watermelon Man” (“Whoopi”) and Phil Collins’s “In the Air Tonight” (“Cleo”), offers a smooth R\u0026ampB joint with “Aaliyah” featuring the late singer’s ghostly backing vocals, and includes an interlude that is “an ode to the black woman’s body”. As on Laila’s Wisdom, Eve conveys Rapsody’s natural feel for funk – “Michelle” (Obama) bounces in on a jaunty piano riff – but other tracks, such as closer “Afeni”, are pure soul.  Swift has a habit of putting her worst foot forward. The album’s lead single, “Me!”, is peppy and poppy in all the wrong ways, a rictus grin of a song that rings hollow. Thank goodness that the rest of the album is nothing like that. Perky opening track “Forgot That You Existed” is a syncopated snigger, on which Swift shrugs off old grudges and breathes a sigh of relief in doing so. “Something magical happened one night,” she sings. “I forgot that you existed. And I thought that it would kill me, but it didn’t.” The title track, meanwhile, is poignant and unfussy, a reminder of Swift’s ability to distil infatuation into something specific and universal. (Alexandra Pollard)One could argue that there’s too much eclecticism here – that if this really is Crow’s final LP, she perhaps could have gone for something with a more singular sound. But then it wouldn’t be a Sheryl Crow album. She sings about the fear of the unknown on “Flying Blind” – her steely determination on this record has you believing that she’ll take the leap regardless. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)There’s more of a soul influence here – “HER Love”, the counterpoint to his 1994 track “I Used to Love HER”,  benefits from the gospel-like vocals of Daniel Caesar and Dwele, while “Memories of Home” skitters over a muffled bass and Common’s recollections of his past – including an incident where he was molested by a family member.This is Del Rey at her most assertive – personally, if not politically. Those hoping for a barbed protest record in keeping with Del Rey’s newfound public activism (last year she called President Trump a “narcissist” who “believes it’s OK to grab a woman by the pussy just because he’s famous”) will be disappointed. But it is gratifying to hear her take control. Aside from “Happiness Is a Butterfly”, that is. “If he’s a serial killer, then what’s the worst that can happen to a girl who’s already hurt?” she asks. Crikey.Assisted by veteran producer John Congleton (St Vincent, John Grant), he channels the spirit of David Bowie and Iggy Pop. He screeches over distorted “ooh oohs” via The Rolling Stones’s “Sympathy for the Devil” on opener “Calm Down aka I Should Not Be Alone”. “Transition from Nowhere to Nowhere” is sung in a Ziggy Stardust croon, while “Rated R Crusaders” shows Furman exploring his Jewish identity in the era of the IsraelPalestine conflict.If Brothers, their brawny album from 2010, turned the pair into serious rock contenders, then 2011’s El Camino cemented their reputation. Yet neither can claim to be as fiendishly catchy as Let’s Rock, a record that can scarcely sit still. On opener “Shine a Light”, the riffs are big, the momentum irresistible, with frontmanguitarist Dan Auerbach layering scabrous licks over ACDC-like chords. Backing singers Leisa Hans and Ashley Wilcoxson add texture to the grooving “LoHi”, while the languid “Sit Around and Miss You” is Stealers Wheels by way of the Deep South. Listen to the melodic harmonies in “Tell Me Lies” and it’s not just the lyrics that’ll remind you of Fleetwood Mac. The tones here are stark and bleak, compared to the claustrophobia of 2014’s Tomorrow’s Modern Boxes. You can hear his paranoia in the stuttering techno opener “Traffic”, which channels the heady grooves and pulses of electronic artist Floating Points (who, with his neuroscience background, seems like an entirely fitting reference point).There are plenty of surprises, like Swizz Beats singing on “Who Are You” against elegant violins that recall a Kamasi Washington composition. “Adult Film” features a gorgeous piano riff the Pete Rock-produced “The Art of It” has a delicious funk vibe “It Never Ends” comes full circle via a bright piano loop. Where a full album produced by Kanye West (2018’s Nasir) didn’t pan out – perhaps because West’s perfectionism was a bad fit for Nas’s penchant for procrastination – “You Mean the World to Me” sounds like it would have been a standout on that record had it not been abandoned on the cutting-room floor. Now it’s a standout on this album. For all the album’s eccentricities, the vibe is earnest fairytale rather than tongue-in-cheek – save for the sound of a strangled feline mirroring the lyrics “when you stepped on your cat” on “How Many Times”. Epic highlight “Electric Fire” and celestial album-closer “How Can a Head” capture Coyne at his most wistful. The latter is a wide-eyed, strings-laden gem, its childlike, questing lyrics poignant whatever your age. 5960 Bat for Lashes – Lost GirlsGiven our current preoccupation with the Eighties, you could argue that Lost Girls is hardly breaking new ground – and yes, nostalgia is a fairly generic formula. But listened to as a whole, the album positively thrums with sonic invention, managing to feel both fresh and full of intrigue. Khan once again demonstrates a knack for uncanny storytelling. Three of her past albums have been nominated for Mercurys expect this to make it four. (Patrick Smith)6060 MUNA – Saves the WorldMUNA might not be a household name yet, but their influence runs through the charts like a stick of rock these days. Listen to Katy Perry’s summer smash “Never Really Over”, or Taylor Swift’s feminist clap back “The Man”, and you’ll hear the same dense, sticky synths and brawny beats that the emo-pop trio have been honing for the past three years. Their debut album, 2017’s About U, was raw, poignant and just the ride side of melodramatic, queering the mainstream, one sad-pop anthem at a time.It’s not uncommon for an artist to be influenced by the place they grew up in. Yet few are likely to have as much inspiration to draw on as India-born, Zimbabwe-raised and now Peckham-based artist Rina Mushonga.On Deerhunter’s eighth album, frontman Bradford Cox takes on the role of war poet, documenting the things he observes with a cool matter-of-factness, and heart-wrenching detail. Death is everywhere on Why Hasn’t Everything Already Disappeared?, as much as others may refuse to see it.After a period of tumult, Sharon Van Etten’s fifth album is a reinvention. But beneath its hazy synths and electronics are songs of endurance and inner peace, of settling after a flurry of activity. 460 Bring Me the Horizon  – AmoBMTH frontman Oli Sykes wants to assert the fragility of the boundary between love and hate. Amo is a way of exploring that, even down to the title itself.560 Nina Nesbitt – The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will ChangeNesbitt is back with her second LP, switching to a brand of soul and R\u0026ampB-fused pop that feels bang on time, and suits her far better. The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will Change has slick, polished production from Fraser T Smith (Adele), Lostboy (Anne-Marie), Jordan Riley (Zara Larsson), and Nesbitt herself.This self-titled record, a loose but beautifully crafted collection of folk-rock songs, explores the kinds of anxieties intrinsic to the modern age – the longing to be at once noticed and invisible the paralysing effects of limitless information, and the desire to do good versus the desire to be seen doing good.The album is packed with personal confessions for the fans – “Arianators” – to pick over. It lacks a centrepiece to match the arresting depth and space of Sweetener’s “God Is A Woman”, but Grande handles its shifting moods and cast of producers (including pop machines Max Martin and Tommy Brown) with engaging class and momentum. One minute you’re skanking along to the party brass of “Bloodline” the next floating into the semi-detached, heartbreak of “Ghostin’”, which appears to address Grande’s guilt at being with Davidson while pining for Miller. She sings of the late rapper as a “wingless angel” with featherlight high notes that will drop the sternest jaw. (Helen Brown)The perma-brilliant James Blake has flooded his fourth album – Assume Form – with euphoric sepia soul and loved-up doo-wop. His trademark intelligence, honesty and pin-drop production remain intact. But the detached chorister vocals of a decade in which he battled depression have thawed to reveal a millennial Sam Cooke crooning: “Can’t believe the way we flow, way we flow, way we flow...”While he recognises his roots and includes plenty of nods to grime, AJ Tracey\u0027s magpie’s eye for a good melody or hook extends far beyond that. With the help of stellar producers like Cadenza (Kiko Bun), Swifta Beater (Kano, Giggs), and Nyge (Section Boyz, Yxng Bane), Tracey incorporates electronic music, rock, garage and even country on his most cohesive work to date.The album title of the year gives us an image of Brexit Britain trashed by Old Etonians David Cameron, Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg, but the fifth studio work from the punk duo has more than social commentary to offer. There’s some of that, as vocalist Jason Williamson skewers documentary-makers who take advantage of the poor in “Kebab Spider” – “the skint get used in loo roll shoes” – but elsewhere this is a record that expands the idea of what Sleaford Mods could be.“Do you still have that photograph? Would you use it to hurt me?” asks Australian indie rocker Julia Jacklin, against the menacing throb of “Body”. The tension is stormy: imagine a mid-period Fleetwood Mac song, covered by Cat Power. It’s a masterclass in narrative songwriting.With praise from Kendrick Lamar, five EPs released by the time she was 21, tours with Lauryn Hill, collaborations with Gorillaz and two critically praised albums – including 2017’s excellent concept album Stillness in Wonderland – fans and critics alike wondered what else Little Simz could do to find the kind of mainstream success enjoyed by so many of her male peers.1360 Solange – When I Get HomeSolange Knowles has never been coy about the intent behind her music. Beautiful arrangements and seamless production notwithstanding, you get the sense, each time she drop a project, that it serves a distinct, zeitgeist-shifting purpose.1460 Foals – Everything Not Saved Will be Lost (Part 1)FoalsMerging their asymmetrical early math pop with the deep space atmospherics of Total Life Forever and Holy Fire, plus added innovations – ambient rainforest throbs on “Moonlight”, deadpan EDM on “In Degrees”, Afro-glitch Radiohead on “Café D’Athens” – they’ve created an inspired album of scorched earth new music that, in all likelihood, will only really be challenged for album of the year by Part 2. (Mark Beaumont)Tracks are at once astute and deeply personal in how they capture vignettes of everyday life and spin them into important lessons. “Black”, the most recent single from the record, considers what that word means to different people around the world, as well as to Dave. “Voices” has him singing over an old-school garage beat, fighting off personal demons.At her best, Sigrid throws out precision-tooled high notes like icicle javelins into vast, blue Scandi-produced skies. Then she growls like an Icelandic volcano preparing to disrupt western civilisation until we sort ourselves out.1760 Karen O and Danger Mouse – Lux PrimaLux Prima was born just over a decade ago from a drunken phone call from Karen O to Danger Mouse – real name Brian Joseph Burton – during which the pair vowed they would work on something together. It wasn’t until after O had given birth to her son, though, that recording finally began, and there is a beatific sense of contentment on songs like “Drown”, with its Kamasi Washington-like choirs and stately horns.This is an ambitious creation, meticulously crafted and assembled. For a start, the range of guest performers is a cornucopia of contemporary soul and hip-hop collaborators: vocalists Moses Sumney, Roots Manuva, Heidi Vogel, Grey Reverend and Tawiah strings player Miguel Atwood-Ferguson, and keyboardist Dennis Hamm – both of whom have worked with Flying Lotus and Thundercat.Rose – who found fame in the UK’s indie-folk scene as an unofficial member of Bombay Bicycle Club in 2010, only to walk away amid the band’s growing hype – is darkly compelling on No Words Left. Assisted by producer Tim Bidwell, who worked on Rose’s last record Something’s Changing, she sounds braver than she ever has before. There are moments that recall her Communion labelmate Ben Howard, on his latest album, Noonday Dream, and others that nod to the quiet stoicism of Joni Mitchell and Neil Young. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)The record is loosely conceptual insomuch as it’s punctuated with mock adverts for “WWAY HEALTH, our 247 care programme”. But don’t be put off: Miss Universe is a brilliant collection of songs, an expansive melange of indie, jazz, pop and trip-hop that flits between a lo-fi sparseness and something The Strokes would play. Yanya – who is of Turkish-Irish-Bajan heritage – grew up in London on a mix of Pixies, Nina Simone, The Libertines and Amy Winehouse, and this unlikely combination is certainly reflected in the sound. (Patrick Smith)2160 Jenny Lewis – On the LineHere, Lewis does what she does best: adds the glossy sparkle of Hollywood and a sunny Californian sheen to melancholy and nostalgia, with her most luxuriantly orchestrated album yet. Even when she’s singing, “I’ve wasted my youth”, it’s in that sweet voice, with carefree “doo doo doo doo doo doos”, and at a pace that’s so upbeat that it masks the sentiment. It’s a bittersweet mourning of her past. (Elisa Bray)Comprising songs from Segall’s eclectic (that’s putting it lightly) catalogue and performed by him and the Freedom Band (Mikal Cronin, Charles Moothart, Emmett Kelly, and Ben Boye), the album is delightfully short and sweet. It is certainly a drastic switch-up from Freedom’s Goblin (2018), which had 19 tracks and ran for 75 minutes.If you want to know how hard it is to categorise Titanic Rising – the enthralling fourth album from Weyes Blood – look no further than the American musician’s own attempt to do so. It is, she says, “The Kinks meet the Second World War, or Bob Seger meets Enya.”Tension aside, there’s a great sense of fun here. The title track is pure euphoria, as restless synths of a Utah Saints or Orbital rave break into swelling bass and melody. And they create the full club experience with “Got to Keep On”, on which the four-to-the-floor beat, funky rhythm guitar, sweet backing vocals and chiming bells make way for the simple sounds of happy party-goers just as the anticipation builds, so does the instrumentation into a hypnotic crescendo. It’s masterful production. (Elisa Bray)Six months after the release of Oxnard, Anderson .Paak returns with another Dr Dre-produced record, Ventura. Where the former was overflowing with choppy, experimental sounds, guest appearances and clumsy attempts at Gil Scott Heron-esque revolutionary lyrics, the sequel – recorded around the same time – streamlines .Paak’s sound, making for a tightly packaged, melodic and danceable album.Two years after the release of his Mercury Prize-nominated debut Yesterday’s Gone, the south London hip-hop artist unveils its follow-up, Not Waving, But Drowning. And if any two records could portray how quickly someone can grow from a boy to a man, it’s these.2760 Lizzo – Cuz I Love YouNo one could accuse Lizzo of holding back. Not when it comes to her voice – which is raw and rowdy, so laden with personality even the vulnerable moments are a joy to listen to –  and certainly not when it comes to her message of unabashed self-love. That’s the predominant theme of the singer  rapper  flautist-extraordinaire’s hugely likeable third album, Cuz I Love You.It seems as likely as Old Man Steptoe dining with the Rees-Mogg, but this new tactic of burying their confrontational gruesomeness beneath a veneer of alt-rock respectability for album three works well for Fat White Family. Drenched in chamber strings and celestial harmonies, the plush yet sinister “Oh Sebastian” could be Pet Sounds selling its soul to the devil. “Fringe Runner” is so sleek and funksome it could be a New Romantic “White Lines (Don’t Don’t Do It)” “Kim’s Sunsets” is a piece of refined cosmic reggae resembling a blissed-out “Bankrobber”.2960 Cage the Elephant – Social CuesOn Cage the Elephant’s fifth album, Social Cues, frontman Matt Shultz reacts to the breakdown of his marriage and the loss of three close friends. He undergoes a kind of Jekyll and Hyde transition through the 13 tracks, the result of which is the band’s best work to date.SOAK reaches to outsiders once again on her new album. 3160 The Cranberries – In the EndThere’s a cruel irony that the release of The Cranberries’ final album should come just a week after journalist Lyra McKee was shot dead by the New IRA during a riot in Londonderry. “Zombie” was a protest song written by the band’s late frontwoman Dolores O’Riordan after two children were killed by IRA bombs – was released. She was deeply affected by the deaths, and would no doubt have been devastated by recent events in Northern Ireland as well.On her third record, Aldous Harding combines the gothic folk of her self-titled 2014 debut with the dramatically intimate tones of her follow-up album Party.Big Thief’s frontwoman Adrianne Lenker has an uncanny ability to make you feel like you’re in on a secret. Her whispering, spectral delivery and deeply personal lyrics are the key to this. Even on the band’s third album UFOF, with an audience that has grown exponentially in the past few years, the songs are still immensely intimate affairs.On his debut album, the 24-year-old Collard mixes sultry jams that recall the electronic funk of MGMT with nods to the greats: Prince, James Brown, Led Zeppelin and Marvin Gaye. Throughout, Collard exhibits his extraordinary voice, which swoops to a devilishly low murmur or soars to an ecstatic falsetto.   Dedicated covers the full, but generic, spectrum of relationships: dizzying love, lust, and break-ups. But whether she’s pining for the return of a former love in the funky disco banger “Julien”, or singing about masturbating post-break-up in lead single “Party For One” (“I’ll be the one If you don’t care about me Making love to myself Back on my beat”), the vibe remains positively jubilant.Getty Images for Spotify3660 Tyler, the Creator - IGOR“I don’t know where I’m going,” Tyler, the Creator begins on the song “I THINK”. “But I know what I’m showing.” The US artist’s words ring true throughout his fifth studio album, IGOR, where he adopts the dark and twisted mutterings of the Frankenstein character from which the record gets its name. It’s been a long wait for Flying Lotus’s new album. In fact, the LA producer has been masterminding Flamagra for the past five years – snatching moments between collaborating with Kendrick Lamar on To Pimp a Butterfly, directing and writing the comic horror movie Kuso, producing much of Thundercat’s Drunk and growing his Brainfeeder label.A heftier sound is never at the cost of melody, which shines through in Thomson’s vocals, the rest of the band’s backing falsetto, and the searing blues grooves stamped all over Future Dust. Those qualities are captured nowhere more satisfyingly than on “25”. “All Over Town” is their singalong anthem, neatly positioned in the middle to ease the pace.In keeping with the relatively restrained guest spots, it’s heartening just how much Skepta has rejected overloading Ignorance is Bliss with high-profile producers, preferring instead to burrow into his own aesthetic. There’s no attempt to chase someone else’s wave here no token drill, afroswing or trap beats to satisfy playlist algorithms. Instead, his cold grime sonics are rendered down to their no-frills essentials – brutalist blocks of sad angular melodies and hard, spacious drums.Bruce Springsteen seems to have told almost every tale in the grand old storybook of American mythologies, except perhaps one: a wide-eyed Californian dreamer finds the Golden State turns sour and flees back east, to some romantic speck of a town, to pine and rehabilitate. It’s the classic pop plotline of Bacharach and David’s “Do You Know the Way to San Jose?”, and it’s a tale Springsteen taps repeatedly here, on his sumptuous, cinematic 19th album, which is nothing short of a late-period masterpiece.A revolving door of female vocalists (A-listers, indie darlings like Angel Olsen and unsung songwriters) deliver heartbroken lines over big, shiny beats and synths. The emotional cohesion the record loses in its shifting cast of singerssongwritersgenres it makes up in DJ-savvy textural variety. Help Us Stranger reaches all corners of guitar rock: funky Detroit garage (“What’s Yours Is Mine”) country soul (“Somedays (I Don’t Feel Like Trying)”) psych (a cover of Donovan’s “Hey Gyp (Dig the Slowness)”) blues and bluegrass (“Thoughts and Prayers”). A cornucopia of instrumentation is woven into its brisk 42-minute yarn.4360 Hot Chip - A Bath Full of EcstasyWhen Hot Chip achieved chart success with their second album, 2006’s The Warning, it seemed more like a happy coincidence than a sign they were conforming to current pop trends. Since then, they\u0027ve released a string of consistently great albums, from 2008’s Made in the Dark (featuring their only Top 10 single to date, “Ready for the Floor”) to this, their seventh and best record, A Bath Full of Ecstasy. The record frequently switches in tone: Banks can be both formidable and vulnerable, accusatory or filled with regret. “Gimme” demands sex and refuses to be shamed for it “Contaminated” mourns a toxic relationship that can’t be saved and “Stroke” is a bitter riposte to a man emulating the Greek figure Narcissus – laid over a funk guitar riff.4560 Mini Mansions – Guy Walks into a BarMikey Shuman shares vocal duties with Tyler Parkford his voice falls somewhere between the sleazy drawl of his QOTSA bandmate Josh Homme and Alex Turner’s more adenoidal tone on opener “We Should Be Dancing”. With tracks that frequently dart from sprawling, psychedelic pop to scuzzy post-punk and rock references, the record has a superb dynamic that holds the listener’s attention, while the band navigate through a single, tumultuous relationship. By the end of all that, you feel like they deserve a pint. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)Hackman’s debut album, 2015’s We Slept At Last, was a gentle, unprovocative affair –  though if you listened closely, the dark, sexual energy that convulses through her current sound was already there. Her second, I’m Not Your Man, was scuzzier and more explicitly queer – a road she continues down with Any Human Friend, a blunt, bold album on which Hackman’s beatific voice sits atop methodically messy instrumentals.Frontman Corey Taylor, who had just emerged from a toxic relationship when recording this album, addresses feelings of belittlement and inadequacy with unflinching honesty and some of his best vocal work in years. Over the Celtic influences of “Solway Firth” (at one point, he seems to attempt some Cockney screamo) he issues a blistering riposte to the people he holds responsible for his negative mindset.There’s an increased anxiety, both corporeal and emotional, running through The Center Won’t Hold, a pent-up desire to break free from something – though they never seem quite sure what. “Disconnect me from my bones, so I can float, so I can roam,” sings Brownstein – her singular voice all yelps and creaks – on “Hurry On Home”. On “Reach Out”, Tucker begs, her voice a little sleeker than Brownstein’s but no less commanding, “Reach out and see me, I’m losing my head.” Quietly discordant piano ballad “Broken” pays tribute to Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused supreme court judge Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault: “Me, me too, my body cried out when she spoke those lines.”The overarching sound, production and instrumentation on Eve are outstanding. Produced by Rapsody’s long-time collaborator and mentor 9th Wonder, the record samples cuts from Herbie Hancock’s “Watermelon Man” (“Whoopi”) and Phil Collins’s “In the Air Tonight” (“Cleo”), offers a smooth R\u0026ampB joint with “Aaliyah” featuring the late singer’s ghostly backing vocals, and includes an interlude that is “an ode to the black woman’s body”. As on Laila’s Wisdom, Eve conveys Rapsody’s natural feel for funk – “Michelle” (Obama) bounces in on a jaunty piano riff – but other tracks, such as closer “Afeni”, are pure soul.  Swift has a habit of putting her worst foot forward. The album’s lead single, “Me!”, is peppy and poppy in all the wrong ways, a rictus grin of a song that rings hollow.

Brexit is not a big deal for Primark, it is more of an event for other people.”ABF also said it has “completed all practical preparations” for Brexit and has contingency plans in place for potential disruption.ABF expects full-year sales at Primark to be 4 per cent up on last year, but much of the growth is due to additional stores being opened.Primark is still the face of fast fashion as growth continuesLike-for-like sales, which strip out that effect, are set to fall 2 per cent globally and 1 per cent in the UK, the company said. ABF’s shares fell 1.8 per cent on Monday after the trading update.

However, sulphur is conspicuously absent. They are all part of a rock record that offers the most detailed look yet into the aftermath of the catastrophe which wiped out 75 per cent of life on Earth.Sean Gulick, a research professor at the University of Texas Institute for Geophysics (UTIG), who worked with an international team of more than two dozen scientists, said the research “tells us about impact processes from an eyewitness location”.“It’s an expanded record of events that we were able to recover from within ground zero,” he said, describing it as a short-lived inferno at the regional level, followed by a long period of global cooling.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailThe research, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, builds on earlier work by the Jackson School of Geosciences which described how the crater formed and how life quickly recovered at the impact site.\u0026nbspMost of the material that filled the crater within hours of impact was produced at the impact site or was swept in by seawater pouring back into the crater from the surrounding Gulf of Mexico.\u0026nbspIn just one day about 425 feet of material was deposited – a rate that’s among the highest ever encountered in the geologic record.\u0026nbspThis breakneck rate of accumulation meant the rocks recorded what was happening in the environment within and around the crater in the minutes and hours after impact and provide clues about the longer-lasting effects of the asteroid strike.\u0026nbspThe research details how the blast from the impact ignited trees and plants stretching thousands of miles away and triggered a massive tsunami that reached as far inland as Illinois (over 500 miles).\u0026nbspInside the crater, as well as charcoal, the research team found a chemical biomarker associated with soil fungi within or just above layers of sand that shows signs of being deposited by resurging waters. This suggests the charred landscape was deluged by the tsunami, then pulled into the crater as the floodwaters retreated.Higher oxygen levels helped dinosaurs to flourish, say scientists‘Forgotten dinosaurs’ returning from edge of extinction in US riversRussell Crowe bought a £23,000 dinosaur head from Leonardo DiCaprioDinosaur skeletons captured in stunning detailJay Melosh, a Purdue University professor and expert on impact cratering, said finding evidence for wildfire helps scientists know their understanding of the asteroid impact is on the right track.“It was a momentous day in the history of life, and this is a very clear documentation of what happened at ground zero,” said Professor Melosh, who was not involved with this study.One of the most important findings from the research is the lack of sulphur in the core samples. The area surrounding the impact crater is full of sulphur-rich rocks. But there was no sulphur in the core.The discovery supports the theory the asteroid impact vaporised the sulphur-bearing minerals present at the impact site and released it into the atmosphere, where it wreaked havoc on the Earth’s climate, reflecting sunlight away from the planet and causing global cooling.\u0026nbspResearchers estimate at least 325 billion metric tons of sulphur would have been released by the impact. That’s about four times the quantity spewed out during the 1883 eruption of Krakatoa – an event which cooled the Earth’s climate by an average of\u0026nbsp1C\u0026nbspfor five years.Although the asteroid impact created mass destruction at the regional level, it was this global climate change that caused the mass extinction, killing off the dinosaurs along with most other life on the planet at the time.“The real killer has got to be atmospheric,” Professor Gulick said. “The only way you get a global mass extinction like this is an atmospheric effect.”university of texas at austin\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Minds Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Minds.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

It showed a strip light that appears to be at the front of the truck, though the image is too dark to reveal any significant details.Despite Tesla revealing very few details about its electric pickup truck, Mr Musk has spoken briefly about it in several interviews.At an event earlier this year, Tesla teased an image of the pick-up truck but it did not give much away.

It’s gonna be awesome.“I actually don’t know if a lot of people will buy this pickup truck or not, but I don’t care. I mean I do care, eventually, you know... We wanna get gasoline, diesel pickup trucks off the road.”If the futuristic design means the truck does not prove to be a commercial success, Mr Musk said he would consider making a “more conventional truck” in the future.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The director\u0027s adaptation is a nonsensical, deeply convoluted disaster that wastes an enjoyably oddball cast. It\u0027s the only one of Lynch\u0027s films the director has publicly disowned. Still, hopes are high that next year’s version from Arrival director Denis Villeneuve, starring Timothée Chalamet and Zendaya, will somehow be better.  326 The Bonfire of the Vanities (1990)Fresh off the success of bestselling novel The Bonfire of the Vanities, Warner Bros bought the rights from Tom Wolfe for a staggering $750,000. Tom Hanks and Melanie Griffiths were both (mis)cast in the lead roles after director Brian De Palma\u0027s preferred choices turned him down. The filmmaker himself struggled to spin the 1990 production\u0027s many plates amid reports of rising on-set troubles that were all witnessed and documented in Julie Salmon\u0027s follow-up book, The Devil\u0027s Candy.1991 gangster film Billy Bathgate, which stars Dustin Hoffman and Nicole Kidman, did no justice to EL Doctorow\u0027s beloved 1989 novel. With the efforts of Oscar-winning Kramer vs Kramer director Robert Benton and a script by Tom Stoppard, the film had all the ingredients to become as good as The Godfather, Scarface, and Goodfellas. Instead, it was a hollow adaptation, largely because all the magic was lost with the absence of the central character\u0027s narration – a huge reason behind the novel\u0027s success.The Scarlet Letter (1995) is ranked as one of the worst book adaptations ever made and for good reason. Described by DH Lawrence as “a perfect work of the American imagination, the book was handed a Hollywood makeover that found itself the brunt of ridicule after flopping at the box office. Director Roland Joffé strayed so far from Nathaniel Hawthorne\u0027s pages that what should have been an enticing romance became an extremely throwaway erotic drama.  To be fair, few would be able to turn L Ron Hubbard’s allegedly Scientology-inspired Battlefield Earth (2000) into something decent. This John Travolta-with-dreadlocks epic has since gone down in “Worst Movies Ever” infamy, effectively ending Travolta’s mainstream movie career and destroying Barry Pepper’s before it even started.  Louis de Bernières\u0027s Captain Corelli\u0027s Mandolin was one of the biggest literary successes of the 1990s, but the 2001 film version – from the same British company that made Notting Hill – lost all traces of the novel\u0027s heart and soul. The dialogue is disastrous and lead stars Nicolas Cage (Captain Corelli) and Penélope Cruz (Pelagia) lack any chemistry. It may look pretty, but this adaptation was a complete mistake.  The beauty of HG Wells’s 1895 science fiction novella The Time Machine was lost amid all the CGI in this insipid 2002 adaptation, which was directed by Wells\u0027s great-grandson, Simon. Everything featured, including Guy Pearce\u0027s lead performance, is wooden apart from the copper time travel contraption at the heart of the story.There have been just as many disappointing Stephen King adaptations as there have been successful ones, but Dreamcatcher sits at the bottom of that list. The talent was present (Damian Lewis! Morgan Freeman! Timothy Olyphant!), but the end product never once correlates to anything at all decent. The film\u0027s late-stage swerve into monster movie territory is nothing short of dreadful.Before he took on the role of 007, Daniel Craig starred in this adaptation of Ian McEwan’s novel about people whose lives become entangled after witnessing a deadly accident. While Craig’s performance as college lecturer Joe, along with Rhys Ifans as Jed – the man who becomes obsessed with him – are convincing, the film allows little time for character development and suffers because of it.Nick Hornby adaptations don’t inherently need to be set in the UK (the John Cusack-starring High Fidelity, if you like that sort of thing, is something of a classic, after all), but they do need to translate the fussy, infuriating male neuroses of his novels. The Perfect Catch is the 2005 US adaptation of Hornby’s Fever Pitch, released a decade after Colin Firth starred in his own British adaptation, and transforms the source material into a more throwaway and uninteresting big-city romcom. Drew Barrymore, in a \u0027girlfriend’ role significantly beefed up in comparison to Hornby’s novel, is great, but watching her try and source chemistry with a shrill and unappealing Jimmy Fallon (in one of his rare, pre-talk show acting roles) is harrowing.The Da Vinci Code is a stinker of the highest order. Its sequels, Angels \u0026amp Demons (2009) and Inferno (2016), are also awful films, but the reason the initial Dan Brown adaptation ranks as the worst is because the others wouldn\u0027t have existed had this one not been so successful.20th Century Fox clearly wanted Eragon to be their answer to Harry Potter, but the terrible reviews stopped that plan dead in its tracks. Eragon is the worst kind of fantasy adaptation – one where all of the source materials\u0027 sense of fantastical vibrancy disappears during its translation to the big screen.1426 Running with Scissors (2006)Augusten Burroughs’s Running with Scissors consistently walks a dangerous tightrope between manic farce and adolescent horror tale. Ryan Murphy’s adaptation, released in 2006, collapses beneath such a task. You can see why Murphy, for his feature film debut, would be attracted to a tale of neurotic family dysfunction and sexual awakening as they are themes that crop up in many of his TV shows (Glee, American Horror Story, etc). But this adaptation is a tonal misfire from start to finish, despite the best efforts of an all-star cast that includes Annette Bening, Gwyneth Paltrow, Evan Rachel Wood and Brian Cox. It’s no wonder this sunk without a trace. In another case of Hollywood throwing money at something in the belief that will be enough, Philip Pullman’s superb His Dark Materials trilogy – or rather, the first book Northern Lights – was condensed into an agonising mess of CGI and hammy acting in 2007\u0027s The Golden Compass. Much of the blame went to the fact that Hollywood, where God is thanked above anyone else at the Oscars, would likely be uncomfortable handling material that was so critical of the Catholic church. It also suffered by trying to condense an overwhelming amount of information into the opening few scenes. A forthcoming BBC adaptation starring James McAvoy and Lin-Manuel Miranda looks far more promising.Where to start with this disaster of a film? Audrey Niffenegger’s The Time Traveller\u0027s Wife is beautifully and convincingly written, but there\u0027s nothing convincing about its adaptation. Producers thought casting two major Hollywood stars was a good idea, but Rachel McAdams and Eric Bana had zero chemistry. Cloud Atlas (2012) is by no means a disaster, but it\u0027s meandering plot lines, sketchy pacing and often questionable acting (Hanks has never been dodgier) do David Mitchell\u0027s sprawling, inventive novel a disservice. Still, it\u0027s an enjoyable Wachowskis romp that features Hugh Grant as a cannibal tribesman, so it has that going for it.Fans of The Hobbit did not expect the novel, so short and sweet and set in such a familiar and adored world, to be messed up by The Lord of the Rings maestro Peter Jackson – but that’s exactly what happened. While the trilogy of Hobbit films were a box-office success, they came under fire from critics for stretching the book\u0027s material too thin. Third outing, The Battle of Five Armies, was the worst received of all three.  The film adaptation of the profoundly moving and dark tale The Book Thief, which follows a young girl in Nazi Germany, is tonally off from the first scene. The glossy cinematography and excessively sentimental score jar with its grim subject matter and the performances verge on caricature. It doesn\u0027t help that all of the English dialogue is spoken with a German accent.No adaptation of The Great Gatsby,  F Scott Fitzgerald’s most famous work, has managed to capture the excess, glamour and underlying sleaze of the roaring Twenties. Baz Luhrmann\u0027s 2013 version was fun and arguably the best at revealing the insecurities of (a brilliant) Leonardo DiCaprio’s Gatsby. However, the flashiness of the production stripped away all of Fitzgerald’s delicate story-telling.Disgraced producer Harvey Weinstein’s fingerprints are all over this messy adaptation of Young Adult novel The Giver (2014), which attempts to fuse a sincere, thoughtful allegory with a Twilight-style love story backed up by action fresh from The Hunger Games  and a Taylor Swift cameo. By attempting to appeal to every single teenager all at once, though, The Giver loses sight of its fascinating dystopian premise and gives its eccentric cast (among them Jeff Bridges, Meryl Streep, Alexander Skarsgård and Katie Holmes) very little to do.  John Niven\u0027s Kill Your Friends is a blistering, debauched exploration into the life of a cocaine-sniffing record label agent. It passes by in the blink of an eye, which can\u0027t be said for its adaptation. The film, released in 2015, tries so hard to nail what Niven achieves so fluidly and it shows – the result is nothing short of embarrassing with the clean-cut Nicholas Hoult failing to convince as the sociopathic Steven Stelfox.2326 The Girl on the Train (2016)Although it will always exist in the shadow of Gillian Flynn’s ingenious thriller Gone Girl, The Girl on the Train is an undeniably pacy and intelligent novel. But it was completely let down by this US film adaptation. The 2016 release, starring Emily Blunt, is cheesy and lacking in nuance – and criminally takes the story away from its original gritty London setting, plonking the characters down in glossy New York for no apparent reason. The 2016 adaptation of Me Before You, starring Emilia Clarke and Sam Claflin, was brutally panned by critics for being emotionally manipulative. Its bad acting and problematic premise didn\u0027t help, either. Clarke\u0027s performance as the paid companion to Claflin’s quadriplegic was in particular criticised for being offensively exaggerated.  While not the same calibre of flop as Dreamcatcher, The Dark Tower is a fine example of a botched attempt at adapting one of Stephen King\u0027s finest works. With Idris Elba and Matthew McConaughey in the lead roles as the heroic and villainous characters caught in a fated tussle, it should have soared – but a rush job such as Nikolaj Arcel\u0027s 2017 film is no way to treat such an expansive piece of work. Despite magnetic performances from Saoirse Ronan and Billy Howle, this adaptation of Ian McEwan\u0027s On Chesil Beach was weighed down by a turgid script and clumsy old-age make-up. The finished product is worlds away from the McEwan adaptation that Ronan previously starred in –\u0026nbspthe Oscar-winning drama Atonement (2007).Dune was never going to be an easy book to turn into a two-hour action movie – and David Lynch’s attempt is proof that it should be best left alone.

He just wants to see his kids. My youngest was six weeks old when he last saw him’Click to followThe IndependentAn American man has been blocked from spending his birthday with his wife and three young children after immigration officials in Dublin refused to grant him entry to the country, meaning he couldn\u0027t\u0026nbspcontinue\u0026nbsphis journey to Northern Ireland.Kylie Crawford, 32, said she was “heartbroken” when her husband, Ryan Volrath, was detained at Dublin airport on Sunday, thwarting the couple’s plan to surprise their three young sons with his arrival at their home in County Tyrone.He was placed on a flight to Atlanta on Monday morning after immigration officials claimed there was a risk he could try to overstay his visit visa.The family had lived in the US for 10 years before they decided to move to Ms Crawford’s home country Northern Ireland last September. Mr Volrath, a carpenter, came on a six-month visit\u0026nbspvisa\u0026nbspin the belief that he would be able to obtain a spouse visa so that they could settle as a family.But they hadn’t realised that the minimum income requirements would mean Ms Crawford would have to earn more than £18,600 for her husband to join them, which she said was “impossible” with three young children, including a 10-month-old, to look after alone.Donavon, aged 10 months, haven\u0027t seen their father since JanuaryMr Volrath went back to the US and is now working there and sending money to his wife until they are able to obtain a visa. He had planned to visit his family for 10 days over his birthday before he was blocked at the airport.A video posted by Ms Crawford on Twitter shows her three-year-old son Foster burst into tears when she told him her couldn’t speak with his father on the phone on Sunday, and says between sobs: “I want Daddy to come home.”Ms Crawford, a photographer, told The Independent she hadn’t slept since discovering that her husband was being held by the immigration authorities. She travelled to Dublin on Sunday in a desperate bid to stop Mr Volrath from being sent back to the US.Families forced to spend Christmas apart due to UK immigration rulesHome Office splits British man from wife 10 months after she has babyWife of seriously ill British man facing imminent deportation“I was messaging him.

And the fact that we were hoping to get a spouse visa, why would we risk him overstaying? she added.Families forced to spend Christmas apart due to UK immigration rulesMs Crawford also questioned the wider immigration rules, saying: “How am I meant to earn £18,600 when raising three kids on my own? How do they expect people to do that? I’m forced to be a single parent. I can’t work so I’m forced to be on benefits, which is not something I’m proud of but I need to in order to survive. My husband sends me whatever he can.“This is meant to be my home country. But why would I want to now bring my husband here and have my family here when this is how we’re treated off the bat?\u0026nbspI wish we had stayed in the US.”Reacting to the situation, Mary Atkinson, families together campaign officer at the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, said: The\u0026nbsppublic will\u0026nbspbe appalled to know what is being done to families in their name.“All that this family wants to do is build a life together – instead, they are trapped in an impossible situation, unable to be together because of the UK’s family separation laws. \u0026nbsp“The government must act immediately to scrap unfair income requirements that tear so many families apart, and make Britain a place that welcomes families like Ryan and Kylie’s.”The Irish immigration authorities\u0026nbsphave been approached for comment.Asylum and Immigration\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Minds Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Minds.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Supporting an inidual animal for its lifetime will set you back Rs300,000 (£3,400).Cash gifts to cow shelters are a common, albeit informal, practice in India. They are the kind of Hindu charity said to bring good fortune – and newspapers often carry adverts from such facilities asking for donations.But after successful schemes by public cow shelters in the state to let businesses\u0026nbspand NRIs – non-resident Indians – adopt inidual cows, the Madhya Pradesh (MP) government is now rolling this scheme out to let anyone get involved, and hopes the new website will speed up the process.With a rise in cow protection vigilantism and state laws banning the slaughter of cattle, India is suffering from a stray cow crisis.In MP alone, the government says there are 700,000 dairy cows who have stopped producing milk and been abandoned by their owners.Earlier this year, the MP government pledged to fund 1,000 new cow shelters – a promise which surprised some, since the state had recently changed hands from the Hindu nationalist BJP party of Narendra Modi – more associated with cow protection – to the progressive and secularist Congress party.Congress at the time said it too was a party that cared about cows, and claimed that the BJP had failed to build a single new shelter in its previous 15 years in power in the state.The state minister for animal husbandry, Lakhan Singh Yadav, said the new website and app would help bridge the “problem of funds” in setting up new shelters.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The shelter doesn\u0027t have its own hospital, so send cows to other facilities for major operationsOfficials said they aimed to launch the website and app by the end of the month. As well as the main offering of adopting a cow for between 15 days and a lifetime, users on a tighter budget will also be able to purchase specific items the animals might need – from fresh green fodder and medicines to fans that keep them cool in the heat of the day.While this is believed to be the first government website set up just for cow adoption, it is not the first state to come up with creative solutions to the same problem.Last month the BJP government in Uttar Pradesh said it was putting up 100,000 abandoned cows for actual adoption, and that any charitable citizens who took a cow into their homes would be paid a monthly stipend of Rs900 (£10) to help cover upkeep.And in Rajasthan, the Congress government proposed a scheme in January to pay tribute to those who (financially) adopted cows during events on Independence Day and Republic day. The policy was dropped, however, when it turned out it had first been proposed by the previous\u0026nbspBJP administration.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Minds Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Minds.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

It is a pathetic showing for a main opposition party at a time when it should be sailing ahead.Corbyn — branded a chicken by Boris Johnson for blocking a snap election — is doing so much worse than he did in his unexpectedly strong  ­election campaign.That’s because voters have seen so much more of this unreconstructed Marxist than they had then. And the more they see, the less they like it.Gradually it is dawning on the country that the economic policies advanced by Corbyn and his even more left-wing shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, would not so much redistribute national wealth as obliterate it.Earlier this week McDonnell came up with his latest wheeze for robbing the rich and — as he sees it — giving to the poor.He promised to give private tenants a “right to buy” their homes at a discount. I can see why this policy might initially seem attractive to young people who have been priced out of the housing market — a group with whom I have a lot of sympathy.Notionally, the policy may seem little dferent from Mrs Thatcher’s right to buy which enabled a generation of council house tenants to become homeowners for the first time.But there is every dference. If private investors were forced to sell their properties at a discount it would crash the housing market. Who would want to buy a property, knowing that the Government could come along at any moment and confiscate it If you crash the housing market, you crash the ­mortgage market, too. Private tenants might in theory gain the right to buy their homes, but that will not be much usebanks refuse to lend them any money.Confiscation is a thread which runs through so much of Labour’s programme.McDonnell has already announced a plan to snatch ten per cent of the shares of all private companies with more than  employees.He wants to put these shares into what he calls an inclusive ownership fund, invested on behalf of the workers.The workers shouldn’t get too excited, though. They would be allowed a maximum of £ a year in idends — and that onlytheir ­company was able to pay a idend.Meanwhile, the value of ordinary people’s pensions would plummet by far more than £. According to an analysis by law firm Clford Chance, workers would gain £billion — but overall, investors would lose £billion as share values crashed.Labour’s plan would dilute a company’s shares, effectively confiscating wealth from existing shareholders.Corbyn and McDonnell ­promote a fantasy that shareholders are a bunch of capitalist fatcats.Yet the reality is that almost everyone who works in the private sector is indirectly a shareholder. Share investments form the bedrock of the pension funds on which we will rely in old age.EvenMcDonnell was only helping himself to ten per cent of company shares initially, he could be sure to come back for more when his tax revenues failed to match his vast spending plans.These include spending £billion nationalising utility companies — that is £billion for gas and electricity firms, £billion for water firms, £billion to buy out Private Finance Initiativecontracts for schools and hospitals and £.billion for the Royal Mail.Labour claims this will save householders an average of £ a year on the basis that these firms will no longer have to pay shareholders.But he overlooks the poor record of nationalised industry. Lower efficiency could well lead to higher prices.How is McDonnell going to bring in the revenue for his massive spending plans He seems to live under the delusion thatyou raise taxes by x per cent, revenue, too, will rise by x per cent.Thus he claimed, in Labour’s  manesto, that reversing corporation tax cuts would raise £billion. But tax doesn’t work like that. In fact, cuts to corporation tax made by George Osborne increased revenue as multinationals erted profits to, rather than away from, Britain.So it is perverse for Labour to claim jacking up rates again will raise extra money. On the contrary, McDonnell would likely end up with LESS revenue.As for iniduals, McDonnell has promised to increase income tax for the top ten per cent of earners, which means anyone on more than £, a year. The top rate of income tax would go up to  per cent.But the real damage could come from a wealth tax — an annual levy on the value of homes, shares, bonds and all other assets.Although not yet Labour party policy, McDonnell has previously expressed approval for a whopping  per cent levy on the wealthiest ten per cent of the population.It wouldn’t be the super-wealthy who paid — they would quickly be off.In the s, a high-tax Labour ­government caused a brain drain which led to net outwards migration of , people over a few years.It would be worse now, as wealthy iniduals and businesses are much more mobile compared with the s.The real victims of a wealth tax would be ordinary people who have spent years saving to buy a home and build themselves a half-decent pension. To qualy for McDonnell’s wealth tax you would only need to own a home, and to have a pension with a combined value of £,.With Labour on just  per cent in the polls, of course, the nightmare of a Corbyn government — or at least a Corbyn majority government — is at the moment unlikely.But no one should be ­complacent.We could all too easily end up with a Labour-SNP coalition with the ­Scottish Nationalists happy to inflict pain on English, Welsh and Northern Irish voters infor the promise of a second independence referendum.Over the past couple of years we have had endless attempts to blame Brexit for every economic woe. Actually, over that period, employment has risen to an all-time high and the economy, except for the last quarter, has grown.But international investors, have been shy of Britain.The uncertainty over Brexit doesn’t help but talk to wealth managers and they tell you a very dferent story.What really strikes terror into investors is the prospect of Jeremy Corbyn arriving at the door to No.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

So clubs will get prize money for the first time and be able to channel the rewards of their success on the pitch into new jobs, including more professional coaches.”Former England ladies’ captain Kelly Smith says: “A few years ago, men’s football defined the women’s game — but not any longer.”AT just , Amy Merricks is assistant manager of the Brighton  Hove Albion ladies’ first team.

It made her sound like a celebrity wanting to publicise a new album or movie.“I mean, in reality she is a celebrity. She’s very familiar with magazines and social media and PR — she prides herself in the knowledge she has.”Officially the company will now be working Stateside on the new Sussex Royal charity foundation, which Meghan and Harry formed following their split with Prince William and Kate.But it means the couple now have access to American PR and crisis management experts on their payroll whenever they want advice.That’s even though they already have well-regarded global PR chief Sara Latham — who was a senior adviser to Hillary Clinton’s  presidential campaign — working for them at Buckingham Palace.Another royal source added: “This is Meghan’s way of being able to get a Hollywood answer to a questionshe’s not hearing what she wants to from the Palace.“But that’s a dangerous precedent to set because there is a reason why courtiers and advisers treat members of the Royal Family dferently — they are not celebrities, they are publicly funded official figures with a formal role.“And they need to hear the truth, evenit’s not the answer they want. That’s something Harry does not like and Meghan isn’t familiar with from her former career.“They appear tone-deaf to criticism at times, which was proven this week by Harry in Amsterdam and by Meghan going to New York and not Balmoral.”But Meghan is said to be concern­ed the public is turning on her after damaging revelations over her relationship with her estranged father Thomas Markle, stories about her negative relationship with William and Kate, and hypocrisy over taking private jets while claiming she is an eco-warrior.The clearest suggestion Meghan is choosing to ignore formal advice is shown by the growing influence of her secret team in Hollywood.Gersh is one of the leading agencies in Hollywood, with many Oscar winners and major TV stars in their client roster including Kristen Stewart, Adam Driver, Tobey Maguire and Jamie Foxx.A separate senior royal insider revealed: “Courtiers at the Palace are aware of these three men working in some capacity for Meghan on the quiet. They have been involved in her finances which is understandable given her former work in America.What’s worrying is their role in ongoing projects like her children’s book, which would usually be handled by Palace staff.“But she’s learning how dferent le inside the Royal Family is compared to her previous career. There are times she feels frustrated.”There is a growing feeling within royal circles that Meghan could be preparing to spend at least part of the year back in Calornia in the future.Prince Harry has already announced his first major TV project will be produced by Oprah Winfrey’s com­pany for US giant Apple’s new streaming service.But senior Palace staff hope a plan for the couple to spend part of the year living in South Africa will stop them getting restless and unhappy in the UK.The royal source added: “From just a few months after the royal wedding there has been a growing drum­beat about Harry and Meghan moving to the US eventually.That’s one of the reasons they are being encouraged to spend time in South Africa because it’s a Commonwealth country and keeps them part of the fold.”Some Palace staff wish Meghan had taken an exten­ded maternity leave after Archie’s birth so the goodwill from the public and media initially granted to her ed. But in fairness to Meghan, her allies point out that isn’t her style.A source close to the Duchess explained: “Meghan is a working woman. She has spent her le using her talent, ambition and desire to create a successful career.“She loves being busy and her intention was never to disappear because she became a mum.“She wants to prove herself and doesn’t want to let criticism or tradition change what she sees as her purpose in le.”You could argue that Meghan has never hidden her ambition.During her televised engagement interview, Meghan artfully dodged whether she was quitting showbiz altogether.Asked about her career change, she replied: “I do not see it as giving anything up. I see it as a change. It is a new chapter.”But with the criticism of the couple’s unconventional behaviour growing, it’s as yet unclearthe unlikely love story of the B-list Hollywood actress and beloved English prince has a happy ending. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I think it’s the Spitfire. And neither of us is going to sht. Ever.So here we are. We cannot do a reasonable deal with Europe because our No Deal bargaining chip has been taken away.The Prime Minister can’t do anything meaningful because he doesn’t command a majority. And he isn’t even allowed to call a General Election.I understand why Remainers are doing everything in their power to delay our departure from the EU for as long as possible. And I understand why this is making Brexiteers so furious.Me  I’ve reached the point where I’m past caring. I just want something to happen and so long as Corbyn is kept out of No  Downing Street, I don’t really care what.Sadly, the only way forward is to crawl across the Channel on our hands and knees and literally beg for a deadline extension to next February. Or June. Or the year .And then what  Europe will either offer us the same deal that’s already been rejected by Parliament three times or they will offer us something worse.We are — and there’s no other word for it — f***ed.Right up to the moment when there is a General Election Corbyn will win.And then we will come to know what being f***ed really means.To prevent that, we must do what any right-thinking person does in a time of real emergency and turn for guidance to the US soap opera Dallas.You see, back in , the American actor Patrick Duffy went on a bit of an ego trip.He’d been the Man From Atlantis and Bobby Ewing in Dallas. He’d even recorded a song that reached No  in the Dutch hit parade.So he obviously figured the world was his oyster and he’d be the new Al Pacino.It didn’t work out well. The only role he got was as a goat in a TV movie no one watched, so he decided the following year that he’d like to go back to Dallas, the show that made his name.So in order to accommodate his wishes, the scriptwriters decided his death — and every single thing that happened in the  subsequent months — had been a dream.And guess what We bought it. We all turned to one another in our lounges and our sitting rooms and said: “Yup, that seems reasonable.”So this is what I suggest.On Monday morning, David Cameron walks out of Downing Street and says that, having considered all the options, he is NOT going to call a referendum.Andanyone says, “Hang on a minute, what about Article  and Theresa May and the last election ”, we just say: “Nah, mate, you must have been dreaming.”YOU must have noticed that ever since the fire brigade were given those huge pliers that can cut the roof off a car, they always, always, ALWAYS cut the roof off any car that’s been in an accident.“We must, in case one of the occupants has a broken back,” they always say.Yes – but once, a couple who’d been completely uninjured in a minor traffic accident were invited by Plod to shelter from the drizzle in the police car.When the fire brigade arrived – and I’m not making this up – they cut the roof off the police car so the couple could get out again. And it seems they have the same problem in America.Because this week, the comedian Kevin Hart was a passenger in his exquisite and very rare Plymouth Barracuda when it crashed.Fire crews could have pulled him out through the door, so the car could then be repaired.But no. They cut the roof off, so now it can’t.Yup. Kevin will get better soon but his ’Cuda has gone to the great muscle-car graveyard in the sky.MORE evidence that mankind is losing the capacity for reasoned thought came this week when a bunch of “trans-feminist anti-speciesists”Meanwhile, in Syria . . .VISITORS to a new exhibition at the very traditional Royal Academy will find the only door is partially blocked by a naked man and a naked woman.The only solution is to squeeze between them.This begs many questions. But first up, this naked man.He has to spend all day with no clothes on, face to face with an attractive naked woman while people brush past his parts.I do hope he takes, um, precautions every morning. Or it is very likely he’ll become the world’s first human turnstile.WE had more proof this week that animal rights enthusiasts are not completely right in the head.They tried to claim in an advert that wearing wool is just as cruel as wearing fur – forgetting, perhaps, that to make a woolly jumper, the sheep doesn’t actually have to be killed.In fact, you HAVE to shear a sheep before the hot summer begins because very few breeds are capable of moulting by themselves.If you’ve got all that wool lying around, what are you going to do  Throw it away and make a jumper out of . . . nylon Great idea. Because nylon is made from crude oil.It’s basically like plastic. So we’d end up one day with lots of jumpers that won’t rot, floating around in the oceans choking turtles.Happily, the Advertising Standards Authority told the idiotic animal rights people to think of a new ad.Which means they’ll probably ask Naomi Campbell to climb off whatever piece of horrible Eurotrash she’s sitting on this week and get her kit off again.Excellent.The judge described her as “arrogant”.Hmm. Not sure about that.I thinkyou take someone ’s child to the doctor and ask him to lop off half the kid’s penis, you’re not being arrogant.You’re being deranged.THERE have been some unusual breakthroughs in the world of cars this week.Bugatti announced a specially modied Bugatti Chiron had become the first road-going car ever to break the mph barrier.Even though there is no road in the world where you could physically reach such a speed.Meanwhile, Nissan unveiled an app that allows you to see where your car is.Which is something Malaysia Airlines never thought of.And which won’t go down very well with cheating spouses.But Ford topped the lot by saying it can now fit a projector into the boot lid so that you can watch a movie in the cold and the rain.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But in the past few years his image has become somewhat tarnished.He’s no longer the boy wonder who can do no wrong and this week Brad revealed how he spent  months going to Alcoholics Anonymous meetings after his marriage to Angelina Jolie broke down.He was with an all-male AA group and described it as “removing his drinking privileges” — but said it was a “freeing” experience. I suspect he is the kind of straight man who prefers the company of other fellas.He seems far happier just watching baseball on TV with some of his mates than dressed up in a tuxedo at a red-carpet event with a glamorous woman on his arm.There were rumours that his drinking was a factor in wrecking his relationship with Angelina — with accusations of him having a booze-fuelled rant at one of the older kids — and even close pals agreed that he needed help getting back on track.While he has been trying to get his act together — and all credit to him for seeking help —  months down the line Brad is still trying to officially “consciously uncouple” from Angelina.The y orce proceedings and bitter child-custody battle have at times been highly toxic but now we are told it is all being settled behind closed doors. This means that the lawyers will be having a field day and it will be costing an absolute fortune.The whole split will have been incredibly stressful so it’s maybe no wonder Brad sought solace by hitting the bottle. But let’s just take a look at Jenner.It’s hard to believe she was once an object of pity after Brad fell head over heels for Angelina when she was his movie co-star in Mr  Mrs Smith back in .Jenner is now light years from the supposed “woman scorned” who everyone felt desperately sorry for — she is currently right at the very top of her game.Jenner has turned  and appears on the current cover of Instyle magazine, glowing with health and happiness and looking at least two decades younger.As well as the famous split with Brad, she didn’t have the easiest time finding her feet in Hollywood. After Friends came to an end, her film career failed to take off and then stalled with a series of pretty dire rom-coms.To her credit, Jenner bounced back spectacularly with a string of hits and critically acclaimed roles — in movies such as Cake, Mother’s Day, Dumplin’ and, most recently, Murder Mystery.Although none of her post-Brad relationships lasted the distance and her marriage to Justin Theroux ended in orce, Jenner now seems very comfortable in her own skin.She has said before that she doesn’t want people to feel she needs their sympathy and that she is extremely happy with her le. She is clearly frustrated at being labelled the “deserted we” and has long since made her peace with Brad.So much so that he was a guest at her th birthday party and they are friends — with real affection for one another. Brad and Angelina have always insisted they got together after his marriage to Jenner was in trouble, but all couples go through bad patches and you do have to wonder just what would have happenedMr  Mrs Smith had never been made.Perhaps Brad and Jen would have been able to talk through any tensions and misunderstandings and save their relationship. A lot of people would like to see these two back together again, but I reckon Brad is now carrying too much baggage for a woman such as Jenner.Who would have thought she would end up being the stronger of the two  They do say the best revenge is living a good le — and Jenner is the proof of that.SHE looked frail and unsteady at times walking up Downing Street to No  but Barbara Windsor’s glorious smile never faded. The -year-old was on a mission as she delivered a letter to Boris Johnson calling on him to improve dementia care.It was typical Barbara, drawing on every ounce of her strength and resilience to make sure the needs of dementia sufferers are heard. Leaning on the arm of devoted husband Scott, above, who has been her rock since her Alzheimer’s diagnosis, it was heartening to see glimpses of the Barbara we all love.She was immaculately made up and her trademark blonde beehive was teased higher than ever. She smiled, waved and joked with everyone, but you could seeshe was exhausted as well as exhilarated. Seeing Barbara and Scott together – and the tender way he takes care of her – is so moving.This vile disease might be cruelly robbing him of the woman he loves, but the two of them endeavour to make the most of every day and they are doing a vital job in raising money and awareness so one day we might even conquer dementia.What a tribute that would be to one of the most delightful women I’ve ever been lucky enough to come across.MY thoughts are with Alexandra Burke and her footballer partner Angus MacDonald, who has been diagnosed with bowel cancer at the heartbreakingly young age of .The Hull City defender is a fit sportsman and the news proves this hellish disease can strike down anyone. I hope the cancer has been caught early and he will go on to make a full recovery with singer Alexandra by his side.It’s going to be a very tough time for them both – but I hope all the support and good wishes being sent their way will be of some help and comfort.I’M a bit bemused that Harry and Meghan have apparently declined an invitation to his granny’s Highland home, saying baby Archie is too young.Their four-month-old has already flown to Ibiza for a week on a private jet and is about to go on a long trip to South Africa. By all accounts, there is also an upcoming trip to Calornia so Mum and Dad can go househunting.So to say he’s too small to pop up the road to Scotland seems somewhat disingenuous. The Queen always invites her family to Balmoral to spend part of the summer with her. Princess Anne, Prince Edward and Sophie and princesses Eugenie and Beatrice spent time there last month.The Queen also showed her unquestioning support to Prince Andrew, who is embroiled in the scandal surrounding the late convicted pervert Jeffrey Epstein.William and Kate flew up with their three kids for a family break – somewhat pointedly on a Flybe plane – the day after the Sussexes went on that Ibiza trip in a private jet financed by Uncle Elton.Maybe Meghan simply doesn’t fancy the chilly BBQs and outdoorsy le at Balmoral. Harry’s mum Diana was never a big fan and I wouldn’t blame Meghan for not wanting to be part of the hunting, shooting and fishing brigade. But it’s the excuse of Archie being too young that doesn’t ring true.It was the same with Harry’s response to their flights on private jets when preaching to us all about reducing our carbon footprints. He claimed it was to protect his family but big bro William will one day be king and he took Kate and their three children on a commercial airline to Scotland.As I’ve said before, Harry and Meghan have good intentions and a lot to offer. They could do so much good but they seem to have lost their way and there is a growing disconnect between them and us that is really sad.WHAT the feck have we all done in a previous le to deserve the complete and utter balls-up currently being played out in our parliament  It makes the deranged and sweary TV comedy The Thick Of It look like a sensible political documentary.We have become a country full of people who are either permanently angry or completely and utterly fed up to the back teeth of the whole Brexit debacle. Or both.Family members have fallen out with one another after heated arguments over leaving the EU, including the PM’s nearest and dearest. This week Boris Johnson’s own brother Jo turned against him and resigned from Parliament as a minister and MP.Boris says he’d rather be dead in a ditch than ask for a Brexit extension but it’s increasingly likely he will be boxed into a corner and have no choice. So what then  Does he resign and run away again leaving some other poor sod to clear up the mess It looks suspiciously as though there’s no real plan and the whole motley crew are just lurching from crisis to crisis.  We deserve better.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And that reveals two things about Corbyn’s mob:First, they HAVE finally decided to abandon all their Leave voters. Second, they intend to insult their intelligence too, by assuming them too dim to see through such a transparent con-trick.Labour should simply state: “In power, we would scrap Brexit.” Yes, it would be shameful and, in a country where trust in politicians is already nearly the ­lowest in Europe, insanely dangerous.But at least Corbyn would for once be telling the truth.CAN the world’s worst loser Gina Miller really not hear her own revolting hypocrisy “I will not give up the fight for democracy,” she bleats as her legal bid to stop the PM suspending Parliament is chucked out.This is a rich woman using her millions to meddle in politics while refusing to stand for election. A woman bent on overturning the biggest mandate in our history because she doesn’t like it.A woman whose Remainer pals are running scared of an election Boris Johnson might win.The only vote they want is a second referendum biased for Remain. Butthey can get away with simply cancelling Brexit, all the better.Here’s the only democracy Miller likes:One where she and her powerful, know-all London friends get their way — and the ignorant little people can go to hell.“ANY EU citizens in Britain legally must be told unequivocally they can stay.”So said The Sun just after the  referendum. It was Vote Leave’s stance too.It is still Boris Johnson’s position now.“Under this Government,” he says, “they will have the absolute certainty for the right to live and remain.”Applying to stay is pretty straight- forward. Many have done so. But the number falling prey to Home Office carelessness or negligence is appalling.No one who has lived and worked here legally for years should be suddenly sent letters wrongly declaring them ineligible. Each one inflicts unimaginable fear and stress.Home Secretary Priti Patel must grasp that and fire officials who can’t get it right.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And I do too. Health, education and safer streets are what people need to get on in le, just as they were for me when I was ­growing up.The teachers who got me to study and work hard the police officers who kept us safe when the street I grew up in became a centre for drug dealers and the NHS that cared for my dad in his final days.As every parent knows, nothing is more important than giving your kids the best start in le.That is why I am providing schools with a cash boost to give every child a superb ­education, with the schools that have been historically underfunded ­getting the most.The NHS is one of this country’s ­shining achievements and all of us rely on the care, dedication and expertise of our amazing doctors and nurses.That is why the promises of more money we have made to the NHS are being delivered and why we are putting more money into social care, to give every older person the dignity and ­security they deserve.And to keep our streets safe, I have announced more money to fund our commitment to recruit , new police officers and create , extra prison places.This is the kind of thing that really matters to our daily lives — and it has all been achieved in just six weeks of this new Government.But there is, of course, one big thing that still hasn’t been done after more than three years: Delivering on the ­people’s instructions to leave the European Union.That is why we set a Brexit deadline of October , deal or no deal. We want to get on with it and focus on other priorities such as our public services. No more distractions, dither and delay.Unfortunately, that is exactly what ­Jeremy Corbyn and his allies voted for in Parliament last week, undermining our country’s negotiations with the EU at the final hurdle.Because of their actions, the only way to sort this out once and for all before the deadline would be to go back to the British people in a General Election.But after spending two years constantly calling for an election, suddenly Corbyn is trying to block that too.The day after tomorrow, in Parliament, he and the Labour Party have one last chance to do the right thing and stop running scared of the public.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He was charming, witty and fun to debate with.I think some women around the union or Oxford University Conservative Association were head over heels for him.Even today his is thought of as rather dishy in Tory circles with Made in Cha star turned Politico, Georgia Toffolo, describing him as a sex god.An unsurprisingly precocious child, JRM was interviewed on the today programme about finance when he was just -years-old.The keen capitalist, who already read the Financial Times daily and attended company shareholder meetings, was happy to appear on the programme for a fee in .Young Jacob asked the beeb to fork out £ for the interview and when they failed to cough up sent a letter threatening legal action.He wrote: “Dear Today programme, you are in a debt of £ which was payable as from   .“I have no idea what your excuse is but I will not accept it. If it is not received by    which is nearly two months, I shall increase it to £.“If it is not received within  days I shall take legal advice. I hope it does not come to that for I have no desire to prosecute the BBC.”When asked about the incident by The Sun last year, Jacob, now , described it as an error of his misspent youth.A friend who knows both Jacob and Louise claims that the chick lit author turned politico told them that Rees-Mogg had proposed to her but she said no.The pair were very close friends at Oxford and allegedly Louise seriously considered the proposal before turning them down.She would eventually go on to marry Anthony  LoCicero in  but orce him nine years later before hooking up with her current hubby, US businessman Peter Mensch.Jacob and Louise remain close to this day and are Godparents to one anothers children.A fan of the finer things in le, when Jacob was packed of to Eton as a -year-old he discovered he was unhappy with the bedding provided by the prestigious school.As a result, the future MPs now famous nanny, made frequent visits to the Berkshire public school to make his bed.Young Jacob preferred his own linen to the standard issue sheets doled out at the £,-per-year school.During his Far Eastern adventure in the world of Hong Kong finance, Moggy apparently got cosy with a young lady named Maria Butler.The pair apparently dined out together a few times and it seemed like one of the more serious relationships Jacob had had with a woman.But apparently the budding would be romance, which never became physical, was cut short after devoutly Catholic Jacob discovered Maria had been orced following a brief, ill-fated marriage in her early s. History buff Jacob once changed the last four digits of his phone number to , the year of Charles Is execution, to make it easier to remember.He revealed during an interview at the London Palladium with the Spectator that he opted for the number after moving into a new home.Jacob, who read history at Oxford, said: It’s important to have telephone numbers that people can remember.Soyou say to people ‘-the death of Charles I’ they know exactly what to call.As a great British politician, Mr Rees-Mogg obviously opted for a great British Motor.Jacobs dad, Times editor William Rees-Mogg spied a rather nice  T-Series Bentley first owned by former England cricket captain Gubby Allen.Following his death in , Gubby’s papers went on sale at an auction attended by Jacob’s father, a former Editor of The Times and a collector of rare books.It was there that he saw Gubby’s old car for sale and contacted the -year-old Jacob about a potential purchase.Jacob said: “Neither my father nor I knew anything about cars, but we dutully looked under the bonnet and there was an engine there but beyond that, our technical skills were not very great.I bid for it and got it and then realised that enjoying the car was probably going to cost almost as much as buying it”"},{"url":null,"title":"britain top 100 influencer gamers youtube","story":"The list, compiled by The Sunday Times, is based on how many loyal subscribers they have

Does that stop the Prime Minister sending other documents to the EU  I don’t think it does.“A political explainer perhaps, as to where the Government’s policy is. It has to make clear that the Government is asking for an extension, but let’s not forget what the next step is.There is a clear path now: the Europeans need to refuse an extension.But while Brexiteers and Remainers do battle in Westminster – Brussels is growing increasingly frustrated with the fiasco.Yesterday two top EU chiefs told MPs they will block any further Brexit delays as Brussels slammed the fiasco as unacceptable.Guy Verhoftstadt fired off the warning just hours after Frances foreign minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, said he would refuse any move to extend Brexit.It comes after the PM had vowed he would rather be “dead in a ditch” than go begging to Brussels for an extension despite the House of Lords passing a bill on Friday effectively blocking a No Deal Brexit.Verhoftstadt, the European Parliaments chief Brexit co-ordinator, said another delay would be unacceptable unless the deadlock in London is broken.He added: Let it be a nd ref., new elections, a revocation of art.  or the approval of the deal, but not today’s helpless status quo.On Sunday morning Le Drian gave Boris Johnson an unexpected boost when he said given the current situation, France would reject any extension.Speaking this morning to Europe , he said: The British say they want to come up with alternative solutions for withdrawal and No Deal, we have not seen them, so its no, were not going to do it every three months.And the irritated minister slammed the situation in Britain as disturbing, adding: Theres no majority for anything.News of the No plot comes after senior Tories said the government will obey by the law when it comes to their Brexit strategy.Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the PM would push the law to the limit.He told Sky News: We will adhere to the law but we will also, because this is such a bad piece of legislation, the surrender bill that Jeremy Corbyn backed – we will also want to test to the limit what it does actually lawfully require.Raabs comments came after chancellor Sajid Javid hinted the PMs team has a secret plan to leave the bloc by Halloween without legal dficulties.The Chancellor refused to be drawn into details of the plot but said Brits will have to “wait and see”.The warning from EU chiefs over the weekend is a glimmer of good news after a gruelling week in Westminster for Boris.His Brexit plans were dealt a blow when Remainers pushed their bill through the Commons – with the help of  rebel Tories.Then his brother Jo Johnson quit as an MP citing “unresolvable tensions” over the PM’s Brexit policy.Matters were made worse yesterday when Work and Pensioners Secretary Amber Rudd resigned over the PM’s purge of the rebels who voted against the government and supported the bill."},{"url":null,"title":"ae receptionist says life ruined","story":"NewsAE receptionist says her le is ruined after  botched ops at own hospitalLynne Hammond has been in four years of \"horric pain\" and claims mistakes were made in her careShareCommentsByConor GogartyKelly-Ann Mills:,  SEP Updated:,  SEP NewsLynne Hammond says the pain is horric \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for the purpose of sending you newsletters.

Lynne Hammond, a former AE receptionist at Southmead Hospital in Bristol, says she has suffered more than four years of “horric” pain because of alleged mistakes by her ex-employer. The -year-old doubted her own sanity when she was in long-term agony after a right hip replacement in July , as doctors allegedly told her there was no reason she should be in pain. But the screws in her hip were broken and loose for years. She has also had blood poisoning and a fractured pelvis – all of which she links to her hip replacement and subsequent operations at Southmead.    Lynne, mum to two grown-up children, was dismissed from her job at Southmead because she was unable to work. She says she is “practically housebound” and cannot walk without crutches after three right hip replacements. “I’m  and I don’t believe I will be able to work again, she said. It’s been absolutely horrendous.”Lynne had arthritis for about  months before her first replacement, but says her discomfort during that period was relatively minor.She said: “After the op, I was in a lot of pain. I said this to the consultant but they said my x-rays looked fine.” Lynne was in too much pain to go back to work and says she soon started to face pressure from the hospital’s HR department. She said: “I was put on half-pay after  months. They asked me to resign. They said evenI had cancer, I would only have one year to come back to work.    “I had a meeting with a surgeon at the hospital who said, ‘I have no idea why she is in so much pain.’” Her partner Nick Bawden, , added: “She was crying through the night. She spent time having to use a wheelchair. “Before the op she never needed one. She was doing -hour shts.” Despite a second and third opinion at the hospital, a cause for Lynne’s agony was yet to be identied. In July  her surgeon told her there could be “no harm” in having another replacement. She added: “I had the second operation, and afterwards the surgeon said, ‘No wonder you were in so much pain’. “I had one broken screw and three loose from the first replacement three years before.” Lynne says she was told she had metallosis – a buildup of metal debris in soft tissue – and blood poisoning. She added: “I had thought I was going mad, that the pain was in my head.” Lynne was released from hospital after a week, hoping she could finally recover. Instead, she says she was soon battling “the worst pain ever”. After more than six months of confusion over what was wrong, her doctor informed her she had a fractured pelvis.  “I had been walking round on a broken pelvis from the hip replacement,” she said. “The screw in my hip was broken and I had metallosis again. I was told I needed pelvis reconstruction and another replacement. “The surgeon said, ‘If the next op doesn’t work you will be left without a hip.’” The third replacement, last November, finally rid Lynne of metallosis, but she says she remains in “tremendous” pain, on extremely heavy pain medication and unable to walk without crutches. Lynne has struggled with depression and suicidal thoughts as a result of her pain. She filed a claim against North Bristol NHS Trust for clinical negligence and a hearing was set for October . The couple could not afford the legal fees and decided the risk of having to pay them was not worth it, so they scrapped the claim.

The -year-old, named Mel, shared the picture of mince with carrot and onions, accompanied with peeled potatoes. The traditional Scottish dish, Mince and Tatties, did not go down well with other social media users. One wrote: My dog wouldnapost even eat this s*** and he eats everything.  It was also labelled no deal Brexit in food form. Another said it looked like a meal from the Soviet Union in the s, while one person tweeted: Only white people conquer the entire world for spices and then donapost use any. Others suggested it looked like prison food, sparking sharp response from Mel. She said: If you think this is what they serve in the jail you’ve never done time kiddo.    Thai and Caribbean food are my favourite to cook, this is just nostalgic to me because my gran used to make me it, absolute fool. And she shared pictures of other dishes sheaposd made using seasoning and spices. The reaction wasnapost all negative though.

Sam Hemingway and Jordan Valentine say they were arrested and wrongly accused of people smuggling on their trip back to the UK. The holidaymakers, who went on a mini break to celebrate their engagement, were trying to board a ferry in Calais when immigration officials found the -year-old boy from Iran during a routine search. Hotel chef Sam, , claims he and restaurant boss Jordan, , were denied a solicitor, an interpreter and food after they were arrested and taken to a cell at a police station. They allege French police did nothing as anxious Jordan self-harmed in her cell in front of them.    Sam said he and Jordan - from Wrexham, North Wales, told the French officials that there was a fault with the car that prevented the boot from closing properly. Thataposs how the migrant managed to get in and hide hiding beneath the coupleaposs luggage, he said. He claims French officials told the pair that the migrant was a -year-old boy from Iran.    Sam said the couple were shocked and explained to immigration officials that they had no idea the boy was inside. The pair were held for two-and-a-half days, he added. Sam told the Times: We were shocked when they opened our boot, moved one item and he was there. Jordan started panicking. He was fully awake, and he wasnapost shocked to be found. I wasnapost angry that he had done it to us. I understand why they do it. But the way the French police treated us it was disgusting.  At mealtimes we werenapost offered any food, Jordan told them she self-harmed and they just watched her scratch her arms because they didnapost give her medication and she was anxious at being in a police cell. They laughed. Sam said they were askedthey wanted a lawyer and to see a doctor. They asked to see both, as his fiancée Jordan suffers from mental health problems, but neither materialised, he added. Sam told the Sun: “We were treated appallingly and we had done nothing wrong.  We were denied all sorts of simple human rights. “Then all of a sudden after two days the police released us with no apology saying the case had been dropped. While they were held police inspected the car at the ferry terminal in Calais and found that the locking system was easily compromised, Sam claims. He said they were finally released but the batteries in their mobile phones were dead and they were forced to walk five miles to retrieve their car.

Bully-proof your childNearly half of UK children feel bullying is a problem and more than , children are absent from school at any one time because of it. If your child has confided in you about being bullied, oryou suspect they may be, then it is time to take action. Children who are bullied are at much higher risk of developing mental health issues, and early intervention is crucial. ■ Reassure your child that the bullying isn’t their fault and explain bullies like to get a ­reaction, like making another person cry. By helping your child not react, you are enabling them to become bully-proof. ■ Kids can feel bullied when they fall out with friends, but these situations often resolve ­themselves without adult intervention. Consideryour involvement will be helpful before you rush to challenge the headteacher.  ■ Keep a bully diary and log every incident that your child discusses. This can be a helpful toolyou need to intervene as it’s a calm and practical way of demonstrating what your child has been going through. ■ Don’t tell your kid to just “get on with it”. This is really unhelpful and potentially harmful advice that will make your child feel worthless and responsible for their tough circumstances. ■ If you do speak to your child’s school and the staff fail to take action, get in touch with the Advisory Centre for Education , which will give you the support you need to take action. ■ Bullying can happen in many dferent ways and cyber-bullying is now one of the most reported forms. Check your child’s social media accounts, with their permission, from time to time and pick up on any cyber issues early on. ■ Get your child involved in groups outside school. This has been proven to help reduce the impact bullies have. Creating positive ­relationships outside of school builds confidence and self-esteem. Living le online Technology has plenty of benefits. However research shows that too much screen time and not enough of other activities, such as reading, playing games and imaginative play, can affect children’s ability to communicate effectively.  ■ If you want your children to be confident, communicative and ­creative, help them cultivate these traits. Timetable technology-free time every week so your children are used to being ­screen-free and excited about family fun time. ■ As kids grow into teenagers, technology becomes a major form of communication. While you may be worried about the amount of time your teens are online, communication is key to positive mental health and many children use technology for this purpose. Chatting to friends on headsets while gaming, or texting mates, shouldn’t be dismissed. Teenagers say it makes them feel connected and part of a wider support network. The social media trap Recent research has likened young people’s excessive social media use to drug addiction. While comparing Instagram to crack cocaine may seem dramatic, it still gives us food for thought. In the past decade, I have worked with many young people who feel their lives are going nowhere because they believe what they see on social media. Rather than spending time cultivating their own potential, they instead get depressed watching others succeed.    ■ Help your children understand the impact social media exposure can have on mental ­wellbeing. Encouraging them to take a ‘digital detox’ and switch off for a while will provide much-needed relief and the opportunity to explore emotions without feeling in ­competition with anyone. Ask your teens to commit to two evenings and one weekend day a week without their social media. ■ If they struggle to switch off, encourage them to go outside for a -minute walk, or to do some exercise. Being active promotes positive wellbeing and self-esteem and will benefit your child physically. ■ Your child may feel anxious about missing outthey turn off social media. I encourage all my young clients to practise mindfulness. This can be as simple as getting them to go on a walk in nature, or learning some deep breathing exercises. Is gaming dangerous  There is much debate around the impact of video games on children’s mental health. The evidence is mixed, with some research suggesting that there are more benefits than drawbacks, and other findings indicating the exact opposite.  Good mental health requires balance. The majority of children who play age-appropriate games, for acceptable periods of time, will most likely feel it benefits their wellbeing – particularly when it involves games that connect them to their online peer network. While gaming addiction is a ­recognised problem, the truth is you can’t create an addict. An inidual who is going to become dependent will find something to be reliant on. ■ Use common sense. Ask yourself an honest question – are they spending too much time online  If the answer is yes, how are you going to intervene and offer them alternatives  You can’t simply take away an enjoyable activity without replacing it with another. Kids love spending quality time with their parents, so think of games you can play together, walks you can take or films you can watch as a family. ■ Should your child appear lost in their online world, withdrawn, secretive or unhappy, it is essential you suggest alternative activities to help them re-engage with the real world. Why do kids self harm  Self harm is on the rise, with % of - year olds admitting they have purposefully harmed themselves. In the past two years there has been a % increase in - year olds attending AE for self-harm injuries. If you suspect your child is at risk, swt action is required. Children self harm as a coping strategy. It may be an awful one, but it is used as a means to cope, andyou take that mechanism away, they need a replacement. ■ Try not to fear the harm. While it can seem extreme, it is an outward sign of an internal struggle and your child’s way of dealing with overwhelming feelings. But take it seriously – it is not attention seeking for attention’s sake, but a need in the child that isn’t being met. Check they are not visiting pro-harm websites, as they can encourage more serious injury.

But the future of British Steel - which employs around  Teesside workers at Mr Caddy’s Lackenby plant and nearby Skinningrove - is still uncertain. And it means the -year-old sht operations manager is left wondering what the future holds for his family and the town, with one of his sons even thinking of moving away in search of work. Exclusivefigures reveal that the Redcar and Cleveland district is in the bottom  areas for deprivation in England. We want to hear stories from your town. What do you think about it  Are you facing any issues  Email webnews@mirror or call   .     The figures - obtained as part of the Mirroraposs unique five-day Town  series - also reveal that major North East towns such as Darlington, Hartlepool , Gateshead, Stockton-on-Tees, and Middlesbrough are in the fty most deprived parts of the UK. Mr Caddy, a union rep, has seen around , steel jobs vanish locally in the past decade. And he says veteran former steelworkers are left in a state of disbelief about the jobs they are being offered at minimum wage. “These are people who have been in the industry from leaving school and it’s all they know. Some of these guys are experts in their field… it’s not a transferable skill. “They are just being taken advantage of, they put messages up on Facebook saying ‘it’s just disgraceful.’” \u2028ICI’s nearby Billingham works was once the largest factory in the British Empire. The chemical giant was the biggest employer in the Tees Valley until it ceased operations in . See how your area ranks for deprivation with the Mirroraposs exclusive interactive map  Now steel is the main industry remaining on Teesside. When owner Greybull Capital bought privatised British Steel for £ three years ago it was supposed to be the rebirth of the struggling industry - but instead it collapsed earlier this year. \u2028Now the Caddys are among the steelworkers anxiously awaiting news of the future of British Steel’s sites at Lackenby, Scunthorpe and Skinningrove. It is a career that has offered a decent salary, a tight-knit community and a ready supply of consumers for the shops, pubs and businesses that sprung up around the steel heartland of Teesside. \u2028But the steel industry’s battle has figured heavily in the apparent decline of worker towns like Redcar.  The “zombie” steel furnace mothballed in  looms large on Redcar’s horizon and in steelworkers’ memories. And Mr Caddy says the collapse of industry has coincided with huge changes to the seaside town. “When I left school I started working on the high street in a clothing company, the town was always busy with shops such as Marks  Spencer, Woolworths, Hintons, but many of these have now disappeared and shops are looking either derelict or being taken over by charity shops or pound shops.  Mr Caddy now worries that more mass job losses would take the local economy with them. “The town would survive the closure, but in what form is the worry. We already suffer from reduced policing and increased crime. “People used to say when you left school you had options: British Steel or ICI,” recalls Mr Caddy. “On a positive the tourist trade due to seafront improvements, and micro pubs have been a boost for local economy. But retail is struggling.”    Where his family might once have bet on steel - Mr Caddy is now supporting his sons to create career backup plans that will act as an insurance policy for their futures. \u2028Josh, , already faced his first round of redundancy as a trainee. He is retraining for health and safety career which could see him need to move away from home in Redcar in search of work. Lewis, , is working for a local contractor. He completed an engineering course at college, and three traineeships, but at , Mr Caddy says he is still struggling to find work locally in that field, so may yet retrain again.\u2028\u2028  Mr Caddy thinks he will survivehe loses his job. But he is backing the UK’s steel industry fiercely. He is part of the Community Union campaign, which is calling on the Government to give business rates and energy price relief to the steel industry in hopes of preserving its future.  Mr Caddyaposs view is that carbon trading and tarfs imposed on the industry have only led to closures at home: “This is not solving the issue - itaposs just moving it around the world.” He says ignoring Teesside’s strategic position will imperil not only a proud community, but Brits who rely on affordable, quality steel for everything from the railways to the construction sector. “The current situation is not just about saving jobs now, itaposs sustaining jobs for the future and protecting a foundation industry. \u2028“If our country loses its last remaining capacity, then we’re held to ransom from external suppliers. We will always have a need for steel.” "},{"url":null,"title":"stunned doctors discover dozens mushrooms","story":"NewsDozens of mushrooms found growing in womans ears leaving doctors shockedWARNING: GRAPHIC IMAGES The patient complained of itchy and painful ears before doctors found the shocking causeShareCommentsByDave Burke:,  SEP Updated:,  SEP Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video doctors-find-dozens-mushrooms-growing-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,hidePreviewImage:,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,hidePreviewImage:\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for the purpose of sending you newsletters.

Mario Dzhambazov was hurtling along the A near Guisborough in Teeside when he hit a black Hyundai I on June . Semi-retired farmer Michael Liddell, , and his -year-old daughter Sarah, a mother of two, were killed in the high impact crash.Despite driving at such speeds that his BMW was airborne before it crashed, Dzhambazov walked away from the scene unscathed, Gazette Live reported .A witness spotted him speaking on his phone while a passerby attempted to help the dad and daughter. The -year-old was apprehended as he tried to walk away by a firefighter called to the scene.    Tragically, the dad and daughter were not supposed to be on the roads that day. They had driven to Nuffield Hospital in Norton where Mr Liddell was due to have an eye operation. It transpired they had arrived a day early. It was on the way home from the hospital that their Hyundai was hit. The force of the collision caused both cars to disintegrate, a witness said. Mr Liddell, from Moorsholm, suffered fatal injuries and was pronounced dead at the scene, with his daughter later dying of her injuries at James Cook University Hospital. Paul Abrahams, prosecuting, said CCTV footage and evidence collected after the crash allowed police to show that Dzhambazov had been driving at mph. Dzhambazov, a Bulgarian national, was in the UK visiting family at the time and had bought the  BMW i from his sister-in-law and was going to take it back to his home country. The sister-in-law had bought the car one month before the crash from a seller who told her it was scrap. It had been fixed up at a garage and picked up one day before the accident.

Ottery St Mary in Devon, a town of less than , residents, has been battered with heavy rain and thunderstorms over the past day. Police have warned people to avoid the area - and one mum has told how she feared she would die in the terrying flash flooding.A yellow weather warning has been issued by the Met Office , which predicts slow moving, heavy showers and thuderstorms will affect the area until pm.   Rachel Hine, , was waiting for a bus at pm when the weather took a turn for the worse. Within  minutes the rainfall turned into flood water, causing chaos for motorists and pedestrians. Rachel, a crèche assistant who had been attempting to get a bus back to Exeter where she lives, said: “It was raining most of the morning and then I left by boyfriend’s house at pm and it was still raining. I could see there were puddles but within  minutes it was really bad. It was very loud due to the sheer force of the water and I was getting soaked as water was coming up and through the bus shelter.  “It was scary being on my own because I was thinking I would drown as water was coming further up the pavement. By the time I left the bus stop I almost fell over from the force of water which was brown and murky and going quite fast. “It was half way up my shin as I walking across the road. By the time I got back my boots were full of water and I was absolutely soaked.” The thunderstorm is set to ease this evening. A Met Office spokesman said: “The yellow warning remains in place until pm, and East Devon is likely to see heavy downpours going into rush hour. “The rain then moves into the English Channel into the evening.

Mum Kaitlin Burgeaposs striking snaps reveal the reality of Beckettaposs battle against the disease, with one showing selfless sister Aubrey rubbing his back and reassuring him while he leans over the toilet being sick. Despite being just  months older, Aubrey washed her cancer-stricken brotheraposs hands, carried him to the sofa and offered to help clean the bathroom for her mum Kaitlin, , and dad Matthew Burge.    Mum-of-three Kaitlin said caring Aubrey shuns going out playing with her pals and would rather stay at home with Beckett so she can keep a close eye on him. She is thrilled with their incredible bond but admits to feeling sad that young Aubrey has been exposed to so much. Kaitlin, from the US city of Princeton, Texas, decided to share the heartbreaking images to show the importance of family in times of crisis.    Kaitlin said: When I see them together, it makes me happy but at the same time it makes me sad. They have an incredible bond. To this day, they are closer, she always takes care of him. A child thataposs four or five years old should be outside playing with their friends. She loves gymnastics and we had to put a stop to that because of the financial burden, it got too expensive with his situation.  She should be out doing gymnastics, running around the neighbourhood with the kids, playing in the playground, swimming in the pool - but here she is taking care of her brother. Theyaposre very close - they always played together. Heaposd play dolls with her and sheaposd play superheroes with him. We encourage her to go outside and do things, but sheaposd rather have her eyes on him. Beckett came home after more than a month in hospital on Aubreyaposs fth birthday.  He underwent chemotherapy, blood transfusions and platelet transfusions during his stay. Kaitlin said: Thereaposs a lot going on at the moment. When heaposs not tired and worn out Beckettaposs a very happy person, heaposs very bubbly and goofy. Heaposs never met a stranger - he will talk to anyone and anybody. But heaposs had a rough time and while he was in hospital, Aubrey went to her grandmaaposs house and his younger sister Chandler, whoaposs nearly two, went to her uncleaposs house.  Everybody was split up and they spent some time apart. When he came home it was the day of her birthday, it was her first time seeing him since he had been diagnosed. He was very petite, couldnapost walk and heaposd lost a lot of weight. To her it was very odd and he looked dferent. We werenapost really sure how to handle the situation orwe wanted her to know what was going on.  But whenever he came home Aubrey was trying to work out why he didnapost want to play - it wasnapost like him. The mum added: She wondered why he was sleeping all the time and needed help to the bathroom. He would just be sick and heaposd never been sick before. She didnapost know what was happening, but she knew from experience that when she was sick, we would rub her back and help her through it. She just picked up from experience and took over. Sheaposd rub his back and tell him it was going to be okay, clean his face up and wash his hands for him.  Right after that happened, she also carried him back to the living room and put him on the couch. She asked me she could clean up the bathroom too, but I told her to go and sit down because that wasnapost her job. She takes it upon herself to help and make sure everything he comes into contact with is clean. Sheaposs another set of eyes. Aubrey, who started preschool this summer, continues to worry about her best friend, despite her parentsapos reassurance. Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia affects the white blood cells and progresses rapidly and aggressively, the NHS says. Both adults and children can be affected by the cancer, which requires immediate treatment once diagnosed. It is very rare, with just  people diagnosed every year in the UK . Despite being rare it is the most common type of childhood leukaemia. In acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, large numbers of white blood cells are released by bone marrow before they are ready. The increase in blast cells reduces the number of red blood cells and platelet cells, causing the symptoms of anaemia, such as tiredness, breathlessness and an increased risk of excessive bleeding. Blast cells are not as effective at fighting bacteria and viruses, making patients more vulnerable to le-threatening infections and prone to uncontrolled and serious bleeding. Almost all children achieve remission and  per cent will be completely cured, according to the NHS. However, the outlook for adults is less promising, with about  per cent of people aged - surviving for five years or more after their diagnosis. Only about  per cent of those aged  or over will live for five years or more after being diagnosed.   Aubrey will look through pictures of her brother and ask questions about all the medical equipment surrounding him, desperate to have her play buddy back. Kaitlin said: We took pictures of him while in hospital and she scrolls through them on my phone. She asks a lot of questions, sheaposs a very smart little girl. Sheaposll go to picture and ask aposwhy does he have a mask on apos and weaposll tell her.  Sheaposs watched a dozen doctors throw a mask over his face, poke and prod him with needles, pump a dozen medications through his body, all while he laid there helplessly. She wasn’t sure what was happening, all she knew was that something was wrong with her brother, her best friend. We explain that he got really sick, this is what happened, it was nothing he ate or did, nothing she did, it canapost be prevented and itaposs not going to happen to her. We explained everything to her and got our social worker involved.  Weaposve been very open with her so any questions that she ever has we talk through it with her, we explain it with Beckett in the room as well. Heaposll tell people aposI have cancerapos, he knows what he has. We make sure sheaposs very supportive and knows it doesnapost make him any dferent. Sheaposs always worried about where he is, what heaposs doing, who heaposs with. Her having to do things by herself was not something she was used to doing and she didnapost want to do it. Since being diagnosed  months ago, Beckett has shown incredible strength despite having chemotherapy pills every night and needing regular hospital treatment.

We only allowed one goal five-on-five all weekend, so defensively it was good but our offence went dry.“I thought we generated a lot of chances against Fe but didn’t capitalise. Maybe we faced a hot goalie but, at the same time, we had a few chances we should have buried.“I warned the guys in the second that we had to play solid defensively and we had one breakdown and they scored.”On Saturday, Stars were just a goal down to Manchester Storm after one period as Tyler Fawcett scored on the powerplay.However, Dundee then gave up another two powerplay goals to fall - behind.Fawcett scored his second and Cam Critchlow added his name to the scoresheet before Dundee’s star man Elgin Pearce made it -.A scoreless third period was not what the Stars needed as Ryan Finnerty’s side killed off the game and sent the Dundee side home with nothing to show from their first Elite League game.On Sunday, both teams had full line-ups for their Challenge Cup clash and the first chance of the game went the way of the home side.Dundee’s Matt Marquardt drove through the middle of the Fe defence before flicking the puck across goal but his on-target shot was stopped by the arm of Adam Morrison in the Flyers goal.Egils Kalns was then denied by a spectacular save by Morrison as Stars continued to threaten early on.With no goals in the first period, a tense second stanza lay ahead for both sets of fans.Again, Dundee dominated the opening minutes but found no breakthrough.Later in the period, it was Fe who had the best opportunity as Chase Schaber forced Alex Leclerc to make a great double save.After  minutes of play it remained scoreless but Brett Stovin had a chance to change that  seconds into the third period as he went on a breakaway into the Fe end but Morrison pulled off a flashy glove save.However, Schaber broke the deadlock  seconds later.The Stars keeper spilt a rebound and a waiting Schaber quickly put the loose puck into the net to give the visitors the lead.The Stars were handed two late chances to equalise as Mike Cazzola and Jones both took penalties but their powerplay continued to falter.Danick Gauthier then sealed the victory for Fe with  seconds left on the clock, when he scored into an empty net.Pacha must now get his players to move on and begin to prepare for this weekend’s home double-header against Nottingham Panthers and Sheffield Steelers.Elsewhere in the Scottish National League, Dundee’s two teams were also on the losing side of their games.Dundee Tigers came up short in a close match with Aberdeen Lynx at home, losing -, while an injury-hit Dundee Comets were thrashed - by Solway Sharks."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/07/5d1dba5d3b6627.41351149.jpg ","title":"dundee uniteds goal machine shankland fit for arbroath cup tie","story":"Goal machine Lawrence Shankland will be available for Dundee United’s Tunnock’s Caramel Wafer Challenge Cup clash with Arbroath this weekend.Shankland made it eight goals in four league starts last Friday as he scored from the spot in the Tangerines’ crushing - derby win over Dundee.There was concern as he limped off  minutes from the end at Tannadice.United, however, have confirmed the problem was nothing serious and the -year-old is back in training this week.“It was just a cramp in his leg he couldn’t get rid of, so we took him off,” said assistant boss Gordon Forrest.“He did a great job in the game but when you look at our bench there are players who can come on and score.“Again it is credit to all the boys who are working hard in training and keeping themselves fit and sharp.

That’s disappointing.“We have been working on them as a team but in both the first phase and second phase of set-plays we got it wrong and we couldn’t deal with it.“Against Inverness earlier in the season we did really well against a really high number of set-plays over the two games against them.“So I didn’t see it coming but it’s happened and we will be better at it.“We work on that every week, it’s built into our training. It’s something I loved working on as a player, others don’t, but it is something we will continue to work on.“Anybody looking at the game clearly could see nothing was won or lost down there, apart from our pride and three points.“I know Robbie will say the same.

Scott is obviously disappointed that he is not going to be playing in these qualiers as they are two great games.“It would have been two brilliant games for him to go into.“However, I think the good thing is that when Steve took the Scotland job on he played Scott in the first two games.“He sees Scott as part of that .”The hamstring tear suffered at Kilmarnock was the latest injury setback to marr McKenna’s international career.The centre-back suffered a hamstring tear against Rangers in the opening game of last season that ultimately ruled him out of action for six weeks.That injury saw him miss Scotland’s opening UEFA Nations League clash against Albania and the friendly with Belgium last September.McInnes believes the recent injury was particularly cruel for McKenna as he was in good form despite the speculation over his Aberdeen future.McKenna had submitted a transfer request days before the English transfer window closed on August  for Premier League and Championship clubs.Nottingham Forest and Queens Park Rangers both had bids for McKenna rejected before he handed in the request.Sheffield Wednesday came in with a late bid on transfer deadline day that was also rejected for the defender who is contracted to Pittodrie until .McInnes said: “Scott’s level of performance have been very strong. Unfortunately he missed spells of football last season with two hamstring injuries and this is another one.“This is a similar injury to when Scott over-stretched itagainst Rangers here making a blocking tackle.“He has over-stretched it again having lost his footing on that pitch and is out for the region of three to four weeks.“It may be a bit longer, maybe a bit shorter, but Scott has been a quick healer in the past.”Devlin’s call-up came  hours after histo the Dons starting line-up for the first time in six weeks after a hamstring injury.McInnes said: “It just shows you need that squad and how it changes because Mikey thought he was not getting into my team a couple of weeks ago.“Mikey is now in charge of he jersey and he comes back in now and plays.“We know we can rely on Mikey when he is called upon.“It is great to have that quality in the squad to call upon when you have injuries.McKenna is one of five centre-backs ruled out of Clarke’s Scotland squad with John Souttarand Stuart Findlayboth omitted with injuries.Grant Hanleyand Liam Palmerwere called up but dropped out with injuries.In reaction Clarke called up the Dons’ Devlin, , and Hamburg’s David Bates, on loan at Sheffield Wednesday.Uncapped Devlin was previously in the squad last November and was set to earn his first cap only to suffer an ankle injury training with Scotland that would rule him out for three months.McInnes said: “What looked like an innocuous injury when he was away with Scotland saw him miss the best part of three months.“He missed out on the League Cup final, playing for Scotland and a number of key games for us.“For a young lad he has a lot of injuries to deal with but hopefully he will have better times ahead.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/08/5d6004abb61e43.23715313.jpg ","title":"logan and campbell fitness boost dons","story":"Aberdeen have received a double fitness boost with right-back Shaleum Logan and midfielder Dean Campbell both set tofor the next Premiership clash.Logan missed the - defeat of Ross County prior to the international break having undergone a minor procedure on a groin injury.The defender is on course tofor the next clash against St Johnstone at Pittodrie next Saturday.Teenage midfielder Campbell has been sidelined since the - League Cup defeat of Dundee with a hip injury.Campbell had to withdraw due to injury from the Scotland Under- squad to face Japan in Pinatar, Spain, in two friendlies as preparation gets underway for UEFA European championship qualying in October.However, Campbell is also set to be fit to face the Perth Saints.Dons boss Derek McInnes said: “I think Shay will be all right for St Johnstone.“Under medical instruction he was advised not to play against Ross County.“Hopefully we can get him back in contact training in the week building up to St Johnstone.“Dean Campbell will hopefully be fit for St Johnstone.”Logan’s expectedwill be a timely boost for McInnes who had only four fit defenders for the clash with Ross County.Centre-backs Scott McKenna and Ash Taylor were also sidelined with hamstring tears.The manager said: “You could see on the benchthere were no midfielders and no defenders. That was not through choice.”McKenna and Taylor are both set to miss the St Johnstone match.Taylor was on course toto action after the international break following more than a month out.However, he suffered a setback in his rehabilitation and will miss a few more weeks.McKenna is out for up to another three weeks.The injury, sustained in the - draw on the articial surface at Kilmarnock, ruled him out of Scotland’s Euro  qualier with Russia tonight and with Belgium on Monday.With the national team also experiencing defensive injury problems boss Steve Clarke called up Dons centre-back Mikey Devlin on Sunday night.Devlin and Sheffield Wednesday’s David Bates were added to the squad after Norwich City’s Grant Hanley and another Wednesday player, Liam Palmer, pulled out through injury.The defeat of Ross County was Devlin’s only first-team game time since suffering a hamstring injury in the - Europa League defeat of RoPS Rovaniemi on July .Devlin had  minutes for the Dons reserves’ - defeat of Ross County’s second string last week.McInnes praised him for his performance.

We do at the moment have a dentist and fully qualied staff and are happy with their work.Rumour has it that the aforementioned dentist and staff will be taking on patients from Mid Argyll Hospital, which I presume they tend to already.But the practice is to lose its local NHS patients, so they will deal solely with patients who require dental treatment from the hospital. I think this situation leaves the NHS patients in limbo.I am sure we would rather that the current dentist and all of her staff be given a chance to voice their opinions on this matter as much and as well as the local populace.Yes, it will be brilliant to have both dentists in the town. There is the possibility that those on the local list who are currently treated well by the dental department at the hospital maybe still seen by the dentist and her staff, but I would like this to be confirmed by the local NHS trust.Brian MacDonald, CrinanSir,Hundreds of people across Scotland have been helped through their exam results by a local group of Skills Development Scotlandcareers advisers.Based across the north of Scotland, the advisers were part of a team taking calls at the SDS Exam Results Helpline from am on results day.The helpline is a vital service, supporting young people and their families at what can be one of the most stressful times of their lives.Expert advice and guidance is available all year round, not just on results day.Our professionally qualied careers advisers are working in every state secondary school in Scotland and from our network of high street centres across the country.In schools, careers services are delivered one-to-one, in classrooms and at school events across all year groups, supporting young people to develop the skills to make informed career decisions throughout their lives.

It was fantastic to speak to so many of my constituents.It was also wonderful to see many local business stalls promoting Islay#s dynamic and booming economy.The show was well attended with lots of families, both local and visitors, having a fun day out and luckily the sun was shining most of the day.A huge thanks to all the organisers and everyone  who contributed to the event.Councillor Alastair RedmanSir,I have real concerns about the deteriorating condition of some Argyll cemeteries.Constituents from Islay recently joined Councillor Alastair Redman in highlighting the poor upkeep of cemeteries in the area he represents.Councillor Redman reported that there were also problems at other cemeteries in his ward, including the cemetery at Carradale in East Kintyre.I understand that Argyll and Bute Council confirmed that they now, at last, have plans in place to address the problems at Kilnaughton.It remains disappointing, however, that things are allowed to deteriorate to the extent that the maintenance of cemeteries has become a matter of public concern.Frankly, it is very surprising that a cemetery where interments are actually still taking place has been undermined in this way and there must surely be an obligation to ensure this doesn’t happen.My experience is that communities in the Highlands and Islands pay special regard to the final resting places of fellow members of their communities and will be perplexed to discover that they appear to be uncared-for.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSP"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures august 16 2019","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowTayvallich reader Colin MacInnes captured this photo of these two fluffy cygnets at the Corran Burn in Lochgilphead back in July.A couple of adult swans were spotted floating nearby at the time on Loch Fyne and Loch Gilp around Ardrishaig."},{"url":null,"title":"red star take derby spoils","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsRed Star welcomed local rivals Tarbert to the joint campus, and it was the Lochgilphead side who maintained their place at the top of the group thanks to a Stuart MacLean goal early in the second half.The first half of the game on Saturday August  began at a typically fast pace as you might expect from a derby clash-  but both sides were limited to efforts from long range which goalkeepers John Martin and Ally Lewis dealt with relative ease.The home side started to enjoy more possession as the first half progressed but were finding the well-organised Tarbert defence dficult to breach and were limited to efforts from distance which failed to trouble Martin in the Dookers goal.Star came out quicker at the start of the second half and looked to play at a much higher tempo. The deadline was broken on  minutes when Lee MacLean broke from midfield and managed to beat the offside trap, his cross from the left channel was met by the in-form Stuart MacLean whose shot beat Martin to give Star the lead.Tarbert looked to commit bodies forward in a bid to get back into the game which made for a more open contest, however the Star defence of Coll McCallum, Ricky Reid and Kyle Selfridge coped well throughout.Red Star should have made the closing stages a lot more comfortable for themselves with Gregor Peacock going close with a couple of opportunities and Aaron Moore having a shot well blocked but in the end Stuart MacLean’s goal was enough for a hard-fought but deserved win.On Saturday August  Star welcome Dunoon to the joint campus for their final game of the group stage, where a victory for the Lochgilphead side will see them progress to the quarter-finals.The kick-off time will be announced on the club’s social media pages during the week."},{"url":null,"title":"get dancing get fit and have fun","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowBack in April, the Mid Argyll branch of the Royal Scottish Country Dance Society held a ‘Bring a Friend’ evening.The result was a super evening of dancing and laughter, not to mention some delicious home baking at half time, and the branch was delighted at the number of people who came along.Now the dancing season is starting again after the summer break and the members are hoping to welcome those friends – and others – to their regular Monday evening classes.Scottish Country Dancing is a really great way to stay physically and mentally fit while having a lot of fun and listening to some lovely music at the same time.

These songs were associated with the Tlell River on Hai Gwaii in Canada. These tracks, with a selection of later collaborations, make up River to Sea from Tlell to Tiree. The title documents Sheila#s journey from the coast of Canada to Tiree, where the track All You Really Need is the Sea was written.This artist is probably best described as a folk blues singer. She has the sharply observing, descriptive eye of the classic singer songwriter troubadour and while her voice is given gravitas and character by time, she swings and has the timing of the blues singer.Wild Biscuit#s musical accompaniment gives Sheila#s characterful voice depth and presence.

Iain sensibly played short of the burn while Bruce had no option but to drive, splitting the fairway in the process leaving a  yard shot to the green. Iain#s second shot came up a bit short leaving him a dficult up and down, and the drama continued as Bruce almost holed his second shot to leave a tap in birdie. With nerves of steel, Iain chipped on to four feet and duly rolled in the putt for a well deserved victory of the Sam Andrews trophy.This was Iain#s first championship victory and in his acceptance speech he told the crowd of his delight at winning while complimenting the sterling work done on the course by Graham Prentice, John MacNab and Duncan Johnstone.Iain swept the boards, also winning the nett and senior championship at the same time. Captain Smyth also presented the John Reid Quaich to Duncan Johnstone, the James Johnson Cup to Iain Johnstone and the August medal to himself.Members were treated to a lovely buffet provided by Sheena, Georgie and Catherine, with celebrations carrying on late into the evening.Final totals: , Iain Macalister  , Bruce MacNab  , John MacNab ."},{"url":null,"title":"mid argyll course draws skippers and compliments","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowMid Argyll Radio Sailing put its toe in the water last Saturday when skippers arrived with their model radio controlled yachts from the club#s first competition.Several Scottish clubs # Ayr Bay Radio Yacht Club, Greenock, Rhu and Paisley # travelled to Mid Argyll joined by others from as far afield as the Preston area.A total of  yachts raced each other around the club#s Loch a Bahrain course near Cairnbaan.A steady wind from the south produced some exciting close encounters results and near misses.

Now I am not saying this is the simplest or even healthiest of activities. All this crouching, hand staining, pricked fingers and even eye strain.Often when you reach for a large black juicy berry it seems to disappear. It’s like the behaviour of politicians. They offer so much but when you reach for it # it disappears. Do you remember the Scottish government passed a law guaranteeing one would be seen by an appropriate health specialist within a stated limited time  The SNP government daily breaks this law – be it on cancer, accident and emergencies, or mental health.Or what about the promises made to the people of Arran and the Outer Hebrides on improved ferry services. The Scottish government is responsible for Caledonian Maritime Assets, CMal, which own and manage ferries. MV Glen Sannox was intended to commence service to Arran in  but lies incomplete for all to see in the Ferguson Marine yard in Port Glasgow. Part of the delay is because of disagreement over the fixed-price design and build contract for the two vessels.The SNP seems obsessed with this type of contract which has adversely affected schools, colleges and community centres. Worse still, while the SNP ridiculed previous government public private partnerships they have introduced a system clearly no better. What about the £. million each month we the taxpayers have to pay for the unopened Edinburgh sick children’s hospital  Jeanne Freeman, the SNP Cabinet Secretary for Health and Social Care, stepped in so late that she does not know whether this much-needed hospital will ever open.The second part of the bramble experience is the delicious mouthwatering bramble crumble. A crumble which gives joy and stimulation. Not like the crumbling state of the SNP government which has a sour taste and clearly disappoints.Finlay Craig, CoveSir,Your readers may be interested to know that there are currently  people in need of a kidney transplant in Scotland whose diet will be restricted due to kidney disease.It is likely that they will be on fluid restrictions of around just ml of liquid a day # including liquid found in foods like sauces and ice cream.

At that time her father was employed as an English teacher at Marr College, later transferring to the village school of Scotlandwell in Perth  Kinross.The family moved to the Borders when Mr Baxter took up the post of schoolmaster at Bowden School, eventually rising to become Director of Education for Roxburghshire County Council.The family set up home at Lindean, with Helenrsquos brother Sandy later taking over the running of Lindean Farm. Both siblings attended Lindean School, before moving to Selkirk High School.Helen undertook her basic nursing training at Edinburghrsquos Dean College, then studied for her midwery qualication at Bellshill Maternity Hospital, Glasgow. From there she headed to Jersey to serve as a midwe on the island, before ing to the Borders in the early s.In November, , she married Harry Russell, who earlier that year had been appointed Selkirkrsquos Royal Burgh Standard Bearer. The couple made their home in Lindean, with daughters Judith and Claire arriving in  and .Helen continued her nursing career at Galashiels Cottage Hospital and Peel Hospital, before taking on the joint role of district nurse  midwe for Selkirk and the Valleys, firstly based in the Nursersquos Cottage at Ettrickbridge, and then at Selkirk Health Centre.On call night and day, Helen Russellrsquos passion for the job - and her patients - knew no bounds.

Not only are volunteers providing fresh food for locals, they are also regenerating unused spaces, transforming them into lush green patches for all to feast upon. When filming wrapped, reporter Hilary Scott caught up with community gardeners Adam Skelton and Shirley Spence, to ask them how their gardens grow.THE High Street is the heart of the bustling town of Peebles.A derelict bit of land behind the former court building has been transformed into a tranquil greenspace and is now the Courthouse Community Garden.Adam Skelton told the Peeblesshire News: ldquoDuring the filming we discussed Borders Food Community Facebook Group which is a popular place for people to share food, plants, seeds, tools, and materials, as well as advice and information related to food growing, preparing, cooking and storing.ldquoAnyone can join the group free and there you can connect with lots of knowledgeable and very helpful grower, composters, cooks, preservers, picklers. The list goes on.ldquoWe also discussed land sharing. Various group members have allowed us to share their land and create group food gardens.And the Courthouse Community Garden is one of those havens.ldquoIt was an unused overgrown patch of land and we have converted it into a very productive little garden, explained Adam.ldquoThere is no contract or rent and we have not received any funding.The creation of this garden is down to the hard work of green-fingered volunteers and waste products, which Adam says is a ldquowin-win for all involved.He added: ldquoThe land owners get their land tended and access to free fresh food on their doorstep and we get to grow as we wish in this lovely space.Despite the success of Borders Food Community, Adam says he finds it odd that the vast majority of people are not eating truly local food when there are so many benefits.ldquoFor example therersquos the environment. There is no packaging or food miles, itrsquos so much tastier when fresh and all the nutrients intact and its better for local economy.Adam is very passionate about the work of community gardens and is encouraging locals to join Borders Food Community Facebook Group where they can discover their nearest community garden and get involved.The ITV crew headed to Innerleithen in the afternoon to discover a garden maintained by little and large green-fingers.Volunteers from community gardens across the Borders gathered at the Edible Garden along with St Ronanrsquos Primary School pupils.ldquoEveryone who wanted to got the chance to say a few words. It was great to have people from all the community gardens together in one place discussing more ways to collaborate together to further promote local food growing across the Borders, said Adam.The Edible Garden team were delighted to host the ITV Border Le crew.Shirley Spence said: ldquoWe enjoyed meeting the dferent groups of community growers and making new contacts. We were pleased with the comments and feedback about our garden and learning about other community gardens and their work in the Borders.And the children from St Ronanrsquos Primary School also enjoyed their moment in front of the cameras. ldquoThey were talking about what they liked to plant and grow and how gardening has encouraged them to try and eat dferent vegetables and fruits, explained Shirley.ldquoWe hope there will be many more initiatives for community growing starting up in other Border towns and villages.It might be a wrap for the film crew, but these community horticulturists continue to work hard growing fresh fruit and vegetables in their tasty gardens throughout the year.ITV will be airing the show later this month, and being involved in the creation of a community garden which is fresh, free and enhances the environment is a worthy  minutes claim to fame."},{"url":null,"title":"andy-set-toast-peebles-highland-games","story":"FORMER athletics coach

-bedroom hotel closed in  after owners Roy and Lorna Curry had failed to make the business profitable.Plans were submitted by Rikeja Ltd with the local authority the following year for an extension to be added and  apartments to be created.A spokesman said: \"The proposal to alter, extend and convert the hotel to form  apartments represents an appropriate use for the building restoring it to its

manner which not only preserves but also enhances the character and appearance of the building as one of special architectural character and appearance.\"The impacts associated with the proposed use of the property for residential purposes will also be signicantly less that those associated with its established use.\"Venlaw Castle was built on the site of Smithfield Castle in  by the Sherf Deputy

additional floor and also a baronial wing to the property.The castle was used as a Red Cross Hospital during World War I.And eventually, just after the Second World War, it was converted into an upmarket hotel.But a downturn in trade and several takeovers later the doors closed in December, .The plans for apartments, which were submitted the following year, won support from Scottish Borders Council at their planning meeting in March.Planning officer Ranald Dods said: \"The proposal as submitted is, on balance, not considered to be sufficiently detrimental to the character of the listed building to warrant a recommendation of refusal.\"The proposals contained in the planning application are considered acceptable.\"But continued concerns from Historic Environmental Scotland over the

Ryan McConnachie opted to go straight down the middle and evaded the e of the Dunoon keeper.There was a moment of worry at the other end, though, when goalscorer Souden also committed a handball in the Pupils’ box, and referee Peter Laing pointed to the spot. Dunoon halved the Pupils’ advantage, making it -.Then, just  seconds later, the Pupils restored their two-goal lead through Donald McCallum, who met left-sided substitute Kenny Kerr’s low cross to squeeze a shot between the Dunoon defenders and the frame of the goal.Soon after, the Pupils made it -, when Kerr guided another delightful cross onto the head of John McCallum, who guided an effort past the keeper from six yards, but it was the goal creator Kerr who was rightly mobbed by his team-mates.Not content with four, the Feathers-sponsored Pupils scored again, with # stand by # Kerr making it three assists in one match.Played in by McConnachie after some strong play in midfield by fellow substitute Michael McKinlay, Kerr set up young winger Ross Brown, who gladly tucked home goal number five with a close-range finish.With the match drawing to a close, McConnachie sealed his brace # and the Pupils’ sixth goal # with an excellent inidual effort, surging past a defender before rounding the hosts’ keeper and slotting the ball low into an unguarded net, adding gloss to an already emphatic cup win.After a great team performance, the Pupils will be hoping for more of the same tomorrowwhen they welcome a Tarbert side # who last week also defeated Dunoon # in a Kintyre derby.The match is scheduled for a pm kick off at Kintyre Park."},{"url":null,"title":"third round of tarberts golf championship","story":"Former champion Bruce MacNab held a four-shot lead going into the third round but a horror start saw the lead wiped out at the very first hole when Iain Macalister birdied and Bruce had a seven.Iain went on to birdie the second hole as well and despite the windy conditions was very much in control of his game over the first nine holes to be out in .John MacNab was also playing his normal steady game also ing , enjoying birdies at the st and th holes.After nine holes Iain had turned a four-shot deficit into a four-shot lead over Bruce and six ahead of John.Over the next four holes both Iain and John dropped four shots allowing Bruce some breathing space to claw back some of the deficit.When play was complete and all scores checked the totals after round three were as follows: Iain Macalister , Bruce MacNab , John MacNab .In the John Reid Quaich the silverware again headed south to Largieside with Duncan Johnstone retaining the trophy, shooting  nett over the two rounds.

Work is expected to start at the end of the month and should be completed by the send of September.Councillor Frank T. Spears stated that the work would not involve any long-term closure of the main roadway.The #dry bridge#, owned by Lord Margadale, has been the subject of much discussion and minor rows for the past several months. Since Western Ferries Ltd. began their sea service, heavy articulated lorries carrying malt and grain to the island#s distilleries have been unable to go under the bridge. Matters came to a head three months ago when Argyll County Council re-imposed a weight limit on the Glen road # the ersion used by the transporters to avoid the bridge.The bridge owners came quickly to the rescue and allowed the heavy traffic to use their private road at Bridgend for a three-week period, but following local protests and legal consultations the transporters were again allowed to use the Glen road.Leboat saves three on rocksThe crew of a lobster fishing boat were marooned on a partially-submerged rock for more than two hours when their vessel foundered off the north-east coast of Islay on Thursday morning.The ft #May#, owned and skippered by -year-old Mr Lachlan Clark of Port Charlotte # the veteran of several sea-dramas # struck the rocks while they were lting lobster creels.The Islay leboat was called out to rescue the skipper and his crew # Alastair MacDonald, a -year-old fisherman, and Norman Gardiner, a -year-old Colonsay doctor#s son who was making his first trip and deputising for a sick crew member.Following the rescue, the crew # who were unhurt # were landed at Port Askaig.ONE-HUNDRED YEARS AGONational Health Insurance ActA number of contraventions of the National Health Insurance Act were the subject of prosecutions in Campbeltown Sherf Court on Thursday # Sherf MacMaster Campbell on the bench.The first case was that of a Clachan merchant who was charged with neglecting to stamp the card of a female servant.Mr M. Dick, solicitor, who appeared for accused, tendered a plea of guilty, and said the observations he was about to make would apply equally to all the cases subsequently to be heard. These were the first prosecutions of the kind in this court. The Act, as his Lordship knew, was a most voluminous and complicated measure.The sherf observed that some excellent and very lucid summaries had been circulated.Mr Dick, proceeding, asked his Lordship to examine the contribution card. He would find that the part which was the very kernel of the offence was embodied in the middle of Art.  in very inconspicuous type. The employer was there required to stamp the card #not later than the time at which wages are paid# but to read that one required to hold the card at about  degrees.The sherf askedhe was to understand that this was the first occasion on which a domestic servant had been employed by accused  If not, he must have been trained in the use of this wonderful document years ago.Mr Dick said his Lordship must consider this, that in cases of this kind there were two standards of clearness. What was clear to the judicial mind might be very far from clear to the lay mind.It was a matter of common knowledge that there was a very general belief in this part of the country thatinsurance cards were stamped at the time they were run out the Act would be complied with.The card, of course, bore that the stamps must be affixed #not later than the time wages are paid#. He asked his Lordship to consider the phraseology. These cards came into the hands of many rustic employers of labour. Why should it not be stated in bold characters on the card that the stamps must be affixed at the time wages are paid In the country wages were paid sometimes by the half-year, sometimes by the month, and sometimes at irregular periods suitable to the circumstances of the worker.The cards represented not the half-year of the feeing terms, but the calendar half-year. All these circumstances contributed to the confusion of the lay mind, and encouraged the widespread impression thatthe cards were stamped at the end of the period the duty of a citizen was thereby fulfilled."},{"url":null,"title":"leader august 23 2019","story":"The Courier is honoured to deliver news to the community # during the good times and the bad.This week we were delighted to share the news that Campbeltown now boasts the #whisky bar of the year#, according to judges at the Scottish Bar and Pub Awards , who bestowed the title to the Ardshiel Hotel.Since buying the hotel more than a decade ago, Flora Grant and Marion MacKinnon have more than tripled the number of whiskies on offer, turning the hotel into something of a tourist attraction in itself.However, we also revealed that nine jobs have been lost at Campbeltown Creamery.While it is still hoped that a take-over by local farmers is the future for the site, it is terrible for the iniduals who have lost their jobs, some after many, many years.We know there is a market for Campbeltown cheese, and while the number of farms supplying the creamery has fallen over the years, there are still almost .Here#s hoping the future is bright for both Campbeltown#s whiskies and cheeses."},{"url":null,"title":"fun in the sun at first mokfest","story":"India enjoyed herself at this year#s Up The Close event, which included children#s entertainer Funky Chicken and ious fair attractions, and was made all the better by the glorious sunshine.India was joined by her mum Lynsey Mcshannon, who was able to get into the spirit of things this year having been heavily pregnant last year, and her dad Gary Anderson.This year#s Up The Close was a particular hit, with the welcome , after nearly a decade, of indie rockers a new hope "},{"url":null,"title":"more music in store for the wee toon","story":"On Wednesday, September  at .pm, well-known folksinger, entertainer and broadcaster Alastair McDonald will be in concert in Campbeltown Free Church.This will not be Alastair’s first visit to the Wee Toon.

subsequently had his eyes tested by police officers and the court heard he had ldquoprovided a negative breath test following the incident.Defending solicitor Mary Moultrie said that her client had taken ldquoevasive action by pulling onto the opposite carriageway after realising he could not brake in time.Ms Moultrie added that Steedman ldquobelieved his brakes had failed at the time of the collision but afterwards realised he ldquomust have put his foot under the brake pedal.The lawyer said that Steedman had had a clean driving licence for the past  years and had been driving at a ldquovery low speed when he struck the three children.Ms Moultrie added: ldquoThis a genuine one-off, isolated incident that is very regrettable.Sherf Peter McCormack agreed and sentenced Steedman to

When the corn was eventually gathered in early September, it is said decaying corpses were discovered. They had lain in the fields since August , a day of barbaric infamy in Tranentrsquos history. The dead were victims of the Tranent Massacre, and one of the bodies may have been that of Jackie Crookston or Crookstone.I say lsquomayrsquo for there is ironically so little known about this well-known woman. A statue by David Annand of Jackie on Tranent High Street shows her beating her drum with a clenched fist, defiantly leading the protest against the Militia Act. The plaque by the statue calls her a ldquoresolute woman who joined the protest, and states she was one of those killed by the cavalry.Her heroic reputation is well established in local lore. The th-century historian John Martine called her ldquoa Tranent virago. This word describes a woman of brave, fearless qualities, but it has a sting in its tail. It can also be used to mean a woman who has overstepped her mark, broken cultural rules in relation to her role as defined by gender.And by leading the protest against the Militia Act she most certainly did this.Another th-century historian and collector of traditions, P. MrsquoNeill, was clear on her role: ldquoJackie indeed was the prime mover in the whole affair, he states.We have accounts of her beating her drum and leading the protest with chants of ldquonae militia. She is said to have threatened a captain of the cavalry and declared defiantly that ldquoshe didna care a pin though she were cut in halves, she wad hae nae militia. Another account has her telling a member of the yeomanry to leave or she would ldquothraw his neck, at which he duly rode off.If these accounts are true, she was indeed resolute on that day in defending her family, her neighbours and her community. Jackie was not the only woman on the streets that day, for women took a leading role in defending their families. But she was the most prominent, it seems.The Militia Act aimed to conscript young men into a militia by means of a ballot. It was resisted for a number of reasons, but for the poverty-stricken mining and farming communities of Tranent and the surrounding area, it was seen as an imposition which would take young men of working age away and potentially cripple their families economically.There is no space here to recount the details of the massacre, but much of what happened on that day remains hidden behind a mist of cover-up and official indference.And somewhere in the bloody carnage of August , , Jackie Crookston was killed, along with many others. Yet despite her leading role, her name was not included in the original list of people killed. Eleven deaths were recorded, but no mention of Jackie. ldquoHow her death escaped recording is dficult to explain, reflected P. MrsquoNeill in his book Tranent and its Surroundings.Perhaps an explanation can be found in an eyewitness account written immediately after the massacre. It was a letter from Archibald Roger to his we in Edinburgh.It begins: ldquoDear we, this comes to acquaint you that you need not weary for my ing home, for my sister is to be buried this afternoon at four orsquoclock, and I cannot come away till I see her decently interred. I am sorry to inform you of the cruelties that were committed here yesterday there were six persons shot dead on the spot, of which my sister was onehellip the number of wounded is not yet ascertained, but I am just now informed that  dead corpses were this morning found in the corn-fields and it is not known how many more may be found when the corn is cut.Was Jackie one of those lying undiscovered in a field  It seems so by some accounts. Is that why her death was not on the list  Sandy Mullay in his book The Tranent Massacre says she was shot in the streets, but there is also a tradition which states her body was found well away from Tranent much later in a field, with stab as well as gunshot wounds.Was she initially wounded and then a victim of later retribution  Was she hunted down in an unrecorded atrocity because of her role as ring leader, and a woman who didnrsquot know her place  She will have been easy to identy because of her prominence in the protest.Her death, just like her le, is unrecorded by history. Despite her leadership in the events, she was a woman and she was poor, and history lacks interest in such characters. A tax on the registration of births and deaths at this time meant many poor people lived and died unregistered even in parish records.So who was Jackie  We know she was born in Gladsmuir in June  and was a mother. Perhaps not all her children were registered because of the tax, but it seems she had at least four surviving at the time of the massacre. She was only  when she died, but how do we imagine her le  What was behind her passion in defending her community When I spoke of her to artist Mags Nisbet-Macfarlane, she was inspired to use art to search for the woman behind the historical glimpses.ldquoI felt connected to this woman I did not know, she told me, ldquoshe will have had a le that explains her defiance that day she had so little, but was protecting what was important to her. Magsrsquo image of Jackie tells a story without the need of words.The plaque by the statue in Tranent says there were  killed in the massacre, as Jackiersquos name has been added to the original . But in truth we will never know for sure how many were really killed and maimed that day.There was no prosecution of those responsible, no investigation and no interest by those in authority to allow the truth to be told."},{"url":null,"title":"up-and-coming-band-go-first-scottish-tour","story":"Johnny Brown and the Devanties, made up of frontman Johnny Brown, , Erin Ritchie, , Andrew Dobie, , and Struan Blacklock, , will be heading to Aberdeen at the start of next month on the first gig of their headline tour.Johnny told the Courier: ldquoIrsquove been singing and writing music since I was about  years old.ldquoI knew the tour manager for The View so ended up playing a few gigs with them.ldquoIrsquove played the EH festival and once I had the chance to play with Republica.ldquoIn January I reconnected with a few people I went to school with through the music scene and we decided to form the band.ldquoWersquove released one single and our next one, Streetlights, will be released after the tour.Johnny of Edinburgh Road, Cockenzie, met his fellow bandmates while at Preston Lodge High School.He said: ldquoWe had to make sure that we were able to sell out shows before we knew we could tour.ldquoWe sold out about seven gigs in a row, so thatrsquos when we thought we should give it a go.The bandrsquos first single, Brooklyn, was released just after they were first formed in January and garnered good reviews, in particular from Discover Music, Scotlandrsquos Music Blog.As to the future, Johnny said: ldquoWersquore hoping our tour and our new single will do really well, hopefully itrsquoll help us break through.

Last weekend, we were fortunate to be invited to an orchard in East Lothian to pick some apples.As we entered Lewis stopped for a moment and said ldquoWow.He has seen apples growing on trees before, but I think it was the sight of so many apple trees together all in fruit. It was a visual feast, even for me.And so we picked some apples, in the company of a friend who uses local fruits to make juices. Lewis just couldnrsquot decide which apple tree to pick from first. He wandered about in awe, eyeing the apples.There were many ieties in the orchard, but I sadly canrsquot remember all their names.ldquoI think Lewis is in paradise, I remarked as I watched him.ldquoWhatrsquos paradise  asked my nearly six-year-old inquisitive daughter Skye. I had to think about my answer.ldquoSome people say itrsquos a perfect place, but other people say itrsquos a perfect feeling.ldquoCan be both then, maybe at the same time Skye replied.I smiled and agreed. We both watched Lewis, as he wondered under the small trees, dancing with delight at the sight of so many delicious looking ripe apples.ldquoYea said Skye, ldquoLewis is definitely having paradykes.ldquoWe say in paradise I said, in a bit of a teachery tone.ldquoBut you can have it too insisted Skye ldquobecause itrsquos a happy feeling.How could I disagree  ldquoYoursquore right I smiled.ldquoThis one Lewis called out. The apple was just out of reach and so his sister ran up and carefully picked it for him, in the way she had been shown. Lewis studied the apple before eating, savouring the moment.He was indeed both in, and having, paradise.We collected a small basket full of apples of dferent ieties, and after giving our thanks we started our walk back to the car. As we meandered along the path Skye asked for a story about an apple.So I told the story of Johnny Appleseed. Then a riddle ldquoA wee roond hoose, sometimes red, sometimes green, the maist bent lum ye hae ersquoer seen. Nae windaes or doors tae open or slide, it has a secret, therersquos a star inside.The answer of course is an apple. The bent lumbeing the stalk, and the star being the seed core when the apple is cut horizontally through the middle.As we walked, I reflected on the symbolism of the apple, and how it has been used in folklore and legend. And of course there is the famous apple which fell on Newtonrsquos head.Well it probably didnrsquot really fall on his head, as that seems a later embellishment, but for sure Newton himself often told the tale of the falling apple and the inspiration it gave him. He lived well into old age, and I think he understood the power of a story to convey the meaning of an event or idea.We approached our car and I took my sonrsquos hand to keep him safe as we crossed the road.ldquoDad he said looking up at me, ldquoyou are my walking apple.I laughed at the image and wondered what he meant. Was he referring to my rotund body shape perhaps ldquoWhy am I your walking apple  I asked him.ldquoCause I love apples and you are walking with me he said, with a sense of poetic meaning only a young child can convey.I was momentarily overwhelmed by this simple but moving comment. Lewis, aged only four, conveyed a powerful symbolism for apples that morning.The apple falling from the tree in front of Isaac Newton was a symbol of scientic discovery.

In part, this could be because her fiction is risky, challenging, sometimes riotously funny, but as often sizzling with rage. Her titles include Man or Mango , Dot in the Universe, and Mimi, savage satires on gender politics which are nevertheless also filled with tenderness and optimism. Her fondness for emphasising words in capital letters or italics has irked some critics, who prefer the page to look ordered and calm. But since when was fiction a form of beta blocker  With Ellmann, you feel yoursquove had an injection of adrenaline, quickening your heartbeat and bringing the world alive.Compared with her other novels, Ducks, Newburyport takes something of a new turn. As always, a woman is at its heart, but in this instance, instead of a slim work, it is big: just shy of , pages. Told by an Ohio housewe, who bakes her way through the tale, it is a stream-of-consciousness portrait of modern-day America, in all its confusion, consumerism, and cupidity. A y glossary of abbreviations is appended, ranging from Ato ZPGby way of IHPand WMD . You get the picture.Theof the story is ambitious enough, but asshe needed something more to spur her on, Ellmann has written the entire book ndash barring the opening passage ndash in a single sentence. Does this sound intimidating  Probably. Or make the book hard to read  Not at all. It is like stumbling on an oasis in a desert, a refreshing, invigorating, restorative immersion in a piece of remarkable, thoughtful and truly innovative fiction. Too many headline-grabbing novels are dull and predictable, enervating rather than enjoyable, derivative when they should be daring. Such tedious stuff makes you forget that the original meaning of the word novel was something dferent, unique, and new.Thankfully the Booker  has recognised a work of exceptional talent. Its presence on the shortlist adds lustre to a prize that has been dogged over the years by accusations of mediocrity and popularism, charges that last yearrsquos winner, Milkman by Anna Burns, helped to refute. Ellmannrsquos fellow shortlistees are prestigious, including Margaret Atwood and Salman Rushdie, both of whom have won before, along with El Shafak, second only to Orhan Pamuk in Turkey for international acclaim, British writer Bernadine Eisto, and the Nigerian Chigozie Obioma, shortlisted for his second novel, as he was with his first.The competition is stf, but already statistics are being trotted out: were it to win, Ducks, Newburyport would be the longest to prevail in the historyrsquos prize, beating even Eleanor Cattonrsquos doorstopper, The Luminaries, by more than  pages. Apart from their size, however, these two novels are poles apart. There is nothing conventional about Ducks, Newburyport. Indeed, Ellmannrsquos literary credentials can be traced back to James Joyce, the exemplar of stream of consciousness, where the reader has to surrender themselves to the flow, trusting the author to keep their head above water until they reach their destination. In the fluidity of Ellmannrsquos prose therersquos an echo of Henry James, with his sharp and self-conscious interrogation of America. Therersquos a nod to Virginia Woolf too, but Ellmannrsquos wit and acerbity, her scorching political lens, are all her own.The direction her style has taken is perhaps no surprise. Ellmannrsquos late father Richard was a world-renowned expert on Oscar Wilde and Yeats, but above all on James Joyce. His biography of the myopic Dublin genius has never been surpassed, remaining one of the most acclaimed literary biographies of the last century. The linguistic poetry and emotional range of Joyce, who must have been an invisible but constant presence in the Ellmann household, seems to have got under his daughterrsquos skin at a formative age.The announcement of the Booker Prize next month, on October , will mark  years to the day since its only Scottish winner, James Kelman, took the prize in  with How Late It Was, How Late. This was a highly contentious choice, not just because of its interior monologue narration, but also its liberal use of the F-word, which horried one uptight judge. The controversy it sparked has never been forgotten. These days, though, you canrsquot help thinking the title sounds like a lament for the lapse of time between Kelmanrsquos success and that of anyone  living north of the Border.There is no doubting Kelmanrsquos status as one of our finest novelists. Along with Alasdair Gray, he is an obvious contender for a Nobel Prize, though the chances of that idiosyncratic telescopersquos lens turning in this direction seem slim. Unlike many others, winning the Booker did not make Kelman rich or famous. It did, however, raise his profile internationally, and set a benchmark for those keen to add something memorable to the literary cairn.Ducks, Newburyport certainly does that. Other than in their tireless search for a mesmerising and distinctive way of expressing themselves, at first glance there is little obvious common ground between this pair. It is only when you read their books and recognise their seemingly effortless brilliance that you realise how similar, and rare, they are.In the acknowledgements at the end of Ducks, Newburyport, Ellmann thanks ldquoEdinburgh City Council for my Saltire card, a dandy aid to the impecunious. Itrsquos a cheerful reminder that unless yoursquore a bestseller, the literary le is not deluxe. Yet listening to the naturalness of her narratorrsquos voice, and the stories she tells, makes you grateful that the writerrsquos feet are firmly on the ground, be it a New Town pavement, No.  bus, or mid-west America, where the future is unfolding fast."},{"url":null,"title":"face-face-bake-off-star-cookery-writer-james-morton","story":"But Super Sourdough is not, he stresses, a recipe book.

What I like is to hopefully convey a deep understanding and an appreciation for everything about bread, from all the dferent ingredients to the microbiology behind it.Asthat task wasnrsquot challenging enough, the -year-old Shetlander combines the endeavour with le as a full-time doctor. In fact when we speak he has just finished a sht at Glasgowrsquos Queen Elizabeth hospital, part of an ongoing rotation which in two yearsrsquo time will see him qualy as a GP. He originally intended to train as a surgeon but has since changed to general practice. Why the switch from theatre to waiting room ldquoIt was partly to do with a work-le balance, he says. ldquoBut part of it was just the attraction of being a GP. There arenrsquot enough GPs and it can be a really rewarding medical speciality ndash a lelong relationship with your patients. Also the dream of having an awesome GP practice with good coffee and good bread sounds good.Talking of work-le balance, how does aover-worked junior doctor find time to bake sourdough, feed images of it to a voracious Instagram pageand also write about it One reason is that he just loves making bread. ldquoWhen it goes well, making a really good loaf of bread is the best feeling in the world, he says. ldquoThe only issue comes when you get as into it as I am now. You become a bit of a perfectionist and when things donrsquot go well ndash and inevitably things donrsquot go well occasionally, when Irsquom trying a new thing or just having a bad day ndash then itrsquos really disappointing. Especiallyyoursquove had a bad day at work and you come home and the bread thatrsquos in the fridge waiting to be baked is rubbish. It can be a bit of a downer. But bread-making itself is usually extremely rewarding and can be fitted in very easily around a busy le.Therersquos another reason too. ldquoI like to make the most of an opportunity and all the things that have happened to me ndash Bake Off, the books ndash have presented quite an opportunity.Ah yes, The Great British Bake Off. If you recognise the name or the face itrsquos because Morton featured on the showrsquos third series in . He was still a student at the time. You many remember his Parsnip, Pear And Pecan Upside-Down Cake, his Orange, Mint And Chocolate Bagel or his Whisky Kugelhopf-Brioche Baba, which won him top spot in the Sweet Dough round and helped him into the final, where he finished runner-up to eventual winner John Whaite. You may also remember his jumpers, which caused almost as much of a stir as the ill-fated Gingerbread Barn that collapsed on itself in the tense quarter-final. For The Daily , he was the ldquospeccy, cardigan-clad Scottish medical student who became ldquoan unlikely heart-throb.Applying for the show was ldquoa punt, says Morton. ldquoI was encouraged by most of my friends to go on. We were all good bakers, but they thought I had the most USPs, being from Shetland, being male ndash which was unusual on Bake Off at the time ndash being young, being a bread maker, having interesting things to say. I suppose all these things just ticked boxes.Even so, the selection process was arduous and rigorous. Even at the last hurdle there were still  prospective candidates vying for just  places, so each one had to go through a screen test and a simulated Bake Off round complete with judging by Paul Hollywood and Mary Berry.Morton made the cut. Did the jumpers help  ldquoI just wore those jumpers anyway, he protests. ldquoThey were just Shetland jumpers. People seemed to think I was putting on some kind of character or, worse, was encouraged to be a sort of character by the TV people. But no, that was just me. I still wear them.BORN in Inverness and raised in Hillswick, on the Northmaven peninsula, Morton is the son of Tom Morton, the cultural polymath whose CV includes broadcasting, journalism, writing, and music. With his books and his double bass ndash hersquos a former member of the National Youth Orchestra of Scotland ndash Morton Jr. has already ticked off three of those four occupations. His mother, meanwhile, is a GP, so perhaps thatrsquos where the interest in medicine comes from.The love of baking, however, is rooted in a previous generation ndash Mortonrsquos grandmother ndash and also in the culture of Shetland itself, where food and the sharing of it knitscommunities together, whether itrsquos sweet ldquofancies or Shetlandrsquos trademark mutton soup.ldquoMy gran, when she was alive, lived  yards down the road from us and I used to go round there every day after school. Thatrsquos where I got my love of baking from. Gran would bake Apple Pie, Lemon Meringue Pie, Victoria Sponge, things like that. Wersquod do that on an almost daily basis. Irsquod drink a lot of tea and eat a lot of Jaffa cakes as well.Later he worked in kitchens in hotels and restaurants in Shetland and he did the same when he moved to Glasgow to study medicine. And it was in Glasgow that he was first introduced to sourdough bread, courtesy of a baker called Davie who lent him two books. The first was Dough, by celebrated Breton baker Richard Bertinet, now based in Bath where he runs The Bertinet Kitchen. The other was Bourke Street Bakery, published by the founders of the Sydney bakery of the same name. Fatefully, Davie also gave him a blob of his eight-year-old sourdough ldquostarter. Morton started making sourdough at home and was soon hooked. He still is. ldquoSourdoughrsquos something I absolutely love and get addiction to making, he says. ldquoI make it about three times a week on average. If you look on my Instagram page, therersquos a lot of bread.But Mortonrsquos promotion of home-made bread is about more than artisanal one-upmanship or the creation of Instagram-ready food porn. Just as his interest in science has driven him to try to understand sourdough at a molecular level, so has his medical knowledge made him aware of the wider issues concerning bread. Think smashed avocado on sourdough has no place in discussions about public health  Think again.ldquoMost of us are in medicine to make a dference, to make people better, healthier, happier and public health has the biggest potential for that, he says. ldquoWhat we do in a day to day basis is important, but itrsquos small fry compared to mass changes in society ndash things like changing whatrsquos considered acceptable when it comes to processed foods.And therersquos little in our diet which is more processed than our beloved white bread. Just last week it was revealed that a -year-old boy in Bristol went blind after existing on a diet of chips, crisps and white bread.Morton is well aware of the many inidual health issues linked with poor diet, from bowel cancer to type  diabetes, but at a national level he thinks obesity is the more pressing issue. ldquoWe get a bit obsessed with these other things because they make good headlines but the biggest thing is obesity and getting people to lose weight to be healthier. Bread gets a bad reputation ndash itrsquos carbs ndash but actually good bread yoursquove made yourself thatrsquos chewy and enjoyed in moderation is certainly part of that.Perhaps, then, itrsquos not whatrsquos on your piece thatrsquos important ndash itrsquos what itrsquos made with.

Most UK manufacturers are not part of that and tend towards the high end of the market. But customers need to know the dference.One question will be how to change the mindset of customers, she adds.ldquoWe want to know what influences young peoplersquos choices. What would make young people consume something more sustainable and fairly produced  Young people are well aware of climate change and are concerned about the future. Many are eating well, and take an interest in ethical farming practices. But they may be less aware of how to lobby for fairly made garments.On the other had there are also online social media lsquoinfluencersrsquo wearing clothes and more or less throwing them away days later, she says. ldquoSocial media has a role. If you can have three dferent outfits delivered to your door, do you know what the carbon footprint of that is, and of sending them back again But consumer decisions are not always a simple as they might seem, she adds.ldquoIt is not necessarily simply a case of choosing an organic T-shirt rather than a non-organic one. The organic one can take three times as much water to produce. If it is produced somewhere where there is a water shortage, that T-shirt may not be as friendly and sustainable as you think.One issue on the table could be eco-labelling schemes, she says. Could ethical ratings for clothes ndash as pioneered by London fashion brand Mother of Pearl ndash become more widespread Smaller brands can often act more quickly than large brands, but the impact of change at a larger brand can be bigger. A speaker from Adidas will tell the conference about Ocean Plastic, its trainer line made out of harvested marine waste which is recycled.Meanwhile Nadia Swarowski will discuss how the -year-old crystal brand has made progress is changing its manufacturing systems. Sometimes seen as an ethical alternative to diamonds, the chemical process through which they are made involves dozens of raw materials ndash but the company now publishes a two-yearly sustainability report detailing its efforts to reduce its impact.At home, a lack of knowledge of the textile industry and decades of underinvestment in training means a lot of young people donrsquot consider the range of careers it offers, Ms Farrell adds.Dumfries House teaches  young people a year about the industry and gives them basic sewing skills. Those who are more interested can learn about knitting, hand embroidery and weaving machines on an SQA accredited scheme. There is a high end market for hand-knitted garments, but despite ldquoeverybodyrsquos gran and auntie knitting, the industry finds it hard to recruit people with the skills.Another initiative takes people who have left university and trains them to make luxury fashion products.Mr Lipinski says: ldquoSustainability has become a huge aspect for both manufacturers and consumers over the last couple of years, in Germany at least. Customers are asking not just where do garments, or fabrics come from but also looking for a wider perspective on a brand.ldquoThis started in the food industry. Where did your food come from  How much meat should you eat  Should you eat less but better meat.The fashion industry is some years behind the food industry but is facing some very similar questions, he adds: ldquoGerman consumers are asking where does it come from, but not just that but would I rather purchase something that is lsquofast fashionrsquo or something higher quality. And do I really need it ldquoEven fast fashion companies I know are moving in that direction as well.  hope people will go away inspired.The event is particularly valuable in putting manufacturers and brands in contact with the next generation, he says.ldquoIn Germany, as you do, we see young people demonstrating at rallies about climate change.

At a time of a climate emergency, this is an unmissable opportunity to cut tens of thousands of tonnes of carbon.”Glass bottles are a big part of Mark Hazell’s beer business.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"A record  nominations were received for this years Best Park competition, of which  were in Scotland.\"  Aden Park is Much Loved by public viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"FRAS | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"FRAS | Article Teaser\"The founder of Jaw Brewwants to see as much glass recycled as possible and believes the p deposit on glass bottles will help make that happen.“Jaw Brew has always put the environment at the core of what we do so anything that helps make our materials more sustainable is a definite plus for us,” he said. “I lived in Germany for many years so saw how successful depositschemes can be and it’s great that Scotland is set to introduce its own scheme.”"},{"url":null,"title":"20 of the most unusual baby names chosen in 2018","story":"These are some of the most unusual baby names parents in England and Wales named their children in , according to the Office for National Statistics data..

The society now also delivers animal welfare educational programmes, reaching more than , children in .So it’s fair to say that it has come a long way in the last  years.But for all the successes, there are also new issues it has to face – not least thanks to the advent of the internet.Mike explained: “For years, we have looked after all of Scotland’s animals – wild, farm and domestic.“Farming has come on leaps and bounds in the last few decades and we now have very few problems in the industry.“When I was a kid growing up, you used to have pet shops selling cats, dogs, budgies and the like.“Now, thanks to the internet, people have far more exotic animals in their care which all of our inspectors need to know how to care for and handle – from bearded dragons to massive boa constrictors!“We also have to contend with puppy farmers plying their trade online and selling puppies from car boots.“Some of the puppies die within a few days of people buying them, having paid a lot of money for the animal and thousands on vet fees.“Sadly, we also still see things that I saw  years ago such as Dobermans with every rib on their body sticking out.“However, thanks to our education programme, we are reaching the children of today who will be the animal lovers of the future.“And the majority of people our inspectors visit are not harming animals for fun – it’s a case of ignorance and neglect. In those cases, we’re not just helping the animals, but humans too.“Only five to ten per cent of cases every year are intentional cruelty. So Scotland is still a nation which, in the main, loves and cares for its animals.”That care and concern shines through as the public helps fund the SSPCA’s £ million budget annually.That covers the cost of  employees, including  inspectors,  ambulance drivers and the -strong team based at its nine centres across Scotland and its widle sanctuary.The society receives no government funding and relies solely on the public to fund its work.Mike added: “We are really lucky that, from a population of five and a half million, only  people were prosecuted last year for animal cruelty.“We will never be out of a job but the vast majority of people in Scotland are law abiding and animal loving.“And we couldn’t do what we do without their support.”In December, the Society plans to launch celebrations to commemorate the th anniversary that will run throughout .Anyone with interesting anecdotes or memorabilia they’d like to share should get in touch via its website or by emailing .years@scottishspca.org.The SSPCA is the only animal charity in the UK able to report animal cruelty cases to the Crown, with reports sent to the Procurator Fiscal Service. The charity receives no government funding and relies on donations and grants to continue its work, which costs £ million each year.In , it found homes for  rescued animals, helped more than  wildle casualties and spoke to more than , children.For every pound it receives, p is spent on animal welfare, p on fundraising and promotion and p on administration.So you can rest assured that the bulk of any donation you make will make a huge dference to the animals in the SSPCA’s care.Last year, its animal helpline received almost a quarter of a million calls, the inspectorate attended more than , incidents and more than , animals were cared for across its nine rescue and rehoming centres and at the national wildle rescue centre.

He accepts, reluctantly, the only way to resolve Brexit is to give the British people the general election that Labour, the SNP and the Liberal Democrats have been demanding – but the opposition parties vote against it, arguing that the timing does not suit them.They want a general election, but only once a further extension of EU membership – costing £ billion a month for a minimum of three months – has been agreed with the EU. They accuse Johnson of procuring a coup –yet it is his opponents who have been conspiring and collaborating with the very foreign power he is seeking to disentangle from – taking its legal advice and arranging an extension behind the nation’s back.: Sajid Javid refuses to rule out Brexit Party pactImagine past British politicians collaborating with IRA leaders while there was terrorism on our streets, or having private talks to support Khrushchev during the Cuban missile crisis, or Halax cooking up a deal with Ribbentrop after Poland had been invaded and our troops driven out of France  Yet that is indeed what MPs disrespecting the referendum result have effectively done. Surely these people must face the judgment of the British people through an early general election  Meanwhile Labour leaflets printed and posted before the week’s developments popped through voters’ letterboxes at the weekend demanding a general election “now” – exposing their two-faced opportunism. Labour and opposition parties fear an immediate general election because polling shows strong support for Conservatives before Halloween falls signicantlyit comes afterwards. Further, another poll has shown there is more support for – or put another way, less fear of – leaving the EU “without a deal” than for Corbyn becoming prime minister.After months,not years, of cataclysmic fearmongering of biblical proportions, the British public think Corbyn running the country is far worse than becoming a normal free-trading nation without any special deal between the EU and UK.And yet there is a possibility that Corbyn as prime minister is what we shall get – but without that general election. Not only do Johnson’s opponents want to overturn the referendum result, they wish to overturn the Government without any of us ordinary mortals having a say in the matter – prolonging the longest parliamentary session in  years. This begs the question: why might Corbyn be judged worse If we are to believe the opponents of “no-deal” then overnight we shall be enduring food shortages in shops, run out of fresh sandwiches, endure chaos at ports, be forced to ration medicines, lose valuable export markets and suffer an economic recession. Other, almost-daily scares add to these woes, causing a mood of uncertainty and apprehension yet Britain’s collective upper lip is stfening.We have been here before. We were toldwe voted to leave there would be an immediate recession, some , people would lose their jobs, property prices would collapse and interest rates would have to go up to control rampant inflation. Three years later and none of the “immediate” outcomes has materialised – in fact employment has grown by ,jobs, earnings are outstripping living costs, average property values continue to rise, tax receipts are growing so the deficit is reducing and public finances improving – and while an overdue recession is possible it will be global factors that precipitate it.Whether or not people just don’t believe the scares any more, think any short-term upheaval will be worth our country taking back control or huge compensating economic opportunities are not being reported, it is impossible to say. It might be a combination of all these.It might also be people think Corbyn is simply not fit to be in office. After all, there are many in the Labour Party– or who voted Remain – who think Corbyn would be a disaster. It is not inconceivable a large share of these people consider a five-year Corbyn premiership worse than a no-deal Brexit where any dficulties should prove short-term. Economic forecasts by the independent National Institute of Economic and Social Research and others suggest UK GDP will continue to rise after Brexit but might be - per cent smaller by  thanwe remain in the EU. That’s only . per cent smaller a year – less than GDP averaging  per cent growth over the last  years. All of this has to compare with the possible rule of a prime minister who has sided with practically every enemy of the country, calling many of them his “friends”. A leader whose relationship with anti-semitism in his party has caused many of his MPs and members to leave. A leader advocating economic policies that would cause capital flight and a collapse in investment.Voters know there has never been a Labour government that ended with lower unemployment than it inherited – and at a time of low employment this must mean people will start to lose their jobs. Sure, they probably welcome Labour spending to “end austerity” – but the Conservatives have already started that without Labour’s additional tax rises which the Financial Times estimates at £bn.They can also smell the rancid stench coming from a backroom deal being cooked up with Nicola Sturgeon to provide a second independence referendum infor ensuring there is no early election – and, when later there is, Labour gains power through a confidence-and-supply arrangement. Corbyn would then cling on like a limpet, lasting far longer than any no-deal upheaval.Internationally he could then demonise the only liberal state in the Middle East while siding with misogynist, homophobic Iran and championing the cause of anti-semitic Marxists delivering death and torture in South America, such as Venezuela’s President Nicolas Maduro.The public are not stupid – the real threat to our way of le, our economy and our liberties comes from Corbyn – and there’s no disguising it. Brexit must be delivered and Corbyn stopped. With the help of Brexit Party support reaching out to Labour Leave voters or those who never voted before, Johnson can defeat Corbyn and turn no-deal threats into opportunities.I have some useful numbers when he decides to make the call.Brian Monteith MEP is chief whip of the Brexit Party in the European Parliament©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"euan mccolm winning the only aim of brexit loser boris","story":"Brexiteers may claim they value sovereignty but events of the past week confirm that all they really care about is victory, writes Euan McColmIt’s no longer about Brexit. I wonderit ever really was.The departure of the United Kingdom from the European Union – the seemingly interminable problem that’s felled two prime ministers and exposed a third as a fool – may be at the heart of the crisis that engulfs our politics, but the prize means nothing when compared with the triumph. Winning, at any cost, is everything.Boris Johnson may have led the Leave campaign in  promising that Brexit would be a cinch, that the EU would wave off the UK after meeting any and all of our demands, but now, having achieved his prime objective of becoming Prime Minister, he is bogged down in the swamp of his lies. He and his lieutenants are now desperate.The past week has, from one perspective, been glorious. Those who have long believed Johnson to be a selfish charlatan, a man for whom the achievement of high office has always and only ever been about the satisfaction of his ego, would have found it dficult not to enjoy the sight of reality smacking him in the chops.To watch the Prime Minister lose vote after vote – on Brexit and the matter of a general election – was quite the spectacle.But any pleasure to be taken from Johnson’s misfortune is tempered by the absolute misery of the situation into which he has dragged the UK.Back in , then Tory prime minister, John Major, described Eurosceptics in his cabinet as bastards. His bastards had nothing on Johnson’s.Take Leader of the House, Jacob Rees-Mogg – a dangerous reactionary masquerading as a gentleman – for example. Rees-Mogghas long been one of those who sings from the Brexit hymnbook, where departure from the EU is all sunlit uplands. Last week, he found himself confronted, during a radio broadcast, by Dr David Nicholl about the risk to drug supplies posed by a no-deal Brexit. Inconveniently for Rees-Mogg , Dr Nicholl had been invited to contribute to the government’s contingency plans for No Deal and had raised concerns. On air, the neurologist asked the Commons leader what level of mortality rate he might be willing to accept in the light of a no-deal Brexit. Rees-Mogg rounded on Dr Nicholl, accusing him of “the worst excess of Project Fear”.When Dr Nicholl reminded Rees-Mogg that he had written the plans in mitigation contained in the government’s “Operation Yellowhammer” document, which predicts the consequences of leaving the EU without a deal, the cabinet minister sneered “well, you didn’t write very good plansyou hadn’t worked out how to mitigate”.This attack on an expert for failing to make facts tally with Rees-Mogg’s twisted reality would have been bad enough, but worse was to come when the Leader of the Commons used parliamentary privilege to compare Dr Nicholl to Andrew Wakefield, the disgraced former doctor struck off for his bogus claims that the MMR vaccine was linked to autism.Rees-Mogg, a coward, blithely abused the protection of the House of Commons in order to make an accusation that would have seen him suedhe’d repeated it outside. He later issued an apology.But Rees-Mogg is just a lickspittle, a supporting act in the Carnival of Crap which passes for our government. Boris Johnson is the huckster-in-chief.And what a performance he has delivered.Johnson stood for the Conservative leadership promising to uny the country and his party.On Tuesday, he withdrew the Tory whip from  MPs who voted with opposition parties to take control of Commons business in order to prevent a no-deal Brexit. This was unying in the same way that Rees-Mogg is honourable. After he ended the careersof the likes of former chancellors Ken Clarke and Philip Hammond, Winston Churchill’s grandson Nick Soames, and recent challenger for the Conservative leadership, Rory Stewart, the Prime Minister announced it was his plan to call a general election.Preferring to watch him flop about in the cesspit of his own creation, opposition parties refused to permit this.A day after the opposition united to kibosh Johnson’s election plans, the PM was hit by the resignation as a minister and an MP of his own brother, Jo, who said he could not reconcile family loyalty and the national interest. Andthat wasn’t grim enough, Johnson then attended a police academy in West Yorkshire where he made a wildly inappropriate – and barely coherent – campaign speech in front of number of cadets, one of whom fainted. The local chief constable later complained about the way his officers had been used by the PM.Johnson, we must never forget, is not a Brexiteer through conviction but because he judged that playing a leading role in the Leave campaign would maximise the possibility that he could become Prime Minister. Having signed this Faustian pact, he is now living with the consequences.So for the Prime Minister, the battle of Brexit isn’t about the pros and cons of EU membership, it isn’t about what’s best for the UK and its people, it’s about winning.This, too, is what motivates Rees-Mogg, Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage, and the scores of Little Englander politicians who pollute our discourse with their attacks on experts and their war metaphors. They must achieve Brexit – even of the most painful no-deal iety – at any cost because to fail would be to lose a culture war. Brexit must not be won so much as those opposed to it must be defeated.Euroscepticism is a flag around which those opposed to liberal values of openness and tolerance may rally. They might as well be campaigning to ban cats for all the value of the prize they seek.Brexiteers may claim they value sovereignty, they may claim they wish to “take back control” but, surely, events of the past week confirm that all they really care about is victory.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"lesley riddoch why won t the bbc report on independence marches across scotland","story":"What will it take for the BBC to report on Indy marches going on across Scotland, asks Lesley RiddochNo coverage – again. Fteen thousand independence supporters marched through Perth on Saturday, led by the deputy First Minister John Swinney, and local SNP MP Pete Wishart. I’ve lived near Perth for  years, and can’t remember a bigger gathering on the streets of the slightly douce Fair City. But the chances are that none bar the marchers and those affected by road closures will have any idea a march took place. Ditto the other All Under One Bannermarches held this summer in Oban, Ayr, Aberdeen, Dunfermline and Glasgow - or the Outer Hebrides for Independence march held in Stornoway.Despite the near certainty that more than  thousand folk will turn out for the final scheduled march in Edinburgh next month, and even though it’s a perfectly-timed gt for news producers seeking visual ways to represent the Brexit-induced sht in Scottish public opinion - the same news blackout will probably occur. Yet a small Glasgow march did get front page treatment this weekend - likewise a smaller Brexit demonstration in London. Mind you, they both had something the AUOB march did not - violence, confrontation and arrests. Let’s not be naive. Punch-ups and sectarianism on the streets of Glasgow certainly sells papers. But what does that tell peaceful independence marchers - exercise your democratic rights peacefully and you’ll be completely ignored : SNP electoral gains would lend ‘weight’ for indyref demandsIt’s a moral dilemma that may not unduly bother editors and owners since newspapers are expected to be partisan. But BBC Scotland is a public broadcaster, fundedby licence fee payers, so there’s particular annoyance amongst marchers over its profoundly deaf ear. What’s the problem - wrong democratic leaves on the line One frustrated Yesser observed on twitter “It’s almost like a point of principle for [BBC Scotland] now. If the whole population of Scotland marched at the same time on the same day in every town  city in the country, they would still not report it.Another observed: “No violence, no thuggery, no mess, just happy, hopeful people looking to the future. [We] need to stop expecting the BBC to care.”Aunty is stoking the alienation of independence-supporters from public service broadcasting and has only itself to blamethey switch off, or switch over - and recent statistics suggest thousands of viewers have been doing both. But denying air-time to the peaceful Yes movement could have more serious consequences. People who aren’t heard, tend to shout louder. People who are effectively punished for following rules, often feel tempted to break them. The fact AUOB marches remain ignored, yet completely peaceful, is testimony to excellent stewarding and an in-built Jimmy-Reid-like understanding about the need for discipline. Over time though, faith in democracy, and civic institutions is bound to be erodedthe peaceful exercise of democratic rights is consistently regarded as too boring or small beer to warrant attention. To be crystal clear, I’m not suggesting there’s the slightest chance the precious combination of restraint, fun and respectful behaviour developed on these marches will ever be jettisoned. But activists representing the will of half the voting population cannot go on being ignored by the great and good, without denting Scotland’s conceit of itself as a properly responsive democracy. So, what’s un-newsworthy about the AUOB marches  Is that old problem of balance partly to blame  Has Aunty decided it can’t cover Yes demonstrations, till tens of thousands of “No Thanks” campaigners hire buses to cross Scotland on their only real day offto demonstrate their enduring belief in the strength of the Union  Cos, that will probably never happen.Defensive nationalism - of the kind typied by Better Together - doesn’t rely on street action for impact. Its strength comes from control of the establishment, the great and good, institutions like banks, newspapers and governments, and therefore pensions and public spending. Aspiring nationalism - of the kind typied by the Yes movement - has little institutional underpinningand relies on song, slogan, culture, social media and street protest to express itself. The Yes and No campaigns are very dferent beasts and there will never be “balance” in their activities.So, what must change for marches to get news coverage  Nicola Sturgeon at the helm, perhaps  If so, what does that say about the status of the self-organising Yes movement - does it really need party-political endorsement to make “real” news  Do fteen or even one hundred thousand people on the streets without a First Minister, really constitute no more than a pointless gathering or a rabble in the mind of news producers  If so, that’s shameful.Demonstrations are the preserve of those without institutional clout and so the streets are essentially a working-class domain. Middle class society usually has other, more discreet ways to influence events - networks, contacts, societies, powerful neighbours and golfing companions. So, it’s not surprising the middle-class professionals who run Scotland find the resort to public demonstrations a bit - vulgar, desperate and last season. And a bit hard to pigeon-hole.Law-abiding, peaceful, working-class marchers don’t fit a pre-prepared stereotype. Violent, angry Old Firm supporters do. Road blocks produced by a couple of hundred Extinction Rebellion protesters also look sufficiently confrontational to be newsworthy. But tens of thousands of folk marching peacefully about independence in towns and cities without any experience of large demonstrations for a century  What is that really  It’s not new, it’s not surprising anymore, it doesn’t pose an immediate threat to the status quo or change anything overnight. And that’s what news has become.Coupled with the pervasive belief that “proper” democracy happens only in buildings like parliaments, and it’s not surprising broadcasters feel uncomfortable about street protest. Fling in the banal dficulty that staffing is low at weekends, TV news bulletins are shorter than usual, and Perth is not Glasgow and you have a neat stack of excuses for not sending a camera along. But what do we get instead  Bulletins littered with the antics, outrages, disruptions, preoccupations and entitled social behaviour of the English upper-class. Home-grown demonstrations may be hard to slot in, but their persistent absence from news bulletins just exacerbates feelings of bias and distances BBC Scotland further from half its viewing public.Fortunately, in October, there’s one final chance to get it right.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"cbbc child star mya lecia naylor did not mean to take her own life","story":"Mya-Lecia Naylor, , died after being found in a marquee at her home in south London in April.Emergency services were called to the address in South Norwood, at around am on Sunday April , to reports of a teenage girl in cardiac arrest.She was pronounced dead at Croydon University Hospital shortly after .am.Miss Naylor was due to sit her GCSEs that summer but her parents had recently had a phone call from the school saying her grades were lower than expected.Her father, Martin Naylor, told South London Coroners Court: \"She had not been her normal self ... she was stressed about her exams.\"She knew she needed to get on with her revision and she had plans scheduled out for her revision.\" -

But this week the #Peatbogs# will be back on home turf to showcase their energetic brand of traditional-inspired electronica as part of this year#s Skye Live Festival.The rare Skye gig will mark the start of another autumn tour for the six-piece group, for whom constant re-invention has proved key to longevity spanning almost three decades.The sound that#ll boom out in the tent high above Portree Harbour this Saturday will be far removed from the group#s roots as a folk band playing in local pubs. But the Peatbogs, like more recent successors such as Niteworks, are a reminder that a grounding in traditional music is no barrier to a letime of instrumental experimentation.Le for the Peatbog Faeries began with a gig in Edinbane Lodge in the spring of . Peter Morrison and bass player Innes Hutton from Braes # the two constants in the line-up # were joined by Davie Tait, Ali Pentland and Alan Edmunds.Pubs and village hall dances became their early staple, but gradually more adventurous elements crept into their set and the audiences lapped it up.Morrison recalled: #We#d bring in a blues or a reggae sound, and we found it was these things that started to go down best with audiences.#We moved to more of a world music sound around about , but we never expected much to come of it. We were just out to play at pubs and parties and have a bit of fun#.Their first tape # the #Great Ceilidh Swindle# # sold well locally and paid for a demo in Edinburgh, which in turn caught the ear of Greentrax Records, the specialist label in Scottish traditional music.With bands like Shooglenty and Martyn Bennett also arriving on the scene it proved a perfect time to be breaking new ground and the Peatbog Faeries# debut album #Mellowsity# would stay in Greentrax#s top ten for the next decade-and-a-half.Morrison remembers: #Because of our size and sound, bands like us and Shooglenty cost a lot more to record than other folk bands at the time. So there was a worry at the start.#But as soon as we signed to Greentrax, we quite quickly got an agent and we got sought-after slots at Glastonbury, Nomad and Celtic Connections.#We didn#t really notice what was happening, in a way # it felt like one day we were playing in the pub, the next day playing in front of thousands.#There weren#t that many precedents for bands like ours. Most folk bands just played in pubs. There were some accordion bands that were full-time or groups like #Silly Wizard#, but for us coming out of Skye we never thought it would turn into a full-time occupation.#We just went with the flow and luckily for us it proved a lot more popular than we thought it would be.#The band#s line-up has changed several times, and in turn, each addition helped explore new sounds # the most dramatic sht coming when Rick Taylor and Nigel Hitchcock arrived on Skye in the s to add a three-piece brass section.Taylor # who passed away earlier this year # was a revered musician who had toured with Elton John, while in recent years the Peatbog#s fiddler Peter Tickell left the group to take to the road with Sting.The current scaled-back line-up has seen Morrison and Hutton joined by Edinburgh-based Tom Salter on guitar keyboard player Graeme Stafford from Ardnamurchan drummer Stu Haikney and Shetlander Ross Couper on fiddle.For Peter Morrison, the global tours, the record deals and the Glastonbury stage all owe their origins to the chance he got to learn the chanter in the long-since closed Vatten Bridge primary school.He explains: #Every year Norman MacLeod # the teacher#s husband # and John Laing used to pipe us all in to the Christmas Party, so that was where I first heard the pipes.#Every pupil got the chance of learning the chanter at school, and I think nine of us started playing. It was either that or an hour of maths.#I think I was the only one who carried on into secondary school, but I got the bug. I didn#t like the competing part, but I enjoyed listening to the pipes and learning to play them.#My pal Donnie MacAskill from Roag also played the accordion, so I learned to play drums along with him and from about the age of  I was always in bands.#Morrison#s early piping tutor was Cameron MacFadyen, and he received additional help from Nicol Campbell # another well-known local piper and character from Dunvegan, whose memory has been honoured across the globe.Morrison added: #When he passed away Nicol left me his kilt, which has since been worn on stages in Japan, Africa and America.#A joiner to trade, who also worked for aperiod as a hotelier in Dunvegan, Peter Morrison has seen attitudes to traditional music change over the years, and with it opportunities flourish.He still lives in Roag with we Johan and grown-up kids Jenny and Calum, and it#s no surprise to hear him promote the virtues of free access to music tuition in local schools.He continues to be #amazed# at some of the local talent learning traditional instruments, some of whom he can be heard playing alongside at regular music sessions laid on in the Edinbane Inn and the Old Inn in Carbost.#It#s changed a lot since when I was a youngster whenyou wanted to learn music the only real opportunity was the pipes,# he recalled.#Things like the fis movement have been really helpful in creating opportunities. There now seems to be a constant stream of really good young musicians coming out of Skye.#When I started you would never have thought of making a career out of it, but now with some of these youngsters, it seems to be the only thing they think about. #A lot of these kids are now at a standard that in previous years only a handful of people in Scotland were achieving.#In Skye you have the likes of Daimh, Niteworks, Bridghe Campbell # the list goes on and on. #At these regular sessions there are some great young local players going along like Anna Scott, Dugald McKiggan, Archie and Isobel Maclean and Malin Lewis.#Morrison continued: #Recently over in LorientI saw a great act. It was a Sikh beatboxer, accompanied by step-dancer Sophie Stevenson along with Catherine Tinney from Portree singing puirt-a-beul.#This was another Skye person on the international stage, singing to an incredible standard, but she was someone I#d never heard sing before. #In the past, going somewhere like Lorient,there was a person from Skye on stage you would know exactly who it was # they would be an established name. Now you can go somewhere like that and get a surprise.#It shows the strength in depth there is now.#Some of that west-coast musical talent will be showcased at Skye Live this weekend among a ied line-up that will also include some of the country#s top nightclub DJs.Morrison urged the local community to rally behind the festival weekend, which this year starts with a Thursday-night concert to the Waterboys.He added: #We played at the very first Skye Live five years ago and are looking forward to getting on stage at the Lump in Portree again.#It#s an iconic setting, but organisers have kept the festival to a level that is comfortable for the place.#A capacity of , people is about a fth of the population of Skye and is manageable. When you start to go into the tens of thousands it brings pressures, and it#s a risk to go too big without the infrastructure to support it.#Whenever anyone organises a festival there will always be people who might want to pick holes in it or knock it in some way.#But people need to remember that these guys are putting on a  for so many types of music.#It#s something people of all ages can go to and hear some of the best music in Scotland in Portree.

On Friday , Mrs Steenson received a call informing her that no bus was available due and mix-up between the EA and the transport provider. Speaking to the Andersonstown News, Mrs Steenson said she had “issue after issue” during the summer months due to their errors.“My experience of it is that the Education Authority has a lot of people off sick, they are understaffed and there is a lot of pressure, and there just isn’t enough transport places available for the kids that need them. There are children being let down, and for us personally, it’s just not doable. We both work, and it’s an hour-and-a-half to get down to Fleming and back up again, so to do that while working and bringing our other child to school is impossible.”She continued: “This week we have been very lucky that my work has been flexible and allowed me to take some times, but that’s not sustainable. I hope that her transport can get organised very very quickly so that she can go to school. We have prepared her for going on the bus or getting in a taxi and she’s wondering why it’s not happening – it’s confusing for her.”She added: “I don’t know what we’re going to do. It’ll be very stressful. There’ll probably be days where she can’t make it in because we can’t get transport. I might have to take more time off or my husband might have to.”Despite complaints from parents, the Education Authority has said there has been no reduction to transport services.A spokesperson for the Education Authority , said: “EA provides transport assistance to over , children every day, including , children with Statement of Special Educational Need.“We remain committed to ensuring that all necessary arrangements are in place ahead of the new school year.“In this case, EA’s transport service provision has been maintained and there has been no reduction to services at either school. Where parents are experiencing any issue with their child’s school transport we would encourage and advise them to call their local school transport office, which can be accessed by calling the EA Transport enquiries line   .”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"tony set to launch new book","story":"FRESH from seeing his autobiographical work Paperboy brought to le on the Lyric Theatre stage, author Tony Macaulay is set to launch his debut novel Belfast Gate.The satirical comedy drama is set at a fictional peace gate in Belfast. Twenty years after the peace process, scores of so-called ‘peace walls’ continue to separate Catholic and Protestant neighbourhoods.We are introduced to the character of Jean Beattie whose grief turns to anger when police refuse to open the peace gate at the end of her street to allow her best friend’s funeral procession through to her church on the other side of the peace wall. Comforted by friends Roberta, Bridget and Patricia from the cross-community pensioners’ club, Jean vows that the gate will be opened.Tony spoke of how he was inspired to put pen to paper following his work with a cross-community women’s group at Forthspring Intercommunity Group, situated on Springfield Road’s peace line, across the road where Tony’s father grew up.Tony will launch Belfast Gate on Monday evening at Fountain Street’s Waterstones store. Speaking ahead of the launch he described his novel as“totally dferent from anything I have written and published before”.“It’s my first book set in the present day and it’s written in the present tense. It’s the voice of a narrator, a fictional story rather than a personal memoir. However, the tone, humour and underlying themes are similar to my previous books.”He continued: “After more than  years of peace, the peace walls continue to ide the good people of Belfast, as they have done for  years. I want people to consider the possibility of a future without walls and, importantly, to laugh them down.”Belfast Gate will be available to purchase from Monday September  priced at £ and is available from all good bookstores and online including Amazon Kindle and audiobook.

As part of his instructions, which he wrote in , £, was each given to Labour MP Dennis Skinner and Private Eye investigative journalist Paul Halloran. Another £, was donated to two English residents.The remainder of his estate, which included assets in Ireland, England, Singapore and New Zealand, was handed to the executors and trustees of his will - Joe Cahill and Dessie Mackin - for Sinn Fein.At the time Mr Cahill and Mr Mackin were the partys national treasurers. Their address is listed as  Parnell Square, which is the partys headquarters in Dublin.It was outlined in Mr Hamptons will that the money was to be used to cover election expenses, to fund Sinn Fein offices and advice centres, and to aid republican prisoners and their families in both Ireland and Britain.Mr Hamptons will stated: \"In the event that the organisation which is now known as Sinn Fein should cease to be in existence or should have split or taken a dferent name at the date of death then I direct that my executors and trustees are to apply my monies to the political party to which Mr Gerry Adams MP then belongs.\"\"Should Mr Adams pre-decease me or not be a member of any political party at the date of my death then I direct that my executors and trustees shall apply my monies to the republican or nationalist political party in the six counties, other than the SDLP, which has the largest number of elected councillors.\"Mr Hamptons donation was made public on Thursday by the Electoral Commission.A Probate Registry of Wales document confirms that when he died on January , , at a nursing home in Pembrokeshire, Mr Hampton left an estate in the UK worth £,,.However, at the time of writing his will in , he was living in a mobile home in Ireland.

The donation to Sinn Fein was paid to the party in instalments of £m and £, in April and May this year.The size of the UK estate and the mention of other global assets means that Sinn Fein may yet be in line for further donations from Mr Hampton.Under HM Revenue  Customs rules, Sinn Fein will not have to pay any inheritance tax on the £.m gt as any political party that has at least two MPs in the House of Commons is not liable to do so.Sinn Fein has seven MPs but because of a Westminster abstentionist policy they do not take their seats in the house.A political party also qualies for exemptionit has one MP and received no less than , votes at the last general election.

Members were told that a key element of this innovation project was the provision of mechanism to support the transfer of skills and expertise to company staff and university students.Personalised MedicineIn relation to the prioritisation of the Future Fund of £m and the further anticipated match funding from NI Government and other partners, the emphasis is on advancing with projects such as the Graduate Medical School as a key catalyst for the much-needed expansion of the Ulster University Magee Campus. The delivery of a Personalised Medicine Centre of Excellenceat Ulster University and Altnagelvin is also a priority for this fund as is the provision of an integrated, Council-wide, multi-skills employment pathways intervention support programme.The report advised that work on these innovation projects as well as the proposed SMART and digital city projects were advancing in close collaboration with local industry and partners and relevant government departments, while the strategic outline cases for major regeneration projects for Derry City and Strabane Town Centre are at an advanced stage of progress.The Personalised Medicine Centre of Excellence intends on harnessing the power of Genomics to predict and diagnose inherited and acquired disease, and to personalise treatments and interventions.The Ulster University representatives said it will expand its partnership with Genomics Ireland and other commercial enterprises to sequence the genomes of % of NI’s population contributing to a research database that can be interrogated to develop personalised medicine solutions with worldwide application and valuable I.P. and how it will also contribute to health improvement locally through a unique ‘community buy-in’ approach.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh"},{"url":"https://img.resized.co/derrynow/eyJkYXRhIjoie1widXJsXCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL3MzLWV1LXdlc3QtMS5hbWF6b25hd3MuY29tXFxcL3N0b3JhZ2UucHVibGlzaGVycGx1cy5pZVxcXC9tZWRpYS5yaXZlcm1lZGlhLmllXFxcL3VwbG9hZHNcXFwvMjAxOVxcXC8wOVxcXC8wOTEyMTkwNlxcXC9TVFJBQkFORS1ERVZJQ0UtLnBuZ1wiLFwid2lkdGhcIjo2NDcsXCJoZWlnaHRcIjozNDAsXCJkZWZhdWx0XCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL2NhY2hlLnJlc2l6ZWQuY29cXFwvbm8taW1hZ2UucG5nXCIsXCJvcHRpb25zXCI6W119IiwiaGFzaCI6IjhlOTFmNGZjY2ExNDE2YjZiOGFkN2MwMzExOGY0ZWQ0NThmOWJlMmIifQ==/strabane-device.png","title":"security operation creggan area derry following discovery mortar device strabane","story":"District Commander Superintendent Gordon McCalmont said: \"It is our assessment that the New IRA is responsible for the mortar device that was discovered outside homes in Church View Close in Strabane on Saturday morning th September.

Competing in the competition for the first time, Andrew ploughed excellently over both days, winning a bronze medal on day one.With an aggregate score over the two days of competition used to crown the world champion, it was all to plough for on day two which focused on grassland.And Andrew was in good company with three former world champions making up the top five positions on the first day.He ploughed another fantastic plot to finish in fth place on day two, which placed him fourth overall, picking up the best newcomer award.Andrew said it has always been his dream to compete at the world contest.ldquoIt has been an unbelievable experience and I am so delighted to have won a medal. I am indebted for all the support I have received, particularly from my family, he said.Listooder Ploughing Society chairman Martin Gill spoke of his delight following the gala awards presentation.He said: ldquoTo go to the world contest for the first time, using borrowed equipment and to compete with the best in the world, winning a bronze medal and best newcomer title is a fantastic achievement.ldquoListooder has a long and successful history in ploughing. All three of our members who have competed at the world contest have all come home medal winners.In the reversible class, Hillsboroughrsquos James Coulter, who was also competing at the world contest for the first time, produced another fantastic performance.After finishing th on day one, James ploughed a fantastic plot the day after to win a bronze medal on grassland, finishing fourth overall and winning the best newcomer for the class.There will be little time for Andrew and James to celebrate as they prepare to compete in the Northern Ireland Championships at Cookstown this weekend..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/4th September 2019 Aughlisnafin.jpg","title":"Aughlisnafin primary school opens new sensory garden  ","story":"CHILDREN, teachers and parents at St Maryrsquos Primary School, Aughlisnafin, celebrated the completion of a sensory garden and outdoor learning centre at the school with a barbecue and family fun night last Friday.The garden was officially opened by the school principal, Paddy Hardy, and Laura Brennan, chairperson of the schoolrsquos parent-teacher association.The Northern Ireland Fire and Rescue Service and the RNLI were in attendance to advise the children on fire and water safety.Another special guest was Down gaelic footballer Rory Burns, who took on the children in a lsquoBeat the Goaliersquo competition.The school staff got involved by raising funds with a lsquoSponge the Teacherrsquo event which was a highlight for the children.A total of pound, was raised from all the activities and the barbecue.The school wishes to Fresh Food Centre, Castlewellan, Finnegans Butchers, Castlewellan, and Eurospar, Clough, for their donations.The school also wishes to thank everyone who attended the event for their support..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/4th September 2019 Ban.jpg","title":"Ban on circuses with live animals  ","story":"CIRCUSES using live animals will be banned from performing throughout the Newry, Mourne and Down Council area.The move calling for the council not to grant entertainment licences to circuses using live animals was passed at Monday nightrsquos full council meeting.It echoes back to a previous ban enforced by the legacy Down District Council which prohibited circuses with live animals performing on council facilities.The notice of motion, tabled by Alliance councillor Patrick Brown, was supported by  councillors. The only dissenting voice came from the DUPrsquos Harry Harvey, who voted against.The DUP councillor took an alternative view on the perceived harmful effect that circus le has on animals.Cllr Harvey said: ldquoI wonrsquot be supporting this motion as circus animals are very well trained and well trained animals are generally happy and well looked after.Cllr Brown told the meeting that many animals travelling with circuses were ldquosubjected to constantly being moved around cramped temporary housing, forced training and performance, loud noises and intimidating crowds of people.He continued: ldquoTravelling circus le is likely to have a harmful effect on animal welfare as captive animals are unable to socialise, get enough exercise or exhibit natural behaviours. Many animals develop behavioural and or health problems as a direct result of the captive le that they are forced to lead.He said that a recent report commissioned by the Welsh Government concluded that: ldquoLe for wild animals in travelling circuses... does not appear to constitute either a lsquogood lersquo or a lsquole worth livingrsquo.ldquoThe Irish government recently saw footage from the Animal Defenders International group which showed elephants and camels being repeatedly punched and hit with sticks to perform, said Cllr Brown.He added: ldquoIn May, the UK Government announced it would be banning wild animals in circuses from early . The Irish Government banned wild animals in January .ldquoAs usual, this being a devolved issue, Northern Ireland is behind the times yet again. This issue was actually raised in the Assembly as far back as  by my good friend Jim Wells MLA, who was very critical of the failure of Michelle OrsquoNeillrsquos Agriculture department to include such provisions in the Welfare of Animals Act .The councillor argued that some of the worldrsquos best circuses, such as the Cirque de Soleil, ddid not use any animals which ldquoreflects a global trend towards human-centered performances that no longer use animals, including the Russian and Chinese state circuses.He added: ldquoHopefully council will lead the way on animal welfare and pass this motion.The motion was seconded by fellow Alliance councillor Gregory Bain.Downpatrick SDLP councillor John Trainer, who also supported the motion said circuses did not provide a natural habitat for animals.DUP councillor Billy Walker, UUP councillor David Taylor and Sinn Feacuteinrsquos Willie Clarke all supported the motion on behalf of their respective parties..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/4th September 2019 Community.jpg","title":"Community bid to halt church’s sale of Crossgar centre  ","story":"CHURCH officials in Crossgar are being asked to abort plans to sell a building and consider donating it to local people instead.The community centre in Downpatrick Street mdash which was a former pub mdash was purchased two decades ago but is now on the market for sale as a commercial unit.Representatives of the Church of the Immaculate Conception and St Joseph are planning to meet with community representatives to explain the reasons for the sale which are understood to centre around increased running costs and reduced numbers of people using the facility.Community officials have expressed an interest in working with Newry, Mourne and Down Council to take over the running of the building,agreement could be reached to donate it to the people of Crossgar.They believe that the building offers major potential and could be developed to provide a range of services to meet the needs of a wide range of cross-community groups in the village.Community representatives want the meeting with church officials to be open to localpeople, arguing that a lot of public money has already been invested in the property over recent years which is used by the Crossgar Youth League among others.ldquoThe building could be transformed into a modern community centre with the right investment and commitment. There is a parking area at the rear with spaces for around  vehicles andthese are lost what happens, especially during the summer months when the villagersquos popular Youth League is in full flow, said one community official.ldquoLocal people have been using the property for around  years and we would very much like church officials to consider donating it to them so they can take it over and work with others to manage the running costs.Community officials say there was a need for a dedicated indoor community facility in Crossgar which would meet the needs of many groups and organisations.The added ldquoplans for a major new sports complex unveiled a number of years never came to fruition and were unlikely to in the future.Officials believe thatthe Downpatrick Street building was donated to the people of the village, its future as a community base could potentially be guaranteed.Community officials insist that one of their key priorities is looking after Crossgar Youth League which continues to go from strength to strength and also uses the car park at the rear of the building to store equipment.ldquoIt is no onersquos fault that the Downpatrick Street building is being sold. If there are concerns around its running costs why doesnrsquot the parish come and talk to us and give us the opportunity to work alongside others and take it over  suggested one community official.ldquoThere was a major push to open this building many years ago and a lot of public money was invested in it. The property is critical to the success of the Crossgar Youth League and is an enormous community benefit. It is the best thing we have in the village.ldquoThe loss of the building would have an enormous impact on the Youth League and indeed the Crossgar community. There is potential to do so much with the property and we hope it is not lost to the people of the village.

Existing paths will also be upgraded.Rowallane councillor Billy Walker mdash who has been lobbying for the existing pedestrian crossing to be upgraded mdash is delighted that it is finally going to happen.ldquoThe scheme has been included in the Department for Infrastructurersquos programme and will be installed as pat of the forthcoming environmental improvement scheme, he explained.ldquoI am delighted that after years of lobbying, this much-needed scheme is finally now in the programme and will be delivered. I hope that it will be delivered as soon as possible, given the huge volume of traffic which passes through the centre of the town each day.Cllr Walker said a number of traffic surveys have been carried out over the years to determine the need for an upgraded crossing and is pleased that one is finally going to be delivered and will be paid for by the Department for Infrastructure.ldquoThe importance of this puffin crossing cannot be highlighted enough, he continued. ldquoThe new crossing will see the provision of Killyleaghrsquos first set of traffic lights which in itself is signicant. The traffic lights will ensure drivers come to a complete halt while people are crossing.Cllr Walker said a number of people using the existing pedestrian crossing were hit by cars, while there were ldquocountless near misses.ldquoWhen people press the button on the new puffin crossing, traffic will stop immediately to allow them to cross safely. My thanks go to roads officials for finally agreeing that an upgraded crossing is necessary, he continued.ldquoThe biggest concern many in Killyleagh have is the speed of vehicles approaching Catherine Street from the Comber direction. The new puffin crossing will address this issue at what is a particularly busy main street which is notoriously dficult to cross, even with the presence of the current crossing.Cllr Walker said people need to be able to bring traffic to a halt so they can cross in safety. He is also delighted with the planned environmental improvement scheme and has no doubt it will have a positive impact on the town centre.He added: ldquoA number of similar schemes carried out in other towns and villages across the district have had a signicant impact, helping restore pride and encouraging businesses and residents to spruce up their respective premises.A Newry, Mourne and Down Council spokesman confirmed the council was developing proposals to bring forward seven environmental improvement schemes across the district, one of which is proposed for Killyleagh.ldquoIt is anticipated that this will include upgrade works to pathways, street lighting and street furniture, he explained.ldquoImplementation of the works is however subject to planning approval and the council being successful in an application for funding to the Rural Development Programme.

But he conceded that theof -hour AE services may be dficult.Mr McGoran was invited to address the Down Community Health Committee and said it was important that the South Eastern Trust was having a conversation with campaigners who are keen to continue discussions with officials to ensure the retention of existing services and the delivery of enhanced provision moving forward.Over previous years, relations between both organisations was particularly fraught at times and while they did not always see eye to eye, Mr McGoran hopes they can now move forward together.He said he had ldquonothing but respect for the Down community because local people cared about their health and social care services, committing time and energy to make sure the area gets the best provision it can.ldquoThis is not always obvious everywhere in Northern Ireland, Mr McGoran continued. ldquoYou have been at this for a long time and I have no doubt that without your campaigning work we would not have some of the things we have in this organisation today. I am also not sure that we would have the Downe Hospital.ldquoYour contribution and those who went before you has been fundamental in keeping this area in the spotlight, fighting ultimately for your services. I take my hat off to you. The Downe is here to stay and we have a fantastic facility and there are no staff better. In fact, we have incredible staff who work right across the organisation.Mr McGoran said that while administrators and campaigners may not have always agreed in the past about how the health trust did things, he suggested they all had the same aim mdashwanting the best health and social care that could be delivered, sometimes within challenging resources.Looking to the future, the health chief referred to an ongoing review of emergency care which has resulted in the group overseeing the exercise visiting the Downe and meeting with senior health officials.ldquoI do envisage that there is going to be further change for emergency medicine but when I was asked the question what did I think about the future of the service at the Downe, Ulster and Lagan Valley hospitals in  yearsrsquo time, I could not really answer that, explained Mr McGoran.ldquoI was prepared to say what it would be like in five yearsrsquo time, but could not look beyond that. A five year vision is really something that you can get a hold of and we made it clear to those in charge of the review that the emergency care model we have in place at the Downe will be here in five yearsrsquo time.Mr McGoran said the health trust was on record with the Department of Health during the early stages of the current engagement that it still sees the current model at the Downe comprising the emergency department, out of hours GP service and weekend nurse-led minor injuries unit remaining in place.ldquoWe will still have acute beds in the Downe and it will deal with medically unwell patients. All of the current infrastructure we have will remain in place and our vision is to expect these to remain in place for the next five years, he confirmed.Mr McGoran said the one caveat was that it remained to be seen what the Department of Health will do with the information it has been provided with in relation to the future of emergency care, suggesting serious conversations about the way forward have only just begun.He added: ldquoThere is work ongoing and at some point there may be a consultation exercise. I do not know where all this is going to go and it is a bit early to speculate.Community Health Committee chairman Eamonn McGrady welcomed the health officialrsquos ldquoconstructive and honest engagement with campaigners.He said: ldquoWe need to go forward in a partnership, but that does not mean that we will always agree. Our community supports the Downe Hospital and also the centres of excellence in the bigger hospitals that our delivering our health needs.ldquoBut we need as much care as possible provided as locally as possible, safely and well adequately resourced in a brilliant building.Mr McGrady added: ldquoI hope that in five yearsrsquo time we will be looking at a very major extension at the Downe and a major increase in capacity.

Deirdre, cheering her along the . mile route.The student nurse completed the distance in five hours and  minutes, starting off from her Loughinisland home close to the Teconnaught Road club just after am.She did a km cycle ride yesterday and plans to do  s of the m pool in Bangor today.Eimear has already raised her pound, target to support Daisy Lodge in Newcastle and little Katie Rose McKeown from Armagh in her on-going fight against cancer.However, she hopes that more donations will be made as her challenge continues this week.Speaking on Monday night, Eimear said that she was feeling surprisingly fresh and strong in her legs after completing her first road marathon.ldquoI finished at .am with no one  there only my mum cheering me on, said Eimear. ldquoWe both went off afterwards to Brennanrsquos for breakfast and when we got home I went and had a cold bath and it seemed to really help with my legs.She said that after she reached  miles, she celebrated every next mile as she had never ran beyond  miles before.ldquoI kept telling myself, just one more mile but when I got to  miles, the last three miles felt as hard as the previous  miles but Irsquom just glad that I did

Council because of the murders at Warrenpoint and Mullaghmore was rejected the SDLP and Alliance members.The motion to adjourn was defeated by ten votes to six and immediately the Unionists walked out mdash not in protest but as a gesture of sympathy to those bereaved by the murders.The motion was introduced by Saintfield councillor, Mr William Finlay, who said he looked back with horror at the murders, the victims including  soldiers at Warrenpoint, Lord Mountbatten, his grandson, Nicholas , the Dowager Lady Brabourne, and a  year-old boy, Paul Maxwell.Acting chairman, Mr Paddy OrsquoDonoghuesaid he would be impartial in the matter and was quite sure they all shared the revulsion, horror and disgust and would like to show their sympathy with those were bereaved ldquoin such a dreadful way.He pointed out that there had been two committee meetings of the council since the murders occurred, but since Mr Finlayrsquos motion was a procedural matter councillors must decide without any debate whether or not they wanted to adjourn the meeting.He added: ldquoHowever, whether or not the council decides to adjourn should not be interpreted as to whether or not councillors approve of the vile deeds which have been perpetrated.After the vote, in which the SDLP and Alliance members voted against the Unionists, Mr Finlay said he was sorry about the decision which the majority had made.NEWCASTLE mdash The fireworks display organised as the climax of the Newcastle summer season did not go down with a bang, but instead fizzled out.Torrential rain minutes before the fireworks bonanza was due to begin washed the show out and it now seems likely that the display will be held at Halloween at Downpatrick racecourse instead.Drumgath Accordion Band and Ballykeel Pipe Band were about to march into the arena to put on a marching exhibition when the rain came down.More than pound had been spent on the fireworks, but the rockets, roman candles, catherine wheels, shells, mortars and numerous other favourites were saved from the rain. Disappointed spectators had their money refunded.The fireworks bonanza, sponsored by Down District Council, was to have marked the end of the Percy French Festival.However, the stage will now switch to Downpatrick in October where a successful display was staged last year.ARDGLASS mdash Suki, the cat escaped a horrible death at Ardglass harbour recently, has found a new home in Lisburn.The story about how Suki survived an attempt to have her drowned aroused so much interest that the person who found her, Mrs Joan Owens, was inundated with phone calls to give the cat a home.Mrs Owens, of Ardgtreenan Crescent, Belfast, accepted the first of more than  calls and the cat left for its new home in Dundrod Walk, Lisburn, earlier this week.ldquoSomeone had tried to get rid of the cat, Mrs Owens explained. ldquoSuki was tied in a paper bag and thrown off the side of the harbour, but instead of hitting the waves she landed in our cabin cruiser, which was anchored.ldquoWhen we were taking our boat out of the water for repairs to the hull we came across a torn bag on the deck. Then we heard noises from a cabin mdash and found Suki mothering three new kittens.ldquoUnfortunately, we had to have the three kittens put down and Suki neutered. And then when our two tom cats took a dislike to Suki we were forced to appeal for a home for her.Mrs Owens added: ldquoThe response was overwhelming and the first of many callers took Suki away. My husband, Jim, and I will be ing to our caravan at Ardtole, near Ardglass, this weekend. We hope we donrsquot find any more animals in distress!DOWNPATRICK mdash Downpatrickrsquos new maternity hospital, which is due to replace the Hardy Greer House unit early in the New Year, will not become fully operational until staffing dficulties can be resolved.It is expected that an advertising campaign is to be mounted shortly for all grades of staff required in the bright, new up-to-date hospital.The -bed unit in the grounds of the Downshire Hospital will require up to % more midwery staff than the -bed Hardy Greer House on the Strangford Road, which seems to be permanently under-staffed and struggling along.The new unit will also accommodate an out-patient centre which will mean the transfer of ante-natal and post-natal work which is currently conducted at Downe Hospital.The expected completion date for the new building is November. It is already a couple of months behind schedule because of a host of supply dficulties, the cement strike among them.Once it is handed over it will have to be equipped and sterilised before it can be commissioned. That could take a couple of months.BALLYNAHINCH mdash The September Flower Show organised by the Presbyterian Womenrsquos Association connected to st Ballynahinch Presbyterian Church proved to be a huge success.The Huston Hall was crammed full of baking, handiwork, flowers and vegetables. The judges had a dficult task in deciding who won what.The standard was again very high in the eight sections with encouraging entries in the bread, cake, jam, handiwork, flowers and vegetable classes. After the judging the ious articles were sold at bargain prices, raising almost pound for church funds.KILLYLEAGH mdash Killyleagh artist Leo Casement is making a big name for himself in France. Leo set off for Europe last year after staging a successful one-man exhibition in Downpatrick Library.Now many of his paintings are finding their way into French homes and the name Leo Casement is appearing in French newspapers.Leo had originally indicated that he might be ing home at the end of this month, but he has put his travelling boots on again and is in Amsterdam at the moment.PORTAFERRY mdash Euro MP John Taylor has joined the fight of Portaferry residents, who are angry about the new sewage works scheme which they say will be pumping untreated sewage into Strangford Lough.Mr Taylor is to table a question at this monthrsquos meeting of the European Parliament, askingthe scheme is receiving financial backing from the EEC.Mr Taylor is also demanding to knowthe plant would qualy for help from the EEC regional aid fund,it was modied to include the treatment of sewage.The Euro MP, who was the site engineer in charge of the storm drainage scheme in Portaferry in the late s and who says he has a good knowledge of the problem encountered by residents, intends bluntly askingthe EEC encourages the disposal of raw effluent into the lough.KEARNEY mdash A yacht which was taking part in a race from Bangor to Portpatrick in Scotland struck rocks at Kearney Point on the Ards Peninsula during thick fog at the weekend.Donaghadee Leboat answered the Mayday call and towed the boat and the eight people on board to safety.Yachtsmen competing in the race, organisedby Royal Ulster Yacht Club, said that conditions were probably the worst experienced for the event.The crews found it most dficult with the thick sea mist cutting visibility down to  yards at times as rain lashed down. Only a handful of the  boats finished the course, which started in Bangor via Strangford to Portpatrick.PORTAVOGIE mdash Portavogie fishermen wishing to haul out their boats look like having an easier time in front of them this winter because the NI Fisheries Harbour Authority have ordered a special winch which they hope to have in operation soon.The winch has been ordered from Butters Cranes, Glasgow, and will be able to handle up to  tonnes..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/4th September 2019 Lighthouse.jpg","title":"Lighthouse beam must be preserved  ","story":"THE campaign group lobbying for the retention of the iconic sweeping beam at St Johnrsquos Point Lighthouse near Killough has again insisted that it must be preserved, with the building developed to provide a leading tourist attraction.The Lecale Lightkeepers have written to the Commissioners of Irish Lightsmdash which wants to remove the beam powered by a six ton Fresnel lamp and replace it with an LED light mdash highlighting the importance of retaining the beam in its current form for future generations.Campaigners say that the century-old beam must not be confined to the pages of history, warning CIL thatit persists with its controversial plan, it will miss a ldquotremendous opportunity to preserve both the iconic lighthouse and its beam.The Lecale Lightkeepers say the beam, which is an integral part of the lighthousersquos heritage and a stunning feature of the Lecale landscape, must be retained for people to enjoy.CIL has argued that because the current lamp rotates in a bath of mercury and poses a health and safety risk, it is looking at designing a new mechanism which would allow the mercury to be removed.However, campaigners do not agree, claiming that such an option would be expensive to operate and, most signicantly, alter the character of the light.They have also branded claims that the mercury bath poses a health and safety risk as a ldquored herring and fear that replacing the existing mechanism could potentially damage the lens.In a letter to the Dublin-based CIL, campaigners say they remain as ldquocommitted as ever to preserving the sweeping beam which is important to the local community.In July, CIL confirmed that trials of an alternate bearing system were ongoing but it was unable to make a final determination as to the suitability of such a system.Seeking an update on the trials, campaigners say they have held since the outset that a solid metal-on-solid metal bearing ldquodefies common sense as a practical approach since the energy necessary to overcome the friction forces therein would be costly and the apparatus itself require lubrication and continuous maintenance.ldquoSuch problems were addressed successfully by Messrs Bourdelles  Fresnel, the distinguished French lighthouse engineers in the th century and their designs, including the almost frictionless mercury bearing, were employed in lighthouse construction world-wide, including Ireland and at St Johnrsquos Point in , the letter continues.ldquoWe believe it is an established fact that any potential hazard to health by mercury vapour can be managed by adequate ventilation. This was foreseen in the design of St Johnrsquos Point lighthouse where there is excellent lantern sidewall and cowling ventilation in a tower  feet above the ground in this remote location. There is little hazard from the liquid mercury since it is not readily absorbed dermally.Campaigners have suggested that it would be interesting to see CILrsquos lighthouse keeper health monitoring records for mercury covering the past  years and more when the lighthouse was manned and used the present system. They also said it would be interestingto see the training records for keepers in safe mercury handling during all these years. ldquoPresumably, these would have been managed by independent bodies of experts since the Commissioners probably didnrsquot previously have and donrsquot today have any toxicological experts on your permanent payroll, says the campaigners letter.Another area of concern highlighted is the poor state of the lighthouse, including adjoining housing which a delegation from the Commissionerrsquos office recently visited.Campaigners point to the ldquolamentable state of the walls of the lighthouse station and the grounds, suggesting that they present a picture of ldquowoeful neglect and asking how CIL can expect the public to be impressed with a lack of basic asset maintenance.The letter highlights that the current Fresnel lens system turns  hours a day and is clearly visible from the road outside the lighthouse station.Campaigners say this in itself is a visual attraction during daylight hours ldquosince the magnicent large lens system is big enough to be seen turning on itrsquos mercury bearing and is even more magnicent at night.The letter continues: ldquoWe believe that CIL will miss a tremendous opportunity to preserve this lighthouse and its sweeping beamyou persist with your alternative bearing plans. The whole lighthouse station could become part of a wider tourist attraction in the area. Future generations will thank you for retaining the current historic beam system, still going smoothly after  years and showing no signs of obsolescence. You have not made an economic case for change of lens system at St Johnrsquos Point as far as we know and it is dficult to see how you can.ldquoWhat happens at the lighthouse remains the focus of keen and widespread local and political interest in this area and we will ensure this continues to be a high-profile local issue.The letter adds: ldquoLecale Lightkeepers are willing to fully support CIL and others in any preservation programme that involves retaining the sweeping beam. However, we reject the idea that the use of mercury in this lens bearing application represents a health hazard that cannot be managed by a sensible, low-cost maintenance programme involving chiefly adequate ventilation.

Indeed, it is the official flag of the Northern Ireland international football team. This looks like an overreaction that could be remedied through education to avoid future embarrassment.”Mr Achillea called the News Letter on Monday afternoon to say that the club had been flooded with complaints and went on to make an unreserved apology for his in “inappropriate” comments which had been made “borne out total ignorance”.Mr Achillea conceded that the complaints originally lodged with him had come from Irish fans of Haringley Borough FC.“After an incident at last Saturday’s FA Cup match whereby some Haringey Borough supporters were offended by a flag displayed by the opposition team, as Chairman of Haringey Borough FC I posted a statement which I nowunderstand has offended many people,” he said. “That statement was not designed in any way to offend anyone and was only designed to make the point that as a erse Community based Club we welcome everyone to our ground of all race, religion, creed and disability and thatin future anyone attended our ground and sought to display any material that offended anyone then they would not be allowed to do so. “That was the only intent in my statement. I apologise unreservedly to anyone who was offended by my remarks as a consequence of the inappropriate language that I used in that statement. I did not in any way intend to offend anyone and I accept that my remarks have caused offence and inadvertently inflamed the situation. I have to confess that my remarks were borne out of total ignorance and for that I apologise once again and I fully appreciate that I should have researched matters further before commenting.”Commentators on the club website had debated the legitimacy of the flag, some of them saying that technically, it has not had official status since the early s.However others pointed out that it is used on a day-to-day basis by the Northern Ireland football team and in many other roles. try catch  TrendingLucky Northern Ireland man to treat family after EuroMillions winNI man killed

Image: BBC SpotlightAlthough it has long been known that Mr McGuinness was an IRA commander, he refused to discuss his actions in the organisation and insisted that he had never killed anyone.The images will be broadcast next Tuesday in the first part of one of BBC Northern Ireland’s most ambitious projects, a two-year re-examination of the Troubles which will run over seven programmes. .ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button The first programme in the series also includes a former colonel saying that he was shown evidence by the RUC that Ian Paisley, the future First Minister, had supplied the money for explosives which caused one of the first explosions of the Troubles.The rare footage of an IRA car bomb being assembled was filmed in Londonderry in the early years of the Troubles.During the programme, former IRA bomber Shane Paul O’Doherty commentated on the pictures, saying: “There’s a huge charge there. A very dangerous alarm clock timer that could blow them all to hell.”When asked who he recognised, he said: “Well, there’s Martin....Martin McGuinness.” Mr O’Doherty said he was certain that it was the future deputy First Minister, saying “nobody walks like him, with a stoop in his back”.The car containing the bomb could be identied by its number plate. The BBC programme includes footage of the bomb exploding  minutes later in the centre of Mr McGuinness’s home city, Londonderry.The day after the bombing, Northern Ireland Prime Minister Brian Faulkner was brought to London to be told that security powers would be removed from Stormont and taken on by Westminster, leading to the collapse of Stormont.The Spotlight programme also includes footage of Mr McGuinness showing guns to young children and handing them bullets while seated in a car.Commentating on the film pictures, Mr O’Doherty said: “It’s Martin McGuinness. Very young, tall, handling weapons – a rle and a revolver – rolling up to a load of kids who are staring in the windows, craning in the windows and showing them bullets.“It’s horric, really, because here was McGuinness showing eight, nine and -year-olds guns and bullets that were exciting. People had a feeling that you were on television, you know, you were superstars.”Police had evidence Ian Paisley paid for Troubles bombing, says ex-colonel Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"The programme does not explain the background to the footage. However, Spotlight reporter Darragh MacIntyre said that it would be made clear in a future film in the series.He said that it had been shot by an American documentary maker and was never broadcast.Mr McIntyre, the reporter who in  exposed the then DUP MP Iris Robinson’s affair and financial dealings with property developers, said that the  footage “speaks to a time when within Free Derry and where in the north there was a sense that the IRA had it won, that they were the original guerrilla fighters and within a matter of months would see their way to a new united Ireland...so they were quite free - not just Martin McGuinness - when they were filming with this documentary team”.In , Mr McGuinness told the journalist Eamonn Mallie that he was “very proud that I was a part of the IRA in Derry” but declined to say whether he had ever killed anyone.Last month, former IRA member Kieran Conway said that as the IRA’s chief of staff at the time of the attack which killed Lord Mountbatten and others, including two children, Mr McGuinness had to “take responsibility” for what had happened that day.Another former IRA man, Anthony McIntyre, said of that attack: “If they knew about the children, and were quite prepared to go ahead and to sacrice their lives in order to get Mountbatten, then it’s a war crime”.However, Sinn Féin MLA and former IRA man Raymond McCartney denounced such criticism of Mr McGuinness, saying that he was “held in the highest of esteem across Ireland and internationally”.The Foyle MLA said: “It is reprehensible that anyone would make unfounded allegations against a man who is no longer here to defend himself.”Spotlight on The Troubles – a Secret History involve two -minute programmes and five hour-long episodes. The series has been overseen by editor Jeremy Adams, deputy editor Gwyneth Jones and producer Chris Thornton. It involves three senior Spotlight reporters – Darragh MacIntyre, Jenner O’Leary and Mandy McAuley.The first programme will be broadcast on BBC One NI on Tuesday at .pm and will also be shown on BBC Four across the UK at the same time.try catch  TrendingNI man killed in road crash is namedTransfer Deadline Day RECAP: Rangers confirm pound.m Ryan Kent signing from Liverpool, Celtic sign three,

Of those,  have been empty for more than two years.Landlords will be given incentives to bring long term empty properties into use as the council says they attract crime and anti-social behaviour, drive down values and become ldquodetrimental to the lives of residents.Measures are set out in a draft strategy which the councilrsquos cabinet, on July , agreed to publish for public consultation.While the council wants landlords to accept help to get homes in use, the strategy says theauthority will take actionnecessary.Vale council deputy leader Cllr Lis Burnett told the meeting she was ldquostunned more than  homes in the Vale have been empty for more than two years.ldquoItrsquos absolutely staggering, she said. ldquoA strategy on a way we can tackle it is very welcome.

Ms Parker and Mr Glover met several years ago when he trained her at their local gym. They then ended up unexpectedly working together later in le when Mr Glover changed jobs.Mr Glover said: ldquoIt was very tough for Julie before the transplant as she suffered with a genetic lung disease and her lungs slowly stopped working over a few years.\"It got to the point where she required an oxygen tank to be strapped to her back so that she could breathe. She never gave up and still worked and tried to do as much as she could and always kept a smile on her face.Ms Parker has a rare condition called Alpha--antitrypsin deficiency which means she lacks a protective enzyme inhibitor which makes her more vulnerable to smoke, dust and other toxic materials and increases the risk of lung disease. Because of the deficiency, Ms Parker was required to have a double lung transplant. Shortly after the transplant Ms Parker went to lunch with Mr Glover and he was amazed at how well she looked.He said: ldquoBecause I was seeing her every day, I knew her health was declining as a result of the lung disease. But I donrsquot think I was so aware of the extent until I saw her after the operation, and how healthy she looked.This isnrsquot the first challenge Mr Glover has taken on.In the past he has carried lbs up and down the highest mountain in Southern Britain, completed car dead lts and successfully performed  pull ups.The pair now plan to walk Pen-Y-Fan, the highest mountain in South Wales, together to raise money in the future once Ms Parker is well enough.Mr Glover set out to raise pound, and has now raised pound.Officially, Mr Glover had only  days to train for this challenge, enlisting friends to help him by sitting in the car and steering as he tows.ldquoI was getting up at :am to run around car parks towing the car with a harness before work,\" he said. \"I love setting myself challenges but donrsquot tend to do what everyone  does. So I will look for something a bit far out or invent my own and usually try and document them on video.All the proceeds from the day will go towards the charityrsquos Harefield Transplant Appeal, to raise funds for organ care systems to allow more patients to receive le-saving transplants.If yoursquod like to support Mr Glover in his marathon challenge his Justgiving page is: https:www.justgiving fundraising muscleworld article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Two-year-old Matilda Philpott who has Stickler Syndrome was joined by her two brothers, Oliva and Alfie, four-year-old Alice Haswell who has Goldenhar Syndrome camped out with her sister Scarlet, and -year-old Daisy Stacey who has Vacterl Association attended with her sister Molly.The weekend saw the families take part in a range of activities from archery, crafts and pop rockets to laser shooting, fire lighting, bush craft and raft making.The camp was the first time the referred children have been on a Scout Camp, something leaders have been hoping to achieve since the start of the group.Ruth Weltch, Group Scout Leader said: ldquoThe opportunity to regularly set up camp in the great outdoors is one of the main reasons young people enjoy Scouting so much and we wanted to give our children, who would not normally have the opportunity, the chance to take part in a weekend of outdoor activities and to sleep under canvas with their families.ldquoWe have been overwhelmed and humbled by the amount of help offered by leaders, not just from Cardf and Vale Scouts but from other scouting areas in Wales.This reflects the scope of the hospice itself which is open to all children with le limiting illnesses throughout Wales.ldquoWe have been able to give these children the opportunity to take part in activities not usually accessible to them and that we take for granted. It was an absolute joy to see them and their families take part in the weekendrsquos activities, seeing them smile and forget about their worries for a while was heart-warming.Lynne Phelps, from Ty Hafan, said: ldquoThe hard work, time and effort put in by the Scout Group since its inception has been truly amazing. The group has brought so much happiness to the hospice and given the children referred to us an opportunity to take part in activities with their families that they wouldnrsquot have had access toit wasnrsquot for Scouts.ldquoThe group has had a really positive impact not just on the children in our care, but also their families and our staff. We really canrsquot thank the Ty Hafan Scout Group enough.The Ty Hafan Scout Group was set up on the Scouting Centenary in  for any child referred to the hospice along with their siblings, parents and family, to spend time together having fun and making memories.A growing need for sibling involvement was soon recognised and so the group began to run regular sibling camps.The sibling camps have given the young people who have brothers and sisters in the care of the hospice the opportunity to attend events such as Scarefest and the Jurassic International Jamboree, as well as the chance to spend quality family time with their loved ones.ScoutsCymru gives over , young people in Wales the opportunity to enjoy fun and adventure while developing the skills they need to succeed, now and in the future.Open to all young people in Wales regardless of faith, gender, sexual orientation, race or social background, the movement encourages its members to do more, learn more and be more. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We speak to founder Daniel Crawford and his team about the journey so far A spark in the mind of Daniel Crawford as he studied for his masters degree in Glasgow just a few years ago has grown into a business at the sharp end of technology. axialD is tasked with turning the complicated and laborious process of converting D medical scans into D models – and producing them for use by surgeons and medical professionals. It’s an ever-growing business, spun out of Ulster University, which is expanding its reach across the UK, Ireland and now into the US where it’s targeting a burgeoning fresh marketplace. The company has been involved with Catalyst since , been directly involved with a host of its programmes, and is participating in the EU INTERREG funded North West Centre for Advanced Manufacturing , managed by the Special European Union Programmes Body . Catalyst is Northern Ireland’s leading technology hub, home to  companies and around , staff. Daniel has a strong team around him – growing to  staff based in Belfast city centre, including Niall Haslam, chief technology officer, Katie McKinley, head of new business and strategic partnerships and Cathy Coomber as operations manager. While studying medical visualisation and human anatomy in Glasgow, Daniel was exposed to the raft of imaging available – including CT, MRI and ultrasound, and began examining how the crucial data could be better used. The biomedical physics undergraduate grew the idea into his thesis – looking at converting D data sets and converting them into fully D printable files. “That allows us to turn images into D models to allow surgeons or registrars, to understand digital pathologies, before going in to theatre,” he said. “But we discovered it wasn’t just good for that and surgeons also wanted to get their hands on the D models.” That gave Daniel greater scope for developing the concept. In one early case, a surgeon was able to use one of the D prints to identy small fractures in a patient who had suffered a motorcycle crash, that weren’t initially apparent using more traditional methods. The company was thrust into Catalyst’s Springboard programme in  – a  week scheme which allowed a would-be entrepreneur, fresh out of university, access to business training and development, which included working with PathXL’s Stuart Harvey. From there, it was into the Halo programme – bringing axialD together with angel investors in order to get the start-up off the ground. It landed £, through Techstart and private investors, which allowed the company to get the ball rolling. Through Catalyst, Daniel also got the opportunity to visit MIT and the entrepreneurial development programme, Way to Scale, bringing axialD to Massachusetts and the Boston area – the global heart of the health technology sector. Niall Haslam is axialD’s chief technical officer. He said a Belfast and Boston partnership has helped strengthen the links between the cities, bringing firms from Northern Ireland to the US for both networking and scoping out the potential for setting up shop across the Atlantic. “The Way to Scale program brings entrepreneurs together. It’s a great networking opportunity,” Niall says. axialD is now a partner in the EU INTERREG-funded NW CAM, which brings together a network of research institutes, universities and enterprises to carry out research in advanced manufacturing. It is working with Ulster University on a number of projects, including looking at developing custom designed jigs for hospitals to produce D models. Cathy Coomber has been with axialD for three years. “What we have done in that time is looking at standardising the processes,” she says. “Biomedical engineers from Ulster University and those across the UK are producing data, manually segmenting thousands of medical images in order to help them develop an algorithm. “That allows us to massively improve our standardised process and reduce the time involved in producing those files.” That could mean reducing the time down from up to five hours, to as little as an hour. “When the company started, Daniel was able to get those early users excited in Glasgow, and then setting up in Belfast there were key surgeons which helped set the pace,” Katie McKinley, head of new business and strategic partnerships said. The company has since been involved with NHS frameworks as a means to help remove as many bottlenecks as possible. This involves developing and marketing the products to the NHS and HSC in the Republic – helping them to learn about the product, the process and what area of specialism it can be used in. “In the last  months with the development of the algorithms, we are moving in to the US,” Katie said. “We’re seeing a lot of growth in the US.” And the axialD team is also growing fast. “We have  staff at the moment but are looking to expand in  months,” Daniel said. “That includes new staff in the US to help grow and manage that market as we further expand our software team back home.” The success of axialD mirrors the overall success of Catalyst, since its inception  years ago. It’s an independent not-for-profit organisation across its four sites – including its largest base at the Titanic Quarter in Belfast, alongside its Londonderry hub, Ballymena, along with the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub at Danske Bank in Belfast city centre.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/jm_1.jpg","title":"how do you retain staff and keep them enjoying their job","story":"Posted on Wednesday September  by Ulster Business With such intense competition for talent, the challenge for employers isn’t just finding prospective candidates, it’s also keeping them, writes John Moore, managing director of Hays NI Astonishingly, almost half of professionals surveyed in the Hays What Workers Want Report said that they left at least one new job within the first  months because it didn’t match expectations formed during the application process. A signicant number of our employees at Hays have been with us for , ,  and even  years, and we pride ourselves on growing our own talent and promoting from within. Although there are times when employees leave due to circumstances employers can’t control, organisations can create the right conditions to retain their staff for as long as possible. We believe there are three key areas. A sense of purpose Across ages, cultures and sectors, professionals need to get up in the morning knowing that they can make a dference. No matter how big or small, recognising a clear and meaningful purpose in your role is a huge driver for staff. Communication is key for employers. By prioritising employee progression, offering regular feedback and communicating the wider objectives of the business, employers can ensure their staff come to work each day with a strong purpose. Variety each day While not every task can be exciting, and some parts of a job will inevitably be more stimulating than others,the mundane becomes the usual, employees will think about moving on. Injecting iety into each week and staying interested at work partly falls on employees themselves, who can proactively seize opportunities. But a good employer should also push their staff and encourage them to work outside of their comfort zones. This ensures professionals can keep growing and developing within an organisation rather than move where. A strong network The people we work with have a huge bearing on our happiness levels at work. You simply can’t stay in a role long-termyou don’t enjoy working with those around you, so the importance and impact of these relationships are not to be underrated. Employers can help their staff develop a network of inspiring and admirable colleagues from their first day by making sure they receive proper introductions and support contacts. Workers who have these strong bonds feel a greater sense of belonging which keeps them wanting to work in their organisation. With these three points in mind, it’s important to consider how someone’s organisation and role makes them feel, rather than just how impactful their salary or bonus might be. After all, this is what can’t easily be replicated across organisations and can keep an employee with an organisation throughout their career.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"new  bedroom boutique hotel planned for belfast","story":"Posted on Wednesday September  by John Mulgrew A listed Belfast building could become a new hotel and restaurant as part of wider plans for a £m revamp of the city centre. Tribeca Belfast, formerly Royal Exchange, will see UK developer Castlebrooke redevelop much of the north side of the city centre. It’s made a number of amendments and changes to the development, most notably revising back from a formerly retail-led scheme to one with fewer shops. As part of the revised plans it wants to turn the listed former Assembly Rooms building at the corner of North Street and Waring Street into a new -bedroom hotel, with a restaurant and bars. That would involve knocking down part of the newer extension to the building, including the rear part of the former Northern Bank and the adjacent - North Street to “accommodate the new extension to form the proposed boutique hotel”. “The proposals for the existing building are similar in scope to that which was included as part of the extant approval. It is proposed to conservatively repair the existing historic fabric of the former Northern Bank,” a design statement says. “A key feature of the proposed extension is that the interface with the rearelevation of the existing listed bank building will be improved by setting back the footprint of the proposed extension so that the north west corner of the original building is readable.” The scheme includes the re-use and adaptation of the existing building as well as an extension on the footprint of the existing s extension on North Street. The extension will be set over five floors, with a rooftop bar, while upper floors are set back with metal cladding to the facades to “reduce the overall massing of the building and reflect the roofing materials or upper story treatment of surrounding buildings”. Tribeca Belfast includes development around Royal Avenue, Donegall Street, North Street, Garfield Street and High Street. Castlebrooke Investments says it is now committed to bringing North Street Arcade back into use in a new format, with space designed for independent retailers. This summer the developer ran a fresh public consultation amid revised plans for the scheme, which included signicantly reducing a huge -storey building to around , retaining additional facades and dropping plans for an underground car park.

Before starting as a trainee solicitor in a City of London firm, I initially worked as a paralegal for three months in a law firm in Perth, enjoying the lestyle and dferent culture of le in Australia, and then spent a further three months travelling in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. After ing to London, I qualied as a solicitor and then spent eight years working in the real estate department of a London law firm. With two young children, we decided to move back to Northern Ireland in  when I joined Cleaver Fulton Rankin as an assistant solicitor. I have been here ever since and was made a director in . What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  As we will all be aware, the real estate market can be a bit of a rollercoaster. Having been involved in some fantastic deals here in Northern Ireland, largely courtesy of the peace idend, this all came crashing to a halt in . For real estate lawyers in particular, this presented a fresh challenge in terms of expanding client base and ensuring that our teams were kept busy. For a number of years I spent more time advising clients on restructuring, acting for administrators or receivers in selling off assets and working on refinancing transactions. This proved to be a huge contrast to the positive and very visible growth in the economy seen in the previous years. Thankfully, the real estate sector again currently seems to be enjoying good growth with high rates offor investors. However, it has to be said that the lack of political leadership here does still give cause for concern. How would you describe your management style  The most important resource that we have is our young people, so I hopefully lead by example and seek to encourage them. In my view the carrot is always better than the stick. What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I have spent over  years now practising law, butI could go back to university again, rather than doing a law degree, I would have studied history. It would have meant an extra year spent in training, but I think it may have kept my interest slightly more than lectures on tort and equity. Have you done it all on your own  No, absolutely not. One of the main reasons for coming back to Northern Ireland was, with a young family, we had the benefit here of family support. My parents in particular, played a key role in helping with child care at a time when I was trying to establish my career. I never underestimate the dficulties facing working parents with young children who deserve all the credit and support that they can get. A strong support network is also very important in the office and I am lucky to have the benefit of some great lawyers around me to whom I can turn to for help when needed. How would you like your business to be remembered  As a leading commercial law firm in Northern Ireland that is independent and innovative provides high quality legal advice to its clients conducts business in a socially responsible and ethical matter has a strong commercial awareness and specialist legal professionals.

Founder and managing director David Whelan speaks to Ulster Business about a business which boasts the right tools for the job David Whelan’s vision and mantra for what is now one of the leading telecoms businesses is clear – telecommunications services are only as good as the foundations on which they are built, with engineering front and centre. He’s the entrepreneur behind Clarity Telecom – a successful Belfast-based full-service telecommunications solutions company with almost  years under its belt, helping develop top-end connectivity – including lines, calls, mobile, broadband and cloud software – for businesses across Ireland and the UK. And for David, telecoms is all about engineering at the core of finding the best comprehensive solution to its customers, having the right tools for the job, and having world class people. For Clarity Telecom, it’s about developing a bespoke system for companies, focusing on engineering from day one. Since its inception in , Clarity Telecom has grown to have a greater engineering capability than any other independent telecommunications company in Northern Ireland, and is now rolling out its leading byphone VoIPsystem throughout the UK and Ireland. David also says through Clarity Telecom and its burgeoning byphone technology, the company could double revenues in the next three years as well as growing its workforce. “The phone network stops at a plug in the wall and from that point on, you have to provide the infrastructure and management,” David says. “What we do is focus on the engineering. It’s all about how well it works and adapts to your business. “By focusing on that we are looking at the way things are being built, and we can then get insights on how we can change and improve things.” Led by engineering, the Clarity team is driving change within the telecoms industry ensuring client infrastructure is fit for purpose and for the future. That starts with assessing a business’s needs, making sure the network is suitable, reviewing the workforce needs and bandwidth requirements. From there, Clarity Telecom can develop a bespoke solution – from cabling, to switching, cloud services, routing and phone systems. Clarity Telecom now has a team of  staff – a third of whom work directly within the engineering side of the business. But that number could grow further still, as the company expands its business across Northern Ireland, and develops its byphone technology. The company developed its subsidiary, Voxbit, in  – specically to design engineering solutions. And through that has come one of its most successful products, byphone. A simple to use VoIP , byphone is a drag and drop system that allows users to configure their own phone set up suited to the exact needs of the organisation and enables a range of analysis tools that can help business owners drive up efficiencies. “In  as VoIP started coming along, I realised that was a signicant opportunity,” David says. “Where the communications industry is going is into the cloud. It’s going from traditional storage within buildings, into something in the cloud. The traditional telephone systems are evolving. “We started making a series of innovations surrounding cloud technology. We realised you can make it simpler – we were asking ourselves, can you make it work without a manual, for example. “If you can, in the same way as Apple’s iPhone made things easier for users, people will start using the services. It’s about making everyone’s le easier. “The end user wants to be able to use the system easily, from managing their telephone number, to having access to voicemail. It’s about the ‘power of simple’. “We now have around  resellers for the byphone system in the UK, and we are looking at trebling or quadrupling those sales,” he said. One of Clarity Telecom’s customers is Mid  East Antrim Borough Council. The firm was tasked with bringing together the complex communication needs of the new ‘super council’ following the amalgamation in . “With bringing three councils together, one of the main problems was having a single phone number that people could call. If you have numerous sites, spread across three council areas, that would involve a lot of rip and replace,” David says. “But we gave them one telephone number and then managed the routing to all those bits of equipment across the council areas.” Hotel giant Andras House – which operates seven hotels and , rooms in Belfast including the Crowne Plaza at Shaw’s Bridge and the new Hampton Hilton – is also another major customer. “Businesses trust us to be able to provide the engineering solutions in order for them to run their companies,” David says. So, why should a business consider Clarity Telecom for its crucial and comprehensive connectivity needs  David says Clarity is all about improving how companies interact with their customers – making it easier, and thus, improving revenue and sales. “As you manage your telephone connections you become better at dealing with your customers – you become more efficient at dealing with them, and they will have a better experience. It’s about improving customer contact. “As a business you are able to do a lot more, such as listening to call recordings, access to statistics and using data which will help manage that contact, as well as saving on costs and making your business more efficient. “What solution depends on your business. That is where we come along. We never put a system in without doing a full engineering visit.” Some of the connectivity includes the ability to connect landline with mobile phones, call forwarding and being able to access voicemails as digital recordings, by phone or computer. “When companies deal with us, they can come along and say ‘this is what we are trying to do’, and we are able to work the engineering and infrastructure, before then providing the services,” David says. “It’s also about fighting against the view that it’s all about price. Yes, you have to be competitive, but you need the right infrastructure. For example,a shop loses connectivity for two days, then they lose two days of sales, simply because they don’t have the back-up for the credit card payment system. “It’s about getting businesses to think about the infrastructure and all of the issues. It’s not just about how cheap you can make a call. It’s about how customers can engage with your business – and we are at the heart of making that happen.” For further information, contact Clarity Telecom on    or visit www.clarityteleView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
