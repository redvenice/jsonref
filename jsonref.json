[{"url":null,"title":"Coronavirus UK Scientists demand RETHINK June 21 Freedom Day","story":"Share this articleParts of the country with the most cases of the B1617.2 variant in the two weeks up to May 22 were Bolton (1,517 cases), Blackburn with Darwen (497), Bedford (426), Leicester (216), Manchester (178), Birmingham (151), Wigan (150) and Central Bedfordshire (101).The Indian variant makes up the majority of cases in all those areas except Manchester (48 per cent) - nationally it accounts for between half and three quarters.  All the areas except Bolton and Bedford, which were the first places to be Indian variant hotspots, have seen their case numbers rise by between 23 and 94 per cent in the most recent week, between May 19 and May 25.Cases have been increasing in hotspot areas even despite the numbers of tests staying level, official figures suggest, meaning surge testing is likely not behind the rise and there is a genuine increase.Department of Health data show that Blackburn, which has the second highest rate of Indian variant cases, now has the most infections per person of any local authority in the country after a 70 per cent spike in a week.The Lancashire town had 365 cases per 100,000 people in the week up to May 25, when a total of 546 people tested positive. It surpassed former hotspot Bolton, which had a rate of 362 and falling, with 1,041 cases.Meanwhile, world leaders have been told Covid vaccines must be shared with poorer nations to prevent richer countries being hit by newly-imported deadly variants.Global bodies - along with MPs and peers - warned of fresh lockdowns if people in developing nations do not get a huge increase in jabs. In Scotland, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon will confirm \u0027whether and to what extent\u0027 plans to further ease coronavirus restrictions can take place on June 7, amid extra controls in Glasgow to deal with rising cases.With vaccines seen as the main escape route from repeated lockdowns to control the pandemic, governments around the world are being urged to do more to ensure those in developing nations can access jabs.The heads of the World Health Organisation, International Monetary Fund, World Bank Group and World Trade Organisation warned of a \u0027dangerous gap\u0027 in the availability of jabs, with low-income nations receiving \u0027less than 1 per cent of vaccines administered so far\u0027.\u0027Inequitable vaccine distribution is not only leaving untold millions of people vulnerable to the virus. It is also allowing deadly variants to emerge and ricochet back across the world,\u0027 they said in an open letter published in a number of global newspapers, including the Daily Telegraph.In a separate letter, a cross-party group of more than 100 MPs and peers wrote to the Prime Minister with a similar message, calling for Britain to export more jabs to developing countries in a bid to prevent new variants from wrecking Britain\u0027s freedom plans.Urging Boris Johnson to show \u0027global leadership\u0027 in the run-up to the G7 in Cornwall next week, the parliamentarians - including former Archbishop of Canterbury Lord Carey and Tory ex-health minister Dr Dan Poulter - urged him to commit to a one in, one out policy when it comes to vaccines.For every dose bought for use in Britain, the signatories want the UK Government to donate a dose to the United Nations-backed Covax scheme, which is providing vaccines to low and middle-income countries.\u0027The longer we wait to act, the more likely it is that dangerous variants could emerge that can evade the protections offered by current vaccines,\u0027 they told Mr Johnson, in a letter seen by the PA news agency.Meanwhile, schools could stay open half an hour longer each day as part of a £15 billion plan to help pupils catch-up after having their learning disrupted by coronavirus shutdowns, according to the Times."},{"url":null,"title":"Oxfordshire smoke free county England","story":"Share this article While 12 per cent of Oxfordshire\u0027s population currently smoke, people earning lower incomes, those with mental illnesses, the homeless and travellers, all have a higher rate of smoking.Andrew McHugh, a member of the health improvement partnership board, said he had asked Cherwell District Council, where he is a councillor, to make all new pavement licenses smoke-free.Pavement licenses allow restaurants and bars to place tables and chairs outside their premises.The council denied the request, saying that the easing of coronavirus restrictions was not the time to impose more rules on businesses.But Dr Briggs asked members of the board, who sit on different councils around Oxfordshire, to make similar requests in the near future.A pro-smoking campaign group called The Freedom Organisation for the Right to Enjoy Smoking Tobacco (Forest) has criticised the plans.Simon Clark, director of the smokers\u0027 lobby group Forest, said: \u0027It\u0027s no business of local councils if adults choose to smoke, and if they smoke outside during working hours that\u0027s a matter for them and their employer not the council.\u0027Smoke-free is officially recognised by the Government when five per cent of the population or less are smokers. Last year, data from the charity Action on Smoking and Health (ASH), found 2,132 people died from smoking-related causes in Oxfordshire between 2012 and 2017. ASH also said 23 tonnes of waste, or enough to fill 421 wheelie bins, is gathered in the form of cigarette butts in Oxfordshire each year. It was also estimated that smoking related house fires cost the Oxfordshire economy £2.7million. Government initiatives to cut smoking rates have been introduced regularly over the  years in the UK in an effort to reduce smoking.Health warnings on packaging became mandatory in 2002, adverts were banned in 2003 and smoking indoors was banned in 2007.And officials followed up the measures in 2017 with a policy that meant all branded packaging had to be replaced with plain greenish-brown boxes."},{"url":null,"title":"good to see you businesses on welcoming back customers","story":"Even before the Covid-19 pub closures were officially announced, Burnett and his team had made the difficult decision to shut up shop. “We’re best known in Cardiff as a cabaret venue for the LGBT+ scene,” he says. “Even before lockdown, people were starting to get nervous about Covid and were staying away, so I knew we’d have to close.” But after learning that the closures were likely to be long term, Burnett decided that “the show must go on”. “We normally do cabaret four or five nights a week – our customers regularly travel to Cardiff to visit the gay bars because they don’t have those connections locally,” he says. So, led by the pub’s resident drag queen, Baroness Mary Golds, the team decided to try streaming their cabaret show live on Facebook. The first one received such rave reviews that they ran another the following night, this time including a link to a GoFundMe page. “We still had costs even though the pub was standing empty,” says Burnett. “I was expecting we’d raise £1,000 over four or five weeks but we reached £1,000 on that first night, thanks to the way our customers supported us.” Buoyed by the overwhelming response, the team continued to broadcast drag shows four times a week, raising close to £16,000, much of which went to local charities and causes. “We’ve raised almost £7,000 for charities like Homeless Hope, which looks after the feet of the homeless. We’ve also sent ‘love bundles’ to performers, because performing arts – and the performers themselves – have been hit hard by Covid. “Mary was very much a hero, performing four nights a week – and bear in mind these people weren’t getting paid. We really were in this together.” When it came to reopening the pub in April, customers were greeted by major changes, coordinated by bar manager Evan Perkins. “We revamped the bar area, created a bigger outside space and have sanitisers at every entry and exit point, and around the building,” says Burnett. Performers lead customers to the tables outside, while explaining the regulations. For now, the cabaret performances continue to be streamed from an upstairs room while they make arrangements for when live entertainment can resume. “Mary says she’s going to cry the first time she hears a live round of applause – at the moment we have fake applause at the end of each song or joke,” says Burnett. He says the response from regulars has been incredible. “I was due to leave at the end of the year – I’d said after five years I’d move on – but the community has supported us through the worst year in history for hospitality, so how can I leave now? “Yesterday, I walked into the beer garden and it was blowing a gale but was full of people sat there in raincoats, getting soaked. They just raised their glasses and went ‘cheers’. It says a lot about how much they value this place.” “The last year has been incredibly hard but having nearly lost my business during the recession, I knew I could get through difficult times again. I’ve run the salon since 2002 and there’s 10 of us here. The salon means different things to people – for some, it’s just a haircut but for others it’s a community. Some customers come several times a week because they aren’t physically able to do their hair at home, so they really rely on us. “I think this past year has made people realise how important their local salon is – the relationships they’ve built and how that impacts on how they feel. “Being told we were closing was devastating but I took the mindset of ‘this isn’t going to beat me’. I furloughed everybody except my managing director and as I was already a business coach helping other salons, I used the time to write a book sharing advice for salon owners, as well as putting on free business events. “The two of us communicated as much as we could with our team and clients, running Facebook quizzes and sharing pictures on social media of us growing out our roots for example, reminding clients we were still very much with them. “Before reopening, the team went through infection control training and we put in a sanitising station and implemented things like PPE. We also added a doorbell so people can’t just walk in, and put signs on the floor saying where to stand and walk. “It’s been tough, but everybody has adapted brilliantly. Hairdressers are so passionate about what they do, we’ve really missed the creativity of it all.” “One of our most important goals for these first few months, and shows, is making the audience feel as comfortable as we can. “We’ve bought thermal imaging cameras to take everyone’s temperature as they enter the theatre, which can read 30 people per second. If someone’s temperature is too high, we’ll wait a few minutes and check them with a handheld thermometer. “Unfortunately, if they still have a high temperature, we’ll have to refund them their ticket as we have to maintain safety for everybody involved. “Our cafe has been open since we were allowed to reopen for takeaway, and we will start offering socially distanced indoor dining in our cafe on the week of 17 May. The first two shows are on the 18th and 19th, and the audience and staff will still have to wear face coverings. “This will be our 135th anniversary season. It’s been tough, but we still have hope. “There are a lot of rules backstage, too. Things like the green room have changed –we had one for everyone, but now it’s for visiting companies and we have facilities elsewhere for our staff.” “We’ve actually made quite a few changes since lockdown. Something I realised I was missing was the interaction with people. Before Covid, we were predominantly a sourdough bakery with a seating area, where we served lunches very much based on local produce. “When the cafe had to close we decided to reduce the amount of seating, move bread sales in there and expand our range of products. By moving things round we made a larger space for people, and we built a pantry area with lots of ingredients for things that people could recreate at home. We also invested in a large retail fridge to stock Irish cheeses. “It has a very honest and open feel, and we’re able to have that connection with our customers that I’d been missing. That said, we have sanitiser at the door and counter, and ask people to pay by card when possible. “Our delivery van is used by more than one member of staff, so it has been kitted out with sanitiser and gloves. We also try to minimise the number of staff who are working at close quarters on shift. “When we could only serve takeaway, we realised that people had the habit of getting a loaf and some sweet things and heading off for a picnic. Because of there being more takeaway we had to invest in packaging, we went for the compostable type. I’m surrounded by boxes of boxes! “In terms of opening more fully, we’re waiting for confirmation on whether we’ll have to do table service once people can eat inside, and when we know we’ll arrange the seating accordingly. “It’s strange because everybody is going to open at the same time, but we’re so lucky as our customers are so loyal.” We can all play our part in keeping each other safe.

Nonetheless, the sector itself is proving resilient eight out of 10 people, according to a survey conducted by the Royal Institute of British Architects (Riba) in October, wanted to change their homes as soon as it was safe to do so. “The impact of Covid-19 will affect how and where we choose to live for years to come,” says Riba president Alan Jones. “For many of us, our homes are our sanctuaries, and this research indicates that many people are keener than ever to adapt and improve their homes.” Many interior designers across the UK report an increase in the number of new clients they have taken on. But as the process relies so heavily on being physically present in a space, they have had to adapt. Zoe Hewett is no stranger to finding creative ways around problems. When she first started her interior design business, Stylemongers of Bristol, the former set designer for theatre and TV productions lacked the funds to make over her own home to serve as a showcase – so instead she built a doll’s house to demonstrate her style. As a result of the pandemic, Hewett scaled back her face-to-face work, but has still found ways of expanding her business – one of which is a range of interior design kits to help people design their own homes. “At first, I was thinking about making my services accessible,” she says. “A one-to-one design consultation is worth doing for a bespoke service, but it’s always going to be out of reach for some people, so I wanted to offer something affordable, at a price point more people could afford.” The pandemic meant the project became a priority for her business, and the packs became a reality. “I may have created an envelope-stuffing role for myself,” she says. “But I love that people are getting something physical and tangible to work with.” The packs are made of recycled card and paper and are delivered in letterbox-sized packages. Hewett sees them as a way of sharing the information and techniques that she previously discussed in face-to-face workshops, where she would guide groups through the principles of interior design – from creating moodboards to where to place furniture. They contain, among other things, quizzes to help buyers explore design choices, advice on using colour and materials to create 2D-scale layouts of rooms, plus a link to an ebook with further information. Hewett says the take-up of the £50 kits has been “pretty good. I hope people find them fun as well as useful. One lady who bought one said she’s using it again with her seven-year-old to reimagine their shed. Her daughter’s got really into it, apparently.” From each commission, Hewett makes a donation to the homeless charity Crisis. “Creating nice places is what drives me,” she says. “So it makes sense to me to also help people who haven’t got anywhere to live yet.” The community focus is also important to Liselle Milner of Zenterior Design, based in St Austell, Cornwall. She works with 12 others, including builders, carpenters and upholsterers, to create indoor and outdoor spaces and bespoke furniture, all with a focus on using sustainable materials. Much of her work involves second homes or holiday lets, so the owners have not been able to travel to meet her. “We’ve always focused on the relationship with the client, getting an idea of exactly what it is they want and then making that happen, so to never meet someone face-to-face has been very odd,” she says. “Although, if you are talking to someone via Zoom, there is the advantage of seeing their house in the background, so it’s a very quick way of seeing what they already like.” Milner uses a lot of secondhand or upcycled furniture – “I want the space to look as amazing as possible for the budget we have” – but her pre-pandemic visits to charity shops and auctions have been replaced by Facebook Marketplace, and ever-greater resourcefulness as a team. “We’re looking at things we would usually outsource, like quilting, for example, and thinking: ‘Can we do that ourselves?’” she says. “It’s good creatively, and it also means we can keep to a schedule. Big furniture retailers have set specifics they work to. If a piece is made of oak, and if the oak isn’t there, then that sofa won’t be with you in 12 weeks’ time. But if we are making it, then we can use beech or another suitable wood that we can actually get hold of.” Besides changing their ways of working to comply with pandemic-related restrictions, such as visiting sites inidually instead of together, the Zenterior team have also adapted some of the other physical parts of their jobs, finding ways to keep to social distancing rules, and have stopped working on occupied domestic properties. Milner has also doubled down on Zenterior’s commitment to using local suppliers, not only to avoid delays with supply chains but also from a sense of local responsibility, as the regional tourism sector has been hit especially hard by restrictions on movement. “And there’s also the fact that Cornwall has always been a hub for artists and creative people. It makes sense to work with people who are here,” says Milner. The pandemic may have affected their traditional ways of working for now, but both Milner and Hewett are determined that its lasting effects on our homes are sustainably positive.

Biden has also called for the creation of a Neighborhood Homes Tax Credit to support the development of affordable housing and a $5 billion grant program to expand housing options for Americans with low or moderate incomes. Finally, the president has indicated he would like to invest $31 billion to expand efforts to support minority-owned small businesses. However, it is very unclear if any of these initiatives will make it into the final version of the infrastructure bill. Senate Republicans have proposed a $257 billion bill, much smaller than the $1.7 trillion infrastructure package that Biden is pushing, and it’s possible that proposals like those above may end up getting cut from the legislation. The White House has just confirmed Biden will meet with Republican Senator Shelley Moore Capito to discuss her team’s latest offer. That meeting will likely offer insight into the size and scope of the final bill.Joe Biden will travel today to Tulsa, Oklahoma, to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the city’s race massacre, which targeted affluent African Americans and their businesses. Ahead of the president’s trip, the White House announced this morning a series of new initiatives aimed at narrowing the country’s racial wealth gap. The administration pledged to take action to address racial housing discrimination and use its purchasing power to direct an additional $100 Billion to small disadvantaged business owners.  The trip and the administration’s announcement come two weeks after three living survivors of the massacre -- Viola Fletcher, Hughes Van Ellis and Lessie Evelyn Benningfield Randle -- testified to Congress about the need to compensate massacre survivors and their descendants. “I am here seeking justice,” Fletcher said at the House subcommittee hearing. “I am here asking my country to acknowledge what happened in Tulsa in 1921.” The blog will have more details on the trip coming up, so stay tuned.

Since then, over 250,000 people have been diagnosed in the State, and more than 4,900 people have died.Globally, over 150 million people have been diagnosed and over 3\u0026nbspmillion have died since the virus was first identified in China in December 2019.Four of these have been authorised for use in the EU - one from AstraZeneca, one from BioNTech-Pfizer, one from Moderna and another from Johnson \u0026amp Johnson (Jannsen).The EU has put in place purchase agreements with Sanofi-GSK\u0026nbspand Curevac, and\u0026nbsphas concluded exploratory talks with two other vaccine producers - Novavax and Valneva.Ireland, along with all other EU member states, will get a proportional amount of every vaccine that is approved for use by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) according to its population.But how do these other vaccines work, and when will they be approved for use here? Have there been any reported side effects? And when can you expect to receive a vaccine?The  Vaccine Tracker will be updated daily as the country embarks on the largest inoculation programme in the history of the State.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 70°C.EMA approval: Granted on December 21st.Overview: Developed by New York-based Pfizer and German company BioNTech this vaccine has a brand name of Comirnaty. It uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which has instructions for producing a protein from Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The person’s immune system recognises this protein as foreign and produces antibodies and activates T-cells (white blood cells) to attack it, giving them immunity. The vaccine will last for six months when stored at -70C, and five days when stored at between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. The EU has approved the withdrawal of six doses from each vial.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle and joint pain, chills and fever. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 546,000 in April, 738,000 in May and\u0026nbsp844,000 doses in June, with 5.4 million doses in total expected by the end of 2021.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 20°C.EMA approval: Granted on January 6th.Overview: Developed by Boston-based company Moderna, this vaccine is manufactured for EU states at partner plants in Switzerland, France and Spain before being distributed across the continent. Like the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, it uses mRNA technology to produce a Sars-CoV-2 protein, which the body then attacks to give immunity. It will last for up to six months when stored at - 20°C. The first Moderna vaccine was given in Ireland on January 16th.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, chills, fever, swollen or tender lymph nodes under the arm, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea and vomiting. Less common was redness, hives and rash at the injection site. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 383,000 by June and 870,000 doses by the end of 2021.How many have been vaccinated here?EMA approval: Granted on January 29th.Overview: The OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine (also known as Vaxzevria) was thought of as a potential game-changer because it can be transported and stored at 2 degrees to 8 degrees for up to six months, making it much easier to move around and administer. It is also much cheaper, costing about $3-4 per shot, compared with $20 for the PfizerBioNTech jab, with the former being made on a not-for-profit basis for the duration of the pandemic.It is based on a harmless chimp cold virus that cannot grow inside human cells. Scientists have tweaked this virus so that it carries genetic material containing the instructions for a protein of the coronavirus. Once the vaccine has been administered, our bodies produce the coronavirus protein, triggering an immune response.During the trial, a dosing error led to the serendipitous finding that when clinical trial participants were given half a dose followed by a full dose, the vaccine had a higher efficacy than when participants were given two full doses, with 90 per cent efficacy in the former case and 62 per cent efficacy in the latter. This led AstraZeneca to announce in November a new global trial of the vaccine with the half dosefull dose regime.In January, a bitter row broke out between the European Union and AstraZeneca after the pharmaceutical company drastically revised downwards the number of doses it could deliver the bloc.\u0026nbspWhile the EMA approved the use of this vaccine for all ages, doubt was cast over its efficacy in the over 65s due to the lack of data from Astrazeneca’s clinical trials in this cohort. As a result, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Poland and Belgium have opted not to approve this product for their older population.Following suit, Ireland has also decided to use the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine for the over 70s where possible, not the AstraZeneca jab.It would not be the first time this jab led to a\u0026nbspsignificant reorganisation of our vaccination plans.Reports of serious blood clots, mostly in women aged under 60, led the\u0026nbspNational Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac) to first defer the use of the vaccine on March 14th, before resuming it\u0027s use on March 20th.However, on April 12th, Niac\u0026nbsprecommended that AstraZeneca should not be given to people aged under 60, once again leading to a reorganisation of the rollout. This was revised to people aged over 50 on April 27th.\u0026nbspHow many will Ireland get?\u0026nbspLatest projections are 224,000 in April, 262,000 in May and 327,000 in JuneStorage: Lasts for up to two years frozen at –20° C, and up to three months refrigerated at 2–8° C.EMA approval: Approved on March 11th.Overview: The EMA started a rolling review of this single dose vaccine from Janssen, the Belgium-based subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson on December 1st .On January 29th the company announced the results of its Phase 3 trial: the vaccine had an efficacy of 72 per cent in the United States, 66 per cent in Latin America, and 57 per cent in South Africa.This vaccine uses double-stranded DNA to deliver a protein from the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the body, thereby creating immunity. It is different from others on the market in that it requires just one injection. The EU has agreed an initial contract for 200 million doses, with an option to buy 200 million more.On February 16th the company applied to the EMA for\u0026nbspseeking authorisation for its single-dose vaccine, and it was approved on March 11th.However, on April 13th the company paused deliveries of its vaccine in Europe pending an investigation of rare blood clot cases that have halted its rollout in the US. The blood clotting conditions reported in recipients of the Johnson \u0026amp Johnson vaccine in the US are the same rare condition linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine.On April 20th, the EMA\u0027s review of these issues found a possible link to very rare cases of unusual blood clots with low blood platelets, and agreed a warning should be included in the product information.\u0026nbspHowever, it concluded\u0026nbspthe overall benefits of the vaccine\u0026nbspin preventing Covid-19 outweigh the risks of side effects, and so Janssen announced it would resume deliveries to the EU. In Ireland,\u0026nbspNiac recommended that the jab be used only for people over the age of 50.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbsp2.2 million doses in total,\u0026nbsp600,000 between April and June.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: US company Novavax has developed a Covid-19 vaccine which stimulates an immune response by delivering spike proteins into the body. These spike-proteins are grown and harvested from insects. Similar technology is used in the production of vaccines for influenza and HPV. The European Commission has concluded exploratory talks with Novavax with a view to purchasing up to 200 million doses. The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 3rd.Overview: In September the EU signed a deal to purchase 300 million doses of this vaccine. It is based on the same technology as one of Sanofi’s seasonal influenza vaccines - more conventional than the mRNA used by Pfizer and Moderna - and it was thought it could play a big role in ending the pandemic. However, despite positive results from Phase 1 trials, news came in December that Phase 2 trial results showed an insufficient immune response in older adults. Phase III studies were expected to start in December, but the companies now plan to begin a phase 2b study in February with a different formulation of the vaccine. Even if their new formulation is successful, they do not expect the vaccine to be available until the end of 2021.Storage: Will last for at least 3 months at 2–8°C.Overview: The German company CureVac began its final Phase 3 trials in December, with results expected in the first quarter of 2021. It uses the same mRNA technology as the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, but can be kept at normal refrigerator temperatures. The company has signed a deal with the EU to supply 405 million doses, pending regulatory approval.The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 12th.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: Valneva is a French company which has created a Covid-19 vaccine based on their Japanese encephalitis vaccine. It delivers a chemically inactivated coronavirus and uses an adjuvant (immunity booster) to create immunity. It entered clinical trials in December and reported positive results from these initial phase 1 and 2 trial in\u0026nbspApril 2021, while announcing it was entering\u0026nbspphase 3 trials on 4,000 people.On January 12th the European Commission concluded exploratory talks with the company for the supply of 30 million doses, with the option to buy a further 30 million.When might you be vaccinated?The HSE is currently vaccinating people in the top nine cohorts:\u0026nbsppeople aged 65\u0026nbspand older who live in long-term care facilities (cohort 1), frontline healthcare workers (cohort 2), people aged 70 and older (cohort 3), people aged 16 to 69 who are at very high or high risk (cohort 4 and 7) and those aged 50 to 69 (cohorts 5 and 9).\u0026nbspThe next groups to be offered a vaccine after this will be residents of long-term care facilities aged 16-64 (cohort 8), followed by people aged 64 years and younger, alongside people aged 64 and younger who are living or working in crowded settings.

Medics have reported what they believe to be the first case of Covid-19 reinfection in the State.  Photograph: Manjunath KiranAFP via Getty Images. Medics have reported what they believe to be the first case of Covid-19 reinfection in the State.In a paper published in the Irish Medical Journal (IMJ), the medics explain that female healthcare worker (40) contracted Covid-19 seven months after originally falling ill with the disease last year.Dr Cillian de Gascun, director of the National Virus Reference Laboratory at University College Dublin, is one of the co-authors of the paper, which states that “to our knowledge, this is the first report of re-infection from Ireland”.The paper says the health worker presented with fever, headache, sore throat, shortness of breath and dysgeusia in April of last year and was diagnosed with Covid-19.“While never hospitalised, she was unfit for work for four weeks due to significant headaches and persistent fatigue lasting four months,” it states. The paper says that one of the woman’s two household contacts also developed Covid-19 at that time.It goes on to say that the health worker presented with cough, sore throat, headache, fatigue and myalgia again last November. She was again diagnosed with Covid-19 using whole genome sequencing.However, the paper states that the woman’s symptoms were milder and a faster recovery took place second time around. She remained off work for the two week period of self-isolation and reports a post-infection wheeze which is being controlled with low dose inhaler.The paper, entitled ‘Genomic Evidence of SARS-CoV-2 Reinfection in Ireland’, also had an input from the HSE’s Health Protection Surveillance Centre and from Dr Sinead O’Donnell of the Department of of Clinical Microbiology at the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland.Significant consequencesThe authors state that the consequences of Covid-19 re-infection “are significant in health care workers due to the impact on service delivery and cross infection in other health care workers and patients”.They state that “the incidence of Covid-19 reinfection is not well characterised” and that “infection control precautions may still be required in healthcare facilities while SARS-CoV-2 remains in circulation”.The paper states that vaccines have shown efficacy rates of 70 per cent to 95 per cent in clinical trials, however, the effectiveness in populations and the durability of immunity is yet to be evaluated.The authors add that “further study into the level and duration of immunity conferred by both infection with and vaccination against SARS-Cov-2 (Covid-19) is required to inform future vaccination campaigns and infection prevention and control policy”."},{"url":null,"title":"irish third level sector needs significant funding to capitalise on brexit","story":"Third level institutions in Ireland have the potential to attract substantial numbers of additions overseas students post-Brexit but need investment to do so, a Seanad Special Select Committee has been told. File photograph: Dara MacDónaill  The Third level institutions will find it difficult to cater to the demand from Erasmus students who are opting to study in Ireland instead of the UK due to Brexit, the Seanad Special Select Committee on the Withdrawal of the UK from the EU has heard.Representatives from various third level bodies said Irish colleges and universities will struggle to capitalise on the increased numbers of EU and non-EU students choosing to come to Ireland in the wake of Brexit, due to years of chronic under-investment.Concerns were also raised that Erasmus exchanges, traineeships and work placements, facilitated between Irish and UK colleges, would be withdrawn after the academic year 202223, when the UK formally leaves the Erasmus programme.Students from the Republic who attend colleges in the North, and vice versa, also need clarity regarding their status as international students, the committee heard.Jim Miley, director general of the Irish Universities Association (IUA), said that a substantial number of students who would previously have chosen the UK for their degree programme or for an Erasmus exchange are now likely to opt for Ireland due to Brexit.“More than 120,000 non-UK EU students studied in the UK annually before Brexit. While these students paid high tuition fees, they had access to government grantloan funding to assist with the costs, paid back on graduation. “Access to this funding is no longer available and students who do not have the ability to cover the higher non-EU tuition fees will seek alternative destinations. “The 2021 application deadline to UCAS showed that the number of EU applicants stood at 26,010, down from 43,030 the previous year, a drop of 40 per cent. Ireland should aim to be the preferred alternative destination for these students.”However, the Irish higher education sector will need serious investment to cater to these students, said Mr Miley. The ratio of staff to students in Ireland’s third level institutions is quite low, and facility upgrades are needed. “Capacity constraints could limit Ireland’s ability to absorb this demand,” he warned.He added that the UK was now specifically marketing itself to non-EU international students, so Ireland may not have much of an advantage as previously thought, as the only English-speaking country in the EU. “Rankings are far more potent factors in attracting international students. The lack of adequate investment in the university sector over the last decade means that Ireland has lost ground in rankings and is not in a position to compete as effectively in the highly competitive international student market.”With regards to research activities, which mainly concerns Masters students, PhDs and staff, Nora Trench Bowles of the IUA said Ireland’s Government Budget Allocation for Research and Development (GBARD) has been consistently below 1 per cent of total expenditure since 2012, reaching an all-time low of 0.93 per cent in 2018. “This is well below the EU average for GBARD, which is 1.34 per cent of total government expenditure. Ireland’s is almost half that of key competitor countries such as Denmark, ” she said. An additional €350 million per year would be needed to bring Ireland into line with the EU average.She said other issues, such as housing, the cost of childcare, and the lack of work opportunities for researcher’s families were also hindering Ireland’s research potential.The sector’s ability to purchase lab supplies and building materials is also being affected by Brexit, with Mr Miley warning that building costs of current projects are already costing more than planned.

Illustration: HammersonLong-awaited plans to regenerate one Dublin’s most notorious neglected sites, the 5.5-acre plot stretching from O’Connell Street to Moore Street, have finally been lodged with Dublin City Council.UK property group Hammerson is seeking permission for a mixed retail, office and residential scheme on the large north inner city block formerly known as the Carlton site, parts of which have lain vacant and derelict for more than 40 years.If planning permission is granted, construction is expected to begin in 2023 and be completed in 2030.Hammerson two years ago decided to scrap the existing 2010 planning permission for a €1.25 billion enclosed shopping complex on the site which runs west from O’Connell Street to Moore Street, and north of Henry Street to Parnell Street.Instead it plans a more open scheme which will restore the historic street pattern, and will include a new east-west pedestrian street between O’Connell Street and Moore Street, two new civic squares, shops, offices, apartments, hotels and an underground station for the new link rail line.The plans from architect by Friedrich Ludewig of Acme, working with Irish firms Grafton, RKD and MOLA differ from the concept designs produced by Acme two years ago.Gone is the dramatic canopy of tall lily-pad-like structures to shelter the new pedestrian street, leading from O’Connell Street, from the elements, in favour of a fully-open street.The quantum of retail planned is also significantly reduced from the 2019 proposal of 23,500sq m. The new plan will have just 8,000sq m of shops restaurants and cafes, with 44,000sq m of office space, 210 hotel rooms and 94 apartments.Initial applicationThe applications are being submitted in phases, with three out of six applications submitted on Tuesday morning and more to follow in the coming months. The initial applications focus on lands situated on the west side of the site and include residential, hotel, retail, restaurant and café and cultural uses.The company said the site’s heritage will be “retained and celebrated” with a new archway on Moore Street to commemorate the Easter Rising, for which the 1916 Relatives Association has suggested names. All “pre-1916 buildings and fabric along Moore Street” will also be retained, the company said.In 2018 the Court of Appeal overturned a declaration that buildings on and around Moore Street, part of the Hammerson site, constituted a national monument following a case taken by the State.State-owned buildings at 14-17 Moore Street remain national monuments and are due to be developed separately as a 1916 Rising Commemorative Centre, a project expected to cost at least €16.25 million.The site was for years known as the Carlton site as originally it just encompassed the old Carlton cinema, the plot beside it that had been vacant since 1979, and some backlands between O’Connell Street and Moore Street.Cinema restorationAs part of the new scheme, the facade of the old cinema will be restored, though the cinema itself will not be retained in situ. Three protected structures, 42 O’Connell Street - the last remaining Georgian house on the street, O’Connell Hall at the back of No 42, and Conway’s pub, will also be restored.Taoiseach Micheál Martin on Tuesday welcomed the plans which he said would “enhance the status of O’Connell Street” and increase visitors to the area.“Government has already allocated significant funding to complete the conservation of the State owned buildings at Nos. 14 -17 Moore Street and to create new visitor and exhibition facilities to the rear. As the plans for Dublin Central develop it is important to continue to liaise with the street traders and those concerned with heritage conservation,” he said.A Government appointment advisory group on the future of the street last month recommended a once-off compensation payment should be made to the last remaining traders on the street who would not be able to operate their stalls once development starts.The Moore Street Advisory Group, chaired by academic Tom Collins, and which included traders’ representatives and relatives of those involved in the Rising, had said there was “not universal support” for all aspects of Hammerson’s plans for the street, but there was a “broad welcome” for how they had evolved from the earlier shopping centre proposal, the group said.There were “members who feel that the heritage considerations in the plan are a gesture toward history but do not go far enough” Mr Collins said.Businesses who operate shops on the street have also expressed concern about their prospects for survival, particularly during the long construction phase of the development.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4578151.1622218335!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_620/image.jpg","title":"young people have saved pup to take summer off says hotelier","story":"Many young people who would normally work in the hospitality industry during the summer are taking a break instead and living off their savings from the pandemic unemployment payment (PUP), a west Cork hotelier has claimed.PJ McMahon, operations manager at the Schull Harbour Hotel, said it was a slow process hiring staff for this week’s reopening.Mr McMahon, who has worked in the hotel industry since he was 16, said the sector had been struggling to hire staff long before Covid struck. But it had been especially difficult this summer with freedom finally on the cards for young people who have had a difficult year.“A lot of them would have made enough money with the PUP payment over the winter,” he said. “They couldn’t spend it. There was nothing open. There was no nightlife there. So they made enough money that they don’t need to work for the summer.”“They still aren’t able to spend it. They are not spending €100 a week in pubs or nightclubs. They are spending €20 on a bag of cans and sitting on a pier.“These people have been locked up for the last six months. They want to embrace the situation where they are out at the weekend, out with their friends. I can understand it.                                                                    “To be honest, the thoughts of working through the summer at weekends … I will be here ... but many people don’t want to do that.”Mr McMahon said some young people had gone off the PUP payment and straight in to jobs in supermarkets or call centres where the hours were more amenable to social life.He said people also avoided the hotel sector because of the perceived lack of stability.“Bars have been closed for 18 months and we have been shut down three times. A lot of people have moved on to more secure jobs.”Quality of lifeMr McMahon has also encountered job applicants who only want to work from Monday to Friday “because they have realised that there is quality of life out there at the moment. They want to embrace the weekends.”“Unfortunately for an industry like ourselves we are not a Monday-to-Friday operation. It is seven days a week 80 per cent of our business is on a Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday.”Mr McMahon said in generations past, hotel workers came up through the now defunct state training agency Cert and the industry didn’t have the “lowly” status it has now.He added he had spoken to countless people in the industry about the difficulties in recruiting staff for hotels. “Everyone is struggling. Chefs are probably the biggest struggle ... A lot of chefs have worked six months out of the last 18 so many have moved on to other jobs.”The big hope was that there would be no further closures, said Mr McMahon who was complimentary of Government supports to the industry and of the PUP payment itself.“There is loads of grants out there and I think the Government have been very good. I can’t fault them. We are just hopeful that this is it for closures.”Hotels across the State are due to reopen their doors on Wednesday, while outdoor dining will return next Monday.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"edwin poots to announce new ministers when i m ready","story":"DUP leader Edwin Poots at a press conference at Stormont  where he met with the party’s assembly members. Photograph: Mark MarlowPA WireThe new DUP leader Edwin Poots has said he will announce his new ministerial team “when I’m ready to do it”.Mr Poots, who was ratified as the party leader following an acrimonious meeting of the party’s executive in Belfast on Thursday, had previously indicated that he could reveal a reshuffle as early as Tuesday.Instead he announced several backroom appointments following a meeting with DUP MLAs at Stormont on Tuesday morning.“I will not be pushed into doing it, nor will I be held back from doing it ... a course of work is being done in terms of my engagement with MPs, MLAs and colleagues, that course of work is coming close to completion and I’ll make my announcement in a number of days when I’m ready,” he told reporters after the meeting.Asked if the delay was down to isions within the party and attempts to heal that ide, Mr Poots replied “absolutely not”, adding that he was “working very extensively to ensure that we get the right team with the right balance.”He also rejected the suggestion that the delay was down to behind-the-scenes negotiations with Sinn Féin in order to avoid a potential political crisis amid calls from the party that the DUP must follow through on commitments made to deliver Irish language legislation.‘No ultimatums’“Certainly, I have received no ultimatums nor do I expect to receive an ultimatum, because we must remember the last time that the Assembly wasn’t operative our health waiting lists went through the roof,” Mr Poots said.“So we have now over 300,000 people on the health waiting lists, that is not satisfactory, and I can’t imagine that any of the parties wouldn’t nominate and wouldn’t want to ensure that the Assembly runs its full term.Mr Poots on Tuesday announced a number of internal party appointments and said there were “further announcements to be made in a number of days’ time.”The East Belfast Assembly member Joanne Bunting becomes Chief Whip, the Upper Bann MLA Jonathan Buckley is to be Mr Poots’ Chief of Staff, and the party’s new deputy leader, Paula Bradley, and party secretary Michelle McIlveen will take on new roles with responsibility for the welfare of the party’s elected representatives.The Lagan Valley MLA Paul Given is understood to be the most likely candidate for the post of first minister, with the North Antrim MLA Mervyn Storey believed to have ruled himself out.Ms Bradley and the former minister Ms McIlveen are also believed to be under consideration for ministerial office.The Lagan Valley MP Jeffrey Donaldson, who was narrowly defeated by Mr Poots in the leadership election, said ision within the party needed to be tackled.“Those concerns do need to be addressed and I hope that Edwin and his team will look very carefully at what is being said ... we will wait and see what the party leader does in terms of his ministerial appointments.”In regard to the next steps by the outgoing First Minister, the former DUP leader Arlene Foster, Mr Donaldson said “these are very personal decisions and it’s not for me to encroach on all of that.“What we need in Northern Ireland is a unionism that reaches out, is a unionism that is strong, is a unionism that promotes that case for the union,” he said. “That’s what we need to be doing now.”End of this monthMs Foster had previously said she would stay on until the end of this month, but last week indicated she would step down immediately if Mr Poots nominated an alternative ministerial team.“If Edwin decides that he wants to change that team, I will have to go as well because I can’t stay with a new ministerial team of which I have no authority, and that would be wrong,” she told reporters on Friday.Under the power-sharing rules at Stormont, once Ms Foster resigns, the Deputy First Minister, Michelle O’Neill of Sinn Féin, also ceases to hold office.There is a seven-day time limit for both parties to nominate a candidate to fill the respective positions, and agree each other’s choices, or an election must be held.Speaking on Tuesday the Northern Secretary, Brandon Lewis, said people in Northern Ireland had previously had “three long years without any government locally” and wanted to see politicians working together and delivering on the commitments made in the New Decade, New Approach agreement which restored the North’s power-sharing Assembly in 2020.“I think all the party leaders are acutely aware of that and I think they do want to work towards having a good stable Executive, and I will certainly be doing all I can to work with them and talk to them as I have done over the last few days,” he said.

Photograph: Niall CarsonPA WireThe Government has decided against taking any substantial new measures to deal with large crowds socialising in Dublin, Cork and Galway and other urban centres.In informal discussions ahead of Tuesday’s Cabinet meeting, Ministers decided they would not bring the reopening of outdoor dining forward from next week (to prevent a repeat of such gatherings) but would focus instead on repeating public health messaging about social distancing, mask-wearing and the risks associated with congregated settings, even outdoor.Tánaiste Leo Varadkar confirmed on Monday that the June 7th reopening day for outdoor hospitality remains unchanged.However, the Cabinet will also discuss if there are ways to make more toilets available to the public while hospitality businesses remain closed for indoor dining and drinking. While some restaurants and pubs doing takeaway services were allowing the public to use their bathrooms, there were discussions yesterday involving officials from several departments to see if councils and businesses could find ways of providing more facilities. Human waste was found outside some premises in Dublin over the weekend.                                                                    Policing visibility“It’s a combination of sunny weather and pubs being closed,” said one source, who added that the situation would change once full reopening occurs.Another Government source said there was little appetite to “go too heavy” on younger people who had given up a lot during the lockdown. While saying that large crowds were not helpful, there was not the same pressure to move against such meetings as had been the case with house parties around Christmas.“There is not a big desire to increase policing visibility too much as at least the crowds are outdoors and it is coming to the end of lockdown.“It is mainly repeating the messaging and encouraging people to remain safe,” said the source.Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly said the public needed to continue adhering to public health measures even in the final stages of high-level restrictions.“We are on a pathway out of this pandemic, but this virus has taught us that if we let our guard down then we are set back on our journey to return to a more ‘normal’ life,” he said.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"how joe biden came around to the wuhan lab leak theory","story":"Members of the World Health Organisation  team investigating the origins of the  coronavirus pandemic arrive  at the Wuhan Institute of Virology  on February 3rd last. Photograph: Hector RetamalAFP via Getty ImagesWhen US president Joe Biden last week ordered US intelligence to intensify efforts to determine the origins of Covid-19, he gave fresh life to the theory that the virus may have leaked from the Wuhan Institute of Virology. Biden said US intelligence had “coalesced around two scenarios” – that the virus had either emerged naturally or was the result of a lab accident.It was the first time that the president had given credence to the possibility that the virus had leaked from a lab – a notion widely slammed as a conspiracy theory when Donald Trump first made the claim.Current and former officials said there were several reasons why the Biden administration was willing to publicly entertain a theory that Democrats had once slammed.A crucial factor was that critics were more open to the lab-leak theory now that Trump, who was viewed as wanting to vilify China to deflect blame for his handling of the pandemic, was out of office.They also said Biden was reacting to what the intelligence had found. He is now under political pressure to find answers.“The Biden administration has now studied the mountain of disturbing evidence that we were confronted with in the last few months of the Trump administration,” said David Asher, who led a state department investigation into the origins of Covid. “It is jaw dropping. And as they have noted, a great deal more needs to be assessed.”Days before Biden was sworn in, the state department issued a fact sheet on the Wuhan institute that said several researchers had fallen ill with Covid-like symptoms before the first publicly known case. It also said the institute had worked secretly with the Chinese military.Critics did not take the claim seriously because of the view that thren secretary of state Mike Pompeo tended to politicise intelligence. People were also focused on the aftermath of the riots on January 6th and Biden’s inauguration.“We assumed the fact sheet wasn’t going to make immediate headlines. We wanted to put the information into the record so that people could reckon with these facts when tensions and fevers had dropped,” said David Feith, a former state department official who was involved in the release.Lab-leak theoryIn March, Asher said publicly that some Wuhan staff were so sick they were hospitalised. That and a recent Wall Street Journal story that three staff were hospitalised, helped focus attention on the lab-leak theory.But one person familiar with the debate said the driving factor was a shift among scientists who had been wary of helping Trump before the election or angering influential scientists who had dismissed the theory. He said this had helped make Democrats more willing to consider the theory.“The most important thing that has happened is that prominent virologists have since spoken out,” he said.In a letter to the Science journal, a group of 18 prominent scientists said both theories were “viable” and should be taken “seriously” until sufficient data were obtained. They said the recent investigation that the World Health Organisation conducted with China had not given balanced consideration to both scenarios.“Even those of us working the issue inside the government were not well aware of how much scientific opinion was on our side because scientists were generally not speaking up, but you have had certain dams break over the past few months,” said Feith, referring to developments including the letter and the WHO investigation.Anthony Fauci, head of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, also appeared to change his stance. Last year, he said the science “strongly indicates” the virus emerged naturally, but he recently said he was “not convinced” and backed an investigation.While Biden was just outlining the view of the intelligence community in his highly unusual statement, his willingness to make their tentative conclusions public also shone more attention on the lab-leak theory.Mathew Burrows, a former senior intelligence official, said he could not remember a president making such a statement, saying they have historically not wanted to be viewed as trying to force a conclusion.Political pressureMike Gallagher, a Republican congressman who has introduced a bill to declassify all the intelligence related to the investigation, also said that Biden appeared to be responding to political pressure, particularly after members of his team called on China to allow a transparent investigation – something few experts believe Beijing will allow.“Biden was feeling the pressure,” said Gallagher. “They felt a little bit of blowback ... but it’s a good move.”One person familiar with the situation said the National Intelligence Council, which collates information from the entire intelligence community, produced two reports last year assessing US intelligence on the origins of Covid. The director for national intelligence declined to comment.Those efforts, coupled with a third “scrub” of the intelligence this year, led to Biden saying last week that two of the 18 branches of the intelligence community leaned towards the natural origin scenario, while a third was more inclined towards the lab-leak theory.Biden said the three had only “low or moderate confidence” in their conclusions while the other branches did not have enough evidence. That has sparked concern that 90 days is not sufficient for intelligence officials to reach any solid determination.“The community as a whole is far away from reaching anything that we could call even a halfway firm conclusion,” said Paul Pillar, a former senior CIA official. “The fact that many of the agencies involved have not reached a consensus even for a ‘low confidence’ judgment tells you they’re a long way away from anything conclusive.”– Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2021Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons may 2021","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2020 by clicking here or call 0844 871 1514. To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178Coronavirus latest news: Delay reopening to avoid another lockdown cycle, warns vaccine adviser - watch livePolitics latest news: Boris Johnson must ignore \u0026#39coordinated and deliberate\u0026#39 push to delay June 21 roadmap, says Iain Duncan Smith - watch liveWho is next on the list for Covid vaccines - and how will I be invited to book an appointment?Comment: In the Czech Republic, lockdown restrictions are challenged by lawyers.

That makes him a very safe and secure choice.”An austere greybeard in a black-turban – a sign of descendancy from the prophet – Mr Raisi is a behind-the-scenes apparatchik who rose quickly through the ranks of the judiciary after the Islamic revolution, along the way developing close ties to the Supreme Leader and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. Mr Raisi also married well, to the daughter of the well-connected Friday prayer leader of Mashhad, Ahmad Alamolhoda. His father-in-law is “probably a force pushing this guy forwards,” said Alex Vatanka, director of the Iran programme at the Middle East Institute. That facilitated his rise, allowing him to join Iran’s Assembly of Experts in 2006 – a prerequisite for any supreme leader – despite middling theological credentials, Mr Vatanka said.His behind-the-scenes rise took a public turn in 2017 when he ran in elections against President Rouhani, even though every incumbent since 1981 has won re-election. On the campaign trail he has travelled to neglected provinces to hear the grievances of the poor, blaming moderates like President Rouhani for weakness in the face of Western sanctions.  With Ayatollah Khamenei directing major decisions, Iran’s foreign policy would be unlikely to change drastically under a Raisi presidency, experts say, though his suspicion of the West is clear.But sanctions against him could be a sticking point amid ongoing negotiations over Iran and the United States returning to the nuclear deal. In 2019, as part of former president Donald Trump’s maximum pressure campaign against Iran, the US sanctioned Mr Raisi, charging him with administrative oversight of executions of minors, torture, and inhumane punishment. They also cited his involvement in the regime’s brutal crackdown on the Green Movement protests following the 2009 election. Should he win the election, President Joe Biden may lift sanctions on Mr Raisi for pragmatic reasons, said Leigh Hansson, a sanctions expert and partner at Reed Smith law firm. “It’s going to be difficult engaging with someone who is currently under sanctions by the US,” she said. “I think they’re going to have to do something specifically to remove those sanctions on him.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"decade bibism israeli right has decided time change","story":"Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s longest-serving prime minister, was closer than ever on Sunday night to finally leaving office.A series of extraordinary political twists have produced a erse coalition containing left-wing parties, right-wing parties that support the West Bank settlement movement, centrist parties, and the party that represents the Islamic Movement in Israel, whose voters are mostly Palestinian-Israelis. What they all have in common is their revulsion for Benjamin Netanyahu, who is standing trial on a string of corruption charges.The government has not yet been sworn in, and the Israeli political system is used to seeing Netanyahu wriggle out of every political crisis at the last minute. But this time, most of the players believe, his chances are slimmer than ever.The “change coalition”, as it is known, looked like a non-starter a week ago. Its designated leader, former defence minister Naftali Bennett, the leader of the Yamina right-wing party, announced that the renewed fighting with Gaza and the riots in Israel between Arabs and Jews had convinced him that this coalition stood no chance.A few days ago, it became clear once more that there was no chance of Netanyahu establishing a right-wing government, and Bennett resumed talks with the chief architect of the alternative government-in-waiting, the chairman of the centrist Yesh Atid Party, Yair Lapid.On Sunday night, Bennett appeared on live TV and said that he would form a positive-minded government that would appeal to all Israelis, and which would be “more right-wing than the current government”.He thanked the left for its “generosity”, but promised that the new government would not “relinquish territory” or pursue unilateral withdrawals.From these remarks, it is easy to understand the challenges facing the new government: it brings together progressive left-wing parties with a religious right-wing party, all headed by a prime minister who will control just six seats in the 120-seat Knesset.This government patently is making no pretence of pursuing a peace process with the Palestinians, and it is also clear that it cannot propose sweeping reforms in the domain of religion and state, a critical issue for so many Israelis.The fall of Benjamin Netanyahu cannot be chalked up to the strength of the Israeli centre-left, which remains a minority in Israeli society, but to the rise of the a conservative right which opposes his rule, and identifies his brand of leadership as “Bibism”: a cult of loyalty to the leader himself above all other ideological principles.Israel has been dragged through four election cycles in the last two years, and in none of them did the bloc of parties that support Netanyahu manage to obtain a majority in the Knesset, the Israeli parliament.In the last election, a centrist party joined forces with Netanyahu to form a government that was supposed to include a rotating premiership between Netanyahu and his rival Benny Gantz but Netanyahu violated the agreement the moment he signed it and pushed the country toward elections, because he refused to relinquish his seat — not even in two years’ time.In the fourth elections, it turned out that again that Netanyahu had no majority, and two right-wing parties announced that they would not support him. They have just been joined by the party of the prime minister-in-waiting, Naftali Bennett. These right-wing parties decided to abandon Netanyahu’s bloc for a host of reasons, but the commonly cited reason is their leaders’ intense lack of trust in Netanyahu, their sense that the country has had enough of his long rule, and a consensus that his government is crippled by chronic decision-making difficulties and that it sows ision – and that preventing a 5th election in two years is of paramount importance.If a new government is indeed formed in the next week, it will turn out that Netanyahu was not replaced because of the left, but because of a growing agreement on the right flank of Israeli politics that it’s time for change.Nadav Eyal is a leading Israeli journalist and columnist for the Israeli daily Yediot AhronotMore from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"exclusive 270 charities paying bosses prime minister","story":"More than 270 charities are paying their bosses more than the Prime Minister, with the highest earner on £4.7m a year, an investigation by The  has found.In the most comprehensive analysis ever made public, this newspaper has discovered that between them the organisations employ more than 2,500 staff members on salaries in excess of £100,000 a year.They range from organisations with income of a few hundred thousand pounds a year to huge international groups where the chief executive is managing a budget of more than a billion pounds.Helen Stephenson, chief executive of the Charity Commission, said that organisations need to justify their pay to the public as she is not shy of making further requirements on transparency.Writing in The , she said: All charities should be able to look donors and volunteers in the eye and say how their decisions about pay impacts on the cause they pursue or the people they help.Being a charity is a privilege. And all charities need to know that they ultimately answer to the public – as donors, volunteers, and taxpayers - for that privilege.There have been numerous attempts to force organisations not only to be transparent, but to justify their pay packets to avoid further eroding public trust which has already been rocked by a number of scandals.When it emerged in 2019 that Marie Stopes had paid chief executive Simon Cooke £430,000, including a sizeable bonus which doubled his salary, the Charity Commission offered rare public condemnation and promised to investigate executive pay.But two years later the regulator’s report has been quietly shelved and an investigation by The  has found that Mr Cooke’s bumper pay packet is dwarfed by awards at other organisations. Using data from thousands of registered charities, this newspaper analysed the latest accounts of those paying their highest earner more than Boris Johnson’s salary of £157,372. This puts them in the top one per cent of taxpayers in the country. The rich list includes 35 charities with the highest earner on more than £300,000 a year.The Wellcome Trust had the highest paid employee, with chief investment officer Nick Moakes taking home £4.64million including salary and bonuses last year – a £1.3million rise on the year before.The health research charity, whose director Sir Jeremy Farrar earns £483,788, said that pay is linked to performance and by bringing their investment team in house they have been able to make billions more to fund their work.As part of a wage bill of £105million, the Wellcome Trust paid more than 90 staff over £100,000, with seven employees in the investment team taking home more than £1million. Other charities topping the rich list are less transparent about what they pay and why. The International Institute for Strategic Studies made it into the top six as its biggest earner took home between £600,001 to £610,000 in the year to September 2019, but the relatively small charity refused to confirm whether CEO Dr John Chipman had received the pay packet.This generous remuneration would still not make him the highest paid charity CEO an accolade that instead goes to Steve Gray, who took home around £935,000 for running Nuffield Health in 2019.The Consumer’s Association, the charity behind Which? magazine, has long hit the headlines for paying its previous CEO Peter Vicary-Smith £825,000 in his final year. Despite his successor Anabel Hoult taking a pay cut, she still took home around £395,000 last year from the organisation, which does not receive public funds and has a commercial arm.Household names including Cancer Research, the RNLI, Refuge, Barnardo’s, the NSPCC, Comic Relief and the National Trust are among those that pay top wages.Medical charities, which argue that they need to pay market rates to be at the forefront of research, account for around a fifth of the 278 charities on the rich list.The Thrombosis Research Institute gave a hefty wage to its highest paid staff member of around £415,000 in the year to July 2020, an increase of roughly £50,0000 on the previous year and in the midst of the pandemic. Its income was just £6.9million.Cancer Research, on the other hand, with its income of £656million, paid chief executive Michelle Mitchell £255,600. A similar disparity between the size of the organisation and the levels of pay are seen across the not-for-profit sector.Arts charities, including museums and theatres, also feature heavily on the list. The Royal Opera House came out third from top by paying its music director Sir Antonio Pappano £839,000 in salary, fees for conducting and pension payments, £100,000 more than the previous year. A spokesman said that he had waived his fees and salary this year because of the pandemic, and Alexander Beard, chief executive, had agreed to take a 25 per cent pay cut on his £297,000 salary.The English National Ballet, the South Bank Centre, the National Gallery, the British Museum and the Tate were all among those sending executives home with more than £200,000 in pay and bonuses, annual returns show.The Design Museum, with an income of £13.2million in the year to March 31 2020, gave its highest salary of around £175,000 to one of its former directors at the same time as experiencing a cash crisis because of low visitor numbers. In contrast, the Victoria and Albert Museum – with an income of £117.4million and more than 4 million visitors – paid director Dr Tristram Hunt a salary of around £145,000. However, Dr Hunt’s pay packet was bumped up to around £220,000 when pension contributions and a £20,000 bonus were added.The Design Museum said it has since appointed Tim Marlow as its new director and CEO, who has voluntarily taken a 25 per cent pay cut from April to October and whose salary for the next accounts will fall into the £150,000 to £160,000 pay bracket.Smaller venues also signed off eye-watering wages, with Roger Wright, the director of Britten Pears Arts, which runs two venues on the Suffolk coast, on a higher salary than the boss of the Royal Albert Hall.Similar disparities were seen at Caudwell Children, a charity with an income of £6.4million and just over 200 staff, which gave chief executive Trudi Beswick a £50,000 pay rise to push her salary into the £350,000-360,000 pay range.This is more than double the comparatively modest £143,000 salary of Kevin Watkins, chief executive of Save the Children UK, which has an income of more than £300million and more than 6,000 staff and volunteers.One small charity providing sheltered accommodation was found to have paid its boss more than a quarter of its total £659,000 annual income in the year to March 2020.Other bosses earning huge sums include Hartwig Fischer, Director of the British Museum on around £290,000 Richard Parry, the boss of the Canal and River Trust on £216,209 Dr Charmaine Griffiths from the British Heart Foundation on £189,000 NSPCC’s Peter Wanless on £194,000 in salary and pension and Barnardo’s CEO Javed Khan on £183,000.More than 126 of the highest payers took donations directly from members of the public, according to data on the regulator’s website.Senior industry figures said that those not relying on donations still benefited from billions of pounds in tax breaks, funding from the Government and foundations, and the halo effect of charitable status.Charities argue that they need to pay high wages to attract the best talent, but it is notable that some of the UK’s biggest organisations are absent from the rich list. While not on insignificant salaries, the bosses of Oxfam, BBC Children in Need and the Royal British Legion were not paid more than the Prime Minister.Benchmarking against other companies is also cited as a reason for high pay, but many argue that those in the sector should accept a charity discount.Rob Wilson, the former Minister for Civil Society under both David Cameron and Theresa May, said: The benchmark for most of these public sector charities has been for some time what the Prime Minister earns, and really you have got to have a really significant justification for paying your chief executive more than that.He added: The implications of paying the chief executive too much is that it severely erodes public trust in charities as a whole and is very detrimental to the many thousands of small charities who are working hard on behalf of communities day in, day out, up and down the country.My advice to charities and their trustees is to be very, very careful about their chief executive’s salary. Obviously it is important to pay people what they are worth, but you have to be able to justify it to donors and the public.Mr Wilson also warned that charities risked the stink of hypocrisy if they discussed issues such as poverty whilst paying their chief executive hundreds of thousands of pounds.The Charity Commission has admitted it has abandoned publishing its report on pay which was due out last year.Instead of a one off report, it has made information accessible on its website on how many people at various organisations are paid more than £60,000 in salary bands, a spokesman said. It is also launching a project to further improve the public’s ability to hold charities to account, with charities doing more to explain how they are run, and what difference they are making, the spokesman added.Since 2018 the Commission has required all the organisations it regulates to provide it with details of their highest earners, and this data has led to concerns about management. The commission has no power to set executive pay.The National Council for Voluntary Organisations went further after conducting its own investigation in 2014 and recommended that all charities should publish names and job titles of their highest paid staff. But The  has found that only a small number have taken its advice.Sir Martyn Lewis, who led that investigation in his former role as the head of the NCVO, said that he was disappointed as transparency is central to maintaining public trust.The key is explanation, he told The . So that you have a guarantee that it is not a gravy train and you can show that the trustees of the charity have thought long and hard about what pay is needed.A spokesman for the NCVO said that they understand the concern, but added: It is important to remember that only 9 per cent of charities in the UK employ paid staff and most of those pay modest salaries. Fewer than 1 percent of charities employ a member of staff earning £60,000 or more, and around 80 per cent of charities rely on volunteers to deliver their work.They said that pay – which is set by trustees – is a consistent and key priority for our members and the wider sector and getting it right is important to maintain public trust.Acevo, the charity leaders’ body, said that the average salary among not-for-profit CEOs is £56,000. Decisions about executive pay are made by a board of volunteers who take into account all of these factors, and others like the complexity of the organisation and the need to attract a particular skill set, a spokesman said.Supporters views are incredibly important to charities and if they disagree with a decision about pay, I would encourage them to talk directly to the charity about it.All charities contacted said that decisions on pay followed a rigorous process and are set against market rates to ensure that they can find the best staff for the job. Some executives have agreed to take a pay cut as they cope with the fallout from the pandemic.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"people want evidence charities say","story":"The public’s expectations of charities are, at heart, quite simple. People want to make a difference to the causes they care about. This means that when they donate their hard-earned cash, they want to see a high proportion of the money spent on the end cause, they want to know that charities are being true to their values, and they want charities to show in real terms the difference they are making. In other words, as our published research shows, people want evidence that charities are what they say they are.Pay in charities matters to people because it touches on all these expectations. To many, the issue of pay provides a key to understanding how charities are run, and what motivates those in charge. If charities are unable to explain very high pay packets, then this risks denting public trust, which underpins the support that charities need to help us build back from the pandemic.There is no easy ‘one size fits all’ answer to fair pay in charities. There are 167,000 charities on our register. Some are groups led entirely by volunteers, others are complex organisations requiring skilful and experienced staff and management. Many are somewhere in between.The Charity Commission is not a pay regulator. It is our responsibility to build trust and improve accountability in charities so that donors and volunteers can make informed, confident choices. Whether you’re training for a charity marathon, or organising a bake sale, whether you’re putting a few pounds in a collection tin or signing up to support a charity with regular monthly donations – you should know where your money is going, including how much of it pays for charity wages.Last year, for the first time, we published salary data about every charity on our online register of charities. At a glance, people can now see exactly how many people in each charity earn £60,000 or more a year, in bands of £10k. That’s a really important step towards transparency. But it doesn’t go far enough. I don’t just want charities to tell the public how much they pay their senior people. I want them to get better at explaining why. All charities should be able to look donors and volunteers in the eye and say how their decisions about pay impacts on the cause they pursue or the people they help. How it helps them be a better charity.So this year we are launching a project to further improve the public’s ability to hold charities to account, with charities doing more to explain how they are run, and what difference they are making. We want to widen the public’s window into the soul of a charity. We plan to work with charities, learning from those who already do it well, to make the change we need to see. But I’m not shy of laying down further requirements, including on pay transparency, if we need to.Being a charity is a privilege. And all charities need to know that they ultimately answer to the public – as donors, volunteers, and taxpayers - for that privilege.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"yes black tudors lived fascinating lives","story":"Although Africans were enslaved in Spain, Portugal, Italy and in the Americas at this time, the Tudors – with the infamous exception of John Hawkins, and to a lesser extent Drake – were not for most of the period engaged in trafficking Africans. This was not due to moral considerations, but rather because as the English colonies had not yet been established, there was no demand for English merchants to fulfil.The black population began to grow in England from the 1550s, when the Tudors began trading with Africa – in gold, ivory and pepper, not humans – and capturing Spanish and Portuguese ships as privateers. But even before then, people moved around the world far more than many of us realise.Henry VIII also employed other people of African descent. In 1546, he hired black salvage ers to retrieve guns from the wreck of the Mary Rose. Jacques Francis was an expert swimmer and er and became known as the first African to give evidence in an English court of law when his Venetian employer, Peter Paulo Corsi, was accused of theft.In the Scottish court, there was an African drummer with a wife and child whom the King continued to support after he died. At the court of James IV, an African man called Petir the Moryen (Peter the Moor) was given five French crowns at the King’s request to journey to France.It all changed in the 17th century, as England founded colonies in North America and the Caribbean, which became dependent on enslaved labour trafficked across the Atlantic.

The rise in cases is concerning but is not increasing hospital admissions or deaths.  The NHS reports that “very, very few” patients admitted with the virus are double-jabbed, so the vaccination programme works.

The answer to disgruntled Catholics asking why the twice-orced Prime Minister was allowed to marry for a third time in Westminster Cathedral is that it was his first wedding within the faith. The previous two were not. The more pressing question for most people is whether Johnson paid for his own wedding. If a wealthy friend covered any of the bill, their identity and the amount should be made public, to avoid potential conflicts of interest. That a signicant number of voters even wondered about the cost is a shadow cast by Johnson’s previous unacceptable behaviour.

The British Medical Association, experts and government advisors lined up today to warn ending all restrictions prematurely could lead to an explosion of cases. Dr Lisa Spencer, honorary secretary of the British Thoracic Society, warned iant hotspots are like “volcanoes” that “could explode and send a massive gas plume across much more of the UK”. Advisor to the government Prof Ravi Gupta, a member of SAGE subgroup NERVTAG, today declared the easing should be delayed for “probably a month”.Prof Gupta - who yesterday warned Britain may already be in a third wave - told Sky News: “My personal opinion is I think it’s a bit early.“I think we need at least a few weeks - probably a month until schools have closed, when the risk of transmission within schools falls during summer holidays.  It then gives us another four weeksapos worth of data to collect about how the virus is growing in the population. But fellow NERVTAG member Prof Robert Dingwall told Times Radio: “Itaposs not clear what the value of that would be and the critics canapost even agree on what sort of delay theyaposd like. “Itaposs a couple of weeks, three or four weeks, a couple of months. At the margins, these things make very little dference.” Ministers and officials are locked in talks over the B... strain, first found in India, amid speculation some lockdown rules - like mask-wearing - will have to remain. A Tory minister today refused to sayStep Four of the government’s roadmap - which would lt all legal limits on indoor gatherings and reopen nightclubs - can go ahead as planned on June . Paul Scully told LBC radio: “We do just need to be careful. We need to err on the side of caution. No decisions have been made - we’ll only do that based on the latest and most accurate data.” The government will only confirm any changes on June the Covid response has met four key tests, including that a new iant does not risk a surge in cases. The UK reported , new cases yesterday - the sixth day in a row the figure topped , - and the rolling average has risen from , to , in a week. The rolling average of daily deaths has crept up from . to ., and hospital admissions have also risen in recent weeks. Vaccine second doses are being “surged” to the most vulnerable as officials hope everyone over  can be given a second dose by June . But while the jab appears to reduce the risk of going to hospital with the B... strain it does not totally eliminate it. Prof Gupta warned increased social activity following last monthaposs May  easing of restrictions - which allowed six people to meet indoors - could lead to quite a lot of hospital admissions.  He said while Britain had performed amazingly well in its vaccination programme, it was still too early to put the vaccine straight up against the virus. He told ITV’s Good Morning Britain: We must remember this is a virus that does adapt, and faced with vaccines it will eventually start to make mutations to avoid them even further, and then we could be in an even more precarious situation after that. He added: ”The key thing here is that weaposre almost there. The problem is we donapost want to put the vaccine straight up against the virus at a time when the vaccine coverage isnapost quite high enough itaposs not in young people, itaposs not in schoolchildren, and thataposs where the virus may potentially start circulating. We still have a lot of vulnerable people in the community who havenapost responded to the vaccine.  British Medical Association council chairman Dr Chaand Nagpaul urged the Government to “act with maximum caution when considering whether to go ahead with lting restrictions on June ”. “We cannot afford to repeat past mistakes, which would result in greater levels of serious illness and loss of lives, including adding pressures to our overstretched NHS,” he said. “The Government must hold off making a final decision on whether lockdown is fully lted on June  until latest data can be scientically considered – the Prime Minister had pledged he would be guided by ‘data not dates’, and it’s vital that he now honours this commitment.” He added: “A premature ending of all legal restrictions which then resulted in a surge of infections would undermine our health service’s efforts to tackle the biggest level of backlog of care it has ever faced. It would also add further demands on staff who are exhausted, both mentally and physically.” Royal College of Emergency Medicine vice president Dr Adrian Boyle, warned that Britain faces a “perfect storm of hospitals just not having enough capacity. Easing restrictions could be the sort of thing that actually tips some of these smaller hospitals really into a very disastrous situation, he told Times Radio. Dr Lisa Spencer, honorary secretary of the British Thoracic Society, told the BBC: “There are a few hotspots around the UK. These are areas where the iant first identied in India seem to be causing a majority of the infections, spreading quickly. “These areas of the country represent mini-Covid volcanoes, thataposs the problem. If we donapost handle these volcanoes carefully they could explode and send a massive gas plume across much more of the UK.”FOLLOW USMirrorPoliticsFollow @MirrorPoliticsCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnCoronavirusNHSConservative PartyBBCBritish Medical AssociationBoris JohnsonGood Morning BritainEducationHospitalsSchoolsPoliticsVolcanoes"},{"url":null,"title":"june 21 lockdown end realistic","story":"NewsJune  lockdown end - realistic chances Boris Johnson will change roadmap explainedThe final step to freedom is due to take place within weeks, with all legal limits on social contact ditched.

Your information will be used in accordance with ourPrivacy Notice.Thank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticePlans to lt the final lockdown restrictions on June  have been thrown into doubt by the growing threat of the Indian iant. Boris Johnsonaposs roadmap has so far gone as planned, with the first three stages taking place on the promised dates in March, April and May. But Step  - which will come no earlier than June  - could be derailed by the spread of the new strain in parts of the country, with some experts calling for the final easing of restrictions to be pushed back. The Government insists it is just too early to say, as officials pore over Covid data to seethe battle between the vaccine and the virus is being won. And evenit does go ahead as billed, some social distancing restrictions could still be in place for longer.  The public has learned from bitter experience how quickly things can change, so all eyes will be on the data in the coming weeks. Hereaposs what we know about the plan to lt the last lockdown restrictions - and whether it will go ahead. What rules are due to change on June   Mr Johnson set out a four-step roadmap out of lockdown back in February, with a phasedto normal le. Most restrictions have now lted, such as the ban on foreign holidays and overnight stays, and pubs, restaurants, retail, galleries and and cinemas have been able to reopen. In Step , the Government aimed to remove all legal limits on social contact, which means any number of people can meet up both indoors and outside. This means you can legally have any people as you want over to your house for dinner or for a picnic in the garden. It also means shuttered venues like nightclubs can reopen, as more people are allowed inside together, and crowds couldto big events like festivals and gigs. Pilots have been taking place to test how big events can . Crowds attended the Brit awards earlier this month, while clubbers ed to the dance floor for trial events in Liverpool at the start of May. It will also factor in whether big weddings can take place, as the current rules allow no more than  guests. Separate reviews are also underway into use of vaccine passports for events and whether social distancing measures can be ditched. Some measures such as face coverings could stay in place for longer as reports suggest the Government may prioritise scrapping the aposone-metre plusapos rule to allow businesses to serve more customers.  How will the Government decide whether to unlock on June   Officials are poring over the data to see whether it is safe to ease restrictions further. Under the roadmap, four key tests must be met before the next step can go ahead. They are:That the vaccine deployment programme continues successfully That evidence shows jabs are sufficiently effective in reducing hospitalisations and deaths in those vaccinated That infection rates do not risk a surge in hospitalisations which puts unsustainable pressure on the NHS That the Government’s assessment of the risks is not fundamentally changed by new iants of concernThe final test about new iants is the critical one here - and whether the Government decides the risk from the Indian strain is too great to move forward. The PM is expected to announce his decision on June , to give businesses a week to prepare.  How much of a threat is the Indian iant  The new strain of the virus has been causing alarm because it is thought to be spreading more quickly than previous iants. The PM is waiting for key data on its transmissibility before he makes the final decision about June . The Governmentaposs advisers recently suggested it could be up to % more infectious, but other analyses have offered lower figures. It is now the dominant strain in the UK, taking over from the Kent iant which ripped across the country in the winter. Cases and deaths have risen in the UK over the past week, linked to the new spread of the iant.Between May  and  there were  deaths reported within  days of a positive coronavirus test, an increase of .% compared with the previous seven days. There were a further , lab-confirmed cases on Sunday, with the number of cases between May  and May  - , - .% higher than the previous seven days. But the success of the vaccine rollout means the country is in a much better place to see off the virus - as long as the jabs work against it. A recent study by Public Health England found the Pfizer jab was % effective against the Indian iant after two doses, while AstraZeneca was % effective. However both were only % effective against the Indian iant three weeks after the first dose. More than  million people have been given a first jab and a further . million have had both doses. The Government has accelerated the vaccine rollout to try to get as many people fully jabbed as possible. All over-s are set to have had both doses by that date under a target set out by vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi. But many younger people are still waiting to be called up for their first dose - and there are still examples of vaccine hesitancy. What do the experts say about June   A growing number of scientists have been calling for the final stage to be delayed to give more time to see whether hospitalisations from the new iant are going up. Professor Ravi Gupta, a member of the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group , said that with the UK in the grip of an early third wave -and urged ministers to push back June  by a few weeks. He said the country was not too far from reaching the sort of levels of vaccination that would help us contain the virus, echoing calls from other experts to wait until more people have had both jabs.  Professor Adam Finn, a member of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, said there had been some encouraging data but the impact of the easing of restrictions in May would not be known until around about June  or just before that. NHS Providers boss Chris Hopson said hospitals are busy with the backlog of non-Covid cases - and even a small uptick in cases could have a big impact. He told Times Radio: The concerns are that this is a much more transmissible iant. Weaposve still got lots of people still to vaccinate. And absolutely hospitals are very busy. Weaposre talking to people who are saying aposWeaposve got -% bed occupancy, this is not the kind of bed occupancy we would normally expect at this time of yearapos. What does the Government say  The tone from the Government has become more muted in recent days, despite pressure on Mr Johnson to stick to the June  date. Tory MPs have been pressing the PM to lt restrictions to help struggling businesses and give people back their freedoms. And Mr Johnson will be keen to stick to his promise after so many u-turns and last minute decisions last year. The Prime Minister warned on Thursday that we may need to wait for more information but said I donapost see anything currently in the data to ert from the June  date. Health Secretary Matt Hancock told MPs it was too early to tell whether England can take the final step to freedom.  On Monday, Environment Secretary George Eustice also said we canapost rule anything out when asked about whether the date should be delayed.

Proposals have been drawn up to demand pupils are kept at school for another two and a half hours each week, The Times reports. The proposal suggests that each child will have to have an additional  hours of schooling per year from  after the disruption caused by Covid, with extra tutoring for five million pupils and additional training for , teachers. The Mirror understands the final proposals by aposcatch-up tsarapos Sir Kevan Collins are due to be published within days. Previously it was reported that ministers would consider extending the school day in an effort to catch up with lost learning during the pandemic. School Standards minister Nick Gibb said earlier this year it was one of the proposals being looked at by Sir Kevan.  Mr Gibb told the Commons education committee at the time: Iaposm open to all ideas, we just have to leave no stone unturned in making sure that we can help those young people catch up from the lost education. Now, according to The Times, a leaked presentation written by Sir Kevan says children will face a -hour week minimum. And officials are reportedly considering an additional year of college for sixth-form studentsteenagers canapost finish their A-levels in time. The Times reports that the -page document was apos per cent completeapos as of April , and a Whitehall source was claimed to have said nothing had changed drastically since then. Government sources have not denied the plans when approached by the Mirror. Boris Johnson is already said to have been briefed on the report and is prepared to give the go ahead, insiders claimed. If the document stays unchanged, the recommendation is said to be for extra time, as well as teaching and tutoring, and that teachers will be given raises to cover the extra hours. A Department for Education spokesperson said: “The government is committed to education recovery in response to the pandemic and is spending £.bn by the end of  on catch-up activity alone. We have appointed Sir Kevan Collins as Education Recovery Commissioner to advise on this work and will share further details in due course. Unions previously reacted to the plans with a fresh warning for teachers, who are already working long hours with high workloads. Kevin Courtney, Joint General Secretary of the National Education Union, warned ministers against piling fresh pressure on teachers.  “Any proposals to change term times or holidays will need to consider that teachers already work more unpaid overtime than any other profession, and that excessive workload is the reason that many teachers and school leaders leave teaching,” he said. Schools had been physically closed during the national lockdown but re-opened to pupils earlier this year. As part of the easing of lockdown restrictions from May  face coverings for pupils are no longer recommended in secondary schools or colleges - either in classrooms or communal areas. Face masks couldin some schoolsthere are local outbreaks, and twice weekly home testing for school pupils remain in place to control infection rates.FOLLOW USMirrorPoliticsFollow @MirrorPoliticsCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnEducationSchools"},{"url":null,"title":"thousands brit expats four countries","story":":root Thousands of Brit expats in four countries only have  days to keep residence rightsUp to , Brits in France had not yet applied for residence status by the end of April - despite a deadline looming on June Thousands of Brit expats in four countries only have  days to keep residence rightsUp to , Brits in France had not yet applied for residence status by the end of April - despite a deadline looming on June People on the beach in Marseille, France - one of four countries where Brits face a looming deadlineImage: AFP Getty ImagesByDan BloomOnline Political Editor:,  Jun Thousands of British expats in four EU countries have been warned they could lose their residency rightsthey don’t apply before a deadline in  days’ time.UK nationals who live in France, Malta, Latvia and Luxembourg have until June  to apply for a new residence status after Brexit.But an estimated , in France alone have not yet done so, according to a report produced at the end of April by a UK EU joint committee.

Experts working with the World Health Organisationdeveloped the labels for iants which are often colloquially named after the places where they are first detected. Many iants of Sars-CoV- - the virus that causes Covid- - have been identied around the world. They include B..., known in the UK as the Kent iant and around the world as the UK iant - but now labelled by the WHO as Alpha. The B... iant, often known as the Indian iant, has been labelled Delta, while B.., often referred to as the South African iant, has been named Beta. Tory minister Paul Scully said the UK government is likely to start using the newly-recommended names.  He told LBC: “The thing about the names is it’s where they were first identied, but it doesn’t mean it comes from that area. “And I don’t think it matters either way frankly, but I think we will be calling it Alpha, which is the Kent iant, and Delta as you say which is the iation that started in India.” Askedthe government would officially change its naming policy he replied: “That’s not my decision but I suspect that will be the case.” With so much changing so quickly, keep on top of what is happening with the Mirroraposs news updates by email.

The WHO said: While they have their advantages, these scientic names can be dficult to say and recall, and are prone to misreporting. As a result, people often resort to calling iants by the places where they are detected, which is stigmatising and discriminatory. To avoid this and to simply public communications, WHO encourages national authorities, media outlets and others to adopt these new labels. Health officials hope the new names which are easy to say and remember will help public discussion, Sky News reports. The P. Brazilian iant will now become Gamma, under the new naming system. The WHO said these labels were chosen after wide consultation and a review of many naming systems. The organisation said the labels do not replace existing scientic names, which convey important scientic information and will continue to be used in research.FOLLOW USMirrorPoliticsFollow @MirrorPoliticsCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnCoronavirusMutant Coronavirus"},{"url":null,"title":"baby becomes first uk 18m","story":"NewsBaby becomes first in UK to have £.m per dose NHS drug to save his leArthur Morgan offers hope to hundreds of poorly children in the fight against genetic disease as a £.million-per-dose drug gives the five-month-old tot the chance of lemirrorShareCommentsByMartin BagotHealth and Science editor:,  JUN Updated:,  JUN NewsThere is hope now for baby Arthur \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

An employment tribunal in Watford heard that the unwanted advances left his victim, referred to as Ms X, feeling uncomfortable and trapped. Hughes liked her holiday photos on Facebook wearing a bikini and also wrote nice bikini shots - I will have to download them to my personal collection, a tribunal heard. Ms X said that he then told her the photos could make a man sweat and made him hot under the collar. And when he openly declared his attraction to her, she said she felt weird and awkward and made up an excuse to leave to get away from him. The tribunal in Watford heard that Hughes joined Staines-based CALA Homes as Senior Technical Manager in May .  The hearing was told that at first the two colleagues exchanged mildly flirtatious messages but by the summer of , Hughes had started making inappropriate comments.He continued to do so until December of that year when Ms X complained to her manager. The tribunal heard that Hughes also told a female colleague that he got excited whenever he met her and that he would be smilinghe were to sit next to her. Another inappropriate comment from Hughes came after Ms X emailed him with a work matter and she mentioned that she had bumped into Tony Hadley from the s band Spandau Ballet. The tribunal heard that Hughes responded to this email saying: Tony Hadley nice name drop there, I am surprised Tony didnapost pop something when he met you on the weekend. The tribunal heard that Hughes pestered Ms X about not calling him and would call the office to ask where she was and who she was with in attempts to get her on her own. Hughes defended his actions saying he was trying to compliment Ms X with the bikini comment he made in .  And Hughes even said that he was trying to give Ms X a confidence boost, as she had just been through a orce, when he made the comment about smiling around her. Ms X said that Hughesapos comments seemed flippant and fine at first but that over time they had begun to make her feel uncomfortable. She added that after he told her he fancied her, she felt trapped and had physically recoiled from him. Her complaints about his behaviour led to him being fired in March . Hughes denied saying he fancied Ms X and brought claims of unfair dismissal and wrongful dismissal to the tribunal. He claimed Ms X should have made it clear she was uncomfortable and that he was upset he had been described as a sex pest. But Judge Anna Reindorf dismissed both Hughesapos claims of unfair and wrongful dismissal. She said:pursued Ms X by email and in person. This amounted to sexual harassment because it was part of a course of conduct which had begun with smutty emails and continued with sexual advances. Judge Reindorf also ruled that Hughesapos claim that he was referring to popping a champagne bottle when he made the Tony Hadley comment entirely lacked credibility. She said: It is quite obvious that the comment was intended to amount to sexual innuendo.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorMore OnTribunals"},{"url":null,"title":"britains dullest man spends 10","story":"NewsBritains dullest man spends  years photographing over  prisons across UKKevin Beresford, , is hoping to flog calendars of his photographs of prisons to inmates but has refused to include Bank Holidays as he says he doesnt want to hurt their feelingsmirrorShareCommentsByDilantha DissanayakeSam Elliott-Gibbs:,  JUN Updated:,  JUN NewsKevin Beresford is hoping inmates will buy his  calendars \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

If they are then they would join  other countries which have stringent rules dictating how people get into the UK. Mr Boyle made his prediction ahead of a government review into the traffic light system, which will likely make holidays to some hotspots easier and trips to others much more dficult. The analyst used global coronavirus case and testing rate data to plot a graph of countries and their travel status. Do you think the government should add more countries to the green list or proceed with caution  Tell us in the comments below  Bahrain, Costa Rica, Trinidad and Tobago and Kuwait - which are all currently amber - have rates closer to or above other red list countries. Those flying into the UK from such destinations have to spend ten days in a quarantine hotel. Mr Boyle also noted the countries classied as amber that have rates similar to green list countries. There are three additional countries that seem like clear cases for getting onto the green list - Malta, Finland and Slovakia, he told The Sun. He added: There are seven other countries that could be classied greenthe EU threshold for case rates is used. Five of these are in the EU: Austria, Czechia, Germany, Italy and Luxembourg.  Mr Boyle said Russia makes the grade but would likely not be added for political reasons, while the US is on the EUaposs case rate threshold. Although the government has not announced when the travel list will be updated, it is expected in the next week There are currently  countries on the green list, all of which have low coronavirus rates and high levels of vaccine distribution. They are Ascension Island, Australia, Brunei, the Falkland Islands, the Faroe Islands, Gibraltar, Iceland, Israel, New Zealand, Portugal, Tristan da Cunha, St Helena, Singapore, South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands.  The government is being pushed from two dferent sides when it comes to the decision as to whether to ease travel between more countries. On the one hand, some scientists including Prof Ravi Gupta, from the University of Cambridge, have warned that the UK is now at the beginning of a third wave of infections and should generally proceed with caution. Others, such as Ryanair’s Michael O’Leary, are pushing for travel restrictions to be eased in a bid to boost the sector.  “The highly successful UK vaccine rollout has already enabled hundreds and thousands of British families to book their flights to Portugal this summer, and today we call on Minister Grant Shapps to include all EU countries in the next revision of the UK’s green list so UK holidaymakers can travel restriction-free to the beaches of Spain, Greece and Italy – all of whom have opened their doors to British visitors this summer, he said on Tuesday, He added: There is no justication for the UK Govt to delay the removal of all travel restrictions for those who have been fully vaccinated when research from Public Health England has demonstrated that two doses of the C- vaccines are highly effective against the Indian iant.

Christina Rack, , a volunteer for local charities, left her cul-de-sac home in Chorlton, Manchester, at .pm on October  in .Her family have described her as a “chatty, personable, and funny” person who went for walks with their West Yorkshire terrier Mable bird-watching, according to the Manchester Evening News.But on that day Mable was already being walked by Christina’s brother Jacob, . After she had been missing for nine days, her family – including sister Elizabeth and parents Henry and Judith - went to the local press to appeal for help. Another brother, Martin, said: There was nothing to suspect that she was going to disappear. There was no issue, no argument within the family which had come to a head.  “She had mental health issues and had been on medication and there was some indication the week before that she was getting a bit anxious.” Christina suffered from mental health issues and had disappeared for half a day once before. The last person to see her was her daughter, Lola, then . Her mobile phone had stopped working an hour and a half after she left home, and was later found in Sale Water Park.  Police enlisted the help of the Bolton Mountain Rescue Team and the GMP Underwater Search Team, Tactical Aid Unit, and neighbourhood officers in a search for Christina, but found no trace. They also released CCTV footage of the area where Christina was thought to have gone missing. The image included a car, which was thought to be signicant, but the lead went nowhere. It would be another two and a half years before her family got the terrible news. Dog walkers found a body in the Chorlton Ees nature reserve area close to the River Mersey around noon on Tuesday, April  of this year. The body has now been identied as Christina.  DI Chris Maddocks, of GMPaposs City of Manchester South district, said their team searched “extensively” in the area back in , including with “an underwater search team, a helicopter, drone, specialist search dogs and officers on the ground”. He said it was possible changes in the water level meant her body had moved. Christinaaposs mother Judith Rack said: Weaposd like to thank the police for their extensive search and their support since , and the public for their help. “We are a private family and would now like time to grieve. We still miss Christina terribly and always will. Police continue to investigate the circumstances around Christinaaposs death.

Latest data shows Rossendale, Ribble Valley and Hyndburn - all parts of Lancashire - are among those areas now recording some of the highest rates in the UK. Blackburn with Darwen, also in Lancashire, remains the area with the highest rate in the country, while parts of Greater Manchester have seen sharp rises.It comes as experts voice doubts over whether coronavirus restrictions can be lted on June , due to the highly-transmissible Indian iant.New research shows this has become the dominant strain in many parts of the UK, accounting for more than  per cent of cases in Bolton and Blackburn. Boris Johnson is weighing up whether to plough ahead with unlocking England, with cases up  per cent in a week and hospitalisations rising by  per cent week-on-week.Bury, Manchester and Salford, are recording a sharp rise in people testing positive.  Latest figures show , people have tested positive in the past seven days across the UK - , higher than the previous week. A further  people have died from Covid in that time, while  people have been admitted to hospital. But cases remain far lower than during the second peak, with more than , cases confirmed on one day alone, four days after Christmas.

Analysis by the PA news agency shows that:Scotland has the highest rate of new cases of the four nations of the UK, though rates for Wales and Northern Ireland are still dropping Kirklees in West Yorkshire has one of the highest rates outside north-west England, but the rest of the region has yet to record similar levels Other areas of the country where rates have jumped sharply include Reigate  Banstead in Surrey, Watford in Hertfordshire and Slough in Berkshire While a majority of local areas across the UKhave seen a week-on-week rise, most increases are slight and at a very low levelScientists are queueing up to plead with Boris Johnson to delay the planned end of lockdown on June .The British Medical Association, experts and government advisors lined up today to warn ending all restrictions prematurely could lead to an explosion of cases. Dr Lisa Spencer, honorary secretary of the British Thoracic Society, warned iant hotspots are like “volcanoes” that “could explode and send a massive gas plume across much more of the UK”. Advisor to the government Prof Ravi Gupta, a member of SAGE subgroup NERVTAG, today declared the easing should be delayed for “probably a month”.Prof Gupta - who yesterday warned Britain may already be in a third wave - told Sky News: “My personal opinion is I think it’s a bit early.“I think we need at least a few weeks - probably a month until schools have closed, when the risk of transmission within schools falls during summer holidays.

But there are many myths and  information around speed cameras that many have always believed to be true. These range from the idea that most speed cameras arenapost actually switched on to what speed triggers the camera flash. The myths are so pervasive and there are so many that most people will have heard and believed at least one. What is for certain is that speed cameras save lives. Speed is the number one risk factor in the majority of road traffic injuries.To clear up the myths around these vital road safety tools, the charity Brake released information around speed cameras to clear up misconceptions, Stoke-on-Trent Live reports.So letaposs fact-check the top  myths and beliefs about speed cameras.  . Not all speed cameras work. Some are switched off TRUE A spokesman for Brake said: Various Freedom of Information requests have revealed that some speed cameras are not fully operational in the UK. Brake fully supports the use of speed cameras, and would encourage theto use of any cameras that have been turned off. Speed cameras are proven to reduce speeding, and can catch far higher numbers of speeding drivers than traffic police with mobile cameras.  . You have to be speeding at least  per cent over the limit plus mph to get caught FALSE The law states that a driver can receive a speeding ticket as soon as they exceed the speed limit on a road, eventhat is only by mph. However, guidance provided by the NPCC , suggests that officers do not seek to prosecute a driver until they have exceeded the speed limit by  per cent plus mph. . If you drive really quickly, you wonapost trigger the camera FALSE This is completely wrong. The only way to avoid triggering the camera is to stick within the speed limit. . Speed cameras must be painted yellow to be legal FALSE The Government wants all speed cameras in England painted yellow. Butyouaposre caught on a grey one before that happens, tough - the offence still counts.  . Average speed cameras donapost really work and thataposs why some people ignore them FALSE The spokesman for Brake said: Average speed cameras are an effective way to prevent dangerous driver behaviour. They are particularly beneficial as they enforce limits over a longer stretch of road, preventing law-breaking drivers from being able to speed up again immediately after passing a camera. . You must be notied within a certain amount of time for it to be valid TRUE Brake said a driver caught by a speed camera, rather than a police officer, must be sent a Notice of Intended Prosecutionwithin  days.

The group set up on Kew Green on Thursday and have reportedly rejected officials who asked them to move on. The local authority is now having to take legal action to remove the community, a statement said. Pictures taken on Monday show men, women and children continuing to enjoy the sun - despite the threat of impending eviction. A total of  caravans and associated vehicles are said to have arrived last week. Richmond Council confirmed on Friday it would begin the legal process to obtain and enforce a Possession Order after its requests for the travellers to move on were rejected.Got a story  Email webnews@mirror. But the council has been forced to warns locals that the process could take a number of days due to a recent High Court order. Handed down last month, this denied the authorityaposs request to extend the previous expedited injunction process. Instead, the council is now being forced to go via the courts to remove the group. Councillor Julia Neden-Watts said: A small group of travellers has arrived in Kew.  Council officers will commence the legal action required to expedite their departure. Due to a recent court ruling, this process will not be as fast as residents would like and I know that they will be concerned, but we have to work within the law. As soon as the travellers leave, we will inspect the area and ensure that any damage is repaired, and waste removed. Our park guard officers, along with the police, will be monitoring the site closely until the group depart.  The politan Police said on Sunday that local officers had carried out patrols after the council had served the legal notice.A post on Twitter said: We have conducted further patrols around #KewGreen today and are aware @LBRUT have served notices of seeking possession.We will continue to work with Richmond Council over the coming days on this matter. A social media user also alleged that some of the travellers had been using a local alley as a toilet, which the force said it would keep an eye on. The commented added: Itaposs very upsetting. Kew is located around seven miles south-west from Charing Cross, the notional centre of London. It boasts the world famous Royal Botanical Gardens and is seen as a desirable place to live.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorMore OnPolice"},{"url":null,"title":"uk weather heatwave could peak","story":"NewsUK weather: Heatwave could peak today at C before rain hits and temperatures plummetForecasters are warning about worrying weather fronts moving in across the UK, hampering the long-awaited heatwave as temperatures soared to the hottest of the year yesterdaymirrorShareCommentsByRyan MerrieldReporter:,  JUN Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video met-office-uk-forecasts-sunshine-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:DyciARM,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

And while today - the first day of meteorological summer - could see things get even hotter, forecasters are warning the good weather may not last much longer. BBC meteorologist Louise Lear said there is a lot of uncertainty with the potential for rain as early as tomorrow before temperatures take a e. She said: Tuesday may well be the peak of the heat, with some weather fronts threatening from the south-east on Wednesday.How did you enjoy the Bank Holiday sunshine  Let us know at webnews@mirrorA lot of uncertainty when those fronts will arrive and how much rain they will bring. Things will dip down to high-teens after that rain clears. In the meantime, todayaposs glorious sunshine and C heat is set to beat holiday favourite the Algarve, with the warmest temperatures expected in the Midlands, western England, north and west Wales and western Scotland. A maximum temperature of .C was recorded at Kinlochewe in the Scottish Highlands yesterday as Brits took full advantage of newly restored freedoms following the latest lting of lockdown restrictions. Faro in Portugal is expected to see just C, St Tropez in France C and Rome C, in comparison. The previous UK record for the year came on March  when Kew Gardens in west London recorded .C. And despite the potential for bleak weather fronts, some forecasters predict Wednesday could actually get even higher with C.  Met Office forecaster Marco Petagna said: Lots of fine, sunny weather around -anything, temperatures up a degree or so on Monday.While agreeing unsettled conditions are in the offing in the days to come, initially feeding north and eastwards across England, Wales and Northern Ireland, he said C is possible tomorrow in the Midlands and East Anglia. But by Thursday and Friday there is continued risk of thundery showers across the east and south-east of England, with next weekend feeling much milder. There will be a bit more cloud around to end the week, with temperatures coming back down to average, the high teens for most, Mr Petagna said. Despite the fine weather over the weekend, multiple local authorities warned people about gatherings amid fears a full relaxation of lockdown rules, currently penciled in for June , could be delayed due to the spread of the Indian iant.Steven Keates, a Met Office spokesman, told the Daily Mail: It was the warmest day of the year and the warmest day of spring, on the last day of the meteorological spring.

The video she was sent had no audio, but when she ed home she reviewed the full clip to work out why the driver had fled so quickly after the aposweirdapos incident in Delaware, US. And she quickly learned her young son had been behind it, having sneaked a very unique set of delivery instructions onto the Amazon order.  Before the order went out for delivery, under a box titled aposDo we need any additional instructions to find this address apos, her son had written: No but knock on the door  times and scream abra cadabra as loud as you can and run super fast away. Incredibly, the clip shows the woman place the package on the porch before banging on the door and screaming the magical phrase before jumping down the steps and sprinting back to her van - exactly as instructed.Itaposs had more than two million views and , shares after Lynn posed it on Facebook, along with a screenshot of her sonaposs instructions, with the caption: Thank you to this great Amazon delivery woman! Apparently, my youngest son had put some aposadditional instructionsapos for delivery and she went along with it. It made us smile even though my son should not have done that so I apologize for that.I do appreciate that the driver looked closely enough at the instructions though because I know a lot of people wouldnapost. Thousands of people praised the driver for her full commitment to the job, with many suggesting she had earned a raise and promotion. One said: Magnicent!! Everyone has been so grumpy over the last few months and this young ladybrightened all of our lives!! Thank you so much for sharing this!! Another wrote: Hilarious!

Before adding: What is it   The video quickly racked up more than , likes and , comments from Brits who all made reference to the cheap drinks and food and how the toilets are  miles away. One person said: Itaposs like Maccies but they sell cheap alcohol and the toilets are in another country. Another person wrote: Itaposs the second stage of a night out. st stage is pre-drinks at home, nd stage spoons warm up, [rd] stage - out. A third viewer alluded to the occasionally sticky floors: Itaposs a bit like having Velcro on your shoes and they have a base cape and team of Sherpas for when you need the loo.  Cheap drinks in every single one no matter location. No music. Ages - and + attend. Must perform a heist before using the toilet,” wrote another commenter.In a follow-up video, Claire asked people to explain what the deal is with the restrooms, to which someone explained: They usually put them in the basement down about five sets of stairs, a nightmare in heels and when you drink.Someone  then joked: I had a friend who got lost on the way to the toilets.

But, for those who are afraid of flying, it can be a completely dferent experience, questioning and catastrophising over everything that could possibly go wrong. Fortunately, though, one flight attendant has alleviated one potential nightmare, by explaining a secret aviation rule which exists purely to keep passengers safe. Every flight crew is made up of two pilots - a captain and his first officer - but it turns out that while crew also get to enjoy a mid-flight meal on their sht, the two pilots are not allowed to order the same meal as one another. Did you know the captain and first officer are not allowed to eat the same meal on a flight  Emirates flight attendant Dani asked on TikTok.This is to ensure thatthe meal is contaminated, and the captain or first officer gets sick after eating it, then the flight deck who had a dferent meal should still be okay and able to operate the aircraft. Yep, it might sound pedantic, but the rule, which dates back to the very early days of commercial aviation, means that a bout of food poisoning or sickness should never get in the way of a safe flight. Imagine them sitting and arguing over who gets chicken and who gets pasta, one TikTok user joked. Meanwhile, another flight attendant pointed out in the comments that this rule no longer applies to all airlines, however they claimed it is still the case with a number of major airlines, such as Emirates and British Airways.Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

As he moved closer to the yacht, a two-metre shark came into view and glided away before several more sharks can be seen starting to close in. All the while, Mohammad was also tackling the strong current in the sea to get back to the boat. He then reached the yacht and fellow crew members helped the exhausted man out of the water just in time.  The footage was captured by Jalil Najafov, , a filmmaker from Azerbaijan, who was in the Males on the luxury yacht, Azaleo Cruise, on April , when it happened. The video was later shared on Instagram, where it has been viewed over , times – as social media users hailed Mohammad for his remarkable effort to save he bird. Hero, wrote someone on Instagram and another similarly commented heroes. Amazing video, wrote another.  Wow, he’s so brave, added a third person, while other comments included thank you for saving the bird, and love this. Filmmaker Jalil said he went to get his camera when he saw Mohammad jumping in the water. “This is a finch bird, her winglet was damaged and she lives onboard in the bushes,” said Jalil, who is also a conservationist.  “She jumped out of the bushes and then found herself in the water – the yacht crew noticed that and Mohammad jumped into the water to save the bird. “At that moment I went from my cabin and saw what happened and started to film it. “I had injured my leg and I was wearing a bandage, so I couldnapost enter the water, otherwise, as a sign of solidarity, I would have tried to help him somehow – but it was clear that he felt good, despite the strong current and swimming with one hand.”  “There were about  nurse sharks around the boat at the time but on the video, we can only see a few. “I never spoke to Mohammad about sharks but I think he was ok with them since he is a Malian guy and they meet sharks everywhere.” The zebra finch was placed back into the bush on the yacht where it now lives after the remarkable rescue. Jalil added: “The bird would have died in the oceanwe hadn’t saved her.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore

appointed James,” said Nelms.“We knew there was going to be a term of development.“We knew we had to be patient and going into it, that’s what we were going to do.“We committed to that. It is too easy to just chop and change and go to the next one but I watched James behind the scenes and I knew what he was doing.“I knew how much it hurt him and how much he was working to get it right.“We were seeing progress even during the times when we may have drawn a game.“You saw progress, you saw a team slowly starting to come together.“We knew we were going to get grief. We knew that James was going to get grief # how does he handle that and how are we going to help him get through that “We did get grief # ‘Why are you still sticking with him ’.“But we don’t now think of that as vindication, that’s our job and that’s what we do.“Like I said before, with all of the hurdles that were put in our path, not just James but everybody, that’s what made the final whistle last Monday so emotional.”Dundee saw off Kilmarnock comfortably in the Premiership play-off and now have trips to Rangers, Celtic as well as top-flight derbies for the first time in five years.Nelms has revealed a change in tack from manager McPake that saw the Dark Blues put their late run together.After a disappointing - home defeat to Ayr United at Dens, McPake’s men responded with a - victory over Alloa.From there they powered up the Championship table, finished in second place before crowning the season with play-off success.Nelms said: “James progressed all the way through. You saw it a little bit before last season was curtailed.“We had the same type of cadence this year where we were trying to find our feet, find a way to play and it actually came down to where he just went, ‘Look, we have to play reality football. We have to win the high balls, the second balls, work for each other and at the end of the day, our qualities will shine through’.“I think in the last  or  games and especially through the play-offs, that’s what you saw.“That’s why we were successful but, yes, James and his staff absolutely progressed over time.“People don’t like to be patient in football but we were patient with James.“We saw what he was doing behind the scenes. If he perceived there was a mistake, he would own it, correct it or do what he could to correct it.“But his work ethic, the way he treats the players, his staff and his single-mindedness to be successful for Dundee Football Club will make James very successful for a long time in this industry.”Dundee#s Jordan McGhee: We#re ready to take on the Premiership right now\" title\"#Dundee#s Jordan McGhee: We#re ready to take on the Premiership right now# # The Courier\" src\"https:www.thecourier fp sport football dundee-fc  dundees-jordan-mcghee-were-ready-to-take-on-the-premiership-right-now embed # secretVCMLdnPbe\" data-secret\"VCMLdnPbe\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest"},{"url":null,"title":"hamilton-grammar-schools-tribute-pupil-brandon-rice","story":"THE headteacher of a pupil who collapsed at home and later died has paid touching tribute to the ldquocharismatic teenager."},{"url":null,"title":"skyes-limit-sabhal-mor-ostaig---unique-gaelic-only-college-set-stunning-island-location","story":"AS global interest in Gaelic grows, students from across the world are travelling to Skye to study at Sabhal Mograver Ostaig, the National Centre for Gaelic Language and Culture."},{"url":null,"title":"new-bbc-documentary-series-jamie-genevieve-great-indoors-air-week","story":"SOCIAL media star Jamie Genevieve will feature in a new documentary series this week."},{"url":null,"title":"list-glasgow-shops-administration-lockdown","story":"GLASGOWS prominent shopping streets will look very dferent post lockdown with many major retailers calling in the administrators."},{"url":null,"title":"grew-glasgow-a-boulder-blasting-came-window--gorbals-memories","story":"Earliest memory of Glasgow  I was born in .

implemented on television and online junk food advertisements across the UK in a bid to tackle obesity, Karla Sinclair weighs out the pros and cons of another potential change # mandatory calorie counts on menus.Part of the Queen#s Speech, held last month when she officially reopened parliament, was dedicated to fighting weight gain and promoting the health and wellbeing of the country.New measures set to be brought in include banning television adverts that promote unhealthy foods before pm and restricting promotions for junk food that have high fat, salt and sugar content in retailers from April next year.Not only that, another controversial move being implemented in the future involves restaurants, pubs and cafes having to include calorie counts for the food they serve on their menus.But what exactly do figures in the Scottish food and drink scene think of this Healthy food cafe, The Key, which is situated on Regent Quay in Aberdeen and has recently opened a premises in Westhill, Aberdeenshire, has displayed nutritional information on its menus since its inception in July .Managing director of the cafe, Jonny Smith, a former professional footballer, has always wanted to ensure The Key #makes healthier food easy to access#.#I think people are getting more aware of what they are eating and paying closer attention to calories and more importantly macros,# Jonny added.#I personally think this is great as it is something that I have done for a long time, and it is a great education tool for simple things like rough portion sizes when cooking at home and how much food you actually need toon a day-to-day basis.#At The Key, we promote healthy macro-balanced meals but we do not reduce the flavour. I think it is important that people who don’t necessarily care about their macros can come into The Key and have good, tasty food and not know that we have worked hard to reduce the calories.#Whilst I think it is important for people to be aware of what they are eating, I think that making food enjoyable and tasty is the only way to make eating healthier sustainable.And Jonny sayspeople are made aware, or more understanding of what they are eating, then more people will be inclined to eat healthier, providing the information about each dish is easy to consume.He added: #The main benefits to me are just making people aware of what they are eating. There are so many diets and misleading information, so I think having simple and clear information is really important and then people can use this however they want to.#Our goal and slogan is #unlocking a healthier lestyle# and I think having easily accessible information gives customers the tools they need to make decisions on what they eat.#We have had great initial feedback and sales for our prep meals for both adults and kids, which shows me that family health and nutrition is becoming much bigger and people are more aware of the importance of healthy food for children.I thinkpeople aren’t really bothered about this information, they don’t read it.#Jonny Smith of The Key#We don’t go over the top with nutritional information. We are aware that not everyone is really interested in this, but for the people that are, it is a great tool for keeping on track with any diets, food plans etc.#But the more the word spreads about healthier eating, the more people will just come in to eat any of our meals and know that it isn’t going to be a heavy high-calorie meal.#The number of proteins, fats and carbohydrates in an item are stated on the menus at The Key.Jonny believes that more venues should be introducing this information as it benefits customers.He said: #I thinkpeople aren’t really bothered about this information, they don’t read it, but for the people who do care, it is great to know.#Fitness, health and overall wellness are so important and people are more aware of this now, so I think it is important people know what they are eating.#Everyone is entitled to their opinion and I don’t think there is a right or wrong answer on this subject but for people who want this information, I personally think they should be given it.#I actually think it would encourage people who are on eating plans or diets to eat out more and make it easier for them.#Mental health is equally as important as physical health, eating out and socialising are so important for both. Having this information readily available could make this easier for some customers.#Following in The Key#s footsteps is certainly something fellow Aberdeen cafe owner Nicholas Robertson would consider. However, says adding calorie counts to menus may come with challenges.Nicholas, who runs The Tasty Thistle with his partner Sarah Smith, said: #I feel that this could benefit people who have specic nutritional goals, whether they#re aiming to lose weight, build muscle, eat for endurance or just follow a stricter diet like Keto.#But I can also see a side that could lead people to focus too much on the values and not just the enjoyment of the food and experience itself.#I think that some of our customers would find value with it, but I feel that maybe some of our customers would rather not know what’s in that tasty traybake they had with their coffee and just enjoy the moment. It could really dampen the experience of eating out.#Some people also may not understand the information properly, such as understanding healthy and unhealthy fats, leading them to make choices based on incorrect information.#Personally, I believe every venue should consider their demographic and decide whether it is something that would work for them specically. It could have a negative impact on some venues that perhaps serve mostly high-calorie products.#Paul Patterson, restaurant manager of Montgomerie Restaurant, at Inverurie#s Golf Club in Aberdeenshire, understands the appeal, but is cautious about what it could mean for those living with eating disorders.He added: #Including calorie counts in menus helps customers make more informed choices about what they eat. In theory, it can help customers make healthier choices about what they eat.#However, one of the unintentional negative impacts of counts and nutritional information in menus is that it would be at the mental and physical detriment of those suffering from eating disorders.#In particular, calorie counts can promote food being seen as a #reward# that is #earned#. Even for those of us who are fortunate enough to not suffer from an eating disorder, eating out should be an enjoyable experience, not one controlled by anxiety around eating.#I certainly think that more cafes, pubs and restaurants should offer a menu and or information pack with the calorie count and nutritional information for those customers who wish to see it.#But I don#t think it should be a requirement for businesses.#As for James Boyd, owner and chef at No. in Kinross, he believes it would cause more hassle than it#s worth in the day-to-day running of his business.No. offers hand-roasted coffee, homemade cakes, breakfast, brunch, burgers, loaded fries, grilled cheeses and milkshakes.James said: #I think it should always be up to the businesses themselves to decide what is best for them. We probably wouldn#t add calories to our menu at No..Calorie counts can promote food being seen as a #reward# that is #earned#.#Paul Patterson of Montgomerie Restaurant#The main reasons why include that it may affect how we do daily specials and what we offer as it#s a lot to calculate for every dish # although I think some customers might appreciate it.#It makes more paperwork for us and takes some of the joy out of cooking. If someone was on a diet, they can just keep track of the calories for the meal.#Also, a lot of our suppliers are small local businesses to whom we would have to pass some work of calculating calories, which would probably increase prices.#The Big Lunch: Aberdeen community bakery invites people to break bread to reduce isolation\" title\"#The Big Lunch: Aberdeen community bakery invites people to break bread to reduce isolation# #

It remained a family home until , when it was converted to a hotel.It built its reputation as an excellent place for visitors to stay. It was also a popular place for conferences, weddings and other social gatherings.A sudden loss of income when public events were banned in March , due to Covid-, delivered a devastating blow.Bosses said the coronavirus crisis was #the final straw#, at the time the business going into liquidation last November.

programme now under way, we#ve put together a collection of Covid vaccine tracker charts to monitor the progress of the Covid- vaccine rollout across the UK.How many people have been vaccinated How many people have received the vaccine in my area Which demographics have received the vaccine When will I receive my coronavirus vaccine The Covid vaccine tracker below shows an at-a-glance view of the current proportion of the Scottish population who have received the first and second dose of either the Oxford AstraZaneca or the Pfizer BioNTech vaccination so far.The table below is an at-a-glance view of the total figures by group.Data on the number of people vaccinated was initially provided in a weekly report from Public Health Scotland, however there was immense pressure to keep the public more regularly informed so on January  the statistics began to be provided each day.The chart below shows the daily numbers of first and second doses provided.The chart below shows the cumulative number of people who have received each dose since the vaccination programme began on December .It#s also helpful to look at this data as a proportion of the Scottish population so you can see how the percentage of people vaccinated grows over time.The chart below shows the progress for each UK country.On January , Public Health Scotland provided this data broken down by vaccine type which is shown in the chart below.The map below shows the available data on the regional rollout of the vaccination programme.January  saw the release of data by local authority area for the first time, which is shown in the map below.Regional data was originally available on a weekly basis but moved to a daily upload on February . The chart below contains data on the daily number of doses provided and the population covered. Use the drop down box to select your area and the buttons to move between daily vaccinations, cumulative vaccinations and the percentage of the population who have received first doses.Similarly to the regional data, data by demographics were originally provided in the weekly PHS report # however on February  they moved to a daily publication schedule.The chart below shows the daily number of people who have had first doses in each age range, as well as the percentage of that population, covered.Public Health Scotland began reporting daily statistics on vaccinations by JCVI categories in mid-March. The chart below shows the percentage of each group who have received their first and second doses.The vaccines are being provided in accordance with the priority list drawn up by the joint committee on vaccination and immunisation .

This decision, however, was to prove costly for the senior pair of Ian Guy and Neil Ward who, having had their younger opponents on toast for most of the game, crumbled like one of Mary Berry’s cakes in the final two ends to hand victory to Alan Guy and Craig Bruce -.The senior heavyweight battles continued, with Michael Heafey and Colin MacInnes slugging it out with Archie MacVicar and Donald Crawford.Despite some hefty blows being landed by each pair they could not be separated, and peels prevailed at -, though MacVicar looked the freshest after this -rounder.Rink one was not quite living up to its billing. To use a golfing term there were quite a lot of #shanks# about, with Scott #Lefty# Gargan and Fiona McLeod locked in battle with their mates John Kennedy and Dorothy Clark, who had a vice-like grip on the match, whipping ahead -.In the league cross-over game, dark horses Mark Harkness and Richard Dewar were put to the sword by the evergreen Sandy Crawford and young Murray MacDonald.Neither of the two to-guns were wearing a mask on the green, but they ought to have as they robbed the dark horses at the last post to ride into the sunset with victory by an - margin.The week#s star pair were undoubtedly Anne Moore and Libby McGuinness, who were in cruise control for most of their match against Roddy MacDonald and Jamie MacLean.The Penelope Pitstop and Dick Dastardly of this whacky race left only scorched tyre tracks as they sped to an impressive - victory, despite Libby#s concern that the Arkansas Chuggabugs had a secret weapon, to pull out six shots in the last end.As the next round approaches, Guy and Ward willto the gym the undertaker will need to resurrect his form, the postman will need to deliver and the tea table out at Lingerton will be ided, with some cups tasting just that bit sweeter.With the Portavadie Cup, for the seasons most consistent player, well underway, a few players have posted notable wins with Liz Long notching her first three pointer and Colin #Last Bowl# MacInnes remaining unbeaten."},{"url":null,"title":"cash jump for youth football","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

As impartial observers it is always intriguing to watch the demeanour of candidates and followers changing as the count, and night, progresses. There is usually a palpable tension in the air.But there was none of that at this count. Carried out in a dferent way during daytime, physically spread out, limited attendees, socially distanced and cordoned off behind plastic.Everyone behind the planning of the election in Argyll and Bute deserves a huge pat on the back. It is always a massive undertaking, but the pandemic precautions this year made it doubly so.Well done to all involved in its organisation, and congratulations to Jenni Minto, an adopted Ileach, on her victory.It is a prominent landmark in Lochgilphead, and it would be exciting to see the Clock Lodge used for something.

We once again highlighted our concerns over a lack of immediate action on the crisis at the Rest and be ThankfulDear Roy and Hugh,I am writing in response to an official Transport Scotland email to the Rest and be Thankful Campaign on the April , where you have sought to answer several questions posed by us at our meeting with your officials and in subsequent emails to you both. We are hugely disappointed by this response and its apparent contradictions.We asked for a permanent solution within the next three years. The email states #we are not waiting for anything and are pushing on with work at pace# yet your actions since the August landslide have only created delay.We believe creating  options for consultation in November  and five further options for consultation in March was a time-wasting exercise. We strongly believe there are only three real options, with studies on these completed in your  report.A geological survey, which will take  months to complete, could have started last August, assuming you had not conducted such surveys in .We have asked for temporary use of the forestry road, away from the threats posed by landsides.The email states: #We were clear without that information we are not certain the forestry track in its current form is safe for use#, yet we would argue you already have a Transerv report produced in  by Balfour Beatty and Mouchal Services Ltd for Transport Scotland which suggested the forestry road could be upgraded in - weeks. How did Transerv arrive at this conclusion without a study of the ground conditions being done in advance This situation should be considered a safety, economic and social emergency, cutting through the red tape of consultation and delay.It further declares that #we understand first-hand the delay that can be caused by procedural challenge…there needs to be a careful balancing of accelerating development and procedural risk in order to ensure that we do not end up in the courts#.While we understand the need for the right balance of speed and consultation, we think the safety risks, costs incurred by business and damage to the economy of Argyll should create the conditions for emergency action, delivering what should be a simple road realignment.This is not HS, we are not asking to blight the countryside or people#s homes you do not have whole communities ready to challenge fixing the crisis at the Rest and be Thankful. What we want cannot be worse than the damage already inflicted on the hillside without consultation. If you fixed the rest, we will all be thankful.The following questions still have not been answered in Transport Scotland#s official reply or in recent press statements:If the next landslide, or subsequent ersion along the equally inadequate A, results in a fatality who will be held accountable Who is responsible for the social and economic impact on the people and businesses of Argyll while we wait another  years for something permanent to be done We are business people and understand the need for safe environments, effective procedures, timely management and cost control, but what we have experienced over the past year does not give us confidence you will address the concerns we have.We are not looking for you to defend your approach, what matters to us is the action taken to bring timescales down and resolve the problem within the next parliament.We are simply asking you to rethink your approach, look at how your team can cut through this #business as usual# process and appoint someone who can find a way to realign two km of the A safely within the next three years.By challenging your approach, we are hoping to see that after nearly a year of delay and ersion, there is a recognition of the cost impact to business, the signicant safety concerns, and that this will continue to blight Argyll as a place to live, work, and invest in until a permanent solution is delivered.We will be working with the relevant politicians post elections and will continue to campaign for a change in approach.We would be happy to discuss what can be done to overcome any constraints you have to deliver a solution quickly and resolve the crisis at the Rest and be Thankful.John Gurr, chairman, The Rest and be Thankful CampaignSir,Mental Health Awareness Week opened on Monday May  and we are inviting everyone to #ConnectWithNature to support their mental health.Spending quality time in and around nature can help to reduce stress and increase feelings of positivity, and you don’t have to be surrounded by fields or have to take a walk in the wilderness to feel the benefits.The Mental Health Foundation, which works to prevent mental health problems and has organised this awareness week for the past  years, encourages you to recognise and grow your connection with nature by sharing a photo, video or sound recording with your family and friends, and on your social media.Connecting with nature can really make a dference to your mental health, and now more than ever, it is time to look after yours.Julie Walters, actorSir,Alan Reid, Dunoon"},{"url":null,"title":"riverside kids vote for nature","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

However, there now seems to be an acceptance in Transport Scotland that a new solution has to be found.In a letter to the press, George Allan points out that the -mile route from Strathlachlan to Colintraive and the eight miles between Ormidale and Tighnabruaich were designed and constructed in  or  years.I was a member of the survey and design team on these routes. I was also involved in the construction of  miles of the A between Perth and Inverness in  years. These civil engineering schemes demonstrate what can be achieved when there is real political will and commitment to prioritise projects.I realise Transport Scotland has its own procedures for appointing consultants for the design processes and there are detailed environmental impact assessments to be done. It does, however, seem to me that its programming of the Rest and be Thankful improvement is completely lacking in ambition.As a former director of roads and transport in Highland, perhaps I may be permitted to comment on the long-term solution.I would saythere are no geological features found on the other side of the glen which will cause a repeat of current problems, then the construction of a new road in ersion would cause less disruption to traffic than trying to form landslip shelters or tunnels adjacent to the existing carriageway.The main thing though is for Transport Scotland and their political masters to just get on with it.Philip Shimmin, Inverness.Sir,I would like to say thank you to all the lads who have been working at the Crinan Canal # often when the north winds were blowing and water was pouring down from the hills into the empty canal more quickly than the pumps were able to remove it.The men greeted me each morning as I walked past to go over the temporary bridge.

With the evenings getting longer and brighter you can use your garden or patio as a great extension to your home and just sit back and relax.It’s at this time of year that lawns need to be mowed more frequently, so here are some key pointers on getting that perfect cared-for look.Mow at least once a week and raise the mower blades when it’s very hot weather. Don’t mow when grass is wet or during a drought and don’t collect your clippings during dry spells as this helps conserve moisture.Keep watering throughout the summer unless there is a water shortage and repair bare patches with turf or re-seeding.This is also the month to ensure that all your plants are adequately fed, particularly those in baskets and tubs.Plants benefit from a regular feeding programme as they are growing vigorously and need their nutrition levels to be kept up. Slow-release granules are a good idea for pots and baskets because they last for about six months and release food as it is required into the compost.Not often thought of as a container plant, but an excellent option for small gardens, is a rose.A simple solution for June is to create an instant rose garden that you can enjoy throughout the summer.Just buy a selection of dferent sized pots, plant them with a ieties of roses and then place them together in a group.There is a rose for every garden situation. From hybrid teas to miniatures, climbers to floribundas, the choice is endless.Roses are easy to grow and will thrive in most soil types providing there is good drainage.They prefer a position that is sunny and not too exposed and need regular feeding which will improve their resistance to pests and disease, although some roses will require spraying to combat aphids and mildew. Pruning is also important to remove dead heads and improve flowering over a longer period of time.If you are replacing old roses with new ones, ensure that the old soil is removed and replaced with fresh soil.As the temperature rises and midsummer day arrives, here are few ‘must do’ jobs for the garden this month from the Royal Horticultural Society:"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters a unique holiday destination","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

But never mind, Chinese astronauts, who regard a moon base as essential for probing outer space, have just about solved these problems with a bioregenerative le support system called Yuegong-, or Lunar Palace  . LP is a temperature and humidity-controlled, sealed, articial human-animal-plant-microorganism ecosystem in which oxygen, water and food sources are recycled to create an Earth-like environment. The latest experiment had LP in use continuously for a whole year, with two crews of four each having two periods of occupation and the maximum stay being  days. All emerged fit and healthy.LP comprises a living area, two cabins for growing plants , an animal-raising room housing yellow mealworms and waste treatment and storage rooms.Crew requirements # food, water, oxygen and waste disposal # are accommodated as follows: plants and mealworms provide food, the latter being processed into ‘flour’ for bread.Plant photosynthesis provides oxygen and consumes CO, while puried water from plant transpiration and condensation provides drinking and washing water.Nitrogen puried from crew urine generates plant fertiliser, while the remaining urine is puried along with waste water for plant irrigation.Crew faeces mixed with straw are fermented by bacteria to produce CO for plant photosynthesis, while fermented vegetable waste is fed to the mealworms. The whole system achieved  per cent recycling, the only non-recyclable product requiring storage being solid waste from fermented faeces.All this represents huge progress, but we are not there yet. Running LP requires massive energy input, particularly since lunar days and nights each last an Earth month, and the nights are freezing.But still, I have read of plans to build kilometre-high lunar towers bearing solar  , possible because of the moon’s zero gravity, but don’t hold your breath!* https:doi.org . ...# arxiv.org abs ."},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures may 21 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

His score, in fact, bettered those competing in the under- section from across Scotland.With his latest, win Connor moves up the rankings, opening the door for him to play in strokeplay events.Such is his level of skill that he plays with adult members at his home Tarbert Golf Club.

Finlay this time finding the bottom corner with a neat finish for his first Red Star goal.Cardross kept battling and gave themselves a glimmer of hope with  minutes remaining when they were awarded a penalty after Star failed to clear their lines. -.The last goal of the match was the best, with an excellent passing move begun by Jake Weir in goals, worked through to Lee MacLean in midfield before eventually falling to Stuart MacLean, who got the goal that his all-round play deserved.Star saw out the game in relative comfort with the back three of Coll McCallum, Aaron Moore and Andy Weir remaining resolute throughout.Red Star welcome Dunoon Ams tomorrow, Saturday May , to Lochgilphead Joint Campus for their second of three group matches.Kick-off is at pm, with local whistler Jimmy Litster in charge."},{"url":null,"title":"the softer crofter the knapdale dude ranch experience","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Dunchraigaig Cairn, are the earliest known in Scotland and the first clear examples of deer carvings from the Neolithic to Early Bronze Age in the whole of the UK.This is also the first time ancient animal carvings have been discovered alongside cup and ring markings in the UK.Discovery of the , to ,-year-old artwork shatters long-held perceptions about prehistoric cultures and adds to the reputation of Kilmartin Glen as a site of global signicance.The carvings were discovered by chance by Oxfordshire man Hamish Fenton, who has a background in archaeology, while visiting Kilmartin Glen.The carvings are located inside the cairn on the capstone of an Early Bronze Age burial cist.Kilmartin Glen has one of the most important concentrations of Neolithic and Bronze Age remains in Scotland, including some of the finest cup and ring markings in the country.Dr Tertia Barnett, principal investigator for Scotland’s Rock Art Project at Historic Environment Scotland , said: #It was previously thought that prehistoric animal carvings of this date didn’t exist in Scotland, although they are known in parts of Europe, so it is very exciting that they have now been discovered here for the first time in the historic Kilmartin Glen.#This extremely rare discovery completely changes the assumption that prehistoric rock art in Britain was mainly geometric and non-figurative.#While there are a few prehistoric carvings of deer in the UK, the only other ones created in the Early Bronze Age are very schematic.#It is remarkable that these carvings in Dunchraigaig Cairn show such great anatomical detail and there is no doubt about which animal species they represent.#This also tells us that the local communities were carving animals as well as cup and ring mots which is in keeping with what we know of other Neolithic and Bronze Age societies, particularly in Scandinavia and Iberia.#Until now, we did not know of any area in Britain with both types of carvings, which poses questions about the relationship between them and their signicance to the people that created them.#Following Hamish’s discovery, experts from Scotland’s Rock Art Project examined the carvings to confirm their authenticity.This included utilizing innovative technology in their analysis.A structured light scan was carried out by HES digital documentation experts to create an accurate and detailed D model with photographic texture, and ious visualisation techniques were then applied to the model in order to reveal more details of the carvings than would have been visible to the naked eye.Dr Barnett added: #Digital techniques are being used more and more frequently to create precise D models of rock art and reveal details that were previously unknown to us, or that we only suspected.#Digital technology is becoming increasingly important for archaeology, and particularly for rock art, and is a key to unlocking the hidden secrets of our past.#This incredible discovery in Dunchraigaig Cairn makes us wonderother animal carvings previously unknown to the UK are hidden in unexpected places in our ancient landscapes, waiting to be uncovered in the future.#The cairn, which is in care of HES, is m wide and contained three stone burial chambers, or cists.The third cist, where the carvings are located, was dug directly into the ground, lined with drystone cobbled walls and capped with an unusually large stone over .m long.The remains of up to  iniduals, some cremated, were also discovered here when the site was initially excavated in the s, as well as artefacts including a whetstone, a greenstone axe and a flint kne.Hamish Fenton said: #I was passing Dunchraigaig Cairn at dusk when I noticed the burial chamber in the side of the cairn and decided to slide inside with my torch.#As I shone the torch around, I noticed a pattern on the underside of the roof slab which didn’t appear to be natural markings in the rock.#As I shone the light around further, I could see that I was looking at a deer stag upside down, and as I continued looking around, more animals appeared on the rock.#This was a completely amazing and unexpected find and, to me, discoveries like this are the real treasure of archaeology, helping to reshape our understanding of the past.#The cairn is currently closed while HES carries out further evaluation and puts measures in place to protect the extremely rare, and delicate, ancient carvings.Kilmartin Museum curator Dr Sharon Webb MBE said: #The archaeology of Kilmartin Glen is extraordinary, and every new discovery adds to its international importance.#Future research will help us to understand how this amazing and unique art fits into the story of the glen, which is really exciting.#We’re in the process of rebuilding the museum with a £. million redevelopment and we’ll be including interpretations of this rock art in the new exhibitions when they open in .#PICS:Deer antlers can be seen carved into the rock.

The dip now is actually worse than when the cattle grid was in place.To make matters worse, the damaged cattle grid, which is now mangled metal, has been left on the adjacent roadside verge.It is my strong belief thatcattle grids are damaged, the roads department should replace them with new fit-for-propose cattle grids, not get rid of them all together.Not only should road repairs be made to last but at the very least the roads department should clean up after itself and remove old damaged materials such as this left behind.If a private company or an inidual member of the public left a large amount of scrap metal at the side of the road they would be in trouble.I have contacted our roads management through member services and asked them to recty this matter as soon as possible.I am a GP in one of Argyll#s rural practices. Last week I was having a busy morning so was a little later than usual getting back to my car, which I had left charging at an electric charge point.That evening I was surprised to see that I#d been charged £ over and above the normal charging rate per KwH.I checked through the Argyll and Bute website and discovered that there is now an overstay charge – hence the surcharge.I had received an email back in April saying that Argyll and Bute Council would now be charging users at its charge points – the cost being p per KwH. Fair enough.However, there was no mention of a penalty for overstaying. Nor is there any notice at the charge points themselves, save a tiny notice stating #charges apply#.Those seeking to charge in Argyll and Bute are additionally confused by the lack of clarity over what type of charge point is being used: is it a  Kw, Kw or a  Kw. There is no notice on the chargers. This is important because the overstay timings y according to the dfering units.When I buy petrol at a filling station, I clearly know what the charges are when I buy a ticket at a parking meter, I buy a ticket and know exactly how long I am able to park there.But it seems that for electric vehicles you have to search the internet to find out the rules – and in my village there is no local WiFi and I cannot get G on my phone.As a responsible democrat I thought, when this election was called, that I would write to the candidates to ask them a few questions before deciding how to vote.We had no hustings this time, even in Campbeltown, and our MSP has not visited the town for ages. So election time seems to be the only opportunity to enter into dialogue with those who want to represent us.Last year I published a book about the uncertain future for the rule of law in Scotland. The irreducible basis of a rule-of-law society is reciprocity between those who make the laws and those who have to obey them. Without dialogue, that is impossible.Only two parties sent me a leaflet with enough time to allow an exchange of emails: first the SNP and then the LibDems.I started by asking the SNP candidate, Jenni Minto, for a CV. That was initially refused, then a redacted one sent. Next, I asked about the Hate Crime Act. I got a long answer ending with a quotation from the English philosopher, Karl Popper: #In order to maintain a tolerant society, the society must be intolerant to intolerance.#I wrote back quoting Bertrand Russell, who said that enforced morality is not morality at all it is pure obedience. Likewise, enforced tolerance is not tolerance, just obedience. I asked what she thought of the criminalisation of dinner-time conversations and other aspects of the Act. It was at that point that the dialogue broke down.I changed the subject to independence. This time I did get a reply, but it was evasive.For example, I had asked what the most important features of the UK were that made her want Scotland to leave it. Ms Minto replied that an independent country would get the government it votes for. That implied thatScotland and England voted for the same party, there would be no need for independence. So, by extension, whatArgyll wanted a dferent government from that in Holyrood  Should it declare independence from Scotland, as Orkney and Shetland have said they willthe UK breaks up  I wrote for clarication, but Ms Minto did not reply.I also wrote to Alan Reid of the LibDems. He sent a CV, but when I replied to that with questions about LibDem policy, I heard nothing more.That, in Scotland, appears to be the limit of dialogue between the rulers and the ruled. Perhaps that explains something about the parliament itself.With Sun Awareness Week taking place this week, Cats Protection would like to advise cat owners to be aware of the risks posed to their cat by the sun.Pale-coloured cats, or those with unpigmented white noses or ears, are particularly at risk from the sun#s rays which can cause sunburn and skin cancer.Those affected can suffer long-term damage including, in severe cases, having to have their ear tips removed to prevent the cancer from spreading.Following a few simple tips owners can help protect their cat from the harmful effects of the sun.These include keeping them indoors on sunny days between am and pm, asking your vet for advice about suitable sunscreen and ensuring you provide plenty of shade to enable your cat to shelter from the sun#s rays."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week may 7 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Yet, at the same time, we are becoming increasingly suspicious that the label on freedom has been switched.For some people appear to be devaluing freedom. They seem to think it means no constraints on their behaviour. They have the right to do whatever they want, evenit causes damage to themselves, to others and to the environment.Jesus makes it clear that freedom is something quite dferent. It is being set free from the tyrannical oppression of our own self-centredness – what the Bible calls sin – empowering us to be free to love God by willingly obeying his Word and to love others by humbly looking out for their best interests.Not only did Jesus tell us in his teaching and show us by his example what label freedom should have, but by his real death on the cross, his physical and historical resurrection and the gt of his Spirit, he made it possible for us to experience it.We must not be conned by the switch that has been made to freedom#s label.Instead, let us restore its label back to its correct, Jesus-defined and le-changing setting, and through faith in Jesus alone, value and enjoy the freedom he secured by his death."},{"url":null,"title":"enjoy running a mok but please do so safely","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

We are hugely disappointed by this response and its apparent contradictions.We asked for a permanent solution within the next three years. The email states: #We are not waiting for anything and are pushing on with work at pace#, yet your actions since the August landslide have only created delay.Creating  options for consultation in November , this, we believe, is a time-wasting exercise. Five further options for consultation in March. We strongly believe there are only three real options, with studies on these completed in your  report. Conducting a geological survey which will take eighteen months to complete, a process that could have started last August, assuming you had not conducted such surveys in .We have asked for temporary use of the forestry road, away from the threats posed by landsides. It also states: #We were clear without that information we are not certain the forestry track in its current form is safe for use.# Yet we would argue you already have a Transerv report produced in  by Balfour Beatty and Mouchal Services Ltd for TS which suggested the forestry road could be upgraded in  to  weeks. How did Transerv arrive at this conclusion without a study of the ground conditions being done in advance This situation should be considered a safety, economic and social emergency, cutting through the red tape of consultation and delay. It further declares: #We understand first-hand the delay that can be caused by procedural challenge…there needs to be a careful balancing of accelerating development and procedural risk in order to ensure that we do not end up in the courts.#While we understand the need for the right balance of speed and consultation, we think the safety risks, costs incurred by business and damage to the economy of Argyll, should create the conditions for emergency action, delivering what should be a simple road realignment. This is not HS, we are not asking to blight the countryside, or people#s homes, you do not have whole communities ready to challenge fixing the crisis at RABT.What we want cannot be worse than the damage already inflicted on the hillside without consultation. If you fixed the Rest, we will all be thankful.The following questions still have not been answered in TS#s official reply or in recent press statements:We are business people and understand the need for safe environments, effective procedures, timely management, and cost control, but what we have experienced over the past year does not give us confidence you will address the concerns we have.We are not looking for you to defend your approach, what matters to us is the action taken to bring timescales down and resolve the problem within the next parliament. We are simply asking you to rethink your approach, look at how your team can cut through this #business as usual# process and appoint someone who can find a way to realign two kilometres of the A safely within the next three years.By challenging your approach, we are hoping to see that after nearly a year of delay and ersion, there is a recognition of the cost impact to business, the signicant safety concerns, and that this will continue to blight Argyll as a place to live, work, and invest in until a permanent solution is delivered.We will be working with the relevant politicians post elections and will continue to campaign for a change in approach. We would be happy to discuss what can be done to overcome any constraints you have to deliver a solution quickly and resolve the crisis at the RABT.We stand at a once-in-a-generation crossroads.Earlier this week, a thought-provoking poem, ACCEPTABLE  by the Anonymous Mother # judged for needing a food bank to feed her child # started a nationwide debate about whether the world#s fth richest country should need food banks to feed children.This conversation needed to happen as our food bank crisis has become critical.Last year food banks in the Trussell Trust#s network handed out , emergency food parcels for children in the UK. This surely cannot be acceptable.However, fate has given us a rare opportunity, as history shows us that the best time to create a brighter future is after times of great darkness.The pandemic has been the most devastating event to hit our country since the Second World War, but it also brought out the very best of our nation.We recognised our real community heroes, we protected the vulnerable, we didn#t stand by when kids went hungry.But now, as we prepare to wake up from the pandemic nightmare, millions of British families still cannot afford food on their table.As the Anonymous Mother poetically says # it doesn#t need to be this way.In , Britain woke up to its new dawn at a similar crossroads # go back to the old broken way, or use this golden opportunity to make things better.That great generation chose hope, and created a better, fairer society for all # including founding the NHS.This pandemic has been our generation#s darkest hour. This is now our new dawn, our choice. Will we choose the old broken way, or use this golden opportunity to eradicate hunger in the UK I urge you to do just one thing today, and that is to seek out the poem that started all of this, and reflect.If, afterwards, you agree with me and the hundreds of thousands of other supporters of the Trussell Trust, that we can do better, join us as we collectively create a #hunger free future#."},{"url":null,"title":"inez picks up prizes amid winning streak","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

It#s a really exciting move as it offers the potential to climb the Scottish football pyramid.#From the club#s point of view, we want to find our standard amongst the new teams joining the set up.#We want to be the best we can be as the senior team of the Campbeltown and District Community Football Club.#With our acceptance into the WoSFL, we can offer a pathway for the youngest age groups right through to the under- side, being trained by Stuart Crossan, into our first team, representing Campbeltown in non-league football.#With that, it#s important to acknowledge the huge amount of hard work that has gone into making Campbeltown#s community club a Gold Merit Award holder, one of only seven clubs in the Scottish Football AssociationWest region, encompassing all of Glasgow and the west. This accolade was a major factor in our acceptance into the WoSFL.#Other factors in the Pupils# favour before WoSFL committee scrutiny included having changing facilities for two teams of up to  players each, a separate referee#s room, and an enclosed ground with spectator barriers.Campbell said of the club#s Kintyre Park home: #The renovation of the pavilion is nearing completion, through a fundraising campaign led by club chairman Alex McKinven.#Campbell added: #The SAFL was a great  for us to play competitive amateur football for  years. In periods, we went through some wilderness years but we have happy memories of successful title-winning seasons, too.#In recent seasons, however, the club became disillusioned with how the league was going, with dficulty getting referees and sometimes teams to travel to Kintyre at a week#s notice – this was not a feature against even rival teams in years gone by.#In the WosFL, our geography could not be a determining factor in league entry as we are SFA West region members, which meant that the criteria we could meet on a match day, and the quality of our community club pathway, mattered most.#Meanwhile, the Pupils are gearing up for le in the WoSFL with contact training resuming on Tuesday evening.The team have been training twice weekly in a non-contact setting to build up their base fitness since March.Campbell added: #Training has been well attended, led by coaches Norman Thomson and Lewis Mackay, and although it has been hard to get the players together with ongoing restrictions, the squad are right behind the move and excited about the challenge ahead.#Campbeltown Pupils are keen to hear from anyone who would be able to help with ground and park maintenance.

As German troops advanced through Normandy, the st fought valiantly, protecting French citizens, hoping evacuation by sea would be forthcoming.On June  , German tanks surrounded the ision at the French fishing port of St Valéry. This, alongside a curtain of heavy fog, made the long-awaited flotilla rescue unviable and they were forced to surrender. Those who were not killed in the fighting were captured as prisoners of war and marched to camps in Eastern Europe, where they remained for five gruelling years.Following the commemorations to mark the th anniversary of the battle last June, a remarkable story has emerged. One brave soldier miraculously evaded capture and was taken in by a French family who hid him from the occupying German forces.#We were contacted by Monsieur Patrick Prieur, a -year-old St Valéry resident whose grandparents and father remained in the town during the entirety of the war. He told us the story of the escapee and the tragedy that befell him,# said Dr Claire Armstrong, chief executive of Legion Scotland.#As we approach the st anniversary of the battle, we hope to identy this Scottish hero, give him the recognition he deserves and bring peace to his family.#Patrick Prieur recalled the tale his late father told him: #A soldier from the st Highland Division was hidden by a family in the village. They bonded and the family learned he was a married man with a we and two daughters waiting for him tohome.#For several weeks, the soldier remained hidden but, regretfully, he was eventually discovered by German troops and marched through the town to the municipal cemetery.#After being forced to dig his own grave, he was positioned against the cemetery wall and shot. His death deeply upset the townspeople, who had been aware of his hiding, and especially my father, who was only  at the time.#In later years, the Franco-British military cemetery was built and his body was moved there. His grave is marked as #Known unto God# and my father and other villagers tended to it for decades after the war ended.#Monsieur Prieur added: #My father had been gted a piece of paper on which the soldier#s name was written, #Keller Len Scott#, and this became his prized possession. He desperately wanted to find the soldier#s family to tell them what had happened to their beloved and where he was laid to rest, but having very little information, he struggled.#In  my father passed away and, being eager to finish what he started, I recently contacted Poppyscotland and the Highland Reserve Forces# and Cadets# Association to ask for help.#Michelle McKearnon, head of engagement at the Highland Reserve Forces# and Cadets# Association, said: #We started to do our own research to unearth the fallen soldier#s identity but only got so far. We believe the name order on the piece of paper may have been written in military fashion, with the surname preceding any given names, so the family name might be Keller.#We#re now at an impasse, struggling to find additional information through our own resources, so we need the knowledge of the wider community to continue our efforts.#Dr Armstrong added: #We are urging anyone who believes they know of or has any information about our #Unknown Soldier#, no matter how small, to get in touch.#This brave man fought valiantly for his country and to repay our debt to him for his service would be an honour, not only for Legion Scotland as custodians of remembrance, but for his family, Monsieur Prieur#s father, the people of St Valéry and, ultimately, for all the #unknown soldiers# who sacriced their lives for us.#Anyone with information that could help identy the soldier should visit poppyscotland.org.uk stvalery"},{"url":null,"title":"engines at the ready mach 1 stages rally gets go ahead","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

They did notto the harbour until after pm with the casualty in tow.The following day, Sceptre skipper Tom Smith praised the hard work and efficiency of the Campbeltown leboat crews.Diver Robert Lamont, a member of the leboat crew the night before, went in and removed the damaged rudder ready for Sceptre to be towed by tug to Troon, the finish of the race.The race sails from Oban to Mull, Jura and Arran then Troon, stopping at each island for a team of runners to complete a hill race.Sceptre, with a crew of four, was carrying the boys# team from Glenalmond School, Perth.She had run aground the night before entering Craighouse, Jura. Everything looked fine on the yacht, which was built in Argyll at Alexander Robertson#s Holy Loch yard to compete in the America#s Cup of .#As a precaution, we did not have the boys on board for the tough leg round the Mull of Kintyre to Arran,# said crew member Roger Finbow.#They haven#t missed the race they were on board Blue Damsel, carrying the girls# team.#The decision proved a wise move as not only did the rudder come loose leaving the yacht with no steering, it was flapping wildly and in danger of damaging the hull.As a precaution, the leboat crew put a heavy-duty pump on board but this was not needed.HMS Dragon broke off her sea trials to come to the aid of Sceptre. The Type  Clyde-built destroyer stood by until the leboat arrived.TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AGOCalls were mounting earlier this week for a Scottish Office decision on the proposed ferry link between Campbeltown and Northern Ireland.The Scottish Office has been considering a business plan for state-owned Caledonian MacBrayne to operate the link with Ballycastle in Northern Ireland since the beginning of February.The company needs Scottish Office permission to become involved in the project.But concern is growing that unless a decision is made soon the necessary harbour work at Campbeltown will not start until it is too late for the service to begin next year.Two Campbeltown ambulance men were among six from Argyll recently presented with long service and good conduct medals by the Duke of Argyll.Ronnie Hamilton and Malcolm Black travelled to Oban for the presentation, carried out by the Duke on behalf of HM Queen.The medals are not awarded automatically but are made on the recommendation of a special .The Duke told the ambulance men: #What you do is not a profession, it is a vocation.#He also paid tribute to their families, pointing out the ambulance men worked anti-social hours for long periods at a time.FIFTY YEARS AGOCampbeltown was #switched on# to colour television on Tuesday by the town#s new Provost, William Craig, in his first official engagement.The service has been brought to Campbeltown by Redfusion, the firm which pipes television to several thousand subscribers from its mast at Crosshill Farm.The firm#s Scottish general manager Mr Colin Payne said that Redfusion offers a public service of which they were proud.#We looked at the television problems here. There were just BBC and STV and occasionally Ulster in the town.#We said can we bring to Campbeltown the full range of colour programmes which are available where and the answer to that was #yes#.#There are now six programmes on the system. There aren#t many places in the country which can receive this.#ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOAn English steam liner which called in here for bait one day last week had full bunkers and a plentul reserve of coal in ious corners. She had gone to Ostende for the fuel.A further restriction of the gas supply in the burgh comes into force on Saturday night. The hours during which there will be reduced and normal pressure respectively are given in advertisement.The local branch of the Miners# Union opened a subscription list this week for the purpose of starting a communal soup kitchen.

I was also involved in the construction of  miles of the A between Perth and Inverness in  years. These civil engineering schemes demonstrate what can be achieved when there is real political will and commitment to prioritise projects.I realise Transport Scotland has its own procedures for appointing consultants for the design processes and there are detailed environmental impact assessments to be done. It does, however, seem to me that its programming of the Rest and Be Thankful improvement is completely lacking in ambition.As a former director of roads and transport in Highland, perhaps I may be permitted to comment on the long-term solution.I would saythere are no geological features found on the other side of the glen which will cause a repeat of current problems, then the construction of a new road in ersion would cause less disruption to traffic than trying to form landslip shelters or tunnels adjacent to the existing carriageway.The main thing though is for Transport Scotland and their political masters to just get on with it.This week, Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulancemarks its eighth anniversary – after a year like no other.Throughout the coronavirus pandemic, our Helimed crews have never missed a beat maintaining our emergency helicopter air ambulance service across Scotland#s mainland and island communities. In fact we#ve enhanced our service with the launch of a new aircraft – Helimed  in Aberdeen last year – which has already had a huge impact on pre-hospital care in the Grampian, Highland and island regions.In our busiest year ever, our aircrew have endured challenging working conditions, with additional procedures and cumbersome protective and safety equipment as they go about an already dficult and stressful job.But they#re not complaining – this is what the Scottish public ask of them, to save and improve lives, wherever the need arises, and they fulfil their role with courage and pride.Our exemplary performance during this national crisis has been a tribute to how far SCAA has come in just eight years and I, for one, am immensely proud of what the SCAA team has achieved.But our operational teams are acutely aware that we are only able to provide this critical service, thanks to the continued public donations which you have maintained throughout these dficult times. So you are the real heroes in our charity.SCAA is the people#s helicopter – funded by the people of Scotland, for the people of Scotland – and our two frontline aircraft are stood by ready to help you, your family, your friends, colleagues, neighbours or anyone in your community when you most need us.As we mark our eighth birthday on May , we are asking the people of Scotland,they can, to support us into the future. Any donation, however small, to celebrate our anniversary will help to save a le – just like the numerous lives we have already saved over almost , missions.SCAA vows to continue to transform emergency care in Scotland, particularly to our rural and island communities, with your support. Thank you.As a coalition of leading providers of care and support to vulnerable children and young people, we congratulate all MSPs on their election and welcome the consensus there is between the major political parties to tackle the growing mental health crisis in our young people.We have for some time raised concerns over a potential lost generation of vulnerable children and young people, whose mental health is being impacted even further by the Covid- pandemic.There have been dramatically increased waiting times for mental health treatment during lockdown.In December , for example,  per cent of children and young people had been waiting more than a year for specialist treatment, compared with . per cent in , a truly frightening statistic.A commitment by MSPs to focus on mental health, increasing investment in support services and intervention strategies, must be a priority for this parliament, giving our young people the care and support they need, when they need it.The frightening statistics on the deteriorating mental health of many young people presents a compelling case for a radical new plan for our struggling mental health services and for a national crusade to address what is a mental health pandemic, underpinned by considerably greater resourcing.This is a crisis we can overcome, but it will require a similar energy and commitment to that demonstrated for Covid-we are to achieve this and prevent many young people giving up on their futures.At sight loss charity RNIB Scotland, we are concerned the Covid- crisis might have impacted on people who are blind and partially sighted, many of whom are older.We would like to highlight the emotional reassurance and practical help we offer during the coronavirus lockdown and its aftermath.Covid has eclipsed all other health news in the past year but  people still start to lose their sight in Scotland every week. Add to that stress over Covid and the lockdowns and there could be more people needing support and reassurance.Our Need to Talk telephone counselling service remains available in Argyll and Bute and the Western Highlands for anyone diagnosed with sight loss, as well as families, friends and carers.Losing your sight can be devastating news to take in. But our trained helpers can support you in coming to terms with your condition and finding the way forward.The uncertainty during the Covid lockdown over access to basic shopping and medication, a lack of information in accessible formats, the social isolation, the barriers to being guided because of social distancing # these have all added to and compounded the mental and emotional stress people are experiencing.But we want people with sight loss to know they are not alone and that help is available.To contact the Need to Talk service, phone the RNIB Helpline on    or email needtotalk@rnib.org.uk"},{"url":null,"title":"photograph of the week may 21 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

From hybrid teas to miniatures, climbers to floribundas, the choice is endless.Roses are easy to grow and will thrive in most soil types, providing there is good drainage.They prefer a position that is sunny and not too exposed and need regular feeding which will improve their resistance to pests and disease, although some roses will require spraying to combat aphids and mildew.Pruning is also important to remove dead heads and improve flowering over a longer period of time.If you are replacing old roses with new ones, ensure that the old soil is removed and replaced with fresh soil.As the temperature rises and Midsummer#s Day arrives, here are few #must do# jobs for the garden this month from the Royal Horticultural Society:CAPTION:June is the perfect month for creating an instant rose garden that you can enjoy throughout the summer.

Mr Mitchell acknowledged receipt of these answers.I was alarmed and saddened by the headline #Failing# school is #betraying# pupils and the community# in last week#s Courier.Coming from a retired Campbeltown Grammar Schoolteacher, it is hard to believe that someone who has worked in the profession could have such criticism for his her fellow colleagues.Although clearly passionate about the future of CGS, perhaps retirement has helped this inidual forget what a challenging job all school staff face.It is commonly known that CGS has not had its troubles to seek in recent years with major staff shortages due to ill health and other unforeseen circumstances.The league tables do not make good reading but, on their own, I don#t think they reflect the efforts of the staff.It is a well known fact that you can take a horse to water but you cannot make it drink. Is the behaviour of pupils the greatest barrier to success Despite the efforts of teachers to discipline the pupils, there are few deterrents for the offenders, especially where the pupil is aware that,they ask, the parent will fight their corner instead of backing the school.The responsibility of teaching our children to behave and respect others needs to be instilled from early years by us all and not just when the child reaches CGS.Maybe the retired teacher should offer his her skills and visit CGS and see the problems that all staff are facing It is time for the community to pull together and support our school and encourage our children to believe that a good education is very achievable in CGS.Recently, an investigation by the Herald newspaper uncovered that #just over half of Scotland#s leline ferry network is operating outwith its working le expectancy#, with  vessels out of  in operation over  years old.Despite the huge challenges created by the Covid- pandemic that our hard-working ferry crews have to deal with,  residents rightly expect a high quality ferry service that runs on time and has enough space to ensure they can travel to and from the islands, businesses can transport goods to the mainland and tourists can visit our islands to boost the economy.Unfortunately, cancellations and delays continue to plague routes. I have been working closely with residents, our community councils and other parties to find long-term solutions.This pressing matter simply can#t be left on the backburner.The  National Lottery Awards are now open for entries.Once again, the annual search for the UK#s favourite National Lottery-funded people and projects will recognise those iniduals and organisations who have made an extraordinary impact in their community – especially during these unprecedent times.National Lottery players raise £ million every week for good causes and we know this money is being used in amazing and inspiring ways.As part of The National Lottery Awards, we want to celebrate those whose selfless dedication and fantastic work makes such a dference in villages, towns and cities across the country.Encompassing all areas of National Lottery funding, you nominate local legends and hometown heroes in the following categories: culture, arts and film, community charity, heritage and sport.In addition, there will be a young hero award for someone under the age of .Groups or organisations are eligible to enter The National Lottery Project of the Year category, where shortlisted finalists will face a public vote later in the year.All award winners will receive an iconic National Lottery Awards trophy and £, for their organisation.Nominations can be made by completing an entry form on our website at www.lotterygoodcauses.org.uk awards.All nominees must have been funded by The National Lottery or be associated with a National Lottery funded project. Entries must be received by midnight on June .Now, as we approach summer with hopefully fewer restrictions, we can start to make plans about how we will spend time with family and friends.Following the challenging year we have experienced, we could all do with a bit more play in our lives. Play is a hugely important part of childhood and has a whole host of benefits, including improving physical and mental health and wellbeing.Throughout this pandemic, children have had to deal with so many dficult challenges some having to stay in unsafe homes and many living with families who are struggling with health worries and financial issues.Children have told Childline that they have struggled to cope and their mental health has suffered as a result.It doesn#t matter how people choose to play this Childhood Day , whether it#s organising a sponsored kickabout in the park, a game of cards, a musical get-together or an online gaming tournament, we just want as many as possible playing and raising money to help us keep children safe.We look forward to hearing how your readers plan to support the NSPCC and children across Scotland this Childhood Day.To find out more and download a fundraising pack, visit www.nspcc.org.uk childhoodday or search online for NSPCC Childhood Day."},{"url":null,"title":"look out little explorers about","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

This is a big commitment for the school, requiring  hours of #on site# work.After finding out about Scottish-born American naturalist John Muir, his love for nature and his environmental work, the children mapped along their nearest beach and undertook a beach clean.Nearby, the pupils discovered a trig point and a lookout or watchtower.They are interested in finding out more about Kintyre#s lookout towers and are appealing to Courier readers with any information or stories to send them letters to: Rhunahaorine Primary School, Tayinloan, Tarbert, PA XG.Some of the children are also interested in the rocks on the beach beside the lookout tower at Rhunahaorine.They collected ious examples and took turns smashing them in the hope of finding geodes – crystals or other mineral matter – inside. They discovered lots of interesting patterns but no real geodes – this is perhaps a lelong project for some.Other pupils are interested in the shells and crabs on the beach. Crabs #body parts# are often collected and it is deemed a good finda moveable claw or leg can be worked.During one visit, the youngsters searched for shark egg cases and, after what seemed to be a fruitless hunt, more than  were found in one morning when their eyes became accustomed to what they were searching for. Their findings were submitted to the Shark Trust.Head teacher Catriona Brown told the Courier she was #very impressed# with the children#s enthusiasm and commitment throughout the project so far.Mrs Brown hopes to be able to share in the near futureany of the children achieve the award."},{"url":null,"title":"photograph of the week may 28 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Did he feel embarrassed in front of his friends who did not share his doubts, did he feel ashamed that his faith had not remained resolute or was he able to put those feelings aside and share the joy of the risen Lord We do know that Thomas responded with the words: #My Lord and my God.#More than two thousand years later, we may feel embarrassedour faith falters and doubts set in.However, we should focus on the happiness of which Jesus speaks.Have the strength and hope to echo the words of Thomas: #My Lord and my God.#Do not beat yourself up for doubting – have the strength to believe."},{"url":null,"title":"author meyrick moves into gangland territory","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

contacted back in April about an injured swan at Figgate Park.ldquoIt appeared a resident male swan, Clyde, had been in a fight with another male, resulting in a leg injury that made him unable to walk.ldquoClyde had also had bad arthritis for a number of years, which had been slowly getting worse.ldquoThis, coupled with him now being completely unable to stand, meant that he would not recover and the dficult decision was made to put him to sleep to end his suffering.She explained that Bonnie abandoned her nest about a month after losing Clyde.ldquoShe had been doing her best to incubate them but without her partner, and with her constantly being attacked by the new male, the eggs were unfortunately not viable, said Sarah.ldquoBonnie was moved to Musselburgh a couple of weeks ago and seems to be getting on well in her new environment.ldquoWe havenrsquot heardshersquos found a new mate yet but this is certainly a possibility as swans will often take up with another partner after

These animals are easily adaptable to a iety of habitats: from meadows to woods to city streets. They can also survive on a wide range of food, such as small mammals, invertebrates and fruit, but they will take advantage of food discarded by people.Foxes are social animals who live in small groups that consist of a breeding male , a femaleand their cubs. Usually, the male and female bond for le but there will be occasions when the male may seek additional mating opportunities.Mating takes place in winter and this is when foxes are most vocal. If you happen to have a window open on a winter night and you hear a loud screaming noise that sounds like a high-pitched screech, it is most definitely a fox looking for a mate and fending off its rivals.In spring, females give birth to several cubs, which become fully self-sufficient by autumn when they leave their parents. Some cubs may decide to stay with their family and they will play a big part in raising the following yearrsquos litter.My adventure with foxes started not that long ago. I was always fascinated by them but never really happened to photograph them. Occasionally, I was lucky to catch a glimpse of a fox but usually it was late in the evening or in a dense woodland, where photo opportunities are low.At the beginning of this year, I promised myself that I would find a family of foxes and get some decent shots. You may not believe it, but I spent weeks studying Google Maps in search of the best spots in East Lothian that I would visit everything marked green or looking like an open space was in scope for investigation.As spring progressed, I started to become more and more lucky with foxes. I reached the point when I could see them almost each time I left the house. I have taken multiple images, but I was never happy with them, until one dayhellipIt was a sunny Saturday morning when I decided to go out and look for deer. I visited a local meadow and quickly spotted a roe deer buck which I decided to follow. I did not manage to take any photos of the deer because as soon as I rushed after him, a beautully coloured fox crossed my path. Every day thenceforth I was coming back home with more information about the fox that I found. Finally, I was rewarded with some lovely shots in the setting sun! This is something I was dreaming of for so long! These animals are fantastic and I have completely fallen for them .Now, with lockdown eased, I hope you will have a chance to spend more time outdoors and hopefully see some lovely foxes. Evenyou donrsquot spot them on your walk, donrsquot give up! Look for some signs which may indicate of their presence: fox pooor their underground burrow .Scats are usually easily identiable as they are twisted and contain bits of fur and bones. They are deposited at prominent spots such as on footpaths, stumps, posts or rocks. The den is nothing  but a circular hollow in the groundyou are brave enough to lower yourself and snf it, you will smell a strong and unpleasant scent. Foxes secrete this smelly odour to mark their territories but it also helps to distinguish iniduals . They also have scent glands on their feet, so they mark their well-used trails as they walk ndash this is quite helpful to effectively navigate at night.If you would like to share your fox sightings with me or advise about good photography spots, please get in touch. I will also be delighted to chat anything wildle, so please do come up to say helloyou see me out and about with my camera.Speak to you next month!www.zanslenswww.facebook zanslenswww.instagram zans_lenswww zans_lens"},{"url":null,"title":"plans-lodged-crematorium-near-musselburgh","story":"East Lothian Council will now consider the project from the Westerleigh Group, a developer and operator of crematoria and cemeteries, with  facilities in England, Scotland and Wales.A single-storey crematorium, of around m internally, which would house a -seat chapel, is planned in the larger of two fields on the site.There would be a waiting room, accessible toilets, administration office, crematory, covered walkway and floral tribute area.Car parking providing  spaces, including six disabled accessible bays and an additional four spaces for staff parking, and memorial gardens are also planned.George Bell, regional manager for north and east from Westerleigh Group, said: \"There is a pressing need for a crematorium in East Lothian.\"East Lothian does not have a crematorium of their own and their residents currently have to travel long journeys into Edinburgh, through busy roads, to access a crematorium.\"The area already has a large population base and this is going to grow further in the coming years, with some signicant new housing developments being planned.\"If our planning application is successful, this new crematorium will also serve the wider Edinburgh City region.\"We pride ourselves on creating and maintaining crematoria which are welcoming, attractive places for remembrance and reflection, and which are true assets to their local communities.\"The teams at all our crematoria have proudly earned a reputation for providing exceptional care and support to local people, enabling families to remember, mourn and celebrate the lives of their loved ones in a way that is uniquely personal, and we look forward to hopefully being able to bring that same high level of service to the people of East Lothian.\"Earlier this year, we conducted a public consultation exercise and were delighted to receive a positive response.\"The full planning application has now been submitted and we hope to receive a decision in early autumn.\"The site of the proposed development is around  acres, located north of the village of Old Craighall.

Naw, no way ever, sorry aunty, your walks on this trip have been long enough!And so they set off for Rannoch Moor, which meant adrive along the old road, back through the ancient Caledonian pinewood to Bridge of Orchy.As Izzy approached the bridge, her stomach sank as she relived the events of an hour ago.When Mary had made her first desperate cry to Finn, he had thankfully just closed his door so hadnrsquot heard but Izzy had. Shersquod had no choice but to rapidly set off with music playing loudly. The heartbreaking image of Mary in her rear view mirror, begging her to stop, was something she would never forget. It made her feel sick with guilt.Izzy was now desperate to speak to Ewen, to find out why the hell his mother was there in the first place after shersquod been so clear she couldnrsquot cope with being involved. And leaving the scarf, that wasnrsquot part of the plan either.Doubts and anxiety about the trip once again surfaced in Izzyrsquos mind. It had been so carefully planned to keep Finn safe, but now it seemed to be unravelling. The incident at Bridge of Orchy had unnerved Izzy to the extent she was no longer sure she could trust Ewen to keep to the arrangements they had painstakingly put together.The more she thought about it, the more she began to realise that ending the trip and taking Finn home would be the safest thing to do.But her mind was torn in a dilemma. She could see he was enjoying and benefitting from the adventure. As shersquod hoped, the landscape, the stories and immersion in nature had created a new emotional space for Finn. The Highlands were working their magic and Finn was slowly opening up his anxiety seemed less and he was managing his anger better. His regular calls to his mum were vital to maintain this, but there were signs that this trip, as Izzy had hoped, could be a seed for healing.And, besides, Finn had already made it clear he didnrsquot want the journey cut short. If she did so now, how could she explain her decision to him  She would have to make something up and he would feel so let down, probably assume he was to blame.As Izzy drove over the bridge, her mind swirled with indecision. She reached the junction with the main road, then hesitated. Head north to Rannoch Moor, or south and take Finn home  It was late afternoon now, with perhaps three hours of daylight left.ldquoCome on aunty, there are no cars, you can go.Izzy made her decision: she turned left and headed north.A distant view of the Caledonian wood was suddenly blocked by a dense plantation of Sitka spruce by the road. Then Loch Tulla reappeared into view, its banks littered with naturersquos debris, landed there during previous flooding by the loch.Before they began their ascent to Rannoch Moor, they passed the ruined castle at Achallader. Its tower was clearly visible in the distance, a jagged tooth standing defiantly but dwarfed by the mountains beyond.It was yet another fortress built by Black Duncan, this time on land taken from the Fletchers, so the story goes, by devious means. The conniving Campbell chief engineered a deadly confrontation between one of his servants and the head of the Fletchers. The sad result was the murder of the servant by the Fletcher, all part of Black Duncanrsquos plan. It was done in the heat of the moment, but murder it was, and Fletcher would hang for itcaught and tried. Duncan ensured he himself was witness to the incident, so he had Fletcherrsquos fate in his palm. So upon Duncanrsquos advice, the Fletchers fled, leaving the land to be acquired by the cunning Campbell chief, who promptly had a tower built by the farm to mark his possession of it.ldquoJust like a dog pees on lampposts to mark his territory, commented Finn.ldquoWhat an image, but yes! laughed Izzy. ldquoAnd it guards the edge of his Campbell estate, as well as the droversrsquo route. From here, we climb up to Rannoch Moor.The road curved as it climbed to give a spectacular view over Loch Tulla and the peaks of the great wall of Rannoch, a mountain boundary on the south of the moor. Izzy had travelled this way many times, but her anticipation was undiminished: Rannoch Moor is a wild place seeped in legend and history, not a few ghosts, and an unpredictable temper.Izzy pulled up at a layby on the edge of the moor and turned to look at her nephew.ldquoWersquore going on a walk, arenrsquot we  he said despondently. He looked around. It was all empty moorland with distant mountains. ldquoWe are in the middle of nowhere, aunty, what are we going to see ldquoI will be honest, Finn, itrsquos not far but it may be boggy and wet underfoot. But itrsquos a place of special meaning for me and I really want to share it with you.He looked down at his boots, then gave her an affirmative smile.ldquoOK then, I suppose so far I havenrsquot regretted going on your lsquoshortrsquo walkshellip much!They set off onto the moor but kept not far from the road. They leapt between mounds of wispy grass and bog myrtle, trying with limited success to avoid boggy areas. Soon Finn could see what he guessed was their destination: a large boulder with a tree growing from the top of it.It was a lsquogiantrsquos stonersquo but not as large as Samsonrsquos Putting Stone. Izzy climbed to the top with an ease that suggested shersquod done it before and gave Finn a hand up. They both sat under the branches of the tree, a small weather-beaten rowan, looking out to the mountains which they had passed on their journey. Cars whizzed by on the nearby road, but soon Finn became unaware of their fleeting presence as he listened to his auntrsquos words.ldquoHow it seeded in this unlikely place, I canrsquot say, she said. ldquoPerhaps a careless bird dropped a berry and couldnrsquot retrieve it. But however the seed arrived, it sprouted and grew from this small crack on the boulderrsquos summit. This tree survives on meagre ground and in an exposed position, howling winds have bent its spines. Irsquove seen it in all seasons, resplendent with berries in autumn, battered by freezing winter gales, its naked branches turned white by frost, wearing a coat of blossom in spring. Its le here seems impossible, yet it survives. Each time I pass on tour, I slow my coach and say hello under my breath. But when I am on a personal journey, I often stop and keep it company for a while.ldquoKeep it company aunty, really ldquoItrsquos alone, Finn. Trees connect with each other just as humans do, although in dferent ways of course. They crave the company of their kind, their roots intertwine as we might give each other hugs. But this beautul tree is lonesome.ldquoI donrsquot think trees get lonely, aunty, they donrsquot have feelings like we do.Izzy bent her knees up to her chin and wrapped her arms around her legs, staying silent in thought for a moment before replying.ldquoMaybe yoursquore right, Finn, perhaps itrsquos that trees can help us recognise our own feelings. You know, when we see their struggles, they remind us of our own. They are living things too and I think they can understand.Finn peered up at the tree. A few red berries hung from its wilted branches. From a distance, it had looked defiant, but close up it looked, well, precarious perhaps even anxious, clinging onto its almost bare rock for survival. He didnrsquot want to admit it out loud, but he did understand what his aunt was saying he too could feel a connection to the rowanrsquos struggle.As they sat either side of the tree squeezed on top of the boulder, Izzy told a story. Finn wasnrsquot sureit was for him or the tree probably both, he reckoned. It was a story he would long remember, more deeply than he could have imagined he would.They walked back to the car silently, carefully re-treading their steps to avoid sinking ankle deep in bog. Midges buzzed in the air but didnrsquot bother. It was getting very cool and breezy darkening clouds were making the sky seem angry.ldquoThe mood of the moor is changing, reflected Izzy out loud. ldquoYou ready to see what lies beyond that ridge Here are the links to chapters one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, , , , ,  and ."},{"url":null,"title":"haddington-added-location-mobile-coronavirus-testing-units-east-lothian-next-week-revealed","story":"The units offer Covid- tests to those who have no symptoms of the virus.As nearly one in three people who have Covid- donrsquot show any of the usual symptoms, itrsquos possible for people to be passing the virus on to loved ones and people in the community.By getting tested ndash evensomeone feels fine and has received vaccination ndash they can find outthey are positive and take immediate action to stop the spread of the virus to others by self-isolating.A fixed testing centre, located at the former Stoneyhill Community Centre in Musselburgh, continues to operate from Tuesdays to Saturdays from am to pm.

and wellbeing issues.It has approached Scottish Government ministers with a ldquoblueprint for a healthier Scotland, and is calling on the Government to partner third-sector organisations in providing funding and informing policy making.John Cassidy, SCHW chairman, said: ldquoWersquore now up to about  dferent organisations across Scotland thatrsquos still quite small across a country, so we want to encourage other organisations to come forward and become part of SCHW.ldquoThere are two things wersquore looking for from the blueprint: one is that people come to [the Government] looking for money, and what wersquore saying is that they can find this from their current health improvement budget, they donrsquot need to find it in new money and the other is that they need to develop a new relationship with the third sector through a partnership agreement, where the Scottish Government and, through us, the third sector enter into a partnership of understanding of how we together, rather than separately, work to improve health and wellbeing across Scotland.Mr Cassidy added: ldquoA lot of the third-sector organisations are now overwhelmed because of issues that have arisen over the pandemic things like mental health issues have grown so much and, at the same time, special funding for the pandemic is slowly disappearing.The SCHW proposes to aid organisations in accessing funding and also to negotiate with the Government to maintain funding for longer than the usual one or two years.Mr Cassidy said: ldquoIf you set up a service, particularlyyoursquore helping folk with mental health issues, you canrsquot do these things in that timescale.ldquoWe need to have ongoing investment, an ongoing partnership, ensuring that third-sector organisations have that resilience and confidence so they can work with communities for a goodof time.ldquoThe way that they would invest in hospitals and doctors, they would be investing in the third-sector approach to health improvements.Mrs Northrop added: ldquoWe hope people will find out about SCHW and help us grow a voice for communities across East Lothian.To find out more about the SCHW, go to

It doesnt matter how smooth your batter, how hot and Teflonned your pan the debut is always a crumpled mess that flops sadly onto the plate.This is true whether its an English pancake destined for lemon or sugar, or, as in this case, a turmeric-spiked rice flour and coconut milk crepe, laden with plump prawns and a forest floors worth of coriander. Impaled by rogue bean sprouts and soggy rather than crisp, I have utterly massacred food writer Uyen Luus sizzling crepes. I hope she will forgive me.I order in Vietnamese food every chance I get: fragrant chicken phocoarsely shredded papaya salads golden spring rolls and enticingly translucent summer ones pork-prawn wontons with sesame and chilli oil chargrilled, fish sauce-drenched aubergines... but until now, Id never attempted to cook it myself.Why even try when the depth of flavour seems unfathomable to achieve  When every dish is so zingy and bold, fresh and sprightly  Who has such lightness of touch  Luu, thats who. And me, it turns out, when armed with Luus new recipe collection, Vietnamese.The dishes in the brilliantly blush pink cookbook are designed to \"demysty Vietnamese cooking\", promises Luu, who reckons the most common mistake people make when approaching the cuisine, is \"they think its more complicated than it is\".You cant really blame themwhen the \"flavours feel and taste complex\". However, to hit those key Vietnamese flavours - sweet, sour, salty, umami, hot and bitter - its just a matter of combining ingredients, Luu insists. Theres no need to be intimidated.I start off slow with the stir-fried greens a tangle of noodles, shards of pak choi and a sauce I didnt even have to go shopping for . It took literally  minutes to throw together, and the Thai basil I did go out and buy especially, was fully worth the trip .The ginger chicken I try next proves to be an alchemical triumph of caramelised brown sugar, chicken thighs and a hefty scattering of fresh ginger matchsticks. I grow sceptical when told to add a full teaspoon of freshly ground black pepper to the bubbling panbut am an idiot to argue. It brings warmth and depth and almost tricks you into forgetting that really, its the fish sauce you should be applauding, because thats the umami deliciousness holding everything together.We crunch through spears of asparagus and broccoli on the side, a sign of Luus insistence to make things work for you. She just species \"greens\" - whatever greens youve got will do perfectly. Hence why my dodgy first crepe is folded scrappily into shells of iceberg and baby cos lettuce, and although I have a few strands of Thai basil left, and a little coriander and mint, I bump it up with chervil from a pot on the balcony too. Greenery of all kinds welcome.We eat the lettuce-wrapped crepes in shts, dunking them in a piquant fish sauce that runs down your wrists. They get crispier and crispier as I get more patientand the pan itself gets hotter and hotter, until the crepes crackle when they hit the plate. The piles of herbs, abundance of prawns and the elegance of the fish sauce in a blue and white china bowl, make this crepe supper feel special, memorable, but also achievable. And thats the crux - Luu wants us to feel confident making these dishes,not every night of the week, at least once or twice.As a general rule, the dishes we cook at home on autopilot are the ones we grew up eating. Ask chefs, food writers and home cooks, Who taught you to cook , and we almost always invoke grandmothers, nonnas, abuelas. Being a child, having a tea towel pegged to your top and a wooden spoon put in your hand by an elder, is practically universal.They can hold the keys to our culinary heritage in a way parents - too close, too busy - tend not to. For many of us, its our grandmothers recipes we long to record, and that we miss most desperately when we realise were grown up and have our own kitchens to use. Straying outside the culinary remits of our grandmothers can be dficult.My childhood was caullower bakes, spaghetti Bolognese , Chinese takeaways on Fridaysand roasts on Sundays. My Granny made treacle tarts and elderflower cordial, bundt cakes, baked potatoes with boiled eggs, and chicken nugget bagels with peas and corn.And yet, as I prepare Luus ginger chicken, and watch long strands of spring onion curl and twist as theyre submerged in a bowl of icy water, they make me think of my Granny anyway, and how shed use scissors to turn s of shiny wrapping paper ribbons into cascading spirals.It turns out the act of learning something new, grasping unfamiliar methods and skills, or mastering a flavour combination that once seemed daunting, can make your brain turn to the person who taught you the first things, way back in the beginning.Vietnamese: Simple Vietnamese Food To Cook At Home by Uyen Luu is published by Hardie Grant, priced pound.

When the apprentices hauled him on board, they saw he was the old man whom theyrsquod seen in the chart room the night before. The captain of the wrecked boat.These are the stories that attracts Gill Russell, the artist behind the new An Lanntair exhibition named after this tale, itself found after trawling through the extensive collection on Tobar an Dualchais, the always fascinating audio archive of stories and songs and memories collected by field recorders from the School of Scottish Studies at the University of Edinburgh from Gaelic and Scots communities from the s onwards.Russell, herself based in Strathdon, yet having travelled frequently to the Western Isles since childhood, spent countless hours searching through the archive, and then, too, speakingto islanders who could tell her ofthe connections between land andthe sea in the Hebrides.Russellrsquos work is in mapping the environment, although not in an Ordnance Survey sense. She is drawn to places of signicance, whether mythological or geographical or other ndash her many collaborations with the poet artist Alec Finlay in recent years attest to this, too.There is a seeking out of stories and information, of names and places, and of how they are marked. She maps the routes of rivers from source to sea in visual veins ndash she calls them ldquotributrees. She marks the names of shipwrecks ndash in position ndash on a page without marking the islands around which they are wrecked, and gives the importance of the names to the invisible coastline on which, or off which, they foundered.She maps the near-lost names of the skerries and rocks in the Sound of Harris, now deemed obsolete by many modern mariners ndash although perhaps not all ndash who rely on satellite navigation to chart the tortuous course through the skerry-strewn passage between Leverburghand Berneraywhich would previously have been done by learned knowledge, and reading of the signposts of sea and land.ldquoItrsquos incredible because the Sound of Harris is almost more land than sea, she tells me of this last section of the project. ldquoI became fascinated by the Loch Portain ferry weaving through these rocks.Russell made what she has called a ldquoschematic amonochrome circular image made up of names and of the signals of the navigation buoys on the route. ldquoI became quite geeky about it, she laughs, ldquoI was fascinated by the way they inidually flash and what that means. I like to mix up the heritage with the modern stuff!The names themselves came from the book, The Sea Names of Berneray, by Donald McKillop, and from Cal Mac ldquomotorman Donald Maclean, interviewed extensively in the exhibition, ldquowho grew up eight metres from the high water line in Berneray and jumped on any boat going anywhere.ldquoHe knows the loch and the Sound of Harris, and how really important those names were, how essential it was to know the names of the skerries to describe how to get places, says Russell.ldquoAnd it was then I began to realise that Irsquom the spectator, the tourist, and that I needed to find the authentic voices in the aural histories.She has collected it all here, and in a book that accompanies the exhibition, a reckoning of the marine heritage of the islands, of the voices of the past and a history that is ghosted over the present.South West by South - An T-Eilean Fada, The Long Island: A Poetic Cartography, An Lanntair, Kenneth Street, Stornoway, Lewis,   lanntair, Until  July, Tues-Wed, am-pm, Thurs-Sat, am-lateCritics ChoiceMaking use of the posters for cultural events that didnt happen because of Covid last year and a hard-working shredding machine, artist Laura McGlinchey has created Paper Cave, a walk-in installation in a glass-fronted bakery art space in Ayr. Nurture Narture, itself the brainchild of father-daugther duo, Robert and Saskia Singer, during the first lockdown, has grown into an artists collective based around a bakery in the historic centre of Ayr, and McGlinchey, who first created Paper Cave during lockdown last year, has been reworking her idea in this new public space, spending the last four weeks creating the painstaking cave from scratch, fully ndash intentionally - in sight of anyone passing by.The materials themselves are gleaned from the local environment, not least with the help of the community, from paper, seaweed and cardboard to bits of plastic, shaving foam and flour. Chemical reactions amongst the ldquoingredients are part of her process of exploration into textures. The physical structure itself is built up using paper loops, layering them inch by inch before covering everything in a large amount of thickly applied paint, the layers sometimes ldquoironed together with plastic.ldquoGravity is one of the main materials that I work with, she says. ldquoIt hugely contributes to the transformative nature of the work and increases the element of chance that already comes with painting.Whilst visitors can walk in to the installation, there will also be musical events in the space, curated by McGlinchey, from actsQuiche, Grayling, Jenny Clford, Scarlett Randle and band, Adult Fun, Shredd, Craig John Davidson.Laura McGlinchey: Paper Cave, DOUGH,  Sandgate, Ayr,  , www.nartureDont miss: Le in the TimeThis online exhibitionis put together by AMINA, the Muslim Womens Resource Centre, brings together the creative work of over one hundred Muslim, Black and minority ethnic women in Scotland experiencing challenges in their lives that were made even more dficult during lockdown.

Responding to an initial written question, a Minister would read out a turgid civil service response, then subside gratefully, hoping for a y supplementary to catch his breath.Up from the Labour side would bound Tam, to declare in his sonorous Etonian tones: ldquoHow much  Or, even better: ldquoWhy  Cue startled Minister.I thought of Tam when I pondered the question of a putative co-operation deal between the SNP Scottish Government and the Greens. Recalling my journalistic coaching, I asked: ldquoWho, what, when, where, why :Now Swinney has moved on, how will we sort out Scotlandrsquos struggling schools We know who: two parties, of dferent stature, supporting independence with ying degrees of fervour.We know what: a co-operation agreement short of full coalition. Eventually, there might be Green Ministers. For now, too soon.More to the point, the Greens stress they would reserve the right to dissent on certain specied issues. Which means no collective governmental responsibility. Which means no Ministers, for now.When  The talks are said to be at an early stage with months of discussion to come. Where  Holyrood.The big question, though, is why. One observer tells me that the Green co-leaders, Patrick Harvie and Lorna Slater, seemed faintly taken aback at the initial ldquotalks about talks. Warily and sensibly, they stressed the need to consult colleagues.However, they have agreed to continue negotiating, noting en passant that they have secured concessions in recent Budget deals.There is history here. In , Alex Salmond led a minority administration. He tried to strike a partnership deal with the Liberal Democrats. That fell apart: key LibDems found the SNP and independence fundamentally unpalatable.Mr Salmond then turned to the Green MSPs. All two of them. The leader Robin Harper, with his permanent smile and Dr Who scarf. And Patrick Harvie, an astute politician even then.Again, a full partnership proved impossible, owing to a dispute over transport policy among other issues. A compact was signed to support the election of Mr Salmond as First Minister.That was not really needed: subsequent history proved that the party with the most MSPs would, in practice, be permitted by Parliament to enter office.They said they had been sold short. Mr Swinney was, to put it mildly, less than pleased. That memory no doubt lingers in the mind of the Deputy First Minister as he contemplates the new round of talks.So, again, why  Especially now, when the SNP are just one short of an overall majority in Holyrood.I sought answers from my Herald Podcast  among the number, Kezia Dugdale, who formerly led Labour and now heads the John Smith Centre. She disclosed that she had conducted extensive research, including a phone call to a pal in New Zealand, where there has been cross-party co-operation.She was advised that the Greens there felt they gained clout and influence. Labour leaders felt they gained extra security, including a pact which obviated the need for tense annual Budget talks.:Is independence inevitable or can unionists rescue the realm they cherish The deal has persisted, even though Labour won a majority last year. Some Greens are discontented.Scottish Green sources point to the New Zealand model, stressing the capacity to criticise the administration. They are less enthusiastic about the example of Ireland where some Greens fear their ideology risks being swamped in a compact with centre-right parties.Either way, it is, partly, about money. Nicola Sturgeon and Kate Forbes want to pre-empt the annual agony of Budgetary negotiations by securing potential support in advance.Not an easy sell. SNP Ministers are adamant they will stick to an income tax freeze for the duration of this Parliament. Greens favour a more radical approach to revenue, as they would see it, including a possible wealth taxa way could be found.But compromise could be reached. There will be other obstacles, such as Green opposition to road building. The FM said this week that dualling the A, for example, will not be halted.Then there is the North Sea. The parties dfer over the pace of shting away from oil and gas. With the COP  UN climate conference due in Glasgow, the SNP may be ready to give yet more ground, while protecting north-east jobs.Always, of course, there is independence. Would a compact add more impetus to the case for indyref  Not, I suspect, in terms of influencing the UK Government. But it would perhaps be a reminder of the ersity of support for independence.There is, however, a third motivation, beyond cash and indyref. The SNP have been in power for  years. The previous Holyrood session had a toxic tang: Brexit independence arguments and Nicola Sturgeon gazing fretfully over her shoulder at her ever-present predecessor.I believe the FM wants a fresh approach. Literally, a new politics. Sceptics will say this is purely about presentation. I think it is also strategic. By making a choice, by making a new alliance, Ms Sturgeon hopes to banish staleness from her own party, and simultaneously challenge rivals to refresh.She hopes, in so doing, to isolate the Tories. They respond by warning that the Greens will push her in an anti-business direction.She hopes, also, to challenge Labour, over policy and indyref. Anas Sarwar was, understandably, ill-prepared. His first response was simply to revive an old Labour theme, deriding the recreation of a spending cuts coalition.He will need a new tone, new phrases.

Cummings was part of it too. He admitted he didnrsquot advise the PM to seriously consider lockdown until it was already too late.Cummings also saved the bacon of the hapless Health Secretary, Matt Hancock, by accusing him of repeatedly lying. Boris Johnson was forced to back his Cabinet minister, thus saving him from the chop in the forthcoming cabinet reshuffle.Cummings may also have done the PM a favour by helping expose the hypocrisy of Nicola Sturgeon. Her claims to have handled the pandemic better are now sounding distinctly hollow. She can expect a flurry of compensation claims following the admission that the Scottish Government failed to protect elderly patients in care homesIt was quite a performance. No wonder Boris Johnson practically purred at Prime Ministerrsquos Questions on the day The Dom lobbed his self-destructive hand grenades. Not so much Independence Day as the Great Escape.I felt almost sorry for the dark lord as he exposed his personality disorders in what almost became an Oprah-style confessional. Cummingsrsquos most revealing moment came right at the start when he nearly broke down while delivering an apology to those who died needlessly. He is clearly a troubled man.But he squandered it all by a display of arrogance, ignorance, pettiness, vanity, malevolence. Of unreliability and disloyalty ndash not just to Boris Johnson, who stood by him over Barnard Castle, but to the civil servants, scientists, ministers whose trust he betrayed to no good purpose.It is fine to be a whistleblower ndash provided you know how to blow it.In more competent hands Cummingsrsquos evidence, especially about Johnsonrsquos dithering over the second lockdown last autumn, might have done real damage. But his accusations either missed their target or rebounded. Not least when Cummings declared that everyone at a senior level in government was ldquocrackers ndash including himself.The main charge against Boris Johnson has always been that the PM was reckless, uncaring and throughout the pandemic, putting the interests of the economy above human lives. That he wilfully ignored scientic advice and thought we should just ldquotake it on the chin. Cummings made clear that, on the contrary, Johnsonrsquos failings were a reflection of a dysal civil service run by amateurs and by a scientic community which was fighting the wrong pandemic. It was chaos, from top to bottom. Whitehall said it had a plan but didnrsquot. The Governmentrsquos scientic advisers thought they were dealing with flu. No-one ndash Cummings included ndash advised the PM to take any serious action, such as quarantine and closing the borders, until mid-March. Even then the borders were not closed for fear it would look ldquoracist. Large gatherings like Cheltenham were allowed to continue.In hindsight, Johnsonrsquos scientic advisers should have learned from the prompt action taken by some Asian countries like South Korea that had experienced the Sars and Mers outbreaks. But the point was: they didnrsquot. Cummings underlined that international agencies ndash like the World Health Organisation and the US Centres for Disease Control ndash were also slow off the mark.Even after the pandemic was recognised as such in March , the consensus on the Scientic Advisory Group on Emergenciesand in Whitehall was that, in the absence of a vaccine, the disease had to be allowed to ldquowork its way through the population until herd immunity was achieved. The aim, as Cummings explained it, was to seek immunity by the autumn, to avoid a second wave in winter.This was all wrong, of course. Coronavirus was much more contagious and lethal than flu. But Cummings portrayed this as a collective failure that could not solely be laid at the door of the PM however ldquounfit he thought he was was for office. He even quoted the Cabinet Secretary at the time, Mark Sedwill, advocating a Covid version of ldquochickenpox parties to help spread immunity.Cummings should have pleaded the Fth because he then incriminated himself. In January and February , he did nothing. He didnrsquot even attend Cobra meetings, didnrsquot advise lockdown, didnrsquot even discuss what lockdown meant seriously until that infamous ldquoIndependence Day meeting on March  in Downing Street. That was when his whiteboard told him disaster was imminent and that the PM needed a ldquoPlan B. Unfortunately, the then-Deputy Cabinet Secretary Helen McNamara burst in saying ldquotherersquos no planndash wersquore absolutely f****d.The next day, March , Cummings still did not call on the PM to impose a full Wuhan-style lockdown. He was just ldquotoo scared that I might be wrong. Anyway, he said, SAGE ldquohad not modelled any kind of lockdown because it was still labouring under the logic of herd immunity.Yetthere was no Plan B, who might be thought to be at least partly responsible for that,not the most influential adviser in government: Dominic Cummings  He had even blogged about the dangers of coronavirus pandemics before entering government.I ended up agreeing with Boris Johnson: chaos would indeed be better than putting this monomaniac in charge of anything. Cummings even said that, given his choice, he would have put a ldquodictator in charge of the pandemic.It doesnrsquot take a genius now to forecast what the official inquiry is going to say whenever it reports. There was a systemic failure to plan going back several administrations. The scientic advisers, and Whitehall, failed to appreciate just how deadly Covid- was. The Prime Ministerrsquos advisers, from Cummings down, failed to alert him until it was too late. Lessons will be learned etc.Prime ministers are not scientists, they rely on advice from civil servants, special advisers and medical experts. Cummings even distanced Johnson from the most serious scandal of all: the deaths of some , care home residents. Cummings pinned that on Matt Hancock who, he said, lied about testing elderly patients before they were decanted from acute wards. Hancock says he didnrsquot promise anything of the sort.Nicola Sturgeon may regret jumping on the Cummings bandwagon and accusing Johnson of being responsible for ldquoloss of le. Some , old people were decanted from Scottish hospitals during the first wave, many without a test. Compensation lawyers are already sharpening their writs.As this column has pointed out before, the Scottish Government made all the same mistakes ndash it did not lock down early enough, halted community testing, neglected care homes. The Scottish excess death rate is one of the worst in Europe. Ms Sturgeon accused Johnson of failing to impose a circuit-breaker lockdown in the autumn. But she didnrsquot impose a full lockdown then either.Perhaps she now needs a Cummings figure to help spread the blame.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

A post-mortem said ldquothere was no indication of violence, with the coroner adding: ldquoI am compelled to the finding that death resulted from poison.And so the mystery took hold The coroner believed the body had been taken to the beach after death and amid intense public interest, rumours swirled the man was everything from a jilted lover to a Cold War Spy as aspects of the case sparked further intrigue. These included the discovery of a suitcase checked into a railway station cloakroom containing clothing with labels removed, all bar three items that had the name \"Keane\" or ldquoKean.

They included one for a woman who lived near the beach who said she once owned a copy of the book. Police showed her a plaster cast bust of the dead mans head to aid identication and although she denied knowing him, a detective described her as ldquoevasive.Whatrsquos happening now As the years passed and police failed to identy the man, Australian authorities branded the case an \"unparalleled mystery. Now, though, his body has been exhumed and taken into the care of forensic scientists who are embarking on an effort to recover his DNA, amid hope that new techniques could finally offer a breakthrough in the case.Itrsquos part of a wider effort The case is part of Operation Persevere which aims to put a name to all unidentied human remains in South Australia, running in tandem with ldquoOperation Persist where cold case homicides are actively investigated.

I got into a discussion with a colleague about something or other when he referred to me as ldquoProtestant. Really  Was I  Was I ldquoProtestant  I realised even at the time that Protestantism is about more than religion, but I am the son of two atheists and Irsquom not religious and I never went to church. Basically, it had never occurred to me that I was Protestant and Irsquod never once referred to myself, or thought of myself, that way.:SNP in turmoil after Indy taskforce chief quits worst job ever and malcontent treasurer resignsAndyet, as far as my colleague, and others, was concerned, I was ldquoProtestant ndash something I said, or did, had given me away ndash and, whatrsquos more, my colleague was annoyed with me for not behaving like one. He found out that friends of mine had invited me to a football game and that Irsquod gone, sitting with them in the Celtic end. As far as the colleague was concerned, this was bewildering and treacherous. I told him I would happily come and sit with him for a Rangers game too. But no. The damage was done.I realise part of the problem here is that I was a naiumlve young man coming from a city where religious sectarianism pretty much didnrsquot matter to a city where it mattered a lot. But even so, it struck me at the time that you do not always know how yoursquore seen, and that you can be walking around for a long time without noticing the labels on you. Itrsquos like that game people play at parties, the one where you stick a piece of paper on your forehead and try to guess what it says: other people can read it, but you canrsquot.The sad thing is I think a similar trend has been emerging more recently in a related but dferent way. Until  or so, I would never have considered myself ldquounionist. Part of the reason for that was the SNP were nowhere politically and the constitution, although it was discussed, was not a pressing issue. Also, most of us had not been forced to take sides and werenrsquot really thinking about the labels that might be stuck to us.The referendum in  changed that and, more rapidly and violently that I would have expected, we started to attach the labels ldquounionist or ldquonationalist to each other. It applied all over Scotland and in certain places, like Glasgow, ldquounionist and ldquoprotestant were conflated. Of course, the rule is not universal ndash I have friends from a Catholic background who voted No and friends from a Protestant background who voted Yes ndash but the point is: the labels were there and there was only a choice of two: Yes or No. Choose your side  Right, thatrsquos it: yoursquore a unionist or youre a nationalist.Some of you may think all of this is a bit rich coming from me and that Irsquom part of the problem with my ldquounionist columns and certainly I think we are now prone to look at every issue through Yes and No telescopes. Take the recent meeting between Gordon Brown and Prince William for example. Yoursquore likely to make a judgement about it depending on whether yoursquore a ldquounionist or a ldquonationalist. Perhaps you see it as the latest attempt to hold back the worrying rise of the SNP perhaps you see it as royals plotting with unionists. Check the label on your forehead for the answer.The recent argument over the statue of William III in Glasgow is also interesting in this respect. The statue has been vandalised a few times and in the most recent incident the horsersquos tail was broken off. In a statement, the Orange Order said it was yet another anti-Protestant attack and that all things Protestant and Unionist were being demonised in Scotland. ldquoWith recent rhetoric by the usual political rent a quotes and the accompanying media frenzy, it said, ldquoGrand Lodge is hardly surprised that such mindless actions have happened.:Independence: Does Sturgeon have the guts to make changes in the SNP, evenit means telling her husband that itrsquos time to move on The reaction of the Order goes back a long, long way ndash which is part of the problem ndash but my worry is their binary outlook is no longer as unusual as it once was. The Orange Order see the world as unionist and non-unionist and, instead of that approach fading into the past ndash as we might expect and hope ndash there are more Scots who now see the world this way, with or without the added ision of Catholic and Protestant. In other words, evenyou reject the idea of the \"Ulsterisation\" of Scotland - and Scotland and Northern Ireland are dferent places, of course they are -the idea of a society ided into two camps is now much more familiar to Scots than it would have been  years ago.The fact that wersquove seen this happen over the last few years is utterly depressing to me. Perhaps it is a perverse comfort to some that the isions that exist in Scotland are not unique and that politics is more ided along identity lines around the world . And, in some ways, Scotland has become a more erse and more tolerant place.However, in other ways,were being honest, Scotland has become distinctly less tolerant, particularlyyou belong to the ldquoother camp and the label on your forehead says the wrong thing. And my worry is that, now we think in these terms, the labels will never disappear. As long as Scotland remains in the UK, we are all either unionist or nationalist, and evenwe do become independent, the resentments associated with the labels are unlikely to go away. Because labels stick.All we can do, I suppose, is try to resist as much as we can. In the years that Irsquove been writing this column, Irsquove been called pretty much everything: unionist, Tory, right-wing, ldquowoke, SNP hater, SNP spy, and someone even speculated about whether I used to be a member of the Socialist Workersrsquo Party . The point is some of the labels are laughable and some are just wrong but none of them is entirely accurate because simplistic labels rarely reflect the details of who we are and what we think. I do not want to be a label. I do not want to be this or that. I do not want to be a unionist any more.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

This includes an ambition to ensure this unique area is managed and maintained with a sustainable long-term plan which enhances and protects this for the benefit of future generations.The vision honours Glasgowrsquos international standing during the industrial age. Its success in global trading, and its rapid growth relied on safe, clean drinking water for its citizens. Loch Katrine was identied as the source of this, and Milngavie Reservoirs established as a strategic base, coupled with serving as a public park for local communities and day-trippers alike.As volunteers, the Friends of Milngavie Reservoir greatly value working in collaboration with local groups and national bodies, such as Scottish Water, which owns and manages the area. The vision statement sets out our five strategic priorities: Heritage, Visitor Access, Community and Partnership, Bioersity and Green Conservation and Health and Wellbeing.In terms of heritage, the qualities of Milngavie Reservoirs are recognised by its many designations: Conservation Area, A-listed building and Inventory of Historic Garden and Designed Landscapes. We work with Historic Environment Scotland, East Dunbartonshire Council and Scottish Water to ensure this valuable national historic asset is expertly cared for and safeguarded for future. We will continue to advocate appropriate restoration and maintenance of the reservoirs, and their associated designed and engineered structures, and ensure the deterioration of masonry and metalwork is reversed.There has been a noticeable increase in visitor numbers during the pandemic. Our number one priority is to improve the path network and to make this fit for purpose. We want to improve access for disabled visitors and to enhance their experience, and that of others, including through new interpretation to support education and learning.Community partnership is central to our vision and we will work closely with local networks and represent their interests. We are also committed to creating more volunteering opportunities and to support community interests expressed through formal public consultation.In line with the Scottish Governmentrsquos Climate Change Plan, we will improve bioersity by means of native planting, adjusted maintenance regimes and use of wild flora mixes. In turn, we hope to protect and ersy the existing wildle. We will also establish a soft landscape management plan and secure funding for new native tree planting.Access to open green space for health and wellbeing has never been more important and our new vision recognises this at this crucial time for the recovery of communities. Volunteering can be a catalyst for social good, so what better time to celebrate this  You can find out more at www.fomr.uk and www.volunteerscotland.net.Arvind Salwan is a volunteer member, Friends of Milngavie Reservoir"},{"url":null,"title":"neil-mackay-five-key-truths-now-know-scotland-union","story":"But there are little areas of agreement we can settle upon whether wersquore pro or anti-independence, and itrsquos important to try to establish this common groundwersquore to engage in any meaningful discussion about Scotlandrsquos constitutional future. Without some trusted points on the map, wersquoll be lost in a confusion of our own making.There seems to be five areas of agreement starting to establish themselves. They appear to break down as follows:, Tory \"disrespect\" has fuelled independence supportThe word \"disrespect\" will likely alienate those of unionist bent, but itrsquos dficult to argue that Brexit, and the lack of consideration for the majority of Scottish public opinion, wasnrsquot a smack in the face. The Union is meant to be a matter of consent, not coercion.To save unionist supporters taking offence at the word \"disrespect\", letrsquos say instead that the Tory Government \"failed to consider and act upon\" the majority of Scottish public opinion. A wrong can be done passively as well as actively. Negligence can be wounding.Couple this disrespect ndash negligenceyou prefer ndash with the dismissal by Boris Johnsonrsquos Government of the Scottish election presenting a democratic mandate for a second referendum and the sense that Scotland is being \"controlled\" against its will becomes ever greater., The case for independence needs remadeIf we accept that Mr Johnsonrsquos Government has changed the nature of the Union from consent to control, and that a mandate for a second referendum exists, then surely there should be a refreshed independence prospectus. The case for independence hasnrsquot been adequately updated since Brexit.Brexit clearly increased independence support but it also changed the nature of what independence means. Before Brexit, there was no question of a hard border with England, now that prospect is real.: SNP must tell Scotland what independence meansNor has the economic case been improved. Support may hover around  per cent but in the polling stations much of that support could evaporatethe Yes movement ndash and the SNP in particular, given itrsquos effectively subsumed much of the Yes movement ndash doesnrsquot address hard economics. Currency, the cost of separation, the isions of the marital assets and debts, pensions, EU re-entry and the euro ndash the list of unanswered economic questions goes on.While itrsquos the economy which will make up most peoplersquos minds, the other great unanswered questions hover like Banquorsquos ghost too: Nato, Trident, the military, the intelligence services.The SNPrsquos \"independence taskforce\" is shambolic. Established with the intention of \"firing up\" the Yes movement, itrsquos a Potemkin village. The taskforce head, former SNP minister Marco Biagi, has quit, reportedly because the role was the ldquoworst job ever. The SNP remains riven with toxic internal feuds ndash more proof,it were needed, that entrusting a project like independence to one self-interested political party is both dangerous and absurd., If independence fails again, it fails foreverTherersquos a sense that Mr Johnson will relent at some point ndash probably when he sees Yes sliding in the polls ndash and grant a referendum. If he does, andthe case for independence hasnrsquot been well made, especially amid such clear goading by Mr Johnsonrsquos administration, then itrsquos all over for at least a generation. Veteran SNP MP Pete Wishart warned much the same at the weekend. If the Yes movement fights and loses indyref, independence will retreat to the sidelines, becoming a minority sport. Thatrsquoll spell disaster for the SNP ndash what would be the point of the party any longer  Nor could the SNP continue to use its constant sleight of hand to distract voters from its many failings in office by pointing at wicked Westminster., Le inside this \"new\" Union will be toughWhether or not another referendum is fought and lost by the Yes movement, itrsquos clear Scotland faces le inside a very dferent Union. If we agree that London is now exercising much less consideration towards \"Scottish views\", then that will only ramp up in the wake of a failed indyref. Holyrood will increasingly be told what to do, or perhaps more what not to do.Therersquos a hint of that tougher future in the looming Supreme Court hearings over whether Scotland has the authority to issue certain types of legislation. Two bills, incorporating the UN Rights of the Child and the European Charter of Local Self-Government, are to be scrutinised in court over whether they overreach Holyroodrsquos powers. The UK Government has also \"ordered\" Scotland to inform London of all contact with the EU. Expect more of the same., The Tory Government will get nasty with ScotlandMr Johnson isnrsquot going to be gentle with Scotland. Hersquos not David Cameron. Mr Johnsonrsquos \"muscular unionism\" intends to put Scotland in its place. The English electorate, broadly, and Tory voters in particular arenrsquot in an especially loving mood towards Scotland. They probably want to see a little hardball with Edinburgh.If a second referendum does materialise, then discussions over the shape of that vote wonrsquot be the cosy chit-chat that lead up to , theyrsquoll be brutal. If a Yes vote happened, prepare for horror-show negotiations as the UK tries to hammer Scotland into submission.So le either in or out of the Union will become very dferent politically from what wersquove known.: Indyref refusal will sign the death warrant of the UnionHere then are perhaps a few points on the map we can agree on: Mr Johnsonrsquos new-style Tory Party has driven support for independence, yet the case for independence has been insufficiently made and needs updating. If we do get another referendum and therersquos a No vote, itrsquos all over probably for a generation. No matter what happens in terms of Scotlandrsquos constitutional future with England, the relationship with London has changed from one of consent to control, and it looks certain Westminster will be much tougher with Scotland than before.Itrsquos not much of a map ndash butwe agree on those points, we can at least try to navigate our way towards the future in a meaningful, informed fashion.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

She wrote detailing her hopes for the future but was murdered by Serb soldiers just three days later at the age of .Visitors will also be able to see a diary kept by -year-old Zlata Filipovi# as she grew up in the war, recounting the terror and confusion of war from a childrsquos perspective.A United Nations cap belonging to Robert McNeil, a forensic technician from Glasgow who was part of a team of experts that uncovered the mass graves, will also be on display.Mr McNeil, now an ambassador of Remembering Srebrenica UK, said: ldquoThe UN cap was given to me when I first arrived in Bosnia in .ldquoI wore it throughout my numerous deployments to Bosnia, particularly to Srebrenica and then to Kosovo, and I hang on to it because itrsquos a constant reminder of the work I was engaged with out there.ldquoItrsquos wonderful that Kelvingrove has facilitated this exhibition.ldquoIt will mean so much to the Bosnian population, not only in Scotland but throughout the world.ldquoItrsquos a forgotten war in a lot of ways, and itrsquos a reminder of the genocide that happened there.The exhibition opened on Monday to mark White Armband Day, which remembers the campaign of ethnic cleansing that took place in the town of Prijedor, northern Bosnia-Herzegovina.The Serb war time authorities ordered non-Serbs to mark themselves and their homes with white armbands and sheets. Thousands were forced from their homes, interned in camps and many were killed, including children.The event will run until November .Remembering Srebrenica Scotland has organised nearly  delegations to Srebrenica since it was established in , with participants including First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and MSPs from all parties.The charity aims to bring communities together to remember Srebrenica through organising commemoration events and developing education resources for use in Scottish schools."},{"url":null,"title":"uzma-mir-celebrating-parents-instead-queuing-drive-through-covid-test","story":"But, wait a minute, was it not this time last year that we were all thinking about what foreign holidays wersquod be going on in August, and then finding out from a SAGE report that foreign travel was a signicant contributor to the second wave of coronavirus in this country  Why donrsquot we learn from our mistakes So doggedly determined are some people to get their long overdue slice of sun, sand, sea, and sangria that one third of those questioned in a survey by ITVrsquos Good Morning Britain this week said they are going to ignore government guidelines to quarantine onfrom an amber list holiday destination.I mean, when there are hundreds of planes flying in and out of amber list countries why would these people think there was a problem The initial UK Government stance on amber list countries was unclear. George Eustice, the Environment Secretary, had said the reason why planes were still flying to and from amber list countries was in case people had to visit family and friends. The later clarication by the Prime Minister that amber list countries were not for holidaymakers clearly didnrsquot make a huge impression.So, encouraged by the Governmentrsquos mixed messages and reports of the success of the vaccination programme, our intrepid travellers plan to venture forth to countries like Spain and Greece to find some new iants and come back bearing gts for all.More transmissible iants are appearing, with a new strain reportedly found last week in Vietnam that combines the characteristics of the iant first found in India and the iant first found in Kent. As an only half-vaccinated person, with at least two friends whorsquove had one jag and now have Covid, this foreign holiday extremism is a bit lost on me. Is it really worth it Although I love a bit of independent travel to far-flung places that donrsquot have British bars, I have no interest at all in one or two weeks of lounging on a beach, blistering under the sun, constantly applying and reapplying sunscreen to over-tired toddlers, particularlyit means queuing round the block for Covid tests, wearing masks on the promenade and waiting up to  hours in the airport arrivals area alongside fellow travellers from God knows where.I mean, how desperate does one have to be  Why are we so obsessed with the notion of travelling abroad when the risks are so obvious  Why has travelling abroad become a sort of God given right rather than a special privilege  And why is there so much confusion around government policy on this issue For those who are planning to ignore the rules they obviously didnrsquot get the memo about keeping their wider communities safe. Either that or they donrsquot care. They know that infection rates in some of the countries on the amber list are still high but somehow them getting their annual break in the sun is more of a priority.As Irsquom writing that last sentence, my -year-old son phones to say two of his friends have tested positive for Covid- and he was with them watching football on Saturday night. Theyrsquod been so careful for so many months, not seeing each other except through the prism of the internet. They let their guard down, they relaxed because the vaccination roll-out was going well, they were bored and exhausted by lockdown and needed respite.They had stopped thinking about their communities and more about themselves. This is how the virus continues to thrive ndash our idiotic behaviour and a refusal to learn from what we already know.When he comes home, Irsquoll make him do a test in the back garden. But even the Governmentrsquos easy-to-get-hold-of tests have made us take more risks. They give us a  sense of security. We wave away risk. lsquoAch, Irsquoll do a test.rsquoAnd we will do our test ndash after wandering about for days asymptomatically. How many will we have infected by the time we do our test  Itrsquos the same with holidays. lsquoWhy should I quarantine when I come back from an amber list countryIrsquove done a test and itrsquos negative rsquo We seek loopholes and exceptions, we expertly re-interpret the rules to suit ourselves.I feel utterly scunnered now. Today was the day our family was to celebrate a two-week delayed Eid. Our new clothes are hanging up pressed and resplendent, desert chilling in my fridge.My mum, having spent two days cooking, will get a phone call from me an hour before we are due to arrive to say that we wont be there. Even though she and dad are fully vaccinated, I could not take the risk with them or other family members.Theyrsquoll all sit out in the sun-drenched garden tonight eating roast lamb, pilau rice, chicken tikka and spinach curry as the planes continue to fly overhead.

If they want to concentrate these during the summer holidays, then we might have to look for an alternative location for the showthere is too much work going on at the site.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/PORTREE-ISLE-OF-SKYE.jpg","title":"investment plan for skye consultation to launch in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe consultation, which takes account of feedback gathered at previous events in January, will be launched in early June.Residents and businesses are being encouraged to join workshops and complete an online questionnaire to form the Skye and Raasay Investment Plan.It aims to build upon a wide range of priorities and projects including new and improved public amenities, community facilities and transport.

Credit: PSNIClaire McNeillyTwitterEmailMay   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailA Belfast filmmaker is working on a series of new documentaries about female murder victims in Northern Ireland, starting with the case of Inga Maria Hauser.Brendan Byrne has spoken to members of the tragic German backpacker#s family for the first film, which should be finished at the end of this year.It coincides with the Hauser family#s written request for a public inquest into the -year-old student#s brutal  murder.Read MorePolice told Inga’s family of her murder over the phoneRevealed: Final photo taken by Inga Maria Hauser before she was killedMr Byrne, who recently travelled to Inga Maria’s native Munich, told the Belfastthe documentary features a compelling interview with her sister Friederike Leibel, as well as contributions from friends.“Friederike had never been on camera before and she’d never really spoken about what happened in  years,” he said.“She gave a strong interview. It’s clear to see the damage and the impact her sister’s murder has had on her entire le.”Inga Maria was last seen alive on a Larne-bound ferry in April . Her battered body was found in Ballypatrick Forest near Ballycastle, Co Antrim, two weeks later.Despite numerous pleas for people with any information to come forward, the crime remains unsolved. Brendan said it was vitally important for him to visit Germany in order to build a portrait of the victim of one of our most notorious murders.“What we hear about Inga Maria Hauser is largely what happened to her here,” he said.“For this film, the Munich side of the story tells us who she was, where she came from, what sort of a personality she had, what impact the murder had on her family and friends.“This documentary fills in a lot of gaps and she becomes a person rather than just a name and a picture in a newspaper.”He added: “It’s not a current affairs programme or an investigative-style documentary. There’s no voiceover journalist. Its purpose is not necessarily to solve the case it’s to put as many elements of the case, including a portrait of Inga and her friends and family, into the most comprehensive body of work thus far seen on her tragic le and death.”Mr Byrne revealed he filmed two of Inga Maria’s close friends, Christoph Rohrer and Walter Schreiner. They hadn’t seen each other for  years and were meeting up for the first time since she left Germany.“Their meeting was very emotional,” he said.“Their lives have gone in dferent directions, so they’re really joined by nothing more than memories of Inga Maria. Her legacy has continued to cast a long shadow down through the decades.”Christoph’s mother, who had become very friendly with Almut Hauser following her daughter’s murder, gave an interview to Brendan.His we Eva, who attended Inga Maria’s school but was two years younger, also had a story she’d never told before on camera.“She recalled how the headmaster announced to the entire school over the Tannoy system about Inga Maria’s disappearance and murder,” he said.“She said it had struck fear and trepidation into the hearts of all the young people in school, who, like Inga, had hopes and dreams of travelling the world.”This is a joint project between his company Cyprus Avenue Films and Fine Point Films.It’s one of four one-hour documentaries in a series called Murder In The Badlands for BBC Northern Ireland.Filming should be wrapped up by the end of this year and it should hit our screens next January.Mr Byrne said he and Trevor Birnie “dreamt up” the idea for the series and pitched it to the BBC during lockdown.“There’s been a proleration of success in ‘true crime’ drama, particularly with Netflix and Amazon,” said the -year-old father-of-three.“In our series the joining thread is four women, four dferent decades of the Troubles, four unsolved murders, four unresolved cases.“The underlying themes were to look at the vulnerability of women in society and violence against women in general.“It’s not a feminist series but it’s very much trying to be seen through a feminine lens and to appreciate those gender distinctions within the film.“There was a conflict going on in  when Inga Maria was murdered. There was probably already a sense of male-dominated society the rape crisis centres hadn’t long been established and there was a lot of unreported violence against women outside of the conflict.All four stories have much connective tissue with regard to that.”He can’t help but hope the film helps bring justice for Inga Maria.“I hope it keeps a level of oxygen around the story — that those who have got most to hide from it disappearing still feel under pressure and those who have information that could really crack this case could come forward,” he said.“That’s not an expectation… just a hope.”.app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Most ReadDeath of Paul McKeown , discharged with ruptured appendix from Antrim Hospital, was ‘preventable’, inquest toldWatch: Police vehicle involved in serious collision in east BelfastPortstewart fire on Bank Holiday Monday damages business premisesBBC presenter Andrew Marr slammed for ‘poor research’ on NI ProtocolEdwin Poots braced for a raft of resignations as DUP implodesTop Videos\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news eda .ece AUTOCROP wh bedcfbdaceccff.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news eda .ece AUTOCROP wh bedcfbdaceccff.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayPolice car involved in east Belfast crashPlayArlene Foster says election intimidation from UDA #quite shocking#Play graves damaged in Newtownabbey cemetery Latest Northern IrelandMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Confirmed Covid cases in your area and seven day rolling averageI will only unveil ministerial line-up when I am ready – Edwin PootsNorthern Ireland traffic alerts: Several roads closed after road traffic collisionsDUP’s Poots makes party changes but defers Executive reshuffleBrandon Lewis calls for ‘stable Stormont’ to emerge in weeks aheadLatestMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Confirmed Covid cases in your area and seven day rolling averageRobert Page taking cautious approach with Aaron Ramsey, Joe Allen and Ben DaviesPhil Jagielka among senior quartet released by Sheffield UnitedLockdown to ease across most of Scotland but some areas retain tougher measuresWhy Liverpool#s latest links with a move for Philippe Coutinho have one big missing ingredient,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

There is no point in setting up a traffic light system‘green’ still requires additional measures that signicantly add to the cost of a family trip,” he said.“There is no justication for the UK Government to delay the removal of all travel restrictions for those who have been fully vaccinated when research from Public Health England has demonstrated that two doses of the Covid- vaccines are highly effective against the Indian iant.“We look forward to seeing all of Europe open to restriction-free travel for British families this summer, and to welcoming millions of British guests on board very soon”..app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Most ReadDeath of Paul McKeown , discharged with ruptured appendix from Antrim Hospital, was ‘preventable’, inquest toldWatch: Police vehicle involved in serious collision in east BelfastPortstewart fire on Bank Holiday Monday damages business premisesBBC presenter Andrew Marr slammed for ‘poor research’ on NI ProtocolEdwin Poots braced for a raft of resignations as DUP implodesTop Videos\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news eda .ece AUTOCROP wh bedcfbdaceccff.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news eda .ece AUTOCROP wh bedcfbdaceccff.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayPolice car involved in east Belfast crashPlayArlene Foster says election intimidation from UDA #quite shocking#Play graves damaged in Newtownabbey cemetery Latest Northern IrelandMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Confirmed Covid cases in your area and seven day rolling averageI will only unveil ministerial line-up when I am ready – Edwin PootsNorthern Ireland traffic alerts: Several roads closed after road traffic collisionsDUP’s Poots makes party changes but defers Executive reshuffleBrandon Lewis calls for ‘stable Stormont’ to emerge in weeks aheadLatestMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Confirmed Covid cases in your area and seven day rolling averageLockdown to ease across most of Scotland but some areas retain tougher measuresWhy Liverpool#s latest links with a move for Philippe Coutinho have one big missing ingredientStuart Broad named England vice-captain for first Test against New ZealandSteve Clarke confident of no further Covid scares despite John Fleck positive,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Photo: Rebecca Black PA WireRodney EdwardsTwitterEmailMay   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailNew Democratic Unionist Partyleader Edwin Poots is facing a string of resignations as Northern Ireland’s largest party continues to implode.It is understood a number of DUP members, including elected representatives, will quit the party this week as the fallout over the ousting of former leader Arlene Foster intensies. “I will be resigning this week and there will be others too,” said one elected representative.Read MoreCops probe ‘text threat’ to DUP man whose brother was UDA victim     :OpinionThe weekly political spin: Popcorn at the ready, DUP ision and SDLP Skywalker It comes as the Police Service of Northern Irelandinvestigates allegations the Ulster Defence Association , an illegal loyalist group, issued sinister threats to a leadership contender’s campaign team in a bid to thwart the result.Jeffrey Donaldson, a Lagan Valley MP, made the claim as Mr Poots was being ratied as leader during a “fractious”, private DUP meeting in Belfast last week.One party member who was in attendance accepted there can be “legitimate lobbying” by loyalists, “but what Jeffrey was referring to was not ambiguous in any way”. It’s understood the basis of some of the complaints revolve around “intimidating and threatening” messages sent to senior members of the DUP who are close to Mr Donaldson.According to sources, the words “you’re next” were among the alleged threats directed at members of Donaldson’s team, while other exchanges were made on the phone and email.A PSNI spokeswoman said: “Police have received a complaint that a number of members of a political party had been threatened during a recent leadership campaign.”The Sunday Independent previously reported how the UDA’s “shadowy figures” had deployed bully-boy tactics by threatening DUP members to sign a letter of no confidence in Ms Foster.It was claimed that several loyalists helped to enlist support by “reminding” some MLAs thatthey did not sign the motion, their seats at next year’s Assembly election would be in jeopardy.During Mr Poots’ acceptance speech several prominent DUP members, including Mr Donaldson and Diane Dodds left the meeting on Thursday night.In a further twist, Ms Foster’s close friend and colleague in her Fermanagh and South Tyrone constituency, Paul Bell, dramatically resigned from the party after Mr Poots’ ratication.Mr Bell warned the DUP will lose “thousands of votes” over the recent course of events.“We cannot go round the doors, the people in Fermanagh and South Tyrone will vote for anyone but the DUP. That is because, not of an election, but because of what took place before the election,” he said.A party ided, a police probe and several resignations within the next week are not the only issues Poots must deal with.His choice of first minister and how he responds to outstanding issues such as the implementation of Irish language legislation and the Northern Ireland protocol will be watched closely by Sinn Féin, his partners in government.Read MoreGail Walker:OpinionWhy Poots’ and Paisley’s Back to the Future strategy casts a shadow over not just the DUP but the Union“It’s important to remember the majority of parties and ministers in the Executive do not support his position,” a Sinn Féin source said.The source said the party has not ruled out refusing to nominate a deputy first minister after Poots’ proposes Ms Foster’s replacement, who is believed to be former communities minister Paul Givan.He is partly blamed for the collapse of the devolved institutions four years ago, when he and his officials cut funding for an Irish language initiative and forced an early election.“I am hearing September mooted for a potential election,” said another source.In Dublin, Mr Poots’ first few weeks will be watched closely by Taoiseach Micheál Martin, who is expected to speak to the DUP leader about the contentious issue of the protocol.Speaking after his election as leader, Mr Poots claimed relationships between Belfast and Dublin “are really, really bad”.Meanwhile, the British-Irish Council will take place in Co Fermanagh next month, where Mr Martin, along with the UK government’s Michael Gove and Scotland’s Nicola Sturgeon, will meet with leaders from Wales, Guernsey, the Isle of Man, Jersey and Northern Ireland.However, who will be leading Stormont remains to be seen as Ms Foster, who is still first minister, has threatened to quit this Tuesday — weeks earlier than planned —Mr Poots names her successor..app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Most ReadDeath of Paul McKeown , discharged with ruptured appendix from Antrim Hospital, was ‘preventable’, inquest toldWatch: Police vehicle involved in serious collision in east BelfastPortstewart fire on Bank Holiday Monday damages business premisesBBC presenter Andrew Marr slammed for ‘poor research’ on NI ProtocolEdwin Poots braced for a raft of resignations as DUP implodesTop Videos\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news eda .ece AUTOCROP wh bedcfbdaceccff.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news eda .ece AUTOCROP wh bedcfbdaceccff.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayPolice car involved in east Belfast crashPlayArlene Foster says election intimidation from UDA #quite shocking#Play graves damaged in Newtownabbey cemetery Latest PoliticsDUP’s Poots makes party changes but defers Executive reshuffleBrexit: EU ambassador accuses DUP’s Poots of lacking ‘adherence to reality’ over NI ProtocolDUP leader Edwin Poots expected to reveal new ministerial team with ‘surprise’ a possibility as need for olive branch to Donaldson campUUP leader Doug Beattie warns DUP and Sinn Fein against collapsing StormontUlster Unionists more appealing than DUP, claims young loyalist who warned of possible violence over NI Protocol LatestMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Confirmed Covid cases in your area and seven day rolling averageWhy Liverpool#s latest links with a move for Philippe Coutinho have one big missing ingredientStuart Broad named England vice-captain for first Test against New ZealandSteve Clarke confident of no further Covid scares despite John Fleck positivePrime Minister took short break after wedding, No  confirms,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueArlene Foster and Michelle O#Neill at the Strand Arts Centre.May   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailFrom the DUP in turmoil to MLAs needing Yoda#s wisdom, Andrew Madden and Gareth Cross take a closer look at some of the more unusual things in the Assembly and further afield this week.Monday: Outgoing First Minister Arlene Foster forgot her worries on Monday, with a trip to the cinema in east Belfast with deputy First Minister Michelle O#Neill.The pair were snapped with large boxes of popcorn as they joined pensioners at the Strand Arts Centre, as coronavirus restrictions lted, for a showing of classic short films.During the visit Mrs Foster questioned the existence of a letter of no-confidence against her signed by DUP MLAs and MPs that led to her downfall. It#s now been nearly four weeks since I heard about it and I still haven#t seen it, she said.In the Assembly, Justice Minister Naomi Long told MLAs she saw no substantive reason for a judge-led review into the Bobby Storey funeral. Ms O#Neill said it was time to get on with rebuilding our economy rather than continuing to focus on the funeral of the former IRA member.New UUP leader Doug Beattie said issues around the funeral could affect the future of Stormont itselfnot addressed, warning of terminal decline”.A busy week for Edwin Poots began with him answering a question from Jim Allister about compensation for slaughtered animals. Mr Poots, in his written answer, revealed that in   his department paid £,, in compensation for animals slaughtered for disease control purposes. Of this, £,, related to bovine Tuberculosis £, related to avian influenza and £, for Caprine Arthritis Encephalitis.Tuesday: The Assembly debated Finance Minister Conor Murphy#s budget with MLAs highly critical.Finance Committee chair Steve Aiken said it was hard to scrutinise the budget given its limited granularity, occasional evasions and obfuscations from departments.SDLP MLA Matthew O#Toole criticised NHS waiting lists, saying we should be ashamed and the budget contained no plans to address his concerns.The DUP#s Paul Frew responded, saying it was refreshing to hear Luke Skywalker in the corner, although he did sound more like Chewbacca at times, he looks to a truth that we all need the wisdom of Yoda in times of stress like this”.Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon was also critical of new DUP leader#s Edwin Poots# refusal to attend meetings of north-south bodies saying it was hugely frustrating the meetings had been deliberately obstructed.TUV leader Jim Allister said he hoped Mr Poots would refuse to engage until the Northern Ireland Protocol was dismantled, saying it had trashed east-west relations. Later the new DUP leader said he remained committed to all his obligations, but north-south relations had never been worse.Arlene Foster continued to throw herself into events to forget her troubles during her final days as First Minister.During a visit to Brooklands Primary School in Dundonald she said: “Regardless of what’s happening where, a visit to a school never fails to lt my spirits. Meeting young people is always a humbling, but invigorating experience.Wednesday: Unionists were sacriced for the Northern Ireland Protocol, Westminster#s NI Affairs Committee heard.PUP Belfast councillor Dr John Kyle said nationalists and unionists had not been treated equally during the Brexit process.The identity and ethos of the unionist community, as equal citizens with everyone  in the United Kingdom, was sacriced, he said.Dr Kyle did accept the protocol may have some economic benefits, but added for many unionists being British is more important than being prosperous.In the Assembly the Education Committee heard evidence from the General Teaching Council for Northern Ireland .Chair Brendan Morgan revealed that in nine months’ time organisations in Northern Ireland would no longer have access to the EU safeguarding database which is used to for background checks on applicants as a result of Brexit.“Is Brexit is actually exposing our children to potential risk , Sinn Fein#s Pat Sheehan asked.“As of September , we will no longer have access to that database which screens professional teachers,” Mr Morgan explained.Thursday: What was supposed to be a formal ratication process for his leadership of the DUP turned into a nightmare for Edwin Poots.As new UUP leader Doug Beattie contentedly sipped a whiskey after being unanimously elected to lead his party, a DUP rubber stamping exercise laid the party#s isions bare for the world to see.While an attempt to hold a secret ballot to confirm Mr Poots# leadership was rejected, senior party figures including Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, Gavin Robinson, Gregory Campbell and Diane Dodds walked out while he was making his acceptance speech.Outgoing leader Arlene Foster also left early, and as a waiting media asked her for information on what was happening inside, a cheerful Mrs Foster quipped you#ll soon find out and flashed a peace sign.Paul Bell, a member of the Fermanagh and South Tyrone DUP for over  years, emotionally quit and said the party would haemorrhage votes as a result of Mrs Foster#s treatment.The issue of nurses’ pay was back of the agenda. Alex Easton asked Health Minister Robin Swann, in an Assembly question, about plans for a pay rise in the coming year.Mr Swann responded: “The pay round for   for NHS and HSC staff has not yet been finalised. Any decision on a pay award for nurses and other NI health workers, will be taken after the pay review bodies make their recommendations..Mr Swann said he was “committed to a fair pay settlement for all our healthcare staff going forward”Friday: The fallout from the DUP#s leadership fiasco continued into Friday. After reports that Sir Jeffrey Donaldson told Thursday#s meeting that his campaign team had been subjected to threats and intimidation from the UDA, there were calls for a police investigation.Sinn Fein#s North Belfast MP John Finucane called the claims deeply disturbing.If true, this is a very worrying development that an armed, illegal organisation was involved in influencing the outcome of the leadership contest of the largest party in unionism and a party of government, he said.It represents an attempt to subvert the democratic process and that is totally unacceptable.Arlene Foster announced she would stand down from the role on Tuesdayher replacement Edwin Poots proceeds with an Executive reshuffle.She also had some advice for her successor: There are very many good people who vote for us, who support us but he needs to recognise there is a lot of work to do in terms of healing isions that are quite obviously there in the party..app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Most ReadDeath of Paul McKeown , discharged with ruptured appendix from Antrim Hospital, was ‘preventable’, inquest toldPortstewart fire on Bank Holiday Monday damages business premisesWatch: Police vehicle involved in serious collision in east BelfastBBC presenter Andrew Marr slammed for ‘poor research’ on NI ProtocolEdwin Poots braced for a raft of resignations as DUP implodesTop Videos\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news eda .ece AUTOCROP wh bedcfbdaceccff.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news eda .ece AUTOCROP wh bedcfbdaceccff.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayPolice car involved in east Belfast crashPlayArlene Foster says election intimidation from UDA #quite shocking#Play graves damaged in Newtownabbey cemetery Latest PoliticsDUP’s Poots makes party changes but defers Executive reshuffleBrexit: EU ambassador accuses DUP’s Poots of lacking ‘adherence to reality’ over NI ProtocolDUP leader Edwin Poots expected to reveal new ministerial team with ‘surprise’ a possibility as need for olive branch to Donaldson campUUP leader Doug Beattie warns DUP and Sinn Fein against collapsing StormontUlster Unionists more appealing than DUP, claims young loyalist who warned of possible violence over NI Protocol LatestMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Confirmed Covid cases in your area and seven day rolling averageWhy Liverpool#s latest links with a move for Philippe Coutinho have one big missing ingredientSteve Clarke confident of no further Covid scares despite John Fleck positivePrime Minister took short break after wedding, No  confirmsGermany probes fraud allegations after surge in testing centres,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

In March, Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon announced a raft of new measures in a bidto improve facilities for pedestrians and increase public space in the city centre. The measures included the introduction of a one-way system from Carlisle Road, through Ferryquay Gate into The Diamond. It was stated in March that the new traffic system would be operational from April. However, it has still not begun. When contacted by the Derry News about the delay, a spokesperson for the Department for Infrastructuresaid it was anticipated that the scheme would now commence in early June. googletag.cmd.push “The Department and Derry City and Strabane District Council continue to work collaboratively to implement measures to help better share street space in the city centre in preparation for the relaxation of the Covid restrictions and an increase in pedestrian numbers. “It is planned to introduce a one way system in Ferryquay Street as a temporary intervention and introduce a priority system at Shipquay Gate to provide safer pedestrian access at this busy location. “The work is anticipated to commence in early June.” A spokesperson for the local council also confirmed that the traffic measure are expected to commence in early June and added that the council is working closely with the Department and contractors in bringing this forward. googletag.cmd.push “Further information in relation to the planned works and impact on traffic in the city centre will be communicated to the public in advance,” the council spokesperson added. It is planned that the one-way system at Ferryquay Street will be in place for  months. A review on its impact will then be made. As well as the Ferryquay Street plans, the new measures put forward also include the removal of the existing parking area at the quadrant outside the former Austin’s department store in the Diamond. A priority system for traffic is also to be introduced at Shipquay Gate which will allow a new footway to be created under this historic gate.     New spaces are also to be created on Bishop Street to facilitate outdoor trading opportunities for cafeacute-type businesses. The scheme has been agreed in partnership with the council as part of the Covid recovery process. Speaking in March when she announced the planned measures for Derrys city centre, Mrs Mallonsaid: “The Covid pandemic has brought many changes to how we conduct our daily lives and as we move towards a recovery phase I want to play my part in the transformation that our society deserves. This means creating a greener, cleaner more sustainable environment with less reliance on motor vehicles and a renewed focus on those who wish to walk, wheel and cycle. Once completed these measures will transform the Derry cityscape, providing safe spaces for all who work and live there to meet, shop and travel. “I am also committed to working with other local councils, stakeholders and local people so that we can shape our future together and deliver similar changes across our villages, towns and cities.”  --XX DO NOT USEXX If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The scheme is part of theColmcille year-long commemoration marking the thanniversary of the birth ofColmcille - also known as StColumba. Around eighteen projects have received funding throughout the council area. The latest, is situated in St Columb’s Wells, which was named after the founder of Derry. Wooden sculptures are fixed to the gable walls of several houses in the area. One of the houses , which faces on to Meenan Square, had experienced issues with graffiti over the years.  The Colmcille Wood Sculpture Project was conceived by Liam Kennedy and Judi Logue in Eden Place Arts Centre in Pilots Row. googletag.cmd.push Each sculpture is crafted from sweet chestnut they were carved in  by the nine men and women whose signatures sit at the bottom. Artists worked with Rosaleen O’Callaghan to identy nine areas of Colmcille’s le that that they all agreed should be highlighted, and were assisted in their designs by Maire Mullan. The sculptures were originally displayed at Pilots Row. HISTORY  Columba is derived from the Latin word for Dove. Colmcille is Irish and means Dove of the Church. Columba was born around December ,  at Gartan in County Donegal. He died on June , , on the island of Iona, where he had founded his most famous monastery. googletag.cmd.push St Columb’s Wells has been associated with Colmcille since the sixth century and the holy well situated in the area is the last remaining of three dating back to medieval Derry. The wells were named after St Colmcille, St Adhamhnan – a successor to Colmcille as Abbot of Iona and his biographer – and St Martin of Tours. Every June , St Columb’s Wells is blessed and St Colmcille is asked to protect his followers, ‘who walk where he walked and pray where he prayed’. The name of Derry’s patron saint is found throughout the city in street names and historic buildings, sometimes in the Latin form of Columba, Anglicised as Columb, or in the original Gaelic – Colmcille.     He has been especially venerated at St Columb’s Well and St Columba’s Church, Long Tower. Since  there have been houses located at St Columb’s Wells and from the s onwards a distinct, and proud, community grew up in the shadow of Derry’s Walls. Over time ‘The Wells’, as the area became known, came to include St. Columb’s Wells , St. Columb’s Terraceand St Columb’s Street . The area was redeveloped in the late s and early s and the modern St Columb’s Wells was built in . The project was realised with support from the Northern Ireland Housing Executive , Eden Place Arts Centre, City of Culture , Aras Cholmcille and Triax Neighbourhood Management Team.

The scheme is part of theColmcille year-long commemoration marking the thanniversary of the birth ofColmcille - also known as StColumba. Around eighteen projects have received funding throughout the council area. The latest, is situated in St Columb’s Wells, which was named after the founder of Derry. Wooden sculptures are fixed to the gable walls of several houses in the area. One of the houses , which faces on to Meenan Square, had experienced issues with graffiti over the years.  The Colmcille Wood Sculpture Project was conceived by Liam Kennedy and Judi Logue in Eden Place Arts Centre in Pilots Row. googletag.cmd.push Each sculpture is crafted from sweet chestnut they were carved in  by the nine men and women whose signatures sit at the bottom. Artists worked with Rosaleen O’Callaghan to identy nine areas of Colmcille’s le that that they all agreed should be highlighted, and were assisted in their designs by Maire Mullan. The sculptures were originally displayed at Pilots Row. HISTORY  Columba is derived from the Latin word for Dove. Colmcille is Irish and means Dove of the Church. Columba was born around December ,  at Gartan in County Donegal. He died on June , , on the island of Iona, where he had founded his most famous monastery. googletag.cmd.push St Columb’s Wells has been associated with Colmcille since the sixth century and the holy well situated in the area is the last remaining of three dating back to medieval Derry. The wells were named after St Colmcille, St Adhamhnan – a successor to Colmcille as Abbot of Iona and his biographer – and St Martin of Tours. Every June , St Columb’s Wells is blessed and St Colmcille is asked to protect his followers, ‘who walk where he walked and pray where he prayed’. The name of Derry’s patron saint is found throughout the city in street names and historic buildings, sometimes in the Latin form of Columba, Anglicised as Columb, or in the original Gaelic – Colmcille.     He has been especially venerated at St Columb’s Well and St Columba’s Church, Long Tower. Since  there have been houses located at St Columb’s Wells and from the s onwards a distinct, and proud, community grew up in the shadow of Derry’s Walls. Over time ‘The Wells’, as the area became known, came to include St. Columb’s Wells , St. Columb’s Terraceand St Columb’s Street . The area was redeveloped in the late s and early s and the modern St Columb’s Wells was built in . The project was realised with support from the Northern Ireland Housing Executive , Eden Place Arts Centre, City of Culture , Aras Cholmcille and Triax Neighbourhood Management Team.

He waves a cursory greeting and continues on his way. In the time it takes me to gather everything I need together, he passes me again, his step count no doubt rising with every lap of the town. Zoom. Walk. Laptop. Bake. Netflix. Repetition has become endemic over the last year, but its something Moneymore cant be accused of. There is a unique feel to the fronts of the buildings that greet me as I walk around the town. Even the post office, now boarded up, remains unbranded. googletag.cmd.push Moneymores terrain gives the town a layered effect. The pillared entrance of The Manor House provides the backdrop to the towns mini roundabout, welcoming motorists coming down the hill from Smith Street. Rusty scaffolding frames a construction site on my left as I make my way down. A woman waters potted plants in her compact front garden. The distinctive smell of curry is emanating from the two Chinese restaurants at the bottom of the hill. Shutters are down on Antonios pizza, yet to open for the day. More scaffolding sits alongside buildings in mid-construction off High Street, but no work appears to be going on today. googletag.cmd.push Along Lawford Street there are ersion signs in place as Council staff busy themselves in resurfacing the Turnaface Road. The grating sound of the road roller echoes off the houses that line the street leading back to the town centre. You could describe Moneymore as ornate. Older, unique buildings, set at dferent levels, create a layered backdrop, crowned by the spire of St John and St Treas church on the top of the hill.  The hum of a small aircraft passing overhead and the unmistakable smell of freshly-cut grass adds to the sense of a town taking new-found pleasure in the mundane.     A pregnant sky threatens rain. Taken a dip I nip into The Mane Barber Shop, where a neon sign declares the shop open for business. Owner Pauline McGarvey is at her lunch. She says reopening has not been the silver bullet the industry was hoping for. “This week has been terrible. For the first seven days [after reopening] it was great, but its taken a dip again,” she tells me. “The older folk that keep you going – your pensioners and farmers and that during the day – they havent been about the same. A vintage tractor model welcomes visitors to the town from the Tyrone side. “It was a gamble coming into a small town. You do have a bit of passing trade but youre hoping people are going to come in from the likes of Coagh, Lissan and Loup. “I said I would give it six months and see how it turns. Its fine, but its not busy. You have that fear of whether its going to come back.” Pauline has been in Moneymore three years, and until the pandemic ruthlessly attacked all businesses, things had been going well.  has seen a seismic change across all industries, driving many hair and beauty professionals off the high street altogether. “Lots of people are working from home and I have to admit, Im tempted,” she says. “Youre still going to be hit with rates, and you havent stopped paying your water bill, your electricity, your rent. “Yes, we got a bit of help, butyouve no customers in, then that money is all going to go and you still have to find wages too. “Ive seen a lot of hair and beauty people who havent gone back from the first lockdown.” Humanity adapts though, and over the last year, Pauline has embraced the situation in which the world found itself. She got married in February, and has enjoyed the extra time with her family. Keeping an eye on litter in the area. “It was the first time in my le I could actually say I was a mummy. I loved spending time with the weans,” she says. “It felt like wed a whole  years wrapped into one year. It is nice getting back though, you need the routine. Its bittersweet in a way.” Cookstown native Pauline says lockdown has really hit young people in the area hard. Her daughter, Danielle, is in Year , her entire GCSE years undertaken amid a worldwide health crisis. “Even she says she could do with another year at school,” she says. “Theyve missed a full year of preparation for the next step. Theyve been living alone in their bedroom. No formal, nothing. They werent even in school to plan it.” Its a quiet day in the barber shop, on what would normally be a busy Friday afternoon, with people popping in ahead of their weekend plans. There would have been excited chatter, the buzz of anticipation. Last minute changes of plan. Maybe even a wee drink. A look at her schedule confirms a gap of a few hours until Paulines next appointment. Without that steady flow of customers, the day can be long, lonely even. Welcome to Moneymore. Company is a two way street, and the dynamic of conversation, service and industry has been greatly missed by both barber and customer. “Even the most bald man that I have is in here every week,” says Pauline. “Two seconds would do it, but you would stretch it out to ten or  minutes, just because he likes coming in for the company. “Sometimes its just nice to get sitting down and get it done for you. Even though I have good faithful customers, I was nervous and jittery the first day back. “The amount of people who are saying its great to see you back, it gives you that wee glow. It would be nice to see a boom in Moneymore again. “I dont think anybody is going to feel anything dferent. Were all just going with the flow and trying not to stress and worry. “I think youre just going to have to wipe this year out the same as last year.”  The indicators that marked the early, panic-stricken days of the pandemic – the empty streets, closed schools, empty supermarket shelves – have long faded into memory. Only the window dressing remains. Sanitisers at shop doors. Face masks in shops. The odd discarded rubber glove on the street. All three car dealerships on the Magherafelt Road are dotted with customers as I drive past on the way home. The petrol station forecourt is hiving with people. By next Monday, theof indoor hospitality will mark another signicant step on the road to recovery. On the way out of the town, I spot a familiar cowboy hat bobbing up and down at the road side. A man enjoying his rediscovered freedom on the fringes of the Sperrins.  --XX DO NOT USEXX If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

After crossing the bridge, I head up the hill and pull the car in opposite the Vivo and the magnicently named Rio Grande bar. Parks Rio Grande, the Faughan River, flows through the centre of the village, which this afternoon sits under an angry-looking sky. A woman walks her dog down Learmount Road, her face set against the stf breeze that is swishing through the trees surrounding the village. The scene on Learmount Road leading up the hill. Rain starts to fall as a mother guides her toddler out the doors of the Vivo, one hand clutching hers and the other gripping the bottle of juice he has just been bought. googletag.cmd.push A large plastic ice cream cone sits hopefully outside the shop. Up the hill comes a learner driver seemingly on a lesson. She stops outside Learmount Resource Centre and disappears into the building, before emerging with her child in tow to resume her lesson. A delivery driver pulls into the yard of Devine Kitchens. He s to his cab and pulls out a hammer. Things must be getting serious. As I cross the bridge, I spot the wheel from an old watermill by the river side, almost reclaimed by its surroundings. A remnant of an  flax mill known as Quigleys Mill. googletag.cmd.push Perhaps the most clear view of the mill is from the top of the hill outside Park Hardware and DIY. Greg McElhinney and Matthew Devine. Inside, owner Greg McElhinney says the last year has been busy. “With construction and everything  closing down last April, we were very busy, which was good for us because people from the local area were able to do home projects,” he tells me. “The weather was good as well, so youd a lot of painting and decorating – fences and gardens and stuff like that – going on. “People were happy there was a local business still operating, because a lot of the bigger hardware stores had closed.     “It got to the stage when it was hard to source materials because suppliers were closed until June time, but people were happy enough to occupy their time. They had nothing  to do.” The remains of Quigleys Mill, Park. Parks postal area recorded an increase in Covid cases last week, and despite the attachment to Derry city skewing the numbers, Greg admits there is still a degree of worry locally. “The majority of the population feel we still have to be serious about this. Its drilled into everybody at this stage, like putting your seatbelt on in the car,” he says. “The worry now is were straddling the Donegal border to a certain extent and case numbers are very high either side of it. “There is more positivity now than there was maybe six weeks ago though. Society is opening up again, and the vaccinations are a positive thing.” Covid has taken its toll on rural le too, and compliance with regulations has come at a social cost for village communities. “Where were based is very much a rural area, with a lot of the farming community and tradesmen and stuff,” says Greg. “You get some people who, by chance, meet up outside the shop here and have an opportunity to have a chat that maybe havent seen each other in a few months. “Those guys would have been at markets or farm meets every week, or pubs, but now you see them sitting out there for half an hour chatting to each other. “The social aspect, face to face, is the biggest thing. “The local community group have done a lot of work with the walkways there over the past number of years, which is very good.” Caroline Lynch and Catriona Doughty from Learmount Community Development Group. The local community group to which Greg refers is Learmount Community Development Group, which is nestled down a lane next to the entrance to Learmount Forest. Over the last year, Caroline Lynch and Catriona Doughty have noticed a big increase in people using Parks hidden gem. “We would have come down here some mornings and that car park would be full,” says Caroline. “Our secret Learmount Forest isnt a secret any more, and thats great, because everybody wants out, and weve had drop-ins coming from that.” “The forest has been fantastic for people being able to get out and safely meet their neighbours,” adds Catriona. “Theyll maybe call in at quiet times to have a socially distanced cup of tea. That social aspect has been missed, they are missing company and casual conversation.” Caroline feels the experience of the last year has sharpened focus on the issue of loneliness that had been hiding in plain sight. “We had a man who lives alone and had been sick for two or three days,” she says. “He hadnt been out and had no food in the house, so thankfully we were able to help with that. “You just know people are lonely and looking to get out again, but at the same time are a bit anxious about it. “Theyre happy to take the summer out of it and see what happens. There is certainly a lot of loneliness, isolation and depression though. “You could obviously be in the middle of a housing site and still be lonely, but when you see some of the people on their own, up a lane, they see nobody. They barely even see the postman now.” Working with both young and old people, the group have seen the effect the pandemic and its associated lockdowns have had on both generations.  “A lot of our work is with older people, and whilst theyre saying theyre fed up, some of them are getting a wee bit set in their ways,” says Caroline. “You just know by talking to them. We had a woman who always came in every week, even when it was bad, and she hasnt been in about two months. “Its highlighted how much we miss the social side of things, not being able to get out and meet friends. Even for the youth. “People always think all they need is their phone, because thats all theyre sitting on, but you can see now how the youth are crying out as much for social contact as any other generation.” There is hope though, that with the vaccines roll out and the upcoming warmer weather, that the group will be able to run some of their usual summer events. “We are looking at putting together a summer programme, but wed be a bit nervous ourselves about bringing a group of people into the room,” says Caroline.  “It would be perfectthere was good weather, because it will be planned outdoors. If the weather is bad, well take it over to Park hall, because its a bit bigger than here. “We have funding for dancing and music, which I think people would love to hear. Wed love to have tables out there on a nice evening, with a bit of a barbecue and a bit of music. “Youd like to think by September, we should be able to get going.” On the way back through the village, the shutters are half up on the Rio Grande as preparations continue inside. By the time you read this it will have reopened its doors. Hospitality has ed throughout the county, another step on the road to recovery. The farmers outside Greg McElhinneys store now have somewhere  to shoot the breeze. For the next few weeks at least, Covid fears will be drowned out by clink of glasses, the audible relief of the repressed socialite and the laughter of friends reunited. Dancing, however, is still prohibited under the regulations. It may need to be done across Parks Rio Grande, rather than inside it.  --XX DO NOT USEXX If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It wasnt enough to please skipper Chrissy McKaigue who looked on his sides performance as a mixed bag. In a game they couldve as easily lost, Derry surrendered a five-point lead in the first-half and after holding Cavan scoreless for  minutes, the Oakleafers were almost reeled in from being seven points clear in the second-half. “I thought our good play was really good today but our poor play was really poor.” commented McKaigue, but his body language suggested he was far from happy. googletag.cmd.push “That’s something we’re working on, to try and become more consistent. We’re not going to really challenge the top teams in Ulsterwe’re not more consistent than that, to be honest.” In the first-half, Cavan goalkeeper Raymond Galligan denied Shane McGuigan and then Gareth McKinless goals McKaigue felt wouldve changed the shape of the game. Across the three games, McKaigue feels Derry havent been clinical enough, something they are fully aware of. “We need to get better because, as you can see at this level, a missed goal opportunity, a couple of missed chances, it can give the other team oxygen, give them energy and Cavan fed off our own mistakes today,” he said. googletag.cmd.push “As dogged and as spirited as they were, we contributed a lot to our own downfall today, there’s no question about that.” Two years ago, Derrys away win in Limerick dug Damian McErlains side out of Division  and its the same opponents standing in the way of ato Division  for the first time since the Oakleafers  relegation. “We’re still not guaranteed to go up....we’re not even guaranteed to get home advantage,” McKaigue added. “The reality iswe don’t beat Limerick our good work here is left redundant. We need to get prepared right because this is our first championship game of the year, there’s no hiding away from that.”     From their  encounter, McKaigue recalls Limerick as a big, strong, physical side, with massive men. “As they’ve shown in their last two league campaigns, they’re a match for most.” he added  --XX DO NOT USEXX If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It wasnt enough to please skipper Chrissy McKaigue who looked on his sides performance as a mixed bag. In a game they couldve as easily lost, Derry surrendered a five-point lead in the first-half and after holding Cavan scoreless for  minutes, the Oakleafers were almost reeled in from being seven points clear in the second-half. “I thought our good play was really good today but our poor play was really poor.” commented McKaigue, but his body language suggested he was far from happy. googletag.cmd.push “That’s something we’re working on, to try and become more consistent. We’re not going to really challenge the top teams in Ulsterwe’re not more consistent than that, to be honest.” In the first-half, Cavan goalkeeper Raymond Galligan denied Shane McGuigan and then Gareth McKinless goals McKaigue felt wouldve changed the shape of the game. Across the three games, McKaigue feels Derry havent been clinical enough, something they are fully aware of. “We need to get better because, as you can see at this level, a missed goal opportunity, a couple of missed chances, it can give the other team oxygen, give them energy and Cavan fed off our own mistakes today,” he said. googletag.cmd.push “As dogged and as spirited as they were, we contributed a lot to our own downfall today, there’s no question about that.” Two years ago, Derrys away win in Limerick dug Damian McErlains side out of Division  and its the same opponents standing in the way of ato Division  for the first time since the Oakleafers  relegation. “We’re still not guaranteed to go up....we’re not even guaranteed to get home advantage,” McKaigue added. “The reality iswe don’t beat Limerick our good work here is left redundant. We need to get prepared right because this is our first championship game of the year, there’s no hiding away from that.”     From their  encounter, McKaigue recalls Limerick as a big, strong, physical side, with massive men. “As they’ve shown in their last two league campaigns, they’re a match for most.” he added  --XX DO NOT USEXX If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Cavan are a big team. That went with a big squeeze at times. Yes, its learning.

It wasnt easy on Postieor anybody , he is a phenomenal talent.” All during the first-half, Cavan – both in terms of a press and their sideline collectively shouting on every Derry kick-out – set their stall out to stle Derry. “That was going to happen after getting things all our own way . Cavan are a big team. That went with a big squeeze at times. Yes, its learning. We rectied it well at half-time andyou would hope the next day it happens you could recty it on the field.” When askedwinning the game on limited possession was a signicant boost to their confidence, the Derry boss felt the step up in class was the most pleasing factor. “It’s a game against a serious team. With all due respect to the lower isions youre not playing teams of that calibre enough. We want to play teams like Cavan and teams like them more.  --XX DO NOT USEXX If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The councils Corporate Policy and Resources Committee last week altered their standing orders to allow for remote meetings after the Stormont governments legislation expired earlier this month. Councillor Darryl Wilson suggested reviewing the changes in September with a view to councillors ing to the chamber, but said remote access could still be granted for council staff. “The pandemic is still here, and we will do what we can to keep staff and elected representatives safe,” he said. “I personally find the governance and democratic works best when all elected members are present here. googletag.cmd.push “I understand why they cant be at the minute, butthe opportunity arises in the future, I think they should be in here. “I dont think this applies to staff. Weve sat here where members of staff have sat awaiting their item coming up for two, three hours. “Those staff are maybe having to get childcare and its not good time management for them, or for the finances of the council with fuel and other associated costs.” The suggestion sparked a passionate response from Benbradagh councillor Kathleen McGurk, who said the council should take the opportunity to make local politics more inclusive. googletag.cmd.push “I think we are missing a major opportunity to embrace this moving forward,” she told the committee. “There seems to be resistance from some members, who continually look to move back to the old way we were working, with members back in the chamber. “We have been looking at ways of becoming a more inclusive organisation and bringing dferent people into politics why would we not extend the benefits of remote or hybrid meetings to members  “I am a young, working mother and its dficult to attend the chamber all the time. Remote meetings have meant I have been able to juggle home, working and political le much more easily.     “A review is fine, but why is the default position always how can we get everybody back into the chamber  “It really frustrates me to see the opposition to this opportunity to overhaul how we work and make politics a more inclusive environment for everybody.”  Alderman William Duddy said the optics of councillors being in the chamber was important. “We need to get back to an air of normality. Were elected to the chamber, were not elected to our kitchen tables,” he said. “Part of whats missing are the discussions in between, before and after the meetings that can help improve business within this council.” SDLP councillor Orla Beattie said members had forgotten about previous occasions when remote access to meetings may have been useful. “In the past weve had meetings cancelled because of weather,” she said. “Thats something we have to take into consideration sometimes its just safer to be working from home. Its an option we have to keep open.” Cllr James McCorkell concluded the discussion by saying the council should show leadership on getting things back to normality. “Anyone with health conditions, come September or October, will most certainly have had their second vaccine,” he said. “At this stage, we need to be looking at our mental health and getting out amongst people. There is a social aspect to this as well and I think we should show leadership on it.” The committee then voted to approve the motion to provide for remote or hybrid meetings, with a review to be held in September.  --XX DO NOT USEXX If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

A motion from Sinn Feacutein councillor John McNamee said the council had a duty to consult with rate payers on the issue of Irish reunication and suggested the council form a working group. The suggestions drew the ire of unionist councillors in the chamber, and a y debate on the pros and cons of a united Ireland followed. Magherafelt DUP councillor Paul McLean criticised the approach taken by the council themselves and said it did not augur well for unionists in a united Ireland. googletag.cmd.push “If what we have seen within Mid Ulster Council, is what we would face within a united Ireland, then as unionists, we dont have a lot to look forward to,” he said. “We have seen this council, that is Sinn Feacutein orientated and led, absolutely annihilate, at every time, everything we have put forward. “You have undermined our culture, our creed, our class and everything . To be honest, the message Sinn Feacutein are giving tonight is Brits Out. “Im a British subject, and Im proud to be in the Union. “I dont even believe this motion is legal and I would ask the Chief Executive to get a legal opinion to seehis officers can implement it,” said Cllr McLean. googletag.cmd.push Chair Cathal Mallaghan said all motions brought to council had to be checked by council officials. “Every motion submitted to council is checked by Democratic Services to seeit meets the standing orders, and on this occasion, it did,” he said. Carntogher Sinn Feacutein councillor Coacutera Corry said everything should be on the table in discussions, and supported the establishment of the working group. “Thats all on the table. Thats what we want to have in the workshops everybody involved laying out what they envisage,” she said. “We would have full access to the EU, as they have said we could go straight back in there. There is a lot of discussion on a Bill of Rights.     “I want healthcare reform. There is a two-tier healthcare system creeping in in the North already.

Desertmartin Primary School will close its doors for a final time in August  after Education Minister Peter Weir approved plans for its closure in October . One parent, who has requested anonymity, said parents had sent two letters to the Department of Education , Education Authorityand the Derry Diocesan Board of Education , but had not received any reply. We have requested a meeting with the DDBOE and EA but to no avail. DE have been in limited contact with regards to this matter, they said. googletag.cmd.push There have been two letters sent by parents to all these parties raising questions and concerns regarding how proceedings have been handled and how very much out of the loop the parents have been. None of them have responded, which we feel is very unfair and just downright rude. Its not too much to ask for some answers, instead we get radio silence. We are very aware that the school cant be maintained as it stands at the minute and completely accept that it will be closing at the end of this term. We just cant fathom how the educational governing bodies and a religious organisation can be so evasive and feel that they are very under handed in their tactics. googletag.cmd.push We feel that their silence is in the hope thatthey dont respond to us by the end of June  then we will have to shut up and forget about it, that they wont have to answer our questions or concerns. The parent praised Desertmartin Primary School for the effect they have had on her children, one of whom has special educational needs. One of my children has special needs and will now be attending a new school. The progress my child has made since attending Desertmartin has been extraordinary, the staff have been unbelievable in how they have helped him.     He is reading and writing, something at one time I never thought hed be able to do, they have encouraged him, supported him and helped in so many ways that words could not describe how grateful I and my family are for them. It is just an absolute shame that in its final weeks of being open, the organisations involved at a higher level couldnt be a bit more open and honest with the families and people involved in the day to day of the school. It is a disgrace that these kinds of small rural schools wont be kept open due to financial reasons, when in so many cases the benefits of these smaller schools for so many children by far outweighs any amount of money. Last year, the Department of Education said all evidence had been taken into account regarding the decision to close the school. On  October , Education Minister Peter Weir approved the Development Proposalfor Desertmartin Primary School to discontinue with effectfrom  August at the latest, said a DE spokesperson.

Desertmartin Primary School will close its doors for a final time in August  after Education Minister Peter Weir approved plans for its closure in October . One parent, who has requested anonymity, said parents had sent two letters to the Department of Education , Education Authorityand the Derry Diocesan Board of Education , but had not received any reply. We have requested a meeting with the DDBOE and EA but to no avail. DE have been in limited contact with regards to this matter, they said. googletag.cmd.push There have been two letters sent by parents to all these parties raising questions and concerns regarding how proceedings have been handled and how very much out of the loop the parents have been. None of them have responded, which we feel is very unfair and just downright rude. Its not too much to ask for some answers, instead we get radio silence. We are very aware that the school cant be maintained as it stands at the minute and completely accept that it will be closing at the end of this term. We just cant fathom how the educational governing bodies and a religious organisation can be so evasive and feel that they are very under handed in their tactics. googletag.cmd.push We feel that their silence is in the hope thatthey dont respond to us by the end of June  then we will have to shut up and forget about it, that they wont have to answer our questions or concerns. The parent praised Desertmartin Primary School for the effect they have had on her children, one of whom has special educational needs. One of my children has special needs and will now be attending a new school. The progress my child has made since attending Desertmartin has been extraordinary, the staff have been unbelievable in how they have helped him.     He is reading and writing, something at one time I never thought hed be able to do, they have encouraged him, supported him and helped in so many ways that words could not describe how grateful I and my family are for them. It is just an absolute shame that in its final weeks of being open, the organisations involved at a higher level couldnt be a bit more open and honest with the families and people involved in the day to day of the school. It is a disgrace that these kinds of small rural schools wont be kept open due to financial reasons, when in so many cases the benefits of these smaller schools for so many children by far outweighs any amount of money. Last year, the Department of Education said all evidence had been taken into account regarding the decision to close the school. On  October , Education Minister Peter Weir approved the Development Proposalfor Desertmartin Primary School to discontinue with effectfrom  August at the latest, said a DE spokesperson. In reaching his decision the Minister gave careful consideration to the full range of evidence presented including all comments received during the statutory objection period and any pertinent statutory duties.

Pawel Stojanowski, of Piney Hill, Magherafelt, was charged in connection with two separate incidents on November ,  and December , . The court heard police had responded to reports of a vehicle driving erratically and colliding with the central reservation on the road between Randalstown and Toome. Police located Stojanowskis vehicle two hours later on Aughrim Road, with the defendant sitting in the back seat, wearing an orange high-visibility vest and holding the car keys in his right hand. Officers detected the smell of alcohol, noted Stojanowskis eyes were glazed. A half-empty bottle of whiskey was also located in the passenger footwell of the car. googletag.cmd.push When questioned by police, the defendant said his we had been driving, and when police checks revealed this to be , he said maybe a friend had been driving the vehicle. After being subject to a road side breath test, Stojanowski said he had not been drinking while driving the car, that he had had a drink after stopping the car, and that he had been fishing. On December , police observed the defendants car swerving from the kerb to the hard shoulder and braking unnecessarily on the Moneymore Road, Magherafelt. After turning into Piney Hill, Magherafelt, police stopped the car and arrested Stojanowski again after smelling alcohol in the vehicle. He subsequently failed a breath test. googletag.cmd.push Defence for Stojanowski said he had been drinking at a friends house and did not think the alcohol would have an effect on his driving. Judge Mullan expressed concern that the defendant had been stopped for a similar offence within a month of the first incident occurring. She disqualied Stojanowski from driving for a period of two years, fined him pound for being in charge with excess alcohol in his breath and pound for driving with excess alcohol in his breath. A -month driving ban was also imposed for careless driving, alongside two offenders levies of pound each.      --XX DO NOT USEXX If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Pawel Stojanowski, of Piney Hill, Magherafelt, was charged in connection with two separate incidents on November ,  and December , . The court heard police had responded to reports of a vehicle driving erratically and colliding with the central reservation on the road between Randalstown and Toome. Police located Stojanowskis vehicle two hours later on Aughrim Road, with the defendant sitting in the back seat, wearing an orange high-visibility vest and holding the car keys in his right hand. Officers detected the smell of alcohol, noted Stojanowskis eyes were glazed. A half-empty bottle of whiskey was also located in the passenger footwell of the car. googletag.cmd.push When questioned by police, the defendant said his we had been driving, and when police checks revealed this to be , he said maybe a friend had been driving the vehicle. After being subject to a road side breath test, Stojanowski said he had not been drinking while driving the car, that he had had a drink after stopping the car, and that he had been fishing. On December , police observed the defendants car swerving from the kerb to the hard shoulder and braking unnecessarily on the Moneymore Road, Magherafelt. After turning into Piney Hill, Magherafelt, police stopped the car and arrested Stojanowski again after smelling alcohol in the vehicle. He subsequently failed a breath test. googletag.cmd.push Defence for Stojanowski said he had been drinking at a friends house and did not think the alcohol would have an effect on his driving. Judge Mullan expressed concern that the defendant had been stopped for a similar offence within a month of the first incident occurring. She disqualied Stojanowski from driving for a period of two years, fined him pound for being in charge with excess alcohol in his breath and pound for driving with excess alcohol in his breath. A -month driving ban was also imposed for careless driving, alongside two offenders levies of pound each.      --XX DO NOT USEXX If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

His -year playing career ended on the Evergreens in the early s.Joersquos role as match secretary for twenty years was absolutely crucial given his unique ability to dig out players when all seemed lost, recruiting players at Down High on Saturday mornings to fulfil fixtures later that day.Complete strangers would often turn up for second  matches in the early days saying that Joe had instructed them to turn up and play.Despite his tireless work on behalf of the club, Joersquos greatest pleasure throughout his rugby le has been the friends he has made along the way.A keen tourist, he has travelled the world to follow rugby and even took in some of the Lions fixtures in South Africa in .He was tour manager on the legendary  Ballynahinch tour of Canada, as well as partaking in a few trips away with the Evergreens.When promotion to the All-Ireland League was secured in , Joe was a regular spectator at games all over the country and could be seen at every first XV home fixture in his familiar spot on the m line until very recently.The flat cap, long navy Adidas coat, familiar cough and half pint of Harp should conjure up an image of Joe to everyone who knows him, and to countless others who have passed through the Ballynahinch club in recent years not knowing the huge influence he has had on their rugby.Joe is the recipient of the coveted Spence Cup this season. He is truly deserving of this award and it is le-affirming to see that friendships gained through team sports run deep as Sam Robinson, himself a Spence Cup winner, acts as carer for Joe as his health deteriorates.Rugby it seems, is giving something back to one of itrsquos finest local servants.On behalf of the Spence family, Emma Rice commened: ldquoThe Spence Cup is given to a member who shows an example of commitment to the rugby club. Joe Carlislersquos service to the club in time and deed epitomises this.ldquoA society grows great when old men plant trees whose shade they know they will never sit in. We are often guilty of not noticing a tree that gives the shade we sit under, she continued.ldquoPlayers of today may no longer see as much of that familiar face on the m line at Ballymacarn Park, but they will see the roots, the structure, the shade and benefit from what wee Joe once planted. Thank you and congratulations, Joe..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26May2021-Business.jpg","title":"Business owners join forces in their love of baking  ","story":"THEY became virtual supporters of each otherrsquos business during lockdown mdash now two women bakers are working together to raise money for dementia research.Ciara Van Vogt, the owner of Margaretrsquos Cottage BB in Ardglass and Sharon Campbell from Mrs Crsquos Home Kitchen in Dundrum, have raised pound, so far for the Alzheimerrsquos Society from an online bake sale.They supported each otherrsquos business efforts through lockdown last year by connecting on social media but did not meet in person until March.When they did, the two ladies struck up an immediate friendship and decided to put their skills together and collaborate on a project.Sharon said: ldquoDuring lockdown charities have really suffered and there are many worthy causes out there, we both agreed it was hard to support just one.ldquoBoth businesses support their own inidual local charities and will continue to do, but we chose to support an Alzheimerrsquos charity because we both know many people affected by this awful disease.Ciara is a carer for her elderly mother, Mrs Eithne Fitzsimons, who was diagnosed with Alzheimerrsquos disease four years ago.ldquoI lose a bit of Mum every week, and sometimes Mum doesnrsquot know who I am, said Ciara.ldquoLockdown has stopped support groups and activities for people with dementia. Itrsquos been very challenging for carers and their loved ones, and people often forget that carersrsquo lives are adversely affected too.ldquoImagine having a spouse or parent who no longer recognises you and who due to this awful disease you no longer recognise.One of the things that resonates with both women is the thought of any loved one losing all our precious memories.Ciara continued: ldquoResearch into the causes of, and treatment for dementia is critically important but not a priority for UK governments.ldquoWe would love to see this dreadful disease eradicated for future generations. We both have strong ties to Northern Ireland, being from here, although we both spent time living and working in England and Scotland before moving home to settle back in Co Down. Our mutual love of baking and cooking was how we met and became friends.The two bakers organised a virtual bake sale to raise money for dementia research.However they soon realised that due to geography not everyone could buy their fabulous baking, so they set up a JustGiving page to run alongside the bake sale.ldquoPlanning the challenges of a bake sale during lockdown was fun, so too was choosing some of our most popular products to sell to raise money, said Sharon.ldquoThe menu proved so popular. Within ten days we both realised we wouldnrsquot get much sleep as baking for Alzheimerrsquos became a top priority.Early mornings and late nights meant that customers received their sweet treats and funds are still being raised by the pair.If you want to check out their Just Giving page, details are: https:www.justgiving fundraising sharonandciarasbakesale and both ladies can be found on Facebook and Instagram..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26May2021-Campbell.jpg","title":"Campbell on form as Duns claim derby win  ","story":"DUNDRUM firsts defeated derby rivals Downpatrick by  runs on Friday evening to continue their push for a semi-final spot in the T Shield.Dundrum travelled to the Strangford Road after their pitch was deemed unplayable after heavy rain with the home side winning the toss and, on a cold damp evening, chose to field first.Dundrum opened with Greg Hutley and Stuart Campbell while Downpatrick opened the bowling with Justin Rea and Marty Gartland.Dundrum got off to a fast start adding  for the first wicket inside the first six overs before Hutley was dismissed for  off the bowling of Gartland.Dundrumrsquos run rate began to halt as a result of the combination of good Downpatrick bowling and a slow outfield.Terry Hutley and Campbell added  for the next wicket before Dundrum lost four quick wickets in the form of Campbell , Hutley , James Martinand Joel Maguire .This left Dundrum  for five with Downpatrick on top as Ian Wright and Gavin McNerlin added  for the next wicket before another clump of wickets fell to leave Dundrum  for nine after  overs.McNerlin managed to get Dundrum to  for nine from their  overs as he finished on  not out.The pick of the Downpatrick bowlers was James Ferguson who finished with figures of  for  from his four overs and the game was very much in the balance heading into the second innings.Downpatrick opened with brothers Michael and Daniel Carson whilst Dundrum elected to open the bowling with Davy Glover and Daniel Kearsley.Similar to Dundrumrsquos innings, Downpatrick got off to a fast start, putting on  for the first wicket inside the first six overs.The Downpatrick men combined well and began running fluently between the wickets to put the pressure on the Dundrum bowlers.Daniel Carsonwas dismissed off the bowling of Davy Glover after a good catch by Andrew Foster in the dee, with Paul Linehan next to the crease to join Michael Carson.Linehan looked to be aggressive, hitting a big six to keep the pressure on Dundrum as the two batsmen took the score to  for  inside nine overs.However, Dundrum began to fight back through Campbell and McNerlin. The former dismissed both Carson and Linehan in the same over to swing the match back in favour for Dundrum.This started a Downpatrick collapse with the last eight wickets falling for only  runs. McNerlin finished with figures of  for  from four overs while Campbell finished with  for  from his four overs, completing a -run win for Dundrum.It was a fantastic fight back for Dundrum and Downpatrick will know they let the game get away from them.Dundrum would like to thank Downpatrick Cricket Club for hosting the game with the match ball sponsored by Aiden McCabe from AMC building.Dundrum -Downpatrick  all outT SHIELD.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26May2021-Despair.jpg","title":"Despair for Down in second defeat  ","story":"DOWN were second best to a Meath side who ran out comfortable winners by a margin of seven points at Armaghrsquos Athletic Grounds on Sunday.Down were forfeiting their home advantage as a result of breaching the GAArsquos Covid- regulations during lockdown and perhaps that, coupled with the torrid weather conditions, attributed to their performance.Paddy Tally signicantly reshuffled his starting line-up following their opening day defeat against Mayo in Castlebar.The Down manager made a total of five changes, with goalkeeper Marc Reid and captain Darren OrsquoHagan the most notable of them all.Meath began the sharper of the two sides, but Down could not fault lady luck as their opponents were reduced to  men following a Eoin Harkey black card.The red and black outfit failed to take advantage of their additional man as Meath began scoring points through Cathal Hickey, Mathew Costello and Andrew Colgan.Corey Quinn did manage to score two points before the quarter for the Mourne county, but he also failed to convert a goal scoring chance which set the tone for the afternoon.The game was not away from Down at this stage as Quinn added to his tally alongside scores from Paul Devlin and Ryan McElroy to trail by only two points at half-time.It was a reverse in roles for the second half, as this time it was Down player Jonny Flynn who was shown the black card, leaving his side down a man.Unlike Down, Meath took full advantage of the extra shirt on the pitch and Cillian OrsquoSullivan buried two goals just before and after the third quarter to put the contest out of sight.Referee Niall Cullen was kept busy with his cards, this time displaying a red to Downrsquos Gerard McGovern to close out a miserable afternoon for Tallyrsquos men.Down now travel to Mullingar this Sunday, where they face off against Westmeath at Cusack Park.Down: M Reid P Fegan, G McGovern, P Murdock, P Laverty, D OrsquoHagan, C Mooney, R McEvoy , J Flynn, J Guinness, B OrsquoHagan , L Kerr, D Guinness, C Quinn , P Devlin .Subs: C Doherty for J Guinness , P Branagan for Mooney , S McConville for Kerr , G Collins for D OrsquoHagan , C Gough for Flynn , C McCrickardfor B OrsquoHagan , D Savage for Quinn Meath: A Colgan , S Lavin, C McGill, C Hickey , E Harkin, S McEntee, D Keogan, B Menton, P Harnan, E Devine , B McMahon , M Costello , J Morris , T OrsquoReilly , C OrsquoSullivan .Subs: R Ryan for Harkin , J Wallace for OrsquoReilly , E Wallacefor Hickey , J Scully for McMahon , J Conlon for Morris , D Campion for OrsquoSullivan , G McCoy for McEntee Referee: Niall Cullen Down -Meath -NFL DIVISION A.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26May2021-Dozens.jpg","title":"Dozens walk in memory of Seaforde Special Olympian  ","story":"UPWARDS of  people took part in a charity walk around Castlewellan Lake on Saturday in memory of Seaforde man Glenn McBride, who died  weeks ago.Glennwas a medalled Special Olympics competitor who enjoyed soccer and basketball, playing both to a high standard.He was a popular member of of Down Special Olympics Club in Downpatrick and Shimna Stars Special Olympics Club in Newcastle.Glenn won a soccer gold medal with Team Down at the Area Games in Belfast in  and was a member of the Ulster soccer team at the Ireland Games the following year.

But also to strengthen school community and pride in our fantastic school.Mr Austin paid tribute to the schools PTFA for its fundraising, to the board of governors for support and a group of volunteers who worked on the welcome garden.ldquoThe team spirit that has been displayed throughout this project has been uplting and a reflection of the strong school community that exists within St Colmcilles Primary School, he said.ldquoThe board of governors have supported this project throughout and are committed to a cycle of continuous improvement of all aspects of the school, especially its facilities and resourcesHe continued: ldquoThe PTFA have fundraised relentlessly through organising ious raffles, draws, bingos and hampers.

We wanted the money we raised to benefit every child in the school and therefore the school have all the children timetabled for outdoor learning everyday.ldquoThis makes our fundraising all worthwhile when you see happy children playing daily outdoors.The PTFA organised fundraising initiatives like bingo, raffles, hampers and draws which have allowed the school to further develop the footprint of the planned facilities for the children.The schoolrsquos Rainbow garden includes a tepee, a water wall for directing and controlling the flow of water, an activity table, a water and sand tray, outdoor shelter, sensory plants with a vivid colour or smell and plastic coated activity table where children can paint use sand and textiles to show their learning.Therersquos also an outdoor classroom which can hold up to  pupils and adults with bespoke seating and a blackboard with outdoor musical equipment.Itrsquos contained within ranch style fencing and is very popular with all the schoolrsquos pupils, particularly those within its learning support centres, many of whom have complex sensory needs.The new play park contains swings, slide, climbing tower, monkey bars, balance equipment, ropes, seesaws seating and planting areas.Children are timetabled at break and lunch times and for certain lessons throughout the day.An eye-catching circular stone planter has been filled with a iety of shrubs and trees in the new Welcome garden.Therersquos also a bespoke reading area overlooking four large rectangular sleeper planter boxes filled with beautul summer flowers, a solar powered water fountain, a bird bath and bird tables..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26May2021-Politicians.jpg","title":"Politicians gather to mark Northern Ireland centenary  ","story":"CROSSGAR marked Northern Irelandrsquos centenary on Monday with a special event.A number of local politicians including South Down MLA Harry Harvey and Rowallane councillors Billy Walker, Terry Andrews, Robert Burgess and Kathryn Owen met in the village square with each holding a torch which symbolised what happened in Crossgar a century ago when the province was formed.On that occasion, a bonfire was lit in the square by local residents to celebrate the creation of Northern Ireland on election night of the new parliament.The local MP was Sir James Craig, the first Prime Minister of Northern Ireland who had personal ties to Crossgar and had been its Westminster MP since .To mark the national and local event, local politicians from all parties were invited to hold a flame in a triangular shape on Monday symbolising the fire that was lit on the birth of the country in .Cllr Walker said he was delighted to have been invited to Crossgar to take part in the special event to mark Northern Irelandrsquos th birthday..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26May2021-Tributes.jpg","title":"Tributes paid to Down Rec soccer legend Jim Connolly  ","story":"JIM Connolly died on April  after a hard fought two year battle with illness.His passing was marked by a phenomenal level of tributes.Social media,work colleagues, team-mates and opponents alike expressed how well liked and respected he was in all walks of le.He was first and last a family man whether it was his brothers and sisters, Angie and his children or his beloved grandchildren.However Coot, as he was known, had another family which he held dear. He had been a vital cog in the Down Rec team which enjoyed great success in the late Seventies.But it was and remains the case that the Down Rec experience is defined by the enduring friendships which have stood the test of time.Coot grew up in Stream Street and the reason he knocked back opportunities to perform at levels his talent merited may well lie there.That part of Downpatrick had three working class housing developments, Ardpatrick and Russell Park with Stream Street and Ibrox Park in the middle.Ibrox was their playground, the place where Coot first kicked a football.He was a Stream Street kid and it seems he never wanted to be anything .When Jim Prior took him to Down Rec, it was a marriage made in heaven.In that dressing room you had another more senior Stream Street kid. Coot would have idolized Tony lsquoDartrsquo Curran in those days as he was the leader of the pack.Russell Park resident Barney Fitzsimmons was there too, a swashbuckling goalscorer who enjoyed something akin to Roy of the Rovers status at the time.Then you had the late great Paddy lsquoGeordyrsquo Galbraith, who combined a hard man reputation with a heart of gold.Peter Mulhall was another player he would have admired, a winner who proved the perfect centre back partner for the laid-back Coot.The total respect he had for them was accorded to all of us even though he was a better player than any of us. That was Coot Connolly.Prior realized that he needed to recruit from outside Downpatrick to fulfill his ambitions for the club and over a period of time he recruited players from Portaferry, Strangford, Ardglass, Dundrum, Crossgar, Saintfield, Killyleagh and Ballygowan.They were brought in for their ability but Jim couldnrsquot have known that the erse personalities therein would create the perfect storm in the dressing room.Neither could he have anticipated the level of support which flowed from those villages in the seasons to come.Dressing rooms are bastions of banter and slagging and with Dart jester-in chief, the group relished every minute they spent together.The five strong Portaferry contingent proved to be a vital ingredient, their earthy Ards humour and the opportunities their accents provided for slagging sealing their popularity.Jackie Leckey and Barney Ross brought another dimension willing as they were to join in the shenanigans on and off the pitch. Coot loved the craic and happily joined in the banter.However, he left the slagging to other less sensitive creatures of which there were plenty.A good example was the time I decided to get the footballers perm which was in vogue at the time. I should have known better.I got slaughtered, Dart declaring that I looked more like Shirley Temple than Kevin Keegan.Those were the days, as the saying goes, but happily there were plenty of good days ahead of us.We have had many reunions with Coot, an ever present and every one of them underlined the strength of the bond we enjoy so much.Sadly those reunions tend to be confined to wakes and funerals nowadays and the baby of our team has now joined Shane Breen, Paddy Galbraith and Marty Ross on the sidelines.Coot would have been the first to remind me that the Rec wasnrsquot only about the players.The one and only Charlie Oakes was highly influential in his role as assistant manager, while Austy Keating doubled as chairman and groundsman for many years.Joe Lyttle was our physio and his son Joea loyal player for years while my sister Tina was a committee member and a fanatical fan.They were all fully paid up members of the Rec family and we continue to mourn their loss.I would love to have name checked every single member of the Rec family in this piece but time and space didnrsquot allow. My apologies.The laughter which rang through Cootrsquos house during his wake was a fitting farewell for someone who loved to laugh.He was a very special human being. We will miss him forever.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityIt was girl power when ten female walkers joined Joy and sheepdog Bracken from Penarth and District Ramblers at Penarth clftop for an . mile walk, with no stiles only gates and which would see them experiencing the weather of all four seasons in one day. They set off on a socially distanced walk in lovely spring sunshine across the old pitch and putt course before joining part of the old railway line, now a walk and cycle way, and heading through a built up area Lavernock Road led them into Cosmeston Country Park.Past the eastern lake with its floating jetty where canoes can be safely launched and making their way through the eastern paddock with its carpet of pretty cowslips, open meadows led them towards Old Cogan Hall Farm, where they deviated into the churchyard of St Peterrsquos for morning break in glorious warm sunshine reminiscent of summer. Admiring the herring bone masonry which dates to Celtic and Saxon times and the ancient yew trees that could even pre-date this lovely old church, which allegedly is the oldest building in Penarth and hearing some of its long and interesting history, it fell into disrepair in the th century. By the th century the ruinous building was a cattle shelter until the latter part of the rsquos when the rd Marquis of Bute was persuaded to pay for its renovation.Mile Road built by the Bute family led them to the western paddock and through the sun-dappled Cogan Wood to re-enter fields where a footbridge led them across the Sully Brook for the short climb up to Home Farm, with its glorious views towards the eastern end of Barry and the surrounding farmland. Exiting through a gate, some road walking in a southerly direction brought them into Sully village and pounding pavements to reach the Jubilee Hall and the cricket field, the full beauty of Sully Bay with its views across the Bristol Channel towards the Somerset coastline and Hayes Point to the west confronted them.     With the wind beginning to pick up they tramped by track and field to the public slipway at Sully beach and stopped for lunch utilising rocks for seating whilst gazing eastwards towards Sully Island and Flat and Steep Holm beyond, as clouds thickened overhead and the temperature dropped making it feel more like autumn.Time to move on along part of the long distance Wales Coast Path, through the playing fields to exit onto Beach Road, following it to the car park of the Captainrsquos We where there were only a few people sitting at outdoor tables for food and drink, not really enjoyable in the cool breeze.The fairly quiet St Maryrsquos Well Bay Road brought them up past The Bay Caravan Park and into fields with growing crops where, without any warning a sudden short sharp shower of rain engulfed the group forcing coats to be swtly donned.Crossing a wooden footbridge into the delightful Lavernock Nature Reserve the grassy path led them into the remains of the WW gun emplacements. Initially in the late rsquos the original Lavernock Gun Battery was built to protect the Bristol and Cardf shipyards and the Bristol Channel, but unfortunately most of the original buildings now lie underneath the caravan park.Being bombarded by a short hail storm whilst moving on through the nature reserve, lovingly cared for by volunteers and passing the man-made pond with its surrounding carpet of bluish violet bugle, a plant which attracts moths, butterflies and bees, before exiting onto Fort Road their route led them past the Marconi Holiday Village and the Church of St Lawrence before heading along the clftop. With thick black clouds heading up the English side of the Bristol Channel, the race was on to get back before the rain hit. As the weather turned wintry and the wind increased, a huge shower of hailstones and heavy rain struck them on the open Penarth clftop soaking them as they made their way back to their start point.You can follow the grouprsquos exploits before, during and after lockdown on Facebook. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He raised concerns that the hundreds of new houses in and around Llantwit Major arenrsquot seeing the increased investment in local public services needed to cater for the growing population.He said: ldquoThere are more and more houses in the town. Therersquos hardly any green space left and our services are really struggling.Two doctors surgeries currently cater for the town: Coastal Vale and Western Vale. Cllr John claimed Coastal Vale is ldquoat capacity and the Western Vale building is ldquoover  years old.He said: ldquoThe actual building needs replacing, itrsquos not in a great condition. It needs replacing and modernising.Cardf and Vale UHB is drawing up plans for major changes on how clinical services are delivered. This will likely see three lsquohealth and wellbeing centresrsquo with services like x-rays, out-of-hours GPs, community mental health teams, and ambulatory care.MORE NEWS:The health board is also planning nine lsquowellbeing hubsrsquo, either developing existing places like health centres, leisure centres or libraries or in new buildings such as Maelfa in Cardf. These wellbeing hubs will include GP services, midwery, and primary mental health care.     The idea is to move clinical services away from large hospitals like the University Hospital of Wales, at the Heath in Cardf, avoiding the need for people to travel long distances for care.Cllr John supports this move but says residents in the western part of the Vale of Glamorgan are currently undeserved with health services mdash and with the hundreds of new houses being built in the area, Llantwit would be ideal for a new health centre.He is hoping to get many more signatures for his petition to build the new health centre in Llantwit Major, with a table set up on the precinct in the town on Saturday, for residents who arenrsquot on the internet or havenrsquot seen the campaign online yet.He said: ldquoItrsquos all very well building homes, thatrsquos fine. But we have to have the infrastructure.The health board said any investment in new health and wellbeing centres or wellbeing hubs is some time away.A Cardf and Vale UHB spokesperson said: ldquoThe intention is for a wellbeing hub to be placed in the western Vale, but this may be some years away as part of our overall plan. In terms of where the site will be based, this will be subject to an engagement process.ldquoThere will be a health and wellbeing centre in the Vale work will be commencing in terms of engagement in relation to this within the next few months.A Vale of Glamorgan council spokesperson said: ldquoAny need for a new medical centre would be a matter for the Cardf and Vale University Health Board.ldquoNo planning application for such a building has been submitted and currently the land in question has been allocated as a signicant strategic development site for the councilrsquos house building programme.
