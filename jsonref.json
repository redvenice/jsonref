The low number of positive tests means its estimates should be treated with caution.One of the Government\u0027s top scientific advisers said that, after reviewing the R rate study and ONS report, they think \u0027this is all probably trending upwards, very gently.\u0027 They warned more younger people were testing positive and suggested it was only a matter of time before they began to infect older citizens who are far more vulnerable to Covid-19\u0027s nasty symptoms.The ONS\u0027 daily infection predictions are much different to the Government\u0027s official daily count, released by the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) every afternoon. Testing data is collected by the ONS from swab tests sent regularly to people\u0027s homes to test whether they are infected with the virus at the time. The people are chosen to be representative of the UK population.The households taking part in the survey were tested for Covid-19 regardless of whether they had symptoms or not.Thousands of people become infected but never request a test and so go unreported in the DHSC\u0027s statistics. Going by the official metric, 1,051 Britons are now testing positive for the life-threatening disease each day, on average - which is half of what the ONS predicts.For comparison, the rolling average on Thursday was 1,043 and it had been falling every day since August 15, when the figure reached a six-week high of 1,097."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/91f29d61c10cc02ba03dfab64d8783edcc6a9971/0_393_5930_3560/master/5930.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b7efad45dc4cb5fa856f2a4424be1a30","title":"loved and lost simon bray photo essay","story":"Photographer Simon Bray’s project Loved and Lost deals with the loss of loved ones. He asked each participant to find a photograph of themselves with their lost loved one, and they returned to the location to replicate the image. The project aims to provide a platform, allowing others to acknowledge their loss, and to celebrate the person they loveDeath has a stigma and the burden of grief can hold us captive if we let it. May this be a process through which a loved one can be remembered and through which memories can be relived. Even though the pain of the loss may remain, may this go some way in relieving the hurt and the stigma of death and act as a public declaration that death has lost its sting.I ask each participant to find a photograph of themselves with their lost loved one. We then return to the location of the original photograph to replicate the image.It is a chance to think back and remember, to tell the story of that day and of the person that they have lost. Imagery allows for expression beyond what we can speak of. I hope it is an experience that contributes to the restorative process in overcoming the painful impact of loss.We all have a different experience of loss that can reveal itself in many ways. Sometimes it’s a response that is quite clear for those around you to see. Perhaps there are lots of emotions that they just don’t know how to let out, they’re not sure how they should be feeling or whether it’s right to be having certain angry or complicated thoughts.It’s not about having the best photo, saying the right thing or having the answers, I just want to give people a chance to speak about their experience of loss.My aim was that the combination of the photos we took and the conversations we had, we would be able to portray a deep personal story. This allows other people who are struggling and going through similar experiences to look through and find strength and comfort in the story, knowing that other people have been through it and are confident enough to share their story.I lost my father to prostate cancer in December 2009. When my dad died, it wounded me in the deepest part of my being. The loss shaped the following few years of my life and will continue to do so, but I don’t have to let it define who I am. Through this time, it was really helpful to be able to talk about my dad. I wanted to share with others about the person he was, the emotions I was feeling as I processed the grief, and talk about the influence he had – and continues to have – on my life. Those conversations were often hard and few and far between, mainly because people just didn’t quite know how to respond.I’m Alistair, and my dad was James. The original picture was from the beach at Swanage in Dorset. I’m not sure how old I was there, but it was a family holiday. We loved to go down there and find a pitch for the day, Mum and Dad would soak up the sun and me and Tim, my brother, would build sandcastles and splash around, and repeat until we had to go home.He was a very loving father, he provided for his family, looked after us. He taught me a lot of principles about always doing the best, always trying to be the nicest person and to make sure that others were looked after and cared for. When you look back you realise you’ve been prepared by your parents to live your life. Dad always just wanted to treat others how he’d want to be treated.When we got the dementia diagnosis, several years ago, we had noticed over time that he was getting more forgetful. He wouldn’t use my name, he was losing his hearing, his vision wasn’t great and I lost him as a dad over those years. I still loved him as my dad, but I knew I wasn’t necessarily going to get that reciprocated, which was tough. He still offered to help when I mentioned to him about moving flat he’d say “well let me know if you need a hand”. I think that’s just his character through and through and I always just try to emulate that.I went to see him in the care home and I said to the staff that I’d like to volunteer in the garden if possible, even if he wasn’t aware of me being there, I could just help out and spend some time with him, but then we went into lockdown and that was the last time I saw him when he was awake and alert.When the Covid thing came along, it was like losing him for a second time, but this time, obviously, for the last time. It was difficult because I had kind of processed losing him in a mental sense, and now I was losing him in a physical sense.I did get to see him before he passed away and it was just a completely different experience because I had to wear all the PPE. In the past, I’d just always assumed he’d be there for years to come and you don’t think about it ever being the last time, whereas I went there, got dressed up and they said you’ve got 15 minutes. It was horrible having this countdown clock, where you have this time limit on how long you have left with someone. I just set it on my watch and it’s just counting down. I was thinking, I’ve got 30 seconds left with my dad, 20 seconds left, 10 seconds left. What do I do? What do I say? And I just panicked.It made me reflect on how many times I’ve seen or called my parents and thought that maybe I’m quite busy and I haven’t really got time for this, but I’ll see them next week. I’ve gone away thinking that it’s OK that I didn’t see them for very long today because I’ll see them in the future.It’s given me a real appreciation for just taking a second to appreciate that when you’re with family or a friend, that you don’t know necessarily when you might see them again and that’s why you have to make the most of the time you have with them. I’m trying to act on it in a positive way, rather than just thinking about why I feel that way because of Dad.It’s absolutely OK to cry and be a blubbering mess sometimes. If you try to stop it, you’ll feel a lot worse. I know that particularly for men there’s this societal pressure to be a strong support and a rock for people, but for your own sake, for men and women, to let your body do what it needs to do. You want to cry because your brain is telling you that you need to process this, to not fight it but to let it happen, then you’ll feel that pressure is unloaded.My name is Jonathan. The picture of myself and dad was taken on Christmas Eve 2019. We’d had Christmas together for the previous 54 years and it was a tradition we never broke. It was a fabulous event, we went out for a meal and then came back and exchanged gifts here.My dad was 88 and he was getting old, things were failing. As a son it’s really upsetting when parents get older. I would do anything to try and make his life easier. I saw that he was walking badly and he said that the flesh on his feet was getting thinner and thinner and it was painful to walk. He’d never been into a Nike store, but he hobbled in, and then pretty soon we were having him trying on lots of pairs and we fitted him up with a pair of Nike Air Max. He was virtually running around the store, which was really lovely, really heartening. I felt as though I’d knocked off 10 or 15 years!He was so busy, I couldn’t keep up with him. I’m half his age, but he was out every night of the week. He would attend choirs, he was in the Greater Manchester Police Choir, the church choir, he was in Probus. I just don’t think he liked being at home.He was the person I’d known longest in my life, he was always there. He was a bit like Switzerland, he never really offered a view, but he was always there to support me and catch me if I fell or tripped. It’s three months since he died and I’ve spent the last three months going to call him every day. So it’s been difficult.He was the 12th coronavirus victim in the UK, so it was right at the very start. The health service and society as a whole didn’t know what to do. They didn’t know how to process and deal with the virus at that stage. So that was really difficult, because we couldn’t go to see him. We were only allowed to see him at the very end with lots of protective equipment, but if he hadn’t have had the coronavirus he probably would have been here today, because they would have treated his underlying health issues. It’s really, really difficult.He died on Friday 13th, which I just couldn’t believe. The last time I saw him, we’d had a chat and I’d said what a cool dad he was, that he’d done a really good job, and he said, “No, I don’t think I was that good”, which I thought was really sweet. I said goodbye to him and went into the anteroom, where I had to take off all the protective equipment. I was halfway through taking it off and he called me back, but I couldn’t go back because the room had a positive air pressure, so I’ll never know what he wanted me for. That went with him to the grave.It sounds really strange, but it’ll be very odd when the pandemic ends, because it has felt like a very intimate time, in that we went into shutdown and I could think about my dad’s experience, but it was like a shared experience with the whole of the world. I dread to think of other families going through the same thing that we went through. When someone dies of cancer or a heart attack, it’s dreadful, but that’s the moment. Whereas my dad died on the 13 March and from that point on, coronavirus has been on the news every minute of every hour of every day. It was like someone sticking a knife into the wound all the time, there was no escaping from it. As a family we felt properly battered.Normally if you suffer a bereavement you have the support of family and friends, and we couldn’t go and see anyone. We were in lockdown before the country, in our own lockdown, so it’s been a very lonely time. Every step along the way was difficult, it felt as though we were unfortunate pioneers. The first funeral director that we went to wouldn’t deal with us. It’s been unusual.At his funeral, we only had 10 people there and I liked it because it was nice and quiet. I’d discovered tapes of him singing so we actually played him singing a song on the way out and it made the hairs on the back of my neck stand up. That was really magical.My name is Philip and the photograph is of me and my parents. We bought this caravan in 2016, and they were very much part of our lives, so they would come for a weekend. We are in the very north of Anglesey. If you think of the island as a clock, then we’re at 1 o’clock, overlooking the most northerly lighthouse, Point Lynas.My dad was a travelling salesman for James Stewart and Co in Ardwick, opposite Manchester Apollo. His turf was Moss Side. He used to sell from a catalogue going door to door and he was well known in the area. He did that for 30-odd years.My mum brought us up, two boys who liked to fight and liked to be boys. She was also the bursar at the Ryleys school in Alderley Edge, and was very into amateur dramatics, so was part of the Wilmslow Green Room Society. She was in a lot of plays, then did a lot of backstage and in her older years did a lot of wardrobe, so there’s a team of six that meet every Tuesday to talk and sort the wardrobes out.Mum had coughs, she definitely had Covid.She was fit and healthy, walking a mile a day, in the drama group. Dad was playing golf and doing the garden, but he died of a broken heart, basically. Even though he did test positive, he never had a cough or any real symptoms. I lost both parents in 48 hours. My family is my world, so the only reassurance is that we were telling them to stay in, eat and have the paracetamol and do what the doctor says, that they’d get through it and to be strong.My brother still lived with my parents and had to give CPR to both of them. They were in lockdown, so even after both parents dying, Peter had to stay in the house for another five days and we weren’t allowed to visit. It’s all that stuff that you don’t hear about and have no idea what people are going through. To this day, he has not had any symptoms. He’s never been tested, nobody approached him, but he’s never had a day of illness. We were only allowed 10 people at the funeral when we could have had 200. We printed 100 orders of service and posted them out to different people, just so there was something for them to share on the day. We did a video, so we can share that with people, but obviously nobody got the funeral that they wanted.For the first three weeks after my parents died, I became a bit of a counsellor. People would ring me up and I’d have to explain everything and say well, we have to look for the silver lining in it all, we have to find something every day that helps and is a positive. We’ve done that, we have managed to find that glimmer, even little quirky things, memories of them, thoughts of them.I suppose the only comfort is that there isn’t an answer. There isn’t something that we could or should have done to make the result anything different than what it was, because nobody had that knowledge. Everybody was scared and there are still friends of my mum and dad that haven’t gone out.We summed it up quite nicely in that if somebody else came into the room, that person became the most important person. So it was never about them, they were the host and hostess. Drop everything, someone’s come in, what can I do for you, get you a drink, something to eat, oven on, and we’ll look after you, tell us what’s going on in your life, is there something we can help with?I used to sit and watch every United game with my dad, we were avid football fans and we’d chat away, so the first time I watched United I put a glass of white wine next to me. That’s what makes it tough sometimes, those chats, those little bits that fill in your week. It’s good to talk it out, you have to do that.I’m just so pleased that they saw both my daughters get firsts, graduate and be in the jobs they want to be in. They burst with pride about my girls. I’ve tried to do the best to acknowledge them and pay them tribute, and if we can be half the people they were, then we’re doing a good job."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8d7e0bf020385a47d51b259f390f24c6b68ddad6/419_222_2721_1632/master/2721.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b4632d1b8d55753fa79efb627847a603","title":"picture essay america 1930s post office murals","story":"Photographer Justin Hamel stumbled on a Great Depression-era mural one day in a New York post office, and was intrigued to learn there are 1,200 of them across the countryThe instinct to try to boost morale during a time of hardship and suffering resonates today as we face the pandemic and economic recession.Modeled on the 1933 Public Works Art Project, the federal government created the Treasury Section of Painting and Sculpture a year later (the name was subsequently changed to the Section of Fine Arts).These programs were designed to employ artists.The mission of the post office murals was multifaceted – to boost morale in communities, employ artists by the thousands and create world-class art that was accessible to everyone. The murals revolved around local folklore, landscapes, industry and, unsurprisingly, mail delivery. They told the story of life across the United States.The first mural I photographed occurred by happenstance – I stumbled upon a mural depicting the 1932 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid, New York. From there the project slowly grew, as I traveled around the country seeking out the unique art of the post office mural.I’ve now photographed about 325 inidual murals though I don’t have an actual tally.From the magnificent depiction of steam engines being built in the post office in Willard, Ohio, to a serene pondside landscape hanging in the sheriff’s office in Dale county, Alabama, or covered wagons crossing a stream in Crawford, Nebraska, each new mural I discovered offered an engaging view into the local histories of the world around us.In small towns everywhere, history was painted by people who arrived in America seeking a better life. Many of the artists employed by the Section were immigrants. José Aceves, a Mexican-American artist, painted the classic western scene Big City News in Borger, Texas.New and Old Methods of Transportation, showing how the rapid pace at which technology was changing rural towns, was painted by the Polish-American Bernard Zakheim in Mineola, Texas. In a Virginia post office lobby, you’ll find a factory valley landscape entitled Appalachia by Lucienne Bloch, a Swiss-born immigrant.As today’s national discussion in the US has shifted towards institutional racism and the place of art and statues commemorating the United States’ racist history, many post office murals are coming under scrutiny for the way they portray the colonization and slavery. Hollis Holbrook’s John Elliot Speaks to the Natick Indians depicts Native Americans enslaved by Puritans while John Elliot preaches Christianity to them.The city of Natick was founded as the first of many “praying towns” by the Massachusetts Bay Colony, where Native Americans would be forced to learn Christianity.However, the controversy surrounding post office murals is arguably nothing new. In the 1950s, a handful of artists were made to testify under the House committee on un-American activities for their celebration of labor and political undertones.Victor Arnautoff’s historic 10-panel The Life of Washington mural at the George Washington high school in San Francisco is in the midst of a fierce fight to be preserved, hidden or destroyed due to its depictions of George Washington as a slave owner and the dead Native Americans the country was founded upon. Hundreds of murals created under the Section of Fine Arts and the broader Works Progress Administration have been lost or purposely destroyed over the years.The Section of Fine Arts created roughly 1,400 murals and sculptures in federal buildings, not entirely post offices. The PWAP, Treasury Relief Art and Federal Art Project commissioned thousands of other paintings, posters, general art classes, etc, including post office murals.All wrapped into one, it is undoubtedly the largest public art project in the US. The most recent politicization of the post office has brought renewed focus to the ways the postal service is crucial to everyday life. Perhaps an unexpected consequence, scaling back hours and funding will also put this unparalleled collection of public art at risk.• Justin Hamel is a documentary and editorial photographer in El Paso, Texas, working at the intersections of climate, labor and migration."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/262bd47df0273479ce12d1d4acff1b965c4f27a8/98_0_2805_1684/master/2805.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=afd758df1e35b1129e4b16cea55a4e28","title":"matt herron chronicler of the us civil rights movement in pictures","story":"The photographer, who covered protesters and volunteers across the south, has died at 89.

But as infection rates have risen again in parts of the region, some earlier curbs have been reinstated.The latest data, which was published on Friday and focused on the services and manufacturing sectors, is likely to concern policymakers and diminish hopes for a V-shaped recovery, signalling slowing growth. IHS Markit’s flash composite purchasing managers’ index (PMI) fell from 54.9 in July to 51.6. Any number above 50 signals growth.“The fallback in the eurozone composite PMI in August suggests the initial V-shaped rebound following the lifting of the lockdowns is already fizzling out,” said Jessica Hinds at Capital Economics.The flow of new business for firms slowed and once again some of August’s activity was derived by companies completing work backlogs. Germany and France, the bloc’s two biggest economies, also lost economic momentum this month, driven by a services slowdown.Apart from those economies, activity decreased marginally in August, IHS Markit said.Growth in the eurozone’s dominant service sector stalled, with the its PMI index falling to 50.1 from 54.7.With demand waning, the bloc’s services firms cut headcount for a sixth month in a row, and more sharply than in July. Economists noted the employment components of the PMIs suggested more gloom ahead in the jobs market.“Those numbers indicate that the worst is yet to be seen in the euro area labour market and clearly points to a gradual recovery path,” said Tuuli Koivu at Nordea Markets.Factory activity – which did not experience quite as sharp a decline as the service industry during the height of the pandemic – expanded for a second month.But in a sign that factory purchasing managers do not expect a big pick up in activity, they again bought fewer raw materials than in the previous month.EU leaders agreed last month a €750bn (£674bn) pandemic recovery fund, but the relief does not kick in until next year. For its part, the European Central Bank is expected to keep monetary policy ultra-loose for a long time.A full bounceback from the eurozone’s deepest recession on record will take two years or more, according to a recent Reuters poll of economists."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7b5800a570370eb6a4dbf095a2696104bab8d9a/0_379_5758_3456/master/5758.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=138856ccdc90414b0c143483737751c0","title":"five factors behind the us stock markets miraculous turnaround","story":"Despite looking anything but fearless as Covid-19 first struck, US markets have regained lost ground and reached new highs. We list the reasons whyNothing like the recovery in the US stock market has ever been seen before. After the Wall Street Crash of 1929, the time it took for shares to regain their previous peak was measured in decades. After the global financial crisis of 2008, it was measured in years. This time it has taken less than five months – from a low on 23 March – for the S\u0026ampP 500 to regain all its lost ground and hit a new high. At the time, not even the most bullish trader would have been bet on such a rapid recovery, but five factors explain the remarkable turnaround.Even while the market was crashing in early March, America’s central bank was acting to reassure investors that it would go to any lengths to support the world’s biggest economy and prevent a financial crisis.As in the aftermath of the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008, the Fed moved swiftly: it cut interest rates to zero it promised to pump $5 trillion into the troubled money markets it created lending programmes to help the cash flow of US businesses big and small it bought corporate bonds and it has given the impression that it may buy stocks as well.Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global, says the rally on Wall Street and the recent fall in the US dollar are “being driven primarily by central bank policies of adding unprecedented liquidity to markets through renewed quantitative easing and ultra-low rates.”The lockdown has been disastrous for some sectors, notably hospitality and airlines, but people stuck at home have been spending more time online, shopping, watching, socialising and working. That has been good news for the five big US tech giants – Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Google and Netflix.Dhaval Joshi, analyst at BCA research, says the S\u0026ampP 500 should be renamed the S\u0026ampP 5 because it is now so dominated by a handful of companies. Likewise, about 10 stocks – mostly in finance and energy – drive the UK’s FTSE 100.Traditionally, Wall Street looks beyond the short term and anticipates that a company’s earnings – on which its stock market valuation ultimately depends – will recover.However, some investors, including Norway’s massive sovereign wealth fund, say this is risky at a time when Covid-19 is not beaten. Trond Grande, the fund’s deputy chief executive, said markets did not reflect the real economic impact of the virus, which was not under control “in any shape or form”.The devastating economic impact of Covid-19 has meant a worldwide race to find a vaccine. Normally this takes years, but there are hopeful signs – including from researchers at Oxford University – that the process could be speeded up.Wall Street has proved highly sensitive to reports of a possible breakthrough, from either US biotech companies such as Gilead or foreign rivals. But even on the most optimistic assumption, a vaccine will not be widely available until 2021 at the earliest, and the chances of failure are high. But for the past few months, vaccine optimism has helped boost not just pharma shares but Wall Street stocks generally.In the early stages of the pandemic, investors dumped shares and parked their money in traditional safe havens such as cash and US treasury bonds. But the actions of the Fed and other central banks have made these options less attractive.Interest rates for savers are barely above zero, and in some countries the interest rates (yields) on government bonds have turned negative, which means investors have to pay the state for the privilege of putting their money in a safe asset.For investors who believe shares are overvalued, there is gold, whose price has risen by almost $400 an ounce in the past six months."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e36fc8a16ec54184a96153f7a0e37ef4c4970409/0_0_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9be4b09847330ba050eb22001140ede6","title":"journeys end last of englands open cast mines begins final push","story":"Hartington site in Derbyshire will be allowed to eke out last of its coal over rest of year owing to pandemicFew in the small town of Staveley, near Chesterfield, could have predicted that an overlooked industrial site on its outskirts would play host to the end of thousands of years of coal mining in England.The Hartington site stands unassumingly within the green hills of Derbyshire where it produces a small handful of coal, in industry terms, alongside gravel and construction grit. It is also, by chance, England’s last open-cast coal mine in a history that dates back to Roman times.The Hartington site can trace its roots in the mining industry back more than 140 years to when it first began producing coal for the Staveley Coal and Iron Company in 1875. Then, the company’s 3,000 workers produced 1m tonnes of coal a year. Today, Hartington is a minnow within the fast-draining coal industry and aims to produce a total of 87,000 tonnes.Government officials had expected Hartington to reach its modest target by the start of August, but delays caused by the coronavirus has meant the mine will be allowed to continue to eke out the last of its coal for the rest of the year.By sheer chance Hartington will outlive England’s far larger surface mines, including Bradley in County Durham which shut on Monday  after extracting 340,000 of 500,000 tonnes of coal earmarked when it opened in 2018.John Wilson, a local businessman, owns Hartington alongside interests in local hotels and a recycling company.The last open-cast mine in England will continue to produce coal alongside a handful of mines still operating in Wales and Scotland, and a few small underground mines in Cumbria and the Forest of Dean.These mines may tap the same rich coal seams that helped power the Industrial Revolution, but they are a dusty shadow of one of the country’s most enduring industry. At its peak in 1913, Britain produced 292m tonnes of coal a year. Last year, a record low of 2.2m tonnes was produced after 35 years of accelerating mine closures.It has been almost five years since 60 miners emerged for the final time from Britain’s last deep mine at Kellingley in North Yorkshire. The closure of the mine, which survived the Thatcher years and countless union strikes, marked yet another blow to the communities of former mining towns in the north of England.The Hartington mine was one of the earliest casualties of the terminal decline in heavy industry after the first world war, shutting in 1921 after a miner strike before taking up a new life as a tip for other local mines and steel foundries.At the centre of Staveley’s market square stands a clocktower monument to the town’s industrial past, but few are here to see it today. Since the collapse of industry in Staveley the town has emptied. The woes of its remaining small businesses have been compounded by recession, years of austerity, and the collapse of the British high street.The owner of the nearby cobbler, who gave his name as Bobbo, said the exodus from the town centre had accelerated as young people left Staveley to find work. “The politicians say they understand that things are difficult in former industrial towns, but they keep putting money in the pockets of foreign workers by importing everything. So, isn’t that hypocritical?” he said.Today, the UK imports of 6m tonnes of coal a year, mostly from Russian mines, despite the collapse in demand for coal in the production of steel and energy in power plants. It is a fact seized upon by those hoping to spur a coal mining renaissance in the UK despite the government’s climate targets.Government ministers are considering plans for new open-cast mines, and caused dismay among environmental groups late last year by waiving through plans – still fiercely opposed – for the first new deep cast mine in a generation at the Woodhouse colliery in Cumbria.A government spokesman told the  that although Britain’s transition towards a low carbon future had “inevitably reduced the country’s dependence on coal extraction and use”, the government was “supporting the creation of new, sustainable employment opportunities in the green economy, which is predicted to support 2 million jobs by 2030”.For Britain’s former mining towns, a green industrial boom cannot come soon enough."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/18d9b0761a5eb7aec45ae16e4a09d2d347d9bde3/0_33_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9ef55aa6e42a0187b88aa5b314a86fb2","title":"we knew they were experts sta clients and staff look back covid 19","story":"As company falls victim to Covid-19, travellers reflect on joy of experienced people helping to book holidaysNews that STA Travel has become the latest to fall victim to the Covid-19 pandemic has prompted an outpouring of sadness and nostalgia from former customers and staff.Known for its enthusiastic staff and its budget round-the-world plane tickets, generations of students would flock to STA Travel stores to book gap years and summer breaks through the company – or simply to gaze longingly at the adventures it promised.Its bright yellow and blue signage has been a familiar sight on high streets and university campuses for decades, but now after it confirmed it had ceased trading on Friday, 54 UK stores look set to close their doors, putting 500 jobs at risk.Lowri Lloyd Owen from near Aberystwyth worked for the company for 10 years, first as a travel expert and then as a store manager.

The job enabled her to move to Australia, where she lived for eight years and started her family.“The 10 years I spent working for this company taught me so much, took me to places far and wide and I met lifelong friends along the way, many of whom are still employees and will be facing very difficult times ahead,” she said. “Selling travel is the most awesome thing you can sell someone.”She was not surprised by the reaction to the news. “Whether you were an STA customer or an employee, it was a company that supported young people often at the start of their travels or career and that stays with you,” she said.Tim Walker, who runs Beaumont Music and lives in West Sussex, was one of the company’s loyal customers when he was a student in the early 2000s. He used the travel agent from the age of 18 to 22 to book his gap-year adventure as well as summer trips while at university.“I remember booking flights to Mexico and the staff member calling over a colleague who had just returned from their own trip.

I had always wanted to do it and I asked a couple of friends to go but they didn’t want to. So I was a little discouraged, but decided to go anyway.”STA Travel made her feel more comfortable about going on her own. They produced flyers about solo travel for women, which Adewa-Faboro studied before going. “I was a solo traveller, aged 19, and my family in Nigeria thought I was crazy. But I thought I only live once so I just decided to do it. STA made me feel really safe about it. I had six magical days there.“The team were amazing in making a foreign student from Nigeria’s dream come true. Money was tight so they booked me into two separate hostels to save me money. They were brilliant.”It wasn’t just students booking gap years and post-university travels. STA Travel, founded by two Australian backpackers in Melbourne in 1979, originally stood for Student Travel Australia, but it branched out to a wider customer base and rebranded itself to become Start the Adventure.“I remember going to their store in Covent Garden and a lovely lady – Annie, I think – helped us plan out the whole trip.”Butler, who runs the Sugar Tea Room in north London, said: “We were both sad to hear about STA travel closing because it wasn’t just for students, they had the best prices for long-haul travel.”Afsaneh Parvizi-Wayne, the founder of the period product brand Freda, who lives in London, has fond memories of using STA Travel to go to the Gambia, Senegal and Guinea Bissau when she was a student more than 30 years ago.She said: “We used to have an STA in the University of London Union in the 80s when we still had holiday brochures and you could discuss your trip in person with someone who’d probably done that trip already. It wasn’t just the student discount but also the student perspective and tips in a non-internet era. I’m so sad to see it go.”Another former customer, Ellie Dix, a board game designer from Hertfordshire, has been reminiscing about Camp America, which she booked through STA Travel in the 90s.“I was at Birmingham University from 1994 to 1997 and we had an STA Travel on campus. I remember going and just gazing at the options as a sort of escapism from student life. I did Camp America for two years running in 1996 and 1997 and STA dealt with the travel.“I don’t remember actually thinking there was any other way to travel as a student other than with STA. It was STA or nothing.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8cab1ecf99777d61a4c6f71aa0bf1bee4d285864/0_209_7000_4200/master/7000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=49c1fa0ade57669f9c2bb37a0fa945b0","title":"teachers and parents across the uk share your thoughts on the reopening of schools","story":"We’d like to hear from people in England, Wales and Northern Ireland about returning to schools, and those in Scotland about how it has beenWith just weeks to go until children return to school in England and Wales, and less than a week until the first cohort of students in Northern Ireland return for the start of the new academic year, protective measures in schools remain fiercely contested.Many teachers have criticised the government’s ‘bubble’ group scheme and social distancing measures, while some unions have called for teachers to be able to choose to use face coverings, against government advice.

Ordinarily, joining in with extracurricular activities on campus is a sure way for new students to meet like-minded people and make friends – but the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic this year means the situation for incoming freshers may be a little different.Students’ unions across the country face new dilemmas: what will the student experience look like come September? Is it possible to truly replicate the same social-bonding activities in an online-only world?While the future may be uncertain, the answer to this second question, according to Jake Verity, a 2019 University of Sheffield graduate who is now president of the university’s students’ union, is a resounding yes. “As soon as the lockdown measures came in, we got to work on building up a big online community through Facebook,” he says. “The response has been amazing – 2,000 students joined within 24 hours – and societies have adapted really well to the new way of doing things, without needing any encouragement from us.”Students who would once meet in the pub or on the football field have organised online baking tutorials, yoga and dance sessions, as well as social support meetings for club members to talk through their fears and anxieties. Sports societies unable to practise together have filled the time by setting up group challenges and fundraisers. “The athletics team ran the length of the UK in a day between them for charity, which was also a great way to raise morale,” says Verity.Given that today’s students are already used to socialising online, and many connect through social media ahead of moving into halls and starting courses, the social shift faced by student clubs and societies may not feel so massive.Where once students would stroll through freshers’ fairs, picking up leaflets and a plethora of free pens and tote bags, it’s likely this year’s student intake will browse extracurricular options online. Sheffield University was quick to put together a film showcasing the range of social clubs on offer to incoming students, and other universities are making similar efforts to recruit new society members online.According to David Lavallee, a sports professor at Abertay University, the fact that students might not be able to train as a team or use most of the facilities should not be a barrier to those considering joining up at uni this year. “This is exactly the time to be signing up to a sports team or club, as they provide established networks of support,” he says.The benefits of being part of a society or team go far beyond fitness and socialising, he adds. “Our research has shown how the transferable skills learned through sport, including communication and leadership, can make students more employable. These things, alongside learning collaboration skills, will be key for employability in a post-Covid-19 world.”At a time when social activity is limited, there can be added pressure on students to feel they are using their free time productively. But it’s important that students find a balance between social and career-related options, advises Laura Regan, a member of the student services team at Imperial College London.“It’s important for students to remember that their degree in itself will be enticing to employers and it’s OK to take advantage of the many unique social and fun opportunities universities offer,” she says. “My advice to any incoming students would be: don’t be afraid of trying new things. It takes time to strike a balance between work and socialising, and that process is all part of the university experience.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1fd77e5e211a5f01aff05f528265bdf0b70e2c2c/0_208_2140_1282/master/2140.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6fe26fadd1afa80188586e2402f830e7","title":"the a levels fiasco podcast","story":"When schools in England closed in March in response to the coronavirus pandemic, it meant students could no longer take their final exams.

Rather than being judged by their exam performance, their grades had been assigned by a computer model that took into account their previous achievements and that of their school.  As Laura McInerney tells Mythili Rao, while at first glance the results last week looked in line with a normal school year, glaring anomalies and what looked to be huge injustices emerged. As pressure built on the government to explain itself, ministers went silent before the education secretary emerged on Monday to announce a major U-turn.

I have been singing the praises of cauliflowers, tomatoes, lemons and the mighty aubergine for years. But while it’s my mission to present vegetables in new and exciting ways, I must confess to a niggling doubt: how many more ways are there to roast a cauliflower, slice a tomato, squeeze a lemon or fry an aubergine?The answer, I’m delighted to report, is many, and in my latest foray, I have been joined by my brilliant colleague and co-writer Ixta Belfrage. Our journey of discovery into the world of vegetables has focused on understanding what makes each one distinct, so they can be tasted afresh. It’s about creating flavour bombs, and it’s done in these three ways.One way to ramp up flavour in a vegetable is to subject it to a process before or during cooking. Three recipes in our new book involve cooking celeriac whole for more than two hours, then dressing and serving it in different ways. During the initial cooking, something magical happens. Much of the water in the celeriac evaporates it turns golden brown, and becomes sweeter and richer. This caramelising is key. Whatever you choose to do – if anything – after this is less important the browning process is such a flavour bomb that the celeriac is heavenly eaten at this stage, cut into wedges and served with a squeeze of lemon or a dollop of creme fraiche. Other processes that elevate vegetables to great heights include charring, ageing and infusing.It’s not so much what you do to an ingredient (“process”) or the ingredient itself (“produce”), but the combination of ingredients in the four most important pairings.Acidity Acidic substances can act as preservatives, improve texture (causing vegetables to cook more slowly and toughen up) and, best of all, balance flavours. A favourite sandwich of ours – a mix of olive oil-roasted vegetables and chillies, piled on toasted sourdough with pecorino shavings or crumbled feta on top – wouldn’t hit the spot without the acidic element counteracting the sweetness and chilli heat.Chilli heat Fresh, pickled, dried, flaked, in pastes, oils, butters and spice mixes: our kitchen is crowded with varities of chilli because the question, “What’s needed?” in a dish is so often answered with “chilli heat”. Chillies’ great gift is their ability to marry together a range of flavours to create a singular harmony.Sweetness All ingredients are a mix of things – sweet and salty, sweet and savoury – and these tastes need each other in order to shine. What would bitter cocoa powder be without sweet sugar? Satisfaction is about the combination, the layering, the contrast of tastes. With sweetness in particular, without the complexity, you run the risk of turning your dish into a dessert. Fat Take a simple salad – tomato and basil, say – and it’s one thing: sweet, refreshing and lovely. Add mozzarella, though, or tangy feta, and it becomes something entirely different. It’s no longer just the picture: it’s the entire summer holiday. Add another layer of fat in the form of olive oil and the dish is complete.In some cases, there’s so much going on within the ingredient that it can pretty much do all the work on its own, its deliciousness teased out by baking or toasting or frying.Such ingredients are often intensely savoury, and rich in the fifth flavour, umami (the others are sweet, sour, salty and bitter), the result of flavour compounds called glutamates. Unlike monosodium glutamate (chemically manufactured and liberally sprinkled over takeaways), there are many natural sources: parmesan, anchovies, mushrooms, tomatoes, soy sauce, seaweed, Marmite and ketchup.After years of cooking vegetables, I never cease to be surprised by their chameleon-like ability to take on flavour and metamorphose from one dish to the next. A simple cauliflower can reinvent itself, showing up as a seductive Levantine fritter, then grilled with saffron and raisins, disguised as bulgur in a modern take on tabbouleh, followed by a glamorous savoury cake, a meaty steak, dressed as (coronation) chicken or simply served whole, grilled yet unadorned. This is how wide the range and how wondrous the potential of every single vegetable. Magical, to borrow a term favoured by my five-year-old son.Preparing vegetables hasselback involves slicing them thinly, but not all the way down, so the slices remain held together at the base, like a fan: they not only look great but have deliciously crispy edges all over.To offset the extra work, start with shop-bought ready-cooked beetroots (plain, not in vinegar). If you do end up using raw beets, try to get bunches and use the stems and leaves to make our tempura stems, leaves and herbs.Serves 4 as a side8-10 medium-large beetroots (that’s about 2 bunches), skin on (1.2kg) or 8-10 ready-cooked beetroots (1kg)Flaked sea saltFor the lime leaf butter90g unsalted butter40ml olive oil5 fresh kaffir lime leaves, chopped10g fresh ginger, peeled and chopped1 garlic clove, crushed1 tbsp lime juice, plus 2 tsp to serveFor the lime leaf salsa10 fresh kaffir lime leaves, stalks removed and very finely chopped½ tsp fresh ginger, peeled and very finely chopped½ garlic clove, crushed½ green chilli, very finely chopped (deseeded for less heat)1 tbsp coriander leaves, chopped3 tbsp olive oilFor the yoghurt cream80ml double cream90g Greek-style yoghurtHeat the oven to 220C (200C fan) 425Fgas 7. Place the beets in a baking dish in a single layer. Fill with water to 2cm up the sides, sprinkle on one tablespoon of salt, cover tightly with foil and bake for one hour and 20 minutes, or until a knife goes through easily. Discard water and, when cool enough, peel off the skin under cold running water (wear gloves to avoid staining). Halve larger beetroots lengthways. Reduce oven temperature to 190C.While the beetroots are cooking, put the butter, oil, lime leaves, ginger and garlic into a small pan on a medium-high heat. Gently cook until the butter begins to bubble, about four minutes, then set aside to infuse for at least 40 minutes. Discard the aromatics, then stir in one tablespoon of lime juice and one teaspoon of flaked salt.For the salsa, mix all the ingredients in a small bowl with a quarter-teaspoon of flaked salt, and set aside.In a medium bowl, whip the cream, yoghurt and a pinch of flaked salt until light and fluffy, with medium-stiff peaks, about three minutes. Refrigerate until ready to use.Cut slits in the peeled beetroots at 4mm intervals, stopping about 1cm from the bottom. Place on a small parchment-lined baking tray and fan the slices out. Spoon the melted butter evenly over, especially between the slices. Roast for one and a quarter hours, basting very well every 20 minutes or so, until the edges are crisp and caramelised. Set aside to cool for 15 minutes.Spread the yoghurt cream on a platter, then arrange the beets on top, spooning the butter over. Drizzle over the salsa, finish with remaining lime juice and serve at once.Huge quantities of beets are roasted across the Ottolenghi restaurants, so we’re always on the lookout for clever ways of using the stems and leaves. If you don’t have any, use basil, parsley, sage or chard. Just make sure the leaves are not limp and wet, or hard and dry. The batter will be enough for 100g of leaves and herbs.Make sure your prep is done before the oil gets too hot and have a slotted spoon and a rack lined with kitchen paper at the ready. Tempura doesn’t sit too well, so try to eat it right away.Serves 6 as a snack or a little starter70g beetroot leaves and stems (cut to 8cm lengths), washed and patted dry20g dill, patted dry, in 8cm fronds10g mint, patted dry, leaves picked½ tbsp Szechuan peppercorns, crushed with a pestle and mortarFlaked sea saltFor the tangerine dipping sauce50ml tangerine juice, with bits (from 2-3 tangerines)3 tbsp lime juice1½ tsp maple syrup ½ small garlic clove, finely chopped4 fresh kaffir lime leaves, stalks discarded and leaves finely chopped½ red chilli, deseeded and choppedFor the batter80g self-raising flour80g cornflour, plus 50g for dipping210ml ice-cold sparkling water (small bits of ice welcome)1½ tbsp black sesame seeds700ml sunflower oil, for deep-fryingIn a small serving bowl, stir together all the dipping sauce ingredients with an eighth of a teaspoon of flaked salt, and set aside.For the batter, put the flour, 80g of cornflour, water, one teaspoon of flaked salt and the seeds into a large bowl. Whisk gently until the mixture just comes together.Pour the oil into a medium high-sided saute pan and place on a high heat. Once very hot, lower to medium and test by dropping in a little batter it should sizzle but not brown straight away. In batches, toss stems, leaves and herbs in the 50g of cornflour, shake to remove any excess, then dip in the batter. Lift, shake the excess over the bowl, then place as many pieces in the oil as can comfortably fit without touching. Fry for 30-60 seconds on each side, until crisp and pale golden, then use a slotted spoon to transfer to a kitchen paper-lined rack. Continue with the rest, then sprinkle the lot with the pepper and salt. Transfer to a platter and serve hot with the dipping sauce alongside.In 2016, the German minister for agriculture wanted to ban naming vegetable-based foods after their meaty counterparts, claiming terms such as “vegetarian schnitzel” were unsettling and misleading. Ours aren’t vegetarian schnitzels, they are vegetable ones – a semantic difference but a big one. In any case, we hope our choice of title does not offend.The sauce is a take on the classic Marie Rose but turbocharged. It’s also great in sandwiches and will keep in the fridge for up to a week. Serves 4 as a starter8 red Romano peppers (850g)Salt, flaked sea salt and black pepper100g plain flour4 eggs, beaten100g panko breadcrumbs60g sesame seeds, white andor black16 fresh kaffir lime leaves, stalks discarded and leaves finely chopped1 tbsp nori sprinkles (or blitz a sheet of nori in a spice grinder and use 1 tbsp)600ml sunflower oil, for deep-frying2 limes: finely grate the zest to get 2 tsp, then cut into wedges to serveFor the Marie Rose sauce 1 whole head of garlic, top fifth cut off to expose the clovesSalt and black pepper180g cherry tomatoes4 large red chillies (75g)1 tbsp maple syrup2 tsp Worcestershire sauce½ tsp chipotle flakes60g mayonnaiseHeat the oven to 250C (230C fan)480Fgas 9½. To make the sauce, sprinkle the garlic with salt and pepper, wrap in foil and place on a parchment-lined baking tray with the tomatoes and chillies. Roast for 30 minutes, until they begin to blacken and blister. Remove from oven and, when cool, squeeze the garlic into the small bowl of a food processor, discarding the skins. Add the chillies (deseeded for less heat), tomatoes, maple syrup, Worcestershire sauce, chipotle flakes and a quarter-teaspoon of salt blitz to a coarse paste. Leave to cool, then mix in the mayonnaise and refrigerate until you’re ready to serve.Meanwhile, cut a 5cm slit vertically in the base of each pepper, then place on a large parchment-lined baking tray (you can roast them at the same time as the garlic, near the bottom of the oven). Roast for 16 minutes, turning over halfway, until cooked through and beginning to blacken. Transfer to a sieve, cut side down, to drain any liquid, taking care to keep the stalks intact. Once cool, carefully peel away as much skin as possible without puncturing the flesh, then sprinkle with salt and set aside.Prepare three shallow containers long enough to fit the peppers. In the first, mix flour with one teaspoon of flaked salt and plenty of black pepper put the eggs in the second in the last mix breadcrumbs, sesame seeds, lime leaves, nori, two teaspoons of flaked salt and a generous grind of pepper.Set a large metal rack over one tray and line another with plenty of kitchen paper. Dip each pepper first into the flour, then the egg and finally the panko mixture, shaking off any excess as you go lie it on the rack and repeat with the rest of the peppers.Pour the oil into a large, high-sided saute pan or wok on a medium-high heat. Once very hot, fry the peppers two at a time so you don’t overcrowd them. Lower in carefully and fry for one and a half to two minutes on each side, until golden brown and crisp, then transfer to the paper-lined tray.Serve at once, with lime zest and sea salt sprinkled on top, and lime wedges and Marie Rose sauce alongside.Lime, chilli and garlic are the key flavours here, coming through the oil and the crispy sprinkle at the end. If using dried beans, soak a day ahead with tinned or jarred, add to the cooked shallots with 60ml of water and cook just until heated through.Serves 4 as a side2 banana shallots, finely chopped 2 garlic cloves, crushed4 fresh kaffir lime leaves1 ancho chilli, torn in halfSalt350g black turtle beans, soaked all night in cold water with 1 tsp bicarb of soda (or 800g cooked beans)3 tbsp lime juice½ small coconut, roughly grated (50g)For the fried aromatics 90ml olive oil 2 garlic cloves, thinly sliced2 red chillies, thinly sliced in rounds10 fresh kaffir lime leaves2 tsp black mustard seedsStart with the aromatics. Heat oil in a small pan on a medium-high heat. Once hot, reduce heat to medium, add garlic, chillies and lime leaves, and fry for two minutes, stirring. Add mustard seeds and fry for another 30 seconds, until the garlic starts to turn golden brown. Strain over a bowl. Set aromatics and oil aside separately.For the beans, put three tablespoons of reserved oil into a medium pan on a medium-high heat add shallots, garlic, lime leaves, ancho chilli and one and a quarter teaspoons of salt. Reduce heat to medium and fry for six minutes, stirring often, until the shallots are soft and golden. Rinse beans, then add to pan with 700ml water. Bring to a simmer, lower heat to medium and cook for 40 minutes, stirring occasionally, until cooked but still holding their shape. Remove from heat, cover and leave for 10 minutes.Transfer to a lipped platter or large, shallow bowl. Discard lime leaves and ancho chilli. Drizzle over lime juice and remaining oil, top with coconut and fried aromatics, and serve.We urge you to try our version of rasam, a South Indian broth, despite the longish ingredient list, to discover a whole range of new flavours.Use tamarind pulp, not paste (available in any Indian supermarket), to get the sweet acid kick you’re after.You’ll need to soak the rice for an hour in water. The balls can be made ahead and kept refrigerated in a sealed container return to room temperature before pouring over the hot broth.Serves 4 as a main50g block of tamarind pulp30g ginger, skin on, thinly sliced15g turmeric, skin on, thinly sliced1 large green chilli, roughly slicedSalt250g cherry tomatoes2½ tbsp sunflower oil½ lemon, halved lengthways, cut into ¼cm-thick half-moons (pips removed)1½ tsp cumin seeds, finely crushed1 tsp black mustard seeds2 whole dried red chillies20 fresh curry leaves (optional)3 garlic cloves, crushed3-4 plum tomatoes (300g), coarsely grated and skins discarded (250g)2 tsp caster sugarFor the rice balls200g Thai sticky rice, soaked for 1 hour in cold water, then drained well2 tbsp sunflower oil, plus extra for shaping1 onion, peeled and finely chopped 2 garlic cloves, crushed15g fresh ginger, peeled and grated10g coriander, roughly chopped, plus extra picked leaves and stalks2 spring onions, thinly sliced (30g)For the rasam, add the first four ingredients, 1.2 litres of water and one teaspoon of salt to a medium pan on a medium-high heat. Bring to the boil, then simmer gently for 20 minutes, stirring to break apart the pulp. Push through a sieve into a bowl, then discard the aromatics.Meanwhile, put rice in a medium pan with 220ml water and three-quarters of a teaspoon of salt. Bring to the boil on medium-high heat, then lower heat and cover loosely, leaving a small gap for steam to escape. Cook for 20 minutes, then remove from heat and let sit, uncovered, until cool.Toss cherry tomatoes in one and a half teaspoons of oil. Place a large saute pan on a high heat. Once smoking, add tomatoes and cook, tossing occasionally, until charred and blistered, about four minutes. Set aside. Add lemons and cook until charred, 30-50 seconds a side. Set aside. Turn heat down to medium-high, add remaining oil, cumin and mustard seeds, dried chillies, curry leaves and garlic, and cook for 90 seconds, until fragrant. Add grated plum tomatoes cook for five minutes more, then add sugar, tamarind liquid, charred tomatoes and half a teaspoon of salt. Bring back to the boil and simmer for eight minutes. Set aside while you prepare the rice balls.Put the oil into a saute pan on a medium-high heat. Add onion and cook for seven minutes, until soft and browned. Add garlic and ginger, and cook for 90 seconds. Remove from heat and transfer to a bowl with the cooked rice, coriander and spring onion. Mix well. With lightly oiled hands, form into 12 balls (30-35g each).To serve, heat through the rasam, then add charred lemon slices. Divide rice balls between four bowls, pour over the rasam and top with coriander.These onions are a revelation, and the very definition of low efforthigh impact. Two things are vital, though: the roasting tray must be big enough to fit 16 onion halves (if not, roast fewer, decreasing other ingredients proportionally) and these must be basted well, so they remain moist. Serve spooned over toast, mashed potatoes or rice, or with roast chicken.Serves 6 as a sideHeat the oven to 260C (240C fan)500Fgas 10. Halve the onions lengthways, trim tops and a little off the bottom (you want the halves held together at the base).Whisk butter, miso and one litre of warm water until fully combined.Space apart the onion halves, cut side down, in a 40cm x 28cm high-sided baking tray or dish. Pour over the miso water, cover tightly with foil, bake for 35 minutes, then remove foil and turn onions cut side up. Baste well and cook, uncovered, for 45 minutes, basting every 10 minutes, until very soft and deep brown.Carefully transfer to a platter, pouring sauce over. Serve at once.This is as fresh as a potato salad will get, thanks to the large quantities of lime, garlic, chilli and Thai basil poured over it. It will make a good light supper with broccoli and will also partner well with salmon or roast chicken.If you can’t get hold of Thai basil, use an equal combination of coriander and ordinary basil. The salsa won’t stay bright green for long, so make it just before you’re ready to serve.When jerusalem artichokes are in season, we like to roast them and add to this salad. If you’re not a fan, substitute them with the same amount of potatoes (in which case they’ll all be boiled, so no need to turn on the oven).Serves 4 as a side600g small to medium salad potatoes (or 1.1kg, if you’re not using jerusalem artichokes), peeled and cut into 3-4cm pieces Salt and flaked sea salt 600g jerusalem artichokes, peeled and cut into 3cm pieces (500g)  75ml olive oil 50g breakfast radishes, thinly sliced 3 limes: finely grate the zest to get 1¼ tbsp, then juice to get 3 tbsp 1 small garlic clove, roughly chopped 15g fresh ginger, peeled and roughly chopped 28g Thai basil, 20g roughly chopped, the rest picked leaves to serve 1 large green chilli, finely sliced into rounds 30g smoked, ready-roasted and salted almonds, roughly chopped (or ordinary ready-roasted almonds) Membership Event: Flavour, with Yotam Ottolenghi and Ixta Belfrage Heat the oven to 230C (210C fan)450Fgas 8 (if roasting artichokes). Put the potatoes into a large pan, cover with cold, salted water, bring to a simmer, then cook for around 10 minutes, or untilcooked through but still holding their shape. Drain and set aside to cool for 15 minutes.Meanwhile, mix artichokes (if using) with one tablespoon of oil and half a teaspoon of flaked salt, and spread out on a parchment-lined baking tray. Bake for 18-20 minutes, tossing halfway through, until golden brown and cooked through. Leave to cool for a few minutes, then put into a large bowl with the cooled potatoes.While the artichokes are roasting, mix the radishes with one tablespoon of the lime juice and a quarter-teaspoon of flaked salt, and set aside.In a spice grinder or the small bowl of a food processor, blitz the lime zest, garlic, ginger and the 20g of Thai basil with one teaspoon of flaked salt and the remaining 60ml of oil to get a bright green paste. Scrape into the bowl of potatoes, with the remaining two tablespoons of lime juice. Gently stir through the radishes (including the liquid) and the picked Thai basil leaves.Finish with the chilli and almonds, and serve.On paper it may not sound as if it would work, but the combination of figs, Chinese rice wine and ricotta is marvellous. This dish is a fine balance of sweet and savoury, so it’s important your figs are ripe and sweet. If they aren’t, increase the amount of maple syrup a little.The infused oil and cooked figs need time to marinate, so make them a day ahead if you like. The figs can be cooked up to three days before and kept in the fridge (just bring back to room temperature before you assemble the salad). You can even leave them in the fridge for up to three weeks to ferment (or at least become a little funky) they make a great addition to a cheese board.Serves 4 as a starter8 ripe purple figs, halved (320g) 1 tbsp soy sauce 2½ tbsp maple syrup 2 tbsp Shaoxing rice wine (or pale dry sherry) 2½ tsp Chinkiang vinegar (or half the amount of balsamic vinegar) 60ml olive oil 2 red chillies, finely sliced into rounds (20g) 1 lemon: finely shave the skin to get 5 strips 60g rocket 140g ricottaHeat the oven to its highest grill setting. Toss the figs with the soy sauce and one and a half tablespoons of maple syrup, then arrange, cut side up and spaced apart, on a medium, parchment-lined baking tray. Make sure there is no overhanging parchment that could burn under the grill. Roast for 12 minutes on the top shelf of the oven, until they are soft and caramelised, but still holding their shape. Return figs and cooking juices to the bowl, with the rice wine, vinegar and remaining tablespoon of maple syrup. Gently mix, then set aside for at least one hour (or overnight) for the flavours to come together.Meanwhile, heat the oil in a small pan on a medium heat and, once hot, fry the chillies for three minutes, stirring to separate the slices. Add the lemon strips and fry for 30 seconds until fragrant, then immediately pour into a heatproof bowl and set aside to infuse for at least 30 minutes (or overnight).Arrange the rocket on a platter and top with the figs and dressing. Dot with spoonfuls of the ricotta, finish with the infused oil, chillies and lemon strips, and serve.• Extracted from Ottolenghi Flavour, by Yotam Ottolenghi and Ixta Belfrage, published by Ebury on 3 September at £27.

Argentina led Belgium 1-0 in their 2014 World Cup quarter‑final. They were in control, playing well. The forward line, as usual, felt a mismatch of extremely talented but not particularly complementary players, but with a solid and well-balanced midfield, it didn’t really seem to matter. Then Ángel Di María pulled his hamstring.Di María had a vital role in Alejandro Sabella’s side. Javier Mascherano mopped up in front of the back four. Lucas Biglia scuttled around alongside him. And to the left of the three Di María shuttled to the forward line, the vital link between two otherwise disparate units. His role wasn’t glamorous. He was easily overlooked. But once he was gone, his importance became obvious. Enzo Pérez, a far more defensive presence, replaced him. Argentina won the game and went on to reach the final, but in the five hours of football they played at that World Cup after Di María’s injury, they didn’t score another goal.In football’s modern world of glitz and glamour, when it feels as though the super-clubs prefer to sign celebrities rather than submit to the rigours of following a coherent tactical plan, there is an irony in Di María finally beginning to be appreciated at the club that, for so long, was the market leader in placing star quality over structure – and the reverse of that is also true: Di María’s increasing prominence is evidence of PSG’s growing maturity. If they are to win the Champions League, it will almost certainly require Di María to keep Joshua Kimmich quiet and to exploit Bayern Munich’s aggressively high line.For years, it seems, Di María has been underappreciated. Perhaps it’s because he doesn’t look much like a footballer (although he does, from certain angles, bear a striking resemblance to Franz Kafka). He does not have the eye-catching footwork or goals return of many of his teammates. But he does have a remarkable capacity to link one line of a team to another, starting either as a forward or in midfield, and functioning as a bridge from one to the other.In Tuesday’s 3-0 semi-final victory over RB Leipzig, he set up two goals with impeccable crosses and scored the other. But more than that was what he ensured didn’t happen. Against Atalanta, when he had been suspended, a gulf had opened between the front three and the other seven outfielders. Against RB Leipzig, PSG pressed more and the team was far more compact.But this wasn’t even the first Champions League semi-final Di María has dominated. In the second leg in 2014, it was, as much as anything else, his countering ability, his intuition of when to carry the ball and when to offload it, that allowed Real Madrid to unpick Bayern as they won 4-0 at the Allianz.He was the Uefa man of the match in the victory over Atlético in the final as well. Di María had made decisive contributions to the last two games as Madrid clinched la décima, and yet that summer he left. The club has always claimed it was because of the excessive demands of his agent – but that agent is Jorge Mendes, which made Di María’s continued presence at Madrid problematic after the departure the previous summer of José Mourinho, who had lobbied hard for his signing in 2010. Before the final, Madrid asked him not to risk his hamstring as they wanted to sell him to make way for the more obviously marketable James Rodríguez, who bears no resemblance to any gloomy Bohemian modernist.So, having few options, Di María ended up at Manchester United, where he had never really wanted to go. The tendency is to remember Di María’s loss of form and the acrimony that surrounded his departure. But he started the season well and, in 20 league starts, registered three goals and a remarkable 10 assists. The downturn was perhaps in part caused by his frustration at the restrictions placed on him by Louis van Gaal, followed by a break-in at his home that left him fearing for the safety of his family. Di María is naturally introspective and that, combined with struggles with the language, contributed to a general loss of confidence and morale.With Argentina, the situation is more complicated. Di María has won more than 100 caps, some achievement given the wealth of attacking options available to them, but he has undoubtedly been tainted by the years of failure, and the strangely stodgy football a concatenation of brilliant attacking talent habitually produces. There’s no obvious reason that the front three of Lionel Messi, Sergio Agüero and Di María that won Olympic gold in 2008 shouldn’t have brought similar success in the senior game, but it never quite has.While manager after manager has seen Di María and his versatility as part of the solution, there’s a constituency of fans and journalists who have begun to wonder if he’s actually part of the problem. And perhaps he is, but it’s also the case that his unflashy style makes it harder instantly to recall a goal or a run or a pass that could be entered as evidence for the defence.And so to France, where PSG’s resources so dwarf everybody else’s that statistics become so distorted as to be meaningless. Di María’s goals return has shot up from one every seven games in the rest of his career to one in every three – but so it should. But far more significant is his less conspicuous contribution.Di María is one of the very few to have played with Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo and Neymar. He has thrived with each of them. He is unselfish, makes covering runs, creates space and compensates for their sporadic approach to pressing. It is easy to see why coaches, other than Van Gaal, appreciate an industrious player who naturally balances a side. Then, every now and again, he has a game like he did against Leipzig, and offers a reminder that he’s also an exceptional talent in his own right. To borrow from John Milton, they also serve, who only run about lots in tactically intelligent and selfless patterns."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6ab834b02ffd8f95f3bd2158dadb9e40c36e0a68/0_1124_4480_2688/master/4480.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ae9478cb13d3208fdb751668549bbc5a","title":"giles andreae every creative thing ive done was rejected before it was accepted ","story":"The writer and illustrator, 54, talks about cruel teasing of redheads, defeating cancer, being remembered as a radiator and his slightly superior identical twinI had a very happy childhood. I’m one of four brothers and have an identical twin, so I was born with a readymade best friend. But he was ever so slightly better at everything than me. If we played football, he’d win 10-9. He was always one grade higher than me at school. I suppose it made me want to try a bit harder.I was never a manly, macho lad. I was a skinny ginger who liked poetry. I never wanted to conform to laddishness, rugby playing, that whole side of masculinity. You need to find your own thing, and do it with as much heart and joy as you can.I was teased for being ginger my entire life, so I’m not bothered about going grey. Teasing someone for having red hair is possibly the only prejudice that’s still permissible. With men, what people are really saying is: you’re not attractive. That’s not very nice.The first creative thing I ever did was Purple Ronnie. It began as a stage act at university. It’s quite bold to go on stage with some very weird poems when you’ve got no idea what’s going to happen, but because I had a doting mother, I think I grew up with a certain level of self-confidence.Every creative thing I’ve ever done has been rejected before it’s been accepted. Purple Ronnie was rejected by about 20 publishers. Every book I’ve written has been rejected, too. If you’re trying to do new things, particularly creatively, rejection is a standard part of the process.Creativity, freedom, love, experimentation: these are all the things that I value, and tend to write about.I’m an optimist. I think if you don’t fully believe in the potential of what you’re doing, why on earth would you do it? If I was a pessimist I’d never do anything. It would be terribly draining. I read once that people can be considered either radiators or drains. I’d like to be remembered as a radiator.The worst thing anyone has ever said to me is: you’ve got cancer. It’s happened three times. The first two times it was actually the same cancer: Hodgkin’s disease, when I was 22. And the words were accompanied by, ‘and you’ll probably never be able to have children.’ I had to have very intensive chemotherapy, but I did store sperm – and that was used to make our four children. It’s a rather miraculous story.Vulnerability is a huge asset, both personally and creatively. And I’ve certainly been a lot more vulnerable than some people have. I’m also an inveterate crier. But I cry more out of happiness and pride than sadness.I get depressed by social situations where you have boring, lifeless, meaningless conversations. I revel in human spontaneity and contact and joy. Life’s too short to talk shit!I don’t think I’ve ever been happier than I am right now. I’ve nearly died loads of times, I’ve had clinical depression twice. But I’ve managed to have a family. I’ve managed to make a success of my career. I live somewhere I love.

This was well after the late film director Pier Paolo Pasolini, whose work includes The Gospel According to St Matthew, made it the setting for some of his seminal pieces –but long before the trendy restaurants moved in and the New York Times coined it “an enclave of cool”.Roberta, 54, and Paolo, 57, chose to invest in a location that would provide them with creative headspace. Three decades later, it has more than paid its dues, not least during the months of Covid-19 lockdown.“We feel like it is an island in the city and we have felt so lucky to be here,” says Paolo. “It really is so special and attracts a lot of people – designers, artists and people in fashion – looking for peaceful tranquillity. It isn’t as expensive as other areas around either. We were probably among the first people who moved here and we found it perfect for our lifestyle.”Looking around the home the couple share with their teenage son Rocco, it’s easy to see why. Spacious and airy, the gallery-like space they designed and renovated with architect Adriano Pingaro 12 years ago affords them ample yet intimate room. The exterior is, says Paolo, typical of the kind of single-storey houses that you find locally. The interior, on the other hand, mirrors the aesthetic of their jewellery brand, which is celebrated for mingling old-world craft with modernist charm.A mixture of high-end furniture – including a set of Vittorio Nobili’s sought-after 1955 Medea chairs and Gio Ponti’s more prevalent 646 Leggera chair – sits alongside more quirky personal items, such as treasured vintage glass ceiling lamps and rustic wooden tables. Books that have been carefully collected from outdoor flea markets in downtown Rome abound. The look, says Paolo, is “more Italian baroque” than bohemian.Concrete floors and walls are offset by sumptuous velvets, slinky satins, lightweight linens and an extensive art collection. A piece by photographer Nan Goldin – a 40th-birthday gift to Roberta from Paolo – hangs above the bath, while a cosy glow emits from the bedside lamps, which the pair designed for the Iosselliani Design branch of their brand for GiustiniStagetti – an international contemporary design gallery in Rome.It is, however, the exterior element of this interior that really brings their home to life. Outside space was non-negotiable for the couple, and their home is sandwiched between two gardens. The polished concrete walls and floors that are found throughout the house extend into the outside area, which features a cuboid bath of the same material. Floor-to-ceiling glass doors, meanwhile, form invisible barriers between the two terrains.“In a big city like Rome or Paris or London, it’s not easy to find outside space, but it’s so important for your lifestyle,” explains Paolo, who notes that the weather tends to be good year-round in Rome, so they get to enjoy it all the time.“We love the connection between the inside and the outside,” he continues, “and that’s why we specifically surrounded ourselves by glass – so that the outside and inside feel like the same place.”The stainless-steel kitchen and stripped-back bathroom also nod to the exterior spaces, which helps to further dissolve the boundaries between exterior and interior. “One side is tropical with bamboo and banana trees, because we had a strong connection with tropical places after travelling, and the other is classic Mediterranean with more colour,” says Paolo, admitting that both the thriving gardens are the result of Roberta’s hard work.A stone’s throw away from their home in Pigneto is the couple’s atelier, where they design their collections and have a base for their staff, in addition to their flagship in central Rome. They bought the three-storey structure five years ago and worked 24 hours a day to make it the kind of inspiring place in which they could run their company.Much like their home, the atelier is also open-plan. The double-height space with its navy-blue curtains and a TechnoD70 sofa by Osvaldo Borsani contrasts with neutral upholstery courtesy of Marco Zanuso’s Lady armchair. Jaunty abstraction is introduced by a carpet from Allegra Hicks, while huge fern clippings from Roberta’s garden once again bring the outside in.Art continues on the staircase with portraits and graphic lettering by the contemporary artists Luca Donnini, Pietro Bologna and Tommaso Modugno. It’s an extension of their home a mixture of materials and media that fuels the couple’s day-to-day work and wider existence in the city.“We’re partners in business and life,” says Paolo, before going on to reveal their plan to exercise the Italian tradition-cum-rite of decamping to the seaside, coronavirus restrictions permitting. Which does beg the question: who would want to leave a place like this?

What keeps me coming back is hopeMy daughter is here. Curled up in a hedgehog ball, but softer than anything in the universe. She is born with a quiff of thick black hair and an expression that says she’s been here before. A knowing, testing look. She is early, and small. I begin assessing my baby as if she’s one of my intensive-care patients. I check her reflexes, pupil reaction, respiratory rate and capillary refill time. Mary, the maternity support worker, watches me and laughs. “Nurses and doctors – always the worst patients.”I try not to think of all the babies, children and adults I’ve cared for who were seriously ill, but I can’t stop. I realise that when my daughter hurts, I will hurt more. And she is not hurting. She is fine. But something in me shifts. I think of all the faces of the mothers and fathers and aunts and uncles and grandparents of my patients through all my years of paediatric nursing. I try to imagine their primal pain. How could I not have appreciated the extent of it? In the most desperate of unimaginable horrors, in the face of disability, or serious illness, or pain, or loss, how do patients’ families stand upright? How do they find the courage to care?I pull my daughter closer and kiss her. She smells of honeysuckle and salt, and Plasticine when the packet is first opened, and warm bread, and blood. She is perfect. How could I imagine a love like this?“Crash call for the neonatal, adult and obstetric teams. I repeat: crash call for the neonatal, adult and obstetric teams. Accident and Emergency. Ground floor, Cavell Wing.”There’s only one explanation for why you would need three crash teams at once: a heavily pregnant woman is in trouble. The adult team is to resuscitate her the obstetrics team is to get the baby out (within five minutes, if either of them is to have any chance of survival) and the neonatal team is to try to resuscitate the newborn. Like all the other resuscitation nurses, I am on all the crash teams – adult, paediatric, neonatal, obstetric and trauma – but this crash call will also bring specialist doctors: an obstetrician, a neonatologist, an anaesthetist.Suzanne is wearing a necklace that reads Mama-To-Be. A leopard-print headscarf is holding her ombre hair back from her face. The rest of her is blood and gore and flesh and insides.There are so many people that it’s hard to know where to start, but the person in charge is a nurse with a military background: Amanda. She is one of the best nurses I have ever worked with, a reservist who has worked in field hospitals in Iraq and Afghanistan. She is always calm, efficient and friendly. “Just because it’s an emergency doesn’t mean you can’t find out the names of the team, and be nice. In fact, it’s even more important in an emergency.”Amanda glances over, so that she knows I’m here whenever she needs. I start tidying up, working on the periphery.I do not see how Suzanne or her baby can survive. I focus on the drops of sweat on Amanda’s face, her eyes wildly searching for control, a plan – a way to save this woman and her baby. Or at least one of them. I try to imagine the things she has seen and experienced in her military role. I can’t think of anyone better to lead such a horrific emergency. “She needs to be in theatre as soon as we have this baby out. Like yesterday!” A doctor is on the phone, asking for flying-squad bloods. I watch the defibrillator. Amanda asks a member of the team to put the pads on Suzanne’s chest in advance of a surely imminent cardiac arrest. The obstetrician pulls the baby from her, lifts it out, wipes off the goo vigorously and places it on the Resuscitaire, for another doctor waiting there with a miniature bag-valve-mask and a stethoscope, straight to the baby’s chest. The obstetrician leaves Suzanne split open: it’s impossible to see where the blood is coming from. Large gauze squares do nothing to mop up anything. Anyone can see it’s a devastating amount to lose.There are too many people around Suzanne’s trolley. Despite the lack of room, everyone moves at speed without bumping into one another, each person perfectly choreographed by Amanda.Suzanne’s husband, Simon, is standing outside the room. I go out and stand next to him. His bottom lip is bleeding a little, where he’s bitten it. I tell him I’ll wait with him while they are helping her. But he doesn’t hear me, not really.“She’s ordered a Bugaboo pushchair and is spending her pregnancy ordering everything possible from the Boden catalogue,” he says. “I never imagined we’d end up as this couple.” He laughs a too-thin laugh. “We met in a squat.” He makes a loud noise as he exhales, as if he has no control of his breath.His face is creased with pain. “After 10 failed IVF attempts and two miscarriages, we finally felt as if this one would stick around.” He looks at me, unblinking. “She’ll lose the baby, won’t she? We’ll lose the baby. It’s too early. She was on the phone to me from the car. She was hands-free but still, she’d have been distracted.” He sobs. Covers his mouth with his hand.I don’t say anything. I don’t know yet what he’s been told, but it’s clear that I’m not the right person, and this is not the right time to give significant bad news. I’m terrified that if I open my mouth, the truth will fall out. The terrible truth is that they will probably both die. Not all babies live. Not all mothers live.We stand in silence for a while, before finally I overcome the urge to cry or say nothing at all. “Is there anyone I can call for you?”He shakes his head. Nods at the door. “She’s my everyone.”I nod. “I’ll pop back in and see how things are going.”As I go through the door again, I have to swallow down sick. I look at the scene in front of me. The staff are covered in blood, as is the floor.I focus on the baby on the Resuscitaire, grey and small, and stretched out rather than curled over, as is normal. But the neonatologist looks up at the team: he gives us the thumbs up. This baby lives. I exhale.I rush out to tell Simon.“They are working on Suzanne and she’s still critical. Everyone is doing all they can.” I pause. I don’t want him to underestimate how sick she is. But I can see that he needs something to hold on to. “Your baby is alive.”He looks at me in a kind of trance. “I’m a dad?” he asks.He is clearly so full of love. He doesn’t ask whether the baby is a boy or a girl, and nor do I. When things go this wrong, nobody gives a shit.Suzanne is somehow stable. She is placed in the high-dependency ward and her baby is on special care.I bump into Simon in the corridor two days later, rushing between the two. He is carrying a soft toy hippo. He looks like the happiest man in the world.“Suzanne slept with the hippo against her skin. The midwife said our daughter can smell her, and it’s the closest Suzanne will get to skin-to-skin for now.”“Daughter?” I am smiling.He’s crying. Happy tears. “I’m a wreck,” he says. “She’s so beautiful. Like her mum.” He holds the hippo as if it’s his baby. “I’ve turned into one of those baby bores who gets excited every time she moves.” He laughs. Then he bursts into huge, fat tears, a mixture of pain, trauma and relief. He tells me about Suzanne: how she didn’t wake up for a long time, and it was the scariest moment of his life.“We’re thinking of calling her Amanda, after the doctor who saved her mum’s life.”The adoption process is hard, as it must be. In the early stages, we were asked to list the things that led us to adopt. Miscarriage, I write. Hyperemesis gravidarum, extreme morning sickness. Advised by GP not to get pregnant again. Wanting three-year-old daughter to have a sibling as close to her as my brother is to me. Hoping to do some good? The social worker tells us that children who need to be adopted have extra special needs and there are many uncertainties, so many unknowns. But nursing has allowed me to understand that all parenting is full of uncertainties and unknowns. I have seen close up the most extreme suffering and the most extreme love.The day I bring my son home, it is my birthday. When my social worker asked if I’d like to change days, I laughed out loud. I am desperate to hold him. One night I dream about an umbilical cord that stretches the length of the country and awake with pains in my abdomen.But we are warned about a honeymoon period and things do get very hard, very quickly. He begins to get frightened. He almost seems to see things that aren’t there and hear loud noises in his head. After the initial few days, my son spends the first six months clinging to me, his fingers digging into my flesh so hard that he once draws blood.My mum visits. “What if I’m wrong for him?” I whisper, looking at my son.“Do you love him?” she asks.“So much,” I say. I lean my head on her shoulder. “I can’t even describe it.”She kisses the top of my head as if I am a child. “Then it will all fall into place. I promise.”The following week I take my daughter to her swimming lesson and the noise of the leisure centre freaks my son out so much that he bites me, hard. I yelp. A woman I recognise from the local cafe shouts across the swimming pool viewing area: “Is that the adopted one?” My son turns and listens, and I absolutely know in my bones that he understands what she has said. His face fills with tears. He does not belong. My son and I look at each other. Something shifts. “Is that the adopted one?” she shouts over again. “I see you are struggling.”And I look at my son, this virtual stranger. And he looks at me, this virtual stranger. I stand up and hold him to my body. I walk to the exit, past her, and she touches him. I feel him flinch. I flinch.I hold him closer still, with my arm around his head, away from her. And I feel his fear through my skin. I lift my head high and stare at her.“Oh, fuck off, Janet,” I say. And we go. And he relaxes. For the first time he puts his head down gently on my shoulder. He rests it so gently I can barely breathe. I kiss his head. And he lets me. In that single moment, whatever happens, he somehow knows he is OK. We both are. I am reminded so clearly of the day my daughter was born and the enormity of love that I felt. How could I feel a love like that again? Yet here it is. We are so lucky.“Michael is a 23-weeker in bed six, bay two. His dad’s in prison and his mum is in a facility needing round-the-clock care following a traumatic brain injury. Michael has had a grade-four intraventricular haemorrhage overnight and has been unstable on dopamine, and his gases are impressive. We need to put him back on the oscillator this morning. We’ve been trying to organise for his dad, Danny, to get day-release to visit.” She pauses. “He kicked the pregnant mum in the stomach, then threw her down the stairs. She landed on concrete.”Like the other nurses and student nurses sitting in the staffroom for handover, I shake my head a fraction, but carry on scribbling down the vital information. The nurse in charge pauses a beat, then carries on. She’s seen it all before. “Christie, can you look after him, please? If they agree to the visit, the dad will be accompanied by a prison officer, so we’ll need to make some room around the bed space and be conscious of the other parents.”I nod, but my knees shake. The oscillator machine, which delivers ventilation to the sickest of all babies, is a scary thing, as is caring for a premature baby with a severe bleed in his brain. But it is not those things that worry me.Kicked in the stomach and thrown down the stairs.What kind of monster does that?I pray to any god I can think of that they won’t let the man out to see his son and that I can simply concentrate on caring for Michael. He is hooked up to every machine imaginable – all big, chugging technology with him in the middle: like a full stop in the centre of a chemistry textbook. He has all the trappings of prematurity: lungs that do not yet produce enough surfactant, a gut that does not yet absorb food properly, poor reflexes, a lack of temperature control. He has suffered the worst kind of bleed to his brain. He also has retinopathy of prematurity, the eye condition that caused Stevie Wonder’s blindness. But these conditions don’t paint the picture of him. When I first meet Michael, I notice the downy hair that I recognise from caring for teenagers suffering from anorexia. His skin is almost entirely see-through, and his entire foot is the size of my thumbnail. He has a permanent frown, which makes him look like a grumpy old man, and he smells of yoghurt.“He’s the size of half a bag of sugar, but he is oh-so-mighty and has dodged death so many times that we call him ‘the mouse with nine lives’.” One of the nurses, Grainne, is giving a handover at the bedside. She has written Mighty Mouse on his whiteboard. “We shouldn’t have favourites,” she says, as if she’s talking about her own children, “but he’s mine.”She tells me his history in his short three days of life. Born addicted to crack cocaine and heroin, even in his tiny state he shows signs of foetal alcohol syndrome: characteristic facial features and a small head circumference known as microcephaly. Some children are born with the odds stacked so high against them, it’s impossible to comprehend any meaningful recovery, yet nursing has taught me that it is always a possibility. There is always hope.Michael’s “Mighty Mouse” nickname hints that he might have the will to survive. “I’ve been singing to him all night,” Grainne says. “I think my voice made him frown.” She laughs. But it’s these things that nurses do, which supposedly make no sense, that make the most sense to me.Danny is handcuffed to a prison officer and is next to Michael’s incubator when I return from breakfast at 4pm, my first break of the day. Being non-judgmental towards abusers is difficult and I’ve learned to hate and judge while keeping a poker face. I smile at him and explain the tubes and wires. “Michael’s had a very rough few days.” I tell Danny about the cardiac arrests, the bleed in his brain, the fight in him.Danny laughs at the Mighty Mouse written on the side of Michael’s chart, but he rubs it off and writes Mike Tyson instead. “Little fighter, like me,” he says.“I was born early, too.” Danny is stroking Michael’s head in the softest way possible. “A small bag of sugar.” He looks up at me. “Six foot two now.” “It’s a strange phenomenon that ex-premmies often end up so tall,” I say. We both look at Michael. He is extremely unlikely to survive.I encourage Danny to touch Michael, to talk to him and sing to him. He cracks up laughing at the suggestion of singing, but puts his hand gently underneath Michael’s miniature body and lifts him slightly as I pull the corner of his special sheet to make sure there are no creases. There is a moment, between the two of them. Michael is curled into the palm of his dad’s hand. Danny’s eyes change. It’s one of those extreme moments of love that shock us out of who we are and remind us of who we could be.I take a photo with one of the instant cameras that are always kept in the neonatal intensive care unit, for when a picture urgently needs to be taken. Usually when a baby is close to dying, I take two photos. I take one of Danny’s face, and then a closeup of Michael, curled up in Danny’s hand.It’s a short visit and when it’s time to go, I give Danny the photos. He looks at the one of Michael and he is crying. “I’ll treasure this, nurse.”And I see that he will. It does not allow me to feel pity for him, but he is no longer a monster to me. Just a weak man.“Wait,” I tell him. I disappear and come back with the camera. “Can you hold him carefully again.” Danny picks Michael up and I get the photo – almost exactly the same as the first one. Michael’s heart rate, which was much too high, falls at the touch of Danny’s hand. His father leans towards him and sings, off-key, a few lines of Danny Boy.I wonder if a man ever sang that song to Danny. If that’s how he got his name. And what kind of man he was.Like teachers, nurses can’t influence who a person becomes as much as their parents can. We cannot change the cards they are dealt. Even so, after Danny leaves, I wipe the words Mike Tyson from Michael’s whiteboard. I stick the extra photo to the top of his incubator and write at the top: Important. Please Keep, along with the date and Danny’s name. I write on the whiteboard:Michael, son of Danny and Hannah.Spring 2020. I am walking across Westminster bridge. Behind me, the Houses of Parliament are empty. In front of me, the hospital is full of people seriously ill and dying from Covid-19. The bridge is empty of cars and people, even rough sleepers. I wonder where they have gone.I walk slowly at first. I am so worried for my mum, on her own. And for my nan, shielding and in her 90s. I stop for a moment and text my children. They have grown up overnight. I am a single parent and my 15-year-old daughter, instead of going out to parties and falling in love for the first time, is offering to stay on top of her home schooling and keeping an eye on her younger brother, so I can work long days in nursing. She is planning to cook, so there is a meal waiting when I get home. I tell her she doesn’t need to do that because her adult sister – her dad’s eldest – has offered to stay to help, but she is already writing a menu. Pesto pasta features heavily.“I feel bad about not focusing on you. We ought to be together during this time,” I say at home.“Will you help people?” my daughter asks. I nod and tell them I’m rusty but that, with training and support, I’ll help the nurses, and the patients and their families. I’m planning to help for the first peak, though I have no idea how long that will last. “Do it,” she says.I stand back and look at her grinning, remembering her newly born, curled up in a hedgehog ball. How astonishing she turned out to be. I may not be feeling brave, but my children are. It is always from them that I find the courage to care. My son nods and puts on his determined expression. “You must.”Back on the bridge, I am almost running now. I think of the nurses I have worked with, these expert and compassionate people, and what they have taught me. I get to stand next to them, for a while at least. This pull of my feet and my heart and my head is older and deeper than I can describe in language. Perhaps, for me at least, this is a calling.I slow down at the entrance to the hospital and walk in, catching my breath. My colleague, Sandra, is waiting for me, wearing scrubs and carrying a spare pair for me. We haven’t seen each other for a few years, but there is no time for small talk. She hands the scrubs over and nods. “Welcome home.”• Some names and details have been changed.

And it couldn’t come at a better timeThe first of the UK’s “child trust fund babies” turn 18 next month, triggering the start of a multibillion-pound payout to an estimated 5.5 million-plus young people.Starting from September the windfalls will run all the way through until January 2029, with about 55,000 teenagers each month becoming entitled to a pot of cash with their name on it.Launched back in 2005, child trust funds – or “baby bonds” – were scrapped a decade ago, but they have been quietly ticking away in the background ever since, and they are finally coming of age.From 1 September the oldest children will turn 18 and be able to access their money. The very last people to get payouts are currently only aged nine and a half, so they have a long wait.It’s a huge programme: more than 6.3m CTF accounts were opened. Since 2015, anyone with money in a CTF has been able to transfer it to a Junior Isa, so that number will have come down a little bit. Nevertheless, there is estimated to be about £9bn locked up in CTFs.So how much might people get? For a small minority of youngsters who received the lowest possible government contribution and then had nothing added, they might be looking at less than £100. At the other end, there are accounts worth tens of thousands.For many, though, it is likely to be several hundred, or perhaps, a couple of thousand.Coronavirus has caused havoc with millions of people’s finances, so for many of those whose funds mature in the coming months, this windfall couldn’t have come at a better time – money to put towards university, to pay for driving lessons or fund a gap year – or simply splurge on something frivolous. Others may want to invest the cash.But many youngsters will be unaware that there is a CTF account in their name. After all, they were opened a long time ago and some parents will have simply forgotten about it and possibly moved house. Some estimate that these “lost” accounts could make up a third of the total.Child trust funds were long-term tax-free savings accounts for children. The then chancellor, Gordon Brown, launched them in 2005, backdating the first to youngsters born in 2002. Every child born between 1 September 2002 and 2 January 2011 was awarded a cash “endowment”. For most, the payment was £250, with £500 to those from the poorest families.A few hundred thousand kids (those whose seventh birthday fell between 1 September 2009 and 31 July 2010) also received a top-up payment from the government – again either £250 or £500.In 2010 it was announced that CTFs would be scrapped to save money. The government cash handouts were stopped or reduced after 31 July 2010, and no child born after 2 January 2011 was entitled to one. They had to make do with a Junior Isa, which didn’t offer a government incentive.But, crucially, the trust funds already in existence were allowed to continue. And family and friends were able to carry on topping up, which many did.With a CTF, the money belongs to the child, though they can only take it out when they are 18 – at which point they can spend it on whatever they want, or reinvest it.The approximately £9bn locked up in CTFs is made up of around £3.3bn that the government coughed up, £2.5bn in contributions added by family and friends, and £3bn or so of investment growth, says Gavin Oldham, founder of charity The Share Foundation.This will vary hugely. It all depends on how much cash the government contributed – this ranged from just £50 all the way up to £1,000, depending on date of birth and family income – plus how much (if any) was added by family and friends, and what type of fund the money went into.Let’s take someone who got two payments of £250, one at birth and another on their seventh birthday. This money was invested in the FTSE 100 index, but no further contributions were made. They would have a pot worth about £1,198 on 14 August this year, says Laura Suter, personal finance analyst at investment platform AJ Bell.If parents had also paid money in over the years, some soon-to-be-18-year-olds could be sitting on a very decent pot. Someone who got the two £250 government contributions but whose parents have added £100 a month since birth and invested it in the FTSE 100, would have a windfall of £33,564 heading their way.But there have been big variations in fund performance. Investment Life \u0026amp Pensions Moneyfacts and research firm Lipper looked at how much some of the stakeholder funds are now worth, based on a single £250 investment in April 2005. They found that one of the best performers has been Santander’s, which has turned £250 into £579 (the value on 14 August).They say other decent performers include F\u0026ampC Investments (now rebranded BMO) and The Share Centre, whose stakeholder CTFs have grown to £557 and £545 respectively.By contrast, HSBC’s stakeholder CTF managed only £403.OneFamily, which describes itself as the UK’s largest CTF provider – it looks after one in four accounts – said earlier this month that its average account value was £2,079.Nationwide building society was a big player in the market, and each month will see about 4,500 of its cash CTF accounts reach maturity. It says the average balance of those due to mature in the next six months is £2,311. However, it adds: “This increases to an average of £5,263 for those that have been topping up, rather than just investing the initial voucher.”If a child’s parents or  failed to open a CTF account within a year of having received the payment voucher, HM Revenue \u0026amp Customs opened a stakeholder CTF on their behalf. More than 1.8m “Revenue-allocated” accounts ended up being opened. On top of that, there are thought to be several hundred thousand CTFs classed as “addressee gone away”.All this means that for many youngsters there will be a pot of cash out there that they are unaware of.But the good news is that if you are perhaps 16 or 17, and your parents or carer don’t know which provider your CTF is with, help is at hand.The Share Foundation has been working with the government to help young people find their accounts, and runs a free-to-use search service.

Workplaces, childcare facilities and businesses, including restaurants and pubs, will remain open, however, leading to questions about how the new restrictions will be policed.Other areas in the north-west including six parts of Greater Manchester are on the government’s “watch list” of places where the number of coronavirus cases is a cause for concern.The mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, told Sky News the government’s test-and-trace system was failing and this was the reason for the recent rise in cases.Citing a report that shows the test-and-trace system is reaching only half of the people who have been in contact with somebody who has been infected with coronavirus in the 20 most-affected areas of the country, he said: “The question you have to ask is: Why is it so low in the places where we need it to be highest?”Burnham added that it was “not fair for the government to threaten these places with a lockdown, when they aren’t doing some of the basic things that could be done to help those communities manage the spread of this virus”.On Saturday, Greater Manchester police tweeted: “Please do not call 101 or 999 for clarification on ovid-19 regulations.”The police force also issued several social media posts about parties and gatherings that officers had to break up on Friday evening.These include a wedding party with more than 30 people at a private address in Rochdale, a house party in Oldham attended by more than 30 teenagers, a gathering of more than 50 people in Middleton and a children’s birthday party in a garden in Swinton which was attended by people from three different families.Officers also attended a property in Blackley where 12 people gathered in a private garden were dispersed and issued a fixed penalty notice. The group told officers they were unsure of current restrictions in the north-west as they were not local to Greater Manchester, according to the tweet.The Labour leader of Pendle council, Mohammed Iqbal, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme his borough had in effect been split into two by the new restrictions, which had caused confusion.He said: “The government has announced these tightening restrictions for local people in my area, yet they have not issued any detailed guidance as to how it will operate, who will police it. So local people are actually more confused than they were on Thursday evening.”He said the restrictions, which the council argued against, had been imposed to “punish people who have been testing flat out”.Meanwhile, the Oldham council leader, Sean Fielding, said the local authority had more enforcement capacity to take action against people breaking the rules. He told BBC Breakfast that at least one pub had been closed in the past 24 hours.He said: “Part of our discussions with government which helped us to avert the kind of economic lockdown of the kind in Leicester was a pledge around increasing the capacity in our enforcement teams so that we could take action where we had reports of businesses or premises or households not following the rules.“So when we receive those reports we now have additional capacity around enforcement and compliance to take action, whether it’s fines, whether it’s closure orders or whatever. We have closed at least one pub in the last 24 hours.”He added that the local authority was enlisting the help of celebrities to get the new coronavirus restriction messages across. Fielding said it had recruited Azhar Ali, the Pakistan cricket captain, and the actor James Buckley, who played Jay in the TV series The Inbetweeners.Cases in Oldham reached 103.1 per 100,000 people during the week ending 13 August, with Blackburn and Pendle reaching 95.3 and 75.5 cases per 100,000 people respectively."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/41c554fd0b4548dd20532bbad78da09e07a4227c/0_239_4879_2928/master/4879.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=62c2e5c5b75cead5d73202e51400d341","title":"leicester bath premiership rugby union match report","story":"At some point the callow Tiger cubs chosen to represent Leicester on Saturday will look back and reflect on the value of hard-earned experience. Sadly, however, this match was barely a contest with a significantly stronger Bath side helping themselves to a bonus-point victory which hoists them back to fifth in the Premiership table. For the first time in the 107-year history of this fixture, Bath have now won three games in a row at their rivals’ supposed citadel.These are curious times, clearly, but even with such a crowded fixture schedule to negotiate this was a strange moment for Steve Borthwick to choose to rest the majority of his first-choice troops.While the decision was clearly made with the forthcoming midweek fixture against London Irish uppermost in mind, large chunks of this one-sided affair resembled men against boys in front of the England coach Eddie Jones and his assistants.If the plan was to check out a few immediate international candidates under intense match-day conditions, Jones will not have learned a huge amount. Maybe it was just as well there were no paying spectators present. Even a Leicester team with an average age of under 24 is not supposed to ship six tries at home and it was almost possible to hear the distant grumbling of the absent Tigers fans drifting in on the blustery east Midlands breeze.With any threat of relegation lifted courtesy of Saracens’ demotion, however, Borthwick is clearly seeking to use the next few weeks to identify the likeliest lads among Leicester’s next generation. The socially-distanced press box was certainly united in hoping for some magic from the young wing Harry Potter on his club debut but the newcomer - formerly of Sydney University rather than Gryffindor – had few chances to perform much wizardry here.Nor did many others in green, red and white stripes, other than defensively. If the first quarter was relatively respectable, with Bath initially sluggish and Johnny McPhillips kicking two penalties, the rest was mostly predictable. When it came to close-quarters power near the line, in particular, the hosts were brutally exposed from an early stage, with Bath’s entire front row all helping themselves to first-half tries.There was also an eye-catching score for Ruaridh McConnochie who, as he had promised in the build-up, was clearly determined to show the England coaching contingent he has not lost the X-factor which earned him World Cup squad selection in Japan last year. The wing left three would-be tacklers sprawled on the turf behind him on his way to the line, and would be queuing up to play rugby every day of the week if this much space and possession were always guaranteed.The only surprise was that the half-time margin of 26-6 did not widen significantly in the second 40 minutes. Before kick-off only Worcester and Leicester had scored fewer Premiership tries this season than Bath but this really was a heaven-sent chance for the attack-minded visiting backs to stretch their legs and show their class.The rich promise of Cameron Redpath is already widely known but Bath fans will also be extremely keen to see how Tom de Glanville, son of the former England captain Phil, settles into a blue, black and white shirt. De Glanville came off the bench for the second half as a replacement for the sharp-looking Anthony Watson at full-back and has the precious gifts of pace and excellent spatial awareness. We should expect to hear plenty more about him in the coming months.It was a slightly bulkier reserve, however, who made the swiftest impression after the interval. Beno Obano is an increasing handful against all comers and, within two minutes of appearing, there was no stopping the powerful loose-head from yet another close-range drive. Josh Matevesi, only just on to the field in place of Rhys Priestland, then sold a massive dummy in midfield before unselfishly putting De Glanville over and the rest, as far as Leicester were concerned, was a damage limitation exercise.They were helped by a flurry of Bath replacements, also designed to preserve some key men for more intense battles ahead, and Taulupe Faletau’s trip to the sin bin which further disrupted the visitors’ rhythm. Dan Cole and Ryan Bower rumbled on to stiffen the Tigers’ front five and consolation tries for hooker Charlie Clare and flanker Luke Wallace offered the brief illusion of a proper contest to which Borthwick and his coaches could cling. There seems little wrong with the Tigers’ collective spirit and endeavour but, at this level, extreme makeovers do not happen overnight."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f538f1aafbcd74e3499879f35908de43ec759e85/0_100_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=19b290415d0e437aee79178510183d14","title":"sophia popov gives herself a chance of unlikely triumph at womens open","story":"Glory for Sophia Popov in the Women’s Open would represent one of the most staggering tales in a routine sporting year, let alone one as unorthodox as this. The lack of awareness relating to Hinako Shibuno, who triumphed at Woburn 12 months ago, was generally UK-centric. Shibuno had arrived at the event when 44th in the world and fresh from wins in Japan. Popov headed to Royal Troon, where experience is supposedly a crucial commodity, as ranked 304th.Much of her 2020 has been spent on the Cactus Tour, which controversially ploughed on in competitive form during lockdown with purses of about $3,000. By Sunday evening, Popov could be $675,000 richer for following in the footsteps of Bernhard Langer and Martin Kaymer as a German major champion. Heads would turn.Popov has no main tour victories to her name as a professional. She only qualified for this major in early August, thanks to a top-10 finish at the Marathon Classic in Ohio. A week earlier and because she didn’t have sufficient status to play herself, Popov caddied for Anne Van Dam as the LPGA Tour emerged from shutdown.The 27-year-old, born in the United States but of German nationality, has a best Women’s Open finish of tied 67th that was nine years ago when still a teenage amateur. Popov’s pre-tournament odds of 100-1 actually appeared unfathomably short. There’s a time-honoured reason bookmakers tend not to be paupers.With just 18 holes to play, Popov’s advantage over the field is three. When pressure should supposedly be intense, the leader performed apparently free from any nerves at all. A 67, equalling the low round of the week, has been added to earlier rounds of 70 and 72 for a four-under-par aggregate. She can’t, can she? Raw numbers quell cynical assessment.The 8th hole of the second round marks the last time Popov dropped a shot. She illustrated an ability to deliver the spectacular with a driver, as played from the fairway on the par five 4th a day later. Fortune favoured the brave Popov found herself within 10ft of the hole, from where she converted for eagle. At the penultimate hole, the three-shot margin was opened up courtesy of a 30ft birdie putt. Popov’s position would be even better but for a birdie try at the last she left agonisingly short.Given the tournament’s organisers are due immense credit for smooth delivery of an international event, the range of flags as adorn the leaderboard is appropriate. Germany, Thailand, Australia, Denmark, New Zealand, the United States and Korea all feature prominently.Minjee Lee and Jasmine Suwannapura complete just a trio of players under par, with both at minus one. Suwannapura made a bogey at the last for a 69, with Lee posting the same Saturday score. Austin Ernst was even par before a bogey at the last.In what is a wonderfully congested competitive scene, Lydia Ko could yet emerge as Popov’s greatest threat. The one-time teenage prodigy, still only 23, returned a 72 to sit at two over. If Ko wins here, the reverberations throughout golf will be significant.Lindsey Weaver, who is still very much in contention at one ahead of Ko, used day three to produce one of the marquee moments of the tournament so far. The American seemed to turn away in disgust after chopping out from an ancient dune behind the 12th green. To Weaver’s shock, the ball rolled into the hole for an unlikely par. The 26-year-old is conjuring memories of the 19th-century major antics of Mungo Park by looking to prevail minus the services of a caddie.1st (-4)\u0026nbspS\u0026nbspPopov (Ger) 70 72 672nd (-1)\u0026nbspJ\u0026nbspSuwannapura (Tha) 71 72 69 M\u0026nbspLee (Aus) 74 69 694th (+1)\u0026nbspA\u0026nbspErnst (US) 72 70 72 L\u0026nbspWeaver (US) 71 72 71 C\u0026nbspMasson (Ger) 72 74 687th (+2)\u0026nbspE\u0026nbspK Pedersen (Den) 71 72 72 L\u0026nbspKo (NZ) 72 71 72 K\u0026nbspGillman (US) 75 72 6810th (+3)\u0026nbspC\u0026nbspClanton (US) 74 73 69 J\u0026nbspSong (US) 74 74 68 K\u0026nbspKirk (Aus) 72 77 6713th (+4)\u0026nbspA\u0026nbspJutanugarn (Tha) 73 74 70 N\u0026nbspKorda (US) 72 72 73 A\u0026nbspLee (US) 74 73 70 Park I (Kor) 77 69 71 Chun I-g (Kor) 72 75 70 M\u0026nbspKhang (US) 75 70 7219th (+5)\u0026nbspY\u0026nbspNoh (US) 72 73 73 A\u0026nbspNordqvist (Swe) 71 74 73 M\u0026nbspUeda (Jpn) 75 75 68 L\u0026nbspPace (SA) 71 74 73 A\u0026nbspSharp (Can) 71 74 73 D\u0026nbspHolmqvist (Swe) 71 70 77 B\u0026nbspAltomare (US) 77 72 6926th (+6)\u0026nbspC\u0026nbspInglis (US) 75 71 73 J\u0026nbspShin (US) 77 73 69 N\u0026nbspIturrios (Sp) 71 74 74 A\u0026nbspMunoz (Sp) 74 75 70 M\u0026nbspReid (Eng) 78 73 68 A\u0026nbspBuhai (SA) 74 73 72 L\u0026nbspSalas (US) 73 74 7233rd (+7)\u0026nbspJ\u0026nbspEwart Shadoff (Eng) 73 75 72 E\u0026nbspSzokol (US) 72 74 74 D\u0026nbspFinkelstein (US) 77 71 72 H\u0026nbspNomura (Jpn) 74 70 76 H\u0026nbspGreen (Aus) 75 72 73 A\u0026nbspStanford (US) 73 74 73 M\u0026nbspJutanugarn (Tha) 77 73 7040th (+8)\u0026nbspM\u0026nbspAlex (US) 70 79 72 B\u0026nbspMorgan (Wal) 74 73 74 C\u0026nbspMatthew (Sco)\u0026nbsp 71 76 74 A\u0026nbspLee (US) 72 77 72 Yan J (Chn) 77 73 7145th (+9)\u0026nbspS\u0026nbspMeadow (NI) 75 75 72 M\u0026nbspPressel (US) 77 74 71 P\u0026nbspDelacour (Fr) 75 74 73 C\u0026nbspHerbin (Fr) 74 75 73 C\u0026nbspKnight (US) 76 75 71 C\u0026nbspCiganda (Sp) 77 74 71 A van Dam (Ned) 77 72 73 B\u0026nbspLaw (Eng) 80 70 7253rd (+10)\u0026nbspA\u0026nbspOlson (US) 67 81 75 G Hall (Eng) 73 76 74 S\u0026nbspSmith (Aus) 78 73 72 L\u0026nbspFuenfstueck (Ger) 73 78 7257th (+11)\u0026nbspE\u0026nbspTalley (US) 77 73 74 Lee M-h (Kor) 76 71 77 Yang A (Kor) 73 76 75 P\u0026nbspLindberg (Swe) 75 75 74 A\u0026nbspMcDonald (US) 74 75 7562nd (+12)\u0026nbspD\u0026nbspKang (US) 76 74 7563rd (+13)\u0026nbspA\u0026nbspYin (US) 75 74 77 G\u0026nbspLopez (Mex) 71 80 75 N\u0026nbspHataoka (Jpn) 74 77 75 S\u0026nbspGal (Ger) 74 74 78 J\u0026nbspGranada (Pry) 77 73 7668th (+14)\u0026nbspF\u0026nbspJohnson (Eng) 76 74 77 M\u0026nbspTorres (Pue) 76 72 79 D\u0026nbspArdina (Phl) 78 73 7671st (+16)\u0026nbspS\u0026nbspKyriacou (Aus) 73 78 78 C\u0026nbspLennarth (Swe) 75 76 7873rd (+17)\u0026nbspM\u0026nbspThomson (Sco) 73 77 8074th (+19)\u0026nbspJ\u0026nbspGustavsson (Swe) 73 75 84On what was the most tame day of the competition in terms of the weather, opportunities were plentiful. Caroline Masson acknowledged as much after a 68, which left her just five from the lead. “It was a little bit easier than the last couple of days,” said the German. “It was just a little less wind. But it’s still tough, no doubt about it. There’s a lot of crosswind.“You always make the turn here and think it gets easier but it doesn’t, because that wind is coming in hard off the left on the back nine. You have to really focus, you have to hit good shots and think your way around a little bit. If you get out of position, take bogey if possible and move on. I think we have done a good job doing that.”Catriona Matthew’s 74 slipped Europe’s Solheim Cup captain back to eight over par. Georgia Hall is plus 10 but Mel Reid, who came within a shot of missing the cut, signed for a 68 to move inside the top 30 at six over.All eyes, though, are on Popov. She won when the Cactus Tour stopped at Arizona’s Troon North in late May. This could be quite the double."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff57822e42f774362ed4d606afb5b3faa6996a6f/0_0_3574_2144/master/3574.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=264e41086a04288dc406df100274e628","title":"zak crawleys huge double century lifts england and floors pakistan","story":"The England cricket team under Joe Root has rarely been renowned for its ruthlessness. They have often been highly entertaining they have conjured some stunning victories there have been crazy collapses and one fancy declaration. But on Saturday they clinically ground Pakistan down, allowing them no way back into the game. They amassed a mammoth total of 583 for eight, whereupon Jimmy Anderson took three Pakistan wickets at the end of an extended final session.Look at the figures: Zak Crawley hit a monumental 267 his partnership of 359 with Jos Buttler was the record for the fifth wicket for England perhaps most startling of all Buttler, the swashbuckler supreme, did not hit a boundary throughout the entire afternoon session. Instead he sat happily on his bat handle, after reaching his second Test century two years and 24 matches after his first, and continued to admire the silky stroke play of Crawley. Both of them played the longest innings of their careers.Crawley added another 96 runs to his overnight score in that time Buttler scored 50, which highlights the nature of England’s progression. Once Crawley had become the third youngest English double centurion in history – after Sir Len Hutton and David Gower (no pressure there then) – he unveiled the memorable shots of the day: there were timeless, classical cover drives and impudent 21st-century reverse sweeps. But even Crawley, on 171 at the start, was prepared to graft throughout the early overs when there was rain in the air and some spring in the steps of the Pakistan bowlers, who beat the bat frequently enough to give hope of some wickets.England were obviously set upon a mammoth score. Maybe having studied the forecast, which suggests the weather deteriorates on Tuesday, England reckoned they would have to enforce the follow-on to win. The plan was to bat once in the match, so that even when their total was beyond 500 there was still an unusual caginess to their batting.So for much of the day the cricket lacked the tension that has been prevalent throughout most of the summer, although there were a few hearts beating more quickly when Buttler was given out caught behind against Mohammad Abbas on 99. An immediate review, however, demonstrated that Buttler’s bat had hit his pad and not the ball. The next delivery was punched away on the off side and he could celebrate a long-awaited century. Argue about who keeps wicket if you like, but Buttler has to be in the team now, especially against spin-orientated sides in the sub-continent.So does Crawley after this match. Batsmen new to Test cricket are usually most perplexed by the paucity of poor deliveries, which makes run-scoring at their normal rate a major challenge. But this has not applied to Crawley this summer. He is a natural aggressor and he does not seem bothered what sort of game he is playing. This could be attributed to the glorious naivety of the newcomer but it seems more likely that he possesses a simple, clear-headed approach allied to the maturity to recognise that he should just trust his game. He bats with a smile, something which was especially evident when surpassing the double century scored by his friend and mentor, Rob Key. The anticipation now is that Crawley will surpass Key’s 15 Tests for England.So the partnership flourished long into the afternoon there were a few flourishes from Crawley and none at all from Buttler. The quartet of frontline bowlers never wilted yet their efforts were only rewarded when Shaheen Afridi bowled Stuart Broad, which prompted Joe Root to declare on 583 for eight. The other three wickets to fall were shared by the part-timers, which is often a source of frustration to the true foot soldiers.Eventually Crawley ran down the wicket to the low-slung off-breaks of Asad Shafiq, who bowled mostly outside of leg stump, and he was stumped by the ever-alert Mohammad Rizwan. Unusually Buttler was unable to change gear and he ended up presenting Fawad Alam with a simple return catch. But he did have 152 at the time. Chris Woakes hit a neat 40 before driving to cover off Fawad, while Dom Bess and Broad swished merrily until the latter’s dismissal.Pakistan had 13 overs to negotiate and this was always going to be a trial after so long in the field, especially for Shan Masood. He scored a gritty, career-best 156 in the first Test but no one has tormented him like Anderson. Masood probably knew what was coming but he could not do much about it. In his second over Anderson found that devilish swing into the left-hander’s pads and Masood was lbw, despite a desperate, ill-advised review from the batsman. This was the eighth time that Anderson had dismissed Masood in Test cricket.Now the force was with Anderson the dark Dukes was swinging just enough. In his next over Abid Ali pushed forward tentatively and the edge was well held by Dominic Sibley at third slip. Then Babar Azam was trapped in front. Pakistan had been cornered – ruthlessly."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/20b5ff68794323d4ed3fe8f621127f6fd324b684/0_461_3543_2127/master/3543.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=18f3173896eee4821efe894590529a79","title":"pick up basketball bounces back after covid cancellation photo essay","story":"With courts locked and hoops removed in lockdown the sense of community was missed as much as the sport. Now it’s ‘such a relief’ to be backby  Kieran Pender, photography by Nick Lawrence and video by  Carly EarlJacinta Govind has had a lifelong love affair with the sport of basketball. She first picked up a ball at age eight, attended Sydney Kings games with her family and watched footage of the era-defining Chicago Bulls alongside her NBA-obsessed older brother. Govind’s ability saw her rise through high-school ranks to the heights of the WNBL, Australia’s professional league, spending a year with the Canberra Capitals. “I probably didn’t stop playing basketball from the time I was eight until I was 22,” she recalls.After a hiatus while she trained as an occupational therapist, Govind was lured back to the courts of Terrigal on the NSW Central Coast by the sport’s purest form: pick-up basketball. “It was the first-time I could play just for fun,” she says.Pick-up is unstructured, free-flowing basketball, organised on an ad hoc basis at thousands of indoor and outdoor courts across Australia. There are no referees, no scoreboards and few rules. “Playing pick-up helped me find my passion for basketball again,” Govind says. “If I made a mistake, no one would care. If I missed all the shots, no one would care. If I played like Kobe, everyone would cheer. It’s just fun.”Covid-19 changed all that. When community sport was restricted in March and then ultimately prohibited, these informal basketball games were among the casualties. Courts were locked, hoops were removed from outdoor facilities and police patrolled popular shoot-around locations. For hundreds of pick-up communities, the impact was immense.“It was a real struggle,” says Fadzayi Chambati. Zai, as the 19-year-old Zimbabwe-born Chambati is known to his pick-up opponents, had dropped out of university to focus on training at the beginning of 2020. He had hoped to secure a basketball scholarship at an American college, with aspirations of a professional career. “Everyone went through a rough time,” he says. “But I also found it brought me closer to people. Some guys I knew through pick-up – one gave me a hoop, another gave me a ball, to enable me to keep training.”Govind, who was midway through rehabilitation from an ankle injury, also found herself alone on one of the few outdoor courts that were still accessible. “Sometimes I would shoot by myself, but it just wasn’t the same,” she says. “I felt really lost.”For many pick-up enthusiasts, the loss of community was felt just as keenly as the absence of the actual basketball. Nick Jackson missed pick-up more acutely than most. From Perth originally, Jackson had lived in Europe for much of the past decade – playing basketball wherever he went. In February, he moved to Sydney and initially found himself immersed in the pick-up scene in Redfern. “It was a great way to get to know people,” says Jackson. “Then lockdown happened. They literally locked the courts.”In NSW, community sport was permitted to return in early July. Pick-up games were quickly back in full flow. “I didn’t realise how much I missed it until I went back again – seeing all those familiar faces,” says Govind. For Jackson, after a long stint alone, the social aspect was particularly important. “It has been good just to chat with people again – talk about basketball and what is going on in the NBA. Everyone missed it.”Throughout lockdown, Chambati was determined not to let Covid-19 derail his international basketball ambitions. “I was itching to get back on the court,” he tells  Australia from the United States, having just arrived in Kentucky after finally securing a college sporting scholarship. “Basketball was the only thing on my mind.” Having trained alone during April, May and June, Chambati found his game had actually improved. “Covid-19 gave me an opportunity to practice,” he continues. “In the first game back, no one was expecting anyone to be good – but I was lighting it up! It was such a relief to be back.”Photographer Nick Lawrence’s Pick Up People project explores stories from the basketball court.

The devastating reverse sweep. The disdainful ramp over the shoulder. The beefy off-side punch. Only there was something strange. Buttler wasn’t the one playing any of these shots at all.Instead, in a curious reversal of roles it was Zak Crawley, the new crown prince of English batting, who was flaying Pakistan to all parts with a mixture of effortless timing and agricultural hitting.Buttler, by contrast, was the one dropping anchor: holding up an end, biding his time.Even as the runs piled up and England chased a declaration, he continued to plug away: nudging and pushing for singles, resolutely playing every ball on its merits.And so, on a day stuffed with weird anomalies, of outlandish numbers and unfamiliar sights and sounds, perhaps the strangest of all was this: one of England’s most destructive and flamboyant batsmen posting his highest Test score almost unnoticed, the leading man willingly accepting a non-speaking role. He scored at less than three an over for most of the day, and between 1.36pm and 5.31pm he went 41 overs without hitting a boundary.Yet for all its uncharacteristic absence of pizzazz, this may well have been one of the most important innings Buttler has played in his life, certainly against a red ball.We knew what he could do with a white ball. We knew what he could do with a target. We knew what he could do for a couple of lawless hours on the counterattack, or in a lost cause.But a mature 152 off 311 balls, made with impenetrable defence and impeccable judgement: did we truly believe Buttler had an innings like this in him?Perhaps some of us did. For much of his England career, Buttler was one of those who did not. The unique scrutiny of Test cricket has always been apt to open up certain fissures in him, not just in his game but in his confidence. For Buttler, this sense of atrophy and decay, of circling vultures and spiralling doubt, has been pursuing him for most of the last five years. Arguably it is the dominant theme of his Test career, far more than his occasional flourishes or defiant cameos.The doubt first began to set in during the summer of 2015, barely a year after his debut, as the runs began to dry up in the Ashes. It resurfaced in late 2016 during a disastrous tour of India. And more recently over the winter, after a poor tour of South Africa and a run of 14 consecutive innings without a half-century. Once again, a prevailing scepticism reigned over whether Buttler really was a Test batsman, or simply an impostor in whites.For some, Buttler could never simply be a decent player going through a bad trot.There always had to be that undercurrent of fraudulence, of masquerade, even a certain vulgarity in the idea that a white-ball specialist might try and cut it in the most beautiful game of all.Limited-overs cricket may not quite carry the same sackcloth and stigma as it once did, but in many quarters of the English game there remains a certain exceptionalism to Test cricket that still brooks an instinctive suspicion of a player like Buttler. He doesn’t have the technique or the temperament. He hasn’t “figured out” how to play Test cricket. He’s had enough chances.Few players of any ilk get a fourth crack at Test cricket. It feels fairly certain that Buttler would not have been one of them. Indeed, had the pandemic not curtailed England’s tour of Sri Lanka, Buttler might easily have been dropped in favour of Ben Foakes, a superior keeper against spin bowling. He might easily have been lost to the Test game forever. He might have been forced to content himself with being “merely” England’s greatest white-ball batsman in history.The malaise persisted into the summer, even afflicting his usually tidy keeping. But by his principal measure of worth, Buttler has finally proven himself.Since the start of the summer, when his place was under threat, he averages 52 with 416 runs over the six Tests. His balance at the crease appears much improved. His remodelled trigger movement allows him to judge his off-stump without cutting off his favoured scoring areas through cover. And this innings was the missing piece of the puzzle: a test of temperament as well as mettle, walking in at 127 for four on Friday afternoon and not leaving until the series was won. Forty-seven Tests into his career, it finally feels like Buttler belongs.It is instructive that both of Buttler’s Test centuries – as well as his only genuine match-winning knock, the brilliant 75 at Old Trafford two Tests ago – have come at No 6. Perhaps, as with Ben Stokes, Buttler has finally managed to strike a balance between freedom and responsibility. All of which raises the issue of where he slots in when Stokes returns. Does he drop back to No 7? Do you drop a batsman and bring in Foakes for the tour of Sri Lanka? In a strange way, Buttler’s resurrection has raised more questions for England than it has answered. But unlike many of their recent selection dilemmas, it is a wonderful one to have."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9869d06b77bb8c5c87e5e9a75c4fb2ad1cc19f32/21_0_5368_3223/master/5368.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3481514b26043ac8482a25222b257867","title":"italians do it better an expert guide to hosting an amalfi inspired dinner party","story":"Giulia Rhodes speaks to some in-the-know Italians about how stunning seafood and verdant produce can add a touch of the Amalfi coast to your next dinner partyFrom authors and actors to designers and directors, the glamorous set has long flocked to Italy’s Amalfi coast. And it’s not hard to see why.A film-set perfect 25-mile ribbon of mountainous coastline, its colourful villages, fragrant lemon groves and deep blue sea form a Unesco world heritage site.And as with all Italian regions, the local food and drink is inextricably tied to the culture which means that even if you can’t actually strut your stuff in Positano, you can cook up a bit of Italian sunshine in your kitchen.Alessandro Savelli is CEO and founder of UK-based Pasta Evangelists, which makes premium fresh pasta and sauces for home cooking – with next day delivery across the UK – in addition to its coveted concession in Harrods, now back open for business following the easing of lockdown restrictions.He learned to make pasta with his grandmother. Step one, he says, is to understand the culture. “I am Italian. I love food. I love pasta. I love cooking. Meals in Italy are when the family comes together to talk and enjoy delicious food. It is the highlight of our day. Food is not just seen as a necessity.”He celebrates the regional roots of Italian cuisine, sharing culture and stories to support local speciality pasta dishes. The food of the southern Italian Amalfi coast is different to that of his native Genoa, in the north, but it is close to his heart.“We go every year. My wife is from Naples and we married in Capri. I love it. The people are friendly, funny and loud, and the cuisine has everything – from amazing fish and seafood, fruits and vegetables to wonderful pizza and pasta. I discovered dishes that only really exist in that area.”His personal favourite is spaghetti alla nerano, with fried courgette and provolone cheese. While scialatielli – somewhere between linguine and tagliatelle in shape – with Amalfi lemon, ‘nduja sausage and mascarpone, features on the Pasta Evangelists’ Amalfi week menu.“Pasta dishes are about simplicity, freshness and few ingredients. We can bring that to your home,” he says. Although he admits he can’t deliver the full experience. “In Italy, we do tend to take the sunshine for granted.”Carla Bollati, a retired doctor from Turin, was introduced to the area around Amalfi by her late partner Gennaro, a Neapolitan. “I have a deep sentimental attachment,” she says. “And the tastes are a lovely way to travel to happy memories.”She was struck by the area’s scenery from her first visit. “It is a crowded landscape that cannot be changed. But there is also such special light and colour, the perfume of lemons, so many wonderful flavours. All the senses are covered.”The people and cuisine of the south are, she says, another huge draw. “They cook with what the area has to offer. Try a mozzarella there and you will understand what it is supposed to be.”Culinary roots and rules are revered, she adds. “If I cooked Neapolitan pasta e fagioli – with beans – for Gennaro, it had to be with broken odds and ends of pasta. Shells just wouldn’t be right. We Italians are so tied to the history of our food and the habit of coming together to eat it.”Italian food expert and cook, Paola Maggiulli, who runs the Tiny Italian supper clubs and cookery courses, agrees. But she insists it is a very inclusive tradition. To create an authentic Italian dinner, she says, the starting point is confidence.“Anyone can make Italian food. It is about flavour, not technique. With a few quality ingredients you can make incredible dishes.”Having spent much of her childhood in her father’s south London Italian deli, she recommends taking time to shop for good ingredients and learn the stories behind them.“In normal times, what is special about Italian food is the connection and time with other people. That might be planning the menu with friends or helping your grandmother prepare Sunday lunch for the extended family. Community and family are everything. Sharing the experience of eating with people you care about just makes you feel better.”So what would Maggiulli serve for a feelgood dinner inspired by the Amalfi coast?“I would want those incredible lemons,” she says, suggesting simple spaghetti with lemon, parmesan, olive oil and basil as a first course.“Amalfi seafood is beautiful, too. So perhaps a main of braised octopus, mussels cooked in white wine, or a frittura mista platter of fried squid and prawns,” she says. A chocolate and almond cake – a torta caprese after the island of Capri – would end the meal nicely.When you host your party, build the convivial atmosphere by serving the food on large dishes in the middle of the table, for guests to help themselves, and make sure the conversation, as well as the drinks, are flowing.For the latter, Daniele Umoette, former bar manager and drinks brand ambassador from Carpi in the northern region of Emilia-Romagna, suggests a gin spritz aperitif to kickstart the evening.“Mix blood orange flavoured Malfy Gin Con Arancia with Fever Tree Sicilian Lemon Tonic and a splash of prosecco over lots of ice in a nice glass, and garnish with some fruit such as blackberries, pink grapefruit slice and some aromatic herbs such as sage,” he says.Admittedly, your after-dinner stroll will probably be a little less glamorous than the nightly passeggiata in Positano. Maybe next year.

In the early days it formed the basis of many a #quarantini – made from whatever we might have left in the cupboard. Since then, the hashtag has clocked up more than 87,000 posts and the term has passed into the popular lexicon. Now, take it a notch higher for the ultimate cocktail moment. With Malfy Gin, you can create the most authentic Italian style aperitivo hour. Try a Malfy Gin Rosa G\u0026ampT by mixing a measure of Malfy Gin Rosa with Mediterranean tonic in a copa glass over ice and garnishing with a pink grapefruit wheel. Or, for an added touch of sophistication, mix a measure of Malfy Gin Rosa with 50ml prosecco and 50ml San Pellegrino Arraciata Rossa over ice in a wine glass, and garnish with an orange wheel, strawberry slice and sprig of thyme to create a Amalfi Sunset Spritz.Front-room festivalsIf you missed glamping it up at Glasto or living it up at Latitude this summer, there’s nothing to stop you recreating that festival feeling right in your front room. This year, with staycations booming, boutique bell tents are all the rage, and whether you’re a Hyde Park regular, or head to the Isle of Wight every summer, you don’t have to miss out. Pitch your tent in the garden – or indoors if it’s raining – swing open the patio doors, pour yourself a Malfy Gin and tonic, and cue up your festival playlist. Designer wellies optional.UpcyclingNesting has taken on new meaning as we’re spending more time than ever at home, meaning that we are looking to make our personal spaces as cosy and reassuring as possible. With major home improvement projects put on hold, we’re looking at subtler ways to spruce up our living spaces, often going hand-in-hand with the crafts we’ve taken up to help while away our extended free time. Repurposing old units and reupholstering much-loved chairs are at the top of many DIY lists – and when it comes to themes and patterns, rainbows and bright, uplifting shades are the order of the day.Micro garden partiesWith our close friends and family having been out of bounds for so long, we’re getting to know the neighbours. WhatsApp groups for inidual streets and blocks of flats are springing up across the country as we look closer to home for friendship, support and entertainment.Scaled-down garden parties comprising small groups of neighbours dressing up and bringing over their own food and drinks – nibbled and sipped at a respectful distance – make for eclectic gatherings and unexpected new friendships being forged.Staying ‘in-in’Now we can no longer go “out-out” – and with loungewear fatigue firmly setting in – summer is about dressing up for virtual socialising. Many of us are seeing more of our friends than ever as we plan regular catch-ups via online video calling, from family quizzes to propping up a virtual bar with friends, while Royal Ascot 2020 saw thousands of us donning fascinators in front of the TV in aid of frontline charities. So as the weather warms up, it’s time to cast off your lockdown look and raise a glass of Malfy Gin in style.Locally sourced picnicsWith public transport still only used for essential travel and some of our favourite parks and gardens closed, we’re exploring the green spaces closer to home for a suitable patch of grass on which to spread our blankets.The best-dressed picnic baskets are filled with treats that support local producers, from honey collected by local beekeepers and veg from the farmer’s market, to unique small-batch cheeses and British charcuterie sliced on to artisanal sourdough. Explore your local high street to see what gems you can unearth.Home cooking with a little helpOnce we realised how much mess keeping a sourdough starter alive entails, the appeal of devoting ourselves to becoming expert home chefs faded fairly fast. With more food businesses pivoting to offer meal kits designed to be finished off at home for that personal touch, there’s no better time to start enjoying gourmet food delivered to your door (without worrying about it getting cold). For a taste of Italy, Pasta Evangelists offer artisan pasta and sauces via next-day delivery across the UK, which can be whipped up at home in minutes. With dishes inspired by culinary traditions found across Italy, from Venice to Sicily, you can be taken on a foodie journey with all the taste and minimum effort.Growing lupinsSince lockdown began, gardening has shot up in popularity, with garden centres opening some time before other non-essential businesses. From window sills to flower beds, this summer is about attempting to turn green spaces into a riot of colour to rival the rainbows pinned in people’s windows, and the West Country Lupin has been particularly popular. Packed with uplifting colour, lupins are easy to grow and soothing to look at, making them the ideal flower to plant this summer.Virtual destination toursGrounded globetrotters are fulfilling their wanderlust by taking virtual tours of some of the world’s most stunning spots. Choose from tours offering 360-degree views of popular destinations such as Tokyo or Machu Picchu, or watch a live stream from San Diego Zoo or California’s Monterey Bay Aquarium.You can even take a treadmill walk through the Colosseum – made even more authentic by concocting a refreshing gin spritz with Malfy Gin Rosa to take with you on your virtual tour.CottagecoreAnyone not ensconced in a countryside pad with an acre or two of garden attached is currently looking enviously towards the idyllic-looking lockdowns of those who are. As even the most ardent city-dweller wrests with sourdough starters and homemade crumpets, we’re being calmed by a trend that has been dubbed “cottagecore” – an aesthetic oozing with images of perfect-looking pies, vases filled with wildflowers and verdant countryside. Get the look by adding some floral frocks or shirts to your wardrobe.Malfy Gin is available to purchase in selected Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Morrisons, Asda, M\u0026ampS, Waitrose and Co-op stores, as well as Ocado and the Malfy Gin Amazon brand storePlease drink Malfy Gin responsibly.

Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillClaire Twomey’s coronavirus journey started mildly enough – and hasn’t stopped.“Initially, it was only a headache, and sinus pain last March, and I lost the sense of taste and smell. Then I spent four or five days in bed with a ferocious fever, a cough and migraines.”She attempted to go back to work, but her fever and cough worsened and she spent another four weeks in bed with a high temperature.Despite periods of apparent improvement, months later, she’s still coughing. “A trip up the stairs aggravates the cough. I go to the shops and I suffer a loss of breath.Ms Twomey is one of a large and increasing cohort of coronavirus patients who are experiencing longer-term effects of the disease. In Ireland and across the world, doctors are linking the virus to a bewildering variety of symptoms and, as time goes on, they are finding many of these are slow to resolve.Dublin GP Nuala O’Farrell describes the virus as “the imitator of all known diseases”.“Headache, dry cough and fever, we all know about. Diarrhoea, blistery lesions that look vaguely like shingles on the trunk, chilblains, chest pain, tachycardia, arrhythmias, pericarditis (swelling of heart tissue) and of course elderly people who are just ‘not themselves’, can all be symptoms of Covid.”Rollercoaster rideA number of her patients have been on a rollercoaster ride of symptoms since contracting the disease. “One woman went from doing spinning classes four times a week to, two weeks after testing positive, being hardly able to walk up the stairs. Her head was splitting, she had no sense of taste or smell and every bone in her body was aching. Eight weeks on, she is only beginning to recover.”Ms Twomey, too, has found that being fit provided little protection against the disease. “I did yoga, I ran. Now if I try to do anything, I have to take to the bed for four or five hours. I have aches in my arms and legs. I’ve gastro issues, and tingling sensations on my skin.”“When we say that the vast majority of people have a mild illness and recover that is true,” says Dr Mike Ryan, the World Health Organisation’s head of emergencies. “But what we cannot say at the moment is what are the potential long-term impacts of having had that infection.“We hope that everybody who recovers from Covid-19 will make a full and permanent recovery but there are enough people out there having difficulties with their exercise tolerance, having difficulties with their breathing and potentially having long-term impacts on their cardiovascular system.”International findings dovetail with the experiences of some Irish patients. One international study suggested 10 to 15 per cent of people, including some mild cases, do not enjoy a quick recovery. In Italy, 87 per cent of one group of patients who had been hospitalised were still struggling two months later.It remains too early in this novel pandemic to say how long patients’ symptoms will endure, and whether the virus will give rise to chronic disease.The ergence in patients’ symptoms is driven by the varying way the virus attacks the body, often leading to inflammation and blood clotting as well as respiratory ailments.Notable too is the number of patients who say they were previously fit and healthy but are now having lasting problems, as well as “up and down” nature of many patients’ recoveries.SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, is proving remarkably adept at disrupting many areas of activity in the body. It uses a spike protein to attach itself onto cells’ ACE2 receptors, found in the lungs, heart, gut, kidneys, blood vessels and nervous system. Often, the damage is done as much by the overweening inflammatory reaction of the body as to the original infection.“We still don’t know what we’re grappling with in terms of the long-term cardiac manifestations,” says consultant cardiologist Dr Crochan O’Sullivan. “The interaction between the virus and the ACE2 enzyme triggers its entry into cells in the body.”Stroke is a particular risk linked to coronavirus given the role of the virus in making patients more susceptible to blood clotting.Ms Twomey says what really exhausts her is having to deal with three or four issues at the same time. “The fatigue is like nothing I’ve ever experienced in my life. It’s like a crash.”Her yo-yo experience of the disease prompts her to remark that “my recovery is worse than the initial experience”.Along with her parents, who also tested positive for the virus, she attends the Mater post-coronavirus clinic in Dublin. “They’ve been great,” she says, “but there’s only so much they can do. They still don’t know the answers”.Dr Killian Hurley is a respiratory consultant at Beaumont Hospital, where he heads up a post-coronavirus clinic, and the RSCI. Over the last six months the clinic, which takes referrals only from patients who were hospitalised, has seen more than 100 patients.Severe fatigueThe clinic provides patients with access to specialists from a variety of disciplines including respiratory medicine, intensive care, infectious diseases, psychology and psychiatry.Dr Hurley says patients come with a wide variety of lasting symptoms, including continuous shortness of breath, cough, severe fatigue, anxiety and other mental health issues.Some of those who spent periods in intensive care are suffering a form of post-traumatic stress disorder, he says.Many have lung problems months after their disease experience. “They still have abnormalities on their chest X-rays there’s scarring there, particularly among those who were in intensive care.”For a small group, even walking a short distance after six months causes them difficulties. Generally Dr Hurley finds that the more severe their illness was, the more severe are their continuing after-effects.“This is a totally new disease. We don’t have 40 years of research into this. My sense is, though, that it will be a mild disease for many, with a good chance of eventual recovery.”However, many patients are “terrified”, he acknowledges, and “frightened about what the future might hold”.Stressing the need to identify problems early, he says the health service needs to be proactive in following through with patients in a standardised way.This is difficult when only 50 to 75 per cent of health service capacity is available due to coronavirus restrictions, and while the system is continuing to battle new infections.He says his “hope” is that the residual problems of most patients will resolve over the space of a year, as happened with other respiratory syndromes.Ms Twomey has set up an online support group for coronavirus survivors, which now has more than 400 members.The Facebook group is providing a forum for discussion, sharing of experiences and guidance.Suffering“People feel they don’t have answers to their questions. They’re frustrated because there isn’t one place for them to go to seek those answers,” she says.Many people suffering symptoms, including those who were never tested because their symptoms didn’t meet the criteria in place at the time, and those whose tests came back negative, are not eligible to attend the clinics and so have to plot inidual recovery journeys.But in mid-April she developed fatigue and nausea. One day she “couldn’t get out of bed”.Because she had only one of the symptoms required at the time to be sent for testing, she never got a diagnosis.She says her condition worsened, as she developed shortness of breath and heart palpitations, “brain fog” and loss of memory.“It came that I couldn’t remember the right word to use in a situation. Or I would be looking at words and not recognising them, or saying the wrong word,” she says.Eventually she got a test, but to her distress it came back negative.Still her condition did not improve. “I used to run or walk 15km a day, but now I couldn’t leave the house. I’d have a couple of good days, and think things were fabulous for a week. And then the next day, it would hit me like a train again.”Still suffering from a “rollercoaster of symptoms” after 16 weeks, she had to stop working and tending her garden. “I’ve had relapse after relapse. It’s the uncertainty and the not knowing that is so hard to take, not being able to live a normal life and the impact on your mental health.”She realises others have it worse but wonders how long her symptoms will persist.“I don’t think I can cope with another six months of this. People don’t understand how long term this can be, and the damage that can be done.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Woman is first prisoner to test positive for coronavirus in the RepublicHundreds attend event which passes off largely peacefullyDublin-Belfast service \u0026lsquohad higher than anticipated demand\u0026rsquo, company saysOne third of people surveyed say they gained weight, as one fifth worry about food suppliesCompletion from test referral to contact tracing now taking 2.1 days \u0026ndash HSEPolice across district self-isolating and will be tested, says senior commanderBelfast court told that MI5 were involved in PSNI investigationBid underway to replace 175-year-old monkey puzzle tree which fell in Cork during stormAccused ordered to surrender his passport, sign on daily and keep a curfew while on bailEstimated 25,000 Hindus living in Ireland, says director of Vedic Hindu Cultural CentreShannon Heritage had warned heritage sites would close in less than two weeksMartin says new Covid-19 law will target businesses \u0026lsquoendangering public health\u0026rsquo rather than house partiesAs patients report longer-term effects, it remains too early to say how long symptoms will lastPoliticians would be unwise to underestimate level of public anger about revelationsHandling of crisis has transformed view, from \u0026lsquopale, male and stale\u0026rsquoJohn Mullan (49), children Tom\u0026aacutes (14) and Amelia (6) die but mother Geraldine survivesInternal study for first time details force\u0026rsquos relationship with ethnic minoritiesSinn F\u0026eacutein leader says event, attended by more than 80 people, was \u0026lsquothe last straw\u0026rsquoStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4336812.1598127567!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"taoiseach and t%C3%A1naiste urge hogan to consider his position after golf dinner","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tEU Commissioner and former Fine Gael TD Phil Hogan was among the attendees at the Oireachtas Golf Society event. File image: Dara Mac DónaillThe Taoiseach Micheál Martin and Tánaiste Leo Varadkar have asked Phil Hogan to “consider his position” as EU Commissioner after attending this week’s controversial Oireachtas Golf Society dinner which breached Covid-19 regulations.“The Taoiseach and the Tánaiste did speak with the Commissioner today and asked him to consider his position,” a Government spokesperson said in a statement.“They both believe that the event should never have been held, that the Commissioner’s apology came late and that he still needs to give a full account and explanations of his action.”The move puts Mr Hogan’s future as European Commissioner for Trade in doubt and is also likely to increase pressure on Supreme Court judge Séamus Woulfe, who was also in attendance.Mr Martin and Mr Varadkar have not spoken to European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen, who would have the power to remove Mr Hogan from office. Mr Hogan’s appointment as Commissioner was ratified by the European Parliament after being nominated by the previous government.Event durationMeanwhile, the Oireachtas Golf Society also came under further pressure on Saturday to disclose the length of time more than 80 people were gathered at the dinner.Under Covid-19 restrictions announced by Taoiseach Micheál Martin and Tánaiste Leo Varadkar two weeks ago, restaurants were required to close at 11pm, with diners allowed only an hour and 45 minutes for their meals.Revised restrictions announced last Tuesday – the night before the now infamous golf dinner – extended the closing time until 11.30pm, with table numbers capped at six people.One of those in attendance at Wednesday night’s dinner at the Station House Hotel in Clifden, Co Galway, said it started shortly after 9pm.There were a choice of three starters, including soup, pate and “some vegetarian or salady thing”, followed by a choice of three main courses, including salmon and lamb, and a choice of three desserts.After the meal there were four separate speeches. Society captain and Independent TD Noel Grealish addressed attendees, who included Supreme Court judge Séamus Woulfe, EU Commissioner Phil Hogan, several senators and councillors.The society’s president and former Fianna Fáil TD and senator Donie Cassidy also made a speech, followed by Fianna Fáil councillor Donagh Killilea, who spoke on behalf of his family, who shared a table at the event.The dinner was organised to pay tribute to his late father, the former Fianna Fáil MEP and TD Mark Killilea, as well as mark the society’s 50th anniversary.The now resigned minister for agriculture Dara Calleary also made a speech commemorating the late Mr Killilea.There was also a prize-giving, and according to one person present, families of winners took time to take photos.It is understood former Fine Gael minister Mr Hogan won one of the prizes, a George Foreman grill.One attendee couldn’t recall what time people left the function room, saying some stayed on to talk afterwards before everyone “scattered”.“It’s impossible to say, I wasn’t conscious of time,” said the person, who spoke on condition of anonymity.‘Multiple breaches’ Sinn Féin president Mary Lou McDonald told The  she was concerned “to hear reports of multiple breaches of public health guidelines” at the event.“We know the number of attendees exceeded the limit, but it has now been alleged that the event also lasted far longer than the time limit permitted,” she said.“The public needs to know if multiple breaches of the guidelines occurred.“I would ask those present at the dinner to clarify whether the length of time was compliant with the regulations and to be clear about how many regulation breaches took place. The attendees must be up-front about what happened and how the rules were breached. ”Ms McDonald said the Irish public was “understandably concerned about what happened and this drip feed of information and allegations risks undermining confidence in the public health guidelines at this critical time in the fight against Covid-19”.Some attendees stayed at rooms in the hotel where the dinner took place and others stayed in at least two other hotels in the town. Some remained on at the hotel lounge in the lobby afterwards.“We were assured everything was in order,” one said.“It was a cock up anyway, with the benefit of hindsight. The dinner shouldn’t have taken place.”As well as the more than 80 attendees, there was “a pile” of staff, with one or two waiters assigned to each table, according to one of the diners.Restrictions state staff should be included when calculating maximum numbers, meaning the gathering was several multiples of the latest allowed number of six for indoor gatherings, and comfortably more than the previous cap of 50.Mr Cassidy has said he will fully cooperate with a Garda investigation into the affair.Under Covid-19 regulations it is a criminal offence to organise an event with a larger number of people than is permitted by the regulations.All-expenses trip The scandal is not the first time the Oireachtas Golf Society has courted controversy.In the summer of 2010, the society went on an all-expenses paid trip to Turkey for official celebrations of the 90th anniversary of the Turkish parliament, which had organised a golf tournament for parliamentarians from around the globe.Among those travelling were Mr Cassidy, Mr Grealish and then Carlow Kilkenny TD Mr Hogan.Then leader of the Seanad Mr Cassidy was forced to deny claims on his return that he had refused to reopen the Upper House alongside the Dáil the same week because he and his golfing colleagues were staying at the five star Sueno Hotels Golf Belek resort in the popular coastal resort Antalya.“I gave up my whole bloody weekend in the name of Ireland,” he said of his trip to Turkey at the time."},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Health condition \u0026lsquovery worrying\u0026rsquo after drinking tea that allies believe was laced with poisonDecision to transfer Kremlin critic ill with suspected poisoning after day of lobbyingProtests over last two months most serious threat yet to prime minister\u0026rsquos administrationLack of foreign visitors has facilitated increase in poaching and loss of revenueReport by US intelligence agencies sheds light on actions \u0026ndash and inactions \u0026ndash that created global crisisTens of thousands evacuated as record-breaking rains hit country\u0026rsquos southwestCountry entering dangerous new phase of rising infections in small towns and villagesUS president \u0026lsquopatently wrong\u0026rsquo when telling Minnesota crowd New Zealand situation \u0026lsquoterrible\u0026rsquoPolling put back by four weeks as 49 Covid-19 cases recorded in AucklandStudent-led demonstrations gain momentum testing laws protecting royal familyCovid-19 outbreak spreads to more than 30 people and extends beyond capitalJacinda Ardern sounds warning as number of cases in locked-down Auckland rises to 17Hundreds of police had raided Apple Daily in move decried as assault on press freedom\u0026lsquoGoing hard, going early with lockdown is still the best response,\u0026rsquo Jacinda Ardern saysReturn to nationwide restrictions announced by PM Jacinda Ardern in surprise press conferenceReaders queue from 2am to buy pro-democracy tabloid after owner Jimmy Lai\u0026rsquos arrestFair Work Commission\u0026rsquos decision that man made \u0026lsquooffensive\u0026rsquo video overturned on appealMaria Ressa\u0026rsquos news organisation Rappler is a buffer against dictatorship in PhilippinesLai has been a prominent democracy activist and an ardent critic of BeijingAuthorities warn against complacency as other countries battle a resurgenceStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4335701.1598013937!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit uk time wasting makes deal unlikely says barnier","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBrexit negotiator Michel Barnier: “Frankly I am disappointed and I am worried.”  Photograph: Yves HermanPOOLAFP via Getty ImagesThe EU’s Brexit negotiator has warned that valuable time is being wasted in trade talks with the UK as he accused his British counterparts of failing to make progress on topics of key interest to Europe during the latest round of trade negotiations. Michel Barnier said he was disappointed, concerned and surprised by the lack of progress displayed in discussions that took place in Brussels this week, reiterating that at this stage an agreement between the two sides still looked unlikely and that there was a risk the two sides would fail to ratify a deal by the end of the year. “Too often this week it felt as if we were going backwards more than forwards,” Mr Barnier said at a press conference following the conclusion of the latest negotiations. “I simply do not understand why we are wasting valuable time.” The failure to advance the discussions that began on Tuesday evening leaves only a narrow window in which to agree the text of a trade agreement, translate it into multiple European languages and obtain ratification before the post-Brexit transition period ends on December 31st. While both the UK and EU insist they want a deal, EU officials decried a lack of momentum on the British side in the wake of Thursday’s session, with one describing it as “puzzling”. David Frost, the UK’s chief negotiator, acknowledged in a separate statement that there had been “little progress” during the week’s talks, but he also insisted that a deal remained possible even if it would not be easy to achieve.State aid and fisheriesThe EU wants the two sides to push towards a common understanding on the topics of state aid and fisheries, rather than leaving these highly sensitive topics until later in the talks, but British negotiators are seeking to advance to a legal text in other areas where the two sides are closer together.Lord Frost criticised the EU’s approach on Friday. “The EU is still insisting not only that we must accept continuity with EU state aid and fisheries policy, but also that this must be agreed before any further substantive work can be done in any other area of the negotiation, including on legal texts,” he said. “This makes it unnecessarily difficult to make progress.”Mr Barnier complained that he was not seeing any willingness on the UK side to take on board the EU’s priorities, adding that the need for a “level playing field” that ensures fair competition in areas including state aid would not go away and was a non-negotiable precondition to any trade deal.“No international agreement was ever reached without the parties agreeing to common rules,” he said. The notion of a zero-tariff, zero-quota agreement without level playing field provisions and a balanced deal on fisheries was a “non-starter” for the EU, and the absence of progress in these areas was blocking everything, he warned.British negotiating officials said the talks were stalling due to the problematic issues of fishing and state aid, over which they accused the EU of seeking to maintain the status quo.“What is frustrating is that Barnier wants to see us continuing arrangements very like those we had as members of the EU. The principle of ‘Brexit means Brexit’ is a good one and should be applied across the board,” the official said.“The process block now is that we must accept their position on state aid and fisheries before we can talk about anything else. We’re obviously not going to do that, so we’re frozen.”Key concernsMr Barnier confirmed that the UK had presented a draft legal text for the trade deal during the round of talks, but he added that this had not addressed the EU’s key concerns, serving instead as a reminder of the UK’s existing positions.Lord Frost added that the UK was seeking a relationship that ensures Britain regains “sovereign control of our own laws, borders, and waters” and is similar to other agreements struck by the EU elsewhere. “When the EU accepts this reality in all areas of the negotiation, it will be much easier to make progress.” A dinner between Mr Barnier and Lord Frost was held on Thursday evening after negotiations concluded, which officials suggested was tense following the lack of progress. “It was a very nice dinner, we had courteous and friendly discussions but we didn’t hide the difficulties between us,” one inidual said. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2020Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

EPARonald WittekCoronavirus cases have been reported by at least 41 schools in Berlin, barely two weeks after the German capital’s 825 schools reopened.Cases are rising across Europe, including in Spain, which registered 66,905 in the past two weeks, resulting in the continent’s highest 14-day infection rate and warnings over the risk of a new wave of deaths.The Berlin experience echoes that in some states in the US, including Georgia, and in Israel, which have recorded clusters tied to schools. According to reports in Berlin, all age groups have been affected, including in elementary schools, high schools and trade schools.Berlin was one of the first places in Germany to reopen its schools after the summer holidays. Children are obliged to wear face coverings in the hallways, during breaks and when they enter the classroom, but they can take them off once they sit in their places and classes begin.Some critics say the measures in Berlin are too relaxed and both students and teachers should be wearing face coverings during lessons.The situation in Spain has drawn a grim warning from the country’s health emergency chief, Fernando Simón, who told reporters: “There should be no confusion: things are not going well. If we continue to allow transmission to rise, even if most cases are mild, we will end up with many in hospital, many in intensive care and many deaths.”More than a quarter of these new infections have been in Madrid, which was at the centre of the country’s crisis in March and April.“We can’t say that the epidemic is out of control at a national level, but there are some specific places where it is,” Mr Simón added, without giving further details.Deaths have also increased across Spain, with 131 dead in the last seven days compared with 12 one month ago. About 1,400 Covid-19 patients were admitted to hospital in the last week, nearly double the figure a week earlier.The rise in cases has prompted officials across Spain to roll out a series of measures, including asking regions to order the closure of brothels, a week after the government shut most nightlife establishments and imposed various other restrictions.France, meanwhile, has recorded another large jump in new coronavirus cases, by far the highest increase since the end of the lockdown in May, leading authorities to order schoolchildren above the age of 11 to wear face coverings when they return to school in just over a week in an attempt to halt the spread of the virus.The new policy marks a toughening of measures as coronavirus infections pick up pace in France, with 4,700 new cases reported on Thursday, a post-lockdown record.“Use of masks will be systematic inside from middle school and not only where there is no social distancing. But outdoors, it’s a local decision,” the education minister, Jean-Michel Blanquer, said in a TV interview late on Thursday.The French health ministry reported 23 additional deaths and 4,586 new infections over the past 24 hours on Friday. There are currently 266 clusters under investigation, and 31 French departments are deemed to be in a situation of “moderate or significant risk”.Health experts say the increase in the number of new cases cannot be explained by the widespread testing being carried out as the rise in new cases is significantly higher than the rise in the number of tests. Hospital and intensive care admissions remain stable, say authorities.-  News and Media Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"Saudi minister says \u0026lsquopeace must be achieved\u0026rsquo on the basis of international agreementsOne found guilty, three acquitted in UN-backed tribunal into killing of former Lebanese PMCourt rules there is no proof Syria was involved in Hariri\u0026rsquos assassinationFour low-ranking members of the Shia Muslim Hezbollah political party are accused of killing the former prime minister and 21 others in a massive bombing in 2005Two countries taking steps towards normal relations with telephone links and flightsPutin suggestion came after Trump said he would trigger a \u0026lsquosnapback\u0026rsquo of sanctionsAs inquiry into Beirut blast gets under way, rescue of country not ruling class urgedThursday\u0026rsquos announcement underlines split in Arab world on Palestinian questionIsraeli right wing furious over decision to drop plans for annexation of parts of the occupied West BankDire condition of Libyan migrant detention centres condemned by human rights groupsCountries to open diplomatic relations for first time and Palestine accuses UAE of selling outAgreement between the two countries described as \u0026lsquoa complete sellout\u0026rsquo of PalestiniansMove seen as victory for Israeli PM Binyamin Netanyahu and will infuriate PalestiniansCountry needs administration that can fight graft, says German ministerWith 200 dead, 6,000 injured and 300,000 destitute, the mood in Beirut is unbendingNames of victims read aloud at demonstration near site of explosion that killed at least 171Prime minister Hassan Diab says blast that killed at least 163 was result of endemic corruptionResignation of government could enable international donors to sideline corrupt administrationPolice fire tear gas near parliament as donors pledge \u0026lsquomajor resources\u0026rsquo after explosionPort officials globally have a tough time preventing the abandonment of ships or seafarersStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4332116.1597668041!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"inside joe biden s race of a lifetime to be us president","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDemocratic presidential candidate Joe Biden: Should he make it to the White House, Biden would have completed the longest marathon in US political history. Photograph: Olivier DoulieryAFP via Getty ImagesIt was late afternoon on February 2nd, the eve of the Iowa caucuses. We were jammed into a high-school gymnasium in Des Moines, the state capital, for Joe Biden’s closing rally.No one thought he would win the primary season’s talismanic opening contest the following day. Nor was he expected to come close to beating Bernie Sanders, the socialist Vermonter, in New Hampshire the next week. Though he was still ahead in the national polls, the 77-year-old former vice-president was treated as yesterday’s news.A crowd of several hundred was waiting unexpectantly. Biden entered roughly half an hour late, accompanied by a phalanx of retired politicians: John Kerry (76), the former secretary of state Chris Dodd (75), the retired senator from Connecticut Tom Vilsack (69), former governor of Iowa and Harold Schaitberger (73), president of the International Association of Firefighters.The oxygen seemed to drain from the room. As Biden’s surrogates spoke one after the other, the air got progressively thinner. By the time the candidate got up to speak, it was positively embalmed. “This is like a wake,” joked one veteran television anchor. Biden’s low-key soliloquy did little to lift the energy.Such are the limits of conventional wisdom. Twenty-seven days later, Biden grabbed the Democratic mantle after sweeping the South Carolina primary. With the notable exception of Sanders, who fought on for another five weeks, most of the rest of the field dropped out and endorsed him. It was a breathtaking twist.With hindsight, Biden officials say they always knew he would be the Democratic nominee. They were playing the long game. “We made a decision from the start not to listen to the loudest voices on Twitter,” says Stef Feldman, Biden’s policy director. That was not how many sounded at the time. When I asked a Biden staffer in Des Moines about the campaign’s mood, he used the TV anchor’s same funereal analogy.Who could blame them? Biden’s long history of running for the White House offered no cause for hope. Over a  of more than 32 years, he had not won a single primary. In 1987, he crashed out months before the voting began, having been accused of plagiarising a speech by Neil Kinnock, leader of the British Labour party.In 2008, he quit after having won just 0.9 per cent of the Iowa caucus vote. “At that point, most people thought his presidential career was over,” says Shailagh Murray, then a journalist with the Washington Post, who went on to become Biden’s deputy chief of staff. He had at least another 12 years to go. Nobody that night imagined that Barack Obama, winner of the Iowa caucus, would go on to pick Biden as his ­running mate.Ceremonial presidentThe vicissitudes of Biden’s 50 years in politics ought to make anyone sceptical of forecasts for this November. In the absence of time machines, we can only go by the numbers. Both the betting markets (about two to one in Biden’s favour) and the polls (an average eight-percentage-point lead over Donald Trump) suggest Biden will be America’s 46th president.What manner of president would he make? Half of Washington claims to know the man well. At a year above the median US male’s life expectancy, many expect him to be a ceremonial president. Even Biden’s close friends admit his energy and power of recall are not what they were.His would be a restorationist presidency – an erasure of what he is fond of describing as the Trumpian “aberration”. Others, notably Trump, depict him as a geriatric prisoner of the Democratic Party’s left. Most agree that whatever his agenda, and whatever the time of day, he would probably still talk too much.The word “logorrhea” (a tendency to extreme loquacity) has recently come into fashion. Biden’s campaign is keen to emphasise he would not, like Trump, be the “Twitterer-in-chief”.Those who know him the best – many of whom spoke to me for this profile – are in little doubt about the character he would bring to the presidency. Their Biden may stray too readily into schmaltz. But his empathy for people is real. In this pandemic-blighted election year, that quality could count for a lot.“Biden is the same guy I first met in 1969 – he was full of piss and vinegar,” says Louis Susman, a Chicago-based investor and former ambassador to the UK. “He doesn’t suffer from inner demons, he doesn’t bear grudges and he loves being around people.”Should he make it to the White House, Biden would have completed the longest marathon in US political history. No other serious figure has tried this long to make it over the finishing line in recent history.A majority of Americans were not born when Biden first entered national politics. At 30, he was the fifth youngest senator in the country’s history after he won office in 1972. Biden’s 48-year political career is older than John F Kennedy, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama when they were elected.Yet he sounds remarkably similar today to the ambitious, blue-collar Irish-American that he was then. Staffers tried and failed to get him to avoid using words such as “record player” during the 2020 primaries. Calling someone a “horse’s ass” is no longer thought to be cutting. In an interview with Kitty Kelley in 1974, Biden worried about being seen as a “gay young bachelor” around Washington – by which he meant “happy”, not “LGBTQ”.So popular are Biden’s anachronisms that there is even a “Biden insult bot” – a Twitter algorithm – to which fans can turn. “You got something stuck in your craw, you milk-swillin’ circus peanut,” reads one tweet. “Shut your piehole, you hood-winked britch soiler,” reads another.‘Amtrak Joe’Most American voters already know of the ­tragedy that struck Biden in his early career. A few weeks after he was elected to the Senate, he lost his wife Neilia and one-year-old daughter, Naomi, in a car crash while they were Christmas shopping in Delaware, his home state.His sons, Beau, aged three, and Hunter, aged two, survived but were hospitalised with severe injuries. Most people would have disintegrated. Biden considered not taking his Senate seat. In the end, he was persuaded to be sworn in at the hospital beside one of his sons. He said he could only continue in politics if he saw his kids every morning and night.Thus was born “Amtrak Joe” – the senator who took the 90-minute journey each evening from Washington to Wilmington to say goodnight to his sons. He commuted until 2008, long after the boys had grown up. Subtracting a tenth of nights for other travel, and nearly half the year for recess and weekends, I calculate that Biden spent at least 21,000 hours – or three years of his life – on that train.“He knew the names of every conductor and they all loved him,” says Paul Laudicina, Biden’s legislative director between 1977 and 1982. “Often, he would still be talking when he boarded, and I would go to Wilmington with him and then cross the platform and come straight back.”In the 1974 Kelley interview, the famously acerbic journalist said Biden “reeks of decency”. He nevertheless managed to sound almost Trumpian about his deceased wife. “Let me show you my favourite picture of her,” he says, holding up a snapshot of Neilia in a bikini. “She had the best body of any woman I ever saw. She looks better than a Playboy bunny, doesn’t she?” Kelley described his office as a shrine to Neilia.Biden recently conceded that he has been too invasive of women’s personal space – “handsiness” has also entered the DC lexicon. Unlike some of his contemporaries, however, he has not been dogged by rumours of infidelity. A former Senate staffer, Tara Reade, accused him earlier this year of sexually assaulting her in a corridor in 1993. Biden denies it and her story has been criticised as inconsistent.In 1977 Biden married Jill Tracy Jacobs, a teacher based in Wilmington. On their first date he dressed in a jacket. When he dropped her back home he shook her hand. According to What it Takes, the ­celebrated 1988 campaign book by the late ­Richard Ben Cramer, Jill said she could not believe such men still existed. “Jill is Biden’s least appreciated strength,” says Susman, who often hosted the Bidens for Thanksgiving in his Nantucket home.Much of Biden’s sense of gravity comes from her. Even when her husband was vice-president, Jill Biden continued to teach every day at a community college in Northern Virginia. When he left office in 2017, the Bidens’ net worth was less than $500,000. They still hadn’t paid off the mortgage on their Wilmington home.Irish-Catholic and handsomeUntil he was rescued from near-certain genteel decline by Obama, Biden was defined by his disastrous 1988 presidential bid. Most of the people who helped him on that jinxed quest, including Ted Kaufman, his long-running chief of staff, Michael Donilon, his chief strategist today, and Donilon’s brother Tom, Biden’s foreign-policy adviser, are still around him.They are mostly Irish-American and very tight-knit. Cathy Russell, Tom Donilon’s wife, was Jill Biden’s chief of staff when she was “second lady”. Her husband is tipped as a possible secretary of state. Kaufman is running Biden’s presidential transition – that long and rickety bridge between victory and inauguration.In the 1988 campaign, Biden tried to present himself as the new John F Kennedy – young, Irish-Catholic and handsome. It never quite took hold. Then he saw a video of Kinnock’s soaring oratory – “Why am I the first Kinnock in a thousand generations to be able to get to university?” That was the middle-class poetry Biden had been lacking – the story of how the sons and daughters of coal miners had been lifted up by the welfare state, Britain’s version of the New Deal.“He grabbed that tape and took it home he inhaled the thing,” wrote Cramer. “It was like when Barbra Streisand came on the radio – Kinnock was singing Joe’s song.” For the most part, Biden credited Kinnock’s words. But the rival Michael Dukakis campaign found one tape where Biden had not. They leaked it.Suddenly, Biden was inundated with calls asking whether his grandfather had been a coal miner (none of his forebears had been). “It looked like Joe didn’t just steal the words, it looked like he ripped off Kinnock’s life,” Cramer wrote. A few months after dropping out, Biden had a near-fatal ­aneurysm. Then another. He was given a 50-50 chance of ­surviving the first nine-hour operation.“Joe wouldn’t be alive today if he had still been running for president,” says Kaufman. “He wouldn’t have had the time to get his headaches checked out.” Or, as Biden said when he emerged from the anaesthetic: “Now I know why the campaign ended like it did.” For what it’s worth, Kinnock’s Labour Party lost the election too.Emotional antennaeBiden’s 2008 loss left less of a mark on him, partly because he became vice-president less than a year later. “How could you begrudge losing to Barack Obama?” says Murray. “Obama was like The Beatles.”The campaign Biden still regrets was the one that he didn’t fight in 2016. His reluctance stemmed from another tragedy, the death in 2015 of his son Beau from brain cancer. But he had little encouragement from Obama, who had already committed to backing Hillary Clinton. Biden’s internal polls show that he would have beaten Trump. But he had little chance of wresting the crown from Clinton, whose machine he could not hope to match.In his memoir Promise Me, Dad, named after Beau’s request that his father stay in politics, Biden recounts his anger following a Politico story that he was exploiting his son’s death for electoral purposes. “It exceeded even my worst expectations of what the opposition was going to be like,” he wrote. In truth, he could not discuss running without breaking down. “He would literally start to cry every time we raised the subject,” says a Biden ­confidante.In another cycle, Biden’s lachrymosity might have been an albatross. During coronavirus, his emotional antennae look like a virtue. More than 165,000 Americans have now died in the pandemic. That toll is likely to be approaching a quarter of a million by early November.Trump’s inability to express condolences for America’s grieving families could not be further apart from Biden’s. In 2016, anger was the dominant political emotion. In 2020, it feels more like sadness. “If Trump were matter, then Biden is anti-matter – their characters are opposites,” says Laurence Tribe, a Harvard law professor who has been advising Biden on constitutional matters since the mid-1980s.When Biden was vice-president, Norm Ornstein, a veteran Congressional watcher, lost his son in a tragic accident. “The moment he heard, Biden telephoned and spent an hour on the phone with me and my wife, talking us through it,” says ­Ornstein. “The next day I received a handwritten letter of condolence from him. There is nothing fake about his sympathy. He feels it deeply.”Andrew Yang, the maverick hit of the Democratic primaries, says: “When most people hadn’t figured out who I was, Joe took me aside and was very gracious and friendly. This was just as true when things were going badly for him – he’s always steady and good-natured, in public and in private.”‘Shoot. Me. Now’Some in Biden’s world admit they have one or two concerns about the election and beyond. Chief of these is his tendency to make gaffes. In that sense, the lockdown has a silver lining: there is no campaign trail to avoid. Zoom is easier to manage.When Obama was elected to the US Senate in 2004, Biden invited him to join the foreign relations committee, of which he was chairman. Having listened to a trademark Biden disquisition, Obama scribbled a note and handed it to a staffer. It read: “Shoot. Me. Now.”When the two men were discussing how they would handle their White House relationship, Obama said: “I want your advice Joe, I just want it in 10-minute, not 60-minute, increments.” For the most part, Biden complied.Sometimes, he could not help himself. The term “Bidenism” – self-inflicted public humiliation – has long been in currency. “Stand up Chuck, let ’em see ya,” Biden once said to a Missouri state senator in a wheelchair. “Folks, I can tell you, I’ve known eight presidents, three of them intimately,” he said in praise of Obama, adding: “I promise you, the president has a big stick, I promise you,” in a mangled rendition of Theodore Roosevelt’s dictum about speaking softly and carrying a big stick.Fear of such miscues saw the Obama camp “quarantine” Biden for most of the 2012 re-election campaign. This year’s actual quarantine could thus be helpful.Many in Biden world are betting that his choice of Kamala Harris as running mate will immunise him against a record of racial gaffes. Earlier this year, Biden apologised after saying that “you ain’t black” if you would consider voting against him. As a mixed-race American of Indian and Jamaican heritage, the Harris pick will buy Biden more protection.Given Biden’s age, she is far likelier than most running mates to become president. As Biden discovered in the primaries, she also knows how to throw a punch.It is hard to find anyone in Biden’s circle who is losing sleep over three debates with Trump later this year. As Biden showed in 2008 with Sarah Palin and in 2012 with Paul Ryan – the Republican running mates of John McCain and Mitt Romney – he is a surprisingly taut debater.Trump, meanwhile, seems to be afflicted with his own severe dose of logorrhea. His recent boast in a Fox News interview that he recalled five words in order in a cognitive test was greeted with mockery. “I have two words for you,” says a senior adviser, when I ask about Biden’s age and prolixity: “Donald Trump. ”Biden’s peopleNor is the campaign worried about Twitter. When I asked two Biden officials whether he composed his own tweets, or would know how to send one, I got an unexpectedly constipated response: “No one has ever asked us that.” It turns out that Biden does not physically send his own tweets but is involved with their substance.Their second concern is ageing. At 74, Trump is only a smidgen younger than Biden. The difference with Trump is the people with whom Biden would surround himself. Chief among these is Ron Klain, a long-standing Biden aide who is likely to be White House chief of staff. Tony Blinken would probably be his national security adviser.Other top-job contenders would include Tom Donilon and Susan Rice (successive national security advisers to Obama), Kurt Campbell (who ran Asia policy for Obama), Jake Sullivan (who leads Biden’s campaign policy), Nick Burns, a former under secretary of state, and Bill Burns (no relation), a former deputy secretary of state. Michèle Flournoy, a former under secretary of defence, is tipped as a likely Pentagon chief.One adviser predicted that Biden would choose Romney, the Republican senator from Utah, as his secretary of state. That would annoy Vladimir Putin’s Russia, whom Romney described as America’s “number one geopolitical foe”. It would also upset most Democrats for very different reasons.Either way, the contrast between Biden’s friends and the parade of often bizarre cameos that have staffed the Trump administration is glaring. The current president is now on his fourth chief of staff and sixth national security adviser. By contrast, most of Biden’s coterie have known him for decades.“What leaps out about Biden’s people is their competence,” says John Podesta, a senior official in both the Clinton and Obama White Houses. “Neither he nor his team need training wheels.”There are also lingering worries about Hunter Biden, who has long been a source of concern for his father. “Joe has a total blind spot about Hunter,” says a close family friend.Hunter was discharged from the US Navy because he tested positive for cocaine. He launched various business ventures while his father was vice-president. He was accused of monetising the Biden name and subsequently got a seat on the board of a Ukrainian gas company.Trump’s attempts to extort Ukraine to supply Biden opposition research resulted in his impeachment last year (though he was acquitted by the Senate). “The campaign just has to keep Hunter out of the picture,” says the friend.Radical platformWhat would Biden actually do in office? Tackling the pandemic would be the first, second and third priority of any incoming president. Little can happen while the US economy is under semi-­permanent lockdown.Beyond that his economic platform is radical by the standards of any recent Democratic president, including Obama. “We would have the largest mobilisation of investments since world war two,” says Feldman. “We would start by putting pandemic logistics and supply on a war footing.”Some people compare the gargantuan challenges of today to 1932, when Franklin D Roosevelt won the election in the middle of the Great Depression. In spite of running a fairly bland campaign, FDR then embarked on a streak of “bold, persistent experimentation” that would remake America.But the differences are more interesting. For all its ravages, coronavirus is not as intractable as the Great Depression. By next January, the world should be closer to having a vaccine. Biden would also be fulfilling the first rule of any job – always follow an under-performer.He could achieve a lot in his first 100 days simply by covering the basics, such as launching a national coronavirus plan, shunning Twitter and not insulting foreign leaders. “If you have an American president at foreign summits eating with his mouth closed and not throwing cutlery around, the world will give him a standing ovation,” says one adviser and friend.Low-hanging foreign-policy fruit that Biden would pluck in his opening days include rejoining the World Health Organisation, the Paris agreement on climate change and the Iran nuclear deal, says Jake Sullivan. He would also convene a global summit to tackle Covid-19.Domestic steps would include stopping work on the US-Mexico border wall (such as it is), setting up a daily coronavirus briefing led by Dr Anthony Fauci or Ron Klain (who led Obama’s Ebola team) and picking an attorney general who would embrace planks of Black Lives Matter’s criminal-justice reform agenda.In his dealings both with Republicans and foreign leaders, Biden would place great stock in personal chemistry. Enjoying the company of people is one area where Biden is as different to Obama as he is to Trump. “The thing that Biden most likes is what Obama liked the least – the ­personal stuff,” says Podesta. Nick Burns says Biden revels in the “constant gardening” of diplomacy – talking frequently to his counterparts.Wishful thinkingSceptics point out that today’s Republican Party is unrecognisable to the one with which Biden grew up. Should he emerge intact from transition with a paranoid Trump, the chances of the defeated party working with him will be slim. Woke nativism will prove a more durable pathogen than Covid-19.Moreover, Biden’s global honeymoon would be unlikely to last long. Most people view his musings about restoring the status quo ante – going back to the world before Trump – as wishful thinking, not that geopolitical trends were particularly stable during the Obama years.China looms far larger today than it did in 2016. Biden’s favourite European, Angela Merkel, Germany’s chancellor, is due to retire by next year. And Biden will neither be inclined – nor likely in a position – to offer Britain’s Boris Johnson the US-UK trade deal he craves.Tony Blinken, Biden’s senior foreign policy adviser, says Biden’s scepticism about Obama’s ineffectual Afghanistan surge looks better and better in hindsight. “I respect Gates tremendously but he just wanted approval for his Afghanistan plan and Biden disagreed,” he says. Biden was in favour of US intervention in Bosnia in 1995, he adds, to convey that Biden is not some ­inveterate peacenik.But Biden’s biggest migraine would probably be at home. In the coming weeks, Trump is likely to make a lot of Biden’s “socialist” agenda – the hundreds of billions he has pledged to spend on everything from college education to rural broadband.Should Biden follow Obama’s example and pick Wall Street-friendly economic advisers, the left’s distrust would soon resurface. Last week, Lawrence Summers, Obama’s chief economic adviser and Bill Clinton’s Treasury secretary, ruled out joining a Biden administration. “My time in government is behind me,” he told the Aspen Security Forum.Happy passengerTo many people’s surprise, the left has largely fallen into line. Bernie Sanders dropped nearly all his most-cherished demands to agree a joint platform with Biden. This is in stark contrast to Sanders’s stand-offish – and simmeringly uneasy – ceasefire with Hillary Clinton in 2016.An estimated one-fifth of Sanders’s supporters in 2016 either sat on their hands or voted for Trump. Biden has not adopted a universal basic income, Medicare for all or a wealth tax – Sanders’s top three priorities.Yet the Vermont senator seems to be a happy passenger on Amtrak Joe’s train. Their policies may differ but their values are not miles apart. “Biden believes that his ultimate calling is to make life better for the middle class,” says Jared Bernstein, an economic adviser. “His watchword is ‘dignity.’” Ted Kaufman adds: “Biden and Bernie may disagree ideologically but they respect each other’s integrity.”Might such charms work on Republicans? I spoke to many people in Biden’s world and none thought the Republican leopard was likely to change its spots. One said: “Joe is still a romantic about the Senate. He will have to learn the hard way.”The omens for old-fashioned Biden-style bipartisanship are not cheerful. Yet there is an improbability to Biden’s odyssey that should give anyone pause. The lyrics may be corny. The music is not. It is an odd mix of Shakespearean tragedy and Shakespearean comedy.I have heard people describe Biden as the embodiment of America’s can-do spirit. Shailagh Murray called him a “spiritual optimist”. A campaign official talked of his “strategic empathy”. I have also heard people call Biden a “clown”, including a former Obama official.Biden loves to talk of when “the man meets the moment”. The joke is that he has said this about himself every time he has run for office. There has never been a moment where Biden does not think he should be residing in the White House.But like a stopped clock, perhaps this time he is right. “Life is about choices, right?” says a former senior CIA official who has interacted with Biden over more than three decades. “Biden or Trump?” He admitted that he occasionally saw Biden as a “mediocre” politician. But he added that Biden always struck him as fundamentally decent, which sounds like a subversive quality in today’s Washington.“Even if you thought that Biden was mediocre,” he continued, “you would take mediocre over catastrophic every time.”– Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2020Full coverage of the US presidential election 2020Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"covid 19 can survive frozen meat fish three weeks study finds","story":"Covid-19 can survive on frozen meat and fish for up to three weeks, a study has found, as scientists warn that contaminated food may cause outbreaks.Inidual pieces of salmon, chicken and pork from supermarkets in Singapore were sliced into cubes then a sample of the virus was added to them.The meat and fish was stored in conditions which simulate those used to transport food between countries - 4C (standard refrigeration temperature) and minus 20C (standard freezing temperature). Scientists found that infectious Covid-19 was still present on the samples after 21 days.Importation of contaminated food and food packaging is a feasible source for such outbreaks and a source of clusters within existing outbreaks.While it can be confidently argued that transmission via contaminated food is not a major infection route, the potential for movement of contaminated items to a region with no Covid-19 and initiate an outbreak is an important hypothesis.An infected food handler has the potential to become an index case of a new outbreak. The international food market is massive and even a very unlikely event could be expected to occur from time to time.Frequent hand washing and thorough cleaning of equipment at food processing sites is recommended by the researchers to reduce the chance of Covid-19 spreading this way.Prof James Wood, head of the Veterinary Medicine department at the University of Cambridge, told The Sunday : “The authors discuss, very sensibly, how it is important that factory workers must be incentivised not to go to work when symptomatic or in contact with Covid-19 cases.”  The study, which is yet to be peer reviewed, was published on the bioRxiv website here.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"new zealands lust lockdown latest example vapid political virtue","story":"Progressive mythology always demands a socialist valhalla a nation to be idealised and held as up an inspiration. For years, Scandinavia, and particularly Sweden, played this role. The stereotype was never entirely accurate Scandinavian social democracy is a far cry from full-throated socialism, yet it remained influential.In the face of the pandemic, however, the tables have turned now it is the libertarian Right who are lining up to applaud Swedish exceptionalism, while progressives liken their controversial strategy to a form of eugenics. With Sweden consigned to the naughty step, the Left needs a new country to fetishise, and they have alighted on New Zealand.This was underway long before the virus arrived, thanks to NZ’s intoxicating combination of centre-left politics and a charismatic, young and importantly, female, leader: Jacinda Ardern. Her decisive leadership following the mass shooting in Christchurch propelled the New Zealand PM to global prominence, and she has since enjoyed fawning media coverage surpassing even the high water-mark of Trudeau-mania.The Left applauded NZ’s “wellbeing budget”, emphasising citizens’ happiness over GDP growth, and cheered when Ardern brought her baby into the UN assembly hall. Their zero-tolerance approach to Covid-19 has been especially influential. A group of weak-minded MPs and peers are currently urging our own Government to pursue a similar aim of total eradication.We should be under no illusion - this is no model for New Zealand to follow, let alone a sophisticated global economy like ours. NZ may have contained the virus, for now at least, registering the lowest mortality rates in the OECD, but it has taken genuinely draconian policies and great economic pain to get there. The Ardern administration is eliminating rights on a scale more reminiscent of authoritarian China than a Western liberal democracy.Last week, the whole of Auckland was sent into lockdown after the government announced a grand total of four new cases in the capital. GDP has taken its biggest slide in three decades. A total ban on foreign arrivals has endured for months, with catastrophic results for tourism, directly employing 8.4 per cent of the workforce. New Zealanders returning from abroad must pay for the privilege of isolating in military-guarded facilities, to the tune of more than £1,500 per head. One man recently received a six-week jail sentence for hugging a friend quarantining in a detention centre.The NZ experience should serve as a cautionary tale about the normalisation of overreach. Though the country has not recorded a single covid death since May, the government decided to postpone the Autumn elections following the small-scale outbreak this month. Progressives, so alert to the subversion of democracy in the USA, had little to say about this extraordinary over-reaction.An elimination strategy has made them hostages to fortune with precedence established, it will be politically toxic to change course. Ardern has ridden high in the polls so far, but if such disruption continues, public appetite for keeping the country virus-free at any cost will surely wane, and the recent outbreak, despite NZ’s geographic isolation and its draconian policy response, suggests no country can postpone the inevitable.The implications of New Zealand’s autarchy go beyond its shores as well. Tourism accounts for a third of jobs in Fiji, Palau and Vanuatu and two thirds of their visitors come from Australia and New Zealand. Yet amid mounting poverty and unemployment, island leaders’ pleadings for air bridges seem barely to have registered with an administration myopically focused on elimination. In seeking to be kind, the Ardern administration has ended up being very cruel indeed.Enthusiasts for this model imply that elimination, like the happiness budget, and like Ardern herself, puts people above the callous vicissitudes of the balance sheet. As we are increasingly finding, the two cannot be so easily disentangled. Excessively harsh lockdowns have become a form of international virtue-signalling something only wealthy nations can afford, but which promises catastrophe for the world’s poorest.Before the recent spike, commentators lauded Ardern as being “on course to eradicate the virus completely.” The ambition was childish and hubristic in the extreme. Until the planet reaches a state of elimination, New Zealand will have to stay in indefinite isolation, with domestic lock-downs a likely fixture of life, perhaps for years to come. The economy cannot bear this for long. Nor can the people.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"parents tricked buying sugary childrens snacks promoted healthy","story":"Parents are finding it increasingly difficult to refuse children\u0027s requests for sugary snacks that are misleadingly promoted as healthy, campaigners have said.Anti-sugar groups have accused manufacturers and retailers of deliberately targeting sugary products at children by marketing them as fruit-based health snacks. They have called on the Government to crack down on these products as part of its new anti-obesity drive to get Britain fit.Groups such as Action on Sugar and the Early Years Foundation have warned that the National Food Strategy risks is being undermined by the sale of snacks and sweets such as Percy Pig and Bear Pure Fruit Yoyos, which they say are full of harmful sugar.The groups spoke out following the publication of the strategy, which calls for free school meals for an additional 1.5 million children in a household on Universal Credit, and for poorer youngsters to be fed during the school holidays.The 110-page report – the first independent review of UK food policy for 75 years – said obesity was a national emergency we can no longer afford to ignore and that the coronavirus pandemic had given a new urgency to the slow-motion disaster of the British diet.Health campaigners said parents who want to do the best for their children are being tricked into buying fruit-based snacks that are in fact high in sugar.Holly Gabriel, a nutritionist at Action on Sugar, told The : It is highly concerning that many people, especially parents, are often tricked into choosing these fruit-based snacks thinking they are choosing healthier products, only to find these items are high in free sugars, and with minimal nutritional value. Claims on packs such as \u0027No added colours\u0027 and \u0027one of your five a day\u0027 mislead parents that these are a suitable snack, with many stating: \u0027Great for kids.\u0027 Whilst it should be mandatory for these products to be included in reformulation programmes, it is essential that the upcoming labelling reviews in the UK results in changes to these practises.Along with the many other health impacts of excessive free sugar consumption, these snacks are contributing to tooth decay in children and should be classed as confectionary and not healthy snacks.As well as Percy Pig sweets, sold by M\u0026ampS, Action on Sugar and the Dental Wellness Trust also highlighted a number of other supposedly healthy snacks which they described as harmful. These include Graze Super Snackers Strawberry, Fruit Bowl Yogurt Raisins and Bear Pure Fruit Yoyos Strawberry, which they say are high in sugar.Graze is promoted as high in fibre. Real fruit. No artificial sweeteners, colours, flavours or preservatives. These bars have 50 per cent less sugar than the average cereal bar and with a recipe made with help from kids. Less sugar, top taste.Fruit Bowl\u0027s Yogurt Raisins are marketed as ideal as a snack. Irresistible, intensely fruity, and incredibly moreish. Fruit made fun. Yummy, yummy yogurt coated raisins.June O\u0027Sullivan, the CEO of the London Early Years Foundation, said: It\u0027s already a struggle for parents to fully understand what is \u0027healthy\u0027 without food manufacturers confusing matters further with misleading claims and snacks packed full of sugar which are marketed heavily towards children.At a time when nearly 40 per cent of all London\u0027s children are overweight or affected by obesity, and the highest rates occur in the areas of greatest deprivation, this is highly irresponsible behaviour.Dr Saul Konviser, of the Dental Wellness Trust, said: Added sugar has found its way into almost all food, and the use of sugar as a means to calm, entertain, or reward children has become normalised, whereas in fact it does quite the opposite and so sugar should be an occasional treat.Aside from the well-known health problems of obesity and diabetes, the widespread availability of sugar leads to much toothache and suffering, not just in children but in adults too.Graze defended its Super Snackers range as delicious wholegrain oat bars that are all under 100 kcals with 50 per cent less sugar than the average cereal bar.A spokesman said: All three recipes contain less than 3g sugar per bar.  The reason we add some sugar is not only to create great tasting products but it\u0027s also really important for binding and texture in baked goods. As a brand we strongly believe \u0027natural\u0027 is the best policy when it comes to health and when it comes to sugar. We would never permit any artificial sweeteners in any of our products to achieve lower sugar levels, like some other brands do.Golden syrup and liquid sugar are types of sucrose sugar, much like cane sugar, and help us give our cereal bars a great taste and texture. We also add dried fruit into the mix for natural sweetness. We\u0027ve managed lower sugar content in our kids\u0027 product by replacing sugar with naturally sweet chicory root fibre.We also want to be clear that we do not advertise or promote these products to children, in accordance with the Unilever principles on marketing to children.Fruit Bowl said: Fruit Bowl Yogurt Raisins are clearly positioned differently in the market to Fruit Bowl\u0027s wider range, which the brand communicates through the packaging design and the language on pack.  Yogurt Raisins are clearly marked as a \u0027yummy treat\u0027 on front of pack, rather than an everyday snack. While Fruit Bowl Yogurt Raisins contain real fruit and no added colours or flavours, we make no claims such as high fibre or one of a child\u0027s five a day on this range.Henry Dimbleby, the founder of the Leon restaurant chain and author of the Government\u0027s National Food Strategy, took particular aim at M\u0026ampS for its Percy Pig sweets, marketed as containing all natural fruit juice and sold at child- height in stores despite the first four ingredients listed being forms of sugar, such as fructose syrup and glucose-fructose syrup.Mr Dimbleby said part of the problem was that well-meaning parents were giving children unhealthy snacks such as raisins which were clothed in a veneer of goodness and actually may be no better for you than a Mars Bar.An M\u0026ampS spokesman said: All our products have clear labelling so that customers can make informed choices about what they buy. All our Percy Pigs are made with natural fruit juices and no artificial colours or flavourings, and last year we also introduced a range of Percy Pigs with one third less sugar.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/03/19/15/gettyimages-597561960.jpg  width= 1460  height= 1095  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/03/19/15/gettyimages-597561960.jpg","title":"britney spears father jamie conservatorship extended","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.Spears ‘strongly opposes’ father’s position as conservatorBritney Spears’ father Jamie will retain control of her personal life, career and estate, despite the singer having requested that he be removed as her conservator.Spears’ conservatorship has been extended until at least February 2021, a judge determined in a Los Angeles court on Wednesday (19 August).Spears’ father has been her conservator for 12 years. Conservatorship is when a  or protector is appointed by a court to manage the life of someone due to physical or mental limitations. Spears’ conservatorship was put in place in 2008 after she suffered a public breakdown in 2007.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesOn Monday (17 August), Spears’ lawyers had stated that the singer is “strongly opposed” to having her father as her conservator.The conservatorship has been the subject of widespread online protests this year.The #FreeBritney movement was launched by fans who believe Spears is “trapped”, and one petition, with more than 100,000 signatures lobbying for Spears’ freedom, claims: “Her father doesn’t allow her to drive, all of her calls \u0026amp messages are monitored, she’s not allowed to vote, hang with anyone or spend her money without permission. And if she breaks a ‘rule’ he threatens to have her kids taken away.”Earlier this month, Jamie called the #FreeBritney campaign “a joke” and said he is tired of rumours that she is being exploited.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The Home Office says it provides successful applicants with only a digital copy of their status to ensure they can “constantly access proof of their status” and that it is in keeping with the “shift towards digital status in all areas of life”.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHowever, charities warn that this will exclude people who are not digitally literate and that some agencies – such as landlords, employers and border officials – may continue to demand physical proof of status, which would leave millions of people cut off from their fundamental rights such as access to employment, healthcare and housing.A review into the scheme by the Government Digital Service in 2018 found the digital-only system would cause low digital users “a lot of issues”, with some unlikely to be able to use the online service “at all”. It said the Home Office’s drive to convert more services to digital and remove their physical counterparts needed “careful consideration”, warning that “digital by default doesn’t mean 100 per cent digital”.Nicoletta Peddis, 34, an Italian national who has lived in the UK for 12 years, faced a week-long delay in the process of renting a new property in York with her partner last year because the letting agent insisted that they show physical proof of their UK residency. The agent said it had “no idea” what EU settled status was when she explained that it was digital-only.“In the end, she managed to check it online, but I’m worried this might cause more problems down the line. It’s a signal of how complicated things could get next year.”She added: “The letting market in York is crazy. I thought, if someone else had applied who didn’t have this problem, they might just go with them rather than us, just because it’s easier and you don’t have to go through all these checks.“It would be so much easier if they provided a document. Things like the Windrush scandal make you think this is not going to go down well.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I said I was an EU citizen and she said ‘but Brexit’. I said I had EU settled status and tried to explain that there was a way to check it online.“She was getting more and more confused. It was stressful, I thought I was going to miss my flight. And then eventually, she let me through.”Without physical proof of our status, EU citizens like me live in fearThe 24-year-old said she would prefer to have a physical document, particularly when travelling: “I think people in a lot of countries are aware of Brexit but they don’t know when it’s happening, what it means and how it works. It would be so much easier if there was some kind of card or stamp in my passport that I could show to avoid these kinds of conversations.“The whole idea of records only being kept online doesn’t sit well with me, especially after the Windrush scandal.”Another Lithuanian national, who has been in the UK for 13 years, and asked not to be named, was prevented from visiting her mother in Russia because the Russian embassy refused to access the link to her EU settled status online.The 40-year-old woman, who works as a private tour guide, said: “I took a screen grab and they didn’t accept it. They said other EU nationals had shown them their physical residency permit. I told them I didn’t have any paper documents. I tried to explain how it works but they said no, we can’t click on anything. They said they needed a paper proof of residency.“It’s very disappointing because the last time I saw my mother was last September. She’s 70 and she lives on her own. I’m very angry and frustrated. I don’t deserve this, I haven’t done anything wrong, I have every right to be here, but now all of a sudden I feel like I have no rights.“There should be physical proof – ID cards or something. It can’t go on like this, how many more problems will I and others face in the future?”Maike Bohn, co-founder of the3million campaign group, warned that these cases were “only the tip of the iceberg”.“From next year, millions of EU citizens who are doing key work in their communities, in fields, warehouses and offices, will be treated differently from the rest of UK residents. They will have no tangible proof of their hard-earned right to live and work in the UK,” she said.EU nationals who cannot prove ‘settled status’ denied basic rightsGovernment denies Verhofstadt claim over EU citizens’ right to remainEU nationals who cannot prove ‘settled status’ denied basic rights“EU citizens will face a crisis that is entirely preventable: being unable to open a bank account if the website is down, or lose out on a job because there was no phone signal and the next person in line had a physical card to prove their right to work there and then.“While the world inevitably becomes more digital, we need to make sure that those who struggle or face problems do not fall through the cracks in the meantime. The government should give EU citizens physical proof of their right to live and work in the UK.”Ollie Persey, a barrister at the Public Law Project, said the charity was concerned about the impact of digital-only status for disadvantaged groups, including elderly people who are not digitally literate and people who cannot access their digital status because of their disability.Describing a recent case in which the charity was asked to assist a client whose visual impairment meant that he couldn’t read screens, Mr Persey added: “Without physical documentation, people in this situation will face real difficulties in proving their immigration status next year.”  Sonia Lenegan, legal director at the Immigration Law Practitioners’ Association, said: “From the outset of the EU settlement scheme, countless organisations and iniduals have raised concerns about a ‘digital only’ status. “Iniduals are already experiencing problems within the UK as a result of this. It is unclear what steps have been taken to ensure that border officials in other countries understand what the digital status is, but this is another example of the problems caused by the lack of a physical document.”A Home Office spokesperson said: “EU citizens are our friends and neighbours and we want them to stay – which is why we are delighted that there have been more than 3.5 million grants of status under the scheme.“In the long term, physical documents expire, become invalid, or can be lost, stolen or tampered with. A digital status ensures that EU citizens who are granted status in the UK can constantly access proof of their status, which is just as valid as a physical one.“All areas of life are seeing a shift towards digital status, from banking to transport – it is only logical that borders and immigration embrace technology and continue with this shift.“EU citizens can, however, continue to use their passport or national identity card to evidence their status in the UK until 30 June 2021.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

At a time when Londoners from all walks of life are struggling due to the impact of coronavirus, the importance of love and care from others has been magnified tenfold.The phrase comes from a work made by the artist Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith – one of several fantastic lots in an auction kicking off today at sothebys to support The Independent’s Help the Hungry appeal.Over the past four months we have raised more than £7.5m for food redistribution charity The Felix Project – a cause for which we have pledged to raise £10m as well as to open central London’s largest community kitchen.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe auction is an opportunity to get your hands on works by some amazing artists – more likely to be seen on the walls of a museum than your living room. They can also be viewed at Sotheby’s, 34-35 New Bond Street.Ceramic has been a recurring motif for Ai Weiwei (a 1995 series of photographs showed him dropping a Han dynasty urn) and he has often used porcelain, for centuries a secret formula known only to Chinese makers. Flowers, too, are significant – when his passport was taken Ai put a bunch of fresh flowers in a bike basket outside his studio every day until he was able to travel freely. This small plate holds a great deal of meaning.Yinka Shonibare deconstructions of icons of western power couldn’t be more current. This elegant woodcut print, using vivid Batik textiles, transposes animal masks from Mali onto the faces of English aristocratic figures enriched off the back of colonisation and slavery. The patterns of textiles overlay the repeating patterns of power and show how history’s long fingers reach into our present.Unfailingly optimistic, Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s work is always a call to care. He’s known for his colourful and impassioned but peaceful slogans (“Make Art Not War” seems like a good standard to live by) and his advocacy of art as a tool for education and understanding. We Have Only Got Each Other quotes his late mother, the artist Deirdre Borlase, spoken in response to the isions revealed during the Brexit campaign — but its universal meaning is clear.I’m a sucker for a good drawing – I’ve always felt that even at 500-odd years distance, it’s the form that brings you closest to an artist the sweep of a human hand that has just left the page. After many years of deeply mining her own emotions and experiences in her work, Emin is an artist at the height of her powers. Her raw, almost agonisingly expressive draughtsmanship gets me every time and this little sketch nails the feeling of having a really good cry.These three etchings – a supremely generous donation from Anish Kapoor, more usually known for the interactive theatricality of his large-scale sculptures – exude a quiet drama. Their simplicity belies their seductiveness velvety and intense, they draw you in, never quite revealing their secrets.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Wallinger was inspired by X-rays of Old Masters, which he thinks of as akin to spirit photography: “The revelation of the invisible, supernatural life of a painting.”A reminder of the pre-lockdown era, when we were able to wander the Hayward Gallery and bathe in the sea of pulsating colour that was Riley’s superb exhibition. This screenprint is from a series that vibrates right off the paper (Tate owns an edition of Elongated Triangles 5, so you’ll be in good company if you get your hands on this one).The essence of things is what Michael Craig-Martin seeks in his work, and colour is part of seducing the viewer to really look at the objects that make up our world. These sculptural reliefs in polished steel come from a series that pays homage to designers and architects whose vision has shaped what we think of as “modern”. You can’t sit on them, but look at them. Aren’t they beautiful?Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesSir Mark warned: “This is a virus that is going to be with us forever in some form or another and almost certainly will require repeated vaccinations.“So a bit like flu, people will need revaccination at regular intervals,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.

Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesGood Law Project’s letter claims the contract was unlawfully granted without any tender process and there was bias in play due to the company owners’ links to Michael Gove and Dominic Cummings. Ofqual’s controversial algorithm to be reviewed, regulatory body saysHow foreseeable was the A-level and GCSE fiasco, really?Government lifts cap on medical student places after A-level chaos A new grading system for qualifications had to be set up this year after exams were cancelled due to coronavirus. The government announced days after A-level results day that A-level and GCSE students could take teacher-assessed grades, following outcry over tens of thousands of A-level results being moderated down.An Ofqual spokesperson told  usual tendering rules did not apply to their contract with Public First  “due to the exceptional circumstances presented by the cancellation of exams” and “due to the need to urgently procure the work”. Good Law Project have said in their letter they believe there was enough time for a procurement process to go ahead after exams were cancelled in March.Exams fiasco ‘will be nothing compared to brewing scandal’ next yearRachel Wolf and James Frayne, the married couple who run Public First, “appear to have close personal and professional connections” with both Mr Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, and Mr Cummings, the UK prime minister’s chief adviser, their letter to Ofqual claims.

If they are not satisfied with Ofqual’s actions, they said they would issue judicial review proceedings in the High Court.Jolyon Maugham, the Good Law Project’s director, said: “We are now aware of three awards of contracts to Public First.“A river of public money is flowing into a business owned by close associates of the prime minister’s chief political adviser and his Cabinet Office minister – and all without any open, transparent tender process.”A Cabinet Office spokesperson told  Mr Gove had no involvement in the decision to grant the contract to Public First. Ofqual, Downing Street and the Cabinet Office have been approached by The Independent. Public First turned down a request for comment. An Ofqual spokesperson said: “Ofqual will respond to any correspondence in due course, once it has been received.”A government spokesperson said: “This is categorically untrue. No10 and the Cabinet Office had no involvement in the contract and did not discuss it with Ofqual.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.It was a moment that had been a long, long time coming, and when it did Kamala Harris grasped it with both hands.On a night freighted with history, the senator from California officially accepted the Democratic Party’s nomination to be vice president, the first woman of colour thus selected by a major party, and only the sixth woman in total in the US ever added to a ticket.In a speech that spread over more 15 minutes, and perhaps representing the de facto keynote address on the third night of the convention despite top billing going to Barack Obama, her words were at once warm and hopeful, yet firm. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesShe paid respect to the political pioneers that had gone before her, breaking the ground that would help allow a black American woman of South Asian heritage, build a career such as hers. And she paid tribute to her family, particularly her mother, Shyamala Gopalan Harris, who came to the US at the age of 18, and raised Kamala and her sister after their parents orced. She died in 2009. Ms Harris said that when her mother gave birth to her, aged just 25, at Kaiser Hospital in Oakland, California, she may have struggled to see just what lay in store for her daughter.DNC 2020“On that day, she probably could have never imagined that I would be standing before you now speaking these words: I accept your nomination for vice president of the United States of America,” she said. Ever since Joe Biden indicated in March of this year that were he to secure the nomination he would choose a woman as his running mate, there had been widespread anticipation he would select a woman of colour. Such a strategy appeared all the more vital and fair, following the killing by police in Minneapolis of an unarmed black man, triggering protests for racial justice that swept not just across the US, but around the world.In selecting the 55-year-old former prosecutor, Mr Biden said his main priority had been to find someone who could step into the job on day one, not merely a sound bite for a 77-year-old man, who will be the nation’s oldest president by far should he defeat Donald Trump in November.In her comments, Ms Harris noted that this week marked the 100th anniversary of the passage of the 19th amendment, which gave some women – white women – the right to vote.“So many of the black women who helped secure that victory were still prohibited from voting, long after its ratification. But they were undeterred,” she said. “Without fanfare or recognition, they organised, testified, rallied, marched, and fought—not just for their vote, but for a seat at the table.” No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And these women inspired us to pick up the torch, and fight on.”She named several female civil rights and political leaders — “Mary Church Terrell and Mary Mcleod Bethune. Fannie Lou Hamer and Diane Nash. Constance Baker Motley and Shirley Chisholm”. Ms Chisholm was both the first black congresswoman and the first black woman to make a run for the White House, back in 1972.“We’re not often taught their stories,” she added. “But as Americans, we all stand on their shoulders.”Trump’s strategy for dealing with the DNC is about to backfireMichelle Obama to hail Biden’s ‘grit and passion’ Why I can’t shake my disgust about being forced to vote for BidenMichelle Obama’s keynote speech at DNC expected to be major hitHer comments followed by an equally impassioned and hard-edged address by Mr Obama, who probably for the first time in four years in public, criticised Mr Trump by name. He said he feared for the state of the nation’s democracy should he secure a second term.“I did hope, for the sake of our country, that Donald Trump might show some interest in taking the job seriously that he might come to feel the weight of the office and discover some reverence for the democracy that had been placed in his care,” said Mr Obama. “But he never did.“If Mr Obama’s speech was heavy, and sombre, Ms Harris was able to inject a fair degree of energy into her words. Joe Biden will be relying on this verve to drive his campaign in the final three months, across a country beset by anxiety, economic hardship and the challenge of combatting the coronavirus pandemic. “Years from now, this moment will have passed,” said Ms Harris.  “And our children and our grandchildren will look in our eyes and they’re gonna ask us: Where were you when the stakes were so high? And we will tell them, not just how we felt – we will tell them what we did.” Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

But we can do everything possible to ensure our kids never miss a lesson again.”THE Chinese government’s horric treatment of Hong Kongers and Uighur Muslims violates every human rights law in the book.So we’re pleased that British ministers and royals are plotting to snub the rogue state by boycotting the  Winter Olympics.We know it’s just a gesture. But it’s an important one. When Britain refused to send dignitaries to Russia for the  World Cup, it galvanised our allies to stand up to Putin’s bullying.Two years on, the world is finally waking up to the menace that is China.And we’re proud that once again, Britain is leading the way.NEWS that deaths involving Covid have dropped to a level not seen since March is cause for cautious celebration.It’s proof that we really are over the worst of the virus — and that it’s safe for Brits to come out of hibernation.At the height of the pandemic, we rightly stayed at home to protect the NHS and save lives.Now, it’s our civic duty to protect the economy and save livelihoods by going back to work, to school and to the shops.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I can excuse the caution of Boris Johnson and Gavin Williamson deciding it was better to be safe than sorry in the early days of an unknown pandemic.But as the weeks turned into months and Generation Corona effectively lost a school year, I will never forgive the militant teaching unions for keeping them shut regardless of the social cost.It was a partisan play designed to damage a Tory government at a time when politics should not have mattered one iota.Unfortunately, the A-levels mess this week was depressingly inevitable from the moment the school gates slammed shut.A knee-jerk decision to cancel all exams without waiting to seethere was a way they could be sat in a socially distanced manner meant the current crisis was unavoidable.This situation CANNOT ever be repeated — but I’m fearful it’s already happening.Coronavirus is now being used as an excuse not to provide anything slightly dficult or complicated in all areas of our lives.But when it comes to education, the costs of that lazy caution are too great.I don’t know about you, but much of the development I experienced at school was down to my social interactions and extracurricular activities, rather than solely what was taught on the blackboard.Yet many schools are intending to use Covid- to justy axing breakfast and after-school clubs, banning music lessons and school productions, and stopping sports.It breaks my heart to see these opportunities indefinitely wrested from our youngsters with no scientic evidence to back up why.But it is being caused by a desire from adults to avoid ato normality.A King’s College London study this week revealed a majority of the public are supportive of our nightmarish “new normal”, with  per cent believing employees should be able to keep working at home until a vaccine is discovered and administered.This is cloud cuckoo land thinking. While the progress in Russia and at Oxford University looks positive, there is no guarantee we are going to have a vaccine at all.  So here’s an unpleasant newsflash: Covid is going to be part of our lives for many years. After all, smallpox is the only infectious disease to ever have been eradicated.Selfish adults can ruin their own lives by giving in to irrational hysteria, but they shouldn’t be allowed to destroy the fair education of our kids.The fightback against militant education unions, box-ticking bureaucrats and cruel social distancing regulations for students must begin today.MUCH media attention this past week has been focused on Labour MP Dawn Butler’s dubious claim that London cops are institutionally racist because they pulled over her and a black mate, even though they were driving in a vehicle with tinted windows, meaning the officers had NO IDEA of their colour.What’s far more disturbing is the release of new figures showing violent assaults on Met officers have increased by  per cent in the past three months, coinciding with a period of social unrest sparked by coronavirus and Black Lives Matter protests.Our police are under attack from all angles.They are filmed by baying members of the public desperate to show discrimination but unable to release their own body cam footage.They are accused of racism simply for arresting criminals.Andwe’re not careful, they will give up trying to stop many crimes because the potential repercussions aren’t worth it.DISTURBING news for celebrity lovers: The stars you probably think are nice are usually utter horrors in real le and those with bad reputations publicly are often delightful off camera.That’s my experience after two decades reporting on the entertainment industry both here and in Hollywood.So I’m fascinated to see a celebrity not being nice is now an offence that can see them be “cancelled”, becausethat goes on, there won’t be many left on the telly.This week, in one of the biggest celebrity reporting injustices I’ve ever seen, Nadia Sawalha was hit by claims she is nasty behind the scenes.Believe me, I saw it all over ten years working at ITV Daytime, but can vouch that the Loose Women star is one of the kindest and most genuine people I have ever met in the toxic world of showbiz.To suggest she is some sort of fake is beyond the pale.Nadia is adored by everyone backstage, her best friend is one of the broadcaster’s make-up artists, and she cares deeply about the folk she works with.While some TV stars don’t know the names of crew members they’ve worked with for years, Nadia befriends most of them.The vulnerable, self-deprecating, caring and honest-to-a-fault list you see on Loose is the real woman I know and adore.FIRST the US broadcaster HBO axed Gone With The Wind, before introducing a so-called “trigger warning” to the start of the classic film.Now it has sparked further outrage by doing the same thing to the Mel Brooks classic Blazing Saddles.If this woke attack on our culture continues, soon virtually every old film favourite will come with a sombre introduction by a liberal university professor outlining the social ills you’re about to witness.That got me thinking about what will end up being said before my three favourite films of all time :Grease: Contains ious examples of toxic masculinity, with Kenickie inappropriately invoking rape culture when he asks DannySandy “put up a fight”.The Wizard Of Oz: The scarecrow uses make-up to change the colour of his skin in an early example of blackface.The Sound Of Music: Glamorises a handsome young Nazi soldier called Rolf and features emotional abuse by the captain of his children, including the use of a whistle for discipline.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

In the Iowa caucuses, the first electoral contest of the campaign to become his party’s candidate, the -year old finished in a humiliating fth place. “I’m not going to sugarcoat it. We took a gut punch,” Biden declared after the disastrous result. One commentator on the news outlet CNBC was even more scathing: “His presidential hopes are finished.”Yet today, Biden stands on the threshold of the Oval Office. Victory is in his grasp. Having clawed his way back into the primaries and won the Democratic nomination to challenge Donald Trump, he could soon be the most powerful man on Earth. It is certainly his fight to lose. Some nationwide opinion polls put him no less than  points ahead of Trump, whose popularity has taken a battering because of the coronavirus crisis and the consequent economic recession. This week’s Democratic convention, including his own powerful, well-crafted speech last night, will have done nothing to undermine his lead.But with some worrying signs of mental decline, Bidens coronation could mean the reigns of power are actually handed to the hardline leftists around him - rather than to the ageing politician himself.What makes Biden’s comeback all the more remarkable is that his two previous attempts to reach the White House failed so miserably. In  his campaign fell apart after he was exposed plagiarising one of the speeches made by Neil Kinnock during the British General Election the previous year. Some of the passages were lted almost word for word. “Why am I the first Kinnock in a thousand generations to be able to go to university ” asked the Labour Leader.“Why is Joe Biden the first in his family ever to go to university ” asked the Democratic Senator. It does not say much for either Biden’s creativity or his judgement that he had to seek secret inspiration from a socialist mediocrity widely known at Westminster as the Welsh Windbag.In  Biden did even worse, dropping out after a woeful performance in the Iowa Caucuses, where he gained just one per cent of the total vote. During the campaign, he regularly put his foot in his mouth, most notoriously when he described his rival Barack Obama as “the first African-American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy”.This year, after Iowa, his chances seemed to be heading in the same sorry direction.But then, in the following months, he gradually emerged as the front-runner. This was mainly because the other leading candidates were seen as either too extreme or too unlikeable. Senator Elizabeth Warren was a hard advocate of toxic identity politics who unconvincingly claimed to have Native American blood. Bernie Sanders was North America’s answer to Jeremy Corbyn, complete with revolutionary economics and brutish tax plans. Peter Buttigieg was a sanctimonious mayor of a small city in Indiana, without any experience of the national stage.In contrast, Biden had not only been a Delaware senator for  years, but had also served as Vice-President throughout Obama’s time in the White House. Through these roles, he had built up a reputation as a moderate, helped by his image as an ordinary, down-to-earth guy rather than a member of the Washington elite.The son of a used car salesman, he was born in Scranton, Pennsylvania, the place where the US version of Ricky Gervais’s comedy The Office was set. His popular appeal was further enhanced by his personal story of having to cope with agonising grief, which he spelt out in raw, emotive terms last night.The catalogue of anguish includes the loss of his first we and daughter, killed in a car accident in  and the death of his son Beau from brain cancer in . Yet none of this can hide a disturbing reality about Biden, one that makes him profoundly unsuited to be the leader of the free world or the commander-in-chief of the US military.It is something that the Democrats have desperately tried to downplay, along with much of the media. But, the fact is that Joe Biden is in steep mental decline. Already by far the oldest Presidential candidate in history, he shows all the signs of advancing senility. He might be able to read effective from an autocue, as he showed last night, but in other settings, away from the podium, he regularly stumbles over his words, confuses facts, loses his train of thought, and lapses into coherence. His supporters say that he has always been “gaffe-prone” and that is true, but the problem goes much deeper. In the past, Biden could be sharp, even witty, as he showed in his triumphant  Vice-Presidential debate against the Republican Paul Ryan.Today, when speaking off the cuff, he struggles to string basic sentences together.Without the help of a teleprompter, this is a man who mixes up his we and sister, gets the names of countries wrong, and keeps repeating the same phrases. In one bizarre outburst in Iowa, he called a female reporter “a lying, dog-faced pony soldier”. In another contribution, he declared that he will “choose truth over facts”. With a delusional grasp of arithmetic, he has said that million women will be put back to work by his tax credit plan, that million Americans have been killed by guns since , and that million have died from Covid-. That is why, throughout the campaign, his minders have tried to keep him in his Delaware home, almost like a hostage. Major interviews have been banned, public appearances strictly rationed. It is a strategy that his team cynically justy by claiming that they want to protect the -year-old candidate from Covid-. But the determination to shield the potential next President from any accountability makes a mockery of democracy.It might seem bizarre that the Democratic party should march under the tattered standard of such a weakened general. But from the viewpoint of political operators on the left, his decline actually makes him an ideal candidate.His senility might have to be concealed from the public, but it can be ruthlessly exploited in private. Broken and bewildered, Biden is a puppet whose strings can easily be pulled by his hidden masters. Behind the thin veneer of his supposed moderation, the radicals can seize power and enact their hardline policies, like defunding the police, imposing financial reparations for slavery, rewriting American history, confiscating wealth, promoting transgender ideology, extending public ownership, and widening the scope of affirmative action. Precisely because he is now an empty vessel, a Biden Presidency would mean the ruthless enforcement of woke dogma. In fact, its unlikely that he will last a full four-year term. Therefore his Vice President Kamala Harris, an ambitious operator can start preparing for her reign.But perhaps she should not be too hasty. The Democrats’ opportunism could backfire badlyvoters become alienated by the idea of an enfeebled President.After all, the American political structure – in contrast to our Parliamentary system – is built on the concept of a strong executive headed by a powerful, elected head of state. Already Trump, never one to pull his punches, is running adverts that highlight concerns about the “cognitive decline” of “Sleepy Joe”. The commercials seem to be having an impact. Almost  per cent of Americans do not think that Biden will serve a full term, while other polls show the race narrowing. Trump could also be boosted by revulsion at the radical Democrats’ agenda, especially the collusion with urban violence.In  widespread unrest fuelled by the civil rights movement enabled the Republican Richard Nixon to defeat the Democrats under Hubert Humphrey. Famously, Nixon said that the “silent majority”, ignored by the media, had spoken. Today the same public mood could give Trump a second term.It would be no more than the Democrats deserve for their eagerness to hide the real Joe Biden.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Government has scrapped caps on student numbers but many universities are still grappling with finding enough space for the number of kids who met the terms of their offers. Universities admissions body UCAS found that an extra , students now have the grades to get into their first choice uni.Ms Donelan said in a letter to vice-chancellors: “Where possible, try to prioritise those from disadvantaged backgrounds for admission this year.”The failed algorithm for deciding A-level grades was ditched earlier this week in a massive Government U-turn, meaning more students met their university offers. But universities are concerned about litigious middle-class parents who might take up legal actiontheir kids dont get a place and have to take a gap year, according to The Times.Watchdog The Office for Students has backed the move to give priority to poorer school leavers. Chief exec Nicola Dandrige said:“While it is for universities to make inidual admissions decisions, students from disadvantaged backgrounds must not be allowed to slip through the net as admissions decisions are made.”But one admissions head has said universities may not follow the instruction, which does not set out how disadvantaged should be defined. There is a range of criteria normally relied on to decide who is from a deprived background - including those who lived in particular areas or attended schools where fewer people go onto higher education, as well as those from low-income families or ethnic minority backgrounds.The admissions head said: “In hard choices like these they would normally look at GCSE grades or parts of the personal statement. “I fear that many may already feel they have met their targets for disadvantaged children getting into university this year so have done enough.”Head of the Higher Education Policy Institute Nick Hillman, said it was not a simple decision. He said “If I was a vice-chancellor, or running admissions, I would worry that the wording is open to all sorts of challenges, even legal ones.“Do they have sufficiently robust information to make that fine judgment  Is it based on parents’ salaries, or ethnicity, or other characteristics  It is open to interpretation. How do you satisfy this without opening yourself up to potential legal challenges  No one is against giving an extra leg-up to people from very under-represented groups but there are a lot of litigious middle-class families out there and schools are very keen to ensure their progression rates are good this year.”Head of UCAS, Clare Marchant told BBC Radio  it was the right thing to do to prioritise poorer kids who are less likely to be able to take a gap year. She said: “I think it is absolutely the right intention. I think we know from all of our survey work that those from most disadvantaged backgrounds really, really worry about money. And sothey are deferred for a year, or asked to defer for a year, we’re likely to see a drop-off. And so that’s the real intent behind that.She added: “I think what I would say is that universities are very inidual, they make inidual decisions, but all of them, having spoke to a number of them at Universities UK over the course of the last days and weeks, are looking to be as super flexible — they want students to come to them.”The Office for Students is fighting off demands from campaigners that disadvantaged children should be given compensationthey have to take a gap year. Durham University has gone a step further to free up places and tried to convinced students to take a gap year by offering them a bursary.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Politicians have repeatedly let us down, their lack of clarity is baffling and there still appears to be no coherent plan.I’ve watched as people cared for the sick and mourned their dead, and at times, like many of you, I’ve been overwhelmed by dread.Then I look at my friend and colleague Kate Garraway, who has had to bear the burden of her husband Derek being ambushed by Covid- in April.Kate has been extraordinary, which is why I am furious with those who have criticised her for ing to work, when they have absolutely no idea of what she has been going through. She has decided to step back from GMB for a while to concentrate on Derek and their children and those who have criticised her should be ashamed of themselves for making things even more dficult for the whole family. Derek may now be free of the virus but the after-effects have been catastrophic.The poor man has been in an induced coma, and although now more aware of his surroundings, he is still extremely ill.Kate’s mantra “where there is le, there’s hope”, has kept her going, and I reckon on some level Derek is aware of how much she and their children, Darcy, , and -year-old Billy are willing him to make a recovery.Kate has been astonishingly brave and positive throughout this whole ordeal, although she was tearful this week when talking about Derek’s recent birthday. His family sang Happy Birthday to him via Facebook, which must have been bittersweet for all of them.She has had to maintain a brave face for her children and give them some sort of stability for the past five months.To try to further give their lives a bit more normality, Kate went back to work last month.In fact, she was actively encouraged to do so by doctors who felt it was essential for her wellbeing, and frankly, she has to make a living because she has two children to take care of.I know coming back to presenting duties on Good Morning Britain wasn’t easy for Kate, and there have been a few wobbles when she has given updates on how Derek is doing, but all of us are so proud of the way she has coped.That’s why the nasty, malicious carping from moronic trolls is so upsetting. How dare they have a go at Kate for hosting the show and having the “audacity” to smile and laugh at funny items with her co-hosts. It’s sickening, and no matter how much anyone tries to ignore such malevolent cretins, Kate will have been deeply hurt.I had a horrible feeling this might happen, but thankfully the vast majority of viewers wish her nothing but the best, and would be overjoyed to see Derek on the road to recovery. All of us admire Kate’s courage and honesty and know that even in the darkest of times, it’s vital to hang on to positivity and yes, to even have a giggle at something silly or absurd.Watching their mum back on TV gave much needed routine and stability to Darcy and Billy, especially seeing her smile and having fun. They knew it didn’t mean she is not worried sick about their dad, but were well aware he would want her to continue working and providing for the family.As a journalist, Kate has amassed so much knowledge about Covid- and she has also been tested to her very limits.Typically, she wants to pass on that knowledge to help others and is planning to write a book about her experiences and what she has learned during this tough time. It was always her plan to do a self-help book and she had begun it before the pandemic, but now her wise words will be even more relevant and helpful than ever. I can’t wait for the day when Derek is back home, growing stronger every day and the whole family is finally reunited, and I hope she is back at work with us very soon.Happy Birthday Madonna –  years old, mad as a box of frogs but looking utterly radiant surrounded by her children at a party in Jamaica.She can be infuriating and even downright bonkersbut there’s no one quite like her.She’s a trailblazer, was always a staunch ally for the LGBT community before it was trendy and has always paddled her own canoe.Long may Her Madge continue to reign, especially as right now we need some light relief wherever we can get it. I’M not in the least bit surprised that “dad bods” have become so popular among women of all ages. These are the bodies belonging to men who proudly show off rather cute little pot bellies and love handles.Becoming softer round the edges usually happens to blokes after the birth of a couple of kids, when they start to comfort eat due to lack of sleep and stop being obsessed with going to the gym.These boys trade top-of-the-range bikes and tight Lyrca cycling gear for comfy joggers while pushing a pram, and are all the better for it.Having a dad bod is also seen as a sign of confidence, being happy in your own skin and showing that you enjoy le and that having a weekend pizza and a couple of beers is more than OK.I reckon there’s nothing more off-putting than a man with a ripped six-pack who is no stranger to the mirror and exists on steroids and just steamed vegetables.They are usually dull, self-obsessed and not in the least bit alluring.Dad bods are far less intimidating and much more fun to cuddle. Like a lot of men, famous stars including Leonardo DiCaprio and Zac Efron have developed the Dad Bod during lockdown and have been roundly showing off their new physiques.I think they are far more sexy and desirable than when their cheekbones could cut through a home-made loaf. You have to get the balance right, though. When it tips over into a very large balcony hanging over “the nursery” then that’s no longer a Dad Bod but just a big old beer gut and it shows a man who has simply given up and is on a fast track to obesity and a heart attack. BRITNEY Spears is a grown-up woman with two teenage sons, a hugely successful music career and an adoring fan base. But the -year-old has less freedom than an impoverished girl in a Jane Austen novel.Since her much-publicised meltdown in  – when she went into a beauty salon and shaved her head, looking like a little lost deer caught in the headlights – Britney has had very little control over her le.Her father Jamie has legal “conservatorship” over his daughter, basically deciding where and how she lives her le and conducts her career. He also keeps hold of the purse strings.Last year he stepped away from the role, citing health problems of his own . . . and Britney doesn’t want him back.Thirteen years ago she was clearly suffering with mental health issues and needed her father’s help.But now Britney understandably wants control of her own destiny.This week she decided to fight back and took to the courts to have her human rights and civil liberties restored.But her bid was unsuccessful and she will need to wait until February  before taking further action.She is a fragile woman and obviously needs support. But looking at it from the outside, the kind of control her father exerts over Britney’s le seems way too much.Surely some kind of compromise can be reached, with the situation regularly revised to ensure Britney isn’t left feeling trapped like a songbird in a very gilded cage.I SIMPLY cannot begin to imagine the pain actor John Michie and his family are going through right now.This week, the man who supplied the drugs that killed John’s daughter in  had his manslaughter conviction quashed.Louella Fletcher-Michie had gone to a music festival with her boyfriend, Ceon Broughton, who gave her the hallucinogenic C-P drug and filmed her tripping for hours.

I co-hosted with the brilliant Jayde Adams, we had turns from Kerry Godliman, Shappi Khorsandi, Nathan Caton and Ed Gamble, and video messages from Aisling Bea and Nish Kumar, audiences watching on Zoom — something no one had ever imagined five months ago — on Facebook, and on Twitch, which I had assumed was an app for people in their twenties to chat each other up and worse.It was a brilliant night and the absolute kicker was that we had people in the room with us laughing .They were told not to overdo it for fear of aerosol transmission, but by God it felt good to have a real flesh-and-blood audience in front of me.Because here’s the thing about stand-up comics — they need an audience the way fish need water or Gavin Williamson needs chaos.But what we’ve discovered over the past couple of months, via these streamed gigs and now via gigs like the one I did on Sunday afternoon, in a car park under a gazebo, is that audiences seem to need stand-up too.It’s incredibly flattering, even for an old stager like me. On Sunday I played to  people prepared to ignore what the weather app on their phone might be saying, bring their camping chairs and sit in a car park in Tring, Herts.The comedians all seemed to savour every second of being on stage, of the delicious business of strangers laughing at their jokes together and sharing a mo-ment, a communal moment that means a lot after all these long months of doing what we’ve been asked and staying apart.Psychologically, what that might say about comedians is maybe not the thing we want to dwell on, what sort of wreck would need the laugh-ter of strangers to get them through the day  Move on!But this weekend’s gigs and the ones now springing up all over the country show that we all need the laughs it seems, the audiences too, and that nothing beats seeing it live, right there in front of you. And we can hear the laughs through the masks, don’t worry. There are more and more gigs springing up now, promoters and venues are innovating like mad, councils are doing everything they can to help get things off the ground.Some of these shows are outdoors, weather permitting affairs, some of them are under marquees and the like. Theatres are just getting going with shows with reduced capacity — at some places they’ll take your temperature on the way in, but it’s worth it for the laughs.Listings are popping up all over social media — you’ll find something near you. Don’t miss out. The shows that have been put together so far have been unforgettable and,nothing ,and when theatres do get up and running again, you can say: “Remember the time we saw this comic in a car park ”There’s something pretty exciting about seeing someone you’d have to go to an arena to see playing in a pub garden, too. Andit rains, well, stf upper lip and a good raincoat should get you through that. Hand on heart, the threat to our business is really worrying, like it is to any other right now, becausethe clubs close they will cut off the chance for new comics to get their acts together — literally — and for the new talent to come through. It’s all right for the likes of me, but the people who were set on going to the Edinburgh Fringe this summer — an event that has produced a ton of the funny people you might be familiar with — won’t get the chance for this year to be their year. Everyone has to start somewhere, andthe venues die, the whole thing dies.And that’s why it has been so amazing to see stuff being put on all over, in courtyards, pub gardens, car parks — even the biggest names can be seen doing their thing under an awning or gazebo — the audiences totally up for it and loving every moment. Because stand-up, like le, will find a way.

But she turned down the Dorchester amid a Hollywood boycott after the hotel chain’s owner, the Sultan of Brunei, introduced sharia law in his country.As the couples relationship progressed, Markus Anderson offered them a stay at a private four-bed cottage at the Cotswolds Soho Farmhouse and at the Soho House property at Babington in Somerset.The stay would have cost £,.Finding Freedom details the stay, with authors writing: In Oxfordshire, barely an hour-and-a-half outside of London, it was the perfect retreat from the city.Anderson later arranged for the couple to spend a weekend at Babington House, a Georgian manor near Bath. The retreats most expensive room costs £ a night.After news of Meghan and Harrys relationship broke, Meghans best friend, stylist Jessica Mulroney, was asked to help bring the future royal to the UK for a private visit.Authors say Mulroney arranged for Meghan to fly via a private jet belonging to Canadian couple Krystal Koo and Michael Cooper, who were said to be happy to help run interference.A flight on a private jet from Toronto to London would cost from £, one way.Meghan and Harry then became engaged - and much has been made of Meghans apparent dislike of the musty smell of St Georges Chapel where they tied the knot in May .In the end, Diptyque Baies dfusers were used, at a cost of £ each, with the book noting the smellies were provided by the company.After the wedding, the couple went on a secret honeymoon - to which they were allegedly flown by a private jet owned by a friend.The cost of that trip isnt known - because the destination was kept under wraps.But three months later, Meghan and Harry enjoyed a break with George Clooney and his lawyer we, Amal, at their home on Lake Como in Italy.They were flown there by the actors private jet at a cost of £,.The couple are well-known for their love of travel and in January  took a trip to the Arctic Circle together.The week in a cabin in Tromsö at the very tip of Norway would have cost around £,.Meghan and Harry spent a week dog-sledding, whale-watching and scanning the skies for auroras.The following year, they visited Australia and went on a date night with Meghans pal Jessica Mulroney and her husband Ben.The authors of the book claim a real-estate billionaire loaned them his home for the evening, with the friends enjoying a five-course meal.Although the cost of such an experience isnt known, its estimated it would have cost at least £,.In February , Meghan celebrated her baby shower with celebrity pals in New York, famously hitching a ride back to London with Amal Clooney.The flight home to Britain would have cost at least £,.Her blowout at the Mark Hotel cost an estimated £,, with the penthouse suite costing £, a night. It was a gt from pals who attended, including tennis star Serena Williams.In the summer of , Meghan, Harry and Archie took Elton Johns private plane from Ibiza to his home in Nice, France.This would cost about £,paid for privately. That same summer, Prince Harry made a trip to address the global elite at the Camp Google eco summit.At the summit, said to have cost the tech giant million, barefoot Harry spoke passionately about the environment.It is thought he was flown there by rented private jet and used a helicopter to travel around - at a total estimated cost of £,.However, the book says he flew one way by private jet.The tech giant footed the bill for everything, including travel to the resort and back, authors note.After the couple were married, they were gted Frogmore Cottage by the Queen.The Sussexes moved into the historic Grade II-listed house after spending £.million of taxpayers money to upgrade it. They have since said they will pay the money back after stepping down as royals. A -bedroom house on Crown land in Windsor recently sold for £.million.But its not the only expensive property which the couple have temporarily made their home.They stayed at the £.million Mille Fleurs house in Vancouver from November  until March .

And lots of parents have been alarmed to see their children stuck at home, in-active and putting on weight.Mr Fry says: “Schools have to do something about this. We will have to measure pupils next month and again in spring to seewhat has been creeping up during this enforced period of inactivity has been countered by being back at school.”I could not agree more that schools need to do something about this issue. But bringing back weighing kids in schools is problematic.Plenty of people have spoken up about how traumatic they found it being weighed at school, and the humiliation of being told they were overweight.But much worse is how many people have said that was the trigger for a letime of disordered eating.Jameela Jamil, the star of Netflix sitcom The Good Place, says: “Being weighed at school was truly the minute my eating disorder started at . I can trace it back to that exact day.”Cycling champ Elinor Barker, who won gold at the  Rio Olympics, reckons her own experience as an elite athlete shows “lighter is not always better”.She says: “I was the heaviest I’ve ever been when I won the Olympics. At my lightest I could barely get through a training week.”I have not heard anyone credit school weigh-ins with keeping them fit and healthy, with a balanced and positive relationship to food.Weighing children is problematic for so many reasons. It sends the message that they alone are responsible for their weight, when in fact taking care of their bodies with the right food and exercise is as much down to their parents, their school and the adults around them.But also, it becomes a form of body-shaming, and encourages children to focus only on the digits on the scales rather than the much bigger picture.It can plant the seeds of a letime of dficulty around food and is very often counterproductive.There are so many other ways to help children take responsibility for their own health.Schools need to make sports fun, ied and accessible to all children.In particular, they need to find ways to encourage teenage girls to participate, as this is the age when they often drop out of sports.School meals need to be healthy and delicious.And schools need to take meal times seriously and encourage children to do the same.We also need to inspire children to want to be healthy and fit. What about more talks in schools from sportsmen and women on how to exercise and what to eat  They are such good role models.Parents also have a massive role. We lead by example andwe have an unhealthy relationship with food, it’s likely our children will too.If we teach children about what their body needs to work properly, and how to cook tasty, nutritious meals which deliver that, they will be engaged in a positive way that has nothing to do with shame or guilt.HAPPY nd birthday, Madonna.She and toyboy Ahlamalik Williams, celebrated with an extravagant bash at Jamaica’s GoldenEye resort.And anyone who saw photos and videos of her shenanigans could be forgiven for thinking she is half her age.As she left the island, she posted on Instagram: “Thank you Jamaica. We have picked your flowers, eaten your fruit, danced to your music, enjoyed every sunset.”Whatever you think of her, there is something enviable about her ability to make the most of le.I hope I look as good as she does at her age but, more importantly, I hope I am still having as much fun.Some say: “Grow old gracefully.”She proves it is much more fun to grow old disgracefully.Celebrities have the potential to really make an impact and change lives – but not all of them do.So I love the story this week that Taylor Swt has donated more than £, to Vitoria Mario, a Tottenham teenager who started a GoFundMe appeal to become a mathematician, describing herself as a “black -year-old with a dream”.Vitoria, had been offered a place at Warwick University to study maths but could not afford to take it because she did not qualy for a student loan.When Taylor saw Vitoria’s GoFundMe appeal, she gave her the entire amount she had left to raise, along with a message saying: “I am so inspired by your drive and dedication to turning your dreams into reality . . . Good luck with everything you do! Love, Taylor.”Imagine waking up to that message .Cynics might suggest that Taylor does things like this for the publicity.But eventhat is true, who cares Vitoria will never forget this and it will likely change her le for ever.Also, how impressive that she found a way to follow her dreams and get the money she needs to go to university.We could all take a leaf out of the book of Britain’s oldest coronavirus survivor.At the grand old age of , she has revealed her secrets to staying healthy are eating an orange a day and “counting your blessings”.Angela Hutor has lived through both World Wars, as well as the Spanish Flu pandemic of .She caught Covid- in April and was so close to death that her daughter was called to hospital to say her final goodbyes. But Angela bounced back.Her advice this week to family and friends is to keep calm and occupied.Angela, from North London, is adamant Britain “will get through this” – and given all that she has survived, she should know.So let’s all take that on board. This lady has a great attitude, something we should all adopt.Frankie Bridge is under fire for posting a photo of her children watching iPads at the dinner table – with some people up in arms about how unacceptable it is.But perhaps people in glass houses should not throw stones.By which I mean that anyone who has children and wants to have a nice time knows kids are not always great at sitting through long, fancy dinners out.Some people think going out to dinner is a treat and children should learn to behave properly.Butyou ask young kids to sit and wait for their food, they will get restless.And there is a definite argument that going out to dinner should be a treat for the adults too.If that means a bit of screen time for the kids while at the table, well, who am I to judge GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

To date, the first vaccination was administered to  volunteers, while  received a placebo,” said Russia’s health watchdog Rospotrebnadzor.The vaccine aims to produce an immune response after two injections administered  to  days apart.Moscow hopes to have it registered by October and in production by November.The vaccine is made by Vector State Research Centre of Virology and Biotechnology, a Siberian institute that is one of only two places in the world permitted to keep stocks of deadly smallpox. The other is in the US.A former top-secret biological weapons research plant, Vector has worked on developing  possible vaccines for coronavirus which were tested on laboratory animals.Vector was once a key facility in the secret and illegal Soviet biological weapons programme.It produced smallpox on an industrial scale, while also weaponising deadly Marburg, after being set up in  by USSR leader Leonid Brezhnev, say reports.In recent years Vector has been involved in efforts to find cures and antidotes to killers such as bubonic plague, anthrax, ebola, hepatitis B, HIV, SARS and cancer.Moscow was criticised for rushing to register its first vaccine Sputnik V on August  without stage three clinical tests.And there have been reports of many side effects among the small number of “volunteers” - including serving army soldiers - who tested it.These included swelling, pain, hyperthermia - a high body temperature and itching at the place of injection.Volunteers suffered physical weakness or lack of energy, malaise, fever, decreased appetite, headaches, diarrhoea, pain in the oropharynx, nasal congestion, a sore throat and runny nose.Putin said one of his daughters - believed to be Katerina Tikhonova - had taken the first vaccine with no ill-effects.She had the vaccination at a very early stage of its development, it was claimed.There was no official confirmation that she was the vaccines recipient.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Recent outbreaks have emerged in Vietnam, New Zealand and parts of China where there had been no cases for some months.Importation of contaminated food and food packaging is a feasible source for such outbreaks and a source of clusters within existing outbreaks.While it can be confidently argued that transmission via contaminated food is not a major infection route, the potential for movement of contaminated items to a region with no Covid- and initiate an outbreak is an important hypothesis.An infected food handler has the potential to become an index case of a new outbreak. The international food market is massive and even a very unlikely event could be expected to occur from time to time.Prof James Wood, head of the Veterinary Medicine department at the University of Cambridge, told The Sunday : “The authors discuss, very sensibly, how it is important that factory workers must be incentivised not to go to work when symptomatic or in contact with Covid- cases.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

A pair of wooden chairs from the cottage were found at either side of the fence which appeared to be used to climb over, rather than using the gate into the field. The sheep farmer also worried of potential risk from a campfire due to the tinder dry conditions in recent weeks.In an interview with MailOnline, Mr Cameron said: Mr Johnson is meant to be leading the country and yet he is not setting a great example. Usuallypeople want to go inside a fenced area, they ask for permission first, but I was not asked at all. It is only polite to ask. He could have put up his tent in the garden of the cottage and there would have been no problem but he didnapost do that.  He could easily have damaged the fence by climbing over it as a short cut. There is a gate a little way up and they could have just used that. Mr Cameron, who has leased the land for  years, marched up to the picturesque spot and confronted the Prime Minister after a friend saw the pictures and tipped him off. He shook his head as he checked the tent and spotted a bundle of charred wood from the remains of the campfire.  Arriving at the cottage, Mr Johnsonaposs security team then promised the farmer to take it down and clear away any rubbish. Mr Cameron said: aposItaposs just that I was not told about it. Officers from politan Police apologised to Mr Cameron and said the PM thought the field was part of the property. The farmer complained directly to the officers that he had not been asked for permission for the tent to go up and watched as the area was cleared away.

We have heard time and time again that despite the ­heroics of our doctors and nurses, patients were left exposed because of catastrophic and avoidable failings. The Scottish government released its figures on hospital-­acquired infections at the beginning of June.

Shadow Health Minister Justin Madders said: “This data should be made available now –we do not know the extent of the problem we can’t possibly be in the best position possible to tackle it. “It is the least Matt Hancock can do to demonstrate to those that have lost loved ones this way that he is doing everything possible to prevent a repeat of that.” Lib Dem MP Layla Moran, who chairs the cross-party inquiry into coronavirus, said: “It appears the early warning signs were ignored, with devastating consequences for vulnerable patients and their families.”  Peter Walsh, of the patient safety charity Action against Medical Accidents, said: “The Government should routinely publish figures about hospital acquired Covid- and the ­resulting deaths. “Hospital trusts with high rates should be investigated and action taken.” The Families group’s lawyer, Elkan Abrahamson, said: “There is an absolute need for an urgent phase to this review to avoid further loss of le over the ­winter period.” A British Medical Association spokesman said: “We echo the call for more transparency to help improve infection control where necessary, and hospital data should be published to ­ensure trusts can get the support they need in further reducing the spread of the virus.” A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “As the new National Institute for Health Protection is formed, Public Health England will continue its work to protect and improve the public’s health, including publication of data. “The National Institute for Health Protection will be fully established in the spring of .

During the floods he was on holiday and during high-level meetings about the virus he was on a weekend break. Now, during the collapse of the economy, he’s camping. He’ll emerge from Brexit talks in Brussels, and say: “I’ve no idea what we decided as I was driving round the table in a kiddies’ pedal car.” Angela Merkel will announce that a report on post-Brexit imports was presented to the meeting but Boris Johnson set fire to it as he was bored so they’ve got to start all over again. And Britain has become worst at almost everything. We’ve had the highest rate of fatalities from the virus, the fewest tests, and the worst recession. It’s asthis government is determined we’re always at the bottom. Maybe they look on the internet and scream: “Oh no, India has more people killed by tigers than us. Let a couple out of London Zoo into Camden Market so we can be the worst at that as well.” And none of them ever resign.

How awful do the Conservatives have to get before they go behind  Would it make any dferencePriti Patel deported the -year-old Captain Tom Moore to Zimbabwe because he couldn’t find his passport  If Gavin Williamson outsourced school dinners to the Russian government, until all schoolkids turned a luminous green colour, would that damage them slightly in the polls  Maybe the Conservatives stay in front because Labour leader Keir Starmer may have been sensible and forensic, but most people haven’t noticed him yet. So he needs to make himself recognisable, by making the same points, but instead of making them in parliament, say them on Flog It!  Then he can make lots of forensic points about the Government’s failure to introduce a tracing system for Coronavirus, while finding out the value of a th century butter kne. And millions of pensioners will find out who he is. Instead of making clever points about the failures of the furlough system at Prime Minister’s Questions, that no one watches, he could present a similar speech on MTV’s Top  Grime Artists, interspersing plans for boosting the economy with his views on Stormzy and Skepta.

Just the man. Been looking for you ­everywhere. This A-level business, you’re going to have to go and do the telly.” Understandably, Mr W says: “Oh aye  Where’s the gaffer ” “Camping. Middle of nowhere. No signal.” Magnicent timing, Mr Johnson. Of all the weeks to head off on a “wilderness retreat” this was the one to pick. With the exam crisis, fresh economic worries, and the increased prospect of a second wave, what better time to take a break from running the country  Mr Johnson was finally tracked down and photographed – in the traditional British August holiday wear of a thick woolly hat – on the Scottish coast. It cost me some money this, as when it was announced earlier this week that the PM was going camping in Scotland, I offered some decent odds that this was absolutely, one hundred per cent, not going to be the case. He’s not the sort of fella who is going to pile the family in the Volvo, bolt on the roof rack, stick in a Crowded House tape and off you go. Lots of people agreed. “I just don’t see it,” one Whitehall insider said, “He doesn’t strike me as an outdoors type or anyone who knows their way round a ­rubber mallet. It would be the least successful camping trip since Deliverance.” Correct. It had Bear Grylls written all over it.  Not the survival skills bit but the part in Born Survivor where Bear told us he was living in the Calornia wilderness “off just a water bottle, a cup and a flint for making fire” but was really in a BB that did hot showers and excellent blueberry pancakes. As to my bet, there were a couple of takers – weirdly there are still people in politics who believe everything he says – and I am reluctantly paying out. Although I am still not sure you can call what the Prime Minister is doing camping. This is because he has pitched his tent fty yards from a, erm, house. Which he’s living in. It is made of bricks and costs £, a night. “It’s glamping,” said one staffer, smiling as he pocketed his winnings, “You wouldn’t understand.” It’s not though, is it  He has no ­intention of going in that tent unless he sneaks out at night with a torch and some sandwiches to read his comics.  Anyways, his absence has been noted.

Mum-of-three Jolene Stanley earns just £ a week but her sideline entering ­competitions means that is where she really cleans up. Jolene said: “From the first competition, I was addicted. “In the first year in , I won £, worth of prizes. “My friends and family joke that I must be the luckiest ­person in the country.” Jolene, , scours the web every day for prize draws and giveaways and has bagged more than £, in toys and treats for her family and friends. Her first massive win came when she was ­pregnant with her eldest son and saw her walk away with a £, top-of-the-range pram.  Since then, Jolene has pocketed everything from gig tickets to flash holidays, scooping so many freebies that last Christmas cost her next to nothing. She takes home between  and  prizes every single month, and says her luckiest streak was in September , when she picked up  prizes. Jolene has one son, Stanley Constable, seven, from a previous relationship, and two children, Ivy, three, and Charlie, one, with her carer ­partner James Houghton, . And they all share in her good fortune. Jolene now calls herself a seasoned “comper” – the term given to someone who enters prize giveaways religiously.  Just two months after she picked up her posh pram, Jolene landed a VIP ­experience driving supercars around a racetrack. She said: “I love winning but it’s not all about the big prizes. I love the little ones too, especially when they come from new brands and small businesses.” At first, although successful, Jolene was not organised. Rather than setting aside a specic time to scour the web for prizes, she checked her phone whenever she had a chance and entered as many competitions as she could.  But, at the start of , she vowed to be more strategic – and that system has brought in ­some reliable wins. Jolene said: “I decided I wanted to win enough to get Christmas for free. So, I started setting aside three nights a week for comping. “I’d categorise the prizes, ­dedicating one day to vouchers, one to toys and one to parenting giveaways. If I spotted something great during the day, I would enter that, too.” Jolene’s approach paid off as in  alone, she won around £, of freebies and managed to get Christmas virtually free, thanks to a pile of fab festive pressies and a deluxe dinner.  She said: “My total spend for Christmas was £. Everything  was taken care of by prizes. “I gave James a bottle of rum, a camping stove and a sock ­subscription and we also had a family day out at Gulliver’s theme park. “I gave Stanley a £ scooter and Ivy a new bike. I also won £ worth of Amazon vouchers, which I used to get stocking fillers. “Then I gave the kids a £ ­climbing frame as a joint present. I got a £ Tesco voucher and a £ LoveShop voucher, which can be used at multiple high street shops, which took care of everything .” One of Jolene’s favourite things about her hobby is that it allows her to spoil her loved ones.  In the past, she has taken friends and family with her on minibreaks, spa weekends, for afternoon tea or out for fancy meals. And once a month, kind-hearted Jolene, from Wivenhoe in Essex, also makes a ­donation to her local food bank. Her best prizes include tickets to a Spice Girls gig, a stay at a five-star resort in Portugal, a £, cooker and a seven-course dinner at a Michelin starred restaurant. Jolene has also bagged £, of ­holiday vouchers, a meal cooked by a private chef and a trip to Scotland. Most of her wins come through Instagram but she also scours Facebook and comping forums. “I make more from comping than I do from my job, she said. “The trip to Portugal will always stand out as one of the best things I’ve ever won. We were picked up from the airport by a private chauffeur and driven to this incredible resort. It was like being a celebrity.” And not only do her wins make ­wonderful surprises for her friends and family, they also make everyday le cheaper."},{"url":null,"title":"farmer who put metal shards","story":"NewsFarmer who put metal shards in Tesco baby food is ex-Tory councillorNigel Wright, , from Market Rasen, Lincolnshire, is facing up to  years in jail for blackmailing supermarket giant Tesco over baby food contaminated with shards of metalShareCommentsByPeter CraigNeil Murphy:,  AUG NewsNigel Wright, , faces a y prison sentence \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"What is really going on in politics  Get our daily email briefing straight to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Nigel Wright, , a married father-of-two, is now facing up to  years in jail for the plot which a judge said he had delighted in. Wright represented Grimsbyaposs Freshney ward on North East Lincolnshire Council after winning the seat for the Tories in . Previously he served as the youngest-ever chairman of the Great Grimsby Conservative Association.Wright later switched to UKIP and stood for the Brigg and Goole constituency in the  General Election, polling just , votes, reports GrimsbyLive.But at the Old Bailey on Thursday, Wright was convicted of contaminating jars of baby food with shards of metal in an elaborate blackmail of Tesco. He demanded £. million in Bitcoin from the retailer infor information about where he had hidden the jars.  The sheep farmer, from Market Rasen, in Lincolnshire, denied the charges. But he was found guilty of two counts of contaminating goods and three counts of blackmail. He claimed he was threatened by a group of travellers. The court heard two mothers found the metal fragments when they were feeding their children after Wright began his two-year campaign in the spring of . He threatened to inject tins of fruit with cyanide and salmonella unless the supermarket giant handed over the cash in Bitcoin.  Wright signed off his emails and letters aposGuy Brush  the Dairy Pirates + Tinkerbell the naughty fairy,apos and claimed he represented dairy farmers who had been underpaid by Tesco. He triggered two nationwide recalls on Cow  Gate and Heinz baby food as a result of the threats, prompting the supermarket to clear , products from the shelves. A detective posed as a Tesco employee named Sam Scott and handed over £, in the crypto-currency to trap the blackmailer. Wright was caught on CCTV buying wine and flowers for his we after placing a contaminated jar on the shelves of a Tesco branch in Lockerbie in Scotland on November  last year. He also placed two jars of contaminated food on the shelves of a shop in Rochdale, Greater Manchester.  Prosecutor Julian Christopher said Wright took aposdelightapos in his extravagant plan to outsmart the supermarket giant. He believed he could aposget richapos without leaving any trace of his identity by using the bitcoin cryptocurrency and downloading the browser Tor allowing for anonymous communication. But his emails and letters were forwarded onto police and he was soon unwittingly interacting with an undercover officer. A draft of an email to Tesco was found on one of Wrightaposs devices after his property was searched. The threat read: Imagine a babyaposs mouth cut open blood pouring out and the inside of their belly cut and bleeding. He was remanded in custody ahead of sentence due to take place at a date to be fixed after pre-sentence reports are prepared.  The sentencing next month at the Old Bailey is a world away from his respected role as a Conservative councillor for Freshney in the mid-s. Wright, then , was elected alongside fellow Tory Peter Bellini in May . During campaigning for the Freshney ward, Wright said: My aim is to make the community a clean and safer place, where children can play happily and people do not fear to venture out after dark. Wright campaigned for better flood defences in  after his farm in Healing, Lincolnshire, suffered thousands of pounds worth of crop damage.  A prize ewe he owned drowned, but he managed to save a flock of around  of his sheep. Silage from a nearby turkey farm had contaminated flood water. His animals were again in the news when one of his rams was killed by a dog. Wright called on all dog owners to ensure their pets were kept on a lead after that incident. Having lost his Freshney seat in May , he then stood for the Conservatives in Heneage in May , but came a distant third. He told voters he was fan of Road Wars and the Lord of the Rings Trilogy. He campaigned to reduce crime and fear of it.  In a debate in the council chamber about nuisance tenants he said it was essential to monitor behaviour and also to take preventative action.

But I’m coming out of it a dferent woman after the best – and worst – holiday of my le. I’ve been in Chamonix in the French Alps, where I’ve been coming for  years. But I’m used to a gentle kind of escape. Yes, I went on walks, but I left all that extreme outdoorsy stuff and zipwires for other people, especially as I have a fear of heights. Those sorts of adventures were not for me, I thought, and I stayed within the boundaries I’d ­articially created for myself. But since turning  in ­lockdown, I’ve got a new lease of le. I have more energy now than ever before, even though I’m going through the menopause. And I am very aware that we need to do things that make us feel alive and appreciate our time on the planet. Now more than ever. So this holiday, I signed up with a personal trainer, Quentin, for a -day Spartan training programme, which is pretty much the polar opposite of lazing on a beach. I did things that not only exhausted me, they frightened me. It was an hour of training every day, waking up for am, carrying lb on my shoulders and running up a steep hill and wading through ice-cold glacial waters, plus cardio sessions where I wanted to be sick. Pull-ups, weights, climbing walls, monkey bars – it was gruelling. I hated every minute and just when I thought I’d finished, he made me sprint for  more minutes. But you know what  I never stopped. I gritted my teeth, fought the tears and found my inner strength. And when it did finally finish and I was released for the day, I had the biggest sense of pride. I never knew I had such willpower and that my body possessed so much strength. Not bad for . What do you think  Join the debate in our comment section below But in Chamonix I have seen other -year-olds taking on ­ultra-marathons, -year-olds climbing peaks that make you shudder, and -year-olds, men and women, trekking for miles. This valley shatters the ­stereotype of putting your feet up as you get older. Knowing what I was capable of, mentally and physically, led me to have a completely dferent holiday with my kids as well.I went to the waterparks with them and jumped in from dizzying heights. Instead of thinking, “Nope, you daft idiot, you can’t do that”, I was saying, “you can do it!” And I wenton to conquer my fear of heights.With my -year-old son, I climbed ft up into the treetops and did an obstacle course where I had to balance on a thin wire. My heart was in my mouth, it was the most horrible experience of my le, but I did it. And then zip-wired over a beautul lake – I ‘d always thought I could never be one of those people. So many of us are stuck in our comfort zones and give up as we get older. You don’t have to go on an expensive holiday, but you can challenge yourself to do new things, no matter your age. And you should – to truly feel alive. Boris taking the teepee Boris Johnson has disappeared to Scotland on holiday. You’d think he could have waited. You wouldn’t have caught his hero, Churchill, booking a week at Butlin’s during the Battle of Britain. The PM left useless Gavin Williamson to cope with thousands of angry and upset A-level pupils, who needed far more consideration.  The PM has been tracked down to a teepee with his fiancée Carrie Symonds and their baby Wilfred. Let’s hope he’s doing his fair share of dirty nappies because he clearly doesn’t give a s*** about our kids. Food shop risk takes the biscuit More Covid confusion this week – can we catch it from our weekly shop or not  Lab tests have shown it can survive for hours,not days, on ious forms of plastic. And the virus is more stable at lower temperatures, which is how most food finds its way to our shops and doors. But some scientists reckon that outside a lab, the virus cannot survive for long anyway. Hmmm. To be on the safe side, the advice is to sanitise your hands after you get out of the shop – so pick, pack, wash. Then you should wash your hands after handling any packaging and before eating too. Which is a small price to pay for a custard cream. Taylor sums it up Teenager Vitoria Mario couldn’t afford to go to uni to study maths – until Taylor Swt entered the equation. The pop superstar donated £, to her GoFundMe page to help Vitoria smash the £, target she had set to cover her accommodation, food and books at Warwick University. Vitoria moved to London from Portugal four years ago, leaving behind her family. When she arrived, she couldn’t speak English, but has gone on to get two A*s and an A in her A-levels. She’s one smart girl but not eligible for any grants, so had to try her luck online.  She wrote she was a “black girl with a dream” and that dream was to be a mathematician, which would also help her family have a better le. And Taylor paid out to make that possible. But like Vitoria said, her story is not unique. So many talented kids from disadvantaged ­backgrounds can only dream of going to uni. And it would need more than TayTay’s piggy bank to sort that out... perhaps a government that wants to give everyone an equal chance at le  Jawahir set for Match of the Day Jawahir Roble is the first black, female, Muslim, hijab-wearing referee in the UK. A Somalian refugee, she hopes that one day she will be running around the pitch in the Premier League. JJ, as her friends call her, wants to inspire more women to get into refereeing and hopes England ladies will be the best football players in the world. Her parents were not happy with the idea of her playing football at first because she’s a girl and she had to hide her muddy boots when she came home. But their attitude changed when they saw her passion. Only a few tens of thousands of white male minds to change now, JJ. But I reckon she’s the girl for the job and there will soon be a seat for her on Match of the Day. Home school is out Not long to go until the school bell finally rings – and it will be music to my ears. My kids have been with me   since March and, boy, are they ready to shake off their mum and see their friends and teachers. Not being able to run around and have a giggle with their mates has hit them hard. At my son’s high school, they will continue playing cricket, but not rugby or football as they’re contact sports. And my daughter’s primary will have social bubbles to cut down on them bumping into other children. It’s going to be dferent, but I don’t think it will faze them.

The denim perennial has been in production since  and is a favourite of Hollywood stars and manual workers alike. Second place went to the s-defining Mary Quant-style miniskirt, while Leviaposs denim jackets, UGG boots and Fred Perry polo shirts completed the top five. The poll of , UK adults saw Barbour wax jackets, Ray-Ban Wayfarers and Hunter wellies also feature on the list. Thomas Berry, director of sustainable business for Farfetch, which commissioned the study as part of its drive to raise awareness of sustainable fashion, said: Now more than ever, customers are interested in making considered purchases that will stand the test of time. From pre-owned denim to iconic designer pieces, customers are willing to seek out and to invest in pieces that are conscious, durable and also timeless, regardless of trends. Nearly a fth of those polled named Christian Louboutinaposs famous red-bottomed shoes as an iconic statement piece. Although in terms of memorability, the classy designer shoe only came one place above the gardeneraposs favourite - Crocs. It also emerged that at some point in their lives,  per cent of adults have owned a classic Ralph Lauren polo shirt, and one in six have worn some iconic Nike Air Max trainers.  Half of those polled would still wear any of these memorable trends from years gone by, and three in  have hunted in a charity shop or vintage store to find one specic piece of clothing. Many of the items in the list have been handed down to Brits, who didnapost quite realise what they had, as three in  got rid of items given to them by older relatives, only to regret it later. But just under six in adults now say theyaposd rather have fewer quality pieces in their wardrobe, than lots of cheap items which wouldnapost last as long.  The average adult spends about three hours, and £, a month in charity or vintage clothing stores, with a third actively enjoying aposthe huntapos of finding the perfect garment. More than one in  have even spent a DECADE or longer searching high and low for that one mythical item which will complete their wardrobe.And  per cent agree that fashion is cyclical, and what was once trendy will become trendy again in the future.Despite the desire for more long-lasting clothing, only eight per cent of Brits say they aposalwaysapos shop sustainably, although  per cent apossometimesapos manage to.# The research, conducted via OnePoll, also found  per cent have cut down on clothes shopping in general to reduce their carbon footprint, while  per cent buy from stores which have good green credentials. While a further four in  will be sure to clear space from their wardrobe by giving away old clothes, before buying anything new.Following the findings, Farfetch have created a aposfashion footprintapos tool which gives people the chance to consider the environmental impact of their shopping. Thomas Berry added: The tool allows consumers, when choosing to make a purchase, to consider which materials can reduce the environmental impact of their purchases, and to see the environmental savings of incorporating pre-owned products into their wardrobes. To remind people of the iconic items and test their knowledge, Farfetch have created the ultimate quiz for fashionistas to try out. The top  most iconic fashion items of all time . Leviaposs s .

Harry sparked headlines in July when he told members of the Queen’s Commonwealth Trust that its history must be acknowledged and work done to “right those wrongs”. But in a web call with members last week, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex – president and vice-president of the trust – insisted they were keen to continue the Queen’s legacy. Royal watchers claim it is proof the couple are keen to improve relations with the Royal Family, which have been further soured by the book, Finding Freedom. It is understood the book – which reveals rts between the royals – was written with Harry and Meghan’s ­approval, but left the Queen ­“upset and disappointed”. In the latest web chat, Meghan, , admitted she was “newer to the Commonwealth”, but said: “It wasn’t until joining the family I was able to meet so many young people throughout the Commonwealth. “They came with a question, they always offered a solution and that’s why I’m incredibly proud to work with the QCT, but why it’s the continuation of the legacy of your grandmother.” Speaking from the couple’s new £million home in Calornia, -year-old Harry also heaped praise on his grandmother. He said the Queen, , had achieved everything she wanted to after taking on the “huge responsibility” of the Commonwealth. A source told the Sunday People: “The Queen is fiercely protective of the Commonwealth.She wants her work to carry on through younger family members when she’s gone. “It feels like Harry and Meghan are finally trying to build bridges as I think despite their popularity in certain quarters, it has dawned on them they need the Royal Family more than it needs them.” Ingrid Seward, editor of Majesty magazine, said: “When Meghan and Harry last spoke, they made fools of themselves.  They ­managed to ­confuse the ­uncomfortable history of the British Empire with the modern Commonwealth, which caused derision.” Ms Seward also told how the couple’s biggest asset was undoubtedly their family.

It will tackle discrimination like that faced by mixed-race Meghan herself as she grew up in Los Angeles. These are the first details to emerge of a project which the Duke and Duchess of Sussex have pitched to a string of network executives. A TV insider said: “They have suggested a series focusing on the empowerment of women and young girls in today’s world. “It will home in on race issues, something Meghan has always been passionate about. It’s got quite a political stance and will also draw on feminism. “They want the series to continue their vision of empowerment for young people.” Sources say the couple “will appear in it but it’s about ‘normal’ people, not them.” Last week, it emerged the couple pitched the idea to numerous companies in June – when they bought an £million estate in Santa Barbara, Calornia, where they live with son Archie. They intend to serve as joint producers of the project. Harry and Meghan hope to make a fortune with their own film and television production company after their break from the Royal Family. Their plans include providing voiceovers and producing documentaries on worthy issues, such as mental health and climate change. NBC Universal was among the networks that heard Harry and Meghan’s first pitch.They had a meeting with its top bosses – including chairman of content studios Bonnie Hammer, who has known Meghan, , since her days on the US show Suits. Meghan has described Ms Hammer as the woman who changed her le after she cast her in the legal drama. A friend of Meghan told Variety magazine that she has no intention of acting in any projects. The duchess narrated the Disney+ documentary Elephants, which came out in April. Last year Harry, , announced he was partnering with Oprah Winfrey on an Apple TV+ series about mental health.And he is to appear in a Netflix documentary about the Paralympic Games, which will air on Wednesday."},{"url":null,"title":"mirror newspaper tablet offer promotion","story":"NewsGet The Mirror free on tablet for two months*Its packed with breaking news, sport and entertainment - and is perfect during lockdownShareByDave Masters:,  APR Updated:,  APR News\" %, rgba, rgba, url\"News, views and top stories .

The money could be used for one of two potentially le-saving treatments, one of which is only available in the US. The only other option is more chemotherapy on the NHS, but this is not a cure for the cancer.

He told the inquest: She was really excited and looking for a fresh start. Le was really good and the future was looking better for everyone. The straw that broke the camel’s back was the restrictions - just being unable to cope with the restrictions, which is happening to a range of people in the UK at the moment.  He said on the morning of Emilyaposs death she wanted to go for a drive but was unable to as the family were isolating.

And deciding to reopen schools could push the Covid R rate above . The consequence of that would be more pubs shut, shops closed and local lockdowns. There are even warnings thatinfections get out of hand as a result of children going back, we may be in for another horrendous national lockdown. But, for once, the children aren’t the problem. It’s the grown-ups. Kids get the blame for super-spreading colds and flu, but Covid- does not act like that. Children are unlikely to get it, or become very sickthey do, or pass it on. It’s the , teachers ing to work, and parents gathering at the school gates who pose the greatest risk. So next month, we must brace ourselves for an upturn in illness. That does not make it wrong to get children back into class after more than five months’ absence. It is essential for their wellbeing that their education resumes. Join the debate in our comments section below and tell us what you think  What Chris Whitty and the UK’s other chief medical officers do today is lay out the realities of doing so. Which is more than can be said of Boris Johnson. Since the start of this pandemic, we have had promises of a world-beating this or a ground-breaking that – only for them to end in abject failure. His decision-making has been hesitant and dodgy, his mixed messaging downright dangerous. The PM would have probably done less harm by spending the entire crisis in a Scottish tent. But now he has come out of it, we urge him to start being upfront and honest with the British people. About the likelihood of a second national lockdown. About the real prospects for the economy. About plans for the future now we know Covid will be with us for at least nine months. The British are resilient. We have taken on a deadly invisible enemy. So we can easily take the clear and unnished truth. A sorry story What is it about have-it-all footballers that ends them up in trouble  Take Harry Maguire. He’s worth £million to Manchester United, so it pays him £, a week. With that kind of money he could buy his own deserted island – and do what ever he wants there with his mates. But he chose to holiday on Mykonos instead, where he now faces accusations of resisting arrest, hitting police officers and allegedly trying to bribe himself out of trouble. And now there’s the appalling possibility of doing time in a Greek jail.

Surgeons were forced to operate after the patient developed breathing problems and complained of acute pain in her abdomen. “We had found a progressive tumour in her oy which eventually led to pressure on her intestines,” said Dr Arun Prasad. “Subsequently this led to indigestion and an acute stomach ache.” Prasad added he had never seen such case in his three decades as a medical professional.

The enormous whale emerged from the water and snapped its mouth shut just a few feet from their small fishing boat off the coast of Castletownbere in Cork, Ireland. Thrilling footage shows the beastaposs shocking breach as it emerged from the water as yelps can be heard from the passengers onboard. The sea creatures typically weigh just over six tons and tend to measure about twice the size of the fishing boat. Local David Minihane took the video from onboard the boat alongside his three children and his friendaposs daughter. He told CorkBeo the group regularly go out on the boat and are used to the ocean creatures but that this incident was truly one to remember. The cameraman appeared shaken as the whale splashed the water all over the group before they gathered their belongings and began to chuckle.

I like what Olly Crankshaw brought to the Dee last term and a similar sort should be sought.At the back, a left-sider to push Jordan Marshall and a goalkeeper should be on the shopping list, while a No  to bang in the goals is needed.The clock has started ticking, let’s see what the next month and a half brings. . .Enjoying the privileged position of being able to attend games in person this season has been fantastic but minus fans it’s lacked something.Whether it’s passionate Dees banging on the Tannadice press box window celebrating a derby equaliser or hordes of Arabs heading for away days in the sun, they’ve been missed.It’s certainly earlier than expected but the September  date is promising. Fingers crossed it happens!There’s just no seeing past Bayern Munich for the Champions League is there  The Germans are an absolute powerhouse and, as good as PSG are, I don’t think they stand a chance in the Lisbon finale tomorrow.Arsenal ace Kieran Tierney lts lid on ex-Dundee United No Gordon Young#s attempts to sign him, working with Stevie Frail and his debut against Dundee\" title\"#Arsenal ace Kieran Tierney lts lid on ex-Dundee United No Gordon Young#s attempts to sign him, working with Stevie Frail and his debut against Dundee# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp arsenal-celtic-kieran-tierney-dundee-united-gordon-young-stevie-frail embed # secretWyaDSfYoJ\" data-secret\"WyaDSfYoJ\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

Football with fans is what it’s all about.“It will be terric to get supporters back and I am really looking forward to getting back to having them in the stadium backing us.“Common sense will tell you that in order for football clubs to grow you need finances and part of that is getting fans through the door.“So I would imagine it will have a positive impact on that front but, as a manager, it’s about having that backing from the stands.”With impeccable timing, Mellon revealed he himself had been unable to attend a game – Tuesday’s Champions League qualying tie between the Hoops and KR Reykjavik at Celtic Park on Tuesday night.He wanted to see Neil Lennon’s men in the flesh ahead of their league clash but Mellon explained: “We tried to get into the Celtic game but we couldn’t get tickets.“Celtic told us Uefa are not allowing anyone in to watch the games.“But with the technology you have now we have been able to watch all the games they have had recently.”Mellon witnessed, albeit virtually, that - thrashing of the Icelandic team and knows this is the greatest challenge his players will have faced since stepping up from the Championship.He said: “Whenever you play the champions in any country you know the challenge will be a big one.“But it is something you want to be involved in and get excited about.“We will be encouraging the players to get involved in all games so this is an opportunity to play in a fantastic game against the champions.“It is all positive because it gives us a chance to see where we are as a club and go attack it.“We believe we can make a positive impact – that is what we are in the Premiership for.“Given the size of this football club, that is what we should we doing. That is what the fans and the owners of the club expect.”The Tangerines have impressed in the way they have nullied threats from their opponents thus far, with Motherwell and Hibs in particular struggling to make headway against a solid midfield.This test is on another level but Mellon said: “We will be trying to find a way to make it dficult for Celtic. Every team has strengths and weaknesses, so we have to get an awful lot right on the day to get a result against Celtic.“But this is football and you always have a chance.”Arsenal ace Kieran Tierney lts lid on ex-Dundee United No Gordon Young#s attempts to sign him, working with Stevie Frail and his debut against Dundee\" title\"#Arsenal ace Kieran Tierney lts lid on ex-Dundee United No Gordon Young#s attempts to sign him, working with Stevie Frail and his debut against Dundee# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp arsenal-celtic-kieran-tierney-dundee-united-gordon-young-stevie-frail embed # secretJTZmAXcxG\" data-secret\"JTZmAXcxG\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

Of those,  were in the NHS Grampian area, compared with  in Tayside,  in Greater Glasgow and Clyde and four in Lanarkshire. No new deaths had been recorded in the last  hours.At her daily coronavirus briefing, Ms Sturgeon described the position in Aberdeen as “an improving situation” and said there was “no evidence” of transmission into Aberdeenshire or Moray.Ms Sturgeon said that when the local lockdown is reviewed on Sunday, the government would look at bringing Aberdeen into line with the rest of the country on some aspects of coronavirus policy, such as casinos and bingo halls reopening.We all hope and are optimistic that Aberdeen will be on the road back –not to complete normality then at least as much normality as the rest of the country very soon.”Nicola SturgeonElsewhere in Scotland, such venues are scheduled to come back into use on Monday. Previously, Ms Sturgeon has indicated that she would look at reopening Aberdeen’s non-licensed cafes on Wednesday.“On Sunday… we will review the lockdown restrictions in Aberdeen again,” Ms Sturgeon said. “And at that time we hope that we will be able to set out a firm timetable for the lting of these restrictions.“At that point we will also set out whether some of the changes that were announced more generally for the country yesterday – for example, the reopening of venues like bingo halls – will also apply in Aberdeen.”She added: “We all hope and are optimistic that Aberdeen will be on the road back –not to complete normality then at least as much normality as the rest of the country very soon.”The first minister added that there was “no evidence to suggest there had been wider transmission” beyond the city of Aberdeen.“That is something that has been looked at very carefully, particularly around Aberdeenshire, particularly given some of the travel patterns and proximity of communities there,” the first minister said.Ms Sturgeon said the cluster associated with those who gathered in the city’s pubs was now under control. But there was an “ongoing concern” about cases not associated with the cluster, but things were improving. In total,  cases have been identied in the Grampian Health Board area since the July .Of those,  were associated with the pub-linked cluster, and , contacts have been identied from those  cases. In the last  hours, there had been an additional seven cases not associated with the original cluster.Earlier this week Aberdeen City Council leaders expressed frustration that the city had not been allowed out of its three week lockdown earlier, warning that , jobs were at risk as a result of the coronavirus.Aberdeen City Council co-leader Jenny Laing said: “Of course we have to be mindful of public health, but we also have to be mindful of the economic implications, which could have an impact on public health as well.#It is about balancing competing harms. Economic damage could harm public health through unemployment and poverty. That’s why we thought, in line with the incident management team, that restrictions on travel, household gatherings and hospitality could have been lted earlier.”At her briefing, Ms Sturgeon repeated her warnings about house parties, saying indoor social gatherings were proving one of the major drivers of community transmission of the virus.She said: “That tells us that we need to be incredibly cautious about these kinds of gatherings.“I want to ask everybody again today to remember the advice that is in place and to comply with it.”Economy Secretary Fiona Hyslop repeated her plea for the UK Government#s furlough scheme to be extended, particularly in the hospitality and tourism industries.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

further factories linked to tayside coronavirus cluster as cases discovered across three council areas","story":"Two further factories have been linked to a growing coronavirus outbreak in Tayside, as new figures reveal the region now has the highest risk of local transmission anywhere in Scotland.The number of cases linked to the  Sisters food processing plant in Coupar Angus has risen to , and Nicola Sturgeon confirmed  employees have now tested positive for the virus, along with nine of their contacts.Speaking during the Scottish Government’s daily coronavirus briefing on the day Scotland recorded its second-highest number of new cases since May, Ms Sturgeon said  of the  new positive tests recorded overnight were in Tayside.A total of  of the new cases were in the Grampian health board area,  in Greater Glasgow and Clyde, and four in Lanarkshire.NHS Tayside announced on Thursday that anyone living in a household with a factory worker from the  Sisters site, including children, should self-isolate at home and get tested for Covid- as soon as possible.Ms Sturgeon said not all of the  Sisters workforce live in Coupar Angus so the situation involves people stretched across Perth and Kinross, Angus and Dundee.The first minister also confirmed two contacts #have links to other food processing factories in Tayside”, although it is not yet clear which businesses are affected.#The incident management team is now carrying out risk assessments at both of these sites,#Ms Sturgeon said.#There#s no evidence that this outbreak has spread to either factory at this stage but, as you can imagine, that is something that is being looked at very closely.#Ms Sturgeon said lockdown restrictions similar to the ones introduced in Aberdeen two weeks ago had not been imposed because there was currently #minimal evidence of community transmission in Tayside#.However, she said she could not rule out introducing further measures in the future and the situation would be kept under #very close review#.A new method of tracking the outbreak has revealed Perth and Kinross has the highest risk of local coronavirus transmission anywhere in Scotland and may require “greater vigilance” from health officials.The region has  surged past other areas dealing with local outbreaks, including Aberdeen, which became the site of Scotland’s first local lockdown following a cluster linked to pubs and bars in the city.A new Scottish Government report considered whether the current number of Covid- infections exceeds what health officials would expect at this stage of the epidemic, based on a new modelling system from Warwick University.It found six local authority areas – Perth and Kinross, Dundee, North Lanarkshire, Angus, Glasgow and Aberdeen – had exceeded expected levels but figures are beginning to trend towards normal.The new method is designed to be more useful than the R number – the average number of people infected by each person – because this figure can be volatile when the overall number of deaths is low.The report states: “While metrics such as the reproductive rate – R number – have been useful in guiding our response to coronavirus so far, the models we use rely on numbers of deaths to track the epidemic.“These have fallen to low levels, which means we need to find new ways to monitor trends in the epidemic.“One of the ways we can do this is to calculate whether the number of confirmed infectionsin each area exceeds the number that was expected, given the number recorded across the country – this is called ‘exceedance’.”Areas with an exceedance level above six are deemed to be at a higher risk of local transmission and may require “greater vigilance”, according to the report.In the week leading up to August , the only areas above this limit were Perth and Kinross, at ., and Dundee, where a number of workers at the  Sisters chicken factory live, at ..Angus came in at ., Aberdeen at ., and levels in Aberdeenshire are beginning to fall back towards background levels.The report stated in most cases the figures are “a reflection of a small number of cases” however, the ongoing nature of the outbreak in Perth and Kinross “may be a cause for concern”.Speaking about lessons learned from the clusters on Friday, Ms Sturgeon said indoor social gatherings are one of the major drivers of community transmission.She warned against defying guidelines on the number of people allowed indoors at once, which she said presented “a very signicant risk”.“That tells us that we need to be incredibly cautious about these kinds of gatherings,# she said. #I want to ask everybody again today to remember the advice that is in place and to comply with it.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including

Every day this week we have had lower numbers than Tayside, and it is clear the people of Aberdeen will be asking themselves why they are in lockdown and other parts of Scotland aren’t.“We have asked four or five times now what the infection rate in the city needs to be before the lockdown can be lted and we have never been able to get an answer from the Scottish Government.“We are only asking for clarity on when we will be able to reopen but they have not been able to tell us.#Mr Lumsden added: “They should be listening to the health professionals on the ground in Aberdeen and the lockdown should have been lted when the IMT recommended. What we are seeing now is lockdown being extended when the numbers are far higher in other parts of the country.“I don’t want to see any local lockdowns that aren’t needed because I know first-hand the harm that’s doing to our local economy. There are lots of businesses who can’t get through this.“There is an unfairness around this lockdown. They have got medical experts on the ground – why are they not listening to them ”The number of cases linked to the cluster which sparked the lockdown is .In her daily briefing, Ms Sturgeon explained the key dference between the Aberdeen cluster and the Tayside outbreak, which began at the  Sisters plant in Coupar Angus, was the risk of community transmission.She said: #Some people may be looking at Aberdeen and Coupar Angus and wondering why exactly the same approach is not being taken, and the key point is that the nature of the steps we take in dferent outbreaks has to depend on and be guided by the nature of the outbreak.#The assessment of the IMT in Coupar Angus is that there is minimal evidence of community transmission in Tayside.#That’s not something we were able to say with any confidence about the outbreak in Aberdeen.#So as things stand, there is a clear focal point for the Coupar Angus outbreak, which was not the case in Aberdeen where the outbreak was associated with a large number of venues across the city.#In each of these cases, and this will continue to be the case in future, we make decisions based on inidual circumstances that we’re dealing with.#In doing so, we take account of the specic risks that need to be addressed, and that is the approach we continue to take as we deal with dferent outbreaks in dferent parts of the country.#The First Minister said she hopes to be able to set out a #firm timetable# for the lting of restrictions tomorrow.In response to Mr Lumsden, a Scottish Government spokeswoman said: “Unfortunately there is no single level of infection that makes these decisions straightforward. We take into account prevalence, rate of positive tests, number of clusters and other factors. No country’s health advisers can  give an infection rate that means we are able to make certain decisions in regard to lting restrictions. There is a range of considerations about whether we can reach the conclusion that the overall situation in Aberdeen is sufficiently under control that we can start to lt the restrictions.“As the First Minister has made clear, we recognise in particular, the impact on businesses in Aberdeen, particularly those impacted by the restrictions and required to close. That’s why we have made available a £m grant support scheme for businesses in Aberdeen City impacted by local measures.#For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancellation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Evening Express website including all Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening Express n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb and ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t tMonthly n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayUnlimited access to all articles on the Evening Express website.

Without action and proper investment from central government vital public services will be at risk.This news of huge strain on local authority budgets comes as the SNP is delaying in opening up Scotland’s hospitality and tourism industry. Instead of following other parts of the UK and opening the sector on July , the separatists are forcing businesses to wait until July .This delay will cost businesses millions at a time when thousands of jobs are already on the line.The SNP is risking people#s livelihoods. It needs to accept responsibility for that and take action now.Councillor Alastair Redman,Sir,People occasionally ignore the elephant in the room to support their point of view, but in his latest letter, Councillor Alastair Redman has ignored an entire herd in his living room.In his latest rant he states that the SNP is failing councils as the cost of coronavirus could hit more than £ million, but surely these costs would be the same no matter who was in power He also suggests that #essential local services have been underfunded for years# yet fails to mention the years of needless austerity cuts, actioned by his party and their collaborators, to bail out the greedy and risky practices of the banks, which reduced funding to a devastatingly low level in general. It is worth noting that the Scottish Government has put a greater percentage of their curtailed income into NHS Scotland than any part part of the UK. This has helped NHS Scotland to outperform all of the others, in the UK, for the past five years. This is paying idends now.He s to his familiar attempt to insult by referring to citizens who want to take responsibility for making and managing decisions and working to make their country prosper within the priorities set by its citizens as #separatists#. I’m glad to be described as a separatist because the alternative is to be an apologist for an unrepresentative government in Westminster and to abdicate decision making to that same out-of-touch group.It is Councillor Redman’s final point, however, that demonstrates his blinkered sycophancy. His suggestion that the Scottish Government should follow the example of other parts of the UK. Could he really be saying that we should follow the chaotic shambles and incompetence that has emanated from his chums at Westminster  Does he seriously think that any sensible person, irrespective of their own political affiliation and from any of the devolved nations, would swap what their government#s have done for the Westminster model Sadly, nowhere in his missive does Councillor Redman take time to mention the health and safety of our citizens.It is this, together with scientic advice and without political point scoring, that is driving the Scottish Government#s response to this tragic pandemic.Kevin MacKaveney, TarbertSir,Following reports of littering around Argyll and Bute, including the Isle of Islay, the issue was discussed at a recent meeting of Islay Community Council where community councillors heard that items like rubber gloves have been found dumped in ditches.It is always very disappointing to hear about littering and fly-tipping but doubly so in an area like Islay where residents take such an understandable pride in their environment.We also need to bear in mind that items like disposable gloves can pose a threat to livestock. As well as being profoundly antisocial, this kind of behaviour can be positively harmful.Those acting irresponsibly should remember that there can be serious consequences to their thoughtlessness.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSPSir,We all have a role to play in the recovery of the country’s tourism industry after its reopening on July .Scots could help by taking a trip, visiting an attraction or experience, shopping locally, dining out and booking a staycation.Scottish tourism is facing its biggest challenge in a generation and will need financial support for some time to come to help it recover. The Scottish public has a crucial part to play in helping this happen.It#s easy to not think of yourself as a tourist in your own country but many of the experiences that we often enjoy with loved ones, such as holidays, shopping or eating out, all contribute to our visitor economy.July  marked a new era for the industry as we start to welcome back visitors and take our first steps on the road to a safe and responsible recovery. However, reopening won’t be the same for all businesses, many are still adapting to this #new normal#, so it#s important that we recognise that as we move forward to try and restore our industry.We look forward to helping Scots rediscover their own country in a way that is safe for everyone # visitors, residents and those working within the industry. Recovery will require our collective efforts and we must act as one to ensure the best possible outcomes for the whole of the visitor economy.Malcolm Roughead, VisitScotland chief executive"},{"url":null,"title":"the time for change is is now july 17 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThis isn’t really a campaign, it’s just the things that we should all be thinking aboutwe want Argyll # and the world – to be a recognisable place for our children and grandchildren to live in.The economic crisis could be seen as an opportunity to get started on the work that we know needs to happen.I think that many people in Argyll could continue to work from home people who have lost their jobs could be retrained, or use their existing skills, to do the work that is necessary for Argyll to become carbon-neutral. Walking and cycling infrastructure needs to be improved, trees can be planted, and renewable energy can be expanded and made more efficient.Transport and food are the most obvious areas for behavioural change in Argyll. We need to be promoting the benefits of electric cars and making them preferable to petrol or diesel cars.We can easily bring food production and consumption closer together by shopping and eating more locally and more naturally. Farming in Argyll is generally quite low impact, but does not have the capacity to feed everyone in the area, meaning that we have to buy in meat which is less sustainably farmed to make up the dference. If everyone ate only the meat that is produced locally, we could dramatically reduce the emissions caused from the transport of imported meat, as well as supporting our local market and ensuring that it remains natural and sustainable. Reducing food waste is also an easy behavioural change.Acting on climate change is all about thinking of others. Across the globe, the people who see the most adverse effects of climate change so far are those who are already marginalised and vulnerable.Kindness and common decency indicate that we must act with the needs of these people in mind, with the knowledge thatwe do not act, ‘these people’ will soon become us and our children.One thing that I think would make a huge dference would bewe all took #our whole selves# to work with us.Whatworld leaders were constantly thinking: #what would my children say about my role in this decision # This kind of moral thinking would make a huge dference in the future of industry and politics, and the more we educate the next generation, the more influence they will have on their parents.Everyone can make changes such as cutting down on their meat and dairy consumption, shopping locally, re-using plastic containers, recycling, composting, reducing food waste, buying fewer new things, using a renewable energy supplier, and cutting down or cutting out air travel.At the Paris Agreement in ,  nations decided to take measures to limit the global temperature increase to . degrees above pre-industrial levels. Our current behaviour will not allow for this.A rise of  degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels will mean that large areas of land around the equator will be uninhabitable, resulting in huge numbers of refugees fleeing for their survival. Sea level rise caused by the rapid melting of the ice caps will mean that small island states such as Kiribati and Tuvalu will be submerged. The combination of the loss of arable land and ocean acidication due to temperature increase will mean global food shortages, such that we have never seen before.The rich will still be able to buy food, but those who are already marginalised and vulnerable will find it increasingly dficult to access basic amenities like food and clean water, further stretching the inequality gap.It’s not too late to make changes, but it soon will be.We all need to have climate change in the forefront of our minds when making any kind of decision, be it personal or business. It is an omnipresent issue and every decision, however big or small, will have an effect."},{"url":null,"title":"science matters are aircraft vapour trails harmful","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAlthough much reduced by the Coronavirus pandemic, everyone has seen the vapour trails produced by high-flying aircraft as they streak across the sky. But what are they  and are they harmful Officially called contrails , these ephemeral, cloud-like structures are primarily made of ice crystals. They form at altitudes over , metres from water vapour in the aircraft’s engine exhaust as it freezes almost instantaneously at temperatures below minus  degrees celsius. There are, however, plenty of other volatiles and solid components in engine exhaust, including soot particles that often act as a nucleus around which the ice crystals form.Official figures show that air traffic contributes around five per cent of greenhouse gases. Yet these estimates only account for CO emissions. They do not include the effect of contrails, which can persist for hours and even expand into cirrus clouds several miles wide. These clouds, which are most abundant over North America and Europe, trap heat within Earth’s atmosphere, so do they improve our climate or contribute to global warming Air traffic has been steadily increasing year-on-year, so, assuming the coronavirus effect is a temporary one, estimates suggest that the distance flown by passengers will double every  years, and that air traffic will quadruple by . Therefore, it is imperative to determine how the increase in clouds created by contrails might affect us.In a recent study*, scientists used a climate model to analyse the future impact of contrails on climate change, taking into account their predicted increase balanced against any likely changes in engine soot emissions.The results show a three-fold increase in contrail cirrus coverage by , despite a  per cent reduction in soot emissions due to improved fuel and engine efficiency. These predictions cover all major air traffic routes and are mostly due to increased air traffic volume, although a sht to flying at higher altitudes also contributes. The area with the greatest increase will be Eastern Asia, where the largest rise in air traffic is expected.This previously unaccounted for, non-CO, climate impact of air traffic is now reckoned to have a more damaging effect on climate change than all the CO emitted from aircraft engines.*Atmos.

But it has also been a time of positive change and reflection, prompting people to be more creative. Writing, be it poetry, song writing or short stories, for example, has given many a way of making sense of this time, of sharing their feelings and looking after their mental health.For those who have found it dficult to know where to begin, Seil author Kenneth Steven offers this advice to help you start your creative writing journey.For me, there are two essential ingredients when it comes to setting out as a creative writer: time and space. By creative writing I mean poetry, short stories, novels and children’s writing: everything involving the use of the imagination.When someone claims they don’t have time to write, I don’t believe them as it’s a question of making time.PD James started writing when nursing a dying husband: he needed care all through the day. There was a part of the night when finally he went to sleep and she had the chance to put pen to paper, so that was what she did. If we are serious about wanting to write, we will make time.For many years I lived in Dunkeld, close to the entrance to the cathedral. When friends heard my address they would roll their eyes and say: ‘What a place to be. And you’re lucky enough to be a writer.’Except it wasn’t that easy. The truth is the modern world invaded even that idyllic corner of Scotland.First, there were thousands of pilgrim feet and voices. I was driven mad by not being able to find sufficient quiet. My former we watched a great deal of television. It was a tiny flat and the distant murmur of low voices maddened me because I couldn’t concentrate.It was she who suggested # probably to stop the grumbling # that I should have a cabin built in my mother’s garden in Aberfeldy, a place where I could hide away to write. After considering the idea for a few days, I realised she was right.When finally I sat down to start working in that simple shed among the trees, the words poured from the pen. I will never forget those first days. Poem after poem appeared as though by magic on the page. For me # and after many years of leading creative writing sessions, I would suggest for the vast majority of others too # finding real quiet makes all the dference.But it doesn’t have to be a hideaway in a garden it can be a living room or a bedroom or an attic – just at a time when others in the household are asleep or absent.There are few rules for creative writers, but one I have discovered is that we are all larks or owls. We’re either attracted to early morning or late evening.I have yet to meet anyone who has said they’re drawn to the mid-afternoon # what I term # hammock time, though that’s when I wrote in the Aberfeldy cabin. I’ve come to believe strongly you will use the time you are given. If that’s what you have, you will adapt to that rhythm.But I quickly came to realise in my cabin that I couldn’t simply turn on good writing like a tap. We go into our creative space weighed down by the modern world. We live lives beset by emails, phone calls and text messages. We are all expected to respond quickly.I think creative writers are generally poor when it comes to practice writing. The creative lives of visual artists, actors, singers and musicians are dominated by practice. Why should it be dferent for those from the writing community What do I mean by practice writing  Describing the view out of the window going back into memory to capture a moment as evocatively as possible imagining a dialogue between two characters. There’s no end to the possibilities. What practice writing provides is creative grounding. It brings us from being all over the place in our minds to give us creative focus.What this practice allows us to do is to start, then to pour ourselves into what I like to call deep writing. It creates a kind of doorway so the real writing can begin.Kenneth Steven is best-known as a poet. Sixteen of his collections have been published and he writes and presents poetry-related programmes for BBC Radio. He is also a Scottish novelist and children’s author. He’s written two handbooks on writing and led workshops and worked as writer in residence at home and abroad. www.kennethsteven"},{"url":null,"title":"if walls could talk","story":"Susan WindramUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsStrachur Smiddy opened its doors again on Saturday, August , after an uncertain few months due to Covid-.The museum will only be open on Saturdays and Sundays, until Sunday September , but for now families can again enjoy stepping back in time in the th-century blacksmith’s smiddy, which has been carefully repaired and restored to its original state and now acts as a working museum with with forge, bellows and anvil, cobbled floor, tools of the trade and beamed ceiling.Browse through the Smiddy’s collection of fascinating artefacts and tools.

So many people are intimidated by other vehicles. The Bikeability scheme gives children and adults the confidence to ride out safely.#The training, over three days, and was a mixture of games, exercises and on road practice, finishing with an assessment. The village#s fire engine was used to demonstrate to the youngsters how dficult they are to see from the cab of a large goods vehicle, particularly to the rear and near side at junctions.They also learned about primary and secondary road positions, right of way and good observational skills.They were even encouraged to ask their parentsthey do the #Dutch Reach# to keep passing cyclists safe. The Dutch Reach is a simple change of habit to help you open your car door safely. Instead of using the hand closest to the door, it means reaching across to open the door with the hand furthest from the door # your left handyou are the driver. This naturally turns your body towards the window, helping you spot approaching cyclists.Mr Catterwell added: #Thanks to Scottish Fire and Rescue Service for the use of the appliance and the drill yard, the Bike Bothy for administrative assistance and training materials and Graham Love for his excellent mechanical services. Also to residents and holiday makers around Craignish who were mostly respectful of the learner cyclists.#P S pupils Fergus Bennett, Beth Gregory, Magnus Hampton, Kay Neville, Harry Whittle and Reiley Van Der Zel received their Bikeability  badges.

Keep your wall colours neutral, like white and grey, but use your curtains, bedding and cushions to inject splashes of colour.Buying new bedding and hanging a new set of curtains can cost a lot less than a few tins of paint once you factor in all the rollers and brushes yoursquoll need to buy, plus it will take less time too.Once yoursquove bought the cushions, next time yoursquore thinking about changing the colour, just buy new covers and match the size of the cushions. That means you can store the others away, pass them on to a friend or use them in another room.Donrsquot forget about artwork. You can find some really trendy prints online and IKEA is great for cheap frames too. Make sure you buy the same size prints each time, meaning you can keep the same frames. You can update the frames easily too with a cheap can of spray paint.Canrsquot afford a new carpet  Yoursquoll be amazed at what a good deep clean and adding a colourful or patterned rug can do.If your furniture is looking a bit tired, upcycle with a lick of paint and new door handles. You can pick up a tin of furniture paint from most hardware stores or online and you can buy cute, quirky doorknobs from eBay or Etsy, or even just try spray painting the existing ones.Metal accessories like curtain rods and light fittings can benefit from that spray paint too!Upcycling is a great way to keep costs low, give a much loved item a new lease of le and is good for the environment by cutting out waste.Living roomMoving on to the most used room in the house, this can be the most dficult to update as it no doubt has many uses. From the TV room to the playroom to the dining room, your living space probably needs to be more practical than anything . But you can still add some style along the way.Your sofa likely dominates the room and can be the most expensive piece in the room ndash with the exception of the TV! So replacing this often can be costly. But have you considered replacing the covers  If your sofa is in generally good condition but itrsquos looking a bit off-colour, you can buy covers that fit over the top.IKEA do a range of these covers that are made for their sofa ranges, but you can find places online that offer made to measure services. This can be more expensive, but definitely cheaper than buying a whole new sofa and are machine washable! Alternatively, adding a new throw and some scatter cushions can have the same effect.Many of the tips for the bedroom can be used in the living room too. Like adding a nice feature wall for a splash of colour or why not try adding a nice gallery wall with lots of family pictures  A great way to add a personal touch to a room. You can even get the family involved to pick out their favourite pictures.,params: .pushPlants are a great way to brighten up a room and fill any unused corners.

With recycling centres and charity shops open again therersquos no excuse. Spend the weekend sorting through any unwanted items and donate where you can.For storage solutions, you need to think outside the box ndash literally. Vacuum bags are ideal, they normally come in multipacks of ious sizes and are really cheap. Great for anything soft that is taking up a lot of space. Winter clothes, quilts and blankets can be reduced to a tenth of the size and slide under the bed nicely.If floor space is a problem, then the sky is the limit. Consider storing items that arenrsquot needed on a regular basis above units or wardrobes. Think about shelving units that are tall and slim, rather than long and bulky.Cheap and cheerful plastic, canvas or cardboard boxes can help to keep everything in place while adding a splash of colour and style. Perfect for keeping clutter off the floor.Shelves above radiators are a great way to use otherwise wasted space.If the kids are desperate for some space, a reading nook or kids study area can easily be achieved under the stairs or a window. A simple storage box with a couple of cushions on top will create a comfy seat and can double up as extra storage.Hooks can be attached to pretty much anything like bedroom doors and inside cupboards ndash again keeping items off the floor will create the illusion of more space. In the kitchen, using hooks to hang pots and pans and magnets for knives can free up cupboard space and make a statement.Knowing where things are is half the battle when considering storage options, so think about clear plastic boxes or bags that are easy to see into and can be labelled.Flexible furniture like extendable dining tables, sofa beds and even clothes rails are ideal as they have multiple uses and can be stored away easily when not in use.Let there be lightLighting and mirrors are your friends when it comes to making a smaller room feel bigger. Change large floor lamps for smaller wall lights and when it comes to wall colour, stick to pale colours and swap out heavy curtains with blinds. Luckily, a big tub of value white paint goes a long way. Let in as much light as possible, give the windows a good scrub and update yellowing lightbulbs to bright white.OutdoorsIs it time to rethink that huge sofa set and professional sized goal posts  When buying furniture, think small, light and foldable so that they can be stored away in a shed or cupboard or easily moved around. Updating your garden furniture doesnrsquot need to cost the earth, yoursquoll find some really great bargain sets in supermarkets like Aldi, Asda and Tesco and homeware stores like BM.Another way to make it feel bigger is to simply give it a good tidy. Yoursquoll be surprised at how much space you do have after clearing out those unwanted flowerpots, cutting the grass and trimming back the hedges.Your home is an investment, to be enjoyed for a long time and with these simple but effective ideas, you can enjoy the space you have for longer."},{"url":null,"title":"young-people-scotland-can-get-250-free-starting-new-job","story":"Young people across Scotland could be in line for as much as pound free from the Government for starting a new job, thanks to a new benefit.Its hoped the payment, which is open for applications from today, will help young people with the financial dficulties of starting a new job - including buying new clothes, travel and get childcare.It is estimated around  young people will benefit from the new financial support in its first year.What is the benefit The Job Start Payment is a one-off sum of pound for  to -year-oldsthey have been unemployed for at least six months.The upper age limit rises to  for care leavers and the payment increases to poundthe person has a child.How can I qualy for the payment To qualy for the payment, which will be delivered by Social Security Scotland, the person applying must have received a job offer for paid employment.They must be out of paid work and must have been receiving one of the qualying benefits for six months or more at the time of the job offer:Income-based Jobseekerrsquos AllowanceIncome SupportIncome-related Employment and Support AllowanceUniversal CreditWhat has the Scottish Government said Social Security Secretary Shirley-Anne Somerville said: ldquoI am delighted that our Job Start Payment is today now open for applications it really couldnrsquot come at a better time to support our young people to take up job offers.ldquoYoung people are among those whose job prospects have been hardest hit by this pandemic.

councillor for Musselburgh West said: ldquoTragically,  local objectors and , petitioners have less value than the share value of these gigantic corporations.He called on councillors on the planning committee, which will debate the proposal on Tuesday, to halt the ldquobetrayal.Mr McAllister also lodged a formal objection, citing a range of concerns including traffic congestion, pollution, litter, obesity, residential amenity and economic damage.He claimed: ldquoThe custom predicted for this -hour McDonaldrsquos drive-thru and the intensity of the declared deliveries needed to service it are on an industrial scale. The impact on Olivebank Road would be truly calamitous.The plan will go before a lsquovirtualrsquo meeting of the planning committee after being called off the delegated list by ward councillor Stuart Currie because of the level of local concern.He said: ldquoI have called this application off the list to ensure that all the concerns raised by local residents are discussed and elected members can understand not only the strength of feeling but also the planning issues that exist as a result of this application.Musselburgh  Inveresk Community Council has lodged an objection, citing traffic congestion, emissions, and the facilityrsquos close proximity to local schools as concerns.A public campaign lsquoNo McDonaldrsquos in Musselburghrsquo was also launched in a bid to halt the plan, highlighting concerns such as increased traffic congestion, litter and air pollution.The planning report stated that there were  written representations to the application and, of these,  were objections.It said: ldquoThe councilrsquos road services advise they accept the conclusions of the traffic network modelling exercise, that the traffic impact associated with the proposed development would be minimal and there would be no adverse impact on the operation of the local highway network.ldquoMany written objections are made on the grounds of the proximity of the proposed drive-thru restaurant to Musselburgh Grammar School, and that such a facility promotes unhealthy eating and thus would lead to harmful health consequences.ldquoThe East Lothian Local Development Plan  does not contain any policies restricting the location of drive-thru restaurant facilities to a certain distance from schools, or any other educational establishments. Nor does it contain any policies relating to unhealthy eating or the health consequences of proposed developments. Thus, and in the absence of national guidance on health consequences of proposed developments, no signicant weight can be given to these matters.The report added: ldquoOn the matter of air quality, the public health and environmental protection officer advised that the proposed development was anticipated to result in up to  customer vehicles visiting the premises daily, which was a signicant number of additional vehicles given the proximity of site to the Air Quality Management Areaon Musselburgh High Street.The officer agreed with the conclusion of McDonaldrsquos Air Quality Assessment that impacts upon air quality at ldquosensitive receptors would not be signicant. The officer advised that, whilst it was acknowledged that additional traffic would have an impact upon queuing and reduce traffic speeds, the composition of the increased traffic would be from passenger cars, which are less polluting than HGVs and buses.The officer concluded that the proposed development would have ldquono harmful impact on air quality nor on the objectives of the AQMA and would not harm the amenity of the area.A McDonaldrsquos spokesperson said: ldquoWe look forward to progressing with this application and believe a new McDonaldrsquos would bring signicant investment to the local community, as well as create at least  new jobs.A supporting statement from the company added: ldquoThere are few restaurants in the country who can claim to have made so many positive changes to support healthier lestyles.

E-bikes offer a greater mileage for commuting with less physical effort required and a safer means of physical distancing.ldquoE-bike public hire stations, which will be managed by another company, will be installed in Musselburgh at the Brunton Hall and next to Musselburgh Train Station in autumn.ldquoE-bike hire areas in other towns across East Lothian are proposed. In addition, discussions are ongoing with local bike shop businesses as to how they can support the public hire scheme.Public Bike Shareschemes have been introduced across the world, with many using docks which lock the bicycles in and release them for a small fee or with use of a card to users however, their success in the UK has been limited, with vandalism a major concern.In London, Santander Cycles operates a successful scheme which has spread to Swansea and Milton Keynes, with users issued a key to access the bicycles, which cost pound and allow free use for the first  minutes and then charge pound for every additional  minutes.East Lothian Council said that as well as Musselburgh, there were plans to have public hire stations for e-bikes in Haddington town centre and at Prestonpans Railway Station, Longniddry Railway Station, Memorial Square in Prestonpans, Civic Square in Tranent and Memorial Park in Cockenzie, each of which would have capacity for eight bikes.East Lothian MP Kenny MacAskill described the changes as ldquoreclaiming the streets.He said: ldquoThis is a challenge but equally an opportunity, offering other public health improvements, as well as the required social distancing. Reducing air pollution and promoting walking and cycling will have benefits for us all. Providing adequate car parking remains essential, with vehicular access understandably restricted. Itrsquos not easy but it can be done. As communities on the continent have discovered, people reclaiming their streets has benefits for all.Iain Gray, East Lothian MSP, said: ldquoThe substantial increase in the number of people walking and cycling, both locally and across the UK, was one of the positive unintended consequences of lockdown.ldquoThis clearly brings benefits for both the health of the iniduals doing more walking and cycling, and for the environmentit means fewer vehicles on our roads.ldquoTherefore, I welcome measures to encourage and support the continuation of this growth in walking and cycling as we move out of lockdown.ldquoHowever, changes must be designed and implemented with ongoing consultation with the local communities affected.In a report to councillors, Peter Forsyth, the councilrsquos assets manager, revealed ambitions to make the most of the side effects of lockdown.He said: ldquoThe Covid- shutdown has resulted in less air pollution and reduced greenhouse gas emissions primarily due to extensive travel restrictions. Other positive impacts have included reduced energy consumption, and increased walking and cycling. Accordingly, there are opportunities for a lsquoGreen Recoveryrsquo, adapting to new ways of working with increased changes to travel behaviour all in support to the transition to a low carbon economy and low carbon lestyles for the longer term that will enable us to continue to tackle the climate emergency.A council spokesperson said: ldquoAs part of Spaces for People, we are proposing the installation of e-bikes in suitable locations. E-bikes are becoming increasingly popular as an active travel option which could be potentially attractive as an alternative form of clean, green transportation.

This is how I heard about an otter at the Esk for the first time three years ago.A few people mentioned they had seen this elusive creature a few years ago, but never since.The otter became my new photography challenge. I tried visiting the river at dferent times of the day, especially at dawn and dusk, when otters are more active, always trying to keep the noise down to a minimum.After two years of searching, my hope was gone and I almost gave up. Until one sunny day in April during lockdownhellipThe weather that day was enjoyable, so Chris and I decided to go on a walk. The local path was very busy the dog walkers, cyclists, families with children and joggers were enjoying the sun whilst social distancing.As always, I kept my eyes low on the water hoping to see the kingfisher.As we followed the river upstream to the area at The Grove, I spotted something moving in the water.I grabbed Chrisrsquo hand and I pulled him down on the ground right behind a bush.It was not a kingfisher but something I did not expect to see in the middle of the day... an otter fishing!We managed to crawl down the slope and lie down so we would not disturbit.Whilst I was photographing the otter, I also heard a cheery pee-pee-pee and saw the kingfisher flying past the otter. What a day!Since then I have seen the otter a couple more times.The Eurasian otter is a secretive, semi-aquatic species with chocolate brown fur, webbed feet, and a powerful tail. Their thick coats are built of two layers of fur: an inner layer that works as insulation, and the outer, waterproof layer. The two-layered system prevents their skin from direct contact with water and subsequent temperature loss.Their nostrils and ears stay closed as otters swim underwater.Despite being excellent swimmers, they cannot hold their breath underwater for long periods the average time underwater is about  seconds as they e.Otters are solitary, territorial animals, that live in underground holes called lsquoholtsrsquo.

Butthe free traders and corporate influencers in Westminster get their way and deregulate the law that currently governs genetic engineering there, gene edited foods could be green lighted, unlabelled, for English plates, so that most people wouldnrsquot realise that they were eating them.Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland would then be put under heavy international corporate pressure to do the same.Like the old guard, now stigmatised, genetically modiedfood before it, with its unhappy history of failures to deliver and creation of new problems, such as the creation of herbicide-resistant super-weeds, proponents of gene editing spin futuristic yarns about all the miracles theyrsquore rustling up for us.Less starchy potatoes and corn, pork from super-muscly pigs, spicy tomatoes, and mushrooms that resist browning, are some front runners. In fact the mushrooms have already bypassed US Department of Agriculture regulation.How can this second wave of genetically engineered foods be a realistic prospect when the first lot were so unpopular in the UK and the EU that the general public shunned them Proponents claim that gene editing is a precise, safe technology with predictable outcomes. Sound familiar  They say that theyrsquore only making very small changes to the genetic make-up of foods, merely mimicking what might happen through natural mutation.Tellingly, they seek patents for these altered foods. Patents are only grantedyou can show an inventive step that is man-made. So claims that gene editing is simply causing changes that could happen naturally go out the window.Donrsquot worry, though, they assure us that gene editing carries no more risk than conventional breeding. In fact, there is no evidence to support this blaseacute assertion because no feeding studies have been carried out in either humans or animals.Along with scientists from around the world, I attended a briefing on gene editing led by the London-based molecular geneticist Dr Michael Antoniou. It left me deeply concerned. He flagged up the growing body of gold standard scientic research that highlights the unintended and potentially dangerous risks that gene edited foods pose. Far from being precise and predictable, these lab-based, articial interventions damage plant or animal DNA, not just at the intended site of the genetic alteration, but where.For instance, it emerged last year that a hornless bull gene edited by a Minnesota company was unintentionally contaminated by bacterial genes from another species. https:www.technologyreview     recombinetics-gene-edited-hornless-cattle-major-dna-screwup Gene editing alters how genes , which can create new allergens and toxins.

The leader of its family policy unit is Cristina Odone, former editor of The Catholic Herald. As such its , among others, is to shore up classic Conservative family values, at the heart of which is marriage. Sadly, the present Prime Minister seems not to have received the memo.Setting aside for the moment the religious and political leanings of those behind this report, its conclusions show the stark and widening gulf between the married well-off and the unmarried poor. Medicine has long recognised the advantages ndash especially to men ndash of tying the knot, but the CSJrsquos findings focus on the enormous benefit that marriage bestows not on the couple, but on their children.Despite being lauded by David Cameron as ldquoa great institution, few subjects have been more ripe for ridicule. The butt of stand-ups down the ages, matrimony is the gag that never stops giving. It can be plumbed endlessly for laughs by the cynical, the wry, the embittered and the romantic. Yet the conclusions of the Centre for Social Justicersquos report are anything but funny.Their statistics show that those on low incomes are far less keen to wed than the wealthy. Once children are born, cohabiting parents are almost four times more likely to separate before a child is five than married parents. The health and educational attainment of children with broken family backgrounds are worse, and their likelihood of having a criminal conviction by the age of  doublestheir parents separated before they were five.These statistics certainly cast matrimony in a starkly black and white light. And it gets worse. The middle classes are not only more likely to marry, but % of high earners do so, compared to % of the poorest. If a straight line can be drawn between cohabitation and unstable family relationships, that is bad news for youngsters from disadvantaged backgrounds. Butmarriage truly is the key factor in this downward trajectory,a set of vows and a certicate and a wedding video is the glue that holds the middle classes together, then that is a whole other issue. Suddenly a custom that previously was prevalent across the classes is in danger of becoming a status symbol. Marriage, by this calculation, is synonymous with money.I grew up in the wake of the Beatles and the moon landing, when walking down the aisle was no longer essential, evenyou hoped to have children. Nevertheless the stigma of cohabiting, or becoming parents before you wore a wedding ring, took a long time to fade. When finally it became commonplace society grew more civilised, acknowledging that couples didnrsquot require an official document to take themselves, and be taken, seriously. Cohabiting was no more a byword for casual than marrying was for happy. Yet now, it is deemed a red flag for social disadvantage.The direct correlation between marriage and class suggests that money is at least part of the explanation. Those who are strapped for cash either consider it irrelevant, or not for the likes of them. And the more it is perceived to be for the better off, the less it will appeal to people further down the social spectrum.You canrsquot help wonderingthe wedding industry, as opposed to marriage itself, has created expectations that the hard-up simply cannot meet. With the average Scottish wedding now costing over a staggering pound,, this comes as no surprise. Increasingly the concept of marrying is bound up with the wedding. The status of the couple and their families is proclaimed by the nature of the ceremony, the wedding venue, and the sumptuousness of the reception. Not to mention stag and hen weekends and parties beforehand.It takes at least a year, and usually a lot longer, to book, plan and save for the big day. Ultimately, though, what matters is not the trappings, but making the vows, whether in a religious setting, or a registry office. The seriousness of the bond lies in the couplersquos decision to commit to each other, not in any of the hoopla that follows. Perhaps it is time to separate the legal procedure from the carnival that follows, to consciously uncouple the act of union from this crippling cost.Yet the nub of the problem identied by CSJ is not marriage itself, but hardship. Those living on the bread line do not have the resources, and possibly donrsquot have the inclination, to get officially tied. Given the serious disadvantages suffered when they separate, the answer, surely, is not to coax iniduals into wedlock, asit were the panacea for all their ails, but to digny cohabiting couples and their offspring with the same legal safeguards and tax breaks as those who marry. Protecting the rights of children and parents ndash especially mothers, who commonly look after the kids once a relationship ends ndash would give them a financial safety-net. Many of the outcomes for youngsters described in this report ndash gang membership, criminality, mental and physical health issues ndash are as much the result of penury as the lack of a piece of paper supposedly binding their parents forever.If it is to retain its meaning, marriage has to be a personal choice, not a virtuous act that deserves a reward. It can be done cheaply and quietly, as I can testy, or with terric fanfare, or it can be avoided altogether. Either way, in an enlightened world those in long-term relationships, and couples with children, should be treated by government in exactly the same way as the married. Until that day ndash far off, I fear ndash the gulf between the haves and the have nots will steadily deepen, eroded by a judgemental, moralising and, as wersquove too often seen, hypocritical state.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

Tory commentators and many MPs are deeply dischuffed with Mr Johnson, and not just because his Government made an even worse cock-up of the exams than the Scottish Government. Negotiations resumed this week over the withdrawal agreement with the European Union, and it is safe to say that expectations among the Conservative faithful are not high.Indeed, Brexiter Tory MPs, like Iain Duncan Smith, fully expect a sell-out. They think Mr Johnson is preparing to accept a whole range of EU regulations even after we have left. This means no trade deals with free market America, no state aid to key industries, no low tax havens and a ldquobetrayal of fishing.Tory MPs hoped that Boris would be tough on immigration, would cut taxes and rein back bureaucracy, while tackling political correctness and the nanny state. What they got was a bicycling PM who seems to be tough on motorists, not illegals. He has adopted what the Spectator columnist Christopher Snowden, calls ldquopurse-lipped, micro-managing, finger-wagging, lemon-sucking, censorious, anti-business, killjoy policies like the campaigns on obesity and sugar.Not in their wildest dreams did true blue Tories expect their chosen one to increase public spending by more than any Labour government since . Yet, this Government is currently paying the wages of half the working population through furlough, benefits and public sector employment. UK debt is now pound trillion. Thank God Margaret Thatcher is not alive to see it.Mr Johnson hasnrsquot even delivered on scrapping HS, the fast rail line that most Tory MPs think is a white elephant. Instead, he is fantasising about building bridges between Scotland and Northern Ireland. Yet that is not going to keep the Union together. His Brexit deal, it is now clear, has created a gulf between the UK and Northern Ireland.The province has remained in regulatory alignment with the European Unionrsquos single market, which means that there must be the very border checks the PM promised would never happen. Worse, it has handed the SNP a genuine grievance: being denied access to markets with which Northern Ireland can trade seamlessly.Tories are appalled by Mr Johnsonrsquos lack of urgency on Scotland as support for independence grows. The former Tory leader, William Hague, said this week thatthe PM doesnrsquot get his act together the UK will be finished within five years. Tories like Mr Hague think he allowed Nicola Sturgeon to play politics with the coronavirus.What they didnrsquot anticipate was the cack-handed and contradictory approach taken by the UK Government. At first, the lockdown seemed to appeal to the British wartime spirit, which always goes down well on the Right. But far from winning a victory over this viral enemy, Britain has recorded the worst excess death rate in Europe and now the deepest recession.Most Conservatives loath the imposition of masks, which the Daily Mail commentator, Peter Hitchens, calls ldquomuzzles, and which libertarians think are pointless impediments. Many Tory voters spend their holidays in France and the letters columns are full of people complaining about being forced back to Blighty even from regions of France where Covid is almost non-existent.Yet this Conservative Government kept Britainrsquos airports open during the worst phase of the pandemic, allowing  million travellers to come to Britain largely unchecked, including a number from Covid hot spots like Italy and China. And donrsquot even mention track and trace.The exams debacle was the final straw. Tory MPs want the head of the Education Secretary, Gavin Williamson, on a plate for his chaotic U-turn, but the real criticism is of the Prime Minister. He should surely have seen this coming after the chaos in Scotland. It seems to many asMr Johnson isnrsquot really in charge.His presentation has been lamentable, and even is greatest fans are disappointed with his bumbling delivery and lack of grip. He was never a detail man, and everyone knew he flew by the seat of his pants ndash thatrsquos when he managed to keep them on.Conservatives are pretty forgiving to politicians who think like they do, have the same instincts on nation and values. What is especially damaging is a growing sense that Mr Johnson is just not really a Conservative at all. They expected him to take a tough line with the statue topplers and culture warriors of Black Lives Matters. But instead of banging heads, he avoided confrontation and made only a routine condemnation of vandalism. He allowed Winston Churchill himself to be boxed up in Parliament Square. How could it come to this Part of the problem, I think, is that many Conservatives believed what Labour said about Mr Johnson ndash that he was a bit of a racist, misogynist, homophobic right winger. The most ldquoright-wing prime minister in British history as Labourrsquos John Mc Donnell called him. This he never was.Colourful phrases about Burqa-wearers looking like letter boxes does not a white supremacist make. When he was London mayor, he was careful to keep the black and ethnic community onside and he used to lead LGBT marches wearing a pink stetson. When he became PM he installed more BAME ministers than all previous UK governments combined. You wont hear Mr Johnson using Daily Mail rhetoric about immigrants, he genuinely believes in state intervention and he is quietly a bit of a Europhile. Far from being a free market ideologue, Boris Johnson is a liberal, patrician Tory ndash more like Michael Heseltine, Brexit aside, than Margaret Thatcher.The final insult was this Tory Prime Minister ennobling Claire Fox, a former Revolutionary Communist who used to support the objectives of the IRA. That was the final straw. As the Tory commentator Brian Monteith put it, many Conservatives now feel that they ldquovoted Boris and got Corbyn.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

Politicians need to be honest and accept that Covid is a fact of le like cancer, heart disease, stroke and the many other illnesses that kill hundreds of Scots each week ndash for these we take proportionate measures to tackle them, but not measures that cause far more long-term harm than good.The continued refusal of Ms Sturgeon to have a truly adult,not dficult, conversation about our future shows she is not fit to lead us forward ndash that she is by design consigning tens of thousands of people to the unemployment scrap heap  her partys call to extend furlough is a thinly veiled acceptance of that. By definition, every action by Ms Sturgeon to introduce local lockdown or worse directly harms our economy and the future of every person reading this, be that the letime earnings of a young person, the chances of ever being re-employed for someone older or the worth of a pension for someone retired.Our politicians are causing more harm than good by refusing to make genuinely tough decisions.

Whilst I do not wish to impose unnecessary authoritarianism, the numbers failing to comply with the law is now getting out of hand, and pleas to use common sense are falling on deaf ears. Steps need to be taken to prevent people without good and veriable cause for not wearing a mask from entering shops and malls.I accept that this may be harder for small shops to apply, but at least supermarkets and shopping malls with security staff need to implement a no mask, no entry rule. To make things easier, free masks or masks at nominal cost could be available upon entry.It only takes one inidual to unwittingly cause a catastrophe.

But hold on! Is this really because they are women  Irsquom not a massive fan of generalisations because they lead to stereotypes. I mean, Irsquom a woman who takes an hour to decide what to watch on Netflix, who stares in food-envy at fellow-dinersrsquo meal choices in restaurants, and who, more than once, has been told to remove my rose-tinted specs.Whilst it does look as though countries with female leaders, on the whole, were quicker to lock-down and have been more risk averse when it comes to peoplersquos lives ndash Germany, New Zealand, and Taiwan come to mind as having had far fewer Covid deaths than male-led countries such as the US, Brazil, UK or India, it doesnrsquot explain male-led countries like Greece, for example where Covid deaths remained relatively low.Who can forget Boris Johnsonrsquos ill-fated declaration that hersquod been to a hospital where there were coronavirus patients and he had shaken everyonersquos hand. In the Philippines, which had one of the worst coronavirus outbreaks in south east Asia, President Duterte told police and military to take matters into their own hands when dealing with lockdown breakers: ldquoShoot them dead...Do you understand  Dead. None of these are words we could imagine tumbling from current women leadersrsquo mouths.Instead, women like Jacinda Ardern, Angela Merkel and, latterly, after an arguable initial hesitancy, Nicola Sturgeon, have taken a more active listening approach. Taking advice from experts, collaborating with colleagues and, importantly, keeping the ego firmly in check, these leaders were honest and clear from the start. Whilst many world leaders were playing the threat down, Merkel told Germans that % of the population might be affected and that it would be Germanyrsquos biggest challenge since the Second World War.Ardernrsquos early motto was: ldquoWe must go hard and we must go early. In January, in Taiwan, President Tsai Ing-Wen introduced strict travel restrictions and quarantine controls for passengers entering from high-risk areas, resulting in just under  deaths in a country of nearly  million. But despite my strong impulse to declare womanhood to be the reason for this, the truth is maybe a little more prosaic. Perhaps being women simply predisposes them to having certain qualities required for good leadership ndash strong communication skills, empathy, honesty and trust. The aforementioned men are just sadly lacking in those.Leaders who were more risk averse at the thought of many deaths and who therefore took decisions to shut down whole economies will now be tested as economies begin to open up again. The criticism is that they have not been risk averse when it comes to the damage they have done to their economies.But it looks like the gamble to close down hard and fast in the hope that less damage might be done to the economy might just pay off. Germanyrsquos economy appears to be recovering and schemes like the Kurzarbeit programme, which allows workers to work reduced hours instead of being laid off, is expected to be extended by Merkel for  months to bring stability for workers, which the end of the UKs furlough scheme may not.In Scotland, Sturgeon is calling for furloughing to be extended, whilst clamping down on clusters of the virus and rule-breakers like a tough headmistress. In New Zealand, a quick economic recovery has been put on hold by Arden as she locks down again to eliminate, rather than simply contain, the virus. It will take nerves of steel for any leader, regardless of gender, to seethis particular strategy pays off.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

This was allegedly a conspiracy to deprive an innocent man of his liberty for political ends.In Scotland, I believe ndash and I am sure that others might correct meI am wrong ndash that the name of the crime in question is \"conspiring to defeat the ends of justice\", in this case by colluding to accuse Mr Salmond of crimes he did not commit.Such a conspiracy and its associated allegations of perjury are very serious indeed and can quite rightly lead to long custodial sentences. This case is in no way comparable with the tawdry machinations that occur within a political party.

When it was rising, interest rates were increased to discourage borrowing and encourage saving thereby reducing the money supply in the system to buy goods and services. The result was prices stabilised and any increases were modest.The converse of that scenario is a reduction in interest rates to encourage spending and investment, which is where we are today. The theory is profit and wealth will be generated to preserve jobs, create new ones through investment and pay down the exceptionally high level of debt resulting from the Covid- epidemic. However, it does not appear to be working.Although base rate is at an all-time low of .%, Bank of England statistics indicate that depositorsrsquo balances are at a record high. Why is this the case The answer is the prevailing climate of fear in the marketplace with members of the public building cash reserves as an insurance against possible loss of employment and companies reluctant to invest in uncertain times.Interest rate policy has been found wanting in the current economic conditions and alternative solutions are now being explored.Lindsay Walker, Strachur.Winning methodsIN his letteron the ways in which noted scholars exercised their discretion in affording passes to students, Iain MacInnes does well to highlight the modus operandi of Professor Magnus Macleanin ensuring students were encouraged to strive harder, or, where circumstances required, to avoid further slippage.It was on Macleanrsquos recommendation also that Reith took his honeymoon in the Parish of Minginish of the professors own forebears in Skye in June  and the future Lord High Commissioner to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland walked with his new bride, Muriel Odhams, from their hotel at Sligachan to the small church at Carbost, where they found the service was in Gaelic.

The Prince of Darkness is not renowned for making concessions. Irsquom sure both Mr Gove and Mr Galloway will forgive meI suggest that, for some, the identity of Auld Nick in this esoteric coupling may be subject to perpetual speculation.The Twitter alliance of these seemingly irreconcilable political foes has been born of mounting Unionist fears over the break up of the United Kingdom. Two more opinion polls this week continued an extended recent trend in favour of independence with one indicating an all-time high of % for Yes.Mr Gove, unofficial minister for the Union Jack in Boris Johnsonrsquos hard-right cabinet, has thus been seeking cross-party allies for what is likely to be Britainrsquos last imperial battle. According to the London Times, he has already held discussions with Lord McConnell of Glenscorrodaleand Danny Alexander, the former Liberal-Democrat chief secretary to the Treasury.When Mr Galloway, leader of the Workers Party of Great Britain, suggested this week that the ldquo, Scots living where in the UK must have a vote in the second referendum on independence Mr Gove replied ldquointeresting question. Mr Galloway at least possesses that rare commodity in British politics: principles.He might well have enjoyed a stellar career near the top of British politics were it not for his habit of reminding assorted Labour leaders how to spell S-O-C-I-A-L-I-S-T. Presumably, hersquoll defend his present dalliance with Mr Gove, a man who once apologised for participating in a strike, on the grounds that nationalism in whatever form is the enemy of international socialism. Butyour beliefs drive you into a camp led by one who has built his career abjuring everything you hold to be dear then perhaps you might ask yourself what it was you thought you were fighting for all this time.Mr Goversquos fireside chats with the laird of Glencorrosdaleare much easier to understand. Lord McConnell and his brother Labour barons were chiefly responsible for reducing Labour in Scotland to its current status of Holder of the Jaikets. In this wretched period the party has come to be defined not by its commitment to the communities that once nurtured it but by its alliance with the Conservative and Unionist Party.Irsquom also intrigued by Mr Gallowayrsquos late attempt to gerrymander the boundaries for a future referendum. In the six years since the last independence referendum Unionists have cited the ldquopeople of Scotland in their claims of a once-in-a-generation event.

As Irsquove suggested previously, we are living in abnormal times when the usual scrutiny of a partyrsquos domestic policy record has been suspended. And be in no doubt, when the second independence referendum does begin the British state will deploy every artice and lever at its disposal to maintain Westminster rule.Itrsquos now apparent, though, that the Yes cause is building momentum over a prolonged period of time. It would be tempting to ascribe this merely to Nicola Sturgeonrsquos lsquopresentationalrsquo skills and Boris Johnsonrsquos lack of them. Certainly, it would be foolish not to acknowledge that the First Ministerrsquos leadership has been a factor in the recent numbers for independence. If you can trust the nationrsquos leader when a pandemic threatens your existence then trusting her when she makes the economic and cultural cause for independence would not seem to be the massive leap it was in .There is something  at play here. Itrsquos become clear that from the lived experience of coronavirus has sprung a desire for profound and lasting societal change at many levels. One of the strongest suits of Better Together in  was the perception of stability. Many who had seriously considered voting for independence ultimately recoiled from taking a step into the unknown and a future uncertain. But when our immediate andlong-term future is wreathed in uncertainty the perceived risks of self-determination recede a little.During the five months of lockdown many have found that those institutions they once looked to for security and stability have let them down or revealed to have been a mirage. They have seen officials at the top of the Westminster Government recklessly disregard lockdown restrictions with impunity and disregard for the safety of the nation. They have come to discover that being locked out of Britainrsquos affluence means you are three times likelier to die of Covid- than those you entrusted with your health and wellbeing.From the outset of this pandemic they have witnessed the worst excesses of the capitalist system that gives oxygen to the forces now telling them to preserve the Union at any cost.

Viridorrsquos energy recovery facilities are the sophisticated combined heat and power plants which use non-recyclable waste as the fuel to generate low carbon electricity and heat.The event, From Vision to Reality ndash converting Scotlandrsquos Circular Economy Leadership into concrete action to ensure we Build Back Better, attracted stakeholders across the Scottish government, SEPA, Scottish Enterprise, Zero Waste Scotland, local government, business and academia.Viridor CEO Phil Piddington said that Viridor, with its history of recycling infrastructure investment in Scotland, was working to be a key partner in ensuring Scotland achieves its goals.The company is also preparing a planning application to East Lothian Council for a plastics recycling and reprocessing plant at Dunbar which would draw heat and power from the energy recovery facility ndash essentially putting waste to work to power the recycling of more plastic within the circular economy.Mr Piddington added: ldquoWe recognise that these goals cannot be achieved by any one organisation. Success lies in partnering across business, government, academia and inventors to ensure Scottish resources are used and reprocessed in Scotland before being ed to local businesses creating a more circular economy. These partnerships move us from ambition to the practical reality delivering real results for the country.Viridorrsquos Innovation and Regulation Director Tim Rotheray said the event created the opportunity for Scotlandrsquos key stakeholders to come together and debate what is needed to move the Scottish circular economy beyond ambition.Dr Rotheray said: ldquoWe welcome the opportunity to continue these discussions and examine issues, such as how regulation and policy can drive both an improved economy and better environment.ldquoOur vision to support Scotlandrsquos circular economy would also feature a dedicated Circular Economy Innovation Centre. This could be a testbed for universities, start-ups and Scottish business to develop solutions to eliminate waste, by tackling the hardest to recycle products and putting partnership at heart of the vision.He said Viridorrsquos vision for the Scottish Circular Economy and Innovation Park had been designed to deliver both resource and energy efficiency.In a recorded message to the event delegates, Her Royal Highness, The Princess Royal said she was delighted to help launch the Scottish Circular Economy and Innovation Park ndash ldquoan important and practical demonstration of what should be happening.She added that the discussions, bringing together all sectors of society to ensure recycling was seen for what it is ldquoa valuable resource and not just rubbish were to be applauded.ldquoI am encouraged to hear that, in these challenging times, this vision matches innovation and investment with job creation, giving our young people the opportunity to play a major role in the world they will inherit.Dr Rotheray said that key workers in recycling and waste management had performed an essential service during the COVID- pandemic and now, the sector that is so vital to driving a better environment, also had the ability to answer the demand to drive a greener recovery."},{"url":null,"title":"new-technology-orbital-marine-power-taps-potential-scottish-tidal-streams","story":"Orbital Marine Power Ltd, with offices in Edinburgh and Orkney, is a pioneer in the field with its unique technology under continuous engineering development, including testing of scaled systems in tank conditions and open ocean environments since the company was founded in .Recently it brought its breakthrough MW SR floating tidal turbine prototype programme in Orkney to a close to make way for the companyrsquos first commercial turbine iant ndash the MW O.The SR was arguably the most successful full-scale tidal prototype to date says chief executive officer Andrew Scott. ldquoA lot of great performance came out of that machine but it was a prototype and we knew from an early stage of development that there were improvements that we could make.ldquoThese include enhancements to the system from a yield perspective. Expanding the swept area of the turbine to a -metre rotor diameter means an almost an % increase on swept area on its predecessor. That has a big effect on reducing costs of electricity for the turbine, he adds.In October  Orbital opened a pound million crowd funding debenture on the London-based Abundance Investment  to support building the O, a m-long floating superstructure with two MW turbines at either side and a rated power output of MW.The technology, he says, is unique to Orbital Marine: ldquoMost people are familiar with the concept of an underwater wind turbine but from day one we saw a dferent solution, one thatrsquos more akin to constructing and anchoring a boat with the signicant cost and risk benefits that result from taking that approach.The first O, which will be operational next year, is being constructed in Dundee drawing on a supply chain that spans Scotland, the UK and Europe ndash with bearing systems from Sweden and Germany, anchors from Wales, composite rotors from England ndash but Scotland plays the leading role.Most of the turbine manufacture is being done by TEXO Fabrication in Dundee, with the fabrication process using steel from Liberty Steel Dalzell in Motherwell as well as utilising many of the traditional engineering and industrial capabilities within Scotland.Itrsquos something Scott is proud of. ldquoTidal stream energy has very much been a Scottish-led endeavour and thatrsquos logical given the industrial and engineering heritage we have here, from shipbuilding to oil and gas. itrsquos natural to seize the opportunity to ersy those skills into an industry with similar requirements and operations. And of course, we have a great tidal resource here too.And, he says, there are major opportunities in the export market. ldquoWe see an ever-growing global demand for the supply of low carbon energy solutions like our own. However, turning that into a sustainable job and wealth creating industry for the UK requires investment though, chiefly in the creation of a domestic market.ldquoServicing a domestic demand will allow the supply chain to entrench capabilities here in the UK such that we export turbine equipment and services and avoid exporting companies.ldquoStrategically, the UK should be looking to be at the forefront of this decarbonising revolution that is under way and including tidal stream as part of the mix is a no brainer. Itrsquos a win-win as far as wersquore concerned."},{"url":null,"title":"complacency-not-option-running-time-says-clare-foster-shepherd-wedderburn","story":"The Covid- pandemic has received   media coverage across the globe, and with good reason. Coronavirus has had a catastrophic impact, claiming the lives of hundreds of thousands of people, devastating our economies, and materially changing the lives of millions as we try to adapt to the profound societal changes it has inflicted.Many will vividly rememberwatching Boris Johnston tell the nation on March : ldquoCoronavirus is the biggest threat this country has faced for decades.While there is no doubt that the particular challenge posed by Covid- is unheard of in recent history, and should not be diminished, I would take issue with the Prime Ministerrsquos statement. There is another threat that has been looming for decades, which is exponentially greater than coronavirus and poses an existential threat to humanity.Yet the climate change threat is failing to attract the attention ndash and action ndash it deserves.To put it into context, as Sir David Attenborough said last year: ldquoThe scientic evidence is thatwe have not taken dramatic action within the next decade, we could face irreversible damage to the natural world and the collapse of our societies.This is a remarkable statement on a number of levels, but even more remarkable is the dference a year makes. The headlines about Greta Thunberg and Extinction Rebellionthat reverberated around the globe less than a year ago in the wake of the Australian bushfires and flooding in Venice feel like a distant memory, and governments and society have not reacted to climate change in the same way that they have to the Covid emergency.The coronavirus crisis has highlighted the ability of central banks, governments and agencies in multiple jurisdictions to move quickly, demonstrating that their inherent bureaucracy need not be a barrier to dynamic action when faced with an emergency of this scale.So why are we not treating climate change like the pandemic There are a number of reasons:From a UK business perspective, things need to change quickly to get the economy back on track, a point that is not lost on Chancellor Rishi Sunak. However, the UK simply cannotto le and business as usual.A green recovery is our best hope of rebuilding an economy ravaged by the Covid- pandemic and addressing the climate emergency. It should be a recovery focused on cutting emissions, investing in more sustainable, greener projects, creating jobs, and building a fairer and more resilient society.Why  Becausewe revert to the same bad habits that crept back in after the last financial crisis in then we will fulfil Attenboroughrsquos prophecy. The debate should not be whether the recovery should be green but rather how a green recovery is best achieved.It is important to remember it is not all doom and gloom, however. In the clean energy sector, eyes are firmly on a green recovery. There is huge appetiteto achieve the targets for offshore and onshore wind, as well as the other renewables technologies that will play a major part in helping us achieve the  and  net-zero targets set by the Scottish and UK governments respectively. The potential for job creation is enormous.In the financial sector, there is recognition that the funding requirements to achieve net zero are gigantic and that there needs to be a greater focus on investments that help tackle climate change. Recently, the Net Zero Investment Frameworkwas released for consultation.It provides the first practical blueprint for investors to maximise the contribution they make in tackling climate change and achieving net-zero emissions globally by . The framework focuses on the twin targets of decarbonising investment portfolios and increasing investment in climate solutions.The increasing importance of environmental, social and governancefactors and disclosure requirements means that sustainable investments are the way forward.Meanwhile, the oil and gas sector is playing its part too. At the beginning of August, BP announced its new strategy to transition to an integrated energy company and set out its net-zero ambition. It is the latest in a long list of oil and gas majors to have recognised that low carbon is the only viable future.Complacency is not an option and we are running out of time. The UK and Scottish governments have shown that when an emergency presents itself they are able to move at speed.If we are to try to address the climate emergency and the socio-economic effects of coronavirus with any chance of achieving the economic growth, employment and sustainable future required, we need to see that type of dynamic action again, not only from government but also from industry and society.

In truth, the famous thoroughfare had been leaching newspapers since the s but when Julie Welch landed a job there in , the presses were rolling at full tilt.Her entertaining new book describes the media epicentrersquos heyday, from the perspective of those whorsquod gained access to its hallowed newsrooms through talent and sheer hard graft ndash yet couldnrsquot even buy a drink in its most famous pub.Fleet Street Girls tells the story of ldquothe women who broke down the doors of the gentlemenrsquos club ndash not least, by winning a landmark discrimination case against the legendary El Vinorsquos refusal to serve women at the bar.As the first woman in Fleet Street to report on a football match, Welch was one of the conquistadors and the book combines her own recollections with those of journalistic luminaries such as Lynn Barber and Katharine Whitehorn. The result is a colourful evocation of the pre-digital and decidedly pre-MeToo culture that prevailed half-a-century ago, in fetid newsrooms where senior editors snoozed off liquid lunches amid clattering typewriters and rumbling subterranean presses.Welchrsquos largely anecdotal account is light on statistics, but itrsquos clear that for most of its history Fleet Street was a male preserve. Well, almost. In the late th century, Rachel Beer became the UKrsquos first female newspaper editor when she took over the reins of The Observer and later the Sunday Times.Assertive and fiercely intelligent, she was ldquoa woman with real power and therefore, writes Welch ldquoanathema to the staff and to distinguished contributors such as George Bernard Shaw, who became ldquospittle-flecked with rage when Beer made changes to his copy.She also engineered one of the greatest scoops in Fleet Street history, exposing the miscarriage of justice by which Jewish captain Alfred Dreyfus had been ly imprisoned for treason.Itrsquos not known whether Beer employed any women. There must have been some around because in , female hacks were being caricatured as sloppy, unreliable and deadline-shy in Arnold Bennettrsquos book, Journalism For Women. In a subsequent guide published three decades later, the author enthused about the ldquoenormous scope for female journalists, listing housework, fashion and ldquobeauty culture among the dazzling array of suitable topics.By the s, when the teenaged Julie Welch set her sights on a Fleet Street career, journalism remained male-dominated apart from a few dedicated ldquowomenrsquos pages. Lacking recourse to the copy boy apprenticeships that launched many male careers, Welch went to secretarial college to gain the typing and shorthand skills she hoped would get her a foothold.Astonishingly, to anyone familiar with todayrsquos sparsely-resourced newspaper offices, the rsquos history correspondent was advertising for a secretary. Although Welch didnrsquot get that job, her next application ndash for a clerical vacancy on the Observer sports desk ndash was successful. ldquoApparently there had only been one other applicant. She had a huge bust, so all the men said lsquoHire that onersquo.Thankfully, sports editor Clford Makins was more impressed by Welchrsquos track record. Having won the Daily rsquos Young Writer of the Year award as a student, shersquod been interviewed by Makinsrsquos old crony, Kingsley Amis. Nepotism was career currency on Fleet Street and mentioning the Lucky Jim author proved to be Welchrsquos lucky break.But name-dropping only gets you so far. Welch was an exceptional writer whoseprize ndash a job on the paper ndash had been scuppered by an unplanned pregnancy. Now that shersquod finally arrived in the ldquowonderful, human-sized board game that was Fleet Street, she used her talent and ingenuity to squeeze through the chinks in the bastionrsquos armoury.When she wasnrsquot phoning round pubs looking for writers whorsquod missed their deadlines or fielding calls from her bossrsquos many lovers, she was clocking up the occasional feature byline, eventually talking her editor into letting her cover a football match.ldquoWomen in the press box. So itrsquos come to that, muttered one of the assembled sports hacks, as she sat nervously waiting for the Coventry City v Tottenham Hotspur match to begin. ldquoThat was very good, said another, more kindly, after the whole pack had sat listening while she phoned over her report to the Observerrsquos copy-takers.Ah, copy-takers! Fleet Street Girls is full of gorgeous details about the newsroom paraphernalia of old. The overflowing ashtrays and huge typewriters on which copy was bashed out in carbon triplicate before being stuffed into tubes and sent to the machine room via overhead wires. The vicious metal spike on which unwanted copy was ldquostabbed to death. The libraries full of reference books and helpful staff.Innuendo and groping were perennial hazards. ldquoYou could almost smell the testosterone, recalls Wendy Holden of her time at the Evening Standard. Sly suspicions drted around any woman who achieved editorial status. Welch had won awards for her sports writing but when a football version of Private Eye was launched, she was horried to discover a comic strip titled Miss Julie. ldquoThere I was, caricatured, some of my most pretentious phrases lampooned, along with the implication that I slept with footballers. It was libellous, but I didnrsquot have the guts to call them out.Not all Fleet Street men were dinosaurs. The huge circulations of magazines like Honey and Cosmopolitan led many editors to try to ldquofeminise their papers and ldquoclear out the cobwebby old men. Meanwhile, Welch was grateful to the Observerrsquos Kilmarnock-born chief sports writer Hugh McIlvanney, whorsquod remind colleagues sore at being upstaged by a woman that ldquothe Lady can write most of us under the table.Welch clearly enjoyed being introduced by a radio DJ as ldquothe prettiest football reporter and writes fondly of an era when ldquoa young woman could charm her way out of speeding tickets. Nor were women alone in being disadvantaged. The prevailing Old Boy culture would have defeated most humbly-born males, and many of Welchrsquos interviewees were privately-schooled and well-connected. ldquoAwful, says Katharine Whitehorn of an early job on Womanrsquos Own. ldquoI had to interview girls in factories.For all the pressure to be ldquotwice as good as our male peers, Welch writes gleefully of the Fleet Street Girlsrsquo determination to ldquogo anywhere the men did, report anything hellip so that we too could make decisions about what went into our papers.And despite the groping, sexism and exhausting pace of work, it was, she suggests, a golden era. ldquoLove, fame, laughter, money, excitement were all there for the taking and we knew that once we left Fleet Street nothing would ever be so naughty, thrilling, so ground-breaking again.As newsrooms empty and more and more journalists toil remotely at laptops for ever-diminishing s, itrsquos hard to disagree."},{"url":null,"title":"kevin-bridges-joins-plea-save-glasgows-stand-comedy-club","story":"Labelling Glasgows The Stand as the \"best comedy club\" he called for the Scottish Government to support the recovery of the comedy venue.Earlier we reported the Stands venues in Glasgow, Edinburgh and Newcastle were on verge of collapse after running up a pound, loss during the lockdown.:Flat in popular seaside town could be yours for poundKDirector Eva Mackay revealed the clubs are in need of urgent support in an email to supporters.Kevin took to social media to support the cause and plea for funding.He revealed he got his start at The Stand over  years ago.He wrote: \"Eva, Jane, Tommy etc helped me develop all the way through my career and itrsquos still the best comedy club in the UK.

Unlike student nurses and midwives, however, those training to be a paramedic are not eligible for a bursary, despite being unable to take up part time work.  To add insult to injury, their counterparts in England do receive bursaries.“This lack of a level playing field risks putting off those we need to see coming into our health service.  The current arrangements do little to encourage young people to pursue a career as a paramedic and store up problems for the future.“When I wrote to the Health Secretary recently on behalf of a constituent, I was told the government has no plans to review the funding options for trainee paramedics. Today, Nicola Sturgeon said she would look into the matter, having also been approached by a young constituent, angry at the unequal treatment.“The First Minister needs to recognise that introducing a bursary scheme would make a real dference, not least in widening access to the profession.  It’s time the Scottish Government properly recognised the dedication of our trainee paramedics by putting them on the same footing as trainee nurses and midwives.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

On the Pentland Firth, people are still being forced to pay over the odds.“COVID has inevitably created challenges, but even prior to the pandemic there seemed to be little urgency from the Scottish Government to deliver on its promise.

Cànan, ‘S na DaoineNow there is much within the machinations that occupy the precious time of our Comhairle officers that could well be regarded as relatively ‘trivial’, although I will fully concede that even the most improbable deliberations might well form the centre of somebody’s entire universe.But when we, as a community, or section of that community, continue to press for answers and resolutions to a subject that has already been explained fully to us, then we should ask ourselves one important question: “Are we doing this for the greater good, or because we are trying to promote our own agenda ”. about some of the material that was included in the Scottish Government’s RSHPguidelines and how I felt that some of it was completely over the top for inclusion in any classroom.Several concerned parents had written to me, asking what on earth was going on.I enquired of both the Director and Chair of Education and Children’s Services as to the validity of these concerns.I was happy to note that the ‘plot’ wasn’t as sinister as had been portrayed by some ‘concerned’ groups both within the counciland on anti-social media.Some alleged that the Comhairle were somehow, through the back-door and under the cover of the Covid- crisis , trying to sneak through an agenda which went against the “moral values of this community”.An inflammatory accusation, one that was sure to ignite passions and ring yet another Pavlovian bell.Except that, far from being subject matter that was about to get rammed down our children’s throats, not just ‘promoted’ it was simply an extreme example of what was included for reference, should anyone wish to avail themselves of it.Yes, some of it was fairly graphic stuff and, as I’ve said before, I was hugely alarmed that it was even considered for anything to be found in our classrooms.But, as is the case with material which has been taught in our schools for at least a couple of centuries the devil is in the detail .Luckily we have seen teachers, historically, opt to use the message of love, forgiveness, compassion and mutual understanding from this particular tome ignoring the more sinister aspects where death, retribution, punishment and all kinds of nastiness are very much front and centre.Choosing your testaments wisely is what this is primarily about.We are lucky to have an educational framework where common sense prevails, otherwise there could be very many distractions in the subjects of Biology, Geology and quite possibly Physics.I attempted to be amusing about a topic which has very legitimate, obvious, and serious, implications for our most impressionableyoung people.I hoped I was taking a cue from people who think that a banana dipped into a jar of Nutella is a suitable metaphor for something.Possibly the obesity crisis I think a jar of Bovril might have been funnier.If people wish to identy as a Unicorn and have sex with the pavement, then that’s fine too, but not surely for inclusion in ‘guidance’ material.Yes, I have to admit that I also jumped onto the bandwagon, until I had the situation clearly explained to me and was told to trust the teacher’.They will be given the ultimate discretion and they know best what’s appropriate for their young audience.We do ‘much ado’ well here.When ‘Ironside’ and ‘Bob the Budget Builder’ steered the Comhairle and helped many local businesses through the worst of the effects of the ongoing pandemic, we turned inward and focused on upholstery.With Bernie, Angus and the Education Department, all under immense pressure to get a hugely problematic school year underway on time, we are more focused on what won’tbe getting taught, rather than what will, and how.Andour kids come home from school with a penchant for strange combinations of fruit and nut sandwiches, then it will have been discussed with the Head Teacher and Parent Council first.A lot of the contentious issues which occupy us here in the Western Islesare perceived to exist somewhere between a conservative, culturally protective, radically Christian, ‘right’, and a somewhat more progressive, more liberal, secular, bunch of left-wing snowflakes.Most of us are somewhere, far more certainly and squarely, in the middle trying to make sense of it all.If we cannot empower and trust our teachers to do what’s best for the most vulnerable amongst us, then we will have failed both.The man of the week, last week, certainly in the northern half of this county, was the irrepressible David Black.Three rounds crammed into  hours saw him claim the Thompson Bruce Trophy at Stornoway and take an early lead in Scarista’s  ‘Blue-Riband’ event.Rounds of +  around Lady Lever Park on Friday and Saturday saw him edge out Eddie Rogers,  +  by just a single shot over  holes.A further shot adrt saw Murdo ‘Griddy’ MacLeod,  +  in third slot.Iain ‘Juke Box’ MacKay won the handicap trophy with two excellent rounds of nett  for a  total.In between his Thompson Bruce exploits, Davie also posted the leading score in the, two-round, Harris G.C. Club Championship.His  was  shots ahead of nearest challengers, Billy Fraser and Cal Robertson, both on .Starting with six straight pars, he succumbed to bogies at the ‘amen’ of corners, the deadly-deceiving brace of par-s at   .Naturally he bounced straight back birdies at the new th, and the th brought him back to level.He swapped a birdie for a bogey at  and  to see him home safely.Only a sht in plate tectonics will see him throw away this lead.Midweek at Stornoway saw the Glennie Trophy claimed by Iain Moir on  Stableford Points. Starting his opening four holes, five-over par, couldn’t have been good for his confidence.He was just one-over for the next .In the Junior section, Calum Gbounced back from his recent humblings at the hands of brother, Geordie H in the Par Bogey competition.Six ahead of the course, he demolished the rest of the field by  clear shots.In the Scarista midweek competition, Billy Fraser kept up his, season-long, decent form, partnering Chris Sutton to a fine win in the Pairs Greensomes.Their  was two ahead of Russell Tennant and Alan Gunn’s, .Benbecula’s finest continue to battle it out for their season-long Order of Merit, Dami Steele ing a semblance of normality, bouncing back from a week out of the top spots to consolidate his lead at the top.His round wasn’t, however, good enough to claim the full points last Tuesday evening, Domhnall MacKay storming to a -pointer and the maximum Point haul.Apparently Donald has been keeping his powderdry and intends, after a decent sabbatical, to make a strong charge over the coming weeks."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/TOURISM-2-copy.jpg","title":"litir do luchd ionnsachaidh","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine.’.

The rest were reduced by a single grade and she has missed out on As in English, Biology and Modern Studies, as well as a C in Higher Chemistry.Eva said to have her grades knocked down so signicantly has made her “completely reconsider her career path”.Exams were cancelled this year because of Covid- and replaced with estimated grades based on past attainment, and the school’s previous exam record.The modelling system adapted by the Scottish Qualications Authority reduced the grades of around , results, with analysis suggesting youngsters from poorer backgrounds and historically poorer performing schools suffered disproportionately.In her letter, shared almost , times on Twitter, Eva said that “it was clear” that her grades had been signicantly adjusted “because I go to a school classed as underperforming”.Her letter calls for the system, which she describes as discriminatory, to be urgently investigated, adding: “The government has been pushing the ‘no wrong path slogan’ but why should pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds and deprived areas be forced into a pathway they didn’t want and worked tirelessly to avoid”.Eva had been predicted in her fourth year to achieve  As and two Cs at national five level, but in her exams she improved to come out with five As and a B.She added that her school’s recent performance had been affected by staff shortages.She had stayed behind after school for extra tuition, aiming to secure a university place and a career in the field of medicine.“Any further efforts by pupils to achieve higher grades in schools which have historically underperformed has been disregarded, she added.“SQA results this year have been more about fitting the statistical trends than the inidual pupil.”According to the Scottish Government#s own statistics, the estimated . per cent of most deprived pupils who would have expected an A-C band at Higher was lowered to . per cent by the SQA#s moderation system.

But what of other aspects What of community resilience, something I suspect will barely register as a priority for most us when deciding on our weekly shop It may be the case that more people will try and grow more of their own food and local produce will, hopefully, be in greater demand.All very welcome. But what’s really needed is a completely fresh approach to our behaviour as consumers.As the pound in our pocket becomes ever more stretched we need to value it in terms of what benefit it can bring to the wider collective # who can it support, what should it support and how can that can bring about greater resilience within our own communities.It’s not radical or revolutionary. It’s just about taking a bit more time and effort to think about where best to spend our cash, especially when it comes to our most basic of needs.It can’t possibly make sense to get your Sunday roast from the supermarketthe same cut of meat is available at your local butcher at a comparable price . And especiallythat butcher has sourced his meat from the crofter down the road.It takes a bit of extra effort to call in at the butcher, for sure, but add in important elements like food miles and provenance and there really is no excuse, except for our own inherent laziness.It has always amazed me how there is any fish at all on the shelves of supermarkets in this part of the world when the local fishmongers offer far higher quality at a lower price.And, in any case, it’s now perfectly possible to buy direct from the fisherman, with many of them now offering sales to the public.That may have come about through the closure of their overseas markets during lockdown, but what better example of necessity being the mother of invention.If west-coast prawns were coveted by sophisticated palates on the Mediterranean, then they should be more than adequate for consumption a bit closer to home.It’s not that long ago that our communities were completely self-reliant in food.We do demand a more discerning choice these days # no-one would want toto a diet made up entirely of fish, mutton and potatoes.But, with an abundance of quality produce on our own doorstep, surely it makes sense to take more advantage of that and in the process create greater community resilience through sourcing from independent, local retailers.If there’s a downside to that approach, I fail to see it.ONE aspect that looks certain to change, certainly for the foreseeable, is that there will be less air travel.Through the lockdown it is estimated that carbon emissions have been reduced by over  per cent by planes being grounded alone.That’s not even taking account of reductions in car journeys and it is a staggering figure from just one simple change.There are certain elements in the environmental lobby who would have you believe that methane emissions from cattle make a signicant contribution to climate change.Never mind that bovineshave roamed the land for thousands of years without causing much harm.Never mind that it’s only the last  or  years, as our economy became ever reliant on fossil fuels, that the damage to our planet has been made.The reduction in air travel will be for economic, more than environmental, reasons.But the staggering statistics of these last few months should at least mean that when it comes to a real determination in tackling environmental damage the finger of blame will be pointed in the right direction.Then again, maybe cows are a much easier target."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3301349.jpg--.jpg?1597840898000\n","title":"cullybckey volunteers praised","story":"Volunteers from Cullybackey Community Partnershipwere presented with a certicate from Mayor Councillor Peter Johnston recently to recognise their efforts during this Covid- pandemic.CCP volunteers stepped up to the mark through a number of dferent initiatives to help those most vulnerable in the area in recent months.One of those was the delivery of food parcels to those both in the village and those in outlying rural areas.

An employee at Danske Bank was even disinfecting a cash machine. People had a mixed reaction to the tightened guidelines, and whether the PSNI can or will enforce them.Judith Dickson from the town said she was worried about the rise in Covid- cases in the area but said it#s all our own fault.I think the guidelines will be enforcedthey can andthe police have the manpower, but I don#t think they do, she said. It#s up to people to report it but I don#t think they will.Gavin McCandless, who lives on the outskirts of the town, felt the temporary measures were necessary to keep everyone safe.Meanwhile, Sam Cree, who said he had the virus as far back as January, was in no doubt that a second wave was on its way.After developing a dry cough and losing his sense of taste and smell, Mr Cree was convinced he contracted Covid- but said he has fully recovered.He added that Mr Swann was correct in bringing down the gathering restrictions but was not impressed with the number of people visiting pubs.I just think there will be a second wave and people will have to learn to wear their masks going into shops, he said.Charlotte Weir and her friend Beverley Connor were much more critical of Stormont#s politicians and the PSNI in how they have handled the virus. Are there even enough police to stretch themselves that far and land at people#s doors  Charlotte asked. I just don#t think the politicians have a clue what they#re doing anymore to be honest.Beverley said: I don#t think there#s a chance the police will come in and enforce everything. There#s not enough of them.Bridget Mullen criticised the new lockdown measures and felt that allowing six people into your home is nowhere near as bad as staging a wedding with  to  people.I think the younger people are more lackadaisical because they don#t think it will affect them, she added.

The ruling came in legal challenges by two victims - including Jenner McNern,- to the continued impasse around introducing the scheme with an estimated cost of £mAugust   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailThey lost legs, arms or their eyesight, but the victims who gathered outside Belfast High Court never lost heart.Yesterday, their long and exhausting years of struggle finally paid off as a judge declared that The Executive Office had unlawfully refused to advance their pension scheme.Justice McAlinden delivered a scathing ruling that surely made Sinn Fein squirm.Every legal argument advanced on behalf of Deputy First Minister Michelle O#Neill was demolished.Arrant nonsense, a truly shocking proposition, wilful disregard for the rule of law, or abject ignorance of whatmeans in a democratic society were just some of the terms used.How on earth did the party get it legally, politically and morally so wrong  Why fight a battle that you#re destined to lose in both a court of law and the court of public opinion  There was never going to be any other outcome.O#Neill has now agreed to nominate a department and progress the scheme. This embarrassing climbdown forced by the courts could have been avoided.Why did the Deputy First Minister not just do what she was legally obliged to do months ago  She could have saved victims so much additional trauma.You#d expect Sinn Fein to at least be PR savvy. The very powerful images of men and women in wheelchairs, or with white sticks, going into court at the start of the case, should have caused a serious rethink in the party.It argues that the pension scheme discriminates against former republican prisoners. It could have pursued that issue while allowing those who have suffered the most to apply for and receive the pension they#re entitled to.The Shinners were completely isolated on this one at Stormont and beyond. A section of their own base was certainly put out by the scheme#s criteria, but it was by no means a matter which incensed or roused the entire republican community. This wasn#t a nationalist versus unionist issue. The victims behind this legal action were from all sections of the community.There were plenty of people who support justice for the Bloody Sunday families, who believe the state committed many great wrongs over the years, who still wanted the pension paid.As well as Jenner McNern#s legal challenge, a case was also brought by Brian Turley, one of the #Hooded Men# subjected to inhuman and degrading treatment by the British Army in .As a survivor of torture, I was left with long-term injuries as a result of the actions of the state, he said yesterday.The delay in having to wait on my right to a pension can only be described as another form of torture. Turley said O#Neill had no right to stop the pension scheme and described her action as very unprofessional.Words like that wound Sinn Fein. When the party finds itself on the opposite side to a victim of state violence like him it should know that it#s on shaky ground. Negotiations will continue between Stormont and Downing Street over who foots the pensions# bill. Naomi Long#s Justice Department will now be designated to progress the scheme.

But maybe after Mondaywe should have looked at it again.There were voices insisting, however, that the Oireachtas Golf Society#s half-century had to be marked.There was also the fact that the family of the late Mark Killilea, a former MEP and founder member of the society, had been invited.\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news republic-of-ireland df .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_de-d-f-aaf-_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news republic-of-ireland df .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_de-d-f-aaf-_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news republic-of-ireland df .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_de-d-f-aaf-_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news republic-of-ireland df .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_de-d-f-aaf-_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news republic-of-ireland df .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_de-d-f-aaf-_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClose\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news republic-of-ireland df .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_de-d-f-aaf-_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news republic-of-ireland df .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_de-d-f-aaf-_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news republic-of-ireland df .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_de-d-f-aaf-_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news republic-of-ireland df .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_de-d-f-aaf-_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news republic-of-ireland df .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_de-d-f-aaf-_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Dara Calleary PA FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappDara Calleary Dara Calleary was a political protégé of Mr Killilea, and a friend.The source said: Dara doesn#t know the first thing about golf.

We weren#t allowed to take the pin out of the hole to putt, we weren#t allowed to use the showers after the golf. We weren#t allowed to change in the changing rooms. All of these rules applied all of the time, added the politician.No drinks were served in the clubhouse without an accompanying order of food, as required under Covid rules.

It comes after this week’s A-level results changes that mean many students will be awarded higher teacher assessed grades. As a result universities will have to offer additional places with Queens University Belfastsaying it may need up to , extra. That will necessitate the lting of the maximum student numberscap. However, at yesterdays Economy Committee meeting at Stormont, Derry MLAs Gary Middleton and Sinead McLaughlin raised concerns thatthe correct decisions arent made it could lead to further regional imbalance with more students enrolling in Belfast courses. googletag.cmd.push DUP MLA Gary Middleton said there are several hundred unfilled places at Magee. While, SDLP MLA Sinead McLaughlin said thatUlster University wants to see growth at Magee it has to be engineered through the relocation of courses and the university has to invest in the marketing of the campus. The Department for the Economycontrols the number of undergraduate places available at QUB and Ulster Universityfor students from NI and those from outside the UK. Both institutions are allowed to accept between ,-, new undergraduates from Northern Ireland every year The cap exists in Northern Ireland in order to keep tuition fee costs down but results in huge competition for places. googletag.cmd.push It also means that on some courses NI students are expected to get higher grades than their counterparts applying from Great Britain. Derry politicians have called for the MaSN cap to be lted to allow universities to accommodate more students. They’ve insisted that the Magee campus should be prioritised, citing long-promised expansion to , students. However, it is courses that will determine demand and in turn additional places. A UU spokesperson said that it envisages increased demand for Magee courses such as Computer Sciences, Articial Intelligence and Personalised Medicine. She commented: “At Ulster University, students are our absolute priority and we will be as flexible as possible in order to accommodate the maximum number of students possible within our existing funding and the additional flexibility already provided by Department for the Economy. “We are actively preparing for the anticipated additional demand by building in additional places for some of our most popular courses including Computer Sciences, Articial Intelligence, Engineering, Law, Accounting, and Personalised Medicine. “To avail of these additional places, we urge students to contact us as soon as possible on    to discuss your options with an advisor.” The DfE pointed out that responsibility for MaSN allocation lies with Higher Education institutions. A spokesperson for the DfE said: “Until the local universities have received access to the full range of revised grades for all applicant students, they will not be able to confirm places for students or otherwise. “As such, until this process has been completed, there is no way of assessing the number of any additional HE places there may be, nor what the impact might be for each HE institution with regards to their respective MaSNs.” She added: “With regards to the MaSN cap, it is allocated on an institutional-level basis and relates to all full-time undergraduate NI and EU domiciled students it is for each institution to decide how to allocate its MaSN across both subject areas and campuses. “The Economy Minister has stated thatshe will be working with Executive colleagues to ensure that additional places and extra resources are put in place to support universities as soon as possible. “Enrolments for previous years are available athttps:www.economy-ni.gov.uk articles higher-education-enrolments”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

There were plenty of smiles, but despite the blistering sunshine, the atmosphere was slightly muted. In any normal year there would have been giddy excitement, pupils slapping congratulations into each others backs. But this is education in a pandemic. The Class of  have already missed out on so much. Their final year was abruptly cut short in March, with the footballers of St Patricks on the brink of a MacRory Cup Final. From March until June in your final year of school may be peak time for exam cramming, but its also a coming-of-age period for young students. googletag.cmd.push Relationships with staff gradually takes on a more collegial feel. There is almost a feeling of being in the trenches together as they prepare together for the exams. Amid our A-Levels, myself and a friend were, not particularly diligently, preparing for a History exam that was set to take place the following day. We had nipped into the shop on the way up from Coleraine town centre and bought a sticky toffee pudding on a whim. The product required heating. Mr Bob Murphy was the most likely to do the needful for us, but when he took a look at the pair of us outside the staff room, he was exasperated. googletag.cmd.push “Boys, this is Mrs McGoldricks exam..” he began. We explained that we were grand for the exam, but would he mind heating up our dessert for us  He came back with a smile and a shake of the head, but with a freshly warmed pudding in hand. Trivial, farcical moments like that are recalled much more easily than any time spent in the exam hall, but s pupils have been denied both academic and pastoral build-up to these milestone exams. They have been disenfranchised, denied ownership of what, in many cases, is a le-changing four months. You cant cram for an exam that isnt happening. Every teacher and school leader Ive spoken to over the last week has highlighted the March to June period as a key moment in exam preparation. Pupils look at how things are going, andthe picture doesnt look great, they know its time to up the ante. Its the sprint at the end of the marathon. Principal Mrs Brenda Mussen addresses the St Patricks College, Maghera, Class of . Weirs decision yesterday afternoon to revert back to teacher predictions on AS and A results is a welcome move, but one that should have come without a four-day delay. The algorithm that would have decided the immediate future of our young people was particularly harsh on comprehensive schools. To use just the previous two years as a benchmark was unfair, particularly given the huge range in results a mixed ability cohort can throw up in any given year. Given the nature of academic selection, the risk of having a below-par set of results in a grammar school is greatly reduced, meaning the system used is already subject to in-built injustice. Results are now back in the hands of teachers and schools, rather than at the mercy of a mathematical equation. Back in the hands of the people who know the pupils. The people best-placed to assess their abilities. The people who spent weeks meticulously preparing their centre-assessed grades. “It was a kick in the teeth when you see students who have been downgraded that should not have been ,” said St Patricks Principal, Mrs Brenda Mussen, last week. This years students had been been kicked in the teeth and handed the bill for the dental work. With all exam boards across the UK now awarding on the basis of teacher judgement, the bill has been belatedly waived. The pupils of County Derry, and the whole of the country, would have been at a competitive disadvantage through no fault of their own. Reverting to teacher predictions for A-Level results at least creates a more level playing field for this years university intake.The writing has been on the wall since last Thursday. It took until yesterday for the Minister to bother to read it.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Fty-seven cottages were erected on a .-acre patch of land in the Shantallow area, which had been purchased from Sir John McFarland of Aberfoyle on the Strand Road. The land was bought for £,-- - £, in today’s money - and featured a mixture of semi-detached cottages, blocks of four cottages and one detached cottage. A memorial plaque erected by Derry City Council in . Nigel Henderson, a researcher with History Hub Ulster, has been documenting the locations of the , ex-servicemen’s cottages built in Northern Ireland. “The largest colony or collection of cottages in County Londonderry are the ones at Messines Park,” he told the County Derry Post. “I’ve been going through the records trying to get details of the styles of the houses, how many rooms they had, whether they had toilets and bathrooms and things like that. “Once a family was installed in them, they tended to stay there for le, but there were some issues with evictions due to non-payment of rent. “A lot of the guys coming back from the war weren’t able to keep up employment so they may not have been able to pay the rents. “The rents weren’t exorbitant for their time or the standard of the houses, but the ISSLT , were strict at taking people to court for non-payment of rent. “You had guys who were evicted in the early s and then another ex-serviceman might have moved in again. In Belfast, there were guys on the waiting list as far on as the s.” Early plans show the layout of the ex-servicemens three-bedroom cottages at Messines Park. Initial rent for the houses, designed by Roland Ingolby Smith, chief architect for the NI Ministry of Finance from  to , was nine shillings per week, around £ per week today. On the night the Luftwaffe bombed the city, all  fatalities occurred in a row of houses facing onto the Buncrana Road. Nigel Henderson said the attack on Messines Park was unlikely to have been in the Germans’ plan. Instead, it is thought the nearby docks were their intended target. “What I understand is that they were aiming for the docks. During the Second World War in Derry, there was a naval base there,” he said. “It was a base for the Royal Navy going out on patrols in the North Atlantic, but they overshot and Shantallow was not that far from where the docks would have been. Ten members from the Richmond and Murray families died in the attack, along with -year-old James Collins, his -year-old daughter Ellen and William Alexander McFarland. The youngest victim was -month-old Sheila Murray. Their loss was keenly felt within Messines Park, where a strong community spirit had grown since the houses were erected in June .

A colony of ex-servicemen being settled in Derry has the potential to be controversial when looked at through a contemporary eye, but an atmosphere of co-operation prevailed in the aftermath of the First World War. “I don’t think there was any sectarian sentiment against the houses, because for the guys who had moved in, religious affiliation was not a factor,” explained Nigel. “What was taken into account was how big a family they had, whether they had employment, whether they were wounded or gassed in the war, or the standard of housing they had. “Some of those who died were Protestants and some were Roman Catholics and because it was on the edge of the city, they formed almost a small community of their own. “The attitude was that it didn’t matteryou were a Catholic or a Protestant, a unionist or a nationalist, the guys served together. Both communities had been up for participating. “When those guys came home, the religious affiliation of their ex-servicemen neighbours would not have been a major factor or a cause for concern. “They had served together through a nightmare and living close to other ex-servicemen provided an opportunity for them to talk about their shared experiences. “This was something the veterans seldom did inside their homes or with their families.” While not their intended target, the German bombers would no doubt have felt a sense of schadenfreude at how things panned out. Nigel Henderson is struck by the tragic irony of the ex-servicemen’s demise. “It’s the only part of Derry that was hit in the German air raids, but it just happened to be men who had fought in the First World War who were the principal victims,” he said. “That is the irony of it. They survived the Germans in the trenches of the First World War to then die during the Second World War from aerial bombing.” The victims James and Ellen Collins Father and daughter, James and Ellen Collins, lived at  Messines Park.

Lissan conceded their first game to Drumsurn and last week surrendered from a position of strength against Doire Trasna. Shea McKernan had the ball in the net within minutes of the start, getting on the end of a slick passing movement to slot home. Rather than building it, eight first half wides was the story of Kieran OKanes young sides exploits. For all their shortcomings, they were well in contention and led by two points, with eight minutes to go. googletag.cmd.push Disaster struck when Stephen Conway, who made a fine first half save from Ciaran McGowan, shanked a kick-out to Eoghan Quigg who passed for Micheaacutel McNaught to strike a hammer blow to the net they never recovered from. At midfield for Lissan is the towering Conor Loane, an All-Ireland winning goalkeeper with Holy Trinity Cookstown, and MacRory Cup medallist Mattie Loughran, who kicked four points last week. The pair dovetailed well together and in Iarlaith Donaghy, they have one of the most exciting players in the county playing at number six. Defender Oran Donnelly wears , but sits back as a sweeper, with the nimble Joey Quinn playing up front with Tiarnach Donaghy. googletag.cmd.push Coming Lissans way this weekend is a Faughanvale side who have posted two wins from as many games and had a tough battle to overcome a Drumsurn side who arguably deserved a draw. Manager Joe Gray has had to come to terms with long-term injuries to Oisin Quinn and Jordan Curran. Michael McLaughlin spent last summer in America, but he is back and forms an inside forward duo with Kevin Martin. Paddy OKane is one of their key players and Lissan may face a kick-back after his quiet outing in the last round. He played off the front two, but their running game almost bypassed their middle sector. Gordon Fahey and Michael Sweeney are a formidable defensive spine, with skipper Conor McGuinness nestled between them as a sweeper - a formation that will mirror the Lissan setup,both managers adopt the same approach this time around. The Vale will also have questions to answer. When Drumsurn went down to  men, Grays side couldnt get their hands on the ball and had to rely on a strong finish. On the flip side, apart from the one they scored, the Vale carved out the best two goal chances over the course of the game. A tough ask for Lissan who cant finish above the bottom. Kieran OKane will have his side well-prepared, but Faughanvale will be fancied to come through. VERDICT: Faughanvale RELATEDJoe Grays reaction to the Vales win over Drumsurn.

The plans see new guidance released for parents and carers setting out what steps will be taken to safeguard young people when they travel, alongside simple advice on the safety actions they can also take to protect themselves and others, so everyone travels safely together. “Safety is always our top priority, saidDavid Cowan, Translink Director of Commercial Operations.  In line with the Department for Education guidelines, we have worked with EA colleagues and local schools to introduce appropriate school transport fromstSeptemberthat aims to maximise services in order to help manage the number of pupils travelling at peak times. googletag.cmd.push This will include operating extra school services ​and more ‘school only’ services, to provide increased capacity as required. “We know this will be an unsettling time for parents and for many young people it will be their first time back on public transport. Many things will look dferent with a range of safety measures now on board and in stations for everyone’s protection. “We expect that both scheduled timetabled services and dedicated ‘school only’ services will be busy at peak times andwhere possible, we encourage pupils to consider walking or cycling to and from school. “We continue to enhance our safety standards withregular deep cleaning of our vehicles and facilities using long lasting anti-viral disinfectant and our mobile cleaning teams are sanitising common touch areas. googletag.cmd.push We have protective screens in stations and on bus drivers cabs and have provided hand sanitiser in all main bus and train stations. “It is now compulsory for all pupils aged  or over to wear a face covering on public transport anditis strongly recommended that all pupils regardless of age should wear a face covering on any form of home to school transportwhere it is appropriate for them to do so.

The plans see new guidance released for parents and carers setting out what steps will be taken to safeguard young people when they travel, alongside simple advice on the safety actions they can also take to protect themselves and others, so everyone travels safely together. “Safety is always our top priority, saidDavid Cowan, Translink Director of Commercial Operations.  In line with the Department for Education guidelines, we have worked with EA colleagues and local schools to introduce appropriate school transport fromstSeptemberthat aims to maximise services in order to help manage the number of pupils travelling at peak times. googletag.cmd.push This will include operating extra school services ​and more ‘school only’ services, to provide increased capacity as required. “We know this will be an unsettling time for parents and for many young people it will be their first time back on public transport. Many things will look dferent with a range of safety measures now on board and in stations for everyone’s protection. “We expect that both scheduled timetabled services and dedicated ‘school only’ services will be busy at peak times andwhere possible, we encourage pupils to consider walking or cycling to and from school. “We continue to enhance our safety standards withregular deep cleaning of our vehicles and facilities using long lasting anti-viral disinfectant and our mobile cleaning teams are sanitising common touch areas. googletag.cmd.push We have protective screens in stations and on bus drivers cabs and have provided hand sanitiser in all main bus and train stations. “It is now compulsory for all pupils aged  or over to wear a face covering on public transport anditis strongly recommended that all pupils regardless of age should wear a face covering on any form of home to school transportwhere it is appropriate for them to do so.

In family, business and community. Devastation and disbelief reached into every corner of County Derry last Friday afternoon, as the news of his sudden death filtered through. Everyone I spoke with over the weekend was just in shock. My thoughts are with his we Anne and the entire family, as they unite in grief. Rarely would you see Hugh without Anne. They went everywhere together. His family were never far behind. My sympathy also goes out to his daughter Maureen, son Carlus, son-in-law Benny, daughter-in-law Maria, his grandchildren Ollie, Leo, Fiadh and Lily Anna. Its not often you go to Owenbeg that you dont see them all there to take in a game, no matter who is playing. googletag.cmd.push Hugh Peter was well-known far from his own townland of Cloane. He was Managing Director of HA Mechanical Services, a company he started in  with his we Anne. Together, they grew the firm from six employees to over . When you think of a local community, the provision of local jobs is unquantiable. The parish of Ballinascreen and the surrounding areas have benefited greatly. In terms of an amateur sport, like GAA, one of the factors rarely mentioned is the importance of clubs not losing players forced to emigrate in search of work. This cant be done without stable employers, without people like Hugh McWilliams. googletag.cmd.push Then there is the sponsorship element. Hugh and Anne have been the Derry GAAs main sponsor since taking over at the end of the  season. They also sponsor the camogie and ladies football teams, while also backing the senior football and hurling leagues. Derrys statement last week was very apt, labelling Hugh as a giant of generosity and all at a time when the HA logo wasnt splashed across the national media like the big hitters of Dublin, Kerry and Kilkenny. Closer to home, HA are also in their fth year as Ballinascreens main sponsor, also across all four codes. Other examples of Hughs generosity went unnoticed, away from having a company brand associated with it. All the local schools benefited from his support, local mental health charity STEPS and St Vincent de Paul. The list could go on. Two years ago, to celebrate  years of HA, he held a family fun day at the local An Raacuteth Dubh Community Centre. From the moment you walked through the gate, everything was on Hughs tab...from the bouncy castles to the refreshments. They also organised a charity golf day and coffee morning, with all three events raising pound,. He bumped the total up himself, so both charities – Cancer Fund for Children and South Derry Downs Syndrome - were presented with cheques for poundk. For such a successful business man, he never forgot where he came from. He wasnt shy about putting something back. And all with modesty, far from any fanfare. One of the most enjoyable years of my le was the summer of , training the Derry minor team. A swing of Damien Reddingtons left boot may have snatched the All-Ireland minor title from our grasp, but I feel much richer for being involved with that group. We had some craic along the way - sailing up and down the M in the big yellow bus, with the tunes belting and the summer opening up in front of us. There was also a special bond with the supporters and parents. It was the first time I met Hugh Peter. He left Carlus to the bus one Saturday morning when we were Ballyshannon bound to play Roscommon in a challenge game. The Rossies had won the All-Ireland the previous year and Hugh was asking how long I thought the Derry minors summer would last. We hadnt a clue. It was one eventful step at a time. Fast forward to September and as I got off the bus and trudged through the lobby of Dublins Crown Plaza after the All-Ireland final heartbreak, Hugh came forward to shake my hand. Defeat was gurgling in the pit of both our stomachs. I cant remember exactly what he said, but, he was thanking us, while relaying how much his son had enjoyed the journey. Years later when John Francis Bradley, who also played on the same minor team, was seriously injured in a car crash and fighting for his le. Ballinascreen club, with Hugh McWilliams at the forefront, arranged a Night for JF. Screen club was packed. You couldnt have turned a sweet in your mouth. In hospital that night, John Francis spoke for the first time since his accident. The next morning Hugh delivered the many items from the auction to the Bradley family and gave him a pathway back into work. The club later handed over the money donated on the night. Another example of giving. You could write a book. A few months after that All-Ireland minor final, Hugh arranged for a gathering of the squad at the Hogan Stand Bar in Moneyneena. There was music, a buffet, craic and Hugh was in his element. It was like closure on the season. I always enjoy calling into the Hogan Stand and the owner, Tempo man Charlie McNally, claims his porter is the best around. If Hugh was there, he would always send a pint down my direction, like he did for many others. He would never accept one back, but would merely invite you into a football debate with him and Pele, his close friend John Scullion. Hugh would love it. The topic was usually - Screen, Slaughtneil, the Derry championship, the county scene and back to Screen again. Often there would be agreement, sometimes there wasnt and the slagging would begin before theydto chatting with their wives Anne and Mary G. The four of them were so close. Tuesday was no doubt tough day for everyone in the McWilliams family circle, in Ballinascreen and beyond as they said their final goodbye. Hugh often coined the phrase its not about being here for a long time, its about being here for a good time. He always had time for a smile, time for a chat and enjoyed le to the full. He will be sadly missed by his family and friends. I count myself lucky to have known him.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

My sympathy also goes out to his daughter Maureen, son Carlus, son-in-law Benny, daughter-in-law Maria, his grandchildren Ollie, Leo, Fiadh and Lily Anna. Its not often you go to Owenbeg that you dont see them all there to take in a game, no matter who is playing. googletag.cmd.push Hugh Peter was well-known far from his own townland of Cloane. He was Managing Director of HA Mechanical Services, a company he started in  with his we Anne. Together, they grew the firm from six employees to over . When you think of a local community, the provision of local jobs is unquantiable. The parish of Ballinascreen and the surrounding areas have benefited greatly. In terms of an amateur sport, like GAA, one of the factors rarely mentioned is the importance of clubs not losing players forced to emigrate in search of work. This cant be done without stable employers, without people like Hugh McWilliams. googletag.cmd.push Then there is the sponsorship element. Hugh and Anne have been the Derry GAAs main sponsor since taking over at the end of the  season. They also sponsor the camogie and ladies football teams, while also backing the senior football and hurling leagues. Derrys statement last week was very apt, labelling Hugh as a giant of generosity and all at a time when the HA logo wasnt splashed across the national media like the big hitters of Dublin, Kerry and Kilkenny. Closer to home, HA are also in their fth year as Ballinascreens main sponsor, also across all four codes. Other examples of Hughs generosity went unnoticed, away from having a company brand associated with it. All the local schools benefited from his support, local mental health charity STEPS and St Vincent de Paul. The list could go on. Two years ago, to celebrate  years of HA, he held a family fun day at the local An Raacuteth Dubh Community Centre. From the moment you walked through the gate, everything was on Hughs tab...from the bouncy castles to the refreshments. They also organised a charity golf day and coffee morning, with all three events raising pound,. He bumped the total up himself, so both charities – Cancer Fund for Children and South Derry Downs Syndrome - were presented with cheques for poundk. For such a successful business man, he never forgot where he came from. He wasnt shy about putting something back. And all with modesty, far from any fanfare. One of the most enjoyable years of my le was the summer of , training the Derry minor team. A swing of Damien Reddingtons left boot may have snatched the All-Ireland minor title from our grasp, but I feel much richer for being involved with that group. We had some craic along the way - sailing up and down the M in the big yellow bus, with the tunes belting and the summer opening up in front of us. There was also a special bond with the supporters and parents. It was the first time I met Hugh Peter. He left Carlus to the bus one Saturday morning when we were Ballyshannon bound to play Roscommon in a challenge game. The Rossies had won the All-Ireland the previous year and Hugh was asking how long I thought the Derry minors summer would last. We hadnt a clue. It was one eventful step at a time. Fast forward to September and as I got off the bus and trudged through the lobby of Dublins Crown Plaza after the All-Ireland final heartbreak, Hugh came forward to shake my hand. Defeat was gurgling in the pit of both our stomachs. I cant remember exactly what he said, but, he was thanking us, while relaying how much his son had enjoyed the journey. Years later when John Francis Bradley, who also played on the same minor team, was seriously injured in a car crash and fighting for his le. Ballinascreen club, with Hugh McWilliams at the forefront, arranged a Night for JF. Screen club was packed. You couldnt have turned a sweet in your mouth. In hospital that night, John Francis spoke for the first time since his accident. The next morning Hugh delivered the many items from the auction to the Bradley family and gave him a pathway back into work. The club later handed over the money donated on the night. Another example of giving. You could write a book. A few months after that All-Ireland minor final, Hugh arranged for a gathering of the squad at the Hogan Stand Bar in Moneyneena. There was music, a buffet, craic and Hugh was in his element. It was like closure on the season. I always enjoy calling into the Hogan Stand and the owner, Tempo man Charlie McNally, claims his porter is the best around. If Hugh was there, he would always send a pint down my direction, like he did for many others. He would never accept one back, but would merely invite you into a football debate with him and Pele, his close friend John Scullion. Hugh would love it. The topic was usually - Screen, Slaughtneil, the Derry championship, the county scene and back to Screen again. Often there would be agreement, sometimes there wasnt and the slagging would begin before theydto chatting with their wives Anne and Mary G. The four of them were so close. Tuesday was no doubt tough day for everyone in the McWilliams family circle, in Ballinascreen and beyond as they said their final goodbye. Hugh often coined the phrase its not about being here for a long time, its about being here for a good time. He always had time for a smile, time for a chat and enjoyed le to the full. He will be sadly missed by his family and friends. I count myself lucky to have known him.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Trailing to Joseph Olowu’s early goal, the Candystripes were in trouble again, but hit back strongly in the second half with goals from Walter Figueira and Adam Hamill before James Akintunde sealed the win late on. The game started disastrously for Derry who conceded with the first attack on their goal just three minutes in, Kevin O’Connor’s high ball into a packed penalty area spilled by Peter Cherrie, allowing Joseph Olowu to capitalise, volleying the ball into the empty net to make it - to the visitors. googletag.cmd.push City were straight onto the offensive at the start of the second half two goals in three minutes turned the game on its head.

Mark McNulty was unable to hold onto a high cross from Ciaran Coll and Jack Malone did superbly to keep the opportunity alive, pulling it back for Walter Figueira to fire home, much to the relief and delight of the home side. That relief turned to joy within two minutes as City turned the game on its head with a second goal. Again Meite was heavily involved, showing great strength and skill to hold off two Cork defenders on his way to goal. Meite seemed certain to score, but his effort was brilliantly parried by McNulty, only for the ball to roll across goal where Hammill was on hand to roll in his first goal for the club. googletag.cmd.push It took an extraordinary save from Cherrie to keep his team ahead in the last five minutes as the City goalkeeper somehow got his hand to Connor Simpson’s cross, clawing it off the goal line to save his team. The win was sealed with the very last kick of the game as James Akintunde collected the ball off Stephen Mallon and hooked the ball into the bottom corner to give the Candystripes a very valuable win.

I am very proud that our incoming head boy, Cormac Savage, was at the forefront of this campaign and believe his contribution was pivotal in ensuring that the sense of injustice and unfairness felt by his peers was articulated in a forceful and timely manner.Mr McCann also welcomed confirmation that GCSE grades will be awarded as calculated by schools.ldquoTeachers were asked to exercise professional judgment and engaged in a robust process to ensure that pupil effort and attainment in the period from September  to the unexpected and unprecedented closing of schools in March was rewarded, he said. ldquoA great deal of time and energy was devoted to this task by the staff of St. Patrickrsquos Grammar to ensure that grades were awarded fairly and consistently.Down High principal Maud Perry, said after the initial publication of results last Thursday the school was celebrating its best ever A-Level achievements.ldquoThis was unsurprising, as this particular year group achieved the schoolrsquos best ever AS results last year, she said.ldquoThis was a very dferent year in so many ways, but Down High pupils continue to be among the best qualied of their generation and, beyond the curriculum, our pupils are enriched, socially confident and ready to take their place as leaders of the future in whatever fields they choose. Congratulations to all of the pupils on these fully deserved grades.Shimna Integrated College principal Kevin Lambe congratulated the schoolrsquos ldquowonderful A level students who weathered the storm of this unprecedented year.He said he was delighted that the vast majority of students had already been placed at their first choice of university before the restoration of the teacher assessed grades on Monday afternoon.Mr Lambe said that while there had been considerable controversy about the process of awarding grades this year, he paid tribute to the excellent guidance document CCEA provided and to the commitment and energy his staff brought to the grading process.ldquoI am quite sure that the moderation process was undertaken in good faith, but it caused dreadful damage and heartache across the country, he said. ldquoThe CCEA guidance was sound, the work of teachers was thoroughgoing, the teacher awarded grades were the right ones and I am absolutely delighted that they have been restored.Ballynahinchrsquos Assumption Grammar School said it was delighted with the government U-turn in awarding grades as the original process ldquocaused signicant emotional upheaval which affected students, parents and our staff.ldquoWe are fortunate in that over % of our A students had already accessed their chosen university or workplace and hope that now almost every girl has achieved their true potential and will be able to access a iety of career pathways. Assumption Girls set the highest of standards year on year and we are proud of our Year  Girls who excelled in every subject at every level, said a school statement.ldquoOur AS students now have a solid foundation of grades which will give them the confidence to believe in their own potential to achieve at the highest of levels as they enter A level. We wish our GCSE girls the best of luck for tomorrowrsquos results.Castlewellanrsquos St Malachyrsquos High School said it was pleased with Education Minister Peter Weirrsquos announcement that AS and A level students will receive their centre assessment grades or the grade awarded by the examining body, whichever is higher.ldquoWe continue to work hard in St Malachyrsquos in the best interests of all our young people, said a statement issued on Monday evening. We are all here in St Malachyrsquos to help and support our students in the best way we can. Congratulations on their wonderful achievements we wish them all the very best in the future.De La Salle High School principal Ciaran Maguire described the past academic year for students as ldquochallenging.He said students adhered to social distancing guidelines collecting their results last Thursday, with the school delighted with their overall grades.ldquoA-Level results across the province has been one of confusion and uncertainty, said Mr Maguire.ldquoWe as a school were relieved that the majority of the teacher assessment grades were secured for our pupils and will continue to appeal and challenge those that need to be addressed to ensure that all pupils get the right outcome, allowing them to progress in an ever changing world.Before Mondayrsquos announcement, Mr Mark Morgan, principal at St Colmanrsquos High and Sixth Form College in Ballynahinch, said the continued year on year improvement in grades from the students appeared to have been curtailed by the examination bodies.He said teacher predicted grades, which were in line with all the tracking data, appeared to have been totally ignored and grades were given that bore no reflection to the historic and contemporaneous standard attained by students at the school.St Maryrsquos High School in Downpatrick congratulated its A-Level and AS-Level students who received their results.The school said the studentsrsquo success was a ldquoreflection of their hard work, determination to succeed and dedicated teaching staff who always go the extra mile.ldquoOur steady, upward trend in examination results has continued this year and we wish our students all the very best as they begin their studies at university, the statement added..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/19th August 2020 53.jpg","title":"53 dogs put down in past year – one third of all in NI  ","story":"A LOCAL politician says she is ldquoheartbroken that more dogs being put to sleep in Newry, Mourne and Down than any other council area in Northern Ireland.Fty-three dogs were destroyed in Newry, Mourne and Down in - out of a total of  for the whole province.Thatrsquos almost twice as many as the next highest area, which is Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon with .By contrast six councils reported single figure death rates, while not a single dog was put to sleep in Ards and North Down.Rowallane area councillor Kathryn Owen says the figure for Newry, Mourne and Down makes for ldquogrim reading.Cllr Owen, who has four dogs, says the council should look to the successful measures being implemented in other council areas.ldquoTo say Irsquom heartbroken about the immense number of dogs destroyed in Newry, Mourne and Down District would be an understatement, she said.ldquoThis is not a statistic that we should be proud of.

The Minister cannot allow all this to simply be thrown away.Ms Armstrong said the local community previously stood together to save Exploris and would do so again.She added: ldquoI would urge anyone with concerns to make their voice heard and lodge their concerns and together we can save our local economy.It is believed that the poundm aquarium proposal for Belfast could create more than  full-time jobs and would be the biggest attraction of its kind on the island of Ireland, with city planners recommending that the new development should be given the green light.The firm behind it, reefLIVE, says around  to  jobs could be created during its construction, with  full-time posts created when it opens its doors, subject to securing planning approval.The aquarium would be a two-storey building, based across more than , sq ft and include a cafe, coral reef ocean tank, with the main exhibition space across five zones on the first floor ndash themed as Ireland, Deep Ocean, Azores, Pacic and Arctic.Around  representations were received in relation to the planning application, including  letters of objection.Concerns included the impact to traffic and travel, the impact on heritage for both listed buildings and monuments, flooding and the potential negative impact on the Exploris aquarium in Portaferry.Those behind the planned tourist attraction say it is anticipated the reefLIVE Aquarium will be the largest marine-le visitor attraction on the island of Ireland and in bringing another international-standard attraction to the Titanic Quarter, would help to boost theof tourist visits to the city.In recommending the scheme for approval, Belfast City Council planners said that ldquohaving regard to the development plan and other material considerations, including the issues raised by the representation, the proposal is considered and approval of planning permission is recommended with delegated authority given to the director of planning and building control to finalise the wording of conditions subject to no new substantive planning issues being raised by third parties..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/19th August 2020 Celebrations.jpg","title":"Celebrations to mark the end of WW2  ","story":"CHURCH bells rang out across Killyleagh on Saturday morning to mark the th anniversary of VJ Day.The bells of St Johnrsquos Church of Ireland were tolled as part of the UK-wide commemorations of the anniversary.The day when the Second World War finally ended was celebrated with a short interdenominational act of remembrance at the War Memorial.At am former Army chaplain Hector Wanliss gave a ure reading and led prayers of thanksgiving for the men of Killyleagh, Shrigley and district who went to war, and for peace.Then Last Post and Reveille were sounded by Ronnie Cromie and Wilmer Cromie before two minutesrsquo silence was observed and Binyonrsquos Lines were recited by Billy Croskery, the chairman of Killyleagh and Killinchy Royal British Legion.A wreath was then laid by Mr Croskery, who was escorted by Kevin Kelly.Sadly Killyleaghrsquos last remaining Second World War veteran, Martin `Tinarsquo Charters, who is aged , was not able to take part on this occasion.Social distancing measures were in place and the organisers are grateful for those who attended adhering to these.It was a timely reminder that the main highlight of the year, the Killyleagh VE  celebrations, had to be cancelled in May by the Killyleagh Remembers the War group in the wake of the Coronavirus alert and the danger of public gatherings.The Killyleagh group has now cancelled its next proposed event, a lecture on the Second World War in the library due to be given by author George Busby on September .ldquoWe will be keeping under review the remaining schedule of the programme, in conjunction with the Heritage Lottery Fund.

dficulties getting rid of waste water and it is believed the problem is because their homes are below the level of the sewage treatment plant in Spa.Mr Bicker said Water Service officials are addressing the problem in a bid to come up with a solution and says that until they have completed their work, no new homes should be constructed in the Spa area.He revealed that  new homes are already in the pipeline and fears once they have been constructed, they will exacerbate the sewage problem.Mr Bicker said he has every sympathy for the Water Services engineers currently working to

Itrsquos never too early to encourage a love of physical activity in children.Briacuted is passionate about the benefits of dance for young children. ldquoDance is wonderful for coordination. It develops strength and endurance. Through dancing, a toddler will learn from the early age about what their bodies are capable of, she says.ldquo At the same time, it will build their curiosity as naturally they will experiment with certain movements. If toddlers have been introduced to dancing since early age, the chance of them developing good kinesthetic memory is increased.ldquoDuring class we work on key skills such as counting and sequencing thus subtlety engaging with numeracy and literacy. We incorporate sensory props such as ribbons, scarfs, feathers, bubbles and each dancer brings their own favourite toy to dance with. We introduce the foundations of Irish dance and enjoy watching a potential le long journey of dance begin.Following the Tapping Tots class, some  dancers attended the studio for an Irish dance camp with a dference.

This time Ardal McMahon provided the finish as they reached the water break.The RGU management team were left with plenty to ponder. Downpatrick continued to battle after the resumption, determined not to be hit by the threat of an avalanche of Rostrevor scores.At this stage there looked to be a real danger that Rostrevor would cut loose. To their credit, Downpatrick did not throw in the towel.Caolan Mooney burst through on the Downpatrick goal not long before half-time and a penalty was awardedwhen he was up-ended by goalkeeper Deeny. Shaun Parr stepped up and netted Rostrevorrsquos third goal.Downpatrick were given a glimmer of hope just before the interval when Parr and then Sean Cooper were black-carded.However at half-time, and the score at - to -, Downpatrickrsquos task looked onerous.The RGU came out with the right attitude to mount a revival in the second half and Doylersquos early minor reduced the gap.Chris Magee helped lead the Downpatrick forward linersquos continuing assaults on the Rostrevor goal with a couple of scores. And there emerged a real feeling of optimism amongst the massed Downpatrick ranks when Conor McGradyrsquos point left just two in it.However Rostrevor refused to hit the panic button. Guided by the experience of Mooney, they stretched their lead before the next water break.Downpatrick were awarded a penalty with the scoreboard reading - to -. However when Rostrevor needed a big moment at just the right time, goalkeeper Gareth Clarke provided it, plunging to push Tim Prenterrsquos effort to safety.That was the moment which really deflated Downpatrickrsquos resolve. You sensed that Rostrevor knew they had weathered the best that Downpatrick could summon in response to their deficit.Jordan Fegan then broke away in the closing minutes, before splitting the posts and taking Rostrevorrsquos score to -.Kane applied a classy coup de grace with the final score of the evening for the victors when he spun the Downpatrick defence and, bearing down on goal, took the safe option of landing the point.In the end it looked plain sailing on paper for Rostrevor. Certainly in terms of the opening they made to the match, catching the RGU cold, they laid the foundations early that kept many of the worries away that Downpatrick could spring a result on them.To Downpatrickrsquos credit, after that disappointing early start, there were more than enough signs there that the spirit within the camp to dig in and get themselves out of trouble in games is there.Downpatrick: James Deeny, Paddy Smith, Ronan Murphy, Eoin Rooney, Nathan McShane, Gerdie Collins, Conor Doherty, Damian Turley, Jonny Bell, Tim Prenter , Conor McGrady , Conor McCarron , Ruairi Quinn , Peter Turley , Chris Magee .Subs: Jarlath Brannigan , Morgan Fitzpatrick, Caolan Boyd, Damian Branf, Daniel McCarron, Garrett Trainor, Ruairi Og Quinn, Frank Starkey, Tom Savage, Tim Collins, Aidan McNeill, Con Farrell, Aidan Og Robinson.Rostrevor: Gareth Clarke, Jarlath Farrell, Tomas Gordon, Eoin Murdock, Nicky Murray, Colm Murney, James Donaghy, Sean Cooper, Caolan Mooney , Ardghal McMahon , Jordan Fegan , Patrick Magee, Conor Doyle , Shaun Parr, Piaras Kane .Subs: Paul McGrath, Richie Reynolds, Darren McElhinney, Conall Gordon, Eamon McConville.

But in Northern Ireland wet and grey conditions were not that unusual because autumnal weather typically begins in late AugustThe exceptional spring weather helped many people to survive psychologically being trapped at home .I knew we would pay for such a fine April and May. It was a near mathematical certainty that we would get bad summer weather.Average hours of annual sunshine in Northern Ireland are roughly the same from year to year . That means thatthere is a prolonged sunny spell, then – almost necessarily – there will be many dull days, to bring the annual total back towards the statistical norm. \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

The weather in Northern Ireland was oustanding in April and May, which meant some form of payback was due in terms of lots of dull summer days, writes Ben Lowry. Picture: Michael CooperAnd sure enough we suffered payback. July was the dullest in NI in more than  years, according to Armagh Observatory. It was also wetter and cooler than average.August has been poor, particularly the last week. I associate late August with the onset of autumn.While the Mediterranean gets hot weather into October and southern England is warm until late September, Northern Ireland summers end early.My late uncle rented a house on the north coast in the last week of each August. I have happy memories of those trips but not of the weather. It has been wet across Britain and Ireland over the last week, such as at the Front Strand in Youghal, Co. Cork above on Wednesday. But in Northern Ireland it was not that unusual because autumnal weather typically begins in late August.

There were growing reports of teenage parties after this time, because there is only so long that people will accept massive restrictionsThe chief medical officer for Northern Ireland, Dr Michael Maguire, said he would recommend such sweeping restrictionsCovid- infections hit  people per , .Robin Swann, the health minister, also gave warning that ato lockdown could not be ruled out,cases keep rising.Dr McBride, as a health official who lacks an elected mandate, was careful to say that it was not ultimately his call. He said that any recommendations would “need to go to the executive at the appropriate time for them to make a decision”. \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...That is the traditional protocol. Now, however, western world politicians often defer big decisions to committees or experts, rather than make hard choices themselves.Even the supposedly radical Tory government in London, whichwants to shake up how the UK is governed, has hidden its pandemic decision making behind scientists.The A Level-GCSE fiasco is rooted in the cowardice that led to UK schools being shut earlier than the government wanted, and staying closed for longer.Even now teaching unions and other voices are trying to stop a fullto school next month, when in fact there should have been a push to get pupils back in the weeks after Easter– or at least exam years.There are four broad reasons why ato anything like the general lockdown we experienced after March  is not plausible.• The first is that the nation can’t afford to sustain the furlough schemeIt has already pushed debt to perilous levels. If furlough was extended into next year, there would need to be massive tax increases and spending cuts, including public sector pay cuts .NI politicians have no stomach for such toughness. Even in a financial crisis, Stormont seems only ever inclined to grant pay rises, including a huge recent teacher rise. Councils abused furlough by topping up Treasury funding of % of salaries with ratepayer cash to ensure no staff had any pay reduction.• The second reason lockdown is not feasible is the public mood. The UK government has been fairly criticised for the many things it did wrong over Covid, but few people cite thingsit got right. Its behavioural experts saidlockdown came in too early people would get fed up after a while, and begin to break it. That began to happen after two months. In June there were growing reports of young people socialising in groups .As well as fatigue with restrictions, people began to develop an instinctive sense of the risk of Covid, similar to how we assess car travel .• The third reason lockdown is not feasible is that infection levels do not justy such a massive response.Even the level cited by Dr McBride –  per , cases – is low according to some experts. Prof Carl Heneghan of Oxford’s Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine said epidemic level is five times higher .He said people were failing to understand, and balance, risks.Mr Swann and Dr McBride have accepted such balance over schooling .But such balancing equations should be applied more widely .Few politicians are candid that the Covid risk cannot be cut to zero.Sweden’s former state epidemiologist Prof Johan Giesecke said from the outset that it was not possible to halt Covid’s spread. Recent upsurges in case even in nations that were seen as models of control, such as Germany and South Korea, have vindicated that prediction. • The fourth reason another lockdown is not feasible is specic to NI: Bobby Storey’s funeral shattered Stormont’s authority. There was a cross-party determination to protect Sinn Fein . This meant the first and deputy first ministers cannot preside over press briefings that might reveal suspension of liberty.Instead, the political parties erted attention from the calculating nature of SF leaders’ social distancing breach on June  in westBelfast by backing probes into important but secondary matters such as PSNI and Belfast council handling of the funeral. But in the absence of sanction against hypocritical leaders who set the rules, the damage is irreparable. A population that for months largely obeyed lockdown, including missing funerals of loved ones, watched as republicans were allowed to do as they pleased.• Ben Lowryis News Letter deputy editor• Ben Lowry: Autumn in Northern Ireland always seems to arrive in late August——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

I was a mere child then and childhood dreams develop realism as time moves on.The family home eventually became too small for us and we moved on, but not far away. My mother pined to get back to the area which she eventually did by which time I had left school, had started working and soon that meant living away from home except for the Christmas holidays. That was the one time of the year you could be guaranteed to escape what we called the midges or mayflies, to give them their proper title, harmless little blighters but a great nuisance. And this year, particularly this month, it seems, those mayflies are ‘torturing‘ the locals because August is the month of the mayfly andit’s a good, warm month they breed in their zillions.I remember having to close up bedroom windows at night andI went to visit my elderly Aunt Lizzie, who lived right on the shore at Ballyronan, she kept a permanently rolled up newspaper which she took everywhere with her.  \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...Her laneway was fairly long and when I visited I always dreaded having to cycle though this buzzing throng with mouth closed and breath held until I could reach her front door.The mayflies first arrive in May but this balmy warm August, has been particularly perfect weather for the second generation of little blighters on all shores of the lough. Barbeques  Out of the question. Strolling around the shore on a calm evening  Forget it. The mayflies cover the walls of houses and the windows, for all the world resembling a black plague. My mother would spend her mornings shovelling them away from the doors and windows yes, even those that got inside. When the well-known McGarry Brothers were building boats on the shore not far from BallyronanI recall seeing the dead flies stacked high in their boatyard, the perfect dung heap for locals keen for valuable free compost for their gardens.Tennis, GAA matches, even paddling on the shore was out of the question when the flies took over.The sadness of it all is that most parts of the shores of Lough Neagh are scenically beautul and understandably people want to build homes there. Those who haven’t done their homework and have built a home overlooking the water will get a shock when the first tranche of mayflies arrive.These creatures spread themselves over everything including the highest trees. Fly killing sprays are useless. They come, set up home and don’t die off or go away until it suits them. And, it was that that persuaded me that no matter how much I loved the place I could never live there. I wasn’t even keen to visit the family home until the flies had gone.I try to avoid driving in the area when the mayflies are active as they splatter the windscreen ruining your vision and needing to be scraped off because they harden like glue. Step ouside the car and you’re covered in them.In sense they are not unlike the coronavirus – a first tranche arrives taking lives and scaring us witless. We try to get it under control only for a second lot to move in or at least we have been told to expect one. Even our scientists are fairly certain the virus willwith the cold weather. Our Health Minister Robin Swann has us well warned. So the police needed go looking for beach parties or illegal raves around the shores of Lough Neagh. The mayfly, though harmless, is a thorough pest which comes and goes as it pleases.\"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-drMfKT fpqScQ\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg eOOfIS\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-drMfKT fpqScQ\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg eOOfIS\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-gxMtzJ sc-dfVpRl dLpuYr\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy News you can trust since Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusGetting outFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

For those who believe they are immune they need to know better. This virus can and has taken lives”Minister Swann said recently his department recently has been dealing “with a signicant outbreak in a meat processing plant”.He said  cases were detected in staff and further cases of contact. He said all staff were being tested and many were self-isolating.Dr McBride added that “theof schools could see pressure on the R number”.“If your child has symptoms then keep them at home,” he added. “Get them tested.

The Resort’s senior team remains in regular communication with those impacted to provide support and a further test will be carried out with both team members prior to ato work.Galgorm Collection Managing Director, Colin Johnston, said:“We share the concerns around the recent increase in the number of Covid- cases and, like many employers in the area, we have been monitoring this extremely closely. In response, we have already put additional measures in place.Last week, we moved to the next phase of our agreed, comprehensive Hygiene Commitment plan which includes increased random testing of team members, who continue to operate within team bubbles.In addition, we are also the first company in Northern Ireland to introduce a Mistpal Cleansing Tunnel for team members and guests entering the Resort for further safety reassurance. This is in addition to already established measures including a nightly, full deep-clean of all areas with hospital-grade sanitiser protectant and decontamination equipment, thermal temperature monitoring, provision of hand sanitisers in all areas and adherence to recommended social distancing guidelines.The health and safety of our team and guests remains paramount and we are grateful for their continued support and also to those guests who have rescheduled their stay as a result of the robust pre-entry testing measures we have in place.”Galgorm Spa  Golf Resort has already carried out tests with almost  team members and will continue to conduct random testing and adopt the same stringent protocols already in place in the event that any further positive cases are identied.Since reopening Galgorm Spa  Golf Resort has been focused on safety as a priority and was among the first hotels in the UK to receive the AA COVID Confident Mark for its industry leading health and safety standards.

All children in Wales have had the opportunity to lsquocheck in, catch up and preparersquo before the summer holidays, and we hope this will stand them in good stead for the changes they are due to encounter in the upcoming months. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.
