The brain registers the majority of information about flavour via millions of olfactory (smell) cells, so that is why the cider must be swirled in the glass to release aromas. A wine glass is best for doing this, but don’t fill it to the brim as the cider needs space to breathe so the aromas develop. Gently swirl the cider a couple of times and sniff it. Then take a sip and let the cider cover the tongue. More aromas will be released and travel to the nasal cavity through the back of the throat. Think about what you smell and taste, the cider’s body, the texture, the overall drinking experience. Then repeat. That’s how to taste cider! All-occasion quaffing: Thatchers Gold Thatchers’ flagship cider, Gold, is a blend of several apple varieties. Eating apples bestow Thatchers Gold fruitiness and a satisfying “bite”, while cider apples including two of the undisputed superstars – dabinett and Harry Masters Jersey – give body and depth to the flavour. Thatchers Gold is an eminently quaffable cider for all occasions with ripe and juicy green apple aromas and flavours bursting from the glass, a sherbet-like mouthfeel with gentle carbonation, and a refreshing tang. If you are a wine drinker looking for a cider to suit your palate then Thatchers Gold will appeal to fans of viognier. Pair with grilled sea bass, or satay vegetables if you’re veggie. Cheshire cheese is a great match too its slight saltiness will contract the cider’s underlying sweetness. Crisp and cloudy: Thatchers HazeThatchers Haze brims with fruitiness from a blend of fruit bowl favourites: discovery, falstaff, gala and jonagold. Cider made from eating apples tends to be light-bodied and crisp, and Thatchers Haze is no exception. A solid entry-level blend for those wishing to explore cider more deeply on the nose and palate it has green apples, pears, banana, a hint of lemon, an effervescent mouthfeel, and a sweet tangy finish. The cider’s distinct natural cloudiness is thanks to jonagold apple juice adding a sweetness that makes Thatchers Haze match especially well with spicy foods, such as falafel burgers, or spicy pork stir-fry. For wine drinkers, if you imagine riesling with that easy-drinking fruitiness and refreshing acidity, then Thatchers Haze will appeal to the same palate. The solo star: Thatchers KatyWhile most ciders are made from blending different apple varieties, Thatchers Katy is a single-variety cider. Made from the popular eating apple of the same name, it is fresh and fruity with a subtle sweetness, a refreshing acidity, tingling carbonation and crisp, tangy finish. Thatchers ferments Katy apples with a type of yeast that sparkling wine producers use, enhancing the flavour. However, there’s evidence to suggest it was 17th-century West Country cider makers who first experimented with secondary fermentation to add a natural sparkle to the drink, some time before champagne was invented – so you could say that cider was the original sparkling tipple. Take the flute challenge – pour a glass of Thatchers Katy and a glass of prosecco and blind taste them – which is the wine and which is the premium cider? Thatchers Katy is perfect as an aperitif and for dining. Food-wise, go for lighter textured food with delicate flavours, such as grilled cod and asparagus risotto. For a cheese match, the savoury salty flavours of parmesan are a contrast to the fruity sweetness of Thatchers Katy. Sweet explosion: Thatchers RoséWaves of strawberry, raspberry and cherry flavours refresh the mouth. Thatchers Rosé cider is made exclusively from those dessert apple favourites cripps pink, gala and fuji. Sweet fruitiness pops and fizzes across your tongue, before the mouth is filled with a zingy texture. It’s a light and easy-drinking cider that suits being well chilled. Drink it for refreshment at a picnic, or treat it as a dessert cider to be enjoyed with Eton mess or summer pudding. Full-bodied and spiced: Thatchers Rascal Imagine if apple pie came in a glass. Rascal is the cider equivalent, with a scrumptious array of flavours including red apples, pears, demerara sugar and spice. Created with a blend of cider apple stalwarts – redstreak, dabinett and tremlett’s bitter – this bold cider contains tannins that give the cider a fuller mouthfeel than the ciders made with eating or dessert apples. Tannins attract fats and proteins, cut through the texture of dense and fatty food and refresh the mouth. So pair with hearty meals such as a Sunday roast or mac and cheese, followed by apple crumble and custard. Equally, this is an excellent sitting-in-your-favourite-pub-and-chatting with your friends type of cider.

I didn’t think about the terroir of grape-growing, the nose of whisky or what wine to pair with raw tilapia. On sunny days, I just thought about the most enjoyable way to quench my thirst. Now, the clank of a metal bottle opener and the hiss of a cold Thatchers Cider opening is enough to bring me back to the Meadows in Edinburgh, for a post-lecture picnic with friends. Stretched out on the grass as the rays warm my skin, the air is filled with the smoky smell of barbecue. Summer walks have been made all the sweeter with a sip of cider at the end. Arriving at a sweep of beach, blanket at the ready, or settling at the end of a pier as the sun sets. The cool fizz of cider tickling down my throat while the sky streaks violet and hazy pink is an unbeatable feeling. On an emotional level, clinking bottles with a friend at the end of the day is the perfect reward. On a practical level, a couple of bottles of ice-cold Thatchers in your rucksack on the way to the sea cools your back – ideal. Cider is the taste of a barbecue with my family – the only way we were allowed to see each other in summer 2020. My dad cooked venison burgers for the first time, an attempt to impress me, the “food and drink writer”, making jokes about not wanting a bad review. Despite the burger buns being a bit frozen in the middle, I gave it 1010. The sun was shining, family was gathered, the cider was flowing and for a brief second it felt like normality again. The epitome of the “better times” we’re all looking forward to. I can’t always suppress the drinks writer in me and did have to note that the iron-y tang of venison burgers goes particularly well with the light sweetness of Thatchers Katy. On the slopes of the Mendip Hills, Thatchers grows 458 different varieties of apple in perfect conditions – more than 25 varieties of them are used for ciders. The autumnal rain, summer sun and lack of winter frost combine to create juicy, flavour-filled apples. They have a cider for every taste bud: sharp and cloudy, sweet and pink. As a drinks writer, I’ve sampled more ciders than I care to remember. Thatchers Katy is the choice for sunny days and balmy nights. While Thatchers’ other ciders are made from a combination of different types of apple, Thatchers Katy is made from just one type. Red as a fairytale apple and sweet as strawberries, Katy apples are the pride of the crop and first to be run through the mill. It’s what you want to be drinking to get that real thirst-quenching moment, with only a hint of sweetness that doesn’t overpower. It sits between sweet and dry, with a crisp finish, so it’s incredibly drinkable. Being an apple-based drink, it goes best with anything pork. But its lightness also carries well with salads and summer food. Think charcuterie boards laden with spicy salami, salty prosciutto, and garlicky mortadella. The slight sweetness to Thatchers Katy cuts through the saltiness of prosciutto beautifully. Hand-held picnic food – scotch eggs, sausage rolls, and pork pies – tends to be savoury-heavy, so goes down a treat with a sweet cider, paired best with a sunset view, of course. But it also mixes well with fruity dishes – a salad sprinkled with glistening pomegranate seeds and topped with ripe avocado. The delicate fizz works particularly well with the creamy squish of avocado. Meat and salad, barbecues and picnic food it’s as though Thatchers Katy was designed for summer. So, it’s no wonder cider is the British summer drink of choice it pairs naturally with grilled meat and fruity salads, it’s easy to drink, and that hit of sweet apple sings of good times. For me, cider evokes memories of barbecues with friends and family, sunsets over the sea and picnics in the park, and Thatchers Katy is my cider of choice this summer, for its strawberry sweetness and crisp finish. If you need me, I’ll be sipping a cold cider in the park, or on my way to the shore, two bottles clinking away and cooling my back. To better times.

Russia’s official national tally shows there have been 4,992,554 cases since the pandemic began, as well as 118,125 deaths.NHS test and trace is providing additional testing and genomic sequencing in education settings and targeted areas across the four boroughs, following the identification of the B1.617.2 strain. Public Health England has classified B1.617.2 as a variant of concern. The cases have been told to self-isolate and their contacts are being traced. Local authorities will shortly confirm the areas where additional testing will be offered within the boroughs.  Everyone who lives, works or studies in the targeted areas, including children, are being urged to take a PCR test, regardless of whether they have symptoms.The UK Hospitality chief executive, Kate Nicholls, said it would be “a long road to recovery” as many businesses continued to make losses under the current restrictions. She told BBC Breakfast: “The first week has not been as exceptional as we had when we first opened outdoors and there was that rush to come back. “We are looking at what the numbers will look like this weekend – that will be critical.”The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said the programme had helped identify the need for surge testing in areas such as Bristol and Luton. On Wednesday, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, said testing and vaccinations were being surged in six areas as a result of wastewater analysis. “As infections fall and we head out of national restrictions, analysing wastewater to detect variants early on is important to help local authorities and NHS test and trace act quickly to stop variants from spreading in communities,” said Andrew Engeli, who is leading on the wastewater testing scheme at the Joint Biosecurity Centre, part of the newly formed UK Health Security Agency. The health minister, Chen Shih-chung, also announced 400 infections over the past six days which had not been included in previous reports due to a delay following a spike in cases, according to Reuters. He reported two new deaths, bringing the total to 17 since the pandemic began.People aged 32 and 33 in England are now eligible to book their vaccine appointment, the NHS has said. People aged 33 will receive texts inviting them to book a vaccination from Saturday, and 32-year-olds will receive a message from Monday. Since eligibility was widened for under-40s just over a week ago, more than half of people between 35 and 39 have had their first shot, NHS chief executive Sir Simon Stevens said. He added: “Today, the biggest NHS vaccination programme in history hits another milestone as we pass 50 million life-saving jabs delivered across England.” Dr Nikki Kanani, GP and national medical director for primary care, reminded people that the vaccine offer “doesn’t go away” and they can take it up at any time. Text invitations appear as an alert from ‘NHSvaccine’, including a web link to the NHS website to reserve an appointment.

Since then, over 250,000 people have been diagnosed in the State, and more than 4,900 people have died.Globally, over 150 million people have been diagnosed and over 3\u0026nbspmillion have died since the virus was first identified in China in December 2019.Four of these have been authorised for use in the EU - one from AstraZeneca, one from BioNTech-Pfizer, one from Moderna and another from Johnson \u0026amp Johnson (Jannsen).The EU has put in place purchase agreements with Sanofi-GSK\u0026nbspand Curevac, and\u0026nbsphas concluded exploratory talks with two other vaccine producers - Novavax and Valneva.Ireland, along with all other EU member states, will get a proportional amount of every vaccine that is approved for use by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) according to its population.But how do these other vaccines work, and when will they be approved for use here? Have there been any reported side effects? And when can you expect to receive a vaccine?The  Vaccine Tracker will be updated daily as the country embarks on the largest inoculation programme in the history of the State.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 70°C.EMA approval: Granted on December 21st.Overview: Developed by New York-based Pfizer and German company BioNTech this vaccine has a brand name of Comirnaty. It uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which has instructions for producing a protein from Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The person’s immune system recognises this protein as foreign and produces antibodies and activates T-cells (white blood cells) to attack it, giving them immunity. The vaccine will last for six months when stored at -70C, and five days when stored at between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. The EU has approved the withdrawal of six doses from each vial.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle and joint pain, chills and fever. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 546,000 in April, 738,000 in May and\u0026nbsp844,000 doses in June, with 5.4 million doses in total expected by the end of 2021.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 20°C.EMA approval: Granted on January 6th.Overview: Developed by Boston-based company Moderna, this vaccine is manufactured for EU states at partner plants in Switzerland, France and Spain before being distributed across the continent. Like the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, it uses mRNA technology to produce a Sars-CoV-2 protein, which the body then attacks to give immunity. It will last for up to six months when stored at - 20°C. The first Moderna vaccine was given in Ireland on January 16th.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, chills, fever, swollen or tender lymph nodes under the arm, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea and vomiting. Less common was redness, hives and rash at the injection site. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 383,000 by June and 870,000 doses by the end of 2021.How many have been vaccinated here?EMA approval: Granted on January 29th.Overview: The OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine (also known as Vaxzevria) was thought of as a potential game-changer because it can be transported and stored at 2 degrees to 8 degrees for up to six months, making it much easier to move around and administer. It is also much cheaper, costing about $3-4 per shot, compared with $20 for the PfizerBioNTech jab, with the former being made on a not-for-profit basis for the duration of the pandemic.It is based on a harmless chimp cold virus that cannot grow inside human cells. Scientists have tweaked this virus so that it carries genetic material containing the instructions for a protein of the coronavirus. Once the vaccine has been administered, our bodies produce the coronavirus protein, triggering an immune response.During the trial, a dosing error led to the serendipitous finding that when clinical trial participants were given half a dose followed by a full dose, the vaccine had a higher efficacy than when participants were given two full doses, with 90 per cent efficacy in the former case and 62 per cent efficacy in the latter. This led AstraZeneca to announce in November a new global trial of the vaccine with the half dosefull dose regime.In January, a bitter row broke out between the European Union and AstraZeneca after the pharmaceutical company drastically revised downwards the number of doses it could deliver the bloc.\u0026nbspWhile the EMA approved the use of this vaccine for all ages, doubt was cast over its efficacy in the over 65s due to the lack of data from Astrazeneca’s clinical trials in this cohort. As a result, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Poland and Belgium have opted not to approve this product for their older population.Following suit, Ireland has also decided to use the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine for the over 70s where possible, not the AstraZeneca jab.It would not be the first time this jab led to a\u0026nbspsignificant reorganisation of our vaccination plans.Reports of serious blood clots, mostly in women aged under 60, led the\u0026nbspNational Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac) to first defer the use of the vaccine on March 14th, before resuming it\u0027s use on March 20th.However, on April 12th, Niac\u0026nbsprecommended that AstraZeneca should not be given to people aged under 60, once again leading to a reorganisation of the rollout. This was revised to people aged over 50 on April 27th.\u0026nbspHow many will Ireland get?\u0026nbspLatest projections are 224,000 in April, 262,000 in May and 327,000 in JuneStorage: Lasts for up to two years frozen at –20° C, and up to three months refrigerated at 2–8° C.EMA approval: Approved on March 11th.Overview: The EMA started a rolling review of this single dose vaccine from Janssen, the Belgium-based subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson on December 1st .On January 29th the company announced the results of its Phase 3 trial: the vaccine had an efficacy of 72 per cent in the United States, 66 per cent in Latin America, and 57 per cent in South Africa.This vaccine uses double-stranded DNA to deliver a protein from the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the body, thereby creating immunity. It is different from others on the market in that it requires just one injection. The EU has agreed an initial contract for 200 million doses, with an option to buy 200 million more.On February 16th the company applied to the EMA for\u0026nbspseeking authorisation for its single-dose vaccine, and it was approved on March 11th.However, on April 13th the company paused deliveries of its vaccine in Europe pending an investigation of rare blood clot cases that have halted its rollout in the US. The blood clotting conditions reported in recipients of the Johnson \u0026amp Johnson vaccine in the US are the same rare condition linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine.On April 20th, the EMA\u0027s review of these issues found a possible link to very rare cases of unusual blood clots with low blood platelets, and agreed a warning should be included in the product information.\u0026nbspHowever, it concluded\u0026nbspthe overall benefits of the vaccine\u0026nbspin preventing Covid-19 outweigh the risks of side effects, and so Janssen announced it would resume deliveries to the EU. In Ireland,\u0026nbspNiac recommended that the jab be used only for people over the age of 50.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbsp2.2 million doses in total,\u0026nbsp600,000 between April and June.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: US company Novavax has developed a Covid-19 vaccine which stimulates an immune response by delivering spike proteins into the body. These spike-proteins are grown and harvested from insects. Similar technology is used in the production of vaccines for influenza and HPV. The European Commission has concluded exploratory talks with Novavax with a view to purchasing up to 200 million doses. The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 3rd.Overview: In September the EU signed a deal to purchase 300 million doses of this vaccine. It is based on the same technology as one of Sanofi’s seasonal influenza vaccines - more conventional than the mRNA used by Pfizer and Moderna - and it was thought it could play a big role in ending the pandemic. However, despite positive results from Phase 1 trials, news came in December that Phase 2 trial results showed an insufficient immune response in older adults. Phase III studies were expected to start in December, but the companies now plan to begin a phase 2b study in February with a different formulation of the vaccine. Even if their new formulation is successful, they do not expect the vaccine to be available until the end of 2021.Storage: Will last for at least 3 months at 2–8°C.Overview: The German company CureVac began its final Phase 3 trials in December, with results expected in the first quarter of 2021. It uses the same mRNA technology as the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, but can be kept at normal refrigerator temperatures. The company has signed a deal with the EU to supply 405 million doses, pending regulatory approval.The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 12th.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: Valneva is a French company which has created a Covid-19 vaccine based on their Japanese encephalitis vaccine. It delivers a chemically inactivated coronavirus and uses an adjuvant (immunity booster) to create immunity. It entered clinical trials in December and reported positive results from these initial phase 1 and 2 trial in\u0026nbspApril 2021, while announcing it was entering\u0026nbspphase 3 trials on 4,000 people.On January 12th the European Commission concluded exploratory talks with the company for the supply of 30 million doses, with the option to buy a further 30 million.When might you be vaccinated?The HSE is currently vaccinating people in the top nine cohorts:\u0026nbsppeople aged 65\u0026nbspand older who live in long-term care facilities (cohort 1), frontline healthcare workers (cohort 2), people aged 70 and older (cohort 3), people aged 16 to 69 who are at very high or high risk (cohort 4 and 7) and those aged 50 to 69 (cohorts 5 and 9).\u0026nbspThe next groups to be offered a vaccine after this will be residents of long-term care facilities aged 16-64 (cohort 8), followed by people aged 64 years and younger, alongside people aged 64 and younger who are living or working in crowded settings.

Photograph: EPAYuri GripasUS president Joe Biden has said remarks made by Taoiseach Micheál Martin brought home to him how badly Donald Trump had handled the Covid-19 pandemic.Mr Biden told The New York Times in an interview that the Trump administration’s response to Covid-19 had threatened to take away America’s status as the world’s leading nation.“We’re kind of at a place where the rest of the world is beginning to look to China, ” Mr Biden said. “The most devastating comment made after I was elected — it wasn’t so much about me — but it was by the Irish taoiseach” — prime minister — “saying that ‘Well, America can’t lead. They can’t even get their arms around Covid.’”The comments are something of a mystery as there is no public record of the Taoiseach saying such a thing, although it is possible they were said privately.A search on the Nexis media archive of major US news outlets do not reveal any comments similar to those attributed to the Taoiseach by President Biden.The Government made no official comment on the matter on Friday.Mr Biden told New York Times opinion columnist David Brooks that human dignity was important to Irish people because of their historical experiences.“I think the Irish most often use the world ‘dignity’ of any other group of people,” he said. “I think it’s because when you’ve been deprived of dignity you put a high, high premium on it.”Alluding to the waves of Irish emigration to the United States in the mid 19th century, he talked about how white Protestants of English origin looked down on the Catholic Irish.“To be Irish was to be second class,” he recalls. “The English owned the town.”Mr Biden’s great-great grandfather Patrick Blewitt left Ireland in the autumn of 1850 to settle in America.Mr Biden’s other great-great grandfather was Owen Finnegan, from the Cooley Peninsula, Co Louth. He married Jean Boyle in 1839. The first four children were born there, including James Finnegan in 1840, Mr Biden’s great grandfather.In the interview, Mr Biden spoke of how 20th century Catholic social teaching influenced his worldview. He said that his father loved the French Catholic philosopher Jacques Maritain with his emphasis on social solidarity and the interdependence of people.The world was experiencing a “fourth industrial revolution”, Mr Biden said, and the huge spending programme approved by Congress reflected that.“I think circumstances have changed drastically.

TDs and Senators will remain in their taxpayer-funded €20,000-plus per day Covid-19 bolthole in Dublin’s Convention Centre until at least September, if Oireachtas management has its way.But the politicians do not want this. They want out and back to Leinster House.Last week the Dáil’s Business Committee agreed on sittings resuming in the Dáil chamber on Tuesday and Thursday, using the Convention Centre on Wednesday for block voting. However, they postponed a formal decision until this week because the Oireachtas Service wanted to “bring in the big guns”, as one member put it.Public health expert Dr John Cuddihy advised that the safest option was to stay put until the summer recess, with a possible return to Kildare Street in September. The committee adjourned the matter until next week as members wanted consult with their parties in light of the advice.“Of course it’s safer. We’re in this big, huge, massive, cavernous building, but they are looking for a level of safety that nobody else has,” said another committee member. “Politically, we can’t stand over it. People are starting to say: what the hell are you doing spending 20-odd thousand a day, what the hell are you at when retail shops are open, people are heading back to work and loads of people are already vaccinated?”On Tuesday, Sinn Féin’s Pádraig Mac Lochlainn put on the Dáil record that representatives of all parties and groups agreed on a return to the Dáil chamber at their last Business Committee meeting. TDs are already working every day from their offices in Leinster House, he pointed out.His party is calling for a quick return to business in Kildare Street. “That’s the view of Sinn Féin. We’re saying it openly and we’re willing to challenge the advice.“The rationale is that TDs and Senators are all in Leinster House anyway, going back and forth between the two venues. I respect the concerns of some but the difficulty now, as retail shops are open and vaccinations are moving on, people expect us to be back in work properly with no cotton wool wrapped around us. We have to accept that if we are asking other people to go back to work and get back to normality, then the Dáil has to reflect that.”Aontú’s Peadar Tóibín also called for the repatriation of the Dáil. He said the daily cost of sittings in the Convention Centre was €25,000, “a shockingly high figure”.Meanwhile, Michael Ring says he has tabled a motion for next Wednesday’s Fine Gael parliamentary party meeting urging colleagues to back a return to Leinster House.“I’ve enough of it. So has everyone else.“They expect teachers to go into classrooms, some of them with over 30 pupils. And there’s 160 TDs but we’re so precious now, we’re so precious, we have to be treated differently and it’s costing a fortune. We’re all supposed to be in this together. If we are opening up the country we should be leading by example and moving to the Dáil to where we were elected.”Committee members say they have received letters from unions representing senior civil servants, urging against moving back. “They’re basically holding the line and that is it can’t be business as usual,” said one. “Well, it is – it’s parliament, our national parliament and we are sitting on a full schedule now. We’ve a job to do and a backlog of legislation.“There’s a clash between the senior civil servants and the politicians, that’s the truth and the Ceann Comhairle is refereeing it. We have to get back into the Dáil chamber again. We’ve reduced numbers already, we’re not sitting cheek by jowl. We’re well separated. It’s perfectly safe.”Michael Ring blames the Oireachtas management for keeping them out. “I mean, everybody is against the Convention Centre now. It’s not just me.“The Dáil is no longer for the members. It’s a disgrace.“The senior civil servants are running the Dáil and they’re running everything. They are not elected – we are.“They just want an easy life and don’t want us in the way. It’s like a little dictatorship. Jesus Christ, it’s worse than Putin in there.”Was that the real Pearse Doherty or was it Memorex?There was a major fit of the vapours at this week’s Fine Gael parliamentary party meeting, the one where a real live Fianna Fáil Minister was allowed cross the hallowed threshold to tell TDs and Senators what he is doing to tackle the housing crisis.Darragh O’Brien was the FF gurrier they bravely invited to breach the inner sanctum. If nothing else, such selfless action by distinguished FG members would drive home how utterly serious the party is about dealing with this huge political issue.It was a virtual meeting, so they didn’t have to turn the Michael Collins pictures around to face the wall or sit beside an actual Fianna Fáil person in the party rooms or anything awful like that.As it turned out, the Minister for Housing, who is an affable chap, got along quite well with his Coalition colleagues.They really warmed to him after he gave Sinn Féin a ferocious lash, declaring their housing policies don’t stand up to scrutiny. Senator Mary Seery-Kearney was next. She began talking about the lack of affordability in the market.All of a sudden, a furious roar from Sinn Féin’s spokesman on finance exploded into the meeting.It was the unmistakable boom of Pearse Doherty, deputy for decibels and Donegal.“...at what has been happening for many years in terms of deliberate policy by this Government which has locked generations out of the housing market!”Bad enough having to tolerate a Fianna Fáil Minister in their midst, but now this? Hacked by Shinner Wizard Spiderbabies at their supposedly private weekly whinge-in?Seery-Kearney stopped dead. “Jaysis, they’ve also let Pearse Doherty into our parliamentary party meeting.”“Now that’s a real reach,” smirked Fianna Fáil interloper O’Brien, highly amused. “Did Charlie Flanagan invite him too?”It was just a little technical blip – someone playing back audio above in the office and forgetting they were still on the call.Or was it? Politicians are naturally suspicious. As one Fine Gael TD remarked afterwards: “Bizzare... accidentally or on purpose? Hard to tell.”Ideologically driven to despairThe word “ideology” has been bandied about a lot in the last few weeks.The Government berating Opposition TDs for their ideologically driven hostility to the erse range of measures needed resolve the housing crisis.The Opposition berating Government for its ideologically driven approach to favouring competition and the private market over State provision of housing on State lands.When the crisis was discovered three weeks ago on foot of a newspaper story about an investment fund buying up new homes in a Kildare commuter belt estate, the Government responded swiftly to public anger by promising to curb the practice.It was a matter of such urgency that “a whole-of-government approach” was solemnly promised, with Ministers rolled out to announce that this great new weapon against half-arsed Government approaches had suddenly been unearthed in Merrion Street.Proper houses with front doors for real families became the focus for Government action. The whole of Government – aka a somewhat reluctant Paschal Donohoe and his straining purse strings – duly appeared in the Dáil on Thursday night with new stamp duty rates for bulk purchases of certain homes. Apartments, now almost exclusively the preserve of the investment funds, were not included.Apartments? Sure they’re only love-nests for students and transient types and old people who can’t manage stairs in real houses anymore.On Wednesday, Gary Gannon of the Social Democrats echoed Opposition anger over the decision to exempt them from stamp duties and planning restrictions.“How can anybody who lives in an urban centre such as mine in Dublin Central see that as anything other than an abandonment of our city centres as a place to live, or to aspire to own an apartment and raise a family? I cannot for the life of me understand why we can have one particular set of rules for suburbia and another for the city centres.”It isn’t an abandonment of anybody, insisted Micheál Martin. There is simply an issue with supply.“Lower the rents!” shouted Gary.“But what we have done now with the 10 per cent stamp duty is we’ve made a far better situation for first-time buyers of houses and duplexes,” said the Taoiseach.“What about apartments?”“We need to build more apartments.”The docklands Dáil in Dublin’s financial district is surrounded by apartment blocks. “Taoiseach, look up when you walk outside. Over €2,000 for each of those,” said the TD, despairingly.The Government has made a good start but a lot more needs to be done, conceded Micheál. This won’t happen “if we end up in endless ideological warfare, which seems to be the only proposition coming from you and others”.“But your ideology has led to the housing crisis. The hands-off, developer-led approach has led to the housing crisis,” retorted Gary.Socialist Paul Murphy can’t resist a bit of ideology.He rose to speak. Couldn’t stop laughing.“It’s noteworthy that the Taoiseach is the only man in the building without an ideology,” he chuckled. “It’s quite striking: the best kind of ideology – when you don’t admit that it’s an ideology.”Speaking of which, Micheál’s Coalition partners have an ideology too. The Greens are in pain over this blanket apartment decision – sustainable homes for families in a living city is what they want to encourage.You could see party leader Eamon Ryan struggling to hold the line in the Dáil.Some tweaking of measures will have to be done."},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons may 2021","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2020 by clicking here or call 0844 871 1514. To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178Covid lockdown roadmap: what you can and can\u0026#39t do as restrictions easeGermany to ban British travellers amid fears over Indian variantCan Joe Biden still lift sanctions on Iran after the bloodshed in Israel?Fishermen beg to tackle invasion of monstrous catfish conquering EuropeComment: Britain\u0026#39s troubled wedding industry cannot take much more delayComment: The public won’t buy the Leavers for Lockdown’s bid to rewrite historyTesting and tracing of sewage ramped up to tackle Covid variantsComment: America has chosen to be free.

It was one of the first countries in the world to do so, given concerns its public health system would buckle if mass disease spread.“We’ve been here for a few days already and will probably be here until early June,” an inspector told the  in mid-May. He is on a team of eight that will soon cross to the North Korean side to examine the bridge, though officials from both sides are still negotiating terms. China has reaffirmed its alliances with nations including North Korea and Russia after the US began pursuing more multilateral engagement. Under President Joe Biden, the US has ramped up efforts to court Asian allies, including Japan and South Korea, in efforts to bolster cooperation on the North Korean nuclear threat and China’s growing influence. On Friday, Mr Biden will welcome South Korean President Moon Jae-in to Washington for an official visit. The meeting could shed light on the US approach, as the Biden administration has been reviewing how to deal with North Korea – with more sanctions, summits or both. The visit also comes as ties between Washington and Beijing have frayed, potentially making China less inclined to collaborate on dealing with North Korea – even though its leaders are concerned about the nuclear threat. China’s ties to the North helped to blunt the impact of United Nations sanctions meant to deter Kim Jong-un’s nuclear ambitions. Smuggling routes and legal trade along the 880-mile border supplied North Korean markets and factories with building materials, machine parts, fuel, food and consumer goods. But the North’s decision to seal its border over coronavirus concerns has been crippling. From January 2020 through the first quarter of this year, China’s official trade with North Korea crashed to $550 million (£400 million), compared to $2.8 trillion in 2019. Chinese exports to North Korea dropped to $3,000 in February, the lowest in years. “Clearly the situation inside, in North Korea, is dire, so it stands to reason we’re at a point that some relaxation (of the border closure) might happen,” said Scott Snyder, senior fellow for Korea Studies at the US-based Council on Foreign Relations. Re-opening trade with China could also indicate that North Korea may ramp up weapons testing again, after a relatively quieter period during the coronavirus pandemic. ”They’re not testing not because they’ve had a change of heart, but because they’re dealing with domestic crises,” said John Park, director of the Korea Project at Harvard University’s Kennedy School of Government. “They hit the pause button, and if they stabilise and are going to open up bits of trade, that’s a sign they’ve figured out a way to manage this.”Then, “does that mean they take their fingers off the pause button? Does that mean they go back to doing what they said they were going to do before Covid, and that was to demonstrate more potent capabilities?”North Korea has recently again started using shows of force, firing off two short-range ballistic missiles in March – its first such launches in a year, and in defiance of UN Security Council bans on ballistic missile tests. Rumours among traders in Dandong on when border crossings might be allowed again range from next month to early next year. Exactly when depends on the North’s risk appetite with coronavirus. Officially, Pyongyang has told the World Health Organisation that it has had zero cases, though experts doubt the veracity of its claims. Either way, there are signs in the city – spliced from the hermit kingdom by the Yalu River, lined with watchtowers and border guards with guns and masks – that China is laying the groundwork for trading with North Korea.The government of Liaoning province, where Dandong is located, invited bids in March for the safety inspection the  found was underway. Official procurement documents said that the New Yalu River Bridge – a three-kilometre stretch connecting China to North Korea – was “about to be put into operation.Another tender notice, also from March, sought contractors to build a cargo inspection area, logistics warehouse and other facilities to support port operations on the Chinese side of the bridge. Many in Dandong are eager for the border to re-open and activity to resume. Three street vendors told the  that they were running out of smuggled North Korean cigarettes to sell. Few restaurants stock Taedonggang, a beer produced by a state-owned North Korean brewery.Shopkeepers, desperate to make a sale, are quick to offer discounts to passersby – soaps, perfumes, noodles, handbags, and vitamins that North Koreans going back and forth used to buy. An elderly woman who tailors traditional Korean robes was praying in her shop one morning for customers to return.Before the border closure, North Koreans would place large orders for colourful outfits ranging from 170 yuan (£20) for children to 3,600 yuan (£400) for high-end women’s dresses. But these days she’s lucky to sell smaller textiles, such as makeup pouches for 10 yuan (£1.10) each, to Chinese tourists. “Business has been terrible,” she said, making it difficult to cover her monthly shop rent of 3,000 yuan (£330). “I hope the border opens soon.”  More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"beano replace character fatty freddy stop children using name","story":"It is Britain’s longest-running children’s comic which brought to life enduring characters such as Dennis the Menace and Minnie the Minx.However, The Beano has now decided to stop using the name of one of its most popular personalities to avoid offending young readers.From this week\u0027s issue (number 4087), the character Frederick Brown will no longer be referred to as \u0027Fatty in The Bash Street Kids comic strip.Instead he will exclusively be called Freddy - or perhaps Frederick if he is being told off by his mother.The creators made the change 67 years after the character was first introduced in a bid to ensure fans are not upset if they are overweight, or to inadvertently encourage youngsters to poke fun at their peers who struggle with their weight.Mike Stirling, editorial director of Beano Studios, said: Kids come in all shapes and sizes, and we absolutely celebrate that. We don\u0027t want to risk someone using it in a mean way. The time is right to revert back to Freddy.“We\u0027ve recently received a number of letters from kids asking us why Frederick Brown was called Fatty, by himself and his classmates. Although it\u0027s always been used affectionately, and never pejoratively, we agreed it\u0027s time it changed. Freddy\u0027s mum - and teacher - may still sometimes address him as \u0027Frederick\u0027, whenever he\u0027s in trouble, which for a Bash Street Kid is not uncommon.Much like in 1954, when The Bash Street Kids were created based upon the hilarious antics spotted in the school yard outside of the Beano office, kids are still the inspiration for our characters and storylines and it\u0027s incredibly important to us that they see themselves and their lives reflected in Beanotown.”Run by Dundee-based publishing house DC Thomson since 1938, The Beano and its stablemate The Dandy are among the few surviving relics of Britain’s post-war comics boom.The Bash Street Kids characters in The Beano, illustrated by David Sutherland, are notoriously unruly nine-year-old pupils at Bash Street School. Fatty appears alongside Spotty, Danny, Toots, Sidney, Plug, ‘Erbert, Wilfrid and Smiffy.He is drawn as a morbidly obese, balding boy who carries around a bag of cakes. His prized possession is an apron signed by veteran television chef Mary Berry and his motto is \u0027Everything is delicious\u0027, according to his character profile.Mr Stirling insisted that Freddy will still be drawn in the same way, and won\u0027t be depicted thinner.All the characters overindulge at times, and Freddy is no different, he said.The Beano\u0027s move received a mixed reaction, with some arguing it was overzealous to drop the name Fatty and questioning how much of a role the comic could have really played in encouraging children to use the term as an insult for their overweight peers.Jacob Rees-Mogg, MP and Leader of the House of Commons, said: I expect it is just publicity seeking - otherwise it is comically woke.Others said it was a positive step, with one parent claiming the name had always jarred with her nine-year-old.Debbie Watson, founder of the eating disorder charity Wednesday’s Child, said it was helpful for popular publications to reflect on the message sent out by their content.“Any move which makes creators of literary, visual or social content consider how they are potentially impacting the self-esteem and mental wellbeing of their audience can only be seen as a good thing, she said.While we would never say that an eating disorder is solely caused by derogatory comments about a person’s size, it’s absolutely true that many adults we help, and indeed children, have found themselves triggered into developing poor relationships with food in a bid to escape the cruel labels they received.It seems only right that long-running publications like The Beano should want to reflect on what their characters are called, what message that sends, and whether it is appropriate for the kind of narrative we would want all young people to be using when talking about their friends or classmates.There is an opportunity in this move by the comic to ensure that they rethink not only the name of the character, but also how the storylines reflect the shape and size of all those who are part of The Bash Street Kids, because, as an eating disorder organisation, we continually feel the need to reiterate the message that people of all sizes and shapes can have a devastating eating disorder.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"binmen union submits emergency motion support suspended batley","story":"When a teacher was suspended from his school after showing a picture of the Prophet Mohammed in class, he reportedly felt as though he had been “thrown under a bus”.The National Education Union (NEU), was accused of failing to stand up for its own member after it did not immediately condemn the threats of violence and intimidation he faced in the wake of the row.But now, the Batley Grammar School religious studies teacher has found unlikely support from a Bury branch of Unite, which largely represents binmen.Brian Bamford, secretary of Tameside Trade Union Council, has submitted an emergency motion for the National Conference of Trade Union Councils in June to champion the cause of the suspended teacher.The motion urges the NEU and all other unions to support the teacher and to publicly condemn those demanding his dismissal.It notes that blasphemy laws were abolished more than a decade ago, and adds that “dogmatic restraints” should not be imposed on the religious education  curriculum.Mr Bamford is also secretary of Bury Unite commercial branch in the North West, which represents binmen across the borough, and the motion’s wording had to be approved by the branch committee before being passed up to the Tameside TUC which it is affiliated to.This is a motion which has come in from bin men, from ordinary working people, said Mr Bamford, a retired electrician who has been active in the trade union movement since the 1970s.“As far as I can see, staying silent goes contrary to what we believe in at our branch, and especially in the trade congress.“We are affiliated to the Orwell Society and freedom of expression is very important. I don’t feel guilty in any way for taking a stand on this issue.”Mr Bamford claimed that an NEU official attempted to pressurise him into withdrawing the motion on the basis that it was “unhelpful” to draw further attention to the issue.He said he was phoned by the official who asked him to reconsider the motion since it risks inflaming what is an extremely sensitive and very complex situation for members.Mr Bamford was told that the NEU has an obligation to the “wider community in Batley and that any further attention on the matter would set back quite sensitive negotiations.But he said he has no intention of abandoning the motion, adding that the school curriculum should not be “dictated by an indignant mob” who congregated outside Batley Grammar School just before the Easter break.“We are troubled that a teacher can be suspended following protests about his teaching methods and use of materials,” Mr Bamford said.“We are outraged that the teachers involved are being challenged for trying to broaden their students\u0027 horizons and encourage their critical thought.“We don\u0027t believe that the determination of the use of teaching resources in a school should be influenced by people taking offence, and using intimidation and threats.”Batley Grammar School sent pupils home early for the Easter holidays and issued an apology after a group of Muslims gathered at the gates to protest. The headmaster announced that the religious studies teacher had been suspended while the school looked into what happened.The 29-year-old teacher and his family went into hiding after reportedly receiving death threats in the wake of the protests. The academy trust that runs Batley Grammar School announced at the end of March that it would carry out an “independent” investigation into the context in which the cartoon was shown.A by-election has been triggered in Batley after Tracy Brabin stepped down as MP when she was elected as West Yorkshire\u0027s first metro mayor.Ms Brabin, 60, replaced Jo Cox as Batley and Spen MP in a by-election in 2016 after Ms Cox was murdered by a far-right extremist. The seat will be seen as a key test for Labour after the party lost the Hartlepool by-election to the Conservatives earlier this month.An NEU spokesperson said: It is a sensitive issue and the NEU did ask for the motion to be withdrawn. With every viewpoint that is expressed our members face yet more public exposure.They added that speculation is unhelpful, not least for our members who the NEU are fully supporting throughout this investigation and will be doing so beyond the investigation. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"homeowners may have improve energy efficiency selling new green","story":"Homeowners may have to make energy efficiency improvements when selling or renovating their homes under Government plans to phase out gas boilers. New targets for owner occupiers to improve the energy performance certificate (EPC) rating in their home could see homeowners required to insulate their lofts or walls, or install triple glazing. The Government wants to see new gas boilers phased out by the mid-2030s at the latest, with the CCC calling for a ban on sales from 2028, and will lay out its plans to decarbonise heating in its upcoming heat and buildings strategy.As part of a consultation within the strategy, the Government is expected to outline options for improving EPC ratings in owner-occupied homes within the coming years. Buildings account for 17 per cent of the UK’s greenhouse gas emissions, mostly from the use of gas for heating and cooking. The Government wants to see heat pumps, which work like a refrigerator in reverse, replace the majority of gas boilers, with 600,000 installed from 2028. But to achieve lower carbon emissions requires the UK’s draughty housing stock to be retrofitted with insulation so that heat pumps can operate at a lower temperature. Measures to enforce new EPC ratings could include linking them to mortgages, or requiring lenders to achieve an average rating across their portfolio, or by providing upfront loans. The Government’s climate change advisers have called for all homes on the market to be EPC C by 2028, and for all those with mortgages by 2033. Some 19 million homes on the market currently have an EPC lower than C, and renovations could cost up to £18,000 for some older homes, according to the Environmental Audit Committee. Earlier this year the Government scrapped its flagship £1.5bn Green Homes Grant, which provided £5,000, or £10,000 to lower income households, to fund energy efficiency measures after just six months, and has no plans to replace it.  Plans for landlords to ensure private rented properties are EPC C by 2028 is already under consideration by the Government.The plans could include some overhaul of the EPC rating system, which has been criticised as inadequate and ineffective.Other plans include a requirement on heating appliance manufacturers to sell a minimum number of low-carbon heating solutions, similar to requirements on electric cars in California and the European Union. That could see the price of low-carbon heating come down in relation to gas boilers as manufacturers try to incentivise sales.The Government is also expected to announce plans to adjust taxes on energy bills, which currently fall overwhelmingly on electricity, making a heat pump more expensive to run than a gas boiler. It will also announce its hydrogen strategy in the upcoming weeks, which will lay out its plans for using the gas in home heating. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"latest conflict israel palestine had one winner iran","story":"The Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, boasts the Israeli Army has won its greatest victory. Hamas’s leader, Ismail Haniya, insists God has granted “defiant Gaza” victory. But who really won the war?Stepping back to look at the broader map of the Middle East, the worrying answer for the West is that it looks likely to be Iran. The ayatollahs’ local surrogates, Hamas, have survived the Israeli onslaught. In the process they have stress-tested the relationship between Israel and its most powerful ally. The cracks that have appeared between Netanyahu’s Israel and Biden’s America will have interested Tehran immensely. President Biden did not exactly abandon his country’s traditional allies. But his demand for an “unconditional ceasefire”, initially resisted by the Israelis, marked a sharp contrast with the usual rock solid support offered to Israel by Washington. US support for Israel’s security interests is shifting as the Biden team unravels the Trump foreign policy legacy. Nowhere was Trump more at odds with his predecessor and his predecessor’s vice-president than over the Middle East. Trump’s approach, of attempting to secure peace in the Middle East not by settling the question of Israel and Palestine but by uniting the region’s major powers around a shared distrust of Iran, led to remarkable results during his tenure. Now, however, the Obama-era orthodoxy has once again taken hold at the State Department. Aware that a “hardliner” is set to win the impending Iranian presidential election, “expert” opinion among Biden’s backers in Washington is that the President should hurry to reverse Trump’s withdrawal from the JCPOA before that happens. The thinking, which many would describe as hopelessly naive given past behaviour, is that this would “lock in” the Islamic Republic to its non-proliferation obligations. It is a good deal for Iran, with sanctions lifted and no restrictions on its research into the ancillary weapons systems necessary for an atomic weapon. What’s more, the restrictions even on enriching uranium, the final piece of the nuclear puzzle, are time-limited, too. Israel’s undeclared war on Iran’s nuclear programme is becoming a lonely one.Sensing Washington’s weakening stance on containing Iran, Saudi Arabia has opened “secret” talks with Tehran. This suggests that the Kingdom, having seen the treatment of Israel, is no longer confident of unequivocal US backing and is seeking to mend its fences with the Islamic Republic. This is a big step backwards from the rapprochement that took place between Israel and the Saudis under President Trump.That could mean Iran will rein in its Houthi allies in Yemen who have been firing missiles Hamas-style into Saudi Arabia, hitting its oil fields. Any ceasefire in Yemen, like in Gaza, will save civilian lives. The danger is that if Iran is the “peace-maker”, it can also be the “peace-breaker” when Tehran judges the moment right to resume conflict.The war between Israel and Gaza will have interested another Iranian proxy, too. Hizbollah in Lebanon did not feel the need to join in this time. But they will have been watching with interest how Israel’s Iron Dome worked against the Hamas rockets. Despite the Israeli Air Force’s repeated efforts to intercept weapons supplies to Hizbollah via Syria, Israel’s northern enemy has built up a much more formidable arsenal than Hamas had put together clandestinely in Gaza.US disengagement from the broader Middle East, including Afghanistan on Iran’s eastern flank, means the Islamic Republic is winning on points in the great game to decide the future of the region. Washington and the West pressured Israel to make peace but Iran will decide if it lasts. Mark Almond is director of the Crisis Research Institute, OxfordMore from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"ufo uap aliens report sightings us government encounters barack","story":"She has also had one of the most famous close encounters with a UFO, or Unidentified Flying Object.In separate planes, Lt Cdr Dietrich and Commander David Fravor were dispatched to investigate.What they saw on that day has never been adequately explained – until now.Cmdr Fravor aggressively engaged one of the oblong objects, which he estimated to be 40ft in length, while Lt Cdr Dietrich adopted “high cover” above.Ship radar picked it up seconds later, 60 miles away. A third FA-18 then caught it on an infrared camera: it looked like a giant white Tic Tac.Lt Cdr Dietrich decided to go public with her story now – three years after Cdr Fravor – to reduce the “stigma” associated with UFO reports and, she says, to encourage other pilots to come forward without feeling “embarrassed or ashamed”.Her testimony coincides with a growing acceptance among defence officials around the world that there may indeed be something “out there” – and that it might pose a genuine global security threat.After decades of doing everything possible to keep reported sightings secret, there has been a sea change in how the Pentagon regards such sightings.For starters, it no longer refers to them as UFOs – with their connotations of little green men – but to UAPs, or Unidentified Aerial Phenomena. Next month, Congress is to be given an unclassified report on evidence collected by the Pentagon’s UAP Task Force, the Office of Naval Intelligence and the FBI.Ufologists - people who investigate UFOs - across the globe are hailing it as an unprecedented watershed moment in their long quest to uncover what the US government really knows – and they have former president Donald Trump to thank for it.“We’re absolutely in new territory here,” says Nick Pope, who investigated UFO sightings while working as a British civil servant for the Ministry of Defence in the 1990s.“What’s really elevated this is the sheer number, and position, of people now speaking out, saying we’re dealing with something that must be taken seriously, he added.“When top guns, who don’t impress easily, get excited about the capability of these objects, their speed, manoeuvrability, trans-medium travel in water and air… that gets my attention.The pilot testimony is important, but there is so much more: radar data, infrared, measurement and signature intelligence… and we’ll get to see some of it.”John Ratcliffe, director of National Intelligence under President Trump, raised anticipation when he hinted recently that there was “a lot” more information than the public currently knows.He said he had seen satellite imagery of objects “frankly engaging in actions that are difficult to explain”, and incidents of them breaking the sound barrier with no sonic boom.The following month, a farmer found wreckage on a ranch near Roswell, New Mexico. In a press release, the US military called it a “flying disc”, but later said it was part of a weather balloon.By the 1950s, the US Air Force was being inundated with UFO reports from the public. One of the most notorious was the so-called “Invasion of Washington” in 1952, when numerous sightings were made over the capital in a two-week period.It was the Cold War, and the CIA, fearing mass hysteria could play into the hands of the Soviet Union, worked to debunk sightings and infiltrate UFO-hunting groups.“Further extensive study of UFOs probably cannot be justified,” it said.For decades afterwards, anyone who reported seeing something strange in the sky was considered a crackpot – even leading lights in the US military.However, there remained a few highly influential figures who believed a mystery was there to be solved. The most powerful among them was Senator Harry Reid, the Democrat leader in the US Senate from 2005 to 2017.In 2007, Mr Reid managed to push through Congress, clandestinely, $22 million in “black ops” funding for a new department. It was innocuously named the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP).From a fifth-floor office deep inside the Pentagon, a real-life X-Files team studied hundreds of reported UFO sightings – including the USS Nimitz “Tic Tac” incident from 2004.The department was led by Luis Elizondo, a career intelligence official who later resigned because he felt his findings were not being taken seriously enough.Shortly after his departure in late 2017, Mr Elizondo told the  how his team established geographical “hot spots” for sightings, sometimes near nuclear facilities, and common ways in which UFOs moved.“We began to see trends and similarities in incidents – very distinct observables. Extreme manoeuvrability, hypersonic velocity without a sonic boom, speeds of 8,000mph. A lot of this was supported by radar signal data, gun camera footage from aircraft, multiple witnesses.”He said he came to a “realisation that these are probably not any type of aircraft in any national inventory. I think it’s pretty clear it’s not us. So one has to ask the question where they’re from.”He also added: “There was never any display of hostility.”A key moment in the UFO debate – and whether it should be taken seriously – came in 2017 when the New York Times published the infrared video of the “Tic Tac” sighting. Ufologists felt vindicated, not least because it proved the Pentagon had seen fit to investigate the incident.Today, thanks to lockdown – which provided a dramatic reduction in light pollution coupled with an army of people with empty evenings on their hands – supposed UFO sightings have proliferated around the globe.In the UK alone, reports of suspected alien spacecraft doubled last year.And once-secret intelligence just keeps coming. Last month, footage of bizarre images of flashing pyramid-shaped UFOs was posted online, which the Pentagon confirmed was taken in 2019, by a US Navy ship off California.Another leaked video, taken from a fighter jet in 2015, showed a small object moving at tremendously high speed just above the water off Virginia on the US east coast. Pilots could be heard yelling: “Oh my gosh, dude” and “Wow! What is that, man? Look at that flying!”In another incident, pilots reported seeing an object that looked like a cube inside a sphere flying between their aircraft, which were barely 100ft apart.Many of these incidents are expected to be further detailed in next month’s report. But even though it will be “unclassified”, it\u0027s still unclear exactly how much will come out.“I don’t expect it’ll plunge into extraterrestrial visitation. If there is anything really juicy, it will probably be in the classified annex.

Flights are full. Bars and restaurants are flourishing. Conversations are no longer about where to book a vaccine, but where to book a vacation. While Britain dithers about whether to fully re-open on June 21, America has already decided to get on with normal life.Many states, such as Texas, Florida or my own adopted home state of Mississippi, repealed state-wide mandates requiring people to wear a mask weeks ago. Once ubiquitous shop signs telling us to stand six feet apart have largely gone. Even the most Left-wing teacher unions seem to be running out of excuses not to get back to work.Both Britain and America have been extraordinarily successful at inoculating their citizens against Covid. For every hundred people in the UK or the US, over 80 doses of vaccine have now been administered – and unlike some of the non-Western vaccines, it appears that these Anglo-American vaccines provide 90 per cent protection against symptomatic infection.Unsurprisingly, perhaps, as more and more people receive a jab, rates of infection are in free fall on either side of the Atlantic. Britain in particular now has one of the lowest rates of infection in the world.So why, when America is opening up again, does Britain seem so reluctant to get back to normal? Why, given that millions of Brits have now received a vaccine that protects them, is it government policy to be so cautious?Much has been written about so-called “vaccine hesitancy”. This is the idea that some people might prove reluctant to take the vaccine for all sorts of irrational reasons. It turns out that vaccine hesitancy is – while not quite non-existent – not really a major problem after all, especially in Britain, where pretty much everyone invited to take the vaccine has had it.No, Britain’s hesitancy problem is not an unwillingness on the part of the people to take the vaccine. Rather it is the reluctance of officialdom to allow folk, having had the vaccine, to get on with their lives. Public health officials still decide how many people you are allowed to meet with indoors, and from which households. Government rules might no longer determine if you are allowed to sit on a park bench, but they do still decree that some people should live inside a “support bubble”.In Britain, the slightest suggestion that there might be a new variant of the virus (that is what viruses do) seems to prompt yet another round of official alarmism. The so-called Indian variant, it has been suggested, could mean that Covid restrictions will have to stay in place just in case.To be fair, America has more than its fair share of officious officials, who would if they could still have every American wearing a mask. The federal authorities in Washington, notably the Centers for Disease Control, have been every bit as prescriptive as their British counterparts in wanting to decide what everyone else must do.But the whole point about the United States is that the federal government doesn’t get to decide what everyone else does. America is a federation of states, and the federal authorities don’t have the power to decide public policy across America.America is getting back to normal not because of the federal authorities, but despite them.Instead of asking why Britain seems so slow to return to normal, one should instead ask what is it about the US that allows much of the country to escape the worst excesses of officialdom.Alongside the federal government in Washington, America has 50 other governments, one in each state, able to decide their own rules to respond to the crisis. Sometimes, rather like the devolved administrations in Scotland or Wales, this has empowered local politicians to exercise their discretion in favour of more restrictions. The governors of California and New York state famously insisted that restrictions remain in place. But it also allowed states like Texas and Florida to do the opposite, and open up again quickly.This has given those states a powerful competitive advantage. Even before Covid, America’s economic centre of gravity was shifting south. Companies were beginning to move away from the traditional business clusters of New York, Chicago and California, towards states such as Texas, Tennessee and Florida. Covid – or to be more precise – the less restrictive response to it by many southern states, has accelerated this trend dramatically.Texas, which I visited this week, already has an economy almost as large as the whole of Italy’s. On current trends, it won’t be long before it is bigger than France. Florida is not that far behind. Even tiny South Dakota, whose outspoken governor Kristi Noem, refused to follow the federal line in dealing with Covid, now has the lowest rate of unemployment in the US.Britain, too, could have a similar kind of comparative advantage – if only we had the confidence and the optimism to seize the opportunity and open up again.Douglas Carswell is the President \u0026amp CEO of the Mississippi Center for Public Policy.

Native to the continent’s central and Eastern river basins.Many adults grow as long as 7ft and can weigh up to 143lb, lunging out of the water to catch their prey. The female produces up to 30,000 eggs per kilogram of body weight, and the spread of the species is crowding out rival fish.Since 72-year-old fisherman Manuel Ramírez first caught a catfish in Iznájar, he has noticed that other species have slowly decreased in number, with their average size shrinking too — a trend that has only accelerated in recent years.  “They eat everything,” sighs Mr Ramírez - fish, turtles, crabs, ducks and even, some say, dogs. Carlos Fernández, a Zoologist at the University of Cordoba, says if the catfish reach the Guadalquivir river basin they will devour everything in their path.“It’s an extraordinarily rich ecosystem — one of the richest that catfish have ever threatened in Spain,” he warns, pointing to the abundance of red crab, bass and anchovies.“It has a life expectancy of 30 years. As the third largest freshwater fish on earth, the catfish is no joking matter. Everyday they need to eat the equivalent of 2 per cent of their total weight. So that can be 2kg of whatever they find in their surroundings.”Environmentalists have called on the Andalucian government to intervene, to little avail. In the meantime Mr Fernández has provided Madrid with a draft of measures they could take to control the creatures’ spread.The government, he says, must use ‘scientific artillery’ to block the path of the fish, which has flourished in the region because of a lack of predators.He wants to undertake a thorough analysis of environmental DNA to understand the catfish population size and its spread, and use electrofishing techniques to attract the specimens, stun them, and take them out of the water.“They will fight back as an evolutionary unit, catfish have been evolving for millions of years,” warns Fernández.   Regional authorities did not respond to a request for comment.The catfish issue is not unique to southern Spain. In the Dordogne in France - home to thousands of Brits - local authorities have recently launched a campaign to fish as many of the monsters as possible.Ecologists in southern France have recently raised concerns about catfish lurching out of rivers and snatching whole pigeons. Other experts say the invasive catfish are fundamentally altering river ecosystems in western Europe, which is already struggling from the impacts of dams, water pollution, and overfishing.There are fears that warming temperatures and changing rainfall patterns attributed to climate change could create even more favourable conditions for the wels catfish.But the first catfish in western Europe were thought to have been first introduced into Spain’s Ebro River, which runs from Cantabria to Catalonia, along the north of the country.Fishermen in Spain have volunteered to tackle the threat themselves, but find their way blocked by tight government regulations. Under Spain’s environmental laws, anyone who lands a catfish is meant to call the Guardia Civil and wait for them to pick it up.Even so much as transporting the fish, or throwing it back in the water, is considered a crime. Paco, a long-time fisherman who asked for his surname not to be used, says the authorities should encourage anglers to catch as many of the creatures as possible.“If they would let us fish them and kill them, in five years there would be less than 5 per cent left,” he boasts, sitting by the Iznájar reservoir armed with a couple of rods.Currently, however, the large rods and thicker threads that would make catching catfish easier are banned by the government.Antonio Manuel Malagón Serrano, the owner of a fishing store called DMAX Pesca, a 40-minute car ride from Iznájar, complains that the migrant fish are costing him business.“My store is focused on fishing gear to catch other species of fish, like the carp or black bass – but catfish are eating them up, and I can’t sell the material needed to fish these catfish,” he says.But for Mr Fernandez, bringing fishermen on board is not the answer. It was their enjoyment of reeling in the Wels Catfish that brought it to these waters - they cannot be trusted, he says, to truly let go of the catch.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"public wont buy leavers lockdowns bid rewrite history","story":"As far as I can tell, the main qualification for posting a 26-part Twitter thread appears to be the possession of a pair of testicles. Have you noticed how women don’t really “do” threads, presumably because they have more useful things to do than checking how many people have liked the 18th post of 47?Like the edits he made to his blog posts, it’s clear Dominic Cummings’ online outpourings are an attempt to rewrite history ahead of next year’s Covid inquiry. Having taken great offence at originally being described as so pro herd immunity it was “too bad” if old people died, he is now repositioning himself as the love child of Neil Ferguson and Jacinda Ardern.So when Cummings appears before MPs this week as part of their ongoing investigation into the handling of the crisis, we can expect the former Vote Leave campaign director to insist once again he was calling for a lockdown even before Wuhan marketgoers took their first bite of pangolin. Yet as he and his fellow former freedom lover Michael Gove continue to try to dig the earth from underneath Boris Johnson, the ground keeps on coming up to meet the PM. That’s arguably because this new-found cabal of “Leavers for Lockdown”, who suddenly find themselves in favour of state intervention on steroids, have made a series of miscalculations.Firstly, they incorrectly assume that Cummings has any credibility left with the public after arguing that the rules should have been so strict that only he was allowed to break them.Secondly, they wrongly believe that the public only care about the Covid lives saved, when the focus is swiftly turning to non-coronavirus deaths.Thirdly, they are under the misapprehension that the public inquiry will conclude anything beyond: “It was six of one and half a dozen of the other,” and “lessons must be learned.”By that point, with a clearer picture of just how many people have a) died of cancer b) lost their livelihoods and c) failed their exams, the pro-lockdown fanatics may start looking a little less “sage”. With the public not quite knowing whether he is a libertarian, lockdowner or both, it doesn’t require a Twitter thread to explain how Mr Johnson’s ambiguity may once again prove to be his salvation.With the re-opening of pubs, restaurants and cafes, indoor mask wearing has been rendered ridiculous.It simply doesn’t make any scientific sense to be able to sit at a table without a mask but have to wear one while walking to the toilet.I had a similarly silly experience in a bakery last week (where I may or may not have been buying a large sausage roll and a slice of Battenberg, Henry VIII style).Half the people inside weren’t covering their faces, simply by dint of being sat on a chair, while the other half were muzzled. I couldn’t feel more for the poor staff. There is a time and place for a face mask and it is certainly not while taking crusty loaves out of a raging hot oven.Since non-surgical face masks have been proved by countless studies to be virtually useless, and nearly 60 million covid vaccinations have now been given – why on earth are we still wearing them?As someone who regularly Googles herself (largely to search for my own articles and to check the nude photos still haven’t surfaced), I was astonished to discover that, as of last week, I have a Wikipedia entry.There is something a bit weird about someone I don’t know taking the time to research and write my online biography, complete with references. On the plus side, there are no obvious howlers, even if the copy does lack a little sensitivity at times.“Tominey’s mother, an alcoholic housewife, died in 2001,” declares the opening paragraph under “Early life”. While accurate, my dear departed Ma would certainly have objected to being described as a “housewife”.There is also something slightly sinister about the concluding line: “She is a teetotaller”, which perhaps doesn’t quite take into account my fondness for chugging Appletiser.

And the blockbuster showdown could not come at a more exciting time. The next week will also see the first ‘cash for curtains’ review into Boris Johnson’s flat refurbishment publish its findings - a row No sources suggested had been sparked by leaks from Mr Cummings. Meanwhile, the register of ministerial interests is finally due to be updated - and the PM has promised to give an update on plans for lockdown easing - both of which are subjects Mr Cummings is liable to talk about in his grilling. It’s likely to be so explosive, in fact, that rumours have spread through Westminster that the PM was planning to hold a reshuffle the same day to distract attention from the session - a notion played down by No today.Here’s some of the explosive questions that are likely to come up as Dominic Cummings gives evidence to the joint Science and Health committee hearing on Wednesday. Although other subjects are likely to come up, Mr Cummings is nominally appearing before the committee to talk about the government’s response to the Covid pandemic. It’s a subject on which he’s been openly critical of the government in the months since his departure from Number  - and the more relations with his old allies have broken down, the more critical he’s been. He’s likely to talk about the PM’s reluctance to impose a second lockdown. In frustration, Mr Johnson is reported to have told aides he’d rather see “bodies pile up in the streets” than impose a second wave of restrictions - and critics have said the lockdown that started in January could have been avoidedtougher restrictions had been brought in in November. . What about the first lockdown  Mr Cummings thoughts on the first lockdown appear to have…evolved over time. Many will know him best as the man who broke lockdown rules to take his family to Durham - while potentially infected with Covid- -at the height of the first lockdown. But in a recent tweet, Mr Cummings said: “Many thousands will have serious health problems for years because of our failure to act faster harder in Feb March  Sep”  Border restrictions are almost certain to come under the microscope during the session - after Mr Cummings described the UK’s policy as a “joke”. In a tweet he said there was a problem “based on nonsense memes” which claimed that people in Asian countries, “all do as they’re told… it won’t work here” - something he said “behavioural science ‘experts’ charlatans argued, disastrously, in Feb .” He added: “This nonsense is STILL influencing policy, eg our joke borders policy.” . What are those documents you have there, Dom   Mr Cummings has suggested he has some explosive documents which could lay bare Mr Johnson’s decision making during the crisis. He said there was one document in particular that he had the only copy of - and was “crucial”. And ministers fear he could use parliamentary privilege to release documents which may not paint the Government in a particularly good light into the public domain. In one of his many tweets, Mr Cummings argued “one of the most fundamental  unarguable lessons” of the early days of the pandemic was that “secrecy contributed greatly to the catastrophe”. “Openness to scrutiny [would] have exposederrors weeks earlier than happened,” he said. And in a blog post he suggested he was “open” to handing over documents - including all of the emails he sent and received during that period - to the Committee. . Who paid for the Downing Street flat refurbishment   Fair warning - this might not actually get asked. But that doesn’t mean Mr Cummings won’t talk about it. Last month, Mr Cummings made explosive claims about Boris Johnson and Carrie Symonds’ lavish redecoration of their grace-and-favour flat. It’s reported the skint Prime Minister, fresh from a orce, looked to fund the works through a Tory political donation - something he failed to deny when quizzed today. Mr Cummings denied responsibility for the leaks - but said: “The PM stopped speaking to me about this matter in  as I told him I thought his plans to have donors secretly pay for the renovation were unethical, foolish, possibly illegal. “And [they] almost certainly broke the rules on proper disclosure of political donationsconducted in the way he intended.” Downing Street has repeatedly said that the PM “covered the cost” of the refurbishment personally - but it’s still unclear who paid for it to begin with.FOLLOW USMirrorPoliticsFollow @MirrorPoliticsCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnCoronavirusDominic Cummings"},{"url":null,"title":"dominic cummings asked prove didnt","story":"NewsDominic Cummings may be asked to prove he didn’t go on second lockdown tripEXCLUSIVE: Boris Johnson’s former chief adviser has always denied ing north a second time a week after his -mile journey from London to Durham while the UK was in a strict first lockdownmirrorShareCommentsByJeremy ArmstrongPippa CrerarDaily Mirror Political Editor:,  MAY NewsDominic Cummings may face a new quiz \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get US and UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Boris Johnson ’s former chief adviser came under fire for driving  miles from his London home just weeks into the strict first lockdown, when he was seen in Barnard Castle on April  last year.He has always denied ing north again the following week, but now there are calls for him to provide the evidence. He is due before the Health and Social Care Committee and Science and Technology Committee on Wednesday to give evidence on the Government’s handling of the pandemic. What is your view  Have your say in the comment section  He is threatening to release a “crucial historical document” about the Prime Minister’s response, blaming Government secrecy for last year’s “catastrophe”. But his call for transparency could backfire as questions continue over the allegations of a second Durham trip, highlighted by a joint Mirror  investigation a year ago today. David and Clare Edwards, both , told police they saw Mr Cummings in Houghall Woods, Durham, just after am on April  last year.  He has consistently denied their version of events. Three other witnesses have since claimed they also saw him. In their response to a complaint by David and Clare over the handling of the case, Durham Police quoted a report that Mr Cummings was seen on Hampstead Heath in London on April . New Durham Police and Crime Commissioner Joy Allen has since said she would support examination of automatic number plate recognition footage near the woods for the time concerned.  David said: “I think it is a very good idea to ask Mr Cummings to provide evidence of where he was on April . Someone should ask him that question.” Former Durham Police chief constable Mike Barton said Mr Cummings had “risked lives” by driving across the country when his we was showing signs of infection.

Bashir’s deceitful and unethical behaviour was an abuse of his position and a clear breach of the high journalistic standards on which his former employer prides itself. The BBC then added to the disgrace by failing to investigate properly the underhand tactics used to land the  interview. The whole sorry affair has caused understandable anguish for the late Princess’s family and friends. Earl Spencer has claimed there is a link between the programme and his sister’s death two years later.  The BBC has rightly apologised but its expressions of remorse will count for nothing unless it ensures that such a situation can never happen again. Bashir’s reputation rightly lies in tatters but his personal ignominy should not be allowed to tarnish the whole corporation, which still strives to deliver impartial journalism. Buck passers The Government has set aside £billion for the Covid test and trace system. Despite the eye-watering amount lavished, the programme is still not working properly.  We now learn that technical glitches were partly responsible for the spread of the Indian iant, with councils unable to respond to the outbreak because they could not access the data on positive tests in their area. Yet earlier this week, Health Secretary Matt Hancock implied it was the failure of people to get vaccinated that was behind the surge. This now comes across as an attempt to sht the blame for the Government’s own failings. Instead of trying to pass the buck, ministers should start taking some responsibility.

But Brits are convinced Eurovision is an opportunity for things to get political - with seven in  adults sure other countries deliberately give the UK a low score, regardless of how good they are.  And a further three quarters think many countries vote for their neighbours to do well as part of their apostacticalapos voting. Four in  adults would like the whole contest rebranded to The Worldvision Song Contest, opening the competition up to artists from every nation. The study conducted via OnePoll found  per cent of adults watch Eurovision every single year - with one fth even attending a party for the event. However not everyone is bothered,  per cent of people never vote, and a further one in  have never ever tuned in.  The spokesman for Lottoland added: There is an element of tackiness about Eurovision that we either love or we hate, but between the outfits, the Europop music, and the likes of Graham Norton getting involved itaposs hard to tear your eyes away.

Updated:,  MAY AdvertorialFamilies across England are reuniting as lockdown restrictions ease and indoor hospitality is once again open, including cinemas, pubs and concert venues. It’s the first time since  that people from dferent households have been allowed to meet indoors. Now, they can mix inside in groups of six – or two households – and celebrations such as weddings and christenings in Covid-secure settings are permitted, with up to  people. But the virus is still out there with one in three people showing no symptoms, so regular rapid testing and following the Hands, Face, Space, Fresh Air guidance will help us all stay safe and stop the spread. Meeting outdoors is always the safest option, andyou do go indoors stick to the rule of six or two households. Here’s what you need to know to follow the rules and stay safe... I can’t wait to hug my parents. Is that permitted now   Yes, you can now have close contact with family and friends – including hugs. Use caution and common sense and think about the risk of catching or passing on the virus, which spreads mainly among people who are in close contact . I’d love a minibreak. Can I stay overnight with friends now  Yes. Hotels, BBs and hostels are now open, so overnight stays are permitted for groups of up to six, or two households. I’m sick of doing yoga on Zoom – can I go to a class in person   Yes, organised exercise classes, including those in gyms or yoga and Pilates can resume in a Covid-safe environment.

Residents can now leave the home for a low-risk visit, such as a walk in the park, without then having to self-isolate for  days. I’m still unsure about mixing indoors. How can I stay safe  Go at your own pace and follow the rules. It’s safer to meet outsideyou can – and minimise close contact. If you do choose to meet indoors, open a window to ventilate and let fresh air in. Remember, some people are more vulnerable than others and exercise caution at all times. One in three people who have Covid- shows no symptoms, so get into a routine of taking two tests a week and isolatethe result is positive.

They hit the jackpot after their postcode,NP LG, in the Welsh town of New Tredegar, was drawn as a big winner.And theyaposre already planning a bumper street party to celebrate the le-changing news. Among the winners are an NHS nurse, a set of relations and a winner who recently suffered heartbreak at the hands of covid. Support worker Gareth Walbeoff, , lost his father to the pandemic in January. He said: My poor mum was having to isolate for  days, so only I could go to console her, none of the other family could go. “Then she unfortunately fell and broke her back, she’s up and about now and my niece is taking her to a hospital appointment today. My niece is really good to mum, I couldn’t manage without her. She’s got three children and my nephew has a little girl as well. What I’m going to do is pay for all these kids to have a good holiday in a big -star, luxury caravan in Tenby for two weeks!  He also congratulated his neighbours and added: “In this street we all are like one big family. When it’s safe to do so we’re going to have one hell of a street party!”Gareth wasn’t the only member of his family to get a call from lottery ambassador Danyl Johnson . One of the other winners was -year-old Alan Vaughan whose partner, Nicola, is Gareth’s cousin.Another winner from the street was NHS nurse Tina Watkinswho learned of her windfall while on a break at work. As the cheque was revealed, the -year-old clapped with joy and said: “Woo!  grand! Oh that’s fantastic, thank you very much!” Her co-workers cheered on hearing the total and Tina said she would buy her manager, who was holding Tina’s camera phone over the call, ‘a nice big cake.’ Tina already had plans for some of her winnings: She added: “I’ve got a house renovation going on, so I can plough it into that and buy my son a car. What a lovely surprise, I can finish off what I want to do with the house without having to save. “Maybe a holiday next year. Our holiday to Fuerteventura was cancelled this year, but we might go further afield now.” People’s Postcode Lottery ambassador Danyl Johnson sent his congratulations to all the winners. He said: “What a fantastic surprise for our winners in New Tredegar! I can tell it is a really close community, so I was thrilled to bring this great news. “Congratulations to them and all our other winners today, I’m sure they’ll enjoy their winnings.” Everyday throughout the April draws one postcode was announced as a £, prize winner. All the players in the postcode won £, for every ticket they hold. People’s Postcode Lottery costs £ a month to play and there are guaranteed winners every day.

According to water firm United Utilities, the disgusting mass of waste, wet wipes and other sanitary items discovered in Liverpool had to be removed as it was causing homes to flood. So the firmaposs engineers came up with an ingenious method which essentially eats the fatberg from the inside out. The strategy saw workers push a steel rope through the m fatberg and cut it with a jet. Programme delivery manager Sammy Nelson said: It was done with great success and within a couple of weeks, flow was restored to the sewer.What are your thoughts on this  Let us know in the comments section below. The fatberg, which had been causing issues on Bankhall Lane, Birchall Street and Foster Street, was removed in half the time it would have taken to replace the sewer. It is one of a string of vile masses discovered across the country this year. In February the Mirror reported how gruesome pictures of fatbergs and other drain blockages in Hull prompted a warning about responsible flushing.The images, shared by the team of workers tasked with clearing the horric waste, showed the dramatic consequences of wet wipes, sanitary products and cotton buds being flushed down toilets, as well as fats, oils and greases being poured down drains.  That came just before a huge, disgusting fatberg the weight of a small bungalow was removed from a sewer in London. Members of the public had at the time been urged to be careful what they flush following the two-week removal operation for the foul-smelling mass from a conduit in Canary Wharf, London.While  tonnes of unflushable waste, equivalent to two massive blue whales, were cleared from  miles of sewer pipes underneath Southend-on-Sea in Essex last month.

Sarah Clarke, , is the ex of two men serving le for murder - her eight-year-old sonaposs dad and stepdad.Her childaposs father, Damian aposScarfaceapos Gorman, was jailed for a pub assassination with notorious cop killer Dale Cregan, the Liverpool Echo reports.Her sonaposs stepdad, Stephen Strutt, was one of four killers who murdered dad-of-one Warren Glover. Clarke told police deliberate lies about his whereabouts, later hiding him in a Blackpool hotel room, booked using her auntaposs bank card. Clarke sobbed as her lawyer today made a plea for mercy at Liverpool Crown Court. He said this was for her son, for whom she is the sole carer.  But Judge Denis Watson, QC, said her case was yet another example of how a criminalaposs actions impact on not only the lives of their victims, but their own family as well.CCTV footage showed Strutt, , stopping to buy beer when he travelled from Manchester to Merseyside with a gang to hunt down Mr Glover on Saturday, June  last year.Judge Watson said the victim was killed out of vengeance, after sending offensive and provocative texts to his ex-girlfriend Melissa Stubbs, , her parents and friends.The NHS worker was attacked by Melissaaposs brother Aaron Stubbs, , in residential French Street, at around .pm.Aaron and Melissa earlier threatened they were coming to smack his head in and their mum Gail Duff had texted the victim: Prepare to meet your maker. Mr Glover came out with a lump hammer and damaged the Stubbsapos car, before running away, but Aaron struck him over the head from behind with an iron bar.  Strutt had recruited his brother-in-law, Peter Walker, , to join the attack, who chased Mr Glover with a baseball bat. Mr Glover was found unconscious in the street and died in hospital on July .Aaron, Melissa, Strutt and Walker were all found guilty of murder after a trial, when Clarke was convicted of assisting an offender.Strutt, who had a child of his own, lived with Clarke in Stalybridge, but she claimed she had no idea he was wanted for murder. Judge Watson said when Struttaposs family home was searched by police on July , Clarke texted her sister details from the search documents. On July , she sent a text to Strutt saying donapost get caught with him, which Judge Watson said was a reference to Aaron Stubbs, then still at large.  He told Clarke from at least July  and likely earlier, you knew perfectly well that the police were wanting to speak to your partner and from that date onwards at the very latest you knew he was wanted for questioning in relation to a murder investigation. The judge said she searched online about who was going to be charged and knew from seeing Struttaposs photo that he was wanted, but all the while you provided shelter and advice for him. Judge Watson told her that was serious enough, but you then actively misled the police to his whereabouts, telling them that he not been seen by you for several days and that he was working away. The judge, who branded these deliberate lies, said the next day the couple travelled to Garstang, where she persuaded relatives to let her use their bank cards to book a hotel in a dferent name in Blackpool. The court heard they stayed overnight there, but police by then had tracked down and arrested Strutt. Andy Scott, defending, said character references from family and friends spoke in the most positive and glowing terms of Ms Clarke, her qualities as a mother and as a friend.  He said: Sarah Clarke of course is anxious over her fate. However, she acknowledges that her anxiety, her distress, is nothing compared with the grief and trauma of the family and friends of Warren Glover. Pleading for mercy, he said she had a realistic prospect of rehabilitation, strong personal mitigation and jailing her would have a signicant harmful impact on her child. He said Clarke was considered a low risk of reconviction and a medium risk of causing danger to the public, and her only past conviction was for motoring offences last year. Mr Scott suggested her crime didnapost extensively impede justice and when hiding Strutt in Blackpool, it was inevitable she would have ed home, because of her son. Judge Watson interjected: She might have done. Mr Scott said Strutt was arrested within hours of them going to the hotel and asked the judge to balance that with texts she sent him asking himself to hand himself in. Clarke cried in the dock as Mr Scott added: She is of course a sole carer for her son, Of course we know that Mr Strutt was the stepfather. He had been taken away. Ms Clarke has ended that relationship with Mr Strutt.  He said Clarke feared her relationship with her son would be irreparably damaged and the rupture to it enormous, adding thatshe was jailed, it would be devastating. Mr Scott said: She will lose her liberty. She will also lose her home. He said the eight-year-old boy had dficulties of his own, outlined at a recent Child in Need meeting, but he would not delve into further personal matters in a report. Mr Scott said: To say Ms Clarke has been unlucky in love is an understatement. Once again, ultimately she will have to pick up the fragments of a fractured relationship. She takes the blame heavily on her own shoulders. That again primarily is because of the harm and the hurt she will have caused her son. The judge said he had bore the impact on her son in mind, but her crime was a real, albeit short lived impediment to an arrest police had tried to make for weeks. Judge Watson, who said the signicant mitigation had resulted in a shorter sentence, jailed Clarke for  months. One of Clarkeaposs supporters - a man sitting in the public gallery - stood up and shouted you will be alright as she was sent down, while a sobbing woman rushed towards the dock and said: Can we see her  Judge Watson said: You wonapost be able to see her - thank you very much for coming. The man moaned smug face on him as he stormed out of court. Jailing Strutt for le with a minimum of  years, Judge Watson previously said: You knew you were wanted by the police and you were trying to lie low in Blackpool to avoid arrest. Aaron Stubbs, of Lane End Road, Burnage, was jailed for le with a minimum of  and a half years. Melissa Stubbs, of the same address as her brother, was jailed for le with a minimum of  and a half years. Walker, of Garth Road, Wythenshawe, was jailed for le with a minimum of  and a half years. Clarkeaposs ex-boyfriend Gorman was convicted of the murder of gangland rival Mark Short, and the attempted murder of three other men, at an east Manchester pub. Clarkeaposs relationship with Gorman led to her facing a charge of intimidating a witness and giving evidence at his and Creganaposs murder trial in . Preston Crown Court heard Clarke and Gorman lived together for three years and she had his son in September . The then -year-old told the trial she had been charged with intimidating a female witness, who had given evidence against Gorman, then . She denied intimidating the woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, in a park following the midnight shooting of Mark Short in May . That witness described how intimidating cocaine dealer Gorman, who she said was known as Scarface, had threatened her thatshe went to the police, the one-eyed Scotchman - Cregan - would kill her. The prosecution alleged the two assassins Cregan and Gorman went to clean up at Clarkeaposs home after killing Mark Short and pointed to Gormanaposs clothing, found outside the property in bin bags, as evidence of this. However, Clarke told jurors she had dumped Gormanaposs clothes outside the house they rented in Hollingworth, Tameside, when she moved out because Gorman had been jailed for  weeks over a previous matter. Cregan, who admitted murdering both Mark Short and his dad David Short during the trial, having earlier admitted murdering police officers Nicola Hughes and Fiona Bone, was handed a whole le sentence. He will never be freed and is now locked up at maximum security Ashworth Hospital in Maghull. Gorman was found guilty of the murder of Mark Short and the attempted murder of three other men. He was jailed for le with a minimum of  years behind bars in June . Clarke was cleared of any wrongdoing in that case, when prosecutors dropped the allegation of intimidating a witness against her in August .FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorMore OnNHSCCTVHospitalsCCTV footageCourt caseCrown courtLe sentenceMurder trialPrison sentenceCrime"},{"url":null,"title":"mum left looking like elephant","story":"NewsMum left looking like elephant man finds miracle cure to swelling on AmazonJade Mcguiness,  and from Liverpool, said being diagnosed with lymphoedema was \"even more devastating\" than being told she had cancer but claims Amazon has given her a remedymirrorShareCommentsByEllen Kirwin:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY NewsJade Mcguiness, from Liverpool, suffers from lymphoedema \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

The said the diagnosis came after radiotherapy and surgery to remove a cancerous tumour from her saliva gland. She had then been diagnosed with adenoid cystic carcinoma after finding a lump in her neck that caused her agony.That was thankfully removed with success and Jade was thrilled to finally be relieved of the pain, the Liverpool Echo reports. But she was then shocked when it led to a diagnosis which she said was even more devastating than cancer.Jade told the Echo : I was made up after the surgery, I bought the doctor a bevvy and chocolates because I’d not touched a pain killer since the operation , I was amazed.Jade continued with her radiotherapy, which she described as awful, but said the real shock came after a visit to the dentist.  She said: I went the dentist and she said ‘what is that ’ She said she was booking me an emergency referral because she wasn’t happy with the swelling. So I went in and the doctor said heaposs happy with how my treatment is going but the swelling is caused by lymphedema. I was in shock. The mum-of-two described the lymphoedema diagnosis as being more devastating than finding out she had cancer and like she’d been given a le sentence. The -year-old added: The doctor said the swelling was caused by the trauma to the neck from radiotherapy and my surgery. That knocked me sick because he said there was nothing I could do to reduce the swelling, just some massages. Iaposve always struggled with the way I look and getting told that was a massive hit, it killed me off.  I had finally gotten over the cancer trauma but then I thought I’m stuck looking like this forever. I’ll get rid of the cancer, I am going to beat that, but I got told this lump was for le, itaposs like being given a le sentence. According to the NHS there is no cure for lymphoedema. On its website the NHS adds: Itaposs usually possible to control the main symptoms using techniques to minimise fluid build-up and stimulate the flow of fluid through the lymphatic system. These include wearing compression garments, taking good care of your skin, moving and exercising regularly, having a healthy diet and lestyle, and using specialised massage techniques. Jade said she started looking into home remedies after being unsatisfied with doctors advice. She ordered a neck strap from Amazon and her friend gave her some aposthermogenesis gelapos and claims she started to see results within an hour. Jade said that the miracle discovery has saved her le and that she now wants others with lymphedema to know about the options available. She said: I wrapped my face up for an hour. Iaposd already taken a photo of my face before the strap and gel and I sat and I waited praying for a miracle, then I removed the strap and here are the results. I am over the moon. I now donapost wake up with a puffy face. I wear my strap for an hour a day and it saves my le. Jade added: I thought how many other people are living like me depressed to death because I even joined the gym and everything thinking Iaposd put weight on, but evenI did lose weight Iaposd still look like the elephant man and have a fat face. Iaposm not about to take things sitting down and I know there are a lot of people like me.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnNHSAmazon"},{"url":null,"title":"return big weddings june 21","story":"NewsReturn of big weddings from June  to get go-ahead next week in joy for couplesBoris Johnson is expected to say that wedding limits will be removed as part of the final step in his roadmap out of restrictions.

On Friday, Mr Johnson gave yet another signal that the June  freedom day, when social distancing rules and other Covid laws are set to be scrapped, will go ahead. This is despite the surge in cases related to the Indian Covid iant, with the ONS reporting the first signs that the virus is on the rise again in the UK. The prime minister said he would give the public an update “by the end of the month” on results of the review into relaxing social distancing rules. “I am still seeing nothing in the data that leads me to think that we’re going to have to deviate from the roadmap,” he said, signalling his confidence that the Indian iant will not derail his plans. Do you have wedding plans hanging in the balance  Email webnews@mirror  And the Dailyreports government sources as saying they were confident that large-scale weddings would be allowed, as long as the data on the Indian iant did not get out of hand They said confidence about the safety of weddings involving more than  people had grown following test events - where just  people tested positive for Covid- out of , attendees. A Whitehall source told the paper: “There’s increasing confidence that vaccines are working against all iants, and the data doesn’t seem to be changing too drastically in terms of case numbers and hospitalisations. As long as there are no signicant changes over the next few days, there is cautious optimism.”  The government is set to give a formal update on the Indian iant next week. The results of two reviews will then follow: one into the future of social distancing, the other about the viability of a Covid certication scheme. Johnson has played down the prospect of vaccine passports or negative test certicates being widely used. “I don’t see any prospect of certicates to go into pubs or anything ,” he said. Pressed on the outcome of the social distancing review, he said: “We will let people know as much as we possibly can by the end of the month about weddings, for instance.” It is a striking change of tone a week after Johnson warned the Indian iant could “seriously disrupt” the roadmap. There are early signs of a potential rise in the proportion of people testing positive for coronavirus in England, new figures show.Office for National Statisticsfigures, published on Friday, show that around one in , people in private households in England had Covid- in the week to May  - up from one in , the previous week. The coronavirus reproduction number, or R value, in England has also risen slightly to between . to ., up from between . and  last week, according to the latest Government figures.  It comes after the latest official figures showed that cases of the Indian iant of coronavirus in the UK have risen by more than , in the space of a week. But while the ONS said that there were early signs of a potential increase, it stressed that rates were low and it was too soon to saythe rise was the start of a trend. Mr Johnson said on Friday: We will be letting everybody know exactly what sort of arrangements to expect for June .  I am still seeing nothing in the data that leads me to think that weaposre going to have to deviate from the road map - obviously we must remain cautious but Iaposm seeing nothing that makes me think we have to deviate. But on June  and vaccine certication - or Covid status certication I should say - people should bear in mind that I donapost see any prospect of certicates to go into pubs or anything . Pressed on whether the public will continue to be asked to wear masks, Mr Johnson replied: All the details weaposll try and let people know by the end of the month about exactly where we think weaposll be on June , Step .FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnBoris JohnsonMarriageWeddingsCoronavirus"},{"url":null,"title":"teen left partially blind after","story":"NewsTeen left partially blind after phone charger explodes and spark flies into her eyeBirmingham University Law student Esther Modede, , was left partially blind in her left eye after a damaged phone charger exploded and sparks damaged her eyemirrorShareCommentsByAlyce Collins:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video teen-left-blinded-after-phone-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:vTYAxfD,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

Law student Esther Modede, , from Birmingham, West Midlands, was plugging her phone in on the evening of April  when she noticed the wire looked a little damaged. Shortly after, Esther’s phone and the charger started burning up and she noticed smoke. Moments later the wire began exploding and one of the sparks hit Esther directly in the eye, leaving her unable to see out of her left eye. That night Esther spent four hours in hospital getting a bandage over her eye, which she had to keep on for three days. When the bandage was removed, Esther’s eyesight still wasn’t back to normal but she is slowly recovering.  Esther said: “I had borrowed my friends my charger over the weekend and when I got it back it was slightly damaged. “I didn’t think anything of it so I plugged in my phone to charge and it started burning up. “I didn’t think it was going to get any worse and then as I was recording it, it started sparking.  “I then got a spark in my eye and I couldn’t see very well at all. I didn’t realise I was that close or that the spark would be able to enter my eye. I was extremely worried. “Everything went blurry and when I closed my other eye I couldn’t see very well. “I had the bandage on my eye for three days. When I took the bandage off I couldn’t see very clearly, but my sight has cleared up and is still healing.” Esther was told by eye specialists at Birmingham City Hospital that the spark had damaged her cornea. She added: The surface of my eye was effected. The moment the spark hit my eye my eye shut and I felt it begin to swell. It was a hot sensation. The swelling and the blurring of my sight was worrying. My vision as of last week was still recovering but as of [now], currently, it’s a lot better and I can now read when the other eye is shut.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnEducationHospitalsStudents"},{"url":null,"title":"uk weather bitterly cold 3c","story":"NewsUK weather: Bitterly cold C weekend brings more rain with wettest May on record on cardsAfter a miserable May that threatens to be the wettest ever recorded, Brits are set to endure more torrential downpours and regular showers over a chilly weekendmirrorShareCommentsByJeremy CulleyAssistant Editor:,  MAY NewsMay is set to be the wettest on record \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

The fierce winds and rain that have blighted the week may ease slightly but temperatures are set to remain unseasonably cool. And there will still be frequent heavy showers throughout the country with more persistent rain for some.The weather is not set to substantially improve until the Bank Holiday weekend, when the mercury clambers back up to a more normal May temperature.This month could end up being the UKaposs wettest May on record for some areas, with % of the monthaposs average rainfall having already fallen only  days in. Heavy rain in the South West, which could see new rainfall records set for May in Devon and Wales, will be replaced by lighter, patchier showers on Saturday with longer dry spells. The Met Office has predicted some respite and from heavy downpours and gale-force winds on Saturday, with brief spells of sunshine, though temperatures are still set to be low for the time of year.Daytime temperatures are predicted to be in the mid-single figures for much of the UK, dropping to as low as C in northern England and Scotland on Saturday night. This will be the first weekend that people in England have been able to meet in larger groups outside, and outdoor events resumed. Some northern regions in Scotland could also see frost on Saturday and Sunday morning.  Forecasters have said northern Scotland and Northern Ireland are likely to see the best of the sunshine on Sunday. Met Office meteorologist Annie Shuttleworth said more settled springtime weather is predicted for the following week. She added: Weaposre pointing towards seeing things settling down from the middle of next week onwards, particularly in the south. There is a good deal of uncertainty in the forecast, but weaposre hoping by the end of May we will have much drier and settled weather across the UK. She said the long-term forecast suggests June will be much drier than May. The most likely scenario at the moment is looking like predominantly dry weather, at quite a contrast to what weaposve seen with the wet weather in May, so that would be an improvement, she added. Last year, the UK experienced its sunniest spring and driest May since records began, with  hours of bright sunshine recorded, beating the previous high of  hours, set in . Today Sunny spells and scattered showers for Scotland and Northern Ireland. England and Wales starting rather cloudy but brightening up from the west later. Also a few showers, mainly in the west this morning and east later. Less windy than yesterday. Tonight Early evening showers becoming confined to Irish Sea coastal counties and southwest England and a chilly end to the day. Clear spells overnight, but rain into Northern Ireland by dawn. Sunday Early cloud and rain, heavy at times, over Northern Ireland spreading eastwards reaching all but the far north and east by evening. Showers following into the west. Turning windy. Outlook for Monday to Wednesday An unsettled, cool start to the week with showers or longer spells of rain, heavy in places. Starting to turn drier and a little warmer from the west during midweek.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnMet OfficeWeather"},{"url":null,"title":"uk weather could wettest record","story":"NewsUK weather: May could be wettest on record with weekend to see yet more torrential rainWith nine days still to go, Wales has seen almost double the average levels of rainfall for the entire month.

Thataposs exactly what has happened to one woman, when she found herself on the verge of tears in the middle of a park, after making a worrying discovery. Jo Remedios, from New Ferry in Merseyside, was out walking her dog when she suddenly realised she had lost her house keys, and to make matters worse, the only spare key was with her husband, who was down in London.I started panicking and knocked at my neighbours. They had a ladder but I still needed the keys to open the door even from the inside, the -year-old explained to the Liverpool Echo. I thought Iaposll retrace my steps went back but I was hysterical. My partner is in London and heaposs the only one with another key and he was thinking heaposd have to drive home. Mid-panic and with no clue what  to do, Jo stopped three young boys who were riding through the park on bikes, and asked themtheyaposd be willing to help. I was like a mad woman all upset and these boys were going past on their bikes. I said, aposcan you please help me apos And they threw their bikes down and came over straight away, she added. I was just panicking thinking what am I going to do - I was nearly crying! They must have thought I was a mad woman in the park.  After around  minutes of searching, the boys, James Grant, nine, and brothers Oliver Langan  and Louis Langan, eight, managed to track down the missing keys lying in the grass and Joaposs nightmare came to an end.I was so relieved, so I said can I take your picture for Facebook  They said why and I said because youaposre amazing and youaposve helped me, she said, adding that she went straight home and posted a thank you message on social media.Jo posted the picture on Facebook, writing: Whosever parents these boys are they are a credit to you. I lost my keys whilst I let my dog have a run on the New Ferry park they threw their bikes down when they seen I was hysterical thinking I was locked out and stuck!!!!! Thank you so much, you lovely kind boys. The post was quickly inundated with comments praising the boys, and it was even spotted by their parents, who described their sons as true gentlemen and just lovely boys. It puts your faith back in people. They were just dead helpful, they were polite. They didnapost have to do what they did, they could have carried on going to the park. They were just lovely, absolutely lovely kids, Jo added. You hear so many bad things about kids I just thought they deserved the recognition. I just donapost know what I would have donethey hadnapost have been there to help me look. I was so lucky.Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

Your information will be used in accordance with ourPrivacy Notice.Thank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeWith his neck brutally pinned to the ground minutes from death, George Floyd locked eyes with Charles McMillian as he fought to speak his last few words. As others angrily focused on murderous police officer Derek Chauvin, the -year-old concentrated on the man whose le was ebbing away before him. “I just knew he was killing him,” said McMillian. “You could see it in George’s face. I could not help, as a black man in America and someone who has been arrested like he was, but think to myself that it could so easily have been me.” McMillian was speaking before the first anniversary of Floyd’s murder on Tuesday.His emotionally charged, powerful testimony paved the way for Chauvin’s murder conviction last month.  The father of eight wants to see the killer officer put away for le when he is sentenced on June . “He should get le,” he said. “They give us [black men] le, he should get le too. “I have no hard feelings towards Chauvin. I don’t want to give way to hate all I want to ask him is ‘Why ’” Fate brought McMillian and Chauvin together at the corner of th and Chicago Avenue in the tough southern district of Minneapolis on May  last year.  Five days earlier, the car wash worker had pulled level with the officer’s SUV at a red light. Looking across, he told Chauvin: “At the end of the day, go home to your family safe.” The policeman, , acknowledged his kindness before the light changed green, and the two went their separate ways. On the day of Floyd’s death, McMillian saw a police cruiser in his “hood” and stopped to see what was going on.  “Any other time, I might have just kept driving,” he explained. “We see this kind of thing every day in my hood. “I don’t know what made me stop this time. I was being nosy. Something told me something wasn’t right.” As he got out of his car, he became the first civilian on the scene of a crime that changed the world. He recalled: “The officer was trying to get him in the car and everything, talking to him.  I was telling him just to comply, get in the car because you can’t win. I’ve been where George was that day.” “I am not trying to win,” responded an increasingly distressed Floyd, who struggled with the police as they tried to get him into a police car. Repeatedly he told them he was “claustrophobic” and had anxiety. In now-famous videos, witnesses implore Chauvin to let Floyd, , breathe.  Yet McMillian, captured on police body cams wearing distinctive white framed glasses, a black T-shirt, beige shorts and white flip-flops, is the only one directly interacting with Floyd. “I kept my eyes focused only on George,” said McMillian, who can be heard pleading “Get up.” “I will. I can’t move,” Floyd responds. McMillian said: “It was then George began beginning for his mom. ‘Mama. Mama. Mama,’ he was crying out.  It really brought home how much he was struggling to live. I’d lost my mom a year before, and the pain was still raw in me. I understood him. “Chauvin didn’t care though. He seemed high on the power he had. “I said to him, ‘the man said he couldn’t breathe.’ They said, ‘ he keeps talking, well, he can breathe.’” After nine minutes and  seconds, Chauvin finally removed his weight as an ambulance arrived.  The attending paramedic said he was dead. After the body is removed, McMillian confronts Chauvin. Reminding him of their previous encounter, he tells him he “does not respect” what he just did and calls him a “maggot”. Today, McMillian says he hopes racism in America will be defeated but is fearful Floyd’s death will be in vain.  He said: “Being black in America is a disadvantaged way of le. George died for the colour of his skin, not from the crime they accused him of committing.” McMillian grew up picking cotton alongside his mother, Queen, on a farm in Mississippi. He moved from Aberdeen to Minnesota when he was . He bounced from one unskilled job to another and suffered from alcohol and drug addiction, but has been sober since .

As we spoke with McMillian and his son, Charlie, , gunfire broke out  yards away between gang members. McMillian said: “Everything goes on in my hood. There is no dference today than before George was killed. It’s as dangerous now as it was then.” Though he is not hopeful for America, McMillian hopes people in the UK will continue to fight racial inequality. He said: “If anything good has come from George’s murder it’s that people are ready to be heard.” He has not been contacted by Floyd’s family or lawyers, but said: “It would be nice to meet them one day. I was the last brother George spoke to.”Charles McMillianaposs son has set up an online fundraiser for his dad to visit his mumaposs grave. You can help him here.

Max Anderson was the man to drop to the bench.Marshall, meanwhile, was only fit enough for a place on the bench after five weeks out. He was joined by striker Jason Cummings as a substitute with Danny Mullen leading the line.The dangermen started for the Premiership side with Chris Burke looking to provide service for striker Kyle Lafferty.A huge roar erupted from the  home fans as Dundee kicked off, shooting towards the empty Bob Shankly Stand in the first half.The rain was teaming down with a chill wind but there was no dampening of voices at the other end.They were up again seconds into the contest as Shaun Byrne crunched into Greg Kiltie in midfield.The real roar came on six minutes, though, as Dundee got off to the perfect start.And it was that man McGhee with another key play-off goal.Charlie Adam found time in the middle to chip perfectly over the defence for the run of Cammy Kerr.With his left-foot the full-back sent the ball in first time to find the head of Mullen.Colin Doyle got to it but could only push the ball onto the post. Following in was McGhee, however, and he got his reward with a tap-in on the line.And it could easily have been - inside  minutes as Paul McMullan found himself through on goal.He took his time but couldn#t beat Doyle from the angle.On the quarter-hour mark Killie threatened for the first time as Lafferty ran the channel in behind Fontaine before curling an effort well wide.As the conditions worsened, the visitors began to work the ball and work the Dundee defence.They weren#t getting much change out of the Dark Blues players charged up by the boisterous  in the stand, though.The contest meandered towards half-time with neither side able to create much on the slippy pitch and howling wind.Kilmarnock boss Tommy Wright wasn#t happy with his side#s performance, either, giving the dugout a good whack and his players an earful.Four minutes before the break Dundee did create a look at goal and, once more, McGhee was the man.Mullen did well to get down the left flank before cutting back for the midfielder. McGhee#s effort, though, was deflected into the side-netting.A quick start to the first half was followed by a fast start to the second.Dundee shooting towards the home fans, the script was written for only one man.Harassing play from Christie Elliott saw McMullan pinch the ball off Gary Dicker and cut the ball back.Playing in front of a home crowd for the first time, lelong Dee Adam was on hand to fire the Dark Blues - ahead.And his celebration in front of the cheering fans showed just how much that meant.After  months away it wouldn#t take much to get the Dundee fans behind their team.Their team, though, was responding to every shout, every bit of encouragement from the -strong support.On  minutes it was almost - as Killie let possession slip once more, allowing Mullen to run into the area.His effort was well-struck but Doyle was equal to it with a good stop.With  minutes remaining, Killie got their leline.There was an element of luck about it as a combination of Mullen and Kerr blocked Haunstrup#s first effort.The ball, though, dropped perfectly for the full-back to slot through the legs of Adam Legzdins.And it was almost level just moments later as Legzdins had to be sharp to beat the ball out at his front post.The nerves were obvious from the support every time Kilmarnock ventured forward in the closing stages.There was still plenty going the other way, too, but there would be no more scoring.That leaves Dundee just one game away from promotion back to the top flight, heading to Rugby Park on Monday with a -

Fontaine and Marshall have been training and we’ve no new concerns from last Thursday. We’ve almost a full squad.“I was holding Fontaine back. Marsh, kind of, but it was more trying to control his workload more without risking him in a game.“We wanted to get the high speed running into him because that’s what his game is about.“That’s where his injuries usually come from, so we tried to do that in a controlled way.“We had a - cushion and were confident going into the game. We weren’t going to risk Fontaine because we knew we’d have him back for Thursday’s game.“It’s great to have a full squad to choose from. Jack Hamilton and Fin Robertson are the two senior ones who are missing at the minute but apart from that, everyone is healthy and can play and be on the pitch.”The Dark Blues head into the double-header in good heart after an impressive run of form saw them finish second on the final day of the Championship.Though defeat to Raith last time out ended their nine-match unbeaten streak, the confidence built up won’t be dulled.And McPake says the experience scattered throughout his squad will ensure that is the case.He added: “It’s a boost for our team any time they turn round and look at each other.“Paul McGowan scored a penalty in front of , people at Hampden, a full house, in a semi-final against Celtic.“Shaun Byrne’s won in the playoffs with Livingston. Jason Cummings and Liam Fontaine played in the cup final when Hibs hadn’t won the cup.“I’ve been at Hibs and I know how important that game was for them.“Charlie Adam is an exceptional talent and an exceptional player. He’s got real, real experience of high pressure games.“When you look about our squad, and you see the names of the players in there, then you’re glad they’re standing beside you.#Dundee wow fans with #Fabric of the City# new kit launch ahead of Kilmarnock promotion showdown\" title\"#Dundee wow fans with #Fabric of the City# new kit launch ahead of Kilmarnock promotion showdown# # The Courier\" src\"https:www.thecourier fp sport football dundee-fc  dundee-wow-fans-with-fabric-of-the-city-new-kit-launch-ahead-of-kilmarnock-promotion-showdown embed # secretmuWVH\" data-secret\"muWVH\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/syndicatenews/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/05/Sean-Ferguson-Neil-McCann-599x372.jpg ","title":"i couldnt stop smiling what it means for the lucky dundee fans to be heading to dens park tonight","story":".dct-cta@-webkit-keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate@keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate.dct-cta__title.dct-cta__content p.dct-cta__content p:not.dct-cta__content p:last-child.dct-cta__label.dct-cta__input.dct-cta__input::-webkit-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::-moz-placeholder.dct-cta__input:-ms-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::placeholder.dct-cta__label:hover.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__label:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__input:hover,.dct-cta__input:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__btn .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn.dct-cta__btn:disabled.dct-cta__btn:not.dct-cta__btn:not:hover.dct-cta__btn:not:hover,.dct-cta__btn:not:focus.dct-cta__btn-text.dct-cta__btn:before .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn-loadingborder-top:px solid #fffborder-radius:%width:pxheight:pxbox-sizing:border-box-webkit-animation:dctSpinner .s linear infiniteanimation:dctSpinner .s linear infinite.dct-cta--signup.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--signup__dialogs.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--success.dct-cta--signup__dialog--error.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__grid.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and @media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap+.dct-cta__content@supports or.dct-cta__flex:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--js-active.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap,.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and @supports or.dct-cta__grid:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label,.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__gridgrid-template-columns:fr minmaxgrid-gap:.rem .rem#I couldn’t stop smiling.# #I’m really grateful.# #I’m absolutely buzzing.# #Just delighted.# #You don’t really appreciate it until it’s gone.# #There’s a real buzz around the place.#Dundee fans have waited  days to be allowed back into their Dens Park temple to cheer on their dark blue favourites.The day has finally come for  supporters lucky enough to have had their names plucked out of the hat toto their own hallowed ground.And it’s not just for any old game either # the last home match of the season is the first leg of the Premiership play-off final.Ato the top table of Scottish football is at stake. Kilmarnock are in the way.Whatever the result, Dundee supporters with the golden tickets are just grateful to be back.And they are ready to make their voices heard.“I don’t think I’ve ever answered a call as quick as I did once it started ringing!” says Sean Ferguson, a diehard who hadn’t missed a game, home or away, including pre-season trips, for seven-and-a-half years before the pandemic.“I couldn’t stop smiling. We’ve been hoping and praying all year to get in at some point and it was just a great feeling to be lucky enough to receive the call, I’m really grateful for it.“It’s been really dficult not getting into Dens to see them every week. It really has been hard because watching my team every Saturday is an escape.“It will mean so much to me getting to be there on Thursday. I honestly can’t wait.”mdash sean fergusonMay , Russell Hutchison has been going to Dens since  and a season ticket holder, on and off, for the past  years.“I got the phone call on Monday and, to be honest, I thought I had missed out after not hearing on Sunday,” he said.“I’m just delighted to have been lucky enough to come out of the ballot.“It’s the luck of the draw and I’m thoroughly looking forward to getting back to Dens and getting my bum back on a plastic seat.“There will be no pub, though – I usually go with four mates and I’m the only one to get a ticket.“That’s the big thing I’ve missed, the social aspect of it.”mdash Scott McruvieMay , Ross Day, meanwhile, is normally located in the South Enclosure on a matchday.He’ll be joining the other  lucky souls in the Bobby Cox Stand from an hour-and-a-quarter before kick-off.“I’m absolutely buzzing to get a ticket,” he said.“It’s like getting a ticket for a cup final.“No matter the game,it was a friendly against Brechin, you couldn’t keep me away.“I’ve missed going to Dens big time.“You don’t really appreciate how important it is until it’s gone.“It’s only maybe a couple of hours a week but it’s my time where I can do what I want, let out some frustration.“It’s just not the same on TV, you find your attention wavers and you end up looking at your phone. There’s nowhere near the same engagement as actually being there.“I can’t wait.”Ross has been hard at work over the past year or so setting up the  Foundation for fans to help support the club.For Saturday#s play-off second leg against Raith Rovers, with fans still unable to attend due to coronavirus restrictions, the Foundation sold virtual tickets.The aim was to ‘sell out’ the almost ,-capacity ground with proceeds going directly to the club.• Virtual ticket raised just under k• Now over  members • Over £, a month donated to @DundeeFC from the fans• On course to top £, in their first yearJoin here 👇🏻https:t.co yTAtevSEbmdash The Dee ArchiveMay , He admits that was a tall order but he’s delighted with the money raised to top up their overall tally to more than £, for the past season.“We were just shy of , tickets sold which is around about what we managed the last time,” he added.“Ideally we wanted a sell-out but we’re happy with the end result.“We raised about £, from the game on Saturday and that brings us to around £, for the entire season.“That’s phenomenal really in our first year.“We have around  members now and we hope to see some  Foundation scarves on show for the first time tonight!”The big question, though, is how the match might pan out tonight at Dens Park.Kilmarnock are the big favourites, being the Premiership team, but Dundee have been in good form of late.Ross said: “I’ll take a draw. Going to Rugby Park for a one-off game might suit us.“With these games you go in with more hope than expectation, to be honest.”mdash Dundee Football ClubMay , Russell, meanwhile, has a similar view: “We’ve been playing well and we’ve got goals in us but I’m not bullish.“I think we’ll score but the main thing is the tie is still alive for the second leg.”And Sean adds: “I think it’s all about the first leg,we can go to Kilmarnock on Monday night with either a draw or a win we give ourselves a great chance.“It won’t be easy keeping Kyle Lafferty quiet but we have good players in our team as well, let’s hope the fans can get right behind them and cheer them on to win.“It would mean so much to the club and fans.“With there being no fans in this year the relationship has gotten closer with the club and the fans setting up the  foundation and things like that.“I feel there’s a buzz around the place.”EXCLUSIVE: Dundee stalwart Paul McGowan opens up on making  appearances # #I#ve loved every minute of being a Dundee player but winning promotion would top the lot#\" title\"#EXCLUSIVE: Dundee stalwart Paul McGowan opens up on making  appearances # #I#ve loved every minute of being a Dundee player but winning promotion would top the lot## # The Courier\" src\"https:www.thecourier fp sport football dundee-fc  exclusive-dundee-stalwart-paul-mcgowan-opens-up-on-making--appearances-ive-loved-every-minute-of-being-a-dundee-player-but-winning-promotion-would-top-the-lot embed # secretGdqzlXOIh\" data-secret\"GdqzlXOIh\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest"},{"url":null,"title":"hamilton-grammar-schools-tribute-pupil-brandon-rice","story":"THE headteacher of a pupil who collapsed at home and later died has paid touching tribute to the ldquocharismatic teenager."},{"url":null,"title":"skyes-limit-sabhal-mor-ostaig---unique-gaelic-only-college-set-stunning-island-location","story":"AS global interest in Gaelic grows, students from across the world are travelling to Skye to study at Sabhal Mograver Ostaig, the National Centre for Gaelic Language and Culture."},{"url":null,"title":"new-bbc-documentary-series-jamie-genevieve-great-indoors-air-week","story":"SOCIAL media star Jamie Genevieve will feature in a new documentary series this week."},{"url":null,"title":"list-glasgow-shops-administration-lockdown","story":"GLASGOWS prominent shopping streets will look very dferent post lockdown with many major retailers calling in the administrators."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-memories-milton-couples-love-lasted-lifetime","story":"A PICTURE paints a thousand words, the old saying goes."},{"url":null,"title":"grew-glasgow-its-best-city-world---alexanders-gallowgate-memories","story":"Earliest memory of Glasgow  I remember being scared when the bombs were dropping on Glasgow during the Second World War."},{"url":null,"title":"louisa-jordan-katherine-watt---great-glasgow-nurses-celebrated-international-nurses-day","story":"WE all have a reason to be grateful for nurses and today is all about a celebration in their honour."},{"url":null,"title":"remembering-janey-buchan-fierce-glasgow-mep-fought-civil-rights","story":" Janey Buchan was a fierce cultural and political activist.

taking on the challenge of travelling from Lands’ End to John o’ Groats to raise money for two north-east charities.Riding his Honda C scooter Derek will cover more than  miles of road starting his adventure on Sunday evening.In the process he will raise vital funds for Charlie House # a charity which supports babies, children and young people with complex disabilities and le-limiting conditions and their families in the region.The Leanne Fund will also benefit from Derek’s time on the road. It is considered the foremost Cystic Fibrosis charity in Scotland, working with patients and families across the Highlands, Islands and Grampian to provide vital social, practical, emotional and financial assistance for the whole family.Talking about his upcoming adventure, Derek, Yard Supervisor for John Lawrie Metals, said: “I had originally planned to do the trip to mark my th birthday last year so it’s exciting to finally be counting down to setting off.#I’ll be hitting the road on Monday, May  on my Honda C. It has a top speed of mph and a tank range of about  miles so there will be a few stops along the  plus mile route.#I’ll be followed by a support team and there may even be a surprise visitor popping up. I’m hoping to complete the journey in less than four days.#I would like to thank every person and business, including my employer John Lawrie, that has supported me so far.#I’m delighted with the donations received and of course the generous time my support crew have and will give me throughout the challenge. This trip couldn’t be done on my own so I’m really grateful for everyone’s support.”Donna Deans, fundraising co-ordinator at Charlie House added: “There have been rumours that Charlie Dog is going away for a few days so it’s quite possible that he might show up somewhere between Lands’ End and John o’ Groats to support Derek as he takes on this challenge.“We’re grateful to Derek, and others like him, who continue to think of others and raise money for charity. Their support is incredibly important to us, it helps us to continue our work providing much needed support to babies, children and young people and their families.”Referring to his decision to support Charlie House, Derek added: “I went to a Charlie House Ball in  and was really impressed by the powerful work the charity does. Quite simply I couldn’t ignore the need to do my bit to support them. I have almost reached my initial target of raising £, and now hope to raise even more to benefit the families Charlie House works with, as well as The Leanne Fund.”The funds raised will enable Charlie House to continue its work and to support babies, children and young people with complex disabilities and le-limiting conditions and their families in the north-east of Scotland.Charlie House has a range of services and fundraising activities including The Big Build Appeal, a public fundraising campaign to raise £million for a specialist support centre being built on the grounds of Woodend Hospital.The centre will have eight-bedrooms, with additional family accommodation, set in four acres of ground.The modern building will feature a sensory room, library, spa pool, craft room, teen den, soft play area, therapy room, star room, for end-of-le care and bereavement, outdoor play area and sensory gardens as well as adaptable meeting space and office space for the Charlie House team and medical staff.Charlie House’s services which are currently being run virtually include activity clubs, siblings’ clubs, support from the Charlie House community nurse, one-to-one emotional and practical support from the children and family support manager.It is hoped that their bi-annual adventure trip to Kielder Forest Park, run by the Calvert Trust s following easing of lockdown and ongoing restrictions and when it is safe to do so.To donate to Derek Micthell’s fundraiser visit his Virgin Money Giving Page at https:uk.virginmoneygiving fundraiser-display showROFundraiserPage userUrlDerekMitchell#pageUrlFor as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/05/2.51260071-1-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/05/2.51260071-1-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/05/2.51260071-1-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/05/2.51260071-1-240x180.jpg 300w sizes=(max-width: 940px) 940w, 620w, 300w ","title":"attention fast food fans taco bell to open drive through in aberdeen next month","story":".dct-cta@-webkit-keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate@keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate.dct-cta__title.dct-cta__content p.dct-cta__content p:not.dct-cta__content p:last-child.dct-cta__label.dct-cta__input.dct-cta__input::-webkit-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::-moz-placeholder.dct-cta__input:-ms-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::placeholder.dct-cta__label:hover.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__label:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__input:hover,.dct-cta__input:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__btn .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn.dct-cta__btn:disabled.dct-cta__btn:not.dct-cta__btn:not:hover.dct-cta__btn:not:hover,.dct-cta__btn:not:focus.dct-cta__btn-text.dct-cta__btn:before .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn-loadingborder-top:px solid #fffborder-radius:%width:pxheight:pxbox-sizing:border-box-webkit-animation:dctSpinner .s linear infiniteanimation:dctSpinner .s linear infinite.dct-cta--signup.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--signup__dialogs.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--success.dct-cta--signup__dialog--error.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__grid.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and @media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap+.dct-cta__content@supports or.dct-cta__flex:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--js-active.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap,.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and @supports or.dct-cta__grid:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label,.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__gridgrid-template-columns:fr minmaxgrid-gap:.rem .remAberdeen#s first Taco Bell drive-thru will open next month.The Mexican food franchise opened its first branch in the Granite City last year and it has become hugely popular # with queues of delivery drivers often spotted waiting outside on Union Street during lockdown.Now the chain is opening a second -seat restaurant at Haudagain Retail Park on June .

to transform neglected playing fields that have been littered with needles and dog mess into a safe field of dreams for children to play football.The Thornhill grounds in the south of the Moray town have been popular with dog walkers since being created a decade ago as part of a housing development.However, mess from the household pets as well as reports of needles have put off children from using the park as a regular place for games.Local resident Wayne Grant now has a vision to transform the playing fields into an attractive place for children to stay active while keeping out of trouble.Offshore worker Mr Grant embarked on the campaign to establish two five-a-side pitches and a rounders field to give youngsters a safe place to play.After setting an initial fundraising target of £,, the father-of-two has now raised nearly £, after being inundated with donations from local parents and groups.He hopes his sports daft nine-year-old son Mitchell will be able to enjoy the benefits after becoming frustrated at a lack of progress from where.Not every family can afford to pay to book a pitch.#He said: “We’ve stayed in the Grange development from day one for  years. There were promises of playparks for the kids but nothing has ever happened.“You get a lot of dog walkers here and they just let them foul everywhere and it’s such a shame because it could be such a good place.“Not every family can afford to pay to book a pitch to play, they just want somewhere to kick a ball about.“As soon as I put something on the Grange Facebook page there were a lot of people getting touch to say it was a brilliant idea.“I’ve spoken to the community police officer too.

This is now a key metric that is considered when putting each area into tiers. The colour scales refer to the potential levels recommended by the World Health Organisation.Another key metric is the rate of cases per , people. The chart below shows the seven day rate in each local authority. Similar to the chart above, this chart is also colour coded by the potential levels as recommended by the WHO.In the early stages of the pandemic, cases were more concentrated in older generations. In the last few months this has shted towards cases being more prevalent in younger people – however, cases are declining in the more vulnerable age groups as the vaccine rollout progresses.As the number of daily new cases reduces, the cumulative totals for the health board areas become less important.

Retailers in Scotland have invested tens of millions of pounds on safety measures including plexiglass screens, queue management systems, social distancing signage and floor markings, better ventilation, cleaning and hygiene. Shop workers have ensured the nation was supplied and fed throughout the past  dficult months.The reopening of non-essential shops and ability of food-to-go retailers to resume welcoming customers in-store will mark a crucial milestone for Scottish retail and the wider supply chain. Retail is Scotland’s largest private sector employer. So-called non-essential stores have been compelled to close in Scotland for  consecutive days. The SRC and Usdaw encourage shoppers to:Across Scotland, thousands of shops which have been shuttered for four long months are looking forward to getting back to doing what they do best, serving their customers.Re-opening is good news for our economy, for jobs and for our local communities. It has never been more important to play our part in keeping our towns, cities and retail destinations vibrant.Every purchase from a shop helps to support jobs in local retail and throughout the supply chain.Retailers and their colleagues continue to work around the clock to maintain a safe shopping experience, so customers can have the confidence toto their favourite stores.If we all follow the necessary physical distancing and hygiene measures and show consideration to those around us, including shop staff who are doing a dficult job, then everyone will be better off.David Lonsdale, director of the Scottish Retail ConsortiumThe reopening of stores on Monday offers a leline for many retailers. That is good news in terms of helping to safeguard jobs, but the virus is still out there.We expect employers to conduct full risk assessments, follow the agreed guidance and ensure that customers are fully informed of the necessary safety measures.Shoppers need to play their part in helping to limit the spread of the virus and avoid further lockdowns by following the rules and respecting staff.Regrettably, throughout this appalling pandemic, incidents of abuse towards shop workers doubled and Covid safety measures have now become signicant flashpoints.Abuse should never be part of the job and shop workers – who played a vital role in getting food and medicine into our homes during the pandemic – deserve our thanks and respect.In January, the Scottish Parliament unanimously voted for a ground-breaking new law to protect shop workers.Usdaw campaigned for many years to secure these legal protections and we will continue to work hard to ensure that shop workers are protected and treated with the respect they deserve.Tracey Gilbert, Usdaw deputy isional officer for ScotlandSir,Oxfam’s shops in Argyll and Bute have an urgent need for volunteers to help deal with an anticipated deluge of donations as they prepare to re-open from Monday April .Sales from the first day of trading following the re-opening of its English and Welsh shops were up  per cent on  figures, with it being the most successful Monday ever sales-wise for the organisation outwith Christmas periods.Money raised by the dedicated staff and volunteers in Oxfam#s shops in Dunoon and Rothesay helps fight poverty and injustice around the world providing people with lesaving essentials like clean water and soap as well as the hope of a better future.We know from the last lockdown that people will have taken the chance to have a good declutter and we’re anticipating a deluge of generous donations.Volunteers are asked to give as little as a few hours a week of their time and can take up a range of vital roles, from serving customers to sorting donations and arranging window displays.Each shop typically relies on a team of  dedicated volunteers and one or two staff, with more than , volunteers required across the country.As well as volunteers, Oxfam stores are also appealing for good quality donations.Protecting staff, volunteers and customers from Covid- remains Oxfam’s priority, with shop teams continuing to implement strict protocol, including social distancing, readily available hand sanitiser, masks and gloves for staff, screens at tills, regular and frequent cleaning, closed changing rooms and encouraging contactless payment.In advance of shops re-opening, people are invited to register their interest online via www.oxfam.org.uk # just click on #get involved#.Tom Richardson, Oxfam interim head of retailSir,The demands placed on Scotland’s health service by the pandemic have intensied pleas for an increase in funding for Scottish NHS.NHS funding in Scotland comes from the block grant from Westminster. If huge sums of Scottish taxpayers’ money were not being used to pay Scotland’s share of renewing and maintaining Britain’s nuclear submarine fleet, there would be funds available to properly support the Scottish NHS. This will only be possible when Scotland is independent once more.Susan Swain, Dunbar"},{"url":null,"title":"the softer crofter a land of sustainability","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Our pretty Highlander girls have lost all interest in us now that the grass and rashes are a vivid, succulent green.

So, it’s an easier morning round for us crofters with only the daft pigs to feed, who long ago foraged every root, acorn and pine-cone from their sizeable woodland.Their little forest is perfectly, porcinely ploughed, but they must still be finding some nourishment there as they seem less frantic at feeding-time, pausing their grubbling and guzzling for the occasional scratch and cuddle.The let-up in winter feeding has allowed much-needed attention to be given to the now stuffed-full Polycrub where every speck of soil, every hanging beam has been usefully employed in the mission to feed the family entirely from its harvest.Raspberry canes, lemon, orange and cherry trees should keep rickets at bay, while the plethora of weird and wonderful ieties of carrots, potatoes, asparagus, and squashes will nourish us throughout the season and beyond.Our newbie attempts to live off the land mirror the much more experienced efforts of families throughout theand breadth of this peninsula and in the village beyond. Thanks to those techie neighbours who set up email networks and social media groups there is a fantastic bank of information and expertise shared locally.Whether you want to learn how to plant oak trees, acquire foraging skills or find out how to run your home on renewable energy, somebody local has been there, done it and is happy to point you in the right direction.Over the last few months this valuable mine of knowledge and enthusiasm for environmental projects has been formalised into the Tayvallich Sustainability Plan, a  for sharing information and taking action to create a more sustainable community.The plan has grown organically from a pilot scheme run through the winter months with Keep Scotland Beautul to a website, action plan and monthly activities.Open to everyone with an interest in achieving a healthy, sustainable future for the village and its surroundings, the plan will work on the whole gambit: from food growing to flood mitigation foraging to forestry and heat pumps to bike pumps # a new cycle repair work-stand has been installed outside the village shop.Joining the online meetings throughout the winter, I was amazed to see not just the number of locals involved, but also the extraordinary talents and interests they share.We only entrenched ourselves full time on this wild wee bit of Argyll a month or two before lockdown so we’re not well-kent faces and, likewise, the faces of many villagers I’ve only ever seen strangely pixellated thanks to my dodgy connection to the Zoom meetings.Hopefully the same is true for wi throughout the area and that my, now ubiquitous, Zoom-accompanying glass of wine has stayed safely out of shot."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column april 30 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

That data is supported by further research, carried out specically in rural Scotland, which additionally showed higher support for onshore wind power among young people.#The question posed by the surveyor should, of course, have been: #Are you opposed to further development of onshore wind #In Scotland today we have , operational turbines# that#s more than the rest of the UK put together.We also have , consented  under construction and a further , in the planning system according to an FOI response from the Scottish Government.These figures change on an almost daily basis as applications continue to pile in unabated.How many people are going to continue to support onshore wind when they witness the total annihilation of this country It would also be interesting to know exactly where the data from #rural Scotland# was collected. Was it perhaps in an area where there were no wind farms in sight of  the local communities which were questioned but where they were still able to take advantage of any community benefit on offer If successful, the public petition recently submitted to the Scottish Parliament by campaign group Scotland Against Spin should help to clary exactly how much support there really is for further onshore wind development in Scotland.Aileen Jackson, Knockglass, UplawmoorSir,I have been contacted by a number of my justiably concerned constituents about the recent removal of a cattle grid on the Isle of Gigha from the road between the ferry jetty and the village.The space has been tarred over but I have been informed by residents that unfortunately the sub surface area was just grit and so the tar has subsided due to traffic including tractors and lorries. The dip now is actually worse than when the cattle grid was in place.To make matters worse, the damaged cattle grid which is now mangled metal has been left on the adjacent roadside verge.It is my strong belief thatcattle grids are damaged the roads department should replace them with new, fit-for-propose cattle grids, not get rid of them all together.Not only should road repairs be made to last, but at the very least the roads department should clean up after itself and remove old damaged materials # such as this # left behind. If a private company or an inidual member of the public left a large amount of scrap metal at the side of the road they would be in trouble.I have contacted our roads# management through member services and asked them to recty this matter as soon as possible.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward Sir,I am a GP in one of Argyll’s rural practices. Last week I was having a busy morning so was a little later than usual getting back to my car, which I had left charging at an electric charge point.That evening I was surprised to see that I’d been charged £ over and above the normal charging rate per KwH. I checked through the Argyll and Bute website and discovered that there is now an overstay charge – hence the surcharge.I had had an email back in April saying that Argyll and Bute Council would now be charging users at its charge points – the cost being p per KwH. Fair enough.However, there was no mention of a penalty for overstaying.

It involves GPs, nurses, an army of health professionals and lots of support staff. It is essentialwe are to achieve what the publicsay is a priority, enjoying a healthy le. As the founders of the NHS said: #From the cradle to the grave#.Hiding in plain sight in this report, in the small print, is this statement: #Politicians, health care professionals and the public must all be involvedour primary care system is to survive.# As Oprah Winfrey would put it, #WHAT # If this is what is at stake, why have we not heard more about it  Why was it enough to contact so few people among our erse population Why has health management locally cast our group out in the cold We are open to all and represent a wide cross section of community interests. And their latest distancing act is to #temporarily suspend# public representation on its Integration Joint Board.I am coming to believe that this critical situation has overtaken long-held belief systems that need to be challenged.In NHS values, the first statement is #working together for patients.#That is well out of date increasingly the patient has been a participator in their care, and the duty of obtaining consent means you can’t have treatment without co-operation.This report goes on to make clear that #collaboration# is a key requirement. That means we are an essential part of the system.It seems clear that we are going to have to fight to get past the unconscious assumptions of decision makers.

We once again highlighted our concerns over a lack of immediate action on the crisis at the Rest and be ThankfulDear Roy and Hugh,I am writing in response to an official Transport Scotland email to the Rest and be Thankful Campaign on the April , where you have sought to answer several questions posed by us at our meeting with your officials and in subsequent emails to you both. We are hugely disappointed by this response and its apparent contradictions.We asked for a permanent solution within the next three years. The email states #we are not waiting for anything and are pushing on with work at pace# yet your actions since the August landslide have only created delay.We believe creating  options for consultation in November  and five further options for consultation in March was a time-wasting exercise. We strongly believe there are only three real options, with studies on these completed in your  report.A geological survey, which will take  months to complete, could have started last August, assuming you had not conducted such surveys in .We have asked for temporary use of the forestry road, away from the threats posed by landsides.The email states: #We were clear without that information we are not certain the forestry track in its current form is safe for use#, yet we would argue you already have a Transerv report produced in  by Balfour Beatty and Mouchal Services Ltd for Transport Scotland which suggested the forestry road could be upgraded in - weeks. How did Transerv arrive at this conclusion without a study of the ground conditions being done in advance This situation should be considered a safety, economic and social emergency, cutting through the red tape of consultation and delay.It further declares that #we understand first-hand the delay that can be caused by procedural challenge…there needs to be a careful balancing of accelerating development and procedural risk in order to ensure that we do not end up in the courts#.While we understand the need for the right balance of speed and consultation, we think the safety risks, costs incurred by business and damage to the economy of Argyll should create the conditions for emergency action, delivering what should be a simple road realignment.This is not HS, we are not asking to blight the countryside or people#s homes you do not have whole communities ready to challenge fixing the crisis at the Rest and be Thankful. What we want cannot be worse than the damage already inflicted on the hillside without consultation. If you fixed the rest, we will all be thankful.The following questions still have not been answered in Transport Scotland#s official reply or in recent press statements:If the next landslide, or subsequent ersion along the equally inadequate A, results in a fatality who will be held accountable Who is responsible for the social and economic impact on the people and businesses of Argyll while we wait another  years for something permanent to be done We are business people and understand the need for safe environments, effective procedures, timely management and cost control, but what we have experienced over the past year does not give us confidence you will address the concerns we have.We are not looking for you to defend your approach, what matters to us is the action taken to bring timescales down and resolve the problem within the next parliament.We are simply asking you to rethink your approach, look at how your team can cut through this #business as usual# process and appoint someone who can find a way to realign two km of the A safely within the next three years.By challenging your approach, we are hoping to see that after nearly a year of delay and ersion, there is a recognition of the cost impact to business, the signicant safety concerns, and that this will continue to blight Argyll as a place to live, work, and invest in until a permanent solution is delivered.We will be working with the relevant politicians post elections and will continue to campaign for a change in approach.We would be happy to discuss what can be done to overcome any constraints you have to deliver a solution quickly and resolve the crisis at the Rest and be Thankful.John Gurr, chairman, The Rest and be Thankful CampaignSir,Mental Health Awareness Week opened on Monday May  and we are inviting everyone to #ConnectWithNature to support their mental health.Spending quality time in and around nature can help to reduce stress and increase feelings of positivity, and you don’t have to be surrounded by fields or have to take a walk in the wilderness to feel the benefits.The Mental Health Foundation, which works to prevent mental health problems and has organised this awareness week for the past  years, encourages you to recognise and grow your connection with nature by sharing a photo, video or sound recording with your family and friends, and on your social media.Connecting with nature can really make a dference to your mental health, and now more than ever, it is time to look after yours.Julie Walters, actorSir,Alan Reid, Dunoon"},{"url":null,"title":"riverside kids vote for nature","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

I was really pleased to find a company that does dehydrated vegan food in compostable bags, so I bought  meals and have mailed them in batches to post offices around the country so I can collect them as I travel.#As far as training for such an extraordinary expedition is concerned, Ben explained that he has participated in several endurance events, including multi-day running, in the past, but, now three weeks since he left his starting point of Glasgow he is enjoying this trip more than these previous competitions.#I’m loving this as it’s not all ‘Go, Go , Go’. I want to be able to sit back and take time and explore all the dferent parts of the coast. This trip has given me time to write, which is something I’ve wanted to do for a while.#Ben’s blog can be read on his website where he has also written in detail about the threat plastic litter poses to marine le and the environment in general.#I wasn’t brought up by the sea I’m from Manchester,# Ben adds. #I worked at a youth hostel in Ullapool for a couple of years and felt a connection there.#When I’m picking up rubbish on beaches I feel really up and down about it all.#I feel so sad about what I find, and also about the amount that’s below the ocean’s surface. But then I realise I need to do what I can.#On that note, Ben is keen to work together with locals who want to make a dference.He is helping out at a beach clean in Oban this Friday, May . Information on this and how to donate to the John Muir Trust or the Marine Conservation Society can be found on Ben’s www.ukcoastjourney website."},{"url":null,"title":"lots to do for new argyll and bute msp","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Irsquove always been happy with my online job and content creation, but when I went for a meeting with the team, I just loved them ndash they were so passionate about the show, and I just thought lsquookay, letrsquos try it out!rsquoThe popular home show continues to attract a strong following in its third series,Spiers believes demand will be at an all-time high. ldquoI think itrsquos a really great programme to go on after so long in lockdown, she highlights.ldquoWhen everyonersquos been looking at the same four walls for the last year, lots of people have big plans for what theyrsquore going to do with their homes, and for when they can have tradesmen back into the house, so I think watching an interiors show is going to be inspiring for people hellip a welcome bit of voyeurism.Despite the fluctuating restrictions of the pandemic last year, the crew, alongside Spiersrsquos fellow judges interior designer Anna Campbell-Jones and architect Michael Angus, were able to film series three last September.ldquoI would not recommend filming during a pandemic, laughs Spiers. ldquoWe would do Covid tests every couple of days, get temperature checks twice a day ndash we constantly had thermometers hanging out of our mouths.ldquoWe were really lucky we could get out to film, and it was great to see more of Scotland.Originally from New Zealand, Spiers considers herself an honorary Scot since moving here as a child. The content creator has a weighty , followers on Instagram, many of whom were gained over the last year alone. ldquoMy following grew massively during the pandemic, she explains, ldquowhereas it hadnrsquot grown that much in the last couple of years.One of the main reasons for this influx is Spiersrsquos dreamy, aesthetically pleasing interiors.ldquoI would think my niche, or my USP, is probably that I live quite a simple le ndash I view my content as being attainable but slightly aspirational.ldquoMy husband and I live in a three-bedroom tenement flat in the southside of Glasgow ndash itrsquos far from a mansion, but it has period detailing and wersquove done a lot of work to make it our own and inject our personality into it. Itrsquos also a style that is easy to replicate.ldquoIrsquom quite inspired by Southern Calornian style ndash lots of wood and greenery, earthy tones, and textures. I bring a lot of that into my home, I love rattan and a bit of s style. I think Irsquove created quite a colourful home that brings me a lot of joy.So, after being able to add TV presenter to her ever-growing CV, whatrsquos next for Spiers  ldquoWriting is my passion, she emphasises. ldquoI would love to write a book one day, a collection of essays, I think ndash thatrsquos something Irsquove always been leading up to. Although everybody always wants me to do an interiors book!Kate shares her top tips to freshen up your home for springThere is no better time to refresh your home than the start of a new season, and the arrival of spring definitely brings with it a chance to declutter and revive your space. So, throw open your windows, stock up on blossom-scented cleaning supplies and follow my steps for freshening up your home for spring hellipDeep clean and declutter:Spring is the perfect time to assess your home and see what you can donate or throw out. Irsquove made multiple trips to the recycling centre lately and it really has made a dference to my home ndash I know Irsquoll never be a minimalist, but it feels calming to have a little less clutter at least.Set aside an hour or so once a week to clear out your wardrobe, kitchencabinets and hallway cupboards.Reorganise sideboards and shelves, and get rid of anything you havenrsquot used or worn in a while ndash be ruthless! Then give everything a once-over as you go ndash spring cleaning is good for the soul.Have a room refresh:Changing the layout of a room and giving your home a bit of a rejig does wonders for making the space feel like new. Once or twice a year Irsquoll consider how I can switch up my spaces. Irsquoll move furniture, swap out soft furnishings, relocate the sofa to another position or change our spare room completely. Irsquoll even rework the gallery walls and artwork around my home. Itrsquos like redecorating but without spending a penny.Bring the outdoors:in Stock up on tulips, daffodils and peonies, and place bouquets around your home ndash on mantelpieces, sideboards, kitchen worktops and coffee tables. Irsquom a big fan ofgreenery in the home too ndash plants like Pothos, Monstera deliciosa and ZZ plants are so easy to take care of and really breathe a bit of le into a room. Irsquom all about the indoor jungle, so go wild with blooms and plants and your home will feel bright and breezy in no time.Consider a lick of paint:With so many fun paint brands launching lately , itrsquos easier than ever to add colour to your le. Opt for a fresh eucalyptus green to revive a bathroom, or pick a played-down pink for warmth. Go wild with it ndash paint a feature wall in your living room or section off a room with a dado rail and paint the lower section a bright shade. Bold colours never go out of style.www.katelavie"},{"url":null,"title":"10-best-museums-galleries-edinburgh-glasgow","story":"Kelvingrove Art Gallery And Museum, Kelvingrove, GlasgowOne of the gems in Glasgowrsquos art crown, Kelvingrove re-opens on Monday giving punters the chance to enjoy its world-beating collection.

It will help protect the people around you, and help us avoid anotherto lockdown.\"It may be tempting to think as vaccinations increase and cases drop, that testing will become less important.\"In fact, this will only make it more important to spot and prevent new outbreaks as cases emerge.\"We know from our experience of last summer just how quickly one outbreak can lead to another.\"This also applies regardless of whether you have been vaccinated or not.\"While the latest evidence suggests vaccines provide a high level of protection against the effects of Covid-, they dont yet provide a guarantee that you cant still get the virus or pass it on to others.\"How do I take a test Follow these stepsyoursquore doing a rapid LFD test at home.Read the instructions that come with your test kit.Clean and dry a flat surface and wash or sanitise your hands before you start.Once you have removed the test strip from its packet, start the test within  minutes.Carefully open the extraction buffer sachet tube.Open the extraction tube and pour in all the liquid.Close the cap and put the extraction tube in the holderBlow your nose.Clean your hands again.Remove the swab from the packet. Do not touch the fabric tipof the swab.Open your mouth wide and rub the fabric tip over both tonsils . Do this  times on each side. Itrsquos normal to find this a bit uncomfortable.Using the same swab, insert it up your nostril until you feel resistance.Rotate the swab in your nostril  times.Pick up the extraction tube, open the lid and place the fabric tip of the swab in the fluid in the tube.Firmly press the swab against the bottom-inside of the tube and rotate it around for  seconds. Itrsquos important to mix thoroughly.Pinch the tube as you remove the swab and put the nozzle cap on.Squeeze the extraction tube to place two drops of fluid on the test strip. Watch out for any air bubbles.Set a timer for  minutes and leave the test strip on a clean, flat surface.Once your test is complete, place all used test kit contents in the waste bag provided and put this in your bin.Where testing takes place - community testing sitesIfyou do not have coronavirus symptoms but live in a community that has been targeted for testing, you can access a test at a rapid test site.These are only available in some parts of Scotland.You can usually just turn up and do not need to book in advance ndash but you should check the arrangements at your local site first.You will be tested using a lateral flow devicewhich involves taking a swab or saliva sample.You should usually get your result within an hour.Island testingThe First Minister also added that people visiting the islands should take two lateral flow tests before travelling.Nicola Sturgeon said: \"We are keeping island communities at the same level as the rest of the country at the moment, so that we can allow travel between island communities and the rest of Scotland.\"But we know this does create a risk for our island communities.\"Many of them currently have very, very low rates of Covid.\"And they will be welcoming visitors from parts of Scotland which I know many of them are looking forward to where Covid will still be circulating at a higher level and more widely.\"So If you are planning to travel to an island we do encourage you to take two lateral flow tests before you depart.\"The second test should be on the day that you are planning to travel, and the first should be three days before you travel.\"That means thatyou test positive, you have a chance to take a PCR test - which is more sensitive - to confirm the result before making a final decision on cancelling your visit.\"This is potentially an important way in which we can minimise the risk, of bringing Covid into island communities while nevertheless allowing our island communities the benefit of opening up again to visitors.\"Soyou are planning on travelling to an island over the course of next week, it is possible to get tests from today, and I would encourage you to do that.\""},{"url":null,"title":"times-league-table-borders-high-schools-appear-top-50","story":"A LEAGUE table of Scottish secondary schools has been published by The Timesndash and the Borders has two in the top .The newspaper creates rankings every year based on the proportion of pupils achieving five or more Highers.This years editionwas published in print on Wednesday, May , showing a total of  schools in the country.GalashielsAcademy has risen by more than  places compared with last years chart.The Elm Row school is now in th place ndash up from last yearrsquos finish of th, as reported in the print edition of The Times.: Talented executive director is leaving Scottish Borders Council for new jobAccording to the latest statistics,  per cent of Gala Academy pupils achieved five or more Highers in .That is up on , which saw  per cent of Gala pupils complete the feat.In this yearrsquos table, only Earlston High Schooland Peebles High Schoolfinished above Gala Academy among the high schools in the Borders.Sixty-seven per cent of pupils at Earlston managed five or more Highers in , an increase of  per cent on rsquos figure .Meanwhile,  per cent of Peebles High pupils achieved five or more Highers last year, up from  per cent in .: Historic mansion near Borders saved from demolition following outcry over plansThe other Borders schools named in the rankings were Jedburgh Grammar School , Selkirk High School , Berwickshire High School , Kelso High School , Eyemouth High Schooland Hawick High School .As a region, the Borders council area was th in a league table of Scottish councils after . per cent of pupils graduated with five or more Highers.That is a . per cent increase on rsquos figure .A Scottish Borders Council spokesperson said: \"There is a lot of good work going on right across the nine high schools in the Borders and it should be noted that there are a number of dferent ways of measuring the health and success of a school.\"The top performing school in the latest table based on this metric was Jordanhill School, Glasgow, which recorded an  per cent success rate of pupils recording five or more Highers.The lowest performing school was Craigroyston Community High School, Edinburgh, which recorded nine per cent of pupils achieving the feat."},{"url":null,"title":"covid-vaccine-passport-scheme-announced-scotland","story":"A new scheme that will allow Scots to prove they have been vaccinated against coronavirus before travelling abroad has been launched by the Scottish Government.Those who have been vaccinated can download a letter from the NHS Inform patient website, or request a letter from the Covid Status Helplinethey are not online.But as details of the vaccination status scheme were announced, Scotlandrsquos Chief Medical Officer Dr Gregor Smith urged people to be \"highly cautious about international travel\"and ldquocontinue to limit their travel abroad.Only those travelling to a country where proof of vaccination is needed as an entry requirement should request a letter.There are currently no countries that require travellers to show their vaccination status, but the letter scheme is being introduced because international travel requirements can change quickly during the pandemic.What to do before going abroad:If yoursquore planning to travel abroad, you must:check whether a country yoursquore travelling to is on the red, amber or green listconfirm what you need to do when you arrive back in ScotlandCountries may move between the green, amber and red lists at short notice.You should not assume that a country on the green, amber or red list now will remain on the same list over the weeks and months ahead.Before you travelYoull also need to:have taken a coronavirus testin the threedays before you begin your journey to Scotland -

The dip now is actually worse than when the cattle grid was in place.To make matters worse, the damaged cattle grid, which is now mangled metal, has been left on the adjacent roadside verge.It is my strong belief thatcattle grids are damaged, the roads department should replace them with new fit-for-propose cattle grids, not get rid of them all together.Not only should road repairs be made to last but at the very least the roads department should clean up after itself and remove old damaged materials such as this left behind.If a private company or an inidual member of the public left a large amount of scrap metal at the side of the road they would be in trouble.I have contacted our roads management through member services and asked them to recty this matter as soon as possible.I am a GP in one of Argyll#s rural practices. Last week I was having a busy morning so was a little later than usual getting back to my car, which I had left charging at an electric charge point.That evening I was surprised to see that I#d been charged £ over and above the normal charging rate per KwH.I checked through the Argyll and Bute website and discovered that there is now an overstay charge – hence the surcharge.I had received an email back in April saying that Argyll and Bute Council would now be charging users at its charge points – the cost being p per KwH. Fair enough.However, there was no mention of a penalty for overstaying. Nor is there any notice at the charge points themselves, save a tiny notice stating #charges apply#.Those seeking to charge in Argyll and Bute are additionally confused by the lack of clarity over what type of charge point is being used: is it a  Kw, Kw or a  Kw. There is no notice on the chargers. This is important because the overstay timings y according to the dfering units.When I buy petrol at a filling station, I clearly know what the charges are when I buy a ticket at a parking meter, I buy a ticket and know exactly how long I am able to park there.But it seems that for electric vehicles you have to search the internet to find out the rules – and in my village there is no local WiFi and I cannot get G on my phone.As a responsible democrat I thought, when this election was called, that I would write to the candidates to ask them a few questions before deciding how to vote.We had no hustings this time, even in Campbeltown, and our MSP has not visited the town for ages. So election time seems to be the only opportunity to enter into dialogue with those who want to represent us.Last year I published a book about the uncertain future for the rule of law in Scotland. The irreducible basis of a rule-of-law society is reciprocity between those who make the laws and those who have to obey them. Without dialogue, that is impossible.Only two parties sent me a leaflet with enough time to allow an exchange of emails: first the SNP and then the LibDems.I started by asking the SNP candidate, Jenni Minto, for a CV. That was initially refused, then a redacted one sent. Next, I asked about the Hate Crime Act. I got a long answer ending with a quotation from the English philosopher, Karl Popper: #In order to maintain a tolerant society, the society must be intolerant to intolerance.#I wrote back quoting Bertrand Russell, who said that enforced morality is not morality at all it is pure obedience. Likewise, enforced tolerance is not tolerance, just obedience. I asked what she thought of the criminalisation of dinner-time conversations and other aspects of the Act. It was at that point that the dialogue broke down.I changed the subject to independence. This time I did get a reply, but it was evasive.For example, I had asked what the most important features of the UK were that made her want Scotland to leave it. Ms Minto replied that an independent country would get the government it votes for. That implied thatScotland and England voted for the same party, there would be no need for independence. So, by extension, whatArgyll wanted a dferent government from that in Holyrood  Should it declare independence from Scotland, as Orkney and Shetland have said they willthe UK breaks up  I wrote for clarication, but Ms Minto did not reply.I also wrote to Alan Reid of the LibDems. He sent a CV, but when I replied to that with questions about LibDem policy, I heard nothing more.That, in Scotland, appears to be the limit of dialogue between the rulers and the ruled. Perhaps that explains something about the parliament itself.With Sun Awareness Week taking place this week, Cats Protection would like to advise cat owners to be aware of the risks posed to their cat by the sun.Pale-coloured cats, or those with unpigmented white noses or ears, are particularly at risk from the sun#s rays which can cause sunburn and skin cancer.Those affected can suffer long-term damage including, in severe cases, having to have their ear tips removed to prevent the cancer from spreading.Following a few simple tips owners can help protect their cat from the harmful effects of the sun.These include keeping them indoors on sunny days between am and pm, asking your vet for advice about suitable sunscreen and ensuring you provide plenty of shade to enable your cat to shelter from the sun#s rays."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week may 7 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Yet, at the same time, we are becoming increasingly suspicious that the label on freedom has been switched.For some people appear to be devaluing freedom. They seem to think it means no constraints on their behaviour. They have the right to do whatever they want, evenit causes damage to themselves, to others and to the environment.Jesus makes it clear that freedom is something quite dferent. It is being set free from the tyrannical oppression of our own self-centredness – what the Bible calls sin – empowering us to be free to love God by willingly obeying his Word and to love others by humbly looking out for their best interests.Not only did Jesus tell us in his teaching and show us by his example what label freedom should have, but by his real death on the cross, his physical and historical resurrection and the gt of his Spirit, he made it possible for us to experience it.We must not be conned by the switch that has been made to freedom#s label.Instead, let us restore its label back to its correct, Jesus-defined and le-changing setting, and through faith in Jesus alone, value and enjoy the freedom he secured by his death."},{"url":null,"title":"happy lockdown birthday joanne","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The shutdown means the loss of nine jobs at the plant, but local farmers believe the knock-on effect on employment will be even worse.Farmer and shareholder in the company Tony Archibald said: #It could mean the loss of another job on every dairy farm, not to mention the milk tanker driver.#The farmers are looking at ways of opening the creamery. It is very important because it is the one thing we have as a raw material for over here.#The farmers were due to meet as the Courier went to press to discuss ways of re-opening the creamery and they also plan to meet representatives of Scottish Milk.Mr Coffield described the closure as #devastating#. He said: #There#s not a lot of work round here. The main feeling about the place is disbelief.#The creamery produced about  tonnes of cheese a year.FIFTY YEARS AGOColour TV comes to CampbeltownColour television is to be launched in Campbeltown next Tuesday by Redfusion.And to mark the occasion, Redfusion is staging a demonstration exhibition in the town#s White Hart Hotel, where about six sets will be on view.The exhibition will be open to the public for three days.

We are hugely disappointed by this response and its apparent contradictions.We asked for a permanent solution within the next three years. The email states: #We are not waiting for anything and are pushing on with work at pace#, yet your actions since the August landslide have only created delay.Creating  options for consultation in November , this, we believe, is a time-wasting exercise. Five further options for consultation in March. We strongly believe there are only three real options, with studies on these completed in your  report. Conducting a geological survey which will take eighteen months to complete, a process that could have started last August, assuming you had not conducted such surveys in .We have asked for temporary use of the forestry road, away from the threats posed by landsides. It also states: #We were clear without that information we are not certain the forestry track in its current form is safe for use.# Yet we would argue you already have a Transerv report produced in  by Balfour Beatty and Mouchal Services Ltd for TS which suggested the forestry road could be upgraded in  to  weeks. How did Transerv arrive at this conclusion without a study of the ground conditions being done in advance This situation should be considered a safety, economic and social emergency, cutting through the red tape of consultation and delay. It further declares: #We understand first-hand the delay that can be caused by procedural challenge…there needs to be a careful balancing of accelerating development and procedural risk in order to ensure that we do not end up in the courts.#While we understand the need for the right balance of speed and consultation, we think the safety risks, costs incurred by business and damage to the economy of Argyll, should create the conditions for emergency action, delivering what should be a simple road realignment. This is not HS, we are not asking to blight the countryside, or people#s homes, you do not have whole communities ready to challenge fixing the crisis at RABT.What we want cannot be worse than the damage already inflicted on the hillside without consultation. If you fixed the Rest, we will all be thankful.The following questions still have not been answered in TS#s official reply or in recent press statements:We are business people and understand the need for safe environments, effective procedures, timely management, and cost control, but what we have experienced over the past year does not give us confidence you will address the concerns we have.We are not looking for you to defend your approach, what matters to us is the action taken to bring timescales down and resolve the problem within the next parliament. We are simply asking you to rethink your approach, look at how your team can cut through this #business as usual# process and appoint someone who can find a way to realign two kilometres of the A safely within the next three years.By challenging your approach, we are hoping to see that after nearly a year of delay and ersion, there is a recognition of the cost impact to business, the signicant safety concerns, and that this will continue to blight Argyll as a place to live, work, and invest in until a permanent solution is delivered.We will be working with the relevant politicians post elections and will continue to campaign for a change in approach. We would be happy to discuss what can be done to overcome any constraints you have to deliver a solution quickly and resolve the crisis at the RABT.We stand at a once-in-a-generation crossroads.Earlier this week, a thought-provoking poem, ACCEPTABLE  by the Anonymous Mother # judged for needing a food bank to feed her child # started a nationwide debate about whether the world#s fth richest country should need food banks to feed children.This conversation needed to happen as our food bank crisis has become critical.Last year food banks in the Trussell Trust#s network handed out , emergency food parcels for children in the UK. This surely cannot be acceptable.However, fate has given us a rare opportunity, as history shows us that the best time to create a brighter future is after times of great darkness.The pandemic has been the most devastating event to hit our country since the Second World War, but it also brought out the very best of our nation.We recognised our real community heroes, we protected the vulnerable, we didn#t stand by when kids went hungry.But now, as we prepare to wake up from the pandemic nightmare, millions of British families still cannot afford food on their table.As the Anonymous Mother poetically says # it doesn#t need to be this way.In , Britain woke up to its new dawn at a similar crossroads # go back to the old broken way, or use this golden opportunity to make things better.That great generation chose hope, and created a better, fairer society for all # including founding the NHS.This pandemic has been our generation#s darkest hour. This is now our new dawn, our choice. Will we choose the old broken way, or use this golden opportunity to eradicate hunger in the UK I urge you to do just one thing today, and that is to seek out the poem that started all of this, and reflect.If, afterwards, you agree with me and the hundreds of thousands of other supporters of the Trussell Trust, that we can do better, join us as we collectively create a #hunger free future#."},{"url":null,"title":"photograph of the week may 14 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

I was really pleased to find a company that does dehydrated vegan food in compostable bags, so I bought  meals and have mailed them in batches to post offices around the country so I can collect them as I travel.#As far as training for such an extraordinary expedition is concerned, Ben explained that he has participated in several endurance events, including multi-day running, in the past, but, now three weeks since he left his starting point of Glasgow he is enjoying this trip more than these previous competitions.#I’m loving this as it’s not all ‘Go, Go , Go’. I want to be able to sit back and take time and explore all the dferent parts of the coast. This trip has given me time to write, which is something I’ve wanted to do for a while.#Ben’s blog can be read on his website where he has also written in detail about the threat plastic litter poses to marine le and the environment in general.#I wasn’t brought up by the sea I’m from Manchester,# Ben adds. #I worked at a youth hostel in Ullapool for a couple of years and felt a connection there.#When I’m picking up rubbish on beaches I feel really up and down about it all.#I feel so sad about what I find, and also about the amount that’s below the ocean’s surface. But then I realise I need to do what I can.#On that note, Ben is keen to work together with locals who want to make a dference.He is helping out at a beach clean in Oban this Friday, May . Information on this and how to donate to the John Muir Trust or the Marine Conservation Society can be found on Ben’s www.ukcoastjourney website."},{"url":null,"title":"new member makes his mark at dunaverty","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

It#s a really exciting move as it offers the potential to climb the Scottish football pyramid.#From the club#s point of view, we want to find our standard amongst the new teams joining the set up.#We want to be the best we can be as the senior team of the Campbeltown and District Community Football Club.#With our acceptance into the WoSFL, we can offer a pathway for the youngest age groups right through to the under- side, being trained by Stuart Crossan, into our first team, representing Campbeltown in non-league football.#With that, it#s important to acknowledge the huge amount of hard work that has gone into making Campbeltown#s community club a Gold Merit Award holder, one of only seven clubs in the Scottish Football AssociationWest region, encompassing all of Glasgow and the west. This accolade was a major factor in our acceptance into the WoSFL.#Other factors in the Pupils# favour before WoSFL committee scrutiny included having changing facilities for two teams of up to  players each, a separate referee#s room, and an enclosed ground with spectator barriers.Campbell said of the club#s Kintyre Park home: #The renovation of the pavilion is nearing completion, through a fundraising campaign led by club chairman Alex McKinven.#Campbell added: #The SAFL was a great  for us to play competitive amateur football for  years. In periods, we went through some wilderness years but we have happy memories of successful title-winning seasons, too.#In recent seasons, however, the club became disillusioned with how the league was going, with dficulty getting referees and sometimes teams to travel to Kintyre at a week#s notice – this was not a feature against even rival teams in years gone by.#In the WosFL, our geography could not be a determining factor in league entry as we are SFA West region members, which meant that the criteria we could meet on a match day, and the quality of our community club pathway, mattered most.#Meanwhile, the Pupils are gearing up for le in the WoSFL with contact training resuming on Tuesday evening.The team have been training twice weekly in a non-contact setting to build up their base fitness since March.Campbell added: #Training has been well attended, led by coaches Norman Thomson and Lewis Mackay, and although it has been hard to get the players together with ongoing restrictions, the squad are right behind the move and excited about the challenge ahead.#Campbeltown Pupils are keen to hear from anyone who would be able to help with ground and park maintenance.

As German troops advanced through Normandy, the st fought valiantly, protecting French citizens, hoping evacuation by sea would be forthcoming.On June  , German tanks surrounded the ision at the French fishing port of St Valéry. This, alongside a curtain of heavy fog, made the long-awaited flotilla rescue unviable and they were forced to surrender. Those who were not killed in the fighting were captured as prisoners of war and marched to camps in Eastern Europe, where they remained for five gruelling years.Following the commemorations to mark the th anniversary of the battle last June, a remarkable story has emerged. One brave soldier miraculously evaded capture and was taken in by a French family who hid him from the occupying German forces.#We were contacted by Monsieur Patrick Prieur, a -year-old St Valéry resident whose grandparents and father remained in the town during the entirety of the war. He told us the story of the escapee and the tragedy that befell him,# said Dr Claire Armstrong, chief executive of Legion Scotland.#As we approach the st anniversary of the battle, we hope to identy this Scottish hero, give him the recognition he deserves and bring peace to his family.#Patrick Prieur recalled the tale his late father told him: #A soldier from the st Highland Division was hidden by a family in the village. They bonded and the family learned he was a married man with a we and two daughters waiting for him tohome.#For several weeks, the soldier remained hidden but, regretfully, he was eventually discovered by German troops and marched through the town to the municipal cemetery.#After being forced to dig his own grave, he was positioned against the cemetery wall and shot. His death deeply upset the townspeople, who had been aware of his hiding, and especially my father, who was only  at the time.#In later years, the Franco-British military cemetery was built and his body was moved there. His grave is marked as #Known unto God# and my father and other villagers tended to it for decades after the war ended.#Monsieur Prieur added: #My father had been gted a piece of paper on which the soldier#s name was written, #Keller Len Scott#, and this became his prized possession. He desperately wanted to find the soldier#s family to tell them what had happened to their beloved and where he was laid to rest, but having very little information, he struggled.#In  my father passed away and, being eager to finish what he started, I recently contacted Poppyscotland and the Highland Reserve Forces# and Cadets# Association to ask for help.#Michelle McKearnon, head of engagement at the Highland Reserve Forces# and Cadets# Association, said: #We started to do our own research to unearth the fallen soldier#s identity but only got so far. We believe the name order on the piece of paper may have been written in military fashion, with the surname preceding any given names, so the family name might be Keller.#We#re now at an impasse, struggling to find additional information through our own resources, so we need the knowledge of the wider community to continue our efforts.#Dr Armstrong added: #We are urging anyone who believes they know of or has any information about our #Unknown Soldier#, no matter how small, to get in touch.#This brave man fought valiantly for his country and to repay our debt to him for his service would be an honour, not only for Legion Scotland as custodians of remembrance, but for his family, Monsieur Prieur#s father, the people of St Valéry and, ultimately, for all the #unknown soldiers# who sacriced their lives for us.#Anyone with information that could help identy the soldier should visit poppyscotland.org.uk stvalery"},{"url":null,"title":"engines at the ready mach 1 stages rally gets go ahead","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

They did notto the harbour until after pm with the casualty in tow.The following day, Sceptre skipper Tom Smith praised the hard work and efficiency of the Campbeltown leboat crews.Diver Robert Lamont, a member of the leboat crew the night before, went in and removed the damaged rudder ready for Sceptre to be towed by tug to Troon, the finish of the race.The race sails from Oban to Mull, Jura and Arran then Troon, stopping at each island for a team of runners to complete a hill race.Sceptre, with a crew of four, was carrying the boys# team from Glenalmond School, Perth.She had run aground the night before entering Craighouse, Jura.

The Type  Clyde-built destroyer stood by until the leboat arrived.TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AGOCalls were mounting earlier this week for a Scottish Office decision on the proposed ferry link between Campbeltown and Northern Ireland.The Scottish Office has been considering a business plan for state-owned Caledonian MacBrayne to operate the link with Ballycastle in Northern Ireland since the beginning of February.The company needs Scottish Office permission to become involved in the project.But concern is growing that unless a decision is made soon the necessary harbour work at Campbeltown will not start until it is too late for the service to begin next year.Two Campbeltown ambulance men were among six from Argyll recently presented with long service and good conduct medals by the Duke of Argyll.Ronnie Hamilton and Malcolm Black travelled to Oban for the presentation, carried out by the Duke on behalf of HM Queen.The medals are not awarded automatically but are made on the recommendation of a special .The Duke told the ambulance men: #What you do is not a profession, it is a vocation.#He also paid tribute to their families, pointing out the ambulance men worked anti-social hours for long periods at a time.FIFTY YEARS AGOCampbeltown was #switched on# to colour television on Tuesday by the town#s new Provost, William Craig, in his first official engagement.The service has been brought to Campbeltown by Redfusion, the firm which pipes television to several thousand subscribers from its mast at Crosshill Farm.The firm#s Scottish general manager Mr Colin Payne said that Redfusion offers a public service of which they were proud.#We looked at the television problems here. There were just BBC and STV and occasionally Ulster in the town.#We said can we bring to Campbeltown the full range of colour programmes which are available where and the answer to that was #yes#.#There are now six programmes on the system. There aren#t many places in the country which can receive this.#ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOAn English steam liner which called in here for bait one day last week had full bunkers and a plentul reserve of coal in ious corners.

Over £ has already been raised and the committee intend to publish the list of subscriptions next week.A welcome break in our comparative isolation from the mainland was made at the beginning of the week when the steamer Kinloch made a special run to the upper reaches, with mail, passengers and cargo.Many merchants, not only in Campbeltown but at Carradale and the west of Arran ports, were carrying very low stocks and this run was not made a day too soon to prevent absolute scarcity of not a few necessities.Flour, for one thing, was running very short, and the new supplies got by bakers were very much-needed.Alcohol is again tipped as a likely rival to petrol. The new motor fuel is being produced by the Distillers Company Ltd and consists of a mixture of  per cent of alcohol,  per cent of benzole and  per cent of paraffin.

I was also involved in the construction of  miles of the A between Perth and Inverness in  years. These civil engineering schemes demonstrate what can be achieved when there is real political will and commitment to prioritise projects.I realise Transport Scotland has its own procedures for appointing consultants for the design processes and there are detailed environmental impact assessments to be done. It does, however, seem to me that its programming of the Rest and Be Thankful improvement is completely lacking in ambition.As a former director of roads and transport in Highland, perhaps I may be permitted to comment on the long-term solution.I would saythere are no geological features found on the other side of the glen which will cause a repeat of current problems, then the construction of a new road in ersion would cause less disruption to traffic than trying to form landslip shelters or tunnels adjacent to the existing carriageway.The main thing though is for Transport Scotland and their political masters to just get on with it.This week, Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulancemarks its eighth anniversary – after a year like no other.Throughout the coronavirus pandemic, our Helimed crews have never missed a beat maintaining our emergency helicopter air ambulance service across Scotland#s mainland and island communities. In fact we#ve enhanced our service with the launch of a new aircraft – Helimed  in Aberdeen last year – which has already had a huge impact on pre-hospital care in the Grampian, Highland and island regions.In our busiest year ever, our aircrew have endured challenging working conditions, with additional procedures and cumbersome protective and safety equipment as they go about an already dficult and stressful job.But they#re not complaining – this is what the Scottish public ask of them, to save and improve lives, wherever the need arises, and they fulfil their role with courage and pride.Our exemplary performance during this national crisis has been a tribute to how far SCAA has come in just eight years and I, for one, am immensely proud of what the SCAA team has achieved.But our operational teams are acutely aware that we are only able to provide this critical service, thanks to the continued public donations which you have maintained throughout these dficult times. So you are the real heroes in our charity.SCAA is the people#s helicopter – funded by the people of Scotland, for the people of Scotland – and our two frontline aircraft are stood by ready to help you, your family, your friends, colleagues, neighbours or anyone in your community when you most need us.As we mark our eighth birthday on May , we are asking the people of Scotland,they can, to support us into the future. Any donation, however small, to celebrate our anniversary will help to save a le – just like the numerous lives we have already saved over almost , missions.SCAA vows to continue to transform emergency care in Scotland, particularly to our rural and island communities, with your support. Thank you.As a coalition of leading providers of care and support to vulnerable children and young people, we congratulate all MSPs on their election and welcome the consensus there is between the major political parties to tackle the growing mental health crisis in our young people.We have for some time raised concerns over a potential lost generation of vulnerable children and young people, whose mental health is being impacted even further by the Covid- pandemic.There have been dramatically increased waiting times for mental health treatment during lockdown.In December , for example,  per cent of children and young people had been waiting more than a year for specialist treatment, compared with . per cent in , a truly frightening statistic.A commitment by MSPs to focus on mental health, increasing investment in support services and intervention strategies, must be a priority for this parliament, giving our young people the care and support they need, when they need it.The frightening statistics on the deteriorating mental health of many young people presents a compelling case for a radical new plan for our struggling mental health services and for a national crusade to address what is a mental health pandemic, underpinned by considerably greater resourcing.This is a crisis we can overcome, but it will require a similar energy and commitment to that demonstrated for Covid-we are to achieve this and prevent many young people giving up on their futures.At sight loss charity RNIB Scotland, we are concerned the Covid- crisis might have impacted on people who are blind and partially sighted, many of whom are older.We would like to highlight the emotional reassurance and practical help we offer during the coronavirus lockdown and its aftermath.Covid has eclipsed all other health news in the past year but  people still start to lose their sight in Scotland every week. Add to that stress over Covid and the lockdowns and there could be more people needing support and reassurance.Our Need to Talk telephone counselling service remains available in Argyll and Bute and the Western Highlands for anyone diagnosed with sight loss, as well as families, friends and carers.Losing your sight can be devastating news to take in. But our trained helpers can support you in coming to terms with your condition and finding the way forward.The uncertainty during the Covid lockdown over access to basic shopping and medication, a lack of information in accessible formats, the social isolation, the barriers to being guided because of social distancing # these have all added to and compounded the mental and emotional stress people are experiencing.But we want people with sight loss to know they are not alone and that help is available.To contact the Need to Talk service, phone the RNIB Helpline on    or email needtotalk@rnib.org.uk"},{"url":null,"title":"photograph of the week may 21 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

virtual meeting of the councilrsquos Local Review Body saw an appeal by the homeowners upheld after members said they were ldquocomfortable with the extension.The original plans to extend Nouster Cottage were, agents for the owners said, to allow an inter-generational family to live together at the property.The single-storey cottage, which had already had extensions added over the years, would have a new one and a half-storey extension including a boot room, hallway, playroom, snooker room and three bedrooms, and would add eight new rooms and two bathrooms to the three-bedroom cottage.But

only made up a third of the cottagersquos footprint.They told the review body: ldquoWe strongly refute the conclusion that this is effectively a new house in the countryside, it very clearly is not.No objections to the plans were lodged but there were letters of support for the family.The agents said that the family bought the cottageto accommodate their growing multi-generational family.They added: ldquoThe family has two young boys and also an ageing parent with a degenerative disease.ldquoTheaccommodation has been designed with the three generations of family in mind, blending the needs of young and old and so that the grandparent can live comfortably on the ground floor .The review body agreed to uphold the appeal against the decision to refuse permission for the

England.Heres what you need to know:The First Minister confirmed that Glasgow will stay in Level  lockdown.Ms Sturgeon said: \"Over the past  days, there have been extensive public health measures deployed across the city - including enhanced testing and vaccination in the areas with the highest rates of Covid, especially in G and G.She added: \"Last week, we were seeing  cases for every , of the population - thats now risen to .\"That increase will partly be due to the fact theres more testing being done, but the percentage of positive tests has also increased from .% to %.\"In summary, we dont think that we have turned the corner in Glasgow yet.\"Let me stress that were confident the major public health interventions underway will be effective, and they will bring the virus rates back under control - but they need a bit longer to do that.\"We also need a bit more time to be confident than we are now that vaccination will stop the rising case numbers today becoming severe illness and sharply rising hospital numbers a couple of weeks from now.\"So for all these reasons, I can confirm today that regrettably, Glasgow will remain in Level  for another week at this stage.\"I know, not least because I live in Glasgow myself, how unwelcome this is for iniduals and businesses - but I hope it wont be for much longer.\"Nicola Sturgeon announced that East Renfrewshire will stay in Level  despite high case numbers.The First Minister said: \"On the face of it, levels in East Renfrewshire - as a proportion of the population - are actually slightly higher than in Glasgow.\"Im acutely aware that people might therefore look at the raw data and sayGlasgow is in Level , East Renfrewshire should be there too.\"But as youve heard me say many times before, and I know this is really dficult, the situation underneath the raw data is often more complex and its the detailed analysis that we must try to base our decisions on.\"For example, while the cases per , in Glasgow and East Renfrewshire are similar, the total number of cases in East Renfrewshire - because its a smaller area, obviously - is signicantly smaller than in Glasgow.\"To illustrate that, yesterday there were actually just  new cases reported in East Renfrewshire - compared to  in Glasgow. More importantly, many more of the cases in East Renfrewshire can be traced to specic household clusters, unlike in Glasgow.\"That means that we think strong and targeted public health measures have more of a chance of stemming the rise in East Renfrewshire, without the need to use wider restrictions.\"Taking all of that into account, our judgement - and these decisions are often finely balanced - is that East Renfrewshire should stay at Level  for now, although this will be kept under close review and well continue to use enhanced public health measures.\"Nicola Sturgeon confirmed that Moray will move to Level  from midnight tonight.Ms Sturgeon said: \"Im very pleased to say that the situation has actually improved very signicantly.\"Last week, the area was reporting  new cases a week per , - thats now fallen to .\"Positivity rate in Moray has also fallen quite markedly, from .% a week ago to .% now.\"In addition, the April- iant does not seem to be as commonly present in Moray as it is in Glasgow and indeed other parts of the country.\"Im able to confirm today that Moray will now move down from Level  to Level , taking effect on midnight tonight.\"This, I know, will be welcome news for people and businesses in Moray - and its been made possible by efforts of local public health teams and the public.\"I would say though that its important to remain careful.\"Being in Level  still comes with necessary restrictions, so please stick to those and do everything you can to help Moray to enjoy more freedoms and more easing of restrictions later this summer.\"The First Minister announced travel restrictions between Scotland and three areas in England.NS: \"However, there are particularly serious outbreaks of the April- iant in three specic areas of England: Bedford, Bolton and Blackburn  Darwen.\"For that reason, from Monday, we are imposing temporary travel restrictions on travel between Scotland and those  areas.\"Soyou were planning to visit friends or relatives, or to say in those areas -

But there doesnrsquot appear to have been any rebuke for the drugs deaths crisis, their failed education record, missed hospital waiting time targets, rising child poverty rates, the exam results scandal, or failures in local policing.The next Scottish Government has an opportunity over the next five years to make amends for past failures and getting caught up in an independence campaign will only take the SNPrsquos eye off the ball once again.However, the SNP did not win a majority in the election and as a minority government will require support from other parties to pass budgets and any major reforms.The Scottish Greens will likely prop up the SNP in future policy discussions, but this will requirepolicy trade-offs infor budget support.With COP firmly in the sights of both parties as an opportunity to showcase Scotland as a leader in tackling climate change on the global stage, will the Scottish Greens be willing to lend support to independence which could risk the SNP taking its focus off meeting its emissions reduction targets of % by  ndash which it has done for the past two years in a row.They have already said they want bold action from the Scottish Government and now they are in a position to bargain for this.Read more:Indyref and a blinkered green agenda could harm Scottish farmings futureDuring Sundayrsquos Andrew Marr programme, a suggestion of next spring to hold another referendum was put to the First Minister, to which, of course, she said she was contemplating. Nicola Sturgeon hasnrsquot officially committed to a timescale, other than the first half of the next parliamentary term, but it would appear that the media is setting the ball rolling by proposing such a timeline. As much as I have criticised the SNP for pedalling talks of Indyref during a pandemic, journalists are also guilty of fuelling the debate and diminishing print space or airtime for more immediate and pressing issues.Over the past week I have been moving into my new house, which has involved many hours of deep cleaning whilst tuned in to my radio and coverage of the election.Hats off to BBC Radio Scotland team for managing to fill three daysrsquo worth of election coverage with very little to report on other than the one major news story: would the SNP gain a majority Although they covered results and reaction across the entire country, the main topic on every reportersrsquo lips was whether the SNP would have a mandate to hold another referendum. So, for every listener tuned in, we are being told that this is the discussion we need to be having, this is the headline we should all be taking away.In between googling tutorials on how to sand kitchen worktops, I checked in to the community Facebook page for my local village and was struck by the fact that none of the members were remotely engaged in discussions over the election, let alone independence. Like many other communities across the country, this village is still in the grips of a pandemic, so quite understandably, most posts and discussions revolved around Covid advice and best practice, information about the local youth club reopening, as well as a series of church services.Read more:Scottish election: Indyref cant continue to dominate the next five years mdash there are bigger issuesMembers were posting aboutfitness camps and slots which had come available for hairdressers and beauty salons.

Management consultants McKinsey and Company have even stressed that ldquoprioritising innovation today is the key to unlocking post-crisis growth.While technology has enabled us all to keep in touch and connected to colleagues, it has proven tiresome as diaries become overloaded with calls and meetings. It has become easier for people to ldquohide on video calls and contribute little, meaning welose out on the rich ideas they hold. Apprentices have also missed out as remote working means they donrsquot get to see the innovation happening around them. Thankfully, we have also seen that even the leaders of video conferencing companies are beginning to suffer from technology fatigue too. Ultimately, businesses need people and ideas to thrive. If thatrsquos not a driver to bring our teams back together in a physical setting, then I am not sure what is.Given the economic impact that the pandemic has had on businesses, and with Scotland slowly beginning to reopen again ndash quite rightly prioritising the hospitality and retail sectors which were so badly impacted ndash now is the time for the Government to do the same for office-based sectors. We need to be allowed toto the office in some way, shape or form to be able to operate collectively to restore collaboration which will result in innovation. Yes, that may end up being through a hybrid model, but being afforded the opportunity toto the office will help to lessen the impact the pandemic has had on all of us.While the business world has followed the stringent rules that Government has rightly set out to protect the nation, now that we are relaxing these somewhat, autonomy must be afforded to business leaders to make responsible decisions to shape the future of their businesses. This, alongside the rumblings moving through the market that the true impact of Brexit is yet to be felt, means we canrsquot afford to let businesses suffer from a lack of innovation any longer ndash we need to be allowed to correct our own paths. To do otherwise doesnrsquot bear thinking about.Peter Proud is CEO, Forrit"},{"url":null,"title":"medusa-whales-testicles-vultures-stomachs-week-radio","story":"But as entomologist Doctor Karim Vahed also pointed out on Nature Table on Monday evening, that is still only one per cent of the whalersquos body mass.

The result  Hyperinflation that made food unaffordable.: Secret sanction-busting base - from a Scots council houseMr Berdimuhamedov in  signed a decree giving contracts to seven ldquoforeign companies to import staples like sugar, chicken and sunflower oil to be distributed to the public.

The business, which was dissolved two months ago, officially listed a friend of Mr Rejepov as its person of signicant control or beneficial owner.: Scotlands a centre of launderingThere are virtual offices or PO Box addresses all over Scotland where hundreds of often opaquely owned shell companies are registered. Over the years The Herald has named many of them. Often the owners of the addresses have no idea who really controls the entities which they host. This business, like the related business of creating shell firms is entirely legal, but barely regulated.Autocrats and kleptocrats need such facilities to survive. A concerted effort in the UK and some other jurisdictions ndash often UK overseas territories ndash would make le very hard for Mr Berdimuhamedov and his ilk. Tens of billions have been flushed out of the former Soviet Union alone in the last three decades via British shell firms, especially Scottish ones. Despots and oligarchs also use British PR firms and British lawyers to make them look good. It is not just their money they are laundering, but their reputations too.This is usually considered a British Government problem. The Conservatives at Westminster have introduced some cautiously welcomed reforms and promise more. Critics accuse them of being half-hearted.But surely it is an ethical issue, not just a political one  Nobody is forcing Scottish people to create and host dodgy firms. Nobody is forcing Scottish lawyers or company formation agents to enable global criminality and oppression.

It was an opportunity for a whole range of small parties or independent candidates, some eccentric, some on one fringe or another, to try and have their say.These small outfits tend not have permanent HQs.

These settlers looked unhinged and highly volatile. Nowhere have I felt so threatened.Palestinians put up with this ever day of their lives.When I ed from the West Bank I wrote articles for news outlets calling on consumers to boycott Israeli and settlement products, such as Medjoul dates, as part of the global Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions campaign.A Palestinian protesterIt uses the same tactics as the South African anti-apartheid movement.There were letters of complaint but my pieces were published.In more recent years, those articles may not have seen the light of day because the Israeli government, by deliberately conflating all criticism of Israel with antisemitism, had effectively silenced it.The respected Palestinian academic Edward Said nailed it: ldquoFear of speaking out about one of the greatest injustices in modern history has hobbled, blinkered, muzzled many who know the truth and are in a position to serve it.Glasgow University professor of communications and social change Greg Philo quoted an editor who, defending his news operationrsquos attempts to portray the situation as two evenly matched sides in a war, rather than the systematic oppression of a stateless people by one of the worldrsquos most technologically advanced armies, as saying: ldquoWe wait in fear for the telephone call from the Israelis.rsquoBefore the latest Gaza onslaught, we watched the trial-by-media of Jeremy Corbyn, hounded as an anti-semite for sticking up for Palestinians.The idea that he is anti-semitic is preposterous, a monstrous slur. Yet many media outlets joined the witch-hunt lest the bullies added them to its target list.Perhaps now that Israel has razed the tower block that housed the Associated Press and Al Jazeera news agencies, the fourth estate might find the bottle to craft reports around the facts on the ground, not Israeli government spin,only to show support for their fellow journalists.:Joanna Blythman: Its not up to politicians to tell us that we cant hug our loved onesThose facts, as I see them, are as follows.The context is half a century of illegal occupation. The recent violence was provoked by Israeli troops who attacked praying Palestinians in al-Aqsa mosque with tear gas and rubber-coated steel bullets, and the escalation of expulsions of Palestinians from their homes in Sheikh Jarrah, East Jerusalem, in defiance of international law.Since then wersquove seen the usual asymmetric death toll repeat. As I write over  Palestinians have been killed, including  women and  children.  Israelis have been killed, including one child. Since , Israel has killed roughly , Palestinians, more than half of them civilians , were children.The Public International Law Centre rightly condemns the current situation in Gaza as ldquoa scene of historic and current human rights violations, and in some cases, war crimes.There is no moral equivalence here.

Professor Dawkins, a biologist who appeals to scientic fact during his regular trolling of people who profess religious faith, admits his view about what constitutes lsquosufferingrsquo is evidence-free. ldquoIt seems to me to be plausible I have no direct evidence, he tells the interviewer when pressed.Wersquoll leave aside the issue of how much an affluent white man residing in a rich country can ever fully grasp the concept of human suffering and its effects. These happy accidents of birth and the advantages they have bestowed on Mr Dawkins means he will always be inoculated from the suffering of multitudes of other humans less favoured. As a gted biologist the professor has used his advantages well in advancing our understanding of ourselves and the world we inhabit. Inexplicably though, the knowledge he has gathered about the beautul ersity of creation seems not to have increased his compassion for it, but soiled it. What he is professing amounts to eugenics: the belief that only the fittest or best-equipped among us deserve to experience quality in our lives.Here, I must declare my own interest in this issue: I have a niece with Downrsquos syndrome. Itrsquos impossible to convey in a column such as this how much hurt she would feel, knowing that another human being harboured thoughts such as these how reduced how unloved how devalued. Ciara is a young woman now and, having known only the love of a large extended family, is embarking on a journey into adulthood and a future that holds the promise of good things.She has already represented her country in ious sports and, thanks to the skills, dedication and compassion of her primary school teachersshe is living a full le. She is also contributing to the happiness of others, this being a basic requirement for peaceful co-existence on earth. Professor Dawkins in his cruel, arrogant ignorance believes she and millions of others with Downrsquos syndrome are incapable of such. And lacking any evidence he chooses to see only that which he regards as other and abnormal and that these must be feared ndash and thus destroyed. It is the philosophy of Salem.Richard DawkinsYou hesitate to sign an entreaty that might adversely affect anotherrsquos ability to earn their keep. The Donrsquot Screen Us Out petition though, leaves room for Professor Dawkins to reconsider his views and their consequences for humanitythey ever entered the mainstream. It says this: ldquoPenguin Random House publishes Richard Dawkinsrsquo books. As a company, they make it clear that they ldquocelebrate and actively promote ersity and inclusion in all its forms, including and not limited to the nine protected characteristics cited in The Equality Act  including ldquodisability. They go on to say that ldquoIt is not acceptable to make dismissive or hostile remarks about a person on any basis or to make assumptions about someonersquos lestyle, interests or abilities.You may be tempted to dismiss criticism of the professor on the basis that, as a high-profile atheist they are consistent with a view that there is no ultimate force for good and that we must simply let the dice roll as they please. lsquoMoralityrsquo being merely existential, this is a grand space to inhabit in which you can set your own boundaries on what you consider to be lsquogoodrsquo. It conveniently frees us from any moral obligation to make the world lsquobetterrsquo.:Downs children like my beautul niece Ciara are a gt ndash not a burdenYet, itrsquos not on the basis of uncertain and precarious religious faith that we must disdain Professor Dawkinsrsquo barren evaluation of humanity. None of us was born complete. We will never be the finished article. At some point in our lives we will require to be fixed and restored. On these occasions the healing can only be provided by others and rests on their willingness to give something of themselves while asking nothing in .For many, the brokenness is long-lasting or permanent and may never be healed. This will call for an extraordinary measure of unconditional devotion that resists the urge to calculate cost or predict benefits. Itrsquos perhaps the most perfect love of all, but itrsquos one which we all have the capacity to offer. Richard Dawkins possesses it too and Irsquom sad that he under-estimates his own ability to reach it.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

Except for the Range Rover, of course - the exception to every rule. This car, a x or SUV, managed to evolve from utilitarian working vehicle when it was first launched in  to the luxury carriage it is today, while never losing its off-road cool or its imperious on-road presence.And now luxury SUVs, such as the BentleyBentayga, the Lamborghini Urus andthe recently launched Aston Martin DBX, are broadening the range of luxury sector SUVs while adding a touch of sporting intent to the mix.But whether saloon or SUV, a key element of the luxury cachet is the rarity of the product, the glamour attached to the brand, along with the associated high prices these attributes bring.Affordable luxuryHowever, car leasing can make luxury cars more affordable, more attainable. Therersquos no sleight of hand here, itrsquos simply the effect of not havingto pay the full cost of the car from the startinsteadyou only pay for the period from new until the end of your lease agreement. The remainder of the value is thenrealisedby the funder when they sell it into the used car marketplace.The result is that luxury cars are more affordable than you might believe. For example,the BMW  Series Saloon costs as little as pound a month to lease, which includes VAT, road tax and delivery. For those drivers desiring luxury but wanting to reduce the environmental impact of their driving, then there is always the plug-in electric hybrid version of the  Series, which can travelin excess of miles on the electric battery alone.Intelligent Car Leasing is aleasingprovider based in Glasgow that offers professionaladvice and assistance on how to lease the latest cars, and part of a group that recently received Investors in People Platinum status.Martin Brown, Managing Director of the company, says:ldquoRather than committing a lot of capital to purchase a car, with its monthly rental payments spread over anything from  months to  months, leasing is a more affordable way to drive a luxury car. Our advisers are always helpful butdown-to-earth, andwill help answer all your questions.Choice of luxury carsUnlike car retailers, Intelligent Car Leasing is not tied to selling one brand but can offer a wide range of luxury vehicles, ranging from Maserati and Porsche to Land Rover and Tesla.Sowhether you want the additional legroom of the capacious Audi A long wheelbase, the hybrid powertrain of the Lexus luxury LC Coupe, or the fully electric zero emission Jaguar I-PACE, then all these vehicles can be sourced and ordered by Intelligent Car Leasingrsquos specialist staff.More luxury vehicles comingIf this choice of cars is not enough, then rest assured there are plenty more exciting new models arriving, including the new luxury Genesis brand. Genesis arrives in June with the promise of two models to be joined by electric-only versions later.But perhaps the most exciting prospect is the arrival of the Mercedes-Benz EQS. This car, afully-electricequivalent of the S-Class, promises to take luxury motoring to a new level.With a battery range of nearly  miles, the new EQS will be able to take you effortlessly on yourjourney to most destinations without requiring a battery top up on the way. And should you require more electricity,ultra fastcharging capability is part of the EQS package.ldquoWhether you want electric only, or a traditional saloon, we can find an affordable luxury vehicle that fully suits your requirements, adds Martin Brown.Make the change to affordable luxuryCall Intelligent Car Leasing to take luxury driving to a new level on  , orvisitwww.IntelligentCarLeasing"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-scotland-glasgow-remains-level-three---no-change-east-renfrewshire","story":"The city will be the only council area in Scotland still subject to Level Three restrictions from tomorrow, with Moray set to move into Level Two from midnight while East Renfrewshire remains at Level Two despite its case rate overtaking Glasgow.The latest data shows that seven-day incidence of the virus in East Renfrewshire had reached  per ,, compared to  per , in Glasgow.However, Nicola Sturgeon said the data indicated that infections in East Renfrewshire were being driven by \"specic household clusters\" compared to the widespread community transmission being found in the southside of Glasgow.: Covid deaths among younger Scots overtake over-s for first time in pandemicThe First Minister said extensive public health interventions including increased testing, vaccinations and enhanced contact tracing had been targeted to the worst affected parts of the city in the G and G postcodes which form the bulk of her own constituency, but this had not yet suppressed the outbreak.She said:\"Despite all of the efforts over the past  days, cases are still rising in Glasgow and we are fairly certain that the increase is being driven by the fast-spreading April- [Indian B..]iant.\"Last week, to give you some context, we were seeing  new cases for every , of the population thats now risen as of this moment in time to .\"That increase will be partly due to the factthere being more testing but the percentage of positive tests over the past week has also increased from .% to %.

We seek assurances, therefore, that  steps will be taken to ensure that this happens. Close collaboration with locally elected representatives, including the island authorities, will be important but we would encourage you and your officials to look at other ways of making sure this happens from the outset.“Needless to say, we would be happy to meet with you to discuss this matter in more detail.  Meantime, we wish you well in the substantial task that lies ahead and stand ready to assist, particularly in ensuring the needs of our islands are front and centre of government thinking.“We look forward to hearing from you in due course.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

We did a huge amount of work including introducing a one-way system, social distancing measures and putting down markers,” said theatre manager Paul Baines. “One of the biggest challenges was getting people in and out safely.“We have to ensure the measures are genuine and effective and they are visible. Visible reassurance is important for customer confidence.“It is a juggling act because you have to balance creating a too clinical atmosphere with offering a unique theatre experience.”The theatre has been awarded the VisitEngland We’re Good to Go industry standard mark, signying that it adheres to government and public health COVID- guidance, also approved by UK Theatre Seat Safety.Alongside familiar COVID- safety measures, Rosie Fraser has introduced a new service called “Silent Treatment”.“We love a good chat but we also understand some people prefer not to,” said Rosie, whose beauty salon opened in .“Clients can see the service as soon as they look at the online booking menu and add it with whatever treatments they are having.“We still carry out a full consultation and then let them just relax.”Also in place are bespoke engraved screens between stations, extra time for cleaning, screening forms for track and trace, PPE and sanitising measures. Rosie emphasises that it is safety with style!

Safety processes include a digital thermometer mounted at the door which all staff and customers are required to pass before entering. Anyone recording a high temperature is refused admission.Hand sanitisers are also available. Kitchen and front of house staff are required to wear masks and wash their hands regularly. Tables and chairs are cleaned rigorously after every diner.

Subsequent site investigation works were undertaken, and confirmed the presence of oil contamination below part of the area, which falls within the council’s ownership.However, after writing to the MoD, it was in November  that confirmation came that OIC was unsuccessful in its request that the MoD foots the bill for the clean-up operation.According to the MoD, the evidence did not support them assuming liability for the contamination.The ambition to attract new businesses and industries to Lyness, transforming and breathing new le into the area with signicant new job creation, has been held by OIC for years.Its potential and the characteristics the area boasts have been lauded by the authority for some time, but aside from interested glances and preliminary works carried out by companies, nothing has come to fruition.The last of these was in , when plans to revitalise the area into a decommissioning base to serve the oil and gas industry failed to materialise.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Scepticism had been rising on all sides over the lack of signicant movement off Mr Bidenrsquos . trillion dollarplan, or the Republicansrsquo proposed  billion dollaralternative.White House press secretary Jen Psaki said the proposal exhibits a willingness to come down in size over the final sum, as talks got under way between key cabinet secretaries and Republican senators. vw,vw,px, px\"US president Joe Biden But after the hour-long meeting, the Republicans quickly rejected the new approach as ldquowell above the range of a proposal that could win bipartisan support.The two sides ldquoseem further apart than when negotiations began, according to a statement from an aide to Republican senator Shelley Moore Capito.The White House and the Republican senators have been in talks ever since Mr Biden met with a core group of Republican negotiators over the possibility of working together on an infrastructure plan.The White House dispatched the transportation and commerce secretaries and top aides to Capitol Hill to meet with the Republicans earlier this week, and they had a follow-up video call on Friday.According to a memo obtained by The Associated Press, the administrationrsquos new approach is cutting more than  billion dollarsfrom the presidentrsquos initial offer. vw,vw,px, px\"Senator Shelley Moore Capito meets the US president But the memo makes clear Mr Biden is not interested in the Republicansrsquo idea of having consumers pay for the new investments through tolls, fuel taxes or other fees.Instead, the administration is sticking with his proposal to raise corporate taxes to pay for the new investment, which is a red line for Republicans.ldquoOur approach should ensure that corporations are paying their fair share, said the memo from the administrationrsquos negotiators to the Republican senators.But Republicans dismissed the new White House offer as ldquovery marginal movement on the top line without much dference in policy, according to a Republican insider. The new offer was ldquodisappointing, the aide said.Securing a vast infrastructure plan is Mr Bidenrsquos top priority as he seeks to make good on his campaign pledge to ldquobuild back better in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis and the economic churn from a shting economy. vw,vw,px, px\"Signicant dferences remain between the White House and Republican senators With narrow Democratic majorities in the US house and senate, the president is reaching out to Republicans for support on a potentially bipartisan approach rather than relying simply on his own party to muscle the proposal through.Republicans are adamantly opposed to Mr Bidenrsquos proposed corporate tax increase to pay for the package, refusing to undo the  tax cuts, the partyrsquos signature domestic accomplishment under Donald Trump.They reduced the corporate rate from % to %. Mr Biden proposes lting the corporate tax to %.Ms Psaki said the new proposal drops the presidentrsquos proposed expenditures on broadband as well as roads, bridges and other major investments to meet the Republicansrsquo lower level.She said the administrationrsquos proposal also involved ldquoshting investments in research and development, supply chains, manufacturing and small business out of the infrastructure talks, since they could be considered where.But Ms Psaki said the presidentrsquos team is still pushing for investments in new veterans hospitals, rail projects and green energy investments to fight climate change that Republicans have excluded from their offers.In all, the White House cut broadband from  billionto  billion dollars , as Republicans proposed. It also reduced road and bridges spending by  billion dollars , from  billion dollarsto  billion dollars , to move closer to the GOPrsquos proposal of  billion dollarsin new funds.Removing the research and development funds would cut a whopping  billion dollars , the aides said.The White House characterised the Republicansrsquo initial  billion dollar ldquoRoad map proposal as amounting to an estimated  billion dollarsto  billion dollarsin ldquonew investment, above current levels congress has traditionally funded, according to the memo.The Republican senators have not publicly disclosed their latest offer.copy -.

It acknowledges the anxiety that some travellers may have.Loganair chief commercial officer Kay Ryan said: ldquoWe are delighted to play a part in helping showcase Shetlandrsquos stunning scenery and all the great reasons to visit this beautul part of the United Kingdom.ldquoWe are also extremely mindful of our passengersrsquo well-being, and full details of our lsquoFlysafersquo healthy flying protocols are available on our website, along with our lsquoFlexprotectrsquo programme which outlines our flexible bookings conditions as we continue to transition out of travel restrictions.Shetlanders Neil and Natasha Clubb took part in the filming ndash spending the day as ldquotourists enjoying the scenery and famed islesrsquo hospitality.Mr Clubb said being involved was great fun.ldquoWersquove not told many people about it so I canrsquot wait until my friends in Glasgow see it on the TV and realise that itrsquos us,# he said.ldquoThe filming experience was really good fun.

There was a huge amount of rope and all sorts of litter.“Beyond that there was general litter such as Coke bottles, beer cans, and a few face masks. The only odd thing we found was a massive oxygen tank.”Highlighting the volume of rubbish encountered during the clean, he added: “Nearly everyone who came along was from the community and they had seen this litter building up over the last two years.“The beach clean is an annual event we tend to do in April but we had to cancel last year’s so this year is basically two years’ worth including two winter storms’ worth.”When asked how much of the responsibility for the mess he believed lay with local people, he went on to say: “Some of the litter will certainly be from local industry but so much of it will be dropped from people on the island – whether locally or swept in.“The problem is not just local to here, it’s a UK-wide issue.”Addressing the challenges facing the village more broadly, Mr Watson said: “On Friday one of our contractors pulled up two trailers of fly-tipped metal down the side of one of the bridges away from the beach.“That has been years’ worth of local people dumping bikes, climbing frames and all sorts of bits and pieces. Both the Woodland Trust and the Uig Community Trust were speaking today about how we can make a bigger impact through this event, and how we can cover the whole of the community.“There is real potential for the event to be an Uig clean as a whole and not just a beach clean.“A lot of people were saying that it was the first event that they had been to in well over a year, while some of the older people hadn’t seen anyone for months.“It was a real feel-good event from that side of things.“There was a mixture of working-age parents through to retired folks.“It was great to see the kids there and have a chat with their parents. The children were appalled at the amount of litter on the beach, and we were talking about what they can do to help. Getting the message across to them about these matters at an early stage is ideal.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Portree-View-scaled.jpg","title":"new skye homes to be sold at a fixed","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine revealed proposals by London-based developer Charlie Garton Jones to build  family homes in Portree on the site of the old golf course off the Struan Road.The plans,approved, will comprise  three-bedroom houses, and five four-bedroom houses, each with a garden and drive, situated on a site of around five acres in total.Mr Garton Jones lodged a planning application with Highland Council in late April this year, and hopes to provide homeowners with an ultrafast one gigabyte broadband connection free of charge for the first five years via the excess capacity the Bracken Hide Hotel will have from the nearby BT exchange.If given the green light, the scheme will be built on land next to where the developer is constructing his -cabin hotel, which is scheduled to open in April .Mr Garton Jones runs an independent estate agency specialising in the sale and rental of residential property in London, which has offices in Westminster, Nine Elms, Cha and Battersea.He also owns the Cow Shed boutique bunkhouse in Uig. report on Mr Garton Jones’ proposals has sparked a heated debate via the paper’s Facebook page over the last few days, attracting more than  comments.Although opinions dfered on the appearance of the houses, the main point of contention centred on whether the homes would be affordable and accessible to local people.Peter Brown commented: “The local community should have the final say. Personally I would think social housing should be a priority.”While Helen Grianan said: “Will these houses be £, or under  If not, they are not affordable housing for locals or key workers.”Calum J Morrison from North Uist was in favour of the scheme saying: “Sounds like a good type of thing in my opinion, the dude seems to know what he’s doing, good luck to him I say!”Annie B Campbell, meanwhile, highlighted broader issues with housing on the island, stating: “Key workers, like some NHS and teachers, are being outbid for most of the houses that come on the market in Skye.“They are not ‘officially’ homeless so do not have enough points to qualy for council housing.“Some are forced to skip between illegal short term lets. This is not simply a locals versus incomers issue.“Key workers coming to fill essential jobs on the island and local families need somewhere to live. There is a very real housing crisis.”Mr Garton Jones said the price of the houses could not be confirmed until planning permission was obtained.However, in the last few days, he took to social media to try to address worries that people on the island will be priced-out of buying the properties.“There has been a lot of focus on the larger family house we are hoping to build but  of the  houses we are building are smaller, three bedroom, houses,” he commented.Kevin McMahon simply asked: “Will there be a first refusal for locals and the children of local families ”In response, Mr Garton Jones said: “I am happy to confirm that the properties will not be sold via the Scottish ‘sealed bids offers over’ system but will be sold at a fixed price on a first-come, first-served basis.“Obviously until we have planning, we cannot sell the houses, but we have opened up a ‘waiting list’., which is the only place the houses have so far been mentioned or advertised – have emailed me to express their interest in the houses.“Many of them do, indeed, appear to be locals, although we will not be checking birth certicates as part of the sales process.”He added: “There are  houses in total, soyou would like your name added to the list, please email me via charlie@gartonjonesChisolm talked about his own chances of finding a home, questioned the effectiveness of the Highland Council in its current form, and underlined the importance of investing in smaller communities on the island.“I am living with my parents, and with my work I am fortunate to still live on Skye,” he said.“Saying that, I haven’t taken any steps to purchase a home as the prices do not justy the property, or are just too expensive.“I know people who have taken steps to purchase but were outbid either at the start or last minute.”Chisolm has worked for CalMac since  and says he has thought about moving to the Western Isles due to his poor prospects of finding a home on Skye.He said: “I have strong family connections to Lewis and Harris, and I might have the possibility of moving across as house prices haven’t been affected as much as on Skye in terms of second homes and holiday homes. However, it is now on the rise as on other neighbouring islands.”Chisolm believes a revamp of the local authority is needed to force meaningful change.“Skye is facing issues linked to the lack of investment and communications. That makes me question why are we governed by people in Inverness and not the people of Skye and the surrounding islands.“I look at the Western Isles, and I’m seeing housing developments across the islands in dferent areas with the goal of helping local people stay where they are from, sustaining school numbers — including Gaelic communities — and helping small areas grow.“That should be critical here and not just developing in Portree. Roads, housing, harbour investments are just a few aspects that link together and time is critical.”He added: “It’s very important for young people and young families to stay on the island with the support of affordable housing, whether that’s purchasing or renting.”Chisolm said he had been encouraged by responses to Iomairt an Eilein’s call to action.“Political responses ahead of the election have been very welcoming and we are grateful for the support,” he added. reported on plans to build a new -home private scheme on the outskirts of Portree.Commenting on the merits of the proposal, Chisolm said: “I welcome the new development in Portree, I’m sure many young people and families from Skye will benefit from thesethey are available at an affordable price.“That being said, I do question why we’re only developing in Portree. I can name many schools in surrounding communities that would benefit from even a half of a development like this.”Painting a stark picture of the dficulties facing townships such as Staffin, he said: “Smaller communities are missing out and our school numbers and Gaelic communities are suffering. This should be a wake-up call to our government and ‘our’ council that more housing investments in rural areas will have more of an impact and better outcomes.“We all have a right to articulate our viewpoints and opinions. Not everyone will agree but that’s what makes a community – having dferent voices for the benefit of our island.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3812694.jpg--.jpg?1621502297000\n","title":"church launches new youth app","story":" THE Presbyterian Church in Irelandhas sought to respond to the impact of the pandemic by supporting and developing congregational le across PCI’s -plus churches with a range of resources. The latest initiative is the brand new PCI Youth App.Rev David Thompson, Secretary to the Council for Congregational Le and Witness, explained that one of key elements of fruitful youth ministry is effective communication, which was challenging before Covid-, but has become even more so in present circumstances. The new app will allow congregations to safely and effectively keep in touch with young people, leaders and parents.”With a number of default ‘pages’, which can then be customised by congregations as their own ‘affiliate’ app, it brings everything together in one place, that is easily accessible to everyone involved in a church’s youth ministry. Congregations with less time and resources can start off with a basic template and build as their needs change, but others may want to be a little more adventurous, which makes it not just a useful tool for these times of additional challenge, but one that will continue to be useful long into the future.David Thompson explained that this makes the App very flexible, “As a Council, we were delighted to receive funding from Northern Ireland’s Education Authority to make the App freely available to  congregations and we have really been encouraged by its steady uptake by congregations. We hope that it will prove invaluable in effectively communicating not only what is happening, when and where, especially when our youth groups can’t meet in person.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3813137.jpg--.jpg?1621509111000\n","title":"moy park offer jab at work to employees","story":"Moy Park is facilitating its Northern Ireland workforce with the opportunity to receive the COVID- vaccination at work.

The trio were cared for at the centre after a number of litters were seized at the port, with puppies being taken into the care of local dog rescues across Mid-Antrim.Originally four puppies were brought to the Ballymena Rehoming Centre by authorities, and were named Neo, Asher, April and Daffy by staff there. However, after receiving an initial vet check-up, they were found to have contracted parvovirus and despite best efforts by the team to help her, April sadly passed away. Conor O’Kane, Rehoming Centre Manager at Dogs Trust Ballymena said: “When they arrived, we could tell they had been through a traumatic experience and that something was wrong. We had them immediately checked over by a vet and after it was confirmed they had parvovirus they began treatment but unfortunately nothing could be done for April. “We believe they were under the age of eight weeks which is too young to be taken away from their mum or to undertake such signicant travel. After around four weeks of treatment, Asher, Daffy and Neo received a clean bill of health during that time, they had relaxed more and really started to come out of their shells. “It wasn’t long before we were able to find them new owners prepared to give them all the love and care they need to live happy lives, despite their dficult start in le.” Paula Boyden, Veterinary Director at Dogs Trust,said: “An ongoing and very serious issue that faces dogs and potential owners is the illegal trade of puppies. Alongside other animal welfare organisations in Northern Ireland, we have been campaigning for stronger and better enforcement of dog breeding regulations. “It is important that an improved, robust licensing system is developed in Northern Ireland in order to tackle unscrupulous breeders and sellers, alongside effective inspection of licenced breeders to ensure the welfare of dogs. As well as requiring every dog breeder to be registered or licensed, these credentials should be a legal requirement on any advertising that promotes the sale of dogs.” Every year puppies are illegally imported into Great Britain and mis-sold via online ads to unsuspecting dog lovers who think they are getting a healthy, happy home-bred puppy. Dogs Trust is urging potential dog owners to follow the charity’s responsible purchasing advice when getting a puppy:  Potential owners should always call the puppy seller beforehand and should never make any payment in advance of seeing or meeting their new pet  Pitfalls can be avoiding by not rushing into purchasing a puppy and following our buyer advice so potential dog owners aren’t ‘dogfished’. Always ask to see puppy and mum together at their home, evenits via video call to comply with coronavirus restrictions. Ask lots of questions and expect to be asked lots of questions as a good breeder will want to know where the puppy is going  All puppies should be microchipped at eight weeks old and registered to the breeder as the first keeper. Potential owners should be able to check whether paperwork such as pedigree papers, microchipping, proof of vet checks and vaccinations, all match  If, for whatever reason, something doesn’t feel right or you feel pressured into buying when you see or visit them, do not proceed and report to Trading Standards  We would recommend potential owners consider adopting a rescue dog before purchasing a puppy, howeveryou are planning on purchasing a puppy, then make sure you do your homework. Dogs Trust is changing the tale for dogs like Neo, Asher and Daffy.

Photo: Kelvin BoyesJohn BreslinMay   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailThere has been no immediate flight price spike following the latest loosening of overseas travel restrictions for Northern Ireland — while those in the industry say holidaymakers are remaining cautious. There are concerns and some confusion over the test needed to be taken by those ing to Northern Ireland, with those from the green list countries told they will need a PCR test rather than the much less expensive lateral flow one for those landing back in England.There was no spike in the price of flights from Belfast to Portugal#s Algarve following the announcement the country is on the green list under the traffic light system for travel.Flights for a family of four in the first two weeks of July have remained steady at around £,, with both EasyJet and Jet. There were plenty of seats available last night on a selection of flights.Travel agents are busy fielding plenty of calls but there is no rush to book as people appear to be holding off and waiting for more choices, said Sandra Corkin, managing director of Oasis Travel in Belfast.Staff at the agency, still limited as some remain on furlough, are busy fielding calls from potential travellers this summer and  but also those who booked last year and were unable to go on their holiday.Whenever England put some countries on to the green list, people knew Northern Ireland would follow so we were taking names and details of people anxious to get away, Ms Corkin said.But it is still a far cry from normal and they are limited to where they can go so a lot of people are still waiting.Most of those actually booking are those where there are no children in the party, while many families are holding off as they will not be travelling until later in the summer.Certainly some people are determined to get away and we have picked up some business, others do not want to be stuck to Portugal.People are still interested in going to Portugal but are worried about the cost of the PCR test, up to £ per person, it’s been warned.NIDirect has all the information on required testing, a Department of Health spokesman said, adding a link to information on travelling from a green list country.You must take a Covid- PCR test on or before day two after you arrive. This must be booked prior to travel, according to the site.On another page of NIDirect related to travelling from abroad, those ing are told they can take either a PCR test of a lateral flow test,For a family of four, the need for PCR tests could add up to £ to the cost of the holiday. They can cost up to £ compared to £ for lateral flow tests.Travel agents fielding calls, particularly from families planning to travel in July or August, are confused at the dference in the rule between Northern Ireland and England.It is a question I have asked myself, why PCR here and lateral flow allowed in England, said Ms Corkin. It would make le a bit easier.Travellers arriving back from Portugal, Israel or Singapore are requested to take an additional free COVID- PCR test on day eight following their .There is hope, Ms Corkin added, for a a change in rules deeper into the summer to allow for travel without testingpeople are vaccinated.In a statement, Jet, which plans to resume flights from Belfast International to Faro on June , said that it is pleased that the Northern Ireland Executive has committed to reopening international travel this summer.” But the company added: We also call for UK-wide clarity over Amber List destinations rather than the current mixed message approach, which only causes confusion for customers.Belfast Most ReadTV doctor Christian Jessen tells Arlene Foster libel hearing he invented ping-pong story‘I lost everybody that day, even though Dee is still alive’ – Andrew McGinley on the day Deirdre Morley killed his three childrenIn pictures: Supporters at Irish Cup final between Larne and Linfield as gates reopenRoyal North of Ireland Yacht Club blamed as Ballyhalbert secretary avoids jail term over £k fraudTaylor Swt Belfast ‘sightings’ sends social media into hystericsTop VideosPlayVideo: Searching for Taylor Swt in Belfast Play#I wouldn#t rule violence off the table# LCC member tells NI Affairs CommitteePlayPrince Charles visits Co Tyrone village of CaledonLatest CoronavirusVaccine passports ‘being prepared for use by NI citizens’Murphy upbeat about a complete end to lockdowns as no new deaths recorded yesterdayCoronavirus Northern Ireland: No further deaths and  cases reportedMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Confirmed Covid cases in your area and seven day rolling averageCup of cheer... football fans can’t wait to get back into stands for showpiece finalLatest‘I fell to my knees on December , , crying to the Lord to save me’: What I Believe with Rev Dr Derek ThomasGeorge Best: the pop culture icon who was in a league of his ownGail WalkerOpinionJust like Jimmy Savile, when confronted with Martin Bashir’s wrongdoing, the BBC did nothingJon TongeOpinionUnionists face a stark choicethey are to deny SF the First MinistershipLindy McDowellOpinionBBC’s Diana duplicity is a betrayal of journalists who risk their lives in NI,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Credit: Jonathan Porter PresseyeGillian HallidayTwitterEmailMay   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailCovid vaccine passports are being prepared for Northern Ireland citizens, the Department of Health has said.The department told the Belfastyesterday that it is currently working “on a solution to enable proof of vaccination to the agreed standard”.The development comes as the Executive announced this week that international travel to allow citizens here to travel overseas will resume from Monday.Travellers and holiday makers can avail of a new traffic light system, which will enable travel to a limited number of countries in Europe and beyond.The new system categorises countries as either red, amber or green based on their coronavirus risk, with dferent rules for each.Countries on the red list have the most restrictions.A Department of Health spokesperson “anticipated that a paper based option will be available in the first instance, from a specialist printing service.This requires infrastructure to be developed, allowing citizens to request certication which is securely linking to their personal data,” they added.“Further details will follow shortly. In the meantime it should be noted that neither GP practices or other health and social care organisations are able to issue letters for travel purposes.”Further details regarding the traffic light system is available via the NIDirect website.It is understood millions of pounds, including £m in resources and £.m capital allocation, has been made available to the department for vaccination certication and a form of digital citizen ID.In the UK’s devolved nations, a format for certication letters, to enable proof of vaccination, has only been agreed in recent days. Last month Health Minister Robin Swann said vaccine passports here should be limited to international travel and large events only.Mr Swann said he would not be supportive of using vaccine certications for gaining access to hospitality providers or close-contact service businesses.The utilisation of Covid vaccine passports to access hospitality or close-contact services is not something that sits comfortably with me,” he explained.But there#s a necessity, or a possibility, for the utilisation for international travel, but not for accessing domestic services and support.”Meanwhile, the Irish government’s road map for theof international travel could be ready next week, the Republic’s Tourism Minister Catherine Martin said.It comes as Ireland’s Health Minister Stephen Donnelly said the country is hoping to sign up to the EU#s Digital Green Certicate as soon as possible.The issue is to be discussed by the Irish cabinet next week and Ms Martin said a clear plan will be crucial for the recovery of Ireland#s tourism sector.She said: I hope next week government will be providing a road map for international tourism. That is really, really critical for tourism to recover.It accounts for % of tourism revenue. I#m acutely aware of that as Minister for Tourism and also of the supports that are needed, so there#s no clf-edge for the industry.”Belfast Most ReadTV doctor Christian Jessen tells Arlene Foster libel hearing he invented ping-pong story‘I lost everybody that day, even though Dee is still alive’ – Andrew McGinley on the day Deirdre Morley killed his three childrenIn pictures: Supporters at Irish Cup final between Larne and Linfield as gates reopenRoyal North of Ireland Yacht Club blamed as Ballyhalbert secretary avoids jail term over £k fraudTaylor Swt Belfast ‘sightings’ sends social media into hystericsTop VideosPlayVideo: Searching for Taylor Swt in Belfast Play#I wouldn#t rule violence off the table# LCC member tells NI Affairs CommitteePlayPrince Charles visits Co Tyrone village of CaledonLatest CoronavirusNo travel price spike… but no big rush to get away eitherMurphy upbeat about a complete end to lockdowns as no new deaths recorded yesterdayCoronavirus Northern Ireland: No further deaths and  cases reportedMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Confirmed Covid cases in your area and seven day rolling averageCup of cheer... football fans can’t wait to get back into stands for showpiece finalLatest‘I fell to my knees on December , , crying to the Lord to save me’: What I Believe with Rev Dr Derek ThomasGeorge Best: the pop culture icon who was in a league of his ownGail WalkerOpinionJust like Jimmy Savile, when confronted with Martin Bashir’s wrongdoing, the BBC did nothingJon TongeOpinionUnionists face a stark choicethey are to deny SF the First MinistershipLindy McDowellOpinionBBC’s Diana duplicity is a betrayal of journalists who risk their lives in NI,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

This action is being taken as a precautionary measure in line with standard national guidance.”TB is a bacterial infection spread through inhaling tiny droplets from the coughs or sneezes of an infected person.It mainly affects the lungs, but it can impact on other parts of the body, including the stomach, glands, bones and nervous system.Although a serious condition, it can be curedtreated with the right antibiotics.Symptoms of TB include fever and night sweats, a persistent cough and unexplained weight loss.Dr Sarah Milligan, Acting Consultant in Health Protection, PHA, said: “TB is a serious but curable infectious disease which normally affects the lungs, but it can affect other parts of the body too. It is usually spread through the air when a patient coughs or sneezes. TB is a dficult infection to catch and usually requires prolonged close contact.”Dr Milligan continued: “I would like to reassure parents and those who attend the school that children with TB are rarely infectious to others and the risk to pupils and staff at the school is low. The screening that is being put in place is a precautionary measure.”Aileen Browne, Principal at St Matthew’s, said: “The school is cooperating with the Public Health Agency to help ensure the safety of the school community. I would encourage anyone who receives communication requesting that their child gets screened to do this.Cases of tuberculosishave dropped in Northern Ireland in recent years, according to official figures.Provisional figures for  show a total of  cases were reported. .app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Belfast Most ReadTV doctor Christian Jessen tells Arlene Foster libel hearing he invented ping-pong story‘I lost everybody that day, even though Dee is still alive’ – Andrew McGinley on the day Deirdre Morley killed his three childrenIn pictures: Supporters at Irish Cup final between Larne and Linfield as gates reopenTB case confirmed in east Belfast primary schoolRoyal North of Ireland Yacht Club blamed as Ballyhalbert secretary avoids jail term over £k fraudTop VideosPlayVideo: Searching for Taylor Swt in Belfast Play#I wouldn#t rule violence off the table# LCC member tells NI Affairs CommitteePlayPrince Charles visits Co Tyrone village of CaledonLatest HealthVaccine passports ‘being prepared for use by NI citizens’No travel price spike… but no big rush to get away eitherTele health writer honoured for work on dementia by Alzheimer’s SocietyMurphy upbeat about a complete end to lockdowns as no new deaths recorded yesterdayCoronavirus Northern Ireland: No further deaths and  cases reportedLatestGeorge Best: the pop culture icon who was in a league of his ownGail WalkerOpinionJust like Jimmy Savile, when confronted with Martin Bashir’s wrongdoing, the BBC did nothingJon TongeOpinionUnionists face a stark choicethey are to deny SF the First MinistershipLindy McDowellOpinionBBC’s Diana duplicity is a betrayal of journalists who risk their lives in NIViewpointOpinionPoll shows struggles of unionism,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Credit: Nigel McDowell Ulster UniversityMaureen ColemanTwitterEmailMay   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailCalls have been made for Ulster University to seek an apology from Lord Hall over the Panorama interview with Diana, Princess of Wales.UU awarded the former BBC director-general an honorary degree in .Lord Hall was director of news and current affairs when Diana’s headline-making interview with Martin Bashir was screened in .The corporation has come under fire from Princes William and Harry after an inquiry found it had covered up deceitful behaviour” by Bashir to secure the bombshell TV scoop.Lord Hall was bestowed with the honour for “transforming the BBC”, along with the “promotion of skills, employability and the regeneration of local communities”. Lord Dyson’s blistering report this week found that Bashir was in “serious breach” of the BBC’s producer guidelines when he faked bank statements and showed them to Diana’s brother Earl Spencer to gain access to the princess.Following the report’s release Lord Hall said he had been wrong to give Bashir the benefit of the doubt” and apologised that a BBC investigation “fell short of what was required”.As the fallout from the report continued, DUP MP Gregory Campbell said Lord Hall should be given the opportunity to issue a “mea culpa” to Ulster University, which had awarded the honorary degree in good faith.He said: “Undoubtedly it happens from time to time that people are awarded or given commendations in certain spheres and then, subsequently, an event happens that those giving the awards couldn’t and wouldn’t have known about at the time.“In this case, I think the Ulster University should write to Lord Hall and remind him of the honorary degree which they offered him and which he accepted, and invite him to come to the university to publicly apologise for his actions while he was in charge at the BBC.“Of course, Lord Hall can’t be to blame for things that happened before or after his tenure, but he oversaw the investigation at the time and cleared Bashir.He can’t deny responsibility for that.”Mr Campbell pointed out that current director-general Tim Davie had written letters to Princes William and Harry to apologise for the deceit behind the Diana interview.It is understood he also wrote to Earl Spencer, Princes Charles and the Queen.“Lord Hall has apologised, but has done so in a general sense,” Mr Campbell added.“If his successor at the BBC can write to apologise to the princes and those directly affected as a result of the BBC’s misreporting, because he’s the man who is in charge now, then Lord Hall should do something similar to the place where he was awarded his honorary degree.“The university should extend to him the opportunity to do a mea culpa.Whether that’s by letter or in person would be up to the university to decide.”Meanwhile, Boris Johnson has expressed sympathy for the royal family in the wake of the publication of Lord Dyson’s hard-hitting report.His comments came as Prince William claimed the Bashir interview had fuelled his mother’s fear, paranoia and isolation’ in the final years of her le and damaged her relationship with Prince Charles.Prince Harry went even further, saying: “The ripple effect of a culture of exploitation and unethical practices ultimately took her le.”During a visit to Portsmouth yesterday the Prime Minister said: “I can only imagine the feelings of the royal family and I hope very much that the BBC will be taking every possible step to make sure nothing like this ever happens again.”Ulster

Credit: Kelvin Boyes Press EyeStaff ReportersMay   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailTomorrow marks  days since the New Decade, New Approach deal was reached. The agreement, which restored power-sharing after three years of deadlock, included a series of commitments across a range of key areas — from health and education to legacy and culture. We check in on the progress of some of the main pledges.Politics and legacy issues, by Suzanne BreenNew Decade, New Approach pledged to increase the number of PSNI officers to , – the figure that was initially suggested when the force was created  years ago. It currently has , officers.The cost of the extra officers has been estimated at around £m.The Executive’s finances have been drained in dealing with the major health and economic impact of the pandemic. The Chief Constable has warned that the PSNI is actually moving further away from the New Decade, New Approach target.Simon Byrne has expressed his concern to Secretary of State Brandon Lewis and Justice Minister Naomi Long, asking her department for more funding.He has spoken of additional pressures around policing post-Brexit and the protocol, and of the need to ensure “we’ve got police officers available in some of those communities that clearly at the minute are most affected”.He wants extra officers to increase neighbourhood patrols, a measure that commands support from every party in Stormont. He has also warned he faces the loss of  officers because of cuts. “The real choice we face is that, at some point, there will be less detectives, less people policing the roads or less people available to respond to protests and disorder,” he warned in March.He has also said that falling PSNI numbers “impede our efforts to become a more inclusive and representative workforce”. An Audit Office report found the PSNI’s budget has fallen by £m in real terms over the past decade.The pledge in New Decade, New Approach to appoint a Veterans Commissioner was fulfilled with ex-Ulster Unionist MP Danny Kinahan, a former captain in the Blues and Royals Regiment, appointed last August. He will hold the post until at least .The agreement also saw a promise by Downing Street to introduce legislation at Westminster to implement the Stormont House Agreement reached five years earlier. It included mechanisms such as the Historical Investigations Unit , a new independent body to take forward criminal investigations into outstanding Troubles-related deaths.The Secretary of State is facing a legal challenge over the failure to act on those legacy proposals.Victims and politicians from across the political ide have also condemned the government’s plans to introduce a Troubles amnesty.Education by Mark BainNo-one ever pretended turning around the juggernaut of the education system was going to happen overnight.But what New Decade, New Approach did was set out a template for change and, despite the issues thrown into the path by Covid-, steps are being taken.NDNA bluntly said the way education is run at present — with a range of sectors and school types — is “not sustainable”. It promised a “fundamental review” as a basis for change.It stated an independent and external review would be established “with a focus on securing greater efficiency in delivery costs, raising standards, access to the curriculum for all pupils, and the prospects of moving towards a single education system.”That Independent Review of Education is due to begin in the summer. Appointments to the  are in the process of being made.It called for more support for children with special educational needs , and highlighted the need for tackling problems faced by pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds, urging for the establishment of an expert group to examine the links between persistent educational underachievement and socio-economic background.A report into educational underachievement was commissioned and is due at the end of this month.The Department has reaffirmed a commitment to a SEN framework, with £.m of funding pledged last October.An independent review into special education needs is to be held and will also look at the overall operation of the Education Authority.The deal promised more money for schools and said the Executive would “urgently resolve” the ongoing teachers’ pay dispute.In the last budget, finance did increase, but not as much as many had hoped, though there was signicant investment towards recovery from lost months of face-to-face education.As was the case with the Department of Health, the issues around the teachers’ pay dispute were quickly settled.A graduate medical school at Ulster University’s Magee Campus in Londonderry was also listed as a priority. Funding was confirmed in May  and the student recruitment process started in August. Around  students are expected to begin a four-year medical degree course in September.Some commitments were met quickly, others will take longer, but slow progress is better than no progress at all.Culture, by Gareth CrossOne of the key parts of the agreement was a solution to long standing issues regarding the Irish language, which played a part in the Assembly’s collapse in .While Sinn Fein were insistent any deal to revive the institutions must include a standalone Irish Language Act, the DUP backed away from a deal in February  after their grassroots baulked at Irish commitments contained within it.The New Decade, New Approach agreement found a solution in that it did not include an Irish Language Act, but many of the facets of an act, within a wider cultural package covering both Irish and Ulster Scots.Among the commitments were a new Office of Identity and Cultural Expression , separate commissioners for both the Irish language and Ulster Scots, a central translation hub for the public sector and simultaneous Irish and Ulster Scots translation services in the Assembly.The agreement also included the repeal of a  Act banning the use of the Irish language in courts and an increase in the number of designated days the Union flag would be flown from Government buildings.However, progress has thus far been limited, with much of the delay put down to the coronavirus pandemic.In March outgoing First Minister Arlene Foster said she hoped legislation on the wider cultural package would be introduced in the Assembly before next year’s election.However, following her toppling as DUP leader there are concerns the Irish language could once again become a pawn in Northern Ireland politics.It has been suggested by a DUP source that Sinn Fein may require firm guarantees on Irish language legislation before agreeing to support new DUP leader Edwin Poots’ choice as First Minister.There have also been suggestions the DUP might hold back Irish language legislation until the Northern Ireland Protocol is addressed, but this has been denied by the party.While Mr Poots has not directly addressed the Irish language issue, he has committed to honouring the NDNA agreement and fulfilling the outstanding commitments.Earlier this month the Assembly discussed the delay in translation services, revealing that cabling was installed in  but had never been used. Dficulty in hiring Ulster Scots interpreters was also noted.One of the few parts of NDNA implemented was the increase in flying the Union flag on designated days.Health, by Lisa SmythNo-one waiting over a year for a first outpatient appointment or inpatient treatment at the end of September  will still be on a waiting list by March . This was a key commitment included in the New Decade, New Approach document when it was published at the start of last year.However, within a matter of weeks, Northern Ireland was dealing with a pandemic and any hope that hospital waiting lists would be addressed disappeared.In fact, since September , the number of people waiting longer than one year for a hospital appointment or treatment has risen by more than ,, with a warning from the Health Minister that it could take  years to address the crisis.Elective care centres proposed in the New Decade, New Approach document, where operations such as cataract surgery are carried out, have been set up but staff have been erted away to help with the Covid- response.Promises were also made to overhaul a range of services, including treatments for stroke and breast cancer, and urgent and emergency care.While work has been carried out behind the scenes on strategies and some public consultations have happened, the pace has been affected by Covid-, so the health service has yet to see the benefit of the planned changes.Meanwhile, attempts to create a sustainable workforce have also been massively hindered by the rigours of the pandemic.There have been some attempts to increase staff levels, with funding secured to increase nursing and midwery places, but with an exhausted workforce, the threat of a % pay rise looming for health service staff and an ongoing row over doctors’ pensions, it seems the issue is far from resolved.Plans to put in place strategies to improve addiction, mental health and cancer services have also moved much more slowly than originally intended in the New Decade, New Approach document.The paper also promised that people would be able to access three cycles of IVF, but again, due to the pandemic, this service has all but ceased over the past  months, meaning another commitment has not been met.One success story, however, is the graduate entry medical school at Magee, which is due to accept its first students this year and it is hoped will make a dference the shortage of doctors in Northern Ireland.Business, by Margaret CanningThe New Decade, New Approach agreement promised much economic progress for Northern Ireland — little did we know in January  that a global pandemic would soon tear through most of its economic aspirations.But where sectors have been able to grow unhindered, one or two successes have been noted.Its target of , workers in the high-paid cyber-security sector by  is on track. With  hired over the last year, bringing the total number of jobs to ,, it is no longer just a pipe dream.The NDNA deal wanted to tackle the immediate challenges like growing the economy. But that has not been achievable due to Covid, with an % contraction in  — although .% growth is projected for .Looking back on it, the NDNA’s declaration that “Brexit had changed the economic context” is quite an understatement after nearly five months of grappling with the costs and hassles of the NI Protocol, not to mention its political fallout.The economic opportunity of the protocol is much-overlooked — perhaps a new foreword could be written to NDNA,  days on NDNA also trumpeted a “regionally balanced economy with opportunities for all”. We might make some progress towards that vision but that is down to the accidents of Covid-.The changes it has ushered with homeworking and the future opening of civil service hubs for workers in towns across Northern Ireland will present the type of economic opportunity formerly confined to Belfast.Skills were another big area of ambition and progress is being made there, too, with Microsoft and PwC among the companies setting up skills academies with the support for the Department for the Economy.They enable school leavers and graduates to train up in the right skills to apply for reasonably well-paid jobs in their business.But the aspiration to “drive the delivery of essential infrastructure projects, including York Street Interchange” is still quite far off, with the York Street plan still embroiling consultants. They are due to make their next report in autumn this year.Progress has been made in the City Deals drive for the Belfast region and Londonderry, although we have heard a lot less about the Growth Deals for Mid South West Northern Ireland and Causeway Coast and Glens.That push to bring more events like The Open has also been put forcibly on hold and a promise to review arm’sbodies — such as Invest NI — with a view to their “rationalisation” is less of a priority.Indeed, staff at Invest NI and other similar bodies have had to ersy in the pandemic into grant allocation, so perhaps it is for the best that they have not yet been “rationalised”..app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Belfast Most ReadTV doctor Christian Jessen tells Arlene Foster libel hearing he invented ping-pong storyIn pictures: Supporters at Irish Cup final between Larne and Linfield as gates reopen‘I lost everybody that day, even though Dee is still alive’ – Andrew McGinley on the day Deirdre Morley killed his three childrenTB case confirmed in east Belfast primary schoolTaylor Swt Belfast ‘sightings’ sends social media into hystericsTop VideosPlayVideo: Searching for Taylor Swt in Belfast PlayPrince Charles visits Co Tyrone village of CaledonPlay#I wouldn#t rule violence off the table# LCC member tells NI Affairs CommitteeLatest PoliticsJon TongeOpinionUnionists face a stark choicethey are to deny SF the First MinistershipCriticism has had little effect as Sinn Fein’s popularity on the increase​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Murphy upbeat about a complete end to lockdowns as no new deaths recorded yesterdayBelfastopinion poll: Northern Ireland#s changing political landscape as support for parties revealedSuzanne BreenOpinionUneasy lies the crown as new DUP leader is given a reality check​​​​​​​LatestTalented Belfast singer songwriter Susie Blue gets ready to fight for her rightsCottage with claim to fameNorthern Ireland a big draw to highfliers who want a taste of homeBattening down: the revival of lingIrish Cup reaction: Healy says Linfield were #better all over# in final win as Mulgrew reveals #wounded animal# approach,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

She didn’t know how to live without alcohol. It was used as a coping mechanism to suppress underlying trauma. But, she says, after reaching out to addiction support group Heal the Hurt , her recovery has been ‘astounding’. “Heal the Hurt has helped me to realise that childhood trauma was not my fault, to face my past and see it as the past, not my today. googletag.cmd.push “With the help of group therapy in a safe environment of discussion and no judgements I slowly started believing in myself again with the help and power of the  steps to recovery.” She adds: “I now have a new thinking process, I had to relearn a lot of things that I thought were true about me and I see now that I was sick and trying to get better.” The woman, who wished to remain anonymous to avoid destabilising her recovery, says she had to confront her own ‘selfishness’ the ‘hurt and trauma’ that was being passed on to the next generation. googletag.cmd.push Breaking the cycle of alcohol abuse was key, she says, to ensure that her children and grandchildren never know that pain. She is proud to have climbed that mountain: “Those were my wildest dreams that I thought I would never achieve and now I am with the help of Heal the Hurt. “It’s amazing for everyone, especially my children. They got their mammy back and I got to be their true, amazing mammy again and their world. “I do my best not to judge or be judged, it’s all part of my recovery.” At group sessions she now leads by example by helping others to ‘see the beauty of not being a slave to addiction - to see the beauty in the world, not the darkness.’     DEVASTATED FAMILIES HTH founder, Liam Stewart, himself a recovering addict, says the addiction charity has gone from ‘strength to strength’ despite dficulties posed by the pandemic. Numbers attending have almost doubled. Last year the NI health service recorded over . million anti-depressant prescription items at a cost of over poundm. Mr Stewart points to the amount spent on anti-depressants in Northern Ireland as evidence of the need to address a mounting mental health crisis. While anti-depressants aren’t specically categorised as addictive, abuse of other types of prescription medication locally is of great concern to the Derry man. He says: “People were forced to stay at home over the past year where they drank more than usual to cope with the stress. “Their medication seemed to increase and it’s understandable that a lot of people crossed the line and are now in addiction.” Alcohol misuse alone costs Northern Ireland as much as pound million a year, with up to pound million of this falling on an already stretched Health and Social Care sector. Despite these signicant costs, the Department of Health allocates a relatively small budget to tackling the problem - pound million for implementation of its Drugs and Alcohol strategy, and a further pound million for statutory addiction services from the mental health budget. That represents around five per cent of the budget, according to the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency . Derry and Belfast have the highest mortality rates related to alcohol mis-use in the North. Speaking candidly, Mr Stewart explains: “The depths of addiction in our very own group has claimed the lives of  people, the youngest being only  – families that are devastated forever. “Our referrals have doubled since July last year with the impact of Covid. “I believe Heal the Hurt has been a leline to many people, where there’s no appointment needed and people are made very welcome. Our service is also free of charge.” SMILES Underlining that point, another member of Heal the Hurt shared their experience with the Derry News. As a parent to three boys, he had attended with his GP and other health professionals but felt that ‘no-one understood’. He fell deeper into a hole of alcohol and drug abuse before finding the motivation to attend Heal the Hurt on the recommendation of a friend. While anxious at first, he grew more comfortable as other people recounted experiences similar to his own. “I decided to give the programme a go, today I am in recovery. “I never thought I could imagine a le without drink and drugs, yet here I am today, focussing on what’s really important, understanding it’s all about giving back, it’s about my boys and family.” He concludes: “My actions today are having an impact on my three boys and family. I used to bring only tears to my family, now today, I bring smiles. “Is it hard  Of course it is, it’s tough, but looking at my children and family smiling now is what’s important. “This makes me hungry for more of this programme and more of Heal the Hurt.” Meetings are currently held in a small room at the back of Northside Shopping Centre in Galliagh. Since it was established, Heal the Hurt’s path has not been straightforward, it has faced the threat of closure on more than one occasion. However, Mr Stewart expressed his gratitude to the local community for their ‘generous donations’ which have allowed the doors to remain open.  Group member, Brandon McManus , is the latest to kindly donate pound. “These people are saving lives and reuniting families. That’s priceless,” Mr Stewart says. Special mention was given to the Friars of Renewal for their input over the past five years, particularly Brother Patrick, who Mr Stewart described as one of his best friends. Brother Patrick is now living in New York where he is continuing to help people with addiction.

He waves a cursory greeting and continues on his way. In the time it takes me to gather everything I need together, he passes me again, his step count no doubt rising with every lap of the town. Zoom. Walk. Laptop. Bake. Netflix. Repetition has become endemic over the last year, but its something Moneymore cant be accused of. There is a unique feel to the fronts of the buildings that greet me as I walk around the town. Even the post office, now boarded up, remains unbranded. googletag.cmd.push Moneymores terrain gives the town a layered effect. The pillared entrance of The Manor House provides the backdrop to the towns mini roundabout, welcoming motorists coming down the hill from Smith Street. Rusty scaffolding frames a construction site on my left as I make my way down. A woman waters potted plants in her compact front garden. The distinctive smell of curry is emanating from the two Chinese restaurants at the bottom of the hill. Shutters are down on Antonios pizza, yet to open for the day. More scaffolding sits alongside buildings in mid-construction off High Street, but no work appears to be going on today. googletag.cmd.push Along Lawford Street there are ersion signs in place as Council staff busy themselves in resurfacing the Turnaface Road. The grating sound of the road roller echoes off the houses that line the street leading back to the town centre. You could describe Moneymore as ornate. Older, unique buildings, set at dferent levels, create a layered backdrop, crowned by the spire of St John and St Treas church on the top of the hill.  The hum of a small aircraft passing overhead and the unmistakable smell of freshly-cut grass adds to the sense of a town taking new-found pleasure in the mundane.     A pregnant sky threatens rain. Taken a dip I nip into The Mane Barber Shop, where a neon sign declares the shop open for business. Owner Pauline McGarvey is at her lunch. She says reopening has not been the silver bullet the industry was hoping for. “This week has been terrible. For the first seven days [after reopening] it was great, but its taken a dip again,” she tells me. “The older folk that keep you going – your pensioners and farmers and that during the day – they havent been about the same. A vintage tractor model welcomes visitors to the town from the Tyrone side. “It was a gamble coming into a small town. You do have a bit of passing trade but youre hoping people are going to come in from the likes of Coagh, Lissan and Loup. “I said I would give it six months and see how it turns. Its fine, but its not busy. You have that fear of whether its going to come back.” Pauline has been in Moneymore three years, and until the pandemic ruthlessly attacked all businesses, things had been going well.  has seen a seismic change across all industries, driving many hair and beauty professionals off the high street altogether. “Lots of people are working from home and I have to admit, Im tempted,” she says. “Youre still going to be hit with rates, and you havent stopped paying your water bill, your electricity, your rent. “Yes, we got a bit of help, butyouve no customers in, then that money is all going to go and you still have to find wages too. “Ive seen a lot of hair and beauty people who havent gone back from the first lockdown.” Humanity adapts though, and over the last year, Pauline has embraced the situation in which the world found itself. She got married in February, and has enjoyed the extra time with her family. Keeping an eye on litter in the area. “It was the first time in my le I could actually say I was a mummy. I loved spending time with the weans,” she says. “It felt like wed a whole  years wrapped into one year. It is nice getting back though, you need the routine. Its bittersweet in a way.” Cookstown native Pauline says lockdown has really hit young people in the area hard. Her daughter, Danielle, is in Year , her entire GCSE years undertaken amid a worldwide health crisis. “Even she says she could do with another year at school,” she says. “Theyve missed a full year of preparation for the next step. Theyve been living alone in their bedroom. No formal, nothing. They werent even in school to plan it.” Its a quiet day in the barber shop, on what would normally be a busy Friday afternoon, with people popping in ahead of their weekend plans. There would have been excited chatter, the buzz of anticipation. Last minute changes of plan. Maybe even a wee drink. A look at her schedule confirms a gap of a few hours until Paulines next appointment. Without that steady flow of customers, the day can be long, lonely even. Welcome to Moneymore. Company is a two way street, and the dynamic of conversation, service and industry has been greatly missed by both barber and customer. “Even the most bald man that I have is in here every week,” says Pauline. “Two seconds would do it, but you would stretch it out to ten or  minutes, just because he likes coming in for the company. “Sometimes its just nice to get sitting down and get it done for you. Even though I have good faithful customers, I was nervous and jittery the first day back. “The amount of people who are saying its great to see you back, it gives you that wee glow. It would be nice to see a boom in Moneymore again. “I dont think anybody is going to feel anything dferent. Were all just going with the flow and trying not to stress and worry. “I think youre just going to have to wipe this year out the same as last year.”  The indicators that marked the early, panic-stricken days of the pandemic – the empty streets, closed schools, empty supermarket shelves – have long faded into memory. Only the window dressing remains. Sanitisers at shop doors. Face masks in shops. The odd discarded rubber glove on the street. All three car dealerships on the Magherafelt Road are dotted with customers as I drive past on the way home. The petrol station forecourt is hiving with people. By next Monday, theof indoor hospitality will mark another signicant step on the road to recovery. On the way out of the town, I spot a familiar cowboy hat bobbing up and down at the road side. A man enjoying his rediscovered freedom on the fringes of the Sperrins.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The seven-acre site at Bay Road faces onto the River Foyle. The site has long been used as a fuel depot. However, last year a large number of people put their name to a petition objecting to a bid for a coal screening operation on the site. The site has now been placed on the market. Although zoned as ‘white land’ the fuel yard could have development potential, particularly with the progress on the nearby Fort George site. The Department for Communities decision to sell part of the site to the Western Trust in March marked the latest step in the ambitious project. googletag.cmd.push The land on the river front of the Bay Road coal yard was also recently acquired for the new cross border cycle network, which will include a new pedestrian and cycle bridge across the Pennyburn Inlet.

The site benefits from  large warehouses, office building and a large covered storage area. “It has roughly  m of frontage on-to the River Foyle and this could be extended up the Pennyburn Inlet by around m.” googletag.cmd.push  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Derry News has learned that Home Bargains is keen on opening a new outlet on the large Waterside site. The Lisnagelvin Leisure Centre site was put up for sale last year by its owners Derry City and Strabane District Council with an asking price of pound,. It is understood that there was strong interest in the site from potential buyers. However, the council has confirmed that a preferred bidder has been approved by the councils Business and Culture Committee. That decision will now need to be ratied at the councils full monthly meeting later this month before the final details of the sale can be processed. googletag.cmd.push While all those involved in the sale of the key Waterside site are remaining tight-lipped, the Derry News understands that the preferred bidder would see Home Bargains opening a new store on the site. This would involve the demolition of the former leisure centre building and the construction of the new store. The Derry News contacted Home Bargains, who already have a store at Strand Road in Derry, about their plans for further expansion in the city. However, a spokesperson for the company said they were not able to comment at this time. A spokesperson for the local council said a report was brought before the Business and Culture Committee last week in confidential business seeking members approval for the appointment of the preferred bidder for the purchase and development of the Lisnagelvin site. googletag.cmd.push “This decision will come before Full Council for full ratication at the end of the month,” the spokesperson said. “Once ratied Councils legal services team will engage with the successful bidder to commence legal formalities for the disposal and development of the site in accordance with the Conditions of Sale set out in the tender documents.” ​Lisnagelvin Leisure Centre closed several years ago. The leisure centre was hugely popular with generations of young people in the city, especially because of its swimming pool and its famous wave machine. Since being closed, the building has been empty and there has been much debate about the future use of the large site.      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Kick off :pm. Ruaidhri Higgins has had to plan without both players with both serving a one-game suspension with striker Parkhouse receiving his fth yellow card at Shamrock Rovers last week, while Lafferty was sent off at Tallaght. City’s away form has improved considerably in the short time with Higgins in charge, with City picking up seven points from Sligo Rovers, Bohemians and Rovers. They now face a Waterford side who have been badly affected by Covid- in recent weeks, playing a reserve side in a - drubbing against Drogheda United, before being unable to field against Sligo Rovers. Waterford are currently bottom of the Premier Division, but Higgins is expecting a stern challenge. googletag.cmd.push “They have had a good period of not playing any games so they will be well rested and they have had a lot of time to prepare for this game,” he said. “They’ll be nice and fresh for this game and they will have had a lot of time to analyse us and analyse our strengths and weaknesses. There is a new manager coming in as well so you would expect a reaction from the players.” City though are confident after holding the champions to a - draw last week, a game they could well have won but for a very controversial equaliser to stand. googletag.cmd.push “Our away form has been very, very good against three of the top teams in the country we’ve taken seven points so it just shows that there are strong characters in this group and good players as well,” Higgins said. “We’ve set a standard on Saturday and we have to maintain that. We have to follow up on the performance against Shamrock Rovers and back it up with another good performance. Disappointed Meanwhile, Derry City fans hoping to attend this Monday’s game against St. Patrick’s Athletic have been left disappointed. The club released a statement yesterday explaining that despite recent changes by the Northern Ireland Executive, it was still too soon to allow supporters back into the Brandywell.     “Based on the current high rates of covid- transmission in the city, the Medical Director at the PHA has recommended that supporters should not be permitted to attend at this time,” it read. “In the interest of the health and safety of supporters, players and staff it has been agreed therefore that Monday nights match should remain behind closed doors. “We will continue to discuss a way forward with the relevant public authorities and will keep supporters informed of progress.” The club have also confirmed that Manchester City youngster Joe Hodge will not be ing to the club following an injury.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

City were completely dominant in the first half, but it was a dferent story in the second half, although Waterford ultimately lacked the quality to take any of the half chances which came their way. It took just three minutes for Derry City to take the lead, doing so with their first attack. Goalkeeper Brian Murphy needlessly raced from his area and fouled James Akintunde in the corner, gting the visitors a free kick. Patching delivered the ball into the near post where Boyce rose to head in the opening goal from close range. googletag.cmd.push The Candystripes dominated the opening stages of the game and it should have been - on  minutes when Patching ran at the Waterford defence before curling an effort at goal which Murphy could only parry straight into the path of Akintunde. The forward opted not to shoot first time however, trying to take it around the goalkeeper, but Murphy did enough to turn Akintunde away from the goal and the chance was gone. It took Waterford  minutes before they tested Nathan Gartside at the other end, and it was a big moment in the first half as the Derry goalkeeper was at his best to keep out Shane Grfin’s free kick from  yards.

City did not enjoy anywhere near the same dominance in the second half, as Waterford played a high pressing game, which made the players in red and white very uncomfortable. They were very early caught out by a Mascell free kick on  minutes, as John Martin crept free to the back post, but he was unable to bring the ball under control and the chance was again gone.

And in Division  North, any win is a golden nugget.Derry suffocated the le out of Longford and the game was over long before Jerome Henry sounded his final whistle. But on planet Derry, it was a brilliant start against the ultimate bogey team. And cast the mind back to Celtic Park last year and a mixture of emotions. A dropped point in a home draw with Leitrim in the first game, with the relief both werent dropped.Fermanaghs win over Cavan was totally dferent. The sides were level  times in an arm wrestle.  googletag.cmd.push   Much was made of the loss of the Jones, Corrigan and Cullen brothers, but Sean Quigleys exhibition of kicking points was a joy to watch. And there was a steeliness about them to back it up.For much of the game, Fermanagh were living on scraps. Ciaran Corrigans shot early on was from the sideline. Quigley was kept outside the attacking hot spot. But the one beauty he notched came after Corrigans diagonal ball unlocked Cavan. But, only lively debutant Conor Love, after he took a pass on the loop, curled over from a comfortable range.Their first-half was the story of Johnny Cassidy and James McMahon. Cassidy wore number three, but weaved much of his attacking magic from the wing, with Kane Connor back at full back. Cassidys runs were on a par with what we have come to expect from Brendan Rogers.  googletag.cmd.push   McMahon was calmness personied on the ball. But another key was how Fermanagh defended. Two balls were won by Martin Reilly in the danger zone. Apart from that, the blue jerseys were shepherded to the wings.When Cavan went down to  men, Chris Snow began to work his kick-outs to find the extra man.In the second half, Fermanagh had a greater cutting edgeabout them. James McMahon ghosted in to win a close-range free, Darragh McGurn plucked a ball from the clouds before swinging over the bar and then there was Sean Quigleys pass. It took out the entire Cavan defence before Eoin Donnellys goal chance pinged off the post and Cavan went up the field to level the game.         Fermanagh lost Corrigan for the last ten minutes to the sin-bin. They didnt flinch. Tiarnan Bogue made an inspirational fetch at midfield. Substitute Richard OCallaghan got hands on a vital ball in the melting pot, as did Corrigan when he came back on. You cant buy desire.Ryan McMenamin has made one change for Saturdays game, with Ryan Breen coming in at corner-back for Cian McManus who was replaced in the first-half last week.Derry are unchanged, as they try to lay the foundations of a team that are going to stick together.From watching both games last week, they played the same brand of football. A trimmer version of Sean Quigley was back around midfield when Fermanagh pulled everyone back without the ball.Derry did the same in Longford, with a wave of men flowing back and forward, depending on the phase of the game.Are Rory Gallagher and Ryan McMenamin defensive managers  Theyre no dferent than anyone  playing the game at the minute. Welcome to football as it is.Longford goalkeeper Paddy Collum wasnt allowed to work any short kick-outs, as Derry pushed tight. It was the packed middle third where they made hay. Their desire to win the ball was evident anytime they lost primary possession.On the one occasion that Longfords Rian Brady got more than a metre of space, Gareth McKinless picked his pocket before he could pull the trigger.Looking for holes in a comfortable -point win, youd have to look at a lack of composure in a first-half where Derry shouldve buried Longford. But kicking points in a monsoon is far from simple.Saturday will be a step up in every way. Fermanagh are not Longford. The desire they showed against Cavan was an embodiment of McMenamin himself in his pomp.While there are subplots, the Gallagher family ties, Rory and Ricey, a former Derry coach and Director of Football plotting the Oakleaf downfall, the real story of Saturday will be the battle inside the white lines. And it will be a battle.Fermanagh always relish playing Derry. The  MacRory Cup Final. The semi-final a few years back when Dom Corrigan hustled Maghera before his unleashed a footballing masterclass in the final. The Derry minor team tipped for an All-Ireland, dumped out by Fermanagh at Celtic Park. There was Barry Owens winning goal at Omagh in .Derry must force Sean Quigley to places on the wing where he doesnt want to go and have him limited to pot shots. Some will still fly over the bar, but keeping him out of the centre is a must. His pass to Donnelly was a warning shot Derry needed.It could be a job for Gareth McKinless to keep tabs on himhe plays away from the square, leaving Chrissy McKaigue on Tiarnan Bogue and Rogers inside on Darragh McGurn.Then you have the midfield hub and Glass going up against Eoin Donnelly, with the chance to put in back to back performances. Thats the consistency factor across the board Derry are craving for.A glance at Kerrys pummelling of Galway, pointed to the value of the link man. Yes, the Clfords and Killian Spillane were awesome, but Dara Moynihan was David Morans outlet to pull Galways defence out of their shape.In terms of Saturday, thats where Ethan Doherty, Josh Largo-Ellis, Ciaran McFaul and Ciaran Corrigan fit into another key battleground.Before the Longford game, Rory Gallagher spoke of Derrys need to develop a winning habit, grabbing victory in games that matter. Relegation battles. Promotion showdowns. Games like this one.Winning in Longford was a start. Before a ball was kicked, I feltDerry took two points out of Pearse Park, theyd get promoted. Looking back, it was an emotive enough statement.Watching Fermanagh win those last three dirty balls to beat Cavan tell me a dferent story. Saturday is the biggie, a game where youneed to find a way to win. By any means necessary.Having winning minor teams and a conveyor belt is all well and good. Grit is way more important in the battle for the next golden nugget.Roll on Saturday.ALSO READ - Derry and Fermanagh teams named.

That was the last we heard from him.ldquoI was listening to the news all afternoon to hearthere was anything happening. It wasnrsquot until pm that night when I was listening to the RTE news that I heard a priest had been shot in Ballymurphy.Mr Mullan knew in his gut that it was his brother, but could not bring himself to tell his parents, John and Mary.ldquoAll that was said that he was shot, it didnrsquot say he was dead. He was actually dead within  minutes of being shot, he continued.ldquoWe were phoned around am and I found out he was dead. I called the doctor just in case my mother would get badly upset and she was badly upset after the doctor told her. I couldnrsquot bring myself to tell her.ldquoMy father was up the stairs and couldnrsquot come down the stairs but he knew it was bad news.Mr Mullan said it took the Ballymurphy families a few years to organise in order to campaign for truth and justice as a  inquest recorded an open verdict in all the deaths.He has been involved with the campaign for a new inquest for over  years, travelling to Dublin and Brussels and beyond on order to plead the familiesrsquo case.Mr Mullan, his niece Geraldine McGrattan and son Hugh had been regular attenders over the  days the inquest was held.The family, including Mr Mullanrsquos late sister Teresa, lived for a time on the Strand, beside the Portaferry Hotel.While Mr Mulllan took after his father and spent his working le fishing, Fr Mullan spent a year in the Merchant Navy before opting to go to Queenrsquos University and then Maynooth College to train to be a priest.He served for a time at St Josephrsquos Church in Killough before moving to Dunloy for nine years. While his funeral was held in Belfast, he was buried in St Patrickrsquos graveyard in Portaferry.ldquoHugh baptised all my family, he married me and my we Mary, so he was very close to us all, said Mr Mullan.He recalled how his brother loved to sail in Strangford Lough and entertain his family or parishioners by singing along to his guitar.But most of all, Mr Mullan mourns what his brother could have done for others.ldquoHugh was the type of priest who needed to be among people all the time, helping people, he said.ldquoHe was someone who would have given anyone anything he had, even his last penny. He particularly liked to help young people and loved working and encouraging them.ldquoIf he had have got a chance in Ballymurphy, he would have helped the people no end to help themselves.

This means that plastic litter in the sea is just adding up and, globally, we are adding a truck load full every minute, she continued.ldquoThat is a lot of plastic and, on top of looking bad, it is harmful to sea plants and animals. Every year, plastic kills , sea animals and over a million sea birds. It is a big problem.During last weekrsquos launch event in Ardglass, a number of fishermen told Jenny how sad they were to see how much litter is in the sea and that they have noticed an increase in the amount of it in during their letimes.ldquoIt also takes their valuable time at sea to clear from their nets and can potentially contaminate their catch, so the new scheme is a win-win for them to do their part in getting rid of it.Describing the new project as ldquoinnovative, Jenny said it has already been successful where with fishermen bringing marine litter caught in their nets back to shore.She said the Harbour Authority provides durable bags for the litter to be collected in and that once landed onshore, it is sent off to be recycled or otherwise disposed of.ldquoThis is how our fishermen in Northern Ireland are reducing the marine plastic problem at sea, Jenny explained. ldquoThe thing that makes this project so unique is that fishermen are almost the only people who have access to litter that is out in the open water or at the seabed.ldquoStopping waste entering the sea is imperative, but taking litter out of the sea is too, even though it is more challenging. That is exactly what lsquofishing for litterrsquo fishermen do.Jenny praised the fishermen in Ardglass who have signed up to the scheme as did local councillor, Dermot Curran.ldquoThis is a great scheme and anything which can help reduce the amount of marine litter being washed ashore is to be welcomed, he said.ldquoTen Ardglass skippers have already signed up for the scheme and I hope that there will be more. This is a great new initiative but we also have to look at how litter gets into the sea in the first place which poses problems for trawler skippers as this waste gets tangled up in their nest which is time-consuming and a distraction they could well do without, he said.ldquoThe Fishery Harbour Authority is to be congratulated for bringing this initiative to the Co Down ports and the more skippers that sign up for lsquofishing for litterrsquo the better. The scheme can help protect the environment and reduce the amount of unsightly litter being washed up along the shoreline..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/19May2021-Business.jpg","title":"Business support programme helps secure 78 jobs in district  ","story":"A COUNCIL-LED local business support programme has created  jobs in the last  months.According to new figures released, the Business Growth and Tender for Growth programmes facilitated by Newry, Mourne and Down District Council have helped to create an average of one new job each week.The programmes are part-funded by Invest Northern Ireland and the European Regional Development Fund under the Investment for Growth  Jobs Northern Irelandprogramme.Despite the impact of recent lockdowns over the last  months, NMD Business has continued to provide SMEs with support packages in response to challenges created by the pandemic.This has resulted in ongoing growth for the business and the creation of  new job roles, as well as helping  businesses involved in the programme to navigate an unprecedented economic environment.Participants in the programme are able to avail of one-to-one mentoring from leading experts, who help guide them and their business through unprecedented times, as well as learning new skills in financial management, cross-border sales and maximising your chances of winning tenders.As a result, many businesses have been able to not only grow their business, but grow their workforce.Sara Velasquez, from Ecoplastic in Downpatrick, completed the programme last year and has already recruited four new staff for the business.Her firm designs and makes all kinds of structures from % recycled material, from boardwalks to street furniture, bridges to bike trails and picnic tables.She said: ldquoThe NMD Business programme helped us focus on the most lucrative areas for growth for our business.ldquoOur dedicated mentor provided us with expert guidance which allowed us to respond quickly to a new market environment, giving us confidence that decisions we were taking were anchored in good commercial sense, while the workshops equipped us with new skills that will stand us in good stead into the future.ldquoSales have since increased as a result and we continue to work on exciting projects across Ireland and the UK.

It was a four-lap course which started at Greenisland Golf Club and carried on via Monkstown Wood, Shore Road and then a bit of a challenge with a hill to contend with on Station Road.The weather was grey with a little drizzle but nothing to cause major problems and in fact Declan felt that there was a slight wind assistance on the climb which was welcome.The overall winner Chris Denton, was the only runner to break three hours and he took top spot on the podium with a time of two hours and  minutes.Declan was more than happy with his own time of . and the fact that he placed seventh overall.

This is especially true of local access to emergency care.Mr Hazzard said many were acutely aware that the Department of Health will soon launch a review of urgent and emergency care, suggesting that given the soundings to date from both health minister Robin Swann and the South Eastern Trust, there will be concern across the community that this will have ldquomajor ramications for the delivery of emergency medicine in small rural hospitals like the Downe.ldquoWith this in mind, it is vital that our local community and health workers are afforded an opportunity to be proactively involved in determining the most appropriate model of healthcare at the Downe, the MP declared.ldquoI was encouraged to hear the health trust recognise that communication and dialogue need to improve in the time ahead and that elected representatives, trade unions and community health activists can play a constructive role in partnership with officials in delivering for the Downe.Mr Hazzard said this would not only enable the local community to benefit from regular public engagement and consultation but, perhaps most importantly, would ensure a real andmeaningful process of co-design with staff and their trade union representatives.He added: ldquoI look forward to hearing back from the South Eastern Trust in the weeks ahead as to how this partnership forum can be established and will once again endeavour to work in partnership with all local political parties, staff representatives, and the Down Community Health Committee.News of the proposal for the establishment of the new health forum involving the public and health workers comes after Newry, Mourne and Down Council agreed to involve local health campaigners in a a major new offensive to ensure that the Downpatrick hospital continues to deliver key services.In April, politicians paved the way for the Down Community Heath Committee to join them in key discussions about the future of the Downpatrick hospital which they say has a critical role to play in delivering key services for people across the South Eastern Trust area in a post-Covid world..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/19May2021-Hurlers.jpg","title":"Hurlers rally to win over Carlow  ","story":"DOWN hurlers showed they still have plenty to fight for after they secured a rallying comeback win inspired by their talisman Paul Sheehan against Carlow.Following last weekendrsquos defeat to Kerry, Ronan Sheehanrsquos men knew they had to put on a show at Ballycran in order to avoid an early indication of relegation.The contest was worthy of a crowd, as the action-packed affair exploded from the first whistle when Carlowrsquos Kevin McDonald put his side a goal up within the opening minute.The away side piled on relentless pressure to inflict further damage on the Down side as the points gap began to widen.However, as per the usual story, star man Sheehan began picking up the pieces and alongside Caolan Taggart and Daithi Sands, Down began to let Carlow know they werenrsquot here to just fill up the numbers.The away team lost their goal advantage on the half-hour mark when the ever dangerous Conor Woods cracked home a thumping penalty to tie the scores.Sheehan ensured Down entered the half-time break on top, scoring three points in two minutes to help his side lead -

There will also be increased emphasis on ensuring that public toilets meet the needs of those with autism, dementia and other health conditions.The new toilet strategy mdash which includes a review of how council-owned toilets are managed, cleaned and maintained mdash is expected to be formally signed off at tonightrsquos meeting of the local authorityrsquos Neighbourhood Services Committee.Across the district, the local authority is responsible for  public conveniences, many of which have been in place for over  years and are showing signs of corrosion and internal wear and tear. A number have also been vandalised.Councillors will be told tonight that a decision is required to repair, replace or remove these particular units and they will be provided with a detailed breakdown of the work that is required.Toilets at Castlewellanrsquos Upper Square need to be replaced while the outer shell of the building would remain in place, while the existing facility at Market Street in Downpatrick would be entirely replaced.The new strategy suggests that the current public toilets at The Rocks in Ballyhornan would be replaced as would existing toilets at the local authority-owned car park at the Newcastle Road outside Dundrum.Plans have also been drawn up to replace toilets at Crossgarrsquos Lislea Drive and at Ardglass harbour, while public toilets at the New Line in Saintfield mdash which have been repeatedly targeted by vandals mdash would replaced, alongside those at the Quoile Road in Downpatrick.Public toilets the Lough Inch cemetery in Ballynahinch and Struell Cemetery in Downpatrick are also in line for refurbishment under the new council strategy, alongside conveniences at Windmill Street in Ballynahinch.It will also be confirmed at tonightrsquos council meeting that almost  people responded to a -week consultation on the new strategy with over  percent of those who responded agreeing with the suggestion to pay to spend a penny. Concern was also expressed about the cleanliness of some public toilets and their layout.And while council toilets in Newcastle, Dundrum, Castlewellan, Downpatrick, Ballyhornan and Ardglass have reopened after being closed due to coronavirus, those in Saintfield, Ballynahinch, Crossgar and Killyleagh remain closed. They are due to reopen shortly.Cllr Billy Walker has welcomed the decision to reopen council toilets across the Rowallane area and said the fact that these particular public conveniences have been closed or over a year was ldquounacceptable.He said steps should have been taken earlier to ensure that staff were available to open and maintain the ious facilities.Cllr Walker was particularly critical of the decision to keep toilets in Killyleagh closed given the number of people who visited the town over recent months as Covid restrictions eased.ldquoPublic toilets across the Rowallane area were closed too long for my liking and I am aware that there was concern that conveniences at the townrsquos Market House and nearby community centre were also closed, he continued.ldquoI have been informed that all public toilets across the district will be reopened by June and that is welcome news.

It is celebrated on Sunday, May .In their joint message, the bishops opened by quoting a verse from the book of Acts in the Bible: \"All of them were filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other languages, as the Spirit gave them ability - Acts :.\"They continued: \"One of the great marks of the first Pentecost was the ability the Holy Spirit gave the apostles to speak across barriers of language of the works of God.ldquoThe Spirit today gives the people of God the same ability to speak as one across all kinds of barriers and boundaries.ldquoWe rejoice today that we can speak together to both our church communities and beyond with a common message of hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ.\"Stating their disappointment that for a second year they are unable to mark this \"great feast\" by coming together for their Ecumenical Service of Prayer, as they have done for almost  years, the bishops added: \"This service allows us to give thanks and praise together to God the Father, Son and Holy Spirit. Please God, next year this might again be possible.\"They continued their message by noting how speaking together about \"the goodness of God\" across barriers is an \"important expression of the language of hope\".They said: \"This is so important as we begin the journey of recovery from the impact of coronavirus. There has been much suffering the loss of loved ones, illness, financial challenge and isolation.ldquoWe all need to hear the healing and strengthening words of Christ, lsquoCome unto me all who are weary and heavy-laden, and I will give you restrsquo.\"Outlining how during the pandemic people quickly realised how important communication is when denied simple non-verbal qualities of close contact and touch, the bishops said: \"We discovered how much we need the warmth of the love of our family and friends.ldquoThe telephone and internet became our key means of keeping in touch and we thank God for these technological aids that kept us connected.ldquoCrucially, we learned how much we are indebted to medical staff, nurses, key workers and volunteers who have communicated dedication, care and love to the community through their skill and acts of kindness.\"We must continue to communicate the language of love and hope across all barriers and boundaries.ldquoIt would be so easy after this long period of restrictions to move to despair and lose hope. Yet we believe there are signs of new le all around us in the vaccination programme and the good response to public health guidance.ldquoLet us encourage one another to communicate the hope that by Godrsquos help, our common le will slowly , and together seek his grace to renew our lives.\"In closing, the bishops said: \"We pray that the Holy Spirit of Pentecost may inspire us so that we communicate in our words and deeds the hope we have in God.ldquoMay we as Christian people speak of our belief in the transforming power of God, and by his Spirit to work together for the rebuilding and re-energising of our churches and society.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The publication of a report by Lord Dyson into the circumstances surrounding the BBC’s securing of a Panorama interview with Diana, Princess of Wales, in  isn’t just devastating about the reporter concerned, Martin Bashir.More signicantly, the report also concludes that the public service broadcaster went out of its way to conceal the truth from the public about how Bashir faked the documents that induced Earl Spencer to introduce him to his sister, Diana.    \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

It’s clear that the BBC’s failure to come clean about what Mr Bashir did is every bit as serious as the deception carried out by the reporter. The BBC has long been under pressure in relation to the cost of its licence fee and the report from Lord Dyson will further damage the public’s trust in the broadcaster. Prince William’s public statement made for emotionally charged viewing. The BBC not only let him and his family down, but also the public. The BBC must start an overhaul of its processes, with the mooted appointment of a new editorial board to deal with complaints about its programmes an important first step. It faces an uphill task to restore public trust.   \"       \"  Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up  Most PopularPeter Robinson: A purge of the DUP by supporters of Edwin Poots would be a monumental mistakeLCC chairman condemns ‘vilication’ of nineteen-year-old loyalist Joel Keys after he appears before MPs on NI ProtocolState files ‘suggest taoiseach collusion’ in IRA cover-up, says victims’ groupClaim funeral law not broken on day of Bobby Storey’s is nonsense: top undertakerTUV and DUP reaction to PSNI appeal for ‘LGBT+ allies’Most PopularLoyalist flute band claims PSNI acted in ‘bad faith’ over parades investigationBiggest NI arms haul in a decade hits ‘kill capacity’ of crime gangDoug Beattie: Power-sharing at risk thanks unanswered questions over Bobby Storey funeralNI weather this weekend: Heavy rain and strong winds to clobber Northern Ireland with drier brighter weather not expected tountil MondaySam McBride: A curious episode shows that the NI protocol is now too confusing for even the EU to understand                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-kafWEX sc-feJyhm dbjzDR\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy  News you can trust since Sign in   \"    Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensPuzzlese-PaperCoronavirusMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessRecommended\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      RecommendedFashion and BeautyDealsHome and GardenPublic NoticesFollow us       \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

One NI super fan tells HELEN MCGURK why he just loves the enormous musical spectacleBy Helen McGurkSaturday, nd May , : am  \"       \"  ]]Nicky McElhatton at the Eurovision in Vienna in When he was a youngster, Nicky McElhatton’s family would gather round the television to watch the Eurovision Song Contest - the gleefully awful show that has been entertaining viewers since  with dodgy songs and downright loopy acts. “I’ve always been a fan of Eurovision,” said the -year-old, who hails from Coalisland, Co Tyrone. “It was a family tradition to watch it. We had your flags out waving and supporting our favourite countries or we’d do a pool where everyone would pick a country out of hat and support that country. It was a bit of fun, something you didn’t really take too seriously.”   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...Nicky with former Eurovision winner Linda MartinNicky recalls caravan holidays to Donegal and the family joining in the Eurovision frenzy in a pub in Bundornan. “I think that year Eimear Quinn from Ireland won so we were all getting into it.”Love it, or loathe it, Eurovision is back after a year hiatus due to the coronavirus pandemic and tonight’s event in Rotterdam will undoubtedly dish up some of the most cringe-tastic, bizarre acts Europe has to offer. But will they be any weirder than the baking Russian grannies of   Or Ireland’s Dustin the Turkey in , a creepy puppet, singing a twisted electro-rave version of Irish folk. There’s too many cheesy songs and freakshow Eurovision moments to recount, but that doesn’t stop Nicky, who works for a community finance company, loving it, blogging about it and even running events here in Northern Ireland to celebrate the showy show. “The obsession just grew and grew and whenever I started blogging about the Eurovision in  it has spiralled from there,” he said. Eurovision host Graham Norton“I’ve been to two of the contests - the  one in Vienna and in  I went to Lisbon. We were due to go last year and then it got cancelled and we were due to go this year as well, but with the travel restrictions we decided against it.”But, despite not getting to Rotterdam, Nicky has cherished memories. “In Vienna we went to the stadium for one of the rehearsal shows. It was just amazing to be really part of that buzz and to have all the Eurovision fans around you, who just love it as much. People were dressed up in their fancy dress and waving their flags and cheering on their country. People really come from all over the world for it. Nothing really beats that buzz of being there.”In the last few years Nicky’s obsession has taken on a new “lease of le”. His Eurovision NI Facebook page has in excess of , members, and the events he runs are a massive hit with fans. “We did screenings of the dferent national finals that are on from between January and March. We also do an annual awards show. The last one was in  in the Crumlin Road Gaol and we had Linda Martinperforming for us. We had people from England and Denmark who travelled over that.“We gave out awards in dferent categories, both positive and negative, so we had the likes of best song, worst song, worst dressed, that sort of thing. And then a disco afterwards.“There weren’t really that many events for fans in Northern Ireland and that’s why I started doing my own events. A lot of people probably view Eurovision as just one night a year, on a Saturday night when the final is on. But for diehard Eurovision fans it’s a whole season from December the year before right through until the final, so it’s a good five or six months of lead up to it.”Despite the Eurovision being cancelled last year, Nicky held an online watch party with the songs that had already been picked and attendees could vote for their favourites. “It was just really to fill that void of Eurovision not being on. We wanted to put something on in its place and try to remain as true as possible to the actual contest.“Tonight we are kind of limited in what we can do so it’ll probably be just myself and one or two friends watching it in the house because that’s just what restrictions allow, but at least it is on this year.”The Eurovision was, for many, synonymous with the late, great, Terry Wogan. Introducing the  contest from Finland he said: “Who knows what hellish future lies ahead  Actually, I do. I’ve seen the rehearsals.” And that would set the tone for an evening of Wogan: his risqué jokes, sharp one-liners, grudging praise and knack for saying what everyone at home was thinking. Graham Norton took over the reins in  and, said Nicky, both were always willing to “poke fun” at the contest or “point out any kind of tactical voting.”During his tenure Wogan never tired of jokingly insinuating Eurovision was awash with voting cartels, about as close to a free exercise in democracy as a general election in North Korea.Nicky is less cynical: “There is an element of politics to it, but I also think it’s not a case that you are voting for your neighbours, you are voting for countries that probably have a similar culture to you.“Ireland and the UK tend to give each other points and that’s because the music that gets released is quite similar. For Scandinavia, you find that Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Finland tend to give each other points, but again that’s probably because the artists that are representing them are known in those countries and also the style of music they use would reflect the interest of the population of that country as well. But having said that there clearly is some politics involved as well. The big thing at the minute is what’s happening in Israel, so although the contestant this year has a really good song, it will be interesting to seethere’s any backlash in terms of international politics, because I think that’s what would prevent her from qualying rather than the song or the performance.” Nicky has an encyclopedic knowledge of Eurovision. Ask him who won in , for example, and he’ll answer, quick as a flash, ‘Corinne Hermès’.Unsurprisingly, he once applied to go on Mastermind with, naturally enough, Eurovision as his specialist subject.“I didn’t get on to it, I just auditioned.”As for favourite Eurovision songs, he finds it hard to choose. “There was a song for Sweden in  called Popular , that would be my favourite one, but there’s been so many over the years. “One that gets quite a lot of hype, but I don’t really thinks lives up to it, is the  Portuguese winner Salvador Sobral. His song was called Amor Pelos Dois, but it was just a bit too slow for me. I prefer the pop, up-beat tracks.”In terms of winners Nicky believes tonight’s contest is a “wide open field”.“The bookies are saying it’s between Italy , Franceand Malta , but I think there’s about another seven songs that you could easily throw into the mix. “Personally, I could see someone like Malta winning just because it’s an upbeat pop song, it’s got a positive message, her staging’s good, she’s got a good voice and it would be nice to see a country that hasn’t won it before, win. “Malta would also be a great host destinationthey won and hosted next year.”Ireland’s entry Lesley Roy, from Dublin, failed to make it through the semi-final stage with her song ‘Maps’. *The Eurovision is on BBC  toight at pmA message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Photo: Charles McQuillan GettyOn March  this newspaper revealed that just weeks after the DUP said it was blocking recruitment of Irish Sea border inspectors, DUP minister Edwin Poots’s department had advertised for port inspectors.A month earlier the temporary DUP agriculture minister Gordon Lyons dramatically announced that he was halting work on Irish Sea border infrastructure and stopping the recruitment of staff to carry out checks.However, after the revelation that the department had quietly U-turned, it said that the advert had “incorrectly specied” that the staff would be working on the sea border and said it would be halting the recruitment “until further notice”.   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...Now documents released by the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairsunder the Freedom of Information Act show that a civil servant, whose name has been blacked out, raised concerns about what they were being asked to do in response to the News Letter revelation.The official said on March  – the day of the story: “I’m going to raise the issue of uncertainty around this because I am confused now as what we are allowed to do.“What has happened is not what was agreed advised to me so I’m going to ask for something formally in writing.“I think this is necessary to protect those of us who are working in this particular work area from accusations that we have been doing something incorrectly.”Another civil servant, whose name has also been blacked out, replied to say that they agreed. The News Letter asked the department to explain what civil servants were told to do verbally – but not in writing – which left them feeling so uncomfortable.Another document shows that chief vet Robert Huey approved the recruitment of port inspectors on  March – the day before the News Letter report. Dr Huey is one of the department’s most senior officials who would be in contact with the minister. DAERA was asked whether Dr Huey either withheld that information from the minister orthe minister did in fact have some knowledge that recruitment was continuing.DAERA responded: “The minister has always been clear that recruitment of port staff should cease until further clarity is received from the UK Government and consideration is given to the requirements for NI Points of Entry by the Northern Ireland Executive.“On March , the department claried to the News Letter that an advertisement seeking to recruit agricultural inspectors, mistakenly specied that new staff would be solely located to the Points of Entry.“The department also confirmed to the News Letter that the minister is not involved in routine recruitment and therefore was unaware of this advert being placed.”The department was also askedany official has been investigated or disciplined for disobeying the minister’s direction. There was no response.Recruitment continued, despite DUP claimAlmost  pieces of internal departmental documentation released to the News letter give scant information about the DUP’s claimed halt to recruiting Irish Sea border staff having made any dference.On February  the then minister, Gordon Lyons, announced: “I instructed my department to halt work on a range of issues relating to work at the ports. This is in and around a number of areas...[including] the additional recruitment of staff...”Internal emails show that officials carried on work on recruitment for weeks.On March , an official emailed what a recruitment agency in relation to “agency Veterinary Inspectors Larne Port”.They said: “As advised there is an urgent need with this request and it gets more pressing with every day that goes by...As I say this is extremely urgent”. Another email said to “avoid delay” because “Larne Port is very short of veterinary resource”.Another email on March , days after the apparent freeze on recruitment, asked an agency for Larne Port inspectors, saying “this is an urgent need”. Two days later they said: “I really need this progressed urgently”. Later that day an email said £, had been cleared for recruiters Premiere Employment Group to fill the posts. Still more staff were being recruited for Warrenpoint Port as late as March .DAERA said Mr Poots was unaware of all this activity.:Sam McBride: After four years at the top of Sinn Féin, Michelle O’Neill has good reason to be nervousSam McBride: Rather than a DUP lurch to the right, this is about toppling the old orderSam McBride: Don’t assume Edwin Poots is more hardline than Sir Jeffrey Donaldson – the truth is more nuancedSam McBride: From his s, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson was seen as a future unionist leader – now might be his final chanceSam McBride: Is stolen Northern Bank cash in politics  Alarmingly, no one seems botheredSam McBride: How Arlene Foster fell: Even as she dismissed the threat, the knives were being plungedAs Edwin Poots steps forward to contest DUP leadership, Peter Robinson urges cautionSam McBride: The most important firm in Northern Ireland you’ve probably never heard of – but are paying forSam McBride: On the streets and in Stormont, the next few months look bleak for Northern IrelandAnarchy on the Shankill as men and women urge children to riot, with no hint of political protestLeaked internal DUP minutes show fear of looming electoral collapse, and dismay at party’s directionBrandon Lewis interview: Denial of the Irish Sea border is gone as SoS says parts of frontier are being ditched for good——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

During my  years as a community campaigner I have passionately campaigned for education, creating more opportunities for young people, tackling the housing crisis and the climate crisis. I was the regeneration officer for the Loudoun Square and Trowbridge redevelopment, and was selected as the Wales delegate for the International Association for Community Development and Commonwealth Games in Glasgow . Over the last  years Irsquove supported young people in Cardf South and Penarth to develop their skills in the arts and creative industries and to participate in a wide range of opportunities. I successfully gained the London  Olympic Cultural Inspire Mark for Butetown Community. I entered politics because of the increasing injustice around me - increasing food banks, homelessness, education, climate crisis, lack of opportunity for our youth, lack of affordable housing I was sick and tired of our communities being treated like second class citizens by the London elite. I want a fair deal for our communities for Cardf South and Penarth and for Wales.Alan Golding - Freedom Alliance. No Lockdown. No CurfewsRaised in Tonyrefail, Rhondda Cynon Taff, I have since lived in Brighton and Glasgow, moving to Cardf in . Since my early twenties Irsquove been interested in the workings of society and how we treat each other, animals and our planethellip and in the process Irsquove come to completely mistrust virtually all career politicians. I believe a new way of doing politics is needed in Wales with a new set of values across the whole system. I donrsquot believe the current political structure and its controllers have the interest of the people at its heart with regard to their mental and physical health, their quality of le and spiritual and economic well-being.     Paul Campbell - UKIPHello Im Paul Campbell and Im standing in the Cardf South and South Wales Central area for UKIP in the Senedd elections on MAY TH.Being. Born in Cardf and lived most of my le there I appreciate the Greatv Potential the pride and the Welsh Identity in Cardf and the Valleys towns. and I have seen how things have changed over the years with parts of the area unrecognizable from the place I remember.Areas of Cardf have become run down and standards have fallen with a loss of community spirit The surrounding Towns have been neglected with. A lack of investment and job creation initiatives.Mass immigration in the UK has put tremendous strains on cities like Cardf Newport and Swansea with wage depression and overstretched public services.. The Conservatives claim to be in control of immigration but they will only ever talk about it and under there watch in the in the last  years  million more people have come to our shires thats  cities the sthe size of Cardf . Increasingly they are choosing to come to Wales as Labour has encouraged them by a making Wales a Nation Of sanctuary.Helen Westhead - Green PartyOur current administration has ignored the climate emergency and has left so many people vulnerable and excluded. As we recover from the pandemic we have unique opportunity to create better ways of working - the influence of an elected Green in the room will be transformative.We see from across the UK, Europe, and beyond the incredible dference Greens make, holding government to account, speaking out against inequality, and representing real people and their communities, not political or corporate interest. Wales is long overdue that representation in the Senedd.We know that the way we recover from this pandemic and build back stronger is through investing in communities and public services, ensuring everyone has access to local facilities, and supporting small business. If elected, one of my main priorities would be better walking and cycling routes, connected to affordable public transport and green outdoor spaces that communities can enjoy. Advocating for a Universal Basic Income would ensure no one is left behind in our bold plan to transform Wales.With the more proportional voting system on the regional ballot in Wales, Labour cannot win regional seats. A Green vote on your second ballot is the only progressive option.Matt Friend - PropelPropel has led the campaigns on two of the most important issues affecting Barry, Penarth and Cardf.Wersquore the only party that has committed not to allow any nuclear mud to be dumped in our waters, including the mud dredged from outside Hinkley nuclear reactor in Somerset.And wersquore the only party that even mentions the scandal of dangerous fire risk cladding on so many of our flats and buildings. Through our Contract with Wales we have committed not to issue new building contracts to any housing developer involved in the scandal, until they have paid to fix the problem they created.Wersquoll also end the way leaseholders are getting rinsed by introducing a service charge cap, linked to the Retail Price Index. That will stop the double digit increases in service charges that leaseholders have had to put up with.Most importantly, wersquoll introduce a Coronavirus Recovery Act to end Welsh lockdowns, save lives and restore freedoms. We canrsquot just hope wersquoll get our freedoms back, we have to vote for them.The ten laws in our Contract with Wales will transform our nation. Wales needs champions. Vote Propel.Alex Wilson, Liberal DemocratsI live with my family in Penarth and I became involved in politics because of the widening isions that seemed to occurring our community. I feel that with the Liberal Democrat core values of tolerance and understanding we can bring people back together. We can cut through the shouting of partisan politics and once again listen to what people want in their community.The next five years is going to be critical and I feel the Senedd must put recovery first. That means recovering from the Covid pandemic, the recovery of our economy, better healthcare services and a happier community which can be achieved by better transport links, saving our environment and ato community values.Irsquove been around long enough to know a political status-quo without a strong opposition can breed complacency. Wersquove seen this in national and local government. If I am elected I will ensure that the voice of the people is heard. If yoursquove ever wondered how we almost lost the Kymin or how they plan to build over  homes on contaminated land at Cosmeston Farm in Sully, well itrsquos because our current political leaders often lack empathy with local communities.Other candidates standing are:Vaughan Gething - LabourAngus Hawkins - Gwlad The Welsh Independence PartyLisa Peregrine ndash Abolish the Welsh Assembly Party Alan Pick ndash Reform UKDavid Rolfe ndash IndependentLeighton Rowlands ndash Conservative article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Otherwise a coalition must be attempted.:Who can vote Anyone over the age of  can vote in the Senedd election provided they are:- registered to do so- living in Wales- not legally excluded from votingThis is the first time  and -year-olds have been eligible to vote. What impact that has on the result remains to be seen.How do I vote There are three ways - in person, by post and by proxy - however, the deadlines for latter two options have already passed.Voting at the polling booth with take place until pm today.Polling stations will be kitted out with hand sanitiser and distancing markers to help voters remain safe from coronavirus.Most crucially, voters are being asked to bring their own pen or pencil.Face coverings must also be worn, unless exempt.How does the voting system work Each voter will have two votes - one constituency vote and one regional vote.Youll be represented in the Senedd by five Members. One for your constituency and four for the region of Wales where you live.Constituency vote - this is for the person you want to represent you and your local area. Wales has  constituencies, with each being represented by one MS in the Senedd. Constituency votes are counted in a first past the post system - so the candidate with the most votes is elected.     Regional vote - This is for who you want to represent your region of Wales - South Wales East, South Wales Central, South Wales West Mid and West Wales and North Wales. There are  regional Senedd Members, elected by the additional member system.When will results be announced As with a lot of things this past year, the election has been hit by Covid restrictions.While voting will happen today, counting will not take place the same night as is usually the case on election night.Instead, the votes will be taken to the counting locations and kept secure until morning.They will then be veried - spoiled ballots removed - and counted.Due to Covid restrictions, this will likely take longer than in normal counts, but results are expected within two days of polls closing.Keep an eye on the Argus website for the latest, and results. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The bypass could have cut congestion in Dinas too, a current problem.The wider Dinas transport project has cost pound,, mostly from Welsh Government, but including pound, from the Vale council.Councillor Peter King, cabinet member for transport, said: ldquoWelsh Government is moving very much away from road building into tackling climate change, which I really find some dficulty objecting to.ldquoIt has always frustrated me that the work was seen as the Dinas Powys bypass. But it wasnrsquot mdash it was the Dinas Powys transport infrastructure, because it included all sorts of things, including cycle networks and better access to train stations.     He revealed the costs during a meeting of the full council on Monday, April , after a question from Cllr Ian Johnson, leader of the Plaid Cymru group on the Vale.However some of the wider works to improve transport around Dinas could still be funded where, like from the Cardf Capital Region, a body of  councils across south-east Wales. One project that could go ahead includes a cycle route from Newport to Barry.Cllr King said: ldquoWe think we can probably pursue some of [wider work] through the city region, and we have also been awarded money for the active travel Newport to Barry route. So some of the other elements of the transport infrastructure we can pursue.ldquoBut wersquoll wait until after the election [on May ] to see whorsquos in charge, before we decide what to do next. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityIt was girl power when ten female walkers joined Joy and sheepdog Bracken from Penarth and District Ramblers at Penarth clftop for an . mile walk, with no stiles only gates and which would see them experiencing the weather of all four seasons in one day. They set off on a socially distanced walk in lovely spring sunshine across the old pitch and putt course before joining part of the old railway line, now a walk and cycle way, and heading through a built up area Lavernock Road led them into Cosmeston Country Park.Past the eastern lake with its floating jetty where canoes can be safely launched and making their way through the eastern paddock with its carpet of pretty cowslips, open meadows led them towards Old Cogan Hall Farm, where they deviated into the churchyard of St Peterrsquos for morning break in glorious warm sunshine reminiscent of summer. Admiring the herring bone masonry which dates to Celtic and Saxon times and the ancient yew trees that could even pre-date this lovely old church, which allegedly is the oldest building in Penarth and hearing some of its long and interesting history, it fell into disrepair in the th century. By the th century the ruinous building was a cattle shelter until the latter part of the rsquos when the rd Marquis of Bute was persuaded to pay for its renovation.Mile Road built by the Bute family led them to the western paddock and through the sun-dappled Cogan Wood to re-enter fields where a footbridge led them across the Sully Brook for the short climb up to Home Farm, with its glorious views towards the eastern end of Barry and the surrounding farmland. Exiting through a gate, some road walking in a southerly direction brought them into Sully village and pounding pavements to reach the Jubilee Hall and the cricket field, the full beauty of Sully Bay with its views across the Bristol Channel towards the Somerset coastline and Hayes Point to the west confronted them.     With the wind beginning to pick up they tramped by track and field to the public slipway at Sully beach and stopped for lunch utilising rocks for seating whilst gazing eastwards towards Sully Island and Flat and Steep Holm beyond, as clouds thickened overhead and the temperature dropped making it feel more like autumn.Time to move on along part of the long distance Wales Coast Path, through the playing fields to exit onto Beach Road, following it to the car park of the Captainrsquos We where there were only a few people sitting at outdoor tables for food and drink, not really enjoyable in the cool breeze.The fairly quiet St Maryrsquos Well Bay Road brought them up past The Bay Caravan Park and into fields with growing crops where, without any warning a sudden short sharp shower of rain engulfed the group forcing coats to be swtly donned.Crossing a wooden footbridge into the delightful Lavernock Nature Reserve the grassy path led them into the remains of the WW gun emplacements. Initially in the late rsquos the original Lavernock Gun Battery was built to protect the Bristol and Cardf shipyards and the Bristol Channel, but unfortunately most of the original buildings now lie underneath the caravan park.Being bombarded by a short hail storm whilst moving on through the nature reserve, lovingly cared for by volunteers and passing the man-made pond with its surrounding carpet of bluish violet bugle, a plant which attracts moths, butterflies and bees, before exiting onto Fort Road their route led them past the Marconi Holiday Village and the Church of St Lawrence before heading along the clftop. With thick black clouds heading up the English side of the Bristol Channel, the race was on to get back before the rain hit. As the weather turned wintry and the wind increased, a huge shower of hailstones and heavy rain struck them on the open Penarth clftop soaking them as they made their way back to their start point.You can follow the grouprsquos exploits before, during and after lockdown on Facebook. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Scepticism had been rising on all sides over the lack of signicant movement off Mr Bidenrsquos . trillion dollarplan, or the Republicansrsquo proposed  billion dollaralternative.White House press secretary Jen Psaki said the proposal exhibits a willingness to come down in size over the final sum, as talks got under way between key cabinet secretaries and Republican senators. vw,vw,px, px\"US president Joe Biden But after the hour-long meeting, the Republicans quickly rejected the new approach as ldquowell above the range of a proposal that could win bipartisan support.The two sides ldquoseem further apart than when negotiations began, according to a statement from an aide to Republican senator Shelley Moore Capito.The White House and the Republican senators have been in talks ever since Mr Biden met with a core group of Republican negotiators over the possibility of working together on an infrastructure plan.The White House dispatched the transportation and commerce secretaries and top aides to Capitol Hill to meet with the Republicans earlier this week, and they had a follow-up video call on Friday.According to a memo obtained by The Associated Press, the administrationrsquos new approach is cutting more than  billion dollarsfrom the presidentrsquos initial offer. vw,vw,px, px\"Senator Shelley Moore Capito meets the US president But the memo makes clear Mr Biden is not interested in the Republicansrsquo idea of having consumers pay for the new investments through tolls, fuel taxes or other fees.     Instead, the administration is sticking with his proposal to raise corporate taxes to pay for the new investment, which is a red line for Republicans.ldquoOur approach should ensure that corporations are paying their fair share, said the memo from the administrationrsquos negotiators to the Republican senators.But Republicans dismissed the new White House offer as ldquovery marginal movement on the top line without much dference in policy, according to a Republican insider. The new offer was ldquodisappointing, the aide said.Securing a vast infrastructure plan is Mr Bidenrsquos top priority as he seeks to make good on his campaign pledge to ldquobuild back better in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis and the economic churn from a shting economy. vw,vw,px, px\"Signicant dferences remain between the White House and Republican senators With narrow Democratic majorities in the US house and senate, the president is reaching out to Republicans for support on a potentially bipartisan approach rather than relying simply on his own party to muscle the proposal through.Republicans are adamantly opposed to Mr Bidenrsquos proposed corporate tax increase to pay for the package, refusing to undo the  tax cuts, the partyrsquos signature domestic accomplishment under Donald Trump.They reduced the corporate rate from % to %.

Unfortunately, both Sean and his father were thrown from the kayak into the freezing cold water.Sean’s father was washed ashore and despite frantic efforts he was unable to reach his son who was stuck in the water against a wall at the opposite bank. Thankfully a local father and son - Mike Greerand his -year-old son Zachery - were able to pull Sean safely out of the water and alert the emergency services. ]]Due to the severity of the incident, the Helicopter Emergency Medical Service , flown by Air Ambulance Northern Ireland were tasked to the scene along with a number of emergency first response teams.Fortunately Sean has recovered well and as a result of his experience he wanted to do something positive that would potentially help another person who might need the air ambulance in future.Sean’s mum Elaine said, “We wanted to do something that would give back. Air Ambulance NI is a wonderful service that we cannot take for granted. “The service has been tasked to our council area  times in  and it can only help people with donations to support its sustainability. We are so thankful that Sean wanted to do something and that’s him, he has so much grit and determination and we are so proud of him.”Just two months after Sean’s ordeal in the water, both he and his father took on the mighty challenge of summitting Northern Ireland’s highest peak, Slieve Donard to raise funds for the lesaving service. The seven-year-old initially set himself the goal of raising £ but was overwhelmed when his final total came in at £,! His mum said, “Sean is so grateful to every single person who donated to his Just Giving page and helped him smash his target. If the money pays half the fuel or pays towards saving somebody ’s le, it will have been worth it. “Every step Sean took on that mountain really was to help ensure someone  got pre-hospital critical carethey needed it - every penny donated will help that cause.”At the beginning of May, Sean and his family were delighted to be one of the first patient families to visit the air ambulance base with the easing of lockdown restrictions. Sean was delighted to get a tour of the airbase and hear all about how his donation will help others who are potentially in le threatening situations. Mum Elaine commented, “Sean has not stopped talking about his visit to see the air ambulance. He also signed up as a Junior Club member with the charity and so was delighted to wear his branded lanyard and bring along his teddy to get his photo by the helicopter. “He was given a tour, had lots of questions answered and was delighted to hear more about the pilot’s role within the team, as this is something he’s really interested in. “He was also given a copy of the charity newsletter and hasn’t put it down - that’s really helping him with his reading too! We are just so delighted that something that could have turned out to be a devastating situation has had such a positive outcome and we are extremely proud of our young boy who is a big air ambulance fan!”The charity Air Ambulance Northern Ireland, in partnership with the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service, provides the HEMS for Northern Ireland. The service brings urgent medical assistance to anywhere in the province, operating seven days a week for  hours per day. It can get to anywhere in Northern Ireland in approximately twenty-five minutes.How we reported Sean’s rescue in February - read hereEditor’s message:Thank you for reading this article.
