Surely Mr Abramovich should no longer be able to own a football club in this country? Surely we should be looking at seizing some of his assets including his £152million home? And making sure that other people who have had Tier 1 Visas like this are not engaged in malign activity?\u0027In 2011 the High Court heard that Mr Abramovich had used the well-connected oligarch Boris Berezovsky as his \u0027political godfather\u0027 to help him conduct business deals in a country where police were \u0027corrupt\u0027 and courts \u0027open to manipulation,The court heard the Chelsea owner believed it was his \u0027moral obligation\u0027 to hand Mr Berezovsky £1.3billion to fund his lavish lifestyle.The Chelsea owner gave his former friend the cash because he felt it was part of the \u0027code of honour\u0027 that had replaced the rule of law in Russia after the collapse of communism, it was alleged. The billionaire has not been seen at his Premier League football club\u0027s south-west London home, Stamford Bridge, for months. He withdrew his application for a British Tier 1 investor visa in 2018, after reported delays in his application following criticism of Russian oligarchs in the wake of the Salisbury poisonings. Downing Street would not be drawn on the claims about Roman Abramovich made in the Commons.The Prime Minister\u0027s official spokesman said: \u0027I couldn\u0027t comment on iniduals in that way or on leaked documents of that type.\u0027Chelsea may go bust ‘if Abramovich were to face any sanctions’ | News | The Times"},{"url":null,"title":"Is rattled Putin set unleash father bombs","story":"Share this article One Western official said: ‘The Ukrainians have done a lot of effective work to slow down the Russians’ advance.

Photograph: Getty The Government is to close Irish airspace to all Russian aircraft in response to the country’s invasion of Ukraine, the Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney has said.The move comes after the UK Department of Transport barred Russian commercial and civilian aircraft from British airspace on Friday in an escalation of measures against the Kremlin.In a Sunday morning tweet, Mr Coveney announced the Government’s plan after referring to “shocking” overnight Russian attacks in Ukraine.“Ireland will move to shut off Irish airspace to all Russian aircraft. We encourage other EU partners to do the same,” he said. Russian troops entered Ukraine’s second largest city Kharkiv in the east of the country near the Russian border where there was fighting in the streets with Ukrainian military forces. An oil depot about 30 km south west of the Ukrainian capital Kyiv was also targeted overnight.A ban on Russian aircraft in Irish airspace will affect Russian aircraft flying over Ireland and any direct flights into the country. The Irish Aviation Authority will enforce the measure.Mr Coveney also said in his Sunday morning tweet that the Government supported the “new wide-ranging sanctions” to be agreed today when the EU’s Foreign Affairs Council meets to take consider further measures against Russia.Last Thursday, the UK government banned Russia’s national airline Aeroflot from landing in Britain following Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine.The airline suspended flights to London and Dublin until May 23rd in response to the restrictions imposed by the UK authorities. In retaliation to the UK ban, Russia’s civil aviation regulator banned British airlines from landing at Russia’s airports and from crossing its airspace. The move was a response to “the unfriendly decisions by the UK aviation authorities,” Russia said.On Saturday the United States and the European Union moved to block certain Russian banks from accessing the Swift international payment system in punishment for the attack on Ukraine.Last night Mr Coveney has advised Irish citizens to avoid all essential travel to Russia.Warning on sanctions The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment also warned private companies on Saturday evening that they have an obligation to ensure they are in full compliance with new trade sanctions imposed on Russia.In a statement, the department said this second package builds on, and significantly expands, the first package of sanctions adopted on February 23rd.“All EU sanctions regulations have direct effect in all member states of the EU, and, as such, are legally binding on all natural and legal persons in Ireland. Private companies, therefore, have an obligation to ensure that they are in full compliance with these new measures. A natural or legal person who contravenes a provision of an EU sanctions regulation shall be guilty of an offence and liable to prosecution.“The sanctions involve a prohibition on the sale, supply transfer or export of dual use goods and technology, to Russia or for use in Russia. There is also a prohibition on the sale, supply, transfer or export, of specific goods and technology, listed which might contribute to Russia’s military and technological enhancement, to Russia or for use in Russia.”The department said the sanctions also involve a prohibition in relation to sale, supply transfer and export of goods and technology suited for use in the oil refining aviation or space industry to Russia.“For each of the aforementioned prohibitions on exports of goods and technology, there is a corresponding prohibition on the provision of technical assistance, brokering services or other services, including financial services, related to the goods and technology.“These prohibitions apply irrespective of whether the goods or technology originate in the EU or not.”The regulation sets out specific grounds on which the exporters can apply to the Competent Authority (Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment) for a partial or temporary exemption from the prohibitions.“These grounds include humanitarian, medical applications, maritime safety, software updates, and for the execution of contracts entered into prior to 26 February 2022. Applications must be submitted in accordance with the procedure set out in the Regulation.“However, the grounds for derogation are much narrower in respect of specific end-users, listed in the Regulation, affiliated with the Russian military.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"state","story":"State papers: Perception on the Shankill Road in 1990s was \u0026lsquofear of encroachment\u0026rsquo-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"eu must organise itself as a real continental power or face oblivion verhofstadt","story":"Former Belgian PM Guy Verhofstadt said there was ‘a need’ for member states to deliver ‘defensive military equipment’  to Ukraine. Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillThe European Union needs to learn the lessons of the Ukraine crisis and organise itself as a “real continental power” in economic, financial and military terms or it faces fading into oblivion, former Belgian prime minister and current MEP Guy Verhofstadt has said in Dublin.Mr Verhofstadt, speaking to the media during a conference on the future of Europe organised by the Institute of International and European Affairs at Dublin Castle on Saturday, likened the Russian invasion of Ukraine to the 911 attacks in New York. He said there was “a need” for member states to deliver “defensive military equipment” to Ukraine. “The world will never be the same,” he said. “I have the same feeling today that I got after 911. “When that happened, the reaction of everyone was that the world will never be the same after 911 as it was before. I have to tell you, I have exactly the same feeling today about this conflict.“My feeling is that whatever happens to Ukraine, and we can only hope that Ukraine will prevail – their values, their democracy, their society and what they represent – will create a shock in Europe to take its destiny in its own hands.”Mr Verhofstadt said this would involve the bloc organising itself “as a real continental power in economic, financial and military terms”.“That will be necessary in the world of tomorrow, which is already the world of today,” he said.“That’s the world of so-called empires, super-powers, China, India, Russia, and the US. Europe has to take the lesson that we need to do a number of reforms to make it a real European Union, because it is not a union today. “It is, in my opinion still, a consideration based on the unanimity always acting too little too late, and this is an example of that. So it will dramatically change, or we will disappear into irrelevance, which is always possible in history.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"german rude awakening on russia infuriates poland","story":"Finland’s foreign minister Pekka Haavisto and German foreign minister Annalena Baerbock  speaking in Brussels on Friday before  a special meeting of the EU Foreign Affairs Council on Russia’s invasion of  Ukraine. Photograph: Olivier HosletEPAAwakenings don’t come any ruder than the one Russian president Vladimir Putin, by invading Ukraine, delivered this week to Berlin.Until Thursday morning German foreign minister Annalena Baerbock insisted that Berlin’s dual path – of diplomacy backed by sanction threats – was the correct one with Russia. By Thursday evening her\u0026nbsppalpable outrage – at growing civilian casualties and a flagrant breach of the international order – culminated in an expression of how, until the end, Moscow had duped her.“We have to say we were lied to,” she said in a television interview, her voice trembling. “They stone-cold lied to us.”Official German shock, surprise and, now, regret over its political approach with Moscow have all sparked anger in neighbouring Poland and its Baltic neighbours.In Warsaw a bit of gallows humour doing the rounds on Friday about Berlin’s take on Russia drew on the wisdom of cartoon character Homer Simpson: “It takes two to lie: one to lie and one to listen.”“Berlin listened to Russian lies and believed ... either due to a lack of imagination or because of pure self-interest on a massive scale,” said Eugeniusz Smolar of Warsaw’s Centre for International Relations.\u0026nbspSmolar was jailed in 1968 for protesting against the Soviet invasion of neighbouring Czechoslovakia and later was involved in the Solidarity opposition movement.\u0026nbspOn Friday, after three decades of pro-EU engagement in Poland, as a journalist and analyst, his shattered illusions are not towards Moscow – but Berlin. “Germany has lost a lot of goodwill in this region, first for its Russia approach but even more now after refusing to back a Russian ban from Swift.”At late-night talks in Brussels on Thursday, Berlin insisted on holding in reserve a Russian ban from the international payments network. On Friday Ms Baerbock explained that a ban could have unintended consequences, “hitting a granddaughter who wants to transfer money to her grandmother, while those responsible for the bloodshed have their own way to move their finances around”. Business interestsThat has not impressed all of Germany’s neighbours, many of whom see another move by Berlin to protect its business interests in Russia.\u0026nbspAs well as importing 55 per cent of its natural gas from Russia, Germany is one of Russia’s most significant trade partners. Direct investment amounted to about €25 billion last year, from over 3,600 companies including Mercedes-Benz, BASF and Volkswagen employing almost 280,000 people.As tensions grew some companies scaled back: building materials giant Knauf, which has annual revenues of about €12.5 billion, has closed its Donbas factory in eastern Ukraine. But others have scaled up. Engineering giant Siemens, which earns about 1 per cent of its revenue in Russia, is developing high-speed trains there, while a part-owned energy subsidiary is building power plants and equipment for 57 wind farms in Russia. The company shrugged off as “very regrettable” revelations that Siemens-made gas turbines found their way to Russian-occupied Crimea.From Tallinn to Warsaw, politicians who spent years warning that Georgia in 2008 and Crimea in 2014 were part of a bigger Putin plan, are now saying “We told you so”.Central to this western blindness, they argue, was Berlin’s block on Ukraine’s Nato and EU membership. Chancellor Angela Merkel’s long-time foreign policy adviser Christoph Heusgen defended the double refusal last year, saying Berlin “did not want to promote conflict” with Moscow.He told Der Spiegel magazine last September: “She always kept in mind what was tolerable for Russia.” Western illusionsOn Friday among Warsaw officials the frustration was palpable over Berlin’s refusal to back the toughest sanctions, including the Swift ban. Polish prime minister Mateusz Morawiecki argued that the Ukraine conflict had shattered Western illusions about the post-1989 “end of history”.“Today, however, history is returning with all the force it can muster,” he said.While EU leaders argue over the timing and scale of sanctions, senior Polish officials said on Friday that “everyone escaping the war will be received in Poland”.Michal Dworczyk, a top aide to Mr Morawiecki said: “Everyone seeking help in Poland will be able to receive it ... this includes people without passports.”Despite border queues of up to six kilometres, Poland’s interior ministry said that only a small percentage of those crossing the border were\u0026nbsparriving in reception\u0026nbspcentres set up by the government along the 540km Polish-Ukrainian border.At midnight on Saturday Poland was set to close its air space to Russian aircraft and block all Russian television stations from its airwaves.\u0026nbspPolish president Andrzej Duda delivered a stern warning to his European neighbours.“I agree entirely with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy: if you don’t help us today, then tomorrow war will knock on your door. Russia only understands the language of force: it was this way with Tsarist Russia, Communist Russia and, now, in Putin’s Russia.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Decades of progress overshadowed by Putin crackdowns and confrontation with WestRussia\u0026rsquos land of the midnight sun said to have inspired creator of Chanel No. 5Atomic icebreakers and floating power plants to help Kremlin develop Arctic shipping routeMinority nations feel squeeze as Putin\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquopower vertical\u0026rsquo crushes republics\u0026rsquo autonomyHistory of bloodshed and tragedy haunts stunning region shared by Muslims and ChristiansOil wealth and new mosque and churches help keep Tatarstan on Kremlin\u0027s sideOfficials claim West wants to \u0026lsquoGermanise\u0026rsquo and instil special identity in strategic regionNato monitors heavily armed Kaliningrad as locals long for borders to reopenAttack on renowned Memorial rights group deepens opposition anger and international alarmSaint Petersburg Letter: Russia\u0026rsquos old imperial capital celebrates 200 years since birth of Crime and Punishment creatorEnergy giant hopes vast forests will offset carbon costs and ease green transitionCircassian heritage trampled and property rows continue as Winter Olympics city boomsKremlin criticised as most Russians reject vaccination and hospitals face huge strainKremlin changes tack on global warming and looks to vast forests to offset emissionsRussia and Japan co-operate on Sakhalin despite row over nearby Kuril islandsIndustry and struggling communities fear wildlife support could stifle Far East developmentCity with echoes of San Francisco is thrillingly original, yet tarnished by graft and neglectGrowing energy, security and diplomatic links between Moscow and Beijing worry WestDecembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaintsMoscow Letter: Poet\u0026rsquos statue has been a magnet for generations of Russian dissentersOn the eve of an expected sham election, many of Putin\u0026rsquos political opponents are already jailed or dead"},{"url":null,"title":"young africans","story":"About 2.4 million forced to leave their homes during 13-year-long war with Boko HaramTom Saater has a rags to riches story and a unique insight into Nigeria\u0026rsquos biggest cityIn one of the world\u0026rsquos most dangerous places to attend school, teachers lead lessons and the students comeAfrican country\u0026rsquos tech innovators call for international investment and domestic supportYoung Nigerians dance out onto world stage with pride, confidence and high ambitionWomen-led organisation aims to stop atrocities of dictatorship from reoccurringIn the Gambia, a flourishing comedy scene is used to convey serious messagesStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"beginning end vladimir putin","story":"What is being fought in the cities of Ukraine is not just a war for that country’s freedom and future, it is a conflict that will determine Russia’s, too. Win, lose or draw, Putin has guaranteed that the Cold War – a war that arguably he never stopped fighting – is back. His regime will likely decay into isolation, economic stagnation and political repression as a result.While our intelligence services and the military analyst community were warning of an imminent, full-scale war in Ukraine, Western Putin-watchers and Russians alike had their doubts. It just seemed too dangerous, disproportionate and self-destructive. On Sunday, just before the fateful meeting of Russia’s Security Council that showed the world how isolated Putin was, and how out of touch, a Moscow-based financial analyst messaged me that he was “feeling more comfortable now – Putin’s about to pull off the biggest bluff in history”.It was not a bluff, though, and the ambition of Putin’s gamble is becoming clear. His stated objectives – Ukraine’s “demilitarisation and de-Nazification” – suggest his goal is to install a puppet government that will ensure the country remains within Russia’s sphere of influence. The obscene suggestion that modern Ukraine needs “de-Nazification” is not only a desperate rhetorical flourish to convince the Russian people that this is in some ways a parallel to the “Great Patriotic War” – the Second World War – but also a prelude to the mass arrests and, Western intelligence agencies claim, even executions of those who would resist.Putin’s plan seems to rest on a naïve assumption that it is simply a matter of taking Kyiv and announcing a new government. In fact, that is the relatively easy part – any quisling administration will then need to be maintained by force against a Ukrainian population that shows no sign of being willing to accept it. Some will fight, something that is already clear as Ukraine’s government opens up its arsenals to distribute guns among volunteers. Even those not willing or able to fight, though, will resist in other ways, from sabotage to simple, mulish non-cooperation. As a British Ministry of Defence analyst put it to me: “This isn’t going to be Occupied France – it’ll be more like the partisan war Ukrainians fought against the Germans in the Second World War.”Hubris and paranoiaThat would be a galling parallel for the Kremlin, which has made a virtual secular state religion of the war. An equally instructive one would be the Soviet Union’s invasion of Afghanistan in 1979. Again, an ageing leadership in the Kremlin airily assumed that all it needed to do was take the capital and impose a new leader, make a brief show of force and withdraw, with the Afghans now cowed and obedient. Ten years and 15,000 Soviet deaths later, Moscow withdrew from a war it could not win. The generals had been well aware that the invasion would be a terrible and dangerous blunder, but the defence minister simply refused to convey his concerns to Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev. We do not know what Sergei Shoigu, the current Russian defence minister, has been telling Putin, but judging by that Security Council meeting, this is not a president who welcomes or listens to naysaying.More significantly, while the Afghan War did not bring down the Soviet system itself, it magnified a series of debilitating trends that did. The economy was already grinding towards collapse, but Western sanctions worsened it by denying access to credits and technology. The people were already disgruntled and cynical, but as boys started coming home with broken minds or bodies, or not coming home at all, their resentment towards the Kremlin only grew. It is hard to believe that Putin is seriously thinking of this parallel, but we should, because, either way, his Russia is heading in the same direction as Brezhnev’s, driven by the same combination of hubris and paranoia.If, unlikely as it seems, Putin is able to take and hold Ukraine, even if only for a while, it will prove a Pyrrhic victory. The prospect might be that a triumphalist Russia will have pushed closer to Nato, have resisted Western pressure and be ready to unleash covert chaos on Europe if it continues to challenge the Kremlin’s claim to a sphere of influence. In the process, though, Putin will simply have re-booted the Cold War only to find himself losing it. Ukraine will be a turbulent, truculent conquest, and he cannot expect this to re-legitimise his regime like Crimea. There will be continued casualties, and it will further galvanise the West. Putin has been able to make political gains in the past by his willingness to go beyond the bounds of what we could call the etiquette of the global system. However, on every index of power – military, economic, soft, technological – Russia lags behind the West. Nato has twice as many troops as Russia (even if it is still in the process of reorienting from distant counterinsurgency operations back to mechanised European war). As we are seeing in the unfolding sanctions, the West has a massive economic preponderance. We also have other capacities that we really have not yet tapped, from cyber to cultural conflict. In the Cold War, we were willing to conduct political warfare against the Soviets and often got very good at it – these are skills we can quickly re-learn, if we are forced and willing to do so. The West is a giant that, having gorged itself on the presumed “peace idend” of the end of the Cold War, had settled down for a nap. It is beginning to awaken, thanks to Putin. Backed into a cornerIn this new Cold War, Putin’s Russia would have to cope with the three challenges of isolation, impoverishment and information. It would be treated as a pariah state, with all but a handful of partners of convenience. Of these, China would be the main one, but its relationship with Beijing would increasingly be that of client, not ally. Meanwhile, sanctions and a brain drain of the best and brightest would prevent Russia from dragging itself from its current economic stagnation. The current best-case scenario for its economy is that, by 2030, incomes are not any worse in real terms. Finally, given that even the Soviet state could not control the flow of information in the country, we should not expect today’s cynical and online Russians – they have the same level of internet use as in the UK, and many get their news from internet sources – to be any easier to dupe. Instead, Putin’s Russia would increasingly resemble the Soviet Union of the late Seventies and early Eighties, as an ageing elite presides over a country falling behind the rest of the world and a dissatisfied population is kept in line by police state methods. That led to the slow-motion car crash that Mikhail Gorbachev’s reforms actually accelerated.Of course, it seems much more likely that Putin’s gamble will wholly or partly fail. Perhaps he will end up holding on to the Donbas region, because it is hard to see how he could walk away from the war altogether without something to show for it. In any case, he can hardly walk this back. This is his war. As Emily Ferris at the defence think tank RUSI notes: “He can\u0027t step back…  he can\u0027t leave the country in the state he has created, so all those discussions about succession plans for 2024 now seem defunct.”It seems hard to think of Putin re-inventing himself at the age of 69, after 20 years in power. That means no new ideas, no serious chances to improve relations with the West. Nor does it seem likely that Putin would now voluntarily leave the Kremlin, especially as constitutionally he can hang on until 2036. How can he leave office, when that would mean handing over his life, fate and fortune to someone else? Putin is not a man who trusts easily. How can he leave power, if not on a high? He is clearly consumed by thoughts of his legacy, and there must be the temptation to wait in the hope that an unexpected triumph is just around the corner. In other words, he has backed himself into a corner.And that’s a dangerous place to be. Some years back, a staffer from the Russian Presidential Administration recalled a story that Putin himself told about his childhood in the ruins of post-war Leningrad. He and his friends would hunt the rats plaguing their apartment building. Once, caught up in the chase of a particularly large one, he found he had backed it into a corner. It turned and leapt, and young Putin fled. The staffer’s conclusion was that Putin had learnt never to let people get into that situation: “You don’t chase, you take them out quickly.” It may well also be a cautionary tale for both his own people and the West. There is likely already disquiet among his senior officials, and especially among those now facing sanctions. It would take something catastrophic to make them act, though, given Putin’s control over the security apparatus and increasing intolerance of opposition. Likewise, there are limits as to how far into that corner we will want to push a man with nuclear weapons and a penchant for escalation. The tide is turning on Putin’s generationRealistically, just as in the last Cold War, our goal must be to contain, to undermine and to wait. Just as Russian troops and influence must be pushed out of Ukraine, Putin’s capacity to harm the West must be limited, which will require everything from more robust counterintelligence activity to reducing our dependence not just on Russian oil and gas but also other key resources such as titanium. Meanwhile, our old political warfare arsenal ought to be dusted off and updated for the information age. While some are talking of blanket visa bans and the like, instead let us make it easier for ordinary Russians to see what economically dynamic and politically free democracies are like. Let us make sure that truthful news continues to be available to undermine increasingly toxic state propaganda. Let us find new ways of throwing grit into the wheels of the defence-industrial complex, from cyberattacks to starving it of the best research. All of this will have its risks and costs, to be sure, but we have too long hoped to be able to guarantee security and stability in Europe on the cheap.And, finally, patience. Ultimately, it will be for the Russians to make their choices. Putin and his generation may stay in power for years to come, but the tide is against them. Younger Russians are increasingly open in their disdain for the gerontocracy in the Kremlin and what is being perpetrated in their name. More from NewsLatest pictures from Ukraine: Russian troops have entered Kharkiv while the battle for Kyiv continuesUkraine-Russia: Volodymyr Zelensky responds to Kremlin on peace talks saying he will meet but not in Belarus\u0026#39We have been brought together for a reason\u0026#39, says Prince Harry of wife Meghan, Duchess of SussexMapped: Russia\u0026#39s invasion of UkraineSutton Hoo shipbuilder seeks donations of oak trees felled by storms to help build replicaUkraine highlights ethical value of the defence industry, says SercoMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"private life putin man behind iron curtain","story":"Of all the qualities required for being an effective spy, two surely sit right at the top of the deck: the ability to take on the appearance of whatever people want you to be and a talent for knowing when to keep schtum – especially on the subject of yourself.Vladimir Putin, it’s no surprise to learn, was an effective spy, even if he was known for taking risks. He grew up dreaming of working as a secret agent, was the son of a member of the secret police, and joined the KGB straight out of college. Over 16 years in the security service, he rose to the rank of lieutenant colonel, until the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.The nature of that start to life meant that eight years later, when the diminutive Putin was elected prime minister, then president, of the biggest country on the planet, nobody was quite sure who he was or where he had come from. Like any good agent, he could write his own backstory.  A quarter of a century on, time in which Putin has travelled from unknowable political fledgling to czarist global pariah, certain convenient aspects of his myth have become calcified, but the majority remains cloudy. More than any world leader, we still see only what he wants us to see.Here is a fact: Putin was born in Leningrad (now St Petersburg) in October 1952, five months before the death of Josef Stalin. After that things get trickier, as the primary source for most anecdotes is Putin himself. His grandfather, Spiridon Putin, was a cook for Lenin and Stalin, while his father, Vladimir Snr, served in the secret police during World War II. Once, his son said, Vladimir Snr escaped the Nazis by hiding underwater and breathing through a hollow reed, like James Bond.Putin’s father, a member of the Communist party, later became a factory worker. His mother, Maria, did various menial jobs. Young Vladimir (or Volodya, as his parents knew him) had two much older brothers who both died, one shortly after birth, the other in the Siege of Leningrad.Here is the first major question mark. In the early noughties, a Georgian woman, Vera Putina, claimed she was Putin’s real mother. Her story was vivid – involving an affair, an adoption and the nickname “Vova” – but the Kremlin strongly denied it. Two overseas journalists who were digging deeper died unexpectedly. By all accounts, including his own, Putin was a small and slight child, who grew up poor, with parents who worked most hours. He was spoilt and insolent. A primary school teacher remembered him as “not working to his full potential.”At home, the Putins\u0027 Soviet apartment block was infested with rats, which provided him with an education of sorts. In a quasi-autobiography, First Person: An Astonishingly Frank Self-Portrait, published when he emerged as a world leader, he wrote about driving one into a corner.“It had nowhere to run. Suddenly it lashed around and threw itself at me. I was surprised and frightened. Now the rat was chasing me. Luckily, I was a little faster and I managed to slam the door shut in its nose. There, on that stair landing, I got a quick and lasting lesson in the meaning of the word cornered.”Putin was an angry young man (he once recalled deliberately running a man over in a fit of road rage), and was picked on by bigger boys until he devoted himself to judo, which quickly became his favourite sport. In 1976, in what may have been his first media appearance, Leningrad’s evening paper celebrated 23-year-old “judoist Vladimir Putin”, who had won a competition. “Fifty years ago, the streets of Leningrad taught me one thing: If a fight’s inevitable, you must strike first,” he said in 2015. He now holds various martial arts black belts, and is never shy to take on an opponent for a photo opportunity.After a law degree, he was offered a job with the KGB in 1975, and began working in counter-intelligence, including in Dresden. A few years later, he met Lyudmila Aleksandrovna Ocheretnaya, an air stewardess, and married her in 1983.“I became friends with Lyuda, my future wife,” he once wrote, in what may be the least romantic passage ever penned. “I understood that if I didn’t marry for another two or three years, I would never marry. Though, of course, I had made a habit of leading a bachelor’s life. Lyudmila uprooted it.” They went on to have two daughters, Maria and Yekaterina, who – save for a few childhood snaps – were kept private until relatively recently. They reportedly attended a German-language school in Moscow and St Petersburg State University under assumed names, but have never been formally recognised as the president’s daughters. “I’m proud of them, they continue studying and they work,” he said in 2015. “My daughters speak fluently three European languages.” According to various news reports, Maria is now 36, a scientist, and married to a Dutchman. Yekaterina, now 35, was formerly an acrobatic rock n\u0027 roll dancer, but is now also a scientist. She is married to businessman Kirill Shamalov, the son of one of Putin\u0027s friends, and recently took part in a televised discussion in Russia. The appearance suggested she may be stepping out of the shadows, but there was still no mention of her unofficial father, despite a remarkably strong family resemblance.This is largely how Putin appears to conduct his private life: with fierce privacy, unless he can control it. When, in 2013, he eventually separated from Lyudmila after 30 year of marriage, the announcement was made via a suspectedly staged vox-pop after a ballet. “This is our joint decision,” Putin said. His wife, who had only truly served two years as an active first lady, joining him on overseas visits such as to meet the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh, agreed. Putin continued: “We practically don’t see each other. Each one had his and her own life.” Lyudmila has reportedly since remarried Artur Ocheretny, who chairs The Centre for the Development of Inter-Personal Communications, a non-commercial foundation she helped set up.Since then, Putin has kept quiet about his romances. There is a rumour that he has a third daughter, Luiza Krivonogikh, with former cleaner Svetlana Krivonogikh. Luiza was an active figure on Instagram, exhibiting a plush international lifestyle, but suddenly stopped posting last October. Other lovechildren have been alleged but never confirmed.For the past decade, it has been reported that Putin is in a relationship with – and maybe even fathered children with – a former Olympic gymnast called Alina Kabeava. She recently made a rare TV appearance wearing a ring on the fourth finger of her right hand, as married Russians do, raising eyebrows across all 11 of the country\u0027s timezones.An Italian journalist once deigned to ask him about it. “I have always reacted negatively to those who with their snotty noses and erotic fantasies prowl into others’ lives,” Putin replied, stonily. The spy did not like being spied upon.Much else about his life before or since rising to be leader of Russia is a mystery, though we do get occasional glimpses. He has a sprawling property portfolio, including the $1.5 billion Black Sea estate dubbed Putin\u0027s Palace. Photographs published by Alexei Navalny’s Anti-Corruption Foundation showed he has a marble swimming pool, a hookah lounge with a pole for dancing, a casino, a wine cellar, a theatre, and busts of the Greek gods. Then there are his superyachts, the latest of which is a £73 million, 240ft vessel called ‘Graceful’. This week, it was tracked leaving the shipyard in Hamburg where it was being refurbished, and arrived in Kaliningrad on Wednesday. The same day, a yacht owned by Putin’s old KGB friend, Vladimir Strzhalkovsky, was reportedly boarded by the Norwegian coastguard.Putin is a vain man, if the shirtless horse-riding photographs don’t make that clear. Inevitable ageing appeared to cease around 2010, when his somewhat goblin-like visage turned rigid and practically lunar. At the time, a joke did the rounds in Moscow: “In response to the charge that there are no new faces in Russian politics, Vladimir Putin got plastic surgery.”He supposedly rises late, takes a breakfast of an omelette or porridge with quail’s eggs, drinks coffee, works out, swims laps, then might dress in one of his bespoke Italian suits (Kiton and Brioni are favourite labels), before getting to work late in the afternoon. He then powers on through the night, and doesn’t drink alcohol.Taciturn to the West, partly due to a seemingly deliberate reluctance to use his competent grasp of English in public, he can occasionally come across as almost folksy to his people. He once spoke of loving the works of Ernest Hemingway and Jules Verne, as well as various Russian writers. He is also musical, to a point: at a charity event in St Petersburg in 2010, he both played the piano and sang Fats Domino’s Blueberry Hill before an audience that included a whooping Goldie Hawn, an admiring Gerard Depardieu, and an alarmed Kevin Costner. Putin barely smiled throughout.Generally, he projects strength, and only strength. The childhood myth he has woven is all about overcoming adversity and fighting to make it. As a politician, toughness and patriotism are all he wishes to be known for.He releases photographs of himself in nature, exploring Mother Russia, or playing ice hockey, or hunting. He walks with a KGB “gunslinger” stride – supposedly a hangover from Soviet training, one arm swings freely, the other rigid and close to where his sidearm would be. Enemies are punished, often theatrically.And none of this is accidental. In 2018, re-election posters bore the slogan: “Strong president, strong Russia.” Most politicians wish to be seen as firm, but they also want to be seen as human. To Putin, being human – being fallible – is a weakness, and “the weak are beaten.” He has written his backstory the question now is whether anybody can stop him.More from NewsUkraine-Russia: Volodymyr Zelensky responds to Kremlin on peace talks saying he will meet but not in Belarus\u0026#39We have been brought together for a reason\u0026#39, says Prince Harry of wife Meghan, Duchess of SussexMapped: Russia\u0026#39s invasion of UkraineSutton Hoo shipbuilder seeks donations of oak trees felled by storms to help build replicaUkraine highlights ethical value of the defence industry, says SercoLatest pictures from Ukraine: Russian troops have entered Kharkiv while the battle for Kyiv continuesMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"ban fur foie gras imports make uk world leader animal welfare","story":"Boris Johnson has been called upon to ban imports of foie gras and fur in a post-Brexit Britain to make the UK a “world leader on animal welfare”.Rock stars, sports and television personalities and animal welfare campaigners have signed an open letter to the Prime Minister amid concerns he plans to ditch the ban following opposition from Cabinet ministers.The letter, signed by Brian May, the Queen guitarist, and Dame Joanna Lumley, comes after more than 30,000 people signed a petition calling on Downing Street to enshrine in law a ban on imports in its Animals Abroad Bill.But Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Brexit Opportunities Minister, was recently said to be among those arguing such a ban would restrict personal choice.Fur farming and the production of foie gras, which involves force-feeding ducks or geese, are already banned in the UK. However, campaigners claim around 200 tons of foie gras and tens of millions of pounds worth of fur continue to arrive on British shores each year.The letter claims it would be “a great betrayal” of the public’s aspirations to promote animal welfare, particularly after a recent poll found 70 per cent of people in the UK supported both bans.It adds that “animals need and deserve more than warm words on animal welfare” and urges Mr Johnson to take urgent action to introduce legislation to “make the UK the proud world leader on animal welfare you want us to be”.It has also been signed by Marc Abraham, a vet, Tracy Edwards, the British sailor who sailed around the world, Vanessa-Mae, the violinist, Johnny Marr, the guitarist from The Smiths, and comedians Ricky Gervais, Romesh Ranganathan, Jon Richardson and Josh Widdicombe.Abigail Penny, executive director of Animal Equality UK, said: “The Government had no such concerns about personal choice when halting imports of elephant ivory, dog and cat meat, seal fur and whale meat.“It is already a recognised crime to produce foie gras made by force-feeding in the UK, so to continue to import and profit from this cruelty is entirely unjustifiable. To backtrack at this stage would be a travesty.”The Conservative 2019 manifesto pledged to protect animals, stating to do so was necessary in “a civilised society”. A spokesman for the Government said it was “committed” to upholding world-leading standards in animal welfare.She added: “The production of foie gras from ducks or geese using force-feeding is rightly banned in the UK as it is incompatible with our own welfare standards and fur farming has been banned in the UK for 20 years.“Through our Action Plan for Animal Welfare, we have committed to building a clear evidence base to inform decisions on the import or sale of foie gras, but no decisions have yet been made.”More from NewsUkraine-Russia: Volodymyr Zelensky responds to Kremlin on peace talks saying he will meet but not in Belarus\u0026#39We have been brought together for a reason\u0026#39, says Prince Harry of wife Meghan, Duchess of SussexMapped: Russia\u0026#39s invasion of UkraineSutton Hoo shipbuilder seeks donations of oak trees felled by storms to help build replicaUkraine highlights ethical value of the defence industry, says SercoLatest pictures from Ukraine: Russian troops have entered Kharkiv while the battle for Kyiv continuesMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"covid modelling prompted first uk lockdown based inaccurate","story":"Scientists did not have accurate Covid case numbers, and were unsure of hospitalisation and death rates when they published models suggesting that more than 500,000 people could die if Britain took no action in the first wave of the pandemic, it has emerged.On March 16 2020, Imperial College published its “Report 9” paper suggesting that failing to take action could overwhelm the NHS within weeks and result in hundreds of thousands of deaths.Before the paper, the UK coronavirus strategy was to flatten the peak rather than suppress the wave, but after the modelling was made public, the Government made a rapid u-turn, which eventually led to lockdown on March 23.However SPI-M (Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling) minutes released to the  under a Freedom of Information request show that by March 16, modellers were still “uncertain” of case numbers “due to data limitations”.The minutes show that members were waiting for comprehensive mortality data from Public Health England (PHE) and said that current best estimates for the infection fatality rate, hospitalisation rates, and the number of people needing intensive care were still uncertain.They also believed that modelling only showed “proof of concept” that lockdowns could help, and warned that “further work would be required”.The team was also encouraged to look for collaborators and resources outside of the infectious diseases network.Imperial College held a press briefing about its model on the afternoon of March 16, and on the same day, Boris Johnson ordered the public to avoid pubs, restaurants and non-essential contact and work from home if possible.At the briefing, Prof Ferguson told journalists that the new conclusions had been reached because “the last few days” had provided “refinements” in the estimates of intensive care demand and hospital surge capacity.But the minutes now show that SPI-M did not believe the data were complete.Bob Seely, the MP for the Isle of Wight, who has been critical of modelling throughout the pandemic, said: “The arguments for and against lockdown are complex, but what is becoming clear is that the evidence that the Government saw was incomplete and potentially inaccurate. “This is a national scandal. No question about it. The data that petrified politicians was inaccurate.”‘Concerning’ tendency to ‘go directly to the media’Prof Carl Heneghan, the director of the centre for evidence based medicine (CEBM) at the University of Oxford, said: “This has always concerned me about the modelling. Throughout the two years there has been systematic error, consistent over-estimation and a tendency to go directly to the media with conclusions, without validation or peer review.“It’s clear from the SPI-M minutes there were issues with the data, it wasn’t robust. And it shows that they should have been looking for additional outside expertise.“What concerns me is if we don’t fix these problems we will end up being bounced back into restrictions or end up spending money in ways that detracts from the healthcare problems at hand.”Minutes from the following day, March 17, also show that the Department of Health wanted to know whether Prof Neil Ferguson had referenced other papers in the Imperial model.And both Imperial and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) were asked to renew modelling ahead of a Sage meeting on March 18 which would “include reviewing the commonality of assumptions” and look specifically at a London lockdown, where cases were rising more quickly.The minutes continue to show uncertainties in data throughout the next year. On September 23, members said that “operational issues” with NHS Test and Trace had made it “difficult to interpret trends in the data, and added further uncertainty to the modelling”.On January 6 2021, the minutes reveal that NHS England was “unwilling” to share vaccine rollout timelines, making it difficult to estimate the impact of vaccines in modelling.And by January 17, modellers were concerned that “different data streams are presenting conflicting messages on how the epidemic is changing” while they spoke of the “great uncertainty” in the transmission dynamics of Covid by February 10.On May 26, minutes show that committee members were asked to base their future assumptions on vaccine efficacy and coverage on PHE’s weekly vaccine surveillance report, or explain the reasons for the disparity.Yet despite the plea, models used by the Government to delay Freedom Day on June 21 did not use the most up-to-date figures, which was criticised by MPs at the Science and Technology Select Committee.Early pandemic modelling ‘irresponsible’Dr Tom Jefferson of the CEBM at Oxford branded the early pandemic modelling “irresponsible”.“They should have said ‘I’m sorry, we do not have the data,” he said. “Any forecast based on limited data is just a guess, it’s unethical and reckless, and we can now see the consequences of this behaviour with people dying because of the destruction of our services.”However a spokesman for Imperial’s Covid-19 Response Team said that modellers had “always been open about the uncertainty inherent in the modelling, especially at the early stages of the pandemic”.“The ‘uncertainty’ in this minute is nothing new and can be seen in publications from the time, including Report 9.“Despite the limited data at the time, Report 9 provided a useful understanding of the epidemic, including an accurate estimate of the infection fatality rate.“Imperial modelling was repeatedly updated as new data became available.The minutes also reveal that from the beginning of March, experts were concerned about outbreaks in care homes and hospitals, yet little was done to stop the spread or protect the most vulnerable at the start of the pandemic.On April 13, SPI-M members agreed that “transmission in healthcare is a significant contributor to cases in hospitals” which they said needed further attention.The minutes also show that by October 21, SPI-M believed there was some evidence that the rate of growth may be slowing in some parts of the country, which had not yet been reflected in the hospital admission and death data.However after modelling from Cambridge University and Public Health England (PHE) suggested that without immediate restrictions there could be 4,000 deaths per day by the end of December, a second lockdown was announced by the Prime Minister on October 31.More from NewsUkraine-Russia: Volodymyr Zelensky responds to Kremlin on peace talks saying he will meet but not in Belarus\u0026#39We have been brought together for a reason\u0026#39, says Prince Harry of wife Meghan, Duchess of SussexMapped: Russia\u0026#39s invasion of UkraineSutton Hoo shipbuilder seeks donations of oak trees felled by storms to help build replicaUkraine highlights ethical value of the defence industry, says SercoLatest pictures from Ukraine: Russian troops have entered Kharkiv while the battle for Kyiv continuesMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"high street banks open just four hours week parts country analysis","story":"High street banks are open for just four hours a week in some parts of the country, Sunday  analysis can reveal.In another blow to communities who have already been hit with thousands of branch closures over the past decade, banks have been quietly cutting their opening hours so that customers are unable to access key services. Many cut them during the pandemic but have not extended them again.Politicians and campaigners accused banks of cutting services “by stealth” after more than 700 bank branches closed for good last year. They urged banks to do more for their customers at a time when many have been enjoying higher profit margins because they are not passing on rising interest rates to savers.The  analysed more than 4,000 high street banks, including all the major brands. The analysis included Barclays, Nationwide, RBS, HSBC and Natwest among others. It did not include Santander.The research found that, on average, bank branches are open for just 34 hours a week before lunchtime closing hours are included. However, rural communities can expect an average of just 29.5 hours. In south Cambridgeshire, banks are open for an average of just 15 hours a week, or 2.5 hours a day.Douglas Ross, the Scottish Tory leader, said: “High street banks closing branches or reducing their opening hours is a major problem in rural areas. Many people in remote parts of the country - especially the elderly - rely on branches being open and available because they often don’t have access to online banking. Some of them travel long distances to get to their nearest branch and are entitled to expect them to be open 9-5, Monday to Friday.”Across the country, 33 local authorities of 358, around one in 10, have no banks open on weekends, meaning those with full-time jobs may have to take a day off to access key services.Natwest had the lowest opening hours, with banks open on average just 29.5 hours a week. It was followed by Barclays at 31.5 hours and Lloyds and Bank of Scotland at 32.5 hours. Customers who rely on the Barclays in Manchester St Ann\u0027s Square are the worst affected. The branch is open for just four hours a week -10am to 12pm Tuesdays and Thursdays.Shared banking hubsThe Government has previously said that it plans to legislate to protect the future of cash and a number of initiatives have already been announced, including shared banking hubs and the availability of basic banking at Post Offices.However, much of the response has centred on communities that are being hit with bank or ATM closures rather than restricted hours.Sir Vince Cable, the former Liberal Democrat leader, said: “It is clearly part of a general withdrawal of customer services. This particular tactic is a stealthy way of closing down the network. They should be honest with the public. If they want to close they should go through the proper procedure and have the consultation, instead of trying to tiptoe out of the back door.”Baroness Ros Altmann, a former pensions minister, added: “Banks don’t seem to be working for customers’ interests. Some are doing share buybacks and giving nice bonuses but it would be good to see them treating their customers better.”She also pointed out that many people are reluctant to bank online because of the surge in fraud in recent years, particularly the elderly who are the most reliant on physical branches.Caroline Abrahams, charity director at Age UK, said: Many older people value the services provided by bank branches, in particular the human touch that a counter service can provide, so it’s a concern that more and more local bank branches are not only closing but also restricting opening hours for customers.“The scale of the bank branch cull over recent years has been extremely damaging for so many local communities nationwide and a serious blow for the millions of older people who rely on them, particularly those who are not online or confident with mobile banking.More from NewsLatest pictures from Ukraine: Russian troops have entered Kharkiv while the battle for Kyiv continuesUkraine-Russia: Volodymyr Zelensky responds to Kremlin on peace talks saying he will meet but not in Belarus\u0026#39We have been brought together for a reason\u0026#39, says Prince Harry of wife Meghan, Duchess of SussexMapped: Russia\u0026#39s invasion of UkraineSutton Hoo shipbuilder seeks donations of oak trees felled by storms to help build replicaUkraine highlights ethical value of the defence industry, says SercoMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"must amend law restore basic rights","story":"Lockdown was an extreme, crude, and untested experiment embarked upon with the minimum of thought, no advance planning and no exit route. The original decision was taken in a moment of panic with no consideration of more sensible alternatives, and no thought for the appalling collateral consequences.It failed to stop the virus, which is still with us. It inflicted untold misery and economic pain. Its main victims were the young, who were at negligible risk of death, and the poor, for whom confinement was a harsher fate. There is now mounting international evidence that it achieved nothing that could not have been achieved just as well by timely and moderate measures of social distancing and by trusting people to take common-sense steps to protect themselves. We did not need to turn ourselves into a police state.If you doubt me, look at Sweden, which rejected lockdown and suffered fewer deaths than us. Or read Mark Woolhouse’s The Year the World Went Mad, out this week from a Professor of Epidemiology and member of SAGE’S modelling committee.How can we stop this kind of thing happening again? For it will happen again if we do nothing. There will be more variants and fresh epidemics, some of them worse than this one. Governments now know that they can get away with anything if they frighten people enough. They will not forget.One of the main culprits is the Public Health Act – the legal basis of the lockdown. This statute was designed to authorise bans on mass gatherings, the isolation of infectious people and the closure of infected premises. There is nothing in it about putting the whole population, sick or not, under house arrest. The Government used it in preference to emergency legislation designed for just such crises, because they wanted to avoid the intensive Parliamentary scrutiny emergency regulations would have required.When the relevant provisions were enacted in 2008, the government of the day said that there was no need for serious Parliamentary scrutiny, because the new powers were no big deal. They only authorised measures which were “minor in scope and effect.” Yet in 2020, even the courts bent before the gale and dismissed challenges to the lockdown, disregarding the long-standing constitutional principle that only the most specific language will authorise governments to deprive citizens of their basic rights.The first thing that we have to do is put the Public Health Act back in its box. It should be amended so that people can only be deprived of their liberty and other basic rights under emergency legislation, with proper debate in Parliament beforehand or within seven days, followed by monthly Parliamentary reviews.Parliamentary scrutiny, however, will not be enough. We also have to tackle knee-jerk government. The scientists who advised the government always made it clear that it was no part of their job to think about the disastrous societal implications of their advice. As a result, “following the science” meant disregarding all the relevant social, educational, psychological and economic considerations. Yet it has to be someone\u0027s job to think about those.It should be a statutory condition for brutal regulations like these that ministers do their homework. They must present to Parliament an evidence-based cost-benefit analysis to justify what they are doing, together with a proper assessment of the alternatives. Advance contingency planning would make it possible to produce these quite quickly.Governments need to have powers to take decisive action in an emergency. But that should not mean inefficient, destructive and blinkered policy-making.     More from NewsLatest pictures from Ukraine: Russian troops have entered Kharkiv while the battle for Kyiv continuesUkraine-Russia: Volodymyr Zelensky responds to Kremlin on peace talks saying he will meet but not in Belarus\u0026#39We have been brought together for a reason\u0026#39, says Prince Harry of wife Meghan, Duchess of SussexMapped: Russia\u0026#39s invasion of UkraineSutton Hoo shipbuilder seeks donations of oak trees felled by storms to help build replicaUkraine highlights ethical value of the defence industry, says SercoMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"olaf scholz gave vladimir putin green light invade","story":"During the Second World War, Ukraine was a scene of armageddon: huge battles involving millions of casualties and appalling atrocities. Field Marshal Erich von Manstein, who commanded the German armies there during the decisive phase of the war, was both a military genius and a war criminal. His British admirers, including Winston Churchill, saw to it that he served only four years of an 18-year sentence for his crimes. Ukrainians are less forgiving, and the German military owes them a debt of honour.The polar opposite of the Nazi Wehrmacht, the West German Bundeswehr was once the front line of Nato’s defence against the Red Army. In the late Eighties, when I spent a few days with them while serving as The ’s Bonn correspondent, they impressed me by their professionalism. One officer taught me to shoot. That generation of German soldiers left me in no doubt that, if Soviet tanks came thundering through the Fulda Gap, the Bundeswehr would have stood and fought. They had the tanks, they had the men and they had the money, too.Now, evidently, they don’t. Germany is still the richest country in Europe, but its defence spending is just 1.36 per cent of GDP, far below the Nato target of 2 per cent. A post-Cold War pacifist culture of complacency has undermined military morale. Before moving to Brussels to preside over a series of fiascos as head of the EU Commission, Ursula von der Leyen was a notably undistinguished German defence minister. Her legacy was symbolised by the discovery that troops were so badly equipped that on Nato exercises, they were forced to use broomsticks as rifles.Even worse than this neglect of the bare necessities of a credible defence has been the all-pervasive pro-Russian attitude of the German elites, even within the military. This was epitomised when the Inspector of the German Navy, Vice-Admiral Kay-Achim Schönbach, was forced to resign after telling a think tank audience last month that the idea of a Russian invasion of Ukraine was “nonsense”. Putin, he said, merely wanted to be treated as an equal: “It is easy to give him the respect he really demands – and probably also deserves.” Crimea, he added, “is gone”, while Ukraine (and Georgia) should be kept out of Nato to placate Russia.After such a public endorsement of Putin, at a time of delicate negotiations with Moscow, caused dismay among allies and protests from Kyiv, Schönbach jumped before he was pushed. But his views are widely shared within a German political, diplomatic and business establishment that has become inured to Putin’s aggression and dependent on his gas.In particular, the Russian state energy company Gazprom has acquired a grip over German gas supplies that renders the country vulnerable to blackmail. The Green energy minister, Robert Habeck, admitted last week that Berlin had watched helplessly while Gazprom “systematically” held back supplies at the start of the winter, ensuring that by the time of the invasion, German reserves would be at an all-time low. Habeck is supposed to be in charge of energy security, yet he seems astonished that not only Germany’s gas supplies but also its reserves are, in effect, controlled by the Kremlin.Looking back over the Ukrainian debacle, who emerges as the guilty men and women? Leaving the Kremlin aside, high on the list of Western culprits come the last three German chancellors: Gerhard Schröder, Angela Merkel and Olaf Scholz.Especially when compared with their postwar predecessors – European statesmen such as Adenauer, Brandt, Schmidt and Kohl – this trio of mediocrities deserve to hang their heads in ignominy. By toadying to Putin, neglecting Nato and feeding the German addiction to Russian energy, each one has betrayed Ukraine and jeopardised Europe.The most obviously Russophile German leader was Gerhard Schröder, the Social Democrat chancellor from 1998 to 2005. The son of a Nazi soldier who was killed on the Eastern front, he internalised the guilt of his generation and has ended up as a Kremlin stooge Schröder went to work for Gazprom within weeks of leaving office. He has vigorously promoted the Nord Stream Baltic pipeline project, designed to increase Europe’s dependency on Russian energy. In recent months, Schröder has lobbied for Nord Stream 2, which would avoid the need to pump gas across Ukraine. In the face of Russian atrocities, Schröder has been conspicuous by his silence.His successor, Angela Merkel, dominated German and indeed European politics for 16 years, only stepping down last December. As an East German and a fluent Russian speaker, she showed a combination of deference and wariness towards Moscow. It was characteristic that Putin exploited her fear of dogs by bringing his huge black Labrador to their meeting in 2007.Disastrously, Mrs Merkel fed the German addiction to Russian gas by closing down the country’s nuclear industry. She worked hard to keep Germany as Russia’s biggest trading partner. While vocal on human rights, she was reluctant to do anything that might antagonise Putin, averse to sanctions after such outrages as the 2014 annexation of Crimea or 2018’s Salisbury poisonings.While enjoying the limelight as “the world’s most powerful woman”, Mrs Merkel utterly failed to complete the task of German reunification by inculcating Western values among her fellow East Germans, allowing both far-Left and far-Right parties to flourish. Lacking any discernible beliefs of her own, she presided over the transformation of Germany from the instinctively pro-Western country I remember from 40 or 50 years ago into the fence-sitting, soft-centred, moralistic yet mercenary society it now is.As finance minister in the Merkel coalition from 2018 until he succeeded her as Chancellor last year, Olaf Scholz was an enthusiastic supporter of this surreptitious appeasement of Putin. So it is no surprise that until this weekend he was one of the chief opponents of kicking Russia out of the Swift international payments system – a sanction that would really damage Putin’s prestige. Scholz has cut a pitiful figure on the diplomatic stage, refusing even to mention Nord Stream 2 while sitting next to Joe Biden and leaving it to the President to declare that the pipeline project was as good as dead, but he left it until the eve of the invasion to endorse the US position. The German company that has built Nord Stream will now be sanctioned – but only by the Americans. The assumption must be that Scholz’s foot-dragging is due to the persistent influence in his party of its former leader, Schröder.More from NewsUkraine-Russia: Volodymyr Zelensky responds to Kremlin on peace talks saying he will meet but not in Belarus\u0026#39We have been brought together for a reason\u0026#39, says Prince Harry of wife Meghan, Duchess of SussexMapped: Russia\u0026#39s invasion of UkraineSutton Hoo shipbuilder seeks donations of oak trees felled by storms to help build replicaUkraine highlights ethical value of the defence industry, says SercoLatest pictures from Ukraine: Russian troops have entered Kharkiv while the battle for Kyiv continuesMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"tutankhamuns curse dispelled oxford university exhibition","story":"The curse of Tutankhamun is to be dispelled once and for all by an exhibition at Oxford University in the spring, a hundred years after Howard Carter and Lord Carnarvon made their discovery of the young king’s tomb.Exhibits at the Bodleian Library will show that rumours of a curse actually existed long before Carnarvon’s untimely death on April 5 1923, which spread false reports of an ancient tablet warning that “death shall come on swift wings to him that toucheth the tomb of a Pharaoh”.Displayed for the first time will be a previously unpublished telegram sent to Carter months earlier, on Jan 13, by an unidentified mystic. Apparently responding to news that the excavation had been delayed by a sandstorm, she wrote of his need to placate angry spirits: “If trouble continues reseal tomb pour milk oil wine at threshold.”The telegram comes from an important archive of photographs, letters, plans, drawings and diaries that was originally created by the excavators and presented in 1945 after Carter’s death to the Griffith Institute, the centre of Egyptology at the University of Oxford.The exhibition, with an accompanying book titled Tutankhamun: Excavating the Archive, opens on April 13. It has been curated by Richard Bruce Parkinson, professor of Egyptology at the university, and Dr Daniela Rosenow, of the Griffith Institute.Prof Parkinson told the : “The curse doesn’t exist. It was propagated by an archaeologist excluded from the excavation team. It was taken up by every other person, including Arthur Conan Doyle, and fed into the myth of the mummy, that if you plunder the ancient body, the body will come and get you. It’s that Gothic horror thing, which was so well-established in the generation before the tomb’s discovery. When Carnarvon died the press let it out of the tomb, as it were, and it rampaged through the popular imagination.”He dismissed the relevance of reports that a scientist who X-rayed the mummy succumbed to a mysterious illness, that another member of the excavation team died of arsenic poisoning, and that a wealthy American died after visiting the tomb. Scientific studies have explored whether a pathogen had survived within the tomb.Prof Parkinson, a former Egyptology curator at the British Museum, said: “These deaths were coincidences. Carnarvon was in fact the only person to have died shortly after disturbing the tomb. The idea that everybody was dropping dead is simply non-existent. It really is an absurd fabrication.”He added: Carnarvon was the only one who died in a spectacularly untimely manner and that’s physically explainable. Ill-health was the reason he had first come to Egypt before.”On March 19 1923, Carnarvon suffered a mosquito bite which became infected by a razor cut. He died of blood poisoning.The exhibition will display letters that the Egyptologist Alan Gardiner wrote from Cairo to his wife, describing these “few ghastly days, worried to death with old Carnarvon’s illness”, and one written hours after his death: “I have been in the depths of despondency.”Dr Rosenow said that Carnarvon died aged 56, at a time when “the average life expectancy for men back then was 60”, and that Carter died in 1939, aged 64, from Hodgkin\u0027s disease. Among other members of the team, photographer Harry Burton died of diabetes in 1940, aged 60.A simple sandstormProf Parkinson said: “What startled me when I first saw the telegram was that I assumed it was to do with Carnarvon’s death. But it was sent before, right at the discovery of the tomb. The only thing it can possibly refer to was a simple sandstorm, which had stopped work. A sandstorm in the desert is not exactly unexpected or mystical, but clearly news of that reached the mystic who promptly sent Carter a telegram saying you have to placate the spirits. I don’t think it needs a curse to explain sand in the desert.”The latest research suggests that the mystic was Ella Young, an Irish poet and Celtic mythologist, who later wrote letters to Carter claiming that Carnarvon had died because the tomb had been opened.The curse became so well-established that in 1930, the British Museum’s keeper of Egyptian and Assyrian antiquities authorised the  to publish a statement: “As to the so-called inscription, ‘Death shall come on swift wings to him that toucheth the tomb of a Pharaoh’, no such inscription on the Royal or other tombs is known to me or to any Egyptologists.”The exhibition will reflect that although Carter also dismissed the curse as ‘tommy rot’, in 1923, he published a sensationalist, semi-fictional story ‘The Tomb of the Bird’, in which his canary dies from the bite of a cobra at the moment the English enter the tomb.More from News\u0026#39We have been brought together for a reason\u0026#39, says Prince Harry of wife Meghan, Duchess of SussexUkraine-Russia: Volodymyr Zelensky responds to Kremlin on peace talks saying he will meet but not in BelarusMapped: Russia\u0026#39s invasion of UkraineSutton Hoo shipbuilder seeks donations of oak trees felled by storms to help build replicaUkraine highlights ethical value of the defence industry, says SercoLatest pictures from Ukraine: Russian troops have entered Kharkiv while the battle for Kyiv continuesMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"sunday morning uk news briefing todays top headlines telegraph","story":"More from NewsUkraine-Russia: Volodymyr Zelensky responds to Kremlin on peace talks saying he will meet but not in Belarus\u0026#39We have been brought together for a reason\u0026#39, says Prince Harry of wife Meghan, Duchess of SussexMapped: Russia\u0026#39s invasion of UkraineSutton Hoo shipbuilder seeks donations of oak trees felled by storms to help build replicaUkraine highlights ethical value of the defence industry, says SercoLatest pictures from Ukraine: Russian troops have entered Kharkiv while the battle for Kyiv continuesMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"expert says britain should target","story":"Exclusive: Expert says Britain should target Vladimir Putins own wealth to really hit himUS Banker and anti-corruption activist Bill Browder says the crackdown should hit Vladimir Putins own wealth, , which is kept safe and sound in London by a handful of his oligarch stoogesBill Browder said the UK should target Vladimir Putins own wealth Image: AFP Getty ImagesByJack Clover:,  Feb |commentsThe man who devised the first sanctions list against Putin’s cronies says the latest UK efforts are “missing the target” – which should be the dictator himself. US Banker and anti-corruption activist Bill Browder says the crackdown should hit the Kremlin chief’s own wealth, which is kept safe and sound in London by a handful of his oligarch stooges.Mr Browder said: “ Vladimir Putin ’s a very selfish man. He doesn’t care about other people, so sanctioning people around him doesn’t affect him.“The only way is to hit his personal assets – and they are held by people known to us. We needed to make a list of top oligarchs two months ago and start hitting them five at a time, so he could see we are coming after his money. These men are well-known to us, they’re on the Forbes rich list and some of them even own football teams.” The UK has promised “imminent” sanctions on Putin and Mr Browder’s cautious remarks boost calls from Labour to sanction prominent iniduals – such as Cha’s Russian owner Roman Abramovich, who last night gave up the running of the west London club and transferred its “care and stewardship” to the trustees of Cha’s charitable foundation. Mr Browder made his fortune in Russia around the turn of the millennium. He was moved to fight for the first sanctions after his friend Sergei Magnitsky suffered an agonising death in a Russian jail in , aged , after questioning the powers that be.Mr Magnitsky, a lawyer, had accused Putin’s government of falsying documents as a pretext for throwing Mr Browder out of Russia. He died in prison after  months of being refused medication for his pancreatitis.  Mr Browder said: “My friend Sergei would be absolutely appalled right now. He was the face of all that Russia should have been. He was young, professional, ambitious and patriotic. He wanted the best for his country. He wanted an honest country.” His legacy – the Magnitsky Act – was passed by President Obama in  with the aim of targeting human rights abusers and corrupt officials in Russia.Mr Browder, like many across the world, has been shocked by the scale and violence of Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. He said: “Putin’s always cleverly played both sides, being a presentable member of G on one hand while organising assassinations in the heart of Salisbury at the same time.“He’s now destroyed that fine balance – he’s completely crossed the Rubicon.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Rubicon Ltd.Barack ObamaRoman AbramovichSergei MagnitskyVladimir PutinHuman rightsSunday People\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

He has been under US sanctions since  because of his close association with the Russian president. Now he has been banned from Britain and had his assets here frozen.He is also a director of and .% shareholder in Russia ’s largest privately owned gas company Novatek. Somerset Capital Management, set up by Mr Rees-Mogg before becoming an MP, invests £.million in Novatek on behalf of clients. Timchenko is also a major shareholder in Rossiya, one of the Russian banks sanctioned by the UK last week. He once told a Russian news agency: “You have to pay for everything in your le. Even for your friendship with the president.” Joshua Ausden of Somerset said he could not comment on specic companies. But he added: “ Jacob Rees-Mogg no longer works at Somerset Capital and has had no role in any of the firm’s investment decisions for over a decade.“Any partnership interest in Somerset is held in abeyance, in accordance with the ministerial code.” As a minister Mr Rees-Mogg, , is banned from playing any role in Somerset’s business affairs.

The Labour leader said: “The Government has got this one wrong. They are applying the same rules as they had before.”That means Ukrainian refugees who want to come here must apply for visas first. Sir Keir added: “We must help Ukrainian people looking for safety. That is what we have always done as a country in a moment like this.” Whitehall sources said a resettlement programme is being worked on but details have not been finalised. Yet Ireland has told Ukrainians fleeing their homes they are welcome and officials will worry about the paperwork later.  Justice minister Helen McEntee tweeted: ”We stand with the Ukrainian people and we will play our part in assisting them in their time of need.“That’s why I am immediately lting visa requirements between Ukraine and Ireland. This will apply to all Ukrainians.”The UK’s Visa Application Centre in Kyiv closed as the Russians invaded but entry visas are still available in Lviv where British Embassy staff relocated.

Russia predictably used its veto to block a resolution ordering it to withdraw all troops from Ukraine. And that has prompted calls to reform the  year old institution by removing the glue which keeps Russia fixed to the table. In a sign of Vladimir Putin ’s global isolation even his traditional ally China abstained. And that could signal change is about to come.Constitutionalist David Rogers said: “The UN’s founding fathers would be appalled at what just happened. “There should be nothing in the UN charter which stops the  member states voting to remove Russia as a permanent member.” When the UN was created from the ashes of World War II the five victors - Britain, America, France, the Soviet Union and China - were given all-time powers to veto anything they did not like. That system cannot work when one of them is the aggressor.Now Putin is in a bind. And intelligence chiefs fear he will use indiscriminate violence to speed up the advance delayed by Ukrainian fighters. One Western official said: “Now Putin has committed himself this is no longer a war of choice but necessity. He must win. And he will use any means necessary.” Defence minister James Heappey added: “You are going to see more utterly brutal fighting.” That could include thermobaric rockets, a chemical mix creating a supersonic blast which vaporises buildings and bodies. Their use would cause massive loss of civilian le. And could see Putin hauled to the Hague as a war criminal.

Minister James Cleverly said the Russians who donated to the Conservatives were fleeing PutinVladimir Putin addressing the nationopinionByMark Steel:,  Feb |comments One by one, British ministers made stern speeches that went: “We will be STRONG and RUTHLESS against Putin and evil Russian money.”This sounds convincing, because over the last few years we’ve been really strict with his oligarchs. To start with, we’ve allowed them to buy half the property in London, which must have caused them an absolute nightmare in getting surveys done and arranging removal vans. Maybe next week we’ll get even more serious and announce that when an oligarch buys a riverside apartment, they have to wait an extra day before receiving their parking permit. One of them, Lubov Chernukhin, donated millions to the Conservative Party and had a game of tennis with Boris Johnson. I suppose that now we’re being even tougher,she plays another game, Boris will hit the ball really hard.  Minister James Cleverly said the Russians who donated to the Conservatives were “fleeing Putin”. Maybe this is why the sanctions they first announced only affected five Russian banks and three Russian oligarchs. All the others are fleeing Putin. For example, Roman Abramovich, the Russian billionaire who bought Cha, is hiding in fear from Putin. Luckily he’s found an excellent place to hide, which is the directors’ box at Stamford Bridge, where I expect he’s writing a diary like Anne Frank. This includes harrowing words such as “I hear knock at door.  “My heart races. Is this Putin’s agents  I am lucky, the goalkeeper is happy as we have beat Barcelona.” The tough stance must also be why this government has worked so hard in stopping inflatable boats crossing the channel. Some of those refugees might be oligarchs from Russia and it’s essential we keep them out. But somehow they sneaked in by private jet and getting dual nationality and putting millions of rubles in our banks and donating to the Conservative Party, the wily rascals. So now we can relax that we’re in safe hands, such as Defence Secretary Ben Wallace who said: “We kicked the backside of the Russians in  in Crimea, we can do it again.” That’s the plan, is it  Maybe Ben will go out there himself to kick their backside like we did in .  He can take Jacob Rees-Mogg, who will tell us he’s already cleaned his musket and he’ll humiliate the Russians by challenging them to a Latin test. At this critical moment, this is who we have in charge. It would be more reassuringa BBC announcer said: “Now, to hear the latest on the alarming events in Ukraine, we’re going live to hear a statement from Bez, the dancer from the Happy Mondays.” Then he would explain “Right, yeah, there are like tanks and everything, you know, it’s like, heavy.” In any case, as soon as Boris Johnson said he’d be tough on Putin, it was certain that in  months we’ll see photos of Putin on the night of the invasion, having a beer with Liz Truss and Boris Johnson in the garden at No. Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Jacob Rees-MoggRoman AbramovichLiz TrussJames CleverlyBoris JohnsonAnne FrankBBCConservative PartyPrivate jetsPoliticsBillionairesRussia Ukraine warSunday Mirror\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

If you sell goods to the EU, or buy goods from the EU and bring them into the UK, you need to be able to prove that they meet the new rules of origin requirements to access preferential tarfs. It’s vital you understand the new rules to keep your business moving. To benefit from the preferential tarfs, you must have proof that any goods you import from the EU originate there, or any goods you export to the EU originate in the UK. Proof of origin can either be a statement of origin completed by the exporter, or evidence of the importer’s knowledge of where products originate. If you cannot prove the origin, you or your EU customer may be liable to pay the full rate of customs duty and could face penalties. Andrew Macleod, founder of London-based restaurant brand Emilia’s Crafted Pasta, explains that imports from the EU are vital to his brand: “We import ingredients directly from Italy, including special cured meats, cheeses, drinks and alcohol. Each of our suppliers is hand-picked.”  Has he had to make any changes to his business now that there are new import rules in place  “Yes – of course we already knew the origin of all the goods we import as we source everything carefully. But we’ve trained two of our managers on the rules around importing, so we know that we have staff in house who are well versed in the process.”  And having successfully navigated the changes, what advice would Andrew offer other businesses that import  “We found using a customs agent really helps the process run smoothly, but it’s equally important that you understand the rules yourself,” he says. “It’s not too late, and the gov.uk site has lots of valuable information.”  You must be able to prove the origin of any product you import You can choose to work with a freight forwarder or courier To benefit from preferential tarfs, you must be able to prove that any goods you import originated in the EU Note:you’re moving goods between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, rules of origin work dferently.

When Rose Grfiths, , collapsed at her job after suffering a stroke in August , she was shocked and devastated to wake up and discover she couldn’t speak.Doctors warned the mum of two and her daughters, Lisa, , and Kellie, , that she would never walk or talk again. A former typist, the news devastated Rose, who had previously tackled a daily crossword with ease and loved English at school. Determined to prove doctors wrong, the grandmother of two from Liverpool, Merseyside put every effort into teaching herself to read, write and speak again.But when the words finally came to her she was shocked to hear she spoke with a Russian accent instead of her usual soft Scouse twang.Have you got an incredible story to tell  Email webnews@mirror  Frustrated by this and her inability to say whatever she wanted, Rose started to feel isolated and was left in a dark place.Rose told The Mirror : “I opened my mouth to try to speak but nothing came out.“It was terrible, it’s the most horrible feeling trying to speak and not being able to. “When I finally started talking, the consultant told me I was speaking with a Russian accent. “People were telling me I sounded Russian, Eastern European or German but I couldn’t hear it because to me I was just speaking normally.  “I want to talk the way I always did, because that’s who I am, it’s very frustrating. ‘One gentleman was talking to me and he said I sounded Eastern European so he asked me ‘where do you come from ’ “I told him ‘from here’ and walked away. “I felt so annoyed because it doesnapost matterI sound Russian or anything  because I’m not.” Four weeks after her stroke, as Rose continued to struggle speaking fluent English, a doctor suggested she try to sing instead. She initially dismissed the idea, but after giving it a go she was stunned to hear her voice project clearly and beautully a full sentence or lyric with ease. She said: “When I sang for the first time, it felt marvellous. “I felt like I was finally regaining some power back over my voice. “I can’t speak fluently but I can sing a full song perfectly. “When I go to choir they talk as much as I sing. “My daughters come to watch me perform and it makes them very emotional, they are proud of me.”Now Rose sings every week with The Brain Charity’ s choir. Starting as a volunteer at the charity five years ago, it has become a safe haven for Rose to speak with other people with a brain injury or condition who can relate to her own experience. Today she also works in the cafe, which is often the first place someone visiting the Liverpool-based hub may come to, after their own experience with a le-changing brain injury or event. She said: “I want to help people feel better and know that things do get better.“ The Brain Charity has been like heaven for me, so when people come here and tell me they can’t speak I tell them, ‘why don’t you sing ’“People say ‘oh I can’t sing’ but it doesn’t matter what you sound like, it’s about using your voice.” In the last four weeks, Rose has been able to make more progress than she ever has in the previous seven years, thanks to a new speech and language therapist working with the charity. Kellyann Lea is a new addition to the organisation alongside a brand new ‘neurogym’ thanks to an anonymous £, donation from a late former service-user. Tui Benjamin-Thorp, Head of Communications and Fundraising at The Brain Charity said: “When I first met Rose, because of the pandemic, she found it much more dficult because she hadnapost been talking.If you donapost use it, thereaposs a danger you can lose it. I think what is really frustrating for people with aphasia is that you can still see the sentences fully formed in your head but it’s the connection between your brain and your mouth getting it out which can be affected. A lot of peoplethey have had a brain condition which affects their speech or communication they might not want to leave the house, go to the shops or anything where they have to talk. We often take being able to talk for granted but it can really impact what you can do day to day which is why we try to make The Brain Charity a really safe welcoming space for everyone.

Now, they are earning a fortune through OnlyFansCharlotte, , and Bear, , at their home in Gloucestershire Image: Reach CommissionedByDave BurkeSenior News Reporter:,  Feb Updated:,  Feb |commentsA couple whose businesses were decimated by Covid are jetting off for a new le in the sun after raking in thousands each month sharing X-rated videos online. Neighbours in their leafy Cotswolds village are oblivious to how the raunchy husband and we, who have five children, have turned their fortunes around.The pair, who go by the names Charlotte, , and Bear, , were forced to apply for Universal Credit after the salon and construction firm they ran were wiped out by the pandemic. Struggling to pay the bills, they decided to share videos of themselves having sex on subscriber  OnlyFans, and now have a lucrative army of subscribers.Charlotte and Bear now plan to move their family to Greece so they can continue their new occupation in the sunshine.  Charlotte told The Mirror: “We worked all our lives for our businesses, but then the pandemic came along and decimated them. “I had to make redundancies, it was awful. This is a lot more fun for us.” They now upload new videos and images every day and say they were pleased by the response, now making upwards of £, a month. In spite of their success, they said close friends and family were surprised by their new line of work. Charlotte, nicknamed Chots, said: “We were in a position where we applied for Universal Credit, but that’s a long wait when you’re not earning money. “We’ve always had an active sex le, and it’s something we started joking about. At first we thought we’d give it a whirl, it’s something we enjoy doing.” Their hundreds of subscribers may be familiar with them getting saucy in the bedroom, but Charlotte said her neighbours would be shocked. “We live in a quintessential English village, I think they’d have kittensthey knew,” she said. “They’d think ‘no way, they’re not like that, they’re really normal’. We’re quite homely people really.” The mum-of-five said at first it was nerve-wracking sharing their intimate moments with complete strangers, but described the response as “amazing”.  “There were mixed emotions, but people seem to like it, we don’t always take it too seriously and to be honest it’s quite fun,” she said. “We’ve now got lots of subscribers and we have to work hard to keep them. We’re turning it from being a side-hustle to making it a full-time job, we’ve got to put the effort in there.” Charlotte and Bear run two accounts on OnlyFans, with each having around  subscribers paying £. a month. On top of that, inidual users can ask them to make customised videos, for which they pay upwards of £ a minute. Although they’ve told some close friends and family members, most of those around them have no idea about their new income stream - and their children have no idea. “At first there was a bit of shock obviously, and there were a few questions about how it would work,” Charlotte said. “But they thought as long we’re not having complications or bringing in other people, which we’ll never do, it’s ok, they just tell us to stay safe.” But as it is a protected  with age verication, she said she is not worried about their kids stumbling on raunchy footage. “I don’t think it’s something we’ve got to have a discussion with them about,” she said. And she said it has brought the couple - who have known each other since they were teenagers growing up in the Cotswolds - even closer together. “We thought will it interfere with our marriage, but it hasn’t at all, we’ve found it’s a lot of fun.” On Monday they plan to leave the UK behind and jet off to a new le in Greece. “We’re embracing our next adventure, we love travel and prefer warm climates, and we can create content wherever we are. “We’re not making millions, butwe do get a new iant we’re lockdown proof and it’s something we enjoy.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON LoveTeenagersDaily MirrorCoronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus briefing with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Andrea Sunshine religiously works out for a minimum of three hours a day – and has earned an incredible toned physique in the process. The single grandmother-of-two warms up with an hour of cardio before she starts hitting the weights, which she says is like visiting her very own Disneyland. Divorced Andrea, , from London says she doesnapost entertain men while working out as it upsets her strict routine, which involves at least three hours-a-day in the gym and has been known to go on for a whole eight hours. And her commitment hasnapost gone to waste, as she has competed against women half her age in physique competitions, achieving a hat-trick of finishing in the top five.  People call me a beast,” Andrea said. Young men have a crush on good looking mature ladies so I get hit on all the time. There’s all kind of ages, thereaposs even some below  but most are between -.  I donapost like the attention. When I am on my session I hate to be disturbed. It doesnapost bother me to be called a fitness grandma – I am in my best shape and infinitely healthy. There is a stigma that with advancing age of women, they should only dedicate themselves to taking care of the home and family. Itaposs possible to do both.Andrea, who has dual Dutch-Brazilian nationality, swears by a healthy diet which sees her munching on broccoli daily alongside a tonne of vegetables with protein, sometimes reaching , calories. But she steers away from sweet vegetables as well as salt and oil to keep herself trim. The professional trainer and athletics coach not only teaches physical exercises to keep herself trim but is a great advocate for spiritual therapy too. She added: The mind has a very great power to transform our body, we cannot leave the mind aside.  I go to the gym every single day, exceptI am injured or am very sore from the previous session. To help other women, she posts her balanced exercise and healthy eating routine to her , followers on social media @andrea__sunshinee Andrea said: I always start with cardio – I can’t have a good performance without it – spinning is my favourite though.It depends of my daily routine and resistance, I try to spare enough time for, but on average I go for three hours. Sometimes it is five hours non-stop. My record has been eight hours but with breaks for some nutrition. And she says the key to keeping fit is a healthy diet, which she splits between six to eight meals throughout the day. Andrea said: I eat broccoli the most. But other key vegetables are green beans, little corn, eggs whites, caullower, yam, cabbage and spinach.I try to avoid sweet vegetables, like carrots and pumpkin. The only one I eat is sweet potatoes. Also drinking water is crucial. I drink at least - litres.

He was in a hotel room working on production of a film that was to become one of the greatest of all time. The Godfather– which premiered  years ago this month – was set to thrill millions worldwide, charting the bloody rise of a Mafia family.But the anonymous voice on the line had other ideas – and a chilling message for Robert. “Take some advice,” it growled. “We don’t want to break your pretty face, hurt your newborn. Get the f*** out of town. “Don’t shoot no movie about the family here. Got it ” Get all the latest news sent to your inbox.for the free Mirror newsletter  It was just one of a series of chilling attempts to scupper Francis Ford Coppola’s iconic film based on Mario Puzo’s  novel about the troubled Corleone crime family. But in a remarkable twist of fate, the Mob was to end up backing the project – after a real-le godfather made the producer an offer he couldn’t refuse in a secret meeting: Drop the word ‘Mafia’ from the script and let some of our wise guys help out on the set.It led to an authenticity that was to make the movie starring Marlon Brando and Al Pacino a colossal hit. From the very beginning, maker Paramount had wanted The Godfather to be directed by an Italian-American. A string of cinema titans were offered the job, including Sergio Leone, creator of the Spaghetti Western genre. Then along came Coppola, stone broke at the time – the perfect match to work on the screenplay alongside author Puzo, who was himself deep in gambling debt. The pair hoped to make a movie that would dig them out of their respective financial holes while staying faithful to Italian-American culture.  But as the film that would gather Oscars began to take shape, the boss of New York’s most powerful crime family began to take an interest in what was going on. Joseph Colombo was a loan shark, tax evader, and gambling magnate. He was also the founder of the Italian-American Civil Rights League, an organisation with , members which set out to improve the image of Italian-Americans.  He didn’t want Paramount shining a light on his dark corner of the underworld and he so used the League – effectively the PR arm of the Mafia – to wage war against the studio. At first there were thinly veiled threats about labour issues. An enforcer arrived in Hollywood offering Paramount a million dollars to scrap the project. Workers connected to the film threatened to strike, expensive equipment mysteriously went missing, and location scouts in a New York borough found locals unwilling to co-operate.Then came the sinister phone call to Paramount’s production chief Robert Evans, threatening his we and baby. Al Ruddy, the film’s producer, was another Mob target. His car windows were shot out and a note was left on the dashboard telling him to shut down the movie. The police warned he was being tailed, and bomb threats were made at ­Paramount’s parent company, Gulf  Western, prompting two evacuations. For months, frightened Ruddy kept a gun in his desk drawer.  Then early in , he warily agreed to a meeting with Colombo. The Mobster handed him his “offer”. Out went the word Mafia and in came some of Colombo’s “associates” as extras in the film. Coppola made a point of ignoring them, but the Mobsters were said to be enthralled, hanging around on set: sipping coffees, adjusting their ties, and offering advice. And as part of the deal Ruddy promised to donate proceeds from the premiere to Colombo’s Italian-American Civil Rights League.In , the League made a public announcement that The Godfather was being filmed with Colombo’s blessing. But there was more trouble ahead. Gulf  Western, Paramount’s conglomerate owner, was furious to find out an employee was effectively making deals with the Mob. Stock prices plunged and Ruddy was fired, only to be re-hired shortly after at Coppola’s insistence – although the donation to the League was quietly scrapped. Ruddy would later say: “Without the Mafia’s help, it would have been impossible to make the picture.” And what a picture. The Corleones’ turf wars spawned a trilogy of films and inspired modern shows like The Sopranos, also helping change attitudes to race, immigration and the American Dream.  Critics believe that in the last  years The Godfather has soaked into our culture like horse blood soaks into bedsheets and has aged as well as a fine Italian wine. “It was a turning point in film-making in so many ways,” says Dom Foulsham, film and TV lecturer and co-founder of UKfilmNet. “The movie’s lasting appeal lies with the mix of fascination, attraction and terror, and the complexity of characters who were believable yet flawed, sinister yet deeply human.” James Caan, who plays the impulsive Sonny, studied the mannerisms of the gangsters lurking behind the cameras so he could better represent them on his side of the lens.  The result was a crime film so authentic that Mobsters thought of it as their own home movie. The term Godfather had been invented by Puzo, but the film’s influence was so huge that real Mafiosi were soon using it. Colombo, for his part, had a nasty twist in store. He was gunned down by rival Joe Gallo on June , , just a few blocks from where Coppola was filming. The Mafia chief spent seven years in a coma before his death in . But the real-le shooting only helped to raise The Godfather’s profile. Upon its American release on March ,  people queued for hours to see it.  The only people who didn’t have to wait were the mobsters invited by Ruddy to a special screening as thanks for their “co-operation”. Salvatore Gravano of New York’s Gambino crime family was particularly taken with the film. “Maybe it was fiction, but for me, then, that was our le,” he has said. “I remember talking to a multitude of guys, made guys, who felt exactly the same way.” At the th Academy Awards, The Godfather duly won Best Picture. Brando won Best Actor, and Coppola and Puzo shared Best Adapted Screenplay. Film expert Dom says we all love The Godfather’s characters as they “didn’t fit the Hollywood playbook of good and bad”. He says: “After The Godfather, crime films like Serpico, The French Connection and Training Day would forever owe their DNA to a cinematic landmark that still today fascinates and beguiles audiences in equal measure.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Al PacinoThe MafiaSunday Mirror,callToAction:ltpgtGet weekly highlights from Mirror editor Alison Phillips direct to your emaillt pgt,buttonText:,contentId:,newsletterImage:https:i-prod.mirror article.ece ALTERNATES sd _AlisonHeaderFinal.png,endpointUrl:https:response.pure interface list.php,profile:Reach_Mirror,isPureNewsLetter:true,pureMailingListId:Mirror - Alisons Newsletter,isDoubleOptIn:,newsletterSiteName:Mirror\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get weekly highlights from Mirror editor Alison Phillips direct to your emailInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Undoubtedly the superior element of the Full English, they are also found in animal-themed dinners like pigs in blankets, toads in holes and hotdogs. But making sure you choose the right banger could be the dference between making and breaking your meal. For many, Richmond is unquestionably the best, having become a firm favourite on Brit dinner plates for decades.  Kent Live reporter Sam Honey decided to put some supermarket -own brand offerings up against the supreme banger to seethere were any on the market that could compete.Supermarket own brands are often a great, and sometimes better, substitute to some of those weekly favourites, and are often cheaper. Sam visited Aldi, Tesco and Sainsbury’s to see which brand of pork sausage deserves a permanent spot in all future fry-ups. Richmond  To start the comparison, Sam went with the one that seemingly the most popular in order to get a basis to compare against. He prepped all of the sausages in the exact same way with a quick blast in the oven for half an hour with a turn halfway through the cooking time. He said he was not all too surprised when it came to taste, being a brand heaposd eaten on countless occasions. The distinct porky flavour with a texture that, while a little on the chewier side, is still very satisfying When it came to price this was, unsurprisingly, the most expensive of these selection, costing £. for the pack I bought. Now time to see how the supermarket alternatives compare. Aldi First out of the oven and onto my plate was Aldi, the place to shop when looking to grab those weekly necessities on a budget.Costing just £., this was the cheapest of the day but an initial taste test helped me to see why. Immediately, the drop in quality was noticeable, the meat tasted much cheaper and the overall flavour was weaker and seemed to vanish in an instant. The texture wasnapost horric, but a littlespongy, perhaps this brand would work better fried but for now I was definitely disappointed. So, in the interest of saving some cash this might be the best way to go, your taste buds just might not thank you for it. Tesco  Tesco often delivers great value alongside equally great quality, sadly this wasnapost the case when it came to their sausages. This was definitely the worst of the bunch when it came to both flavour and texture. The flavour was bland and borderline non-existent, while the texture was incredibly rubbery and hard to bite into. n terms of price, this packet cost £., so almost smack bang in the middle between the other two choices so far, and either would definitely be preferably. If youaposre looking for a better alternative to Richmond, this isnapost it. Sainsburyaposs  The final competitor of the day, only one shot remains to over throw the leading name brand. To my surprise, Sainsburyaposs absolutely delivered and then some, providing a delicious,not better alternative. The texture was perfect, and the flavours much fuller and tastier, leaving a long lasting impression. I would go so far as to say this was better than Richmond, and by a country mile, while also at a lower price. This pack cost me £. also, delivering better quality than not just Tesco, but in my opinion Richmond as well. Verdict Of these choices there was an absolute clear winner, Sainsburyaposs absolutely knocked it out of the park, beating not just their supermarket competitors, but the leading name brand also. Aldi wasnapost the best when it came to quality, but the price does definitely add appeal. Tesco unfortunately was rather disappointing and at the exact same price, Sainsburyaposs is the clear winner. So, when youaposre putting together that morning fry up to get you right and ready for the day, consider a trip to the local Sainsburyaposs for your sausage supply, Iaposm sure theyaposll go great in a sandwich too.

But the pair began a two-year romance, kept alive through letters, phone calls and a handful of visits. Kate says: “Guenther and I were first loves – he was the first man I slept with, the first man I ever cared about. “We were love’s young dream. I felt I’d met my soulmate, and so did he.” Guenther flew back to the UK twice the following year to stay with art student Kate, and she joined him and his family for two weeks that October.

She says: “I had great friends, loved my job and consigned myself to be happily single.”But when the pandemic hit and all her work stopped in the second lockdown, Kate began feeling low. She said: “It was November . I decided to get my Christmas decorations out to cheer myself up. “I pulled down a box from my wardrobe and out poured Guenther’s love letters – about  of them. My heart skipped a beat and all my old feelings flooded back.” She put the letters in date order, poured a glass of wine and spent the night curled up reading them.

You are the sun that makes me feel that I live.” One poem to her says: “The smell of your body in the morning, your hair lying gently on the pillow, a little smile in your yawning, your eyes like a mirror, touching your body with my lips, all I want is you, on my face your fingertips, I wish it could now be true.” On her one visit, Kate left Guenther her camisole top, doused in her perfume. He would hold it each time he wrote to her. Even after they broke up, he wrote of the fading smell of her perfume. Kate said: “Reading all these letters, I felt an enormous sense of loss – of the greatest love of my le, and of what could have been. “It was so clear how much we loved one another. When I got to the letter where it said the smell of the perfume is fading, it was very poignant. I needed to know where the man I had loved this much was now. I needed to see him.” But Guenther was not on social media, so Kate wrote to his brother Andreas, whose address she still had. Days later, she got a call from a German number. Holding back tears, she answered… and heard his voice. Kate says: “I recognised it at once, and his laugh. In seconds, it was like the last  years never happened. “I felt like a giddy teenager. All I wanted was to tell him I loved him – and always had. It took just a week before we both said ‘I love you’.” After eight weeks of daily video calls, Guenther flew to the UK. Kate said: “We hugged straight away – and the moment we got in my car at the airport we enjoyed our first kiss and cuddle for over  years.” Guenther, who works in IT, revealed he had tried tracing Kate under her maiden name but got nowhere. He said: “I only gave up a month before. Suddenly my brother handed me this letter. I was overwhelmed – and even more so when I saw her again. I remember it was a really sunny day and I thought, ‘She’s made the sun shine for me again’. “When we met it was amazing, she was an even better version of herself. She is so caring, thoughtful and strong-minded.” Guenther worked from Yorkshire for three months as they rekindled the relationship. He then ed home for work and to see family and his three grown-up children. In August he proposed on the same mountain they had climbed as youngsters. Kate said: “It was the best moment of my le. “He pulled champagne and a beautul diamond ring from his backpack and got down on one knee, declaring, ‘Distance couldn’t keep us apart, time couldn’t keep us apart. Please be my we’. Of course I said ‘yes’ at once.” They wed in December in Guenther’s home town of Unterwössen, and will have a UK ceremony in September. Kate said: “We walked in to George Michael’s version of The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face. It summed up our story. “We both shed a tear, but he was much worse than me! Now we just want a peaceful happy ever after at the foot of the mountain. I can’t believe we were apart  years.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON LoveSunday MirrorCoronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

It will not be possible simply to sanction the oligarchs, and hope they will go away.A demonstrator holds a sign depicting the Russian president as Adolf Hitler and reading Stop Putin during a protest against Russias military operation in Ukraine, in Barcelona Image: AFP via Getty ImagesopinionByOliver Bullough:,  Feb |comments I once asked a Russian friend why oligarchs love keeping their money in London and his reply, delivered with a laugh, was enlightening. He told me: “You know those movies when the Chicago mobsters want a break from fighting each other and go to Florida to relax  London is their Miami.”Sure, the weather in London may not be as cheery as in the sunshine state. But the services we have offered oligarchs are equivalent to those once used by the likes of Al Capone. Banks move their money around. Lawyers defend their assets and their reputations. Politicians hear their complaints. And we have lots of property and luxury goods, all available to the highest bidder. This has been convenient for members of the Kremlin’s elite. For while they are very good at stealing companies, invading sovereign nations, poisoning dissidents and shutting down the free media, they are not so hot at navigating the complexities of the international financial system. Get all the latest news sent to your inbox.for the free Mirror newsletter  This is where London professionals have come in. They have done all the back office work – minimising taxes, creating shell companies, laundering money. All of which allows oligarchs to concentrate on their core activity of looting Russia. And in the same way that Miami police officers were encouraged to look the other way when the mobsters came to town, our own law enforcement agencies have been under-funded and demoralised. Even the head of the National Crime Agency, when asked why she didn’t pursue more oligarchs, told a committee of MPs: “We are, bluntly, concerned about the impact on our budget, because these are wealthy people.” This has been highly profitable for the City of London. And for two decades or so, politicians have been very happy to protect those profits from any challenge. When, for example, a group of MPs attempted to close a loophole in Companies House through which tens of billions of pounds had secretly flowed out of Russia, the Treasury defended it, saying it needed to protect the competitiveness of the City of London. Now, however, is a watershed moment in so many ways.  With ruthless and merciless Vladimir Putin on the march, Britain needs to confront its role in enabling his regime’s development. It will not be possible simply to sanction the oligarchs, and hope they will go away. Their wealth has been too well laundered, too deeply embedded into our economy. The ownership of almost , properties in England and Wales is hidden behind anonymous offshore companies – and that is just the start of the problem. You cannot sanction someoneyou can’t see what they own, and you can’t sanction propertyyou can’t see who owns it.This crisis must be a wake-up call that, firstly, it is wrong to serve a regime that invades its neighbours, and crushes democracysecondly, that it is criminally irresponsible to let mobsters buy up large chunks of our capital city behind anonymous shell companies and thirdly, we need to attack corruptly owned wealth as fiercely as its owners defend it. And that means resourcing the police, so they can tackle the oligarchs who have enjoyed themselves here for too long. Here’s an example of “red carpet Britain” gone mad. In the run-up to the  revolution in Kyiv, Ukrainian oligarch Dmitry Firtash made a fortune selling Russian gas to Ukraine and Europe.  The Americans were suspicious of his business ties, investigated him, and he’s now battling extradition to the US after being arrested in Vienna on corruption charges. Our country, however, approached things rather dferently. We sold him a mansion , showed him around Parliament, got him to open trading on the Stock Exchange, asked him for advice on how to deal with Putin, and treated him like an honoured visitor. Oligarchs don’t stop being oligarchs just because they’ve got off a plane at Heathrow. They dislike democracy and free speech here, just as much as they do at home. For the good of ourselves, and for the good of Ukraine, we need to find a better way of making a living than being a mob banker.

WalesOnline reports that the Crown Prosecution Service released the video with with the permission of the victimaposs family.Roberts, , then lost control of his car and crashed into a telegraph pole and a wall.The vehicle landed on its roof and Lewis Morgan was killed. Roberts of Ammanford, Wales was found guilty of death by dangerous driving this week following a trial at Swansea Crown Court. The jury heard he had drunk at least five pints of cider at a country pub near Llandeilo in the hours before the crash. He also drank more lager after leaving the pub, and sipped from a bottle of Coors - that he had stopped to buy from a shop as he drove away.  Roberts admitted he was over the limit at the time of the crash and that he was speeding, both on the A and through the village of Blaenau where the fatal collision occurred. His defence barrister tried to convince the jury that the cause of the crash was a momentary lapse in concentration due to being distracted, rather than the result of excess alcohol and speeding. The jury took just over an hour toa unanimous guilty verdict. Judge Christopher Vosper QC adjourned the case for a pre-sentence report and Roberts will be sentenced at a later date.  In the days following the crash, Mr Morganaposs family paid tribute to a thoughtful, considerate and helpful young man”. In a statement they said: Lewis is our loving son, brother, grandson, nephew, cousin and friend and he will be missed by us all. Words cannot express how devastated we are by his untimely death and the overwhelming feeling of heartache and grief that we now feel. “Lewis was a thoughtful, considerate and helpful young man, who wore his heart on his sleeve. He truly lived le to the full and loved spending quality time with his family, friends and dogs.  “Lewis was always the le and soul of every party. We will forever cherish his infectious laughter, witty dance moves and his cheeky smile. Lewis lived for adventure. He relished spending time outdoors, camping and off-road biking. As a youngster, Lewis was a keen rugby player. “We would like to thank everyone who has rushed to put their arms around us to support us at this dficult time. Lewis is well known in and around Carmarthen and will be greatly missed by the many people whose lives he has touched.

According to MyLondon, that lean into the window at McDonalds, with phone in hand, could mean you are breaking this rule.On top of this, tougher mobile phone laws are set to be brought in next month. On March , tougher laws are set to be brought in to cover things like unlocking your device and accessing any application on your phone. This could mean drivers in drive-thrus could be subject to tougher rules in the future. The current law bans drivers from making a call and texting while driving but the changes on March  will cover most scenarios including accessing the internet or taking photosOn the tougher rules being brought in next month, Edmund King, AA president, said: “The AA has long campaigned to toughen up these rules, and we welcome this announcement. This is a much needed upgrade of the law to help make our roads safer. Mobile phones offer many distractions and this sends a clear message that picking them up to use them will not be tolerated. The law will also become tougher as the use of smartwatches, tablets and laptops behind the wheel will apply.Drivers will be extremely limited on when they can pick up their phone, mainly to call the emergency services when there was no opportunity to safely pull over and to make contactless payments at drive-thrus.

Dawn Ashford-Williams had lunch at Pizza Hut and enjoyed a catch-up with her sister-in-laws. But after ing to her vehicle in the car park in Wrexham, Wales, she noticed a handwritten note on her windscreen which warned her about the air pressure in one of her tyres. She immediately checked and sorted it out and was relieved someone was looking out for he.The mum also took to Facebook to post her thanks, reports North Wales Live.Dawn,  said: “I took a look, straight away,”  “It wasn’t completely flat but it was flat enough to think I may have a puncture, so I drove straight to a garage to put some more air in the tyre.” As Dawn had the tyres checked a few days previously, she suspects her car may have suffered a slow puncture en route to Pizza Hut. It left her relieved that someone had stepped in to prevent a potentially serious accident. “To be honest, I don’t check the tyres all the time and I may not have noticed the problem for a couple of days,” she said. “Who knows, I could have had a major blow-out on the way home, or got stranded in the middle of nowhere with the kids in the back. “Whoever they were, they may have saved me from a serious accident or something.” At the time, Dawn was driving home with son Kian, nine, and nephew Connor, eight, who had also dined at Pizza Hut. Wanting to thank her Good Samaritan, but lacking the means to do it personally, she turned to Facebook to express her gratitude.  She said: “There’s a lot of good people out there. I’ve seen Facebook posts where people have found wallets and mobile phones, but never one for this kind of thing. “So I just thought I’d write something, saying thank you,by any chance they saw my message. “I just wanted to show some positivity for a change.” Responding to her post, another motorist said a similar thing happened to her last summer. A mystery car angel left a similar note on her windscreen.

And she feared he was monitoring her after he kept showing up at the same places as herNicola Robinson feared her ex was monitoring her Image: SWNSByKatie PearsonAmy SharpeNews Reporter:,  Feb A mum has told of her horror when she found her violent ex was spying on her using a camera hidden in her wardrobe. Jamie Robinson had attacked Nicola twice after they split last July, leaving her terried. And she feared he was monitoring her after he kept showing up at the same places as her. Police found the Google Nest – designed to record audio and visual for home security – after searching her house in October. Nicola, , said: “I was so shocked. I don’t know when he managed to fit the devices but he filmed numerous day-to-day conversations I had with friends and family.  “I fell out with friends because things they had told me in confidence were being spread around. I didn’t feel like I could trust anyone. It was incredibly isolating.” Robinson, , was jailed for four years at Northampton magistrates court last month after he admitted attacking and stalking her. She said: “It’s upsetting to know I spent nine years with someone who would do this to me. “He tried to make me fall out with my friends by blaming them for telling him things but it was actually him listening in the whole time.” Nicola, a support worker, met tattooist Robinson through friends during a night out in August . The pair wed in November , and had a son. But things soured as he began staying out late and being cagey about his whereabouts. In July Nicola ordered him to go and he punched her in the back of the head. Nine days later, he ed at am, asked her where she had been and throttled her.  Police arrested him but soon afterwards he started turning up unexpectedly – one time following her to a hotel where she was staying with a friend and checking into the room next door. He knocked on their door, leaving her stunned. “I couldn’t believe he was there, and I immediately ran down to reception,” Nicola said. “We were moved to a dferent room, but I was really worried he’d come back.” In October, Nicola told a police officer at her home of her fears Robinson was tracking her. They searched for a camera but found nothing. “I said I needed to dash off to school and Jamie turned up at the school gates,” she said. “He asked me why I let the officer go upstairs and I knew he’d heard my conversation.” Police eventually located the camera in her bedroom wardrobe. Investigating officer PC Thomas Rosignoli described Robinson as “an extremely calculating and manipulative inidual”. Nicola said she was relieved by his jail sentence and hopes to help other women in similar circumstances. She added: “I haven’t dated anyone yet, my headspace is just not there yet. “My main priority is getting myself better and to a stable place.” The Sunday People has campaigned for a stalkers’ register to track serial perpetrators.

The space rock will zoom past Earth at almost , miles per hour, according to their calculations.It is estimated size makes it much bigger than the worldaposs tallest building, Burj Khala which stands at , ft in Dubai, and almost four times bigger than The Shard at around , ft in London. NASA spotted the asteroid via its database of NEO Earth Close Approaches.  The US space agency has classied it as a near-Earth object and believes it will reach its closest point to Earth at .am on Friday March . But it will not pose any danger to people on Earth as it will still be more than three million miles away at its nearest point. This is estimated to be around . Lunar Distance which means it will be more than  times further away than the moon.  There is also a chance that the asteroid is not as large as its upper estimate due to a wide margin for error in the calculations. But the lower estimate would still be large, coming in bigger than Americaaposs Empire State Building. The magnitude of the asteroid is recorded at .H which refers to the visual magnitude an observer would recordit were placed  Astronomical Unit away. It was first found in February  by the Lincoln Near-Earth Asteroid Research project in New Mexico, USA, and last seen near Earth in February .  The rock has been approaching the planet on an almost yearly basis and is due to come back again next February and April. An astronomer managed to photograph the  CB rock at the end of January as it moved towards Earth from more than . million miles away. The same astronomer recently captured the asteroid once more as it moves closer. It can also be seen moving through space via a time-lapse video made from  images captured while it was being observed.  Astronomer Gianluca Masi used a telescope to photograph the asteroid on Wednesday when it was approximately about . million miles away.He told Newsweek : The advanced technology we use makes our telescopes among the best ones on the planet to track and share even the fastest, demanding asteroids.The expert told how people often query why the number of near-Earth objects has supposedly increased in recent years. Actually, it is the continuously improving technology which is making it possible for us to spot smaller and smaller objects which we were simply missing before, he added.

Andrew was stripped of his other titles amid the furore over sex allegationsPrince Andrew is said to be broken Image: AFP via Getty ImagesByPatrick HillNews Reporter:,  Feb Prince Andrew is “broken” ­following his legal settlement with his sex accuser, sources claim. The Duke of York is said to be in such low spirits he has been allowed to keep the title of Vice Admiral to cheer him up. Andrew was stripped of his other titles amid the furore over allegations that he had sex with a trafficked teenager in London – which he strenuously denies. The rank of Vice Admiral, equivalent to an Army Lieutenant General, is now his only armed forces honorary title. A source who served with him during the Falklands War said: “He is down, he is broken. If he wants to dress up once in a while in a naval unorm, then let him.”  Our source added of Andrew: “He was actually not a bad person when I knew him. He had a few entitlement issues but that is to be expected. “His reputation is in tatters, his public le is over. He is a walking embarrassment. “Frankly, my view is let him keep the rank of Vice Admiral. He served in the Royal Navy in the Falklands War and this was bestowed upon him by the Queen. It’s effectively the same as an honorary degree. “He hasn’t been convicted of anything. I have no idea whether he is guilty or innocent, so I think he has paid quite a heavy price.” Andrew, , was in the Navy for  years and saw active service in the Falklands War as a helicopter pilot. It is understood the Queen allowed him to remain a Vice Admiral. The Duke was stripped of his other titles earlier this year following claims he sexually assaulted Virginia Giuffre when she was  – a claim he strongly denies. They were allegedly introduced by paedophile US financier Jeffrey Epstein and his now jailed ex, Ghislaine Maxwell. The Prince faced a civil case in New York but earlier this month reached an out of court settlement with Ms Giuffre, , said to be worth over £million.

Kate, the new patron of the Rugby Football Union, and William, patron of the Welsh Rugby Union since , showed their support for the opposing teams, donning England and Wales scarves for the Six Nations clash. The Queen recently gave Kate the RFU and Rugby Football League patronages, roles formerly held by the Duke of Sussex before he quit royal duties in .During her first engagement earlier this month with members of the England teams, Kate said of her rivalry with William: “We’re terribly competitive. The fact we’re now supporting two dferent teams is going to make things interesting.” She also revealed that Prince George, , Princess Charlotte, , and Prince Louis, , were “all enjoying” playing rugby, with Louis adopting a “kamikaze” style of play with his siblings.  Before the match, William,  and Kate,  were welcomed to the stadium by Jeff Blackett, president of the RFU and Gerald Davies, president of the Welsh Rugby Union. William wore a navy suit and clutched a red Wales scarf while Kate sported a black and white checked coat over trousers, and held an England scarf with her bag. George appeared to be maintaining a diplomatic stance, with his red and blue puffa jacket free from any England or Wales symbols. Before kick-off, the Cambridges met representatives of the RFU’s community and grass roots game, volunteers and RFU council members including Joe Bedford and Commander Kirsty Marlor, who represents the Navy on the RFU Council.  “It’s a big game,” William said, keeping a protective arm on George’s shoulders as he encouraged the young prince to “shake hands”. William said: “We’re excited. It’s just so good to be back, it’s been quite weird watching games, and football, without the fans.” Asked whether George would be supporting his mother or father’s team today, the young prince shrugged his shoulders and smiled at William, who laughed: “It’s become quite the thing in the house,” pointing at his we, adding: “She is quite into it, I’m trying to stay out of it.” Kate then asked George to tell the group about how he has started playing rugby at his school, Thomas’s Battersea: “He has all the kit,” she said. George spoke about how he has just started learning how to tackle, before turning to his mother: “But I haven’t tackled you yet!” Kate replied, laughing: “Yes you have!”  Earlier this month, at her first engagement as the RFU patron, Kate was presented with mini England kits and referee whistles for her children and told the group that Louis was particularly thrilled with the gts: “Louis loves the kit and he took the whistle into his PE lesson.” Speaking after meeting the Cambridges, Commander Marlor said of George: “I get the impression he’s yet to choose a team. I asked him which position he plays but I don’t think he’s got one yet. “It is such an honour to have them all here today supporting the teams and a fantastic surprise to see George. The duchess was talking about how interested she is in the community game, which is so great to hear. Kate is an avid rugby fan and grew up watching England games with her family, long before her  marriage to William, who is patron of the Welsh Rugby Union. She has continued enjoying international games and in , attended the rugby World Cup hosted by England. Two years later, she was visibly gripped by the tense France vs Wales Six Nations match, during an official visit to Paris, where Wales were narrowly beaten.It came as the Cambridges issued a rare personal joint message of support to the President and people of Ukraine on Twitter : “In October  we had the privilege to meet President Zelenskyy and the First Lady to learn of their hope and optimism for Ukraine’s future. Today we stand with the President and all of Ukraine’s people as they bravely fight for that future.

Princess Charlotte was christened at Sandringhamaposs own parish church of St Mary Magdalene on July , , aged only four months. The church plays a key role for the Royal Family, it is best known as the place where the Queen and other royals attend Christmas mass during their annual stay in Norfolk. But as well as holding a special signicance for Her Majesty, St Mary Magdalene also has a strong symbolic link to the late Diana, Princess of Wales, royal experts told the Express. Do you agree with the royal experts  Have your say in the comment section The commentators suggested St Mary Magdalene was selected in order for Prince William to pay a very personal tribute to his late mother Diana, Princess of Wales. Royal commentator Emily Andrews told Channel aposs Secret of the Royal Palaces: The chapel of St Mary Magdalene is the parish church of Sandringham House. It has a history as well through Williamaposs mother, Diana Spencer. She was also christened there.Princess Diana was born on the Sandringham Estate in July , at a time when her parents, the then-Viscount and Viscountess Althorp, leased property from the Royal Family. Commentator Richard Kay revealed: Prince William likes the symbolism. Heaposs made it clear he wanted Diana involved on the journey that he embarked on with Kate, first as his we by presenting her with his motheraposs engagement ring.And then at Charlotteaposs christening because they chose the very church Diana was christened in herself. Indeed, the couple paid its biggest tribute to Diana with Princess Charlotteaposs full name - Charlotte Elizabeth Diana. They however reportedly opted out of picking either the Queenaposs name or Williamaposs motheraposs name as their daughteraposs first name due to security concerns.  Mr Kay added: I think he very wisely decided not to give Charlotte his motheraposs name as her first name. Everything she did and said would have been compared with her. By giving Diana as the middle name, it means Diana is still there.Princess Charlotte shares one of her middle names with younger cousin Lilibet Diana, daughter to Prince Harry and Meghan Markle.Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm.

But the Met Office have lted its snow and ice warnings and it appears most will enjoy a sunny start to the weekend, giving a short period of relief before the more turbulent weather s.Brits have been warned it could be getting seriously chilly for some in the days ahead. People have been advised to take care when driving in dficult conditions as forecasters say the that chopping and changing weather could last long into next week. Most will enjoy pretty quiet weather for most of Saturday, compared to the chaos brought by Storm Dudley, Eunice, and Franklin that ruthlessly battered the UK last weekend.  But before long, gales will hit some in the north of England with Scotland set to see some really cold temperatures. Meteorologists have said the constantly changing weather is due to a strong jet stream driving weather systems across the Atlantic. Met Office chief meteorologist Andy Page said: “As Storm Franklin clears the UK and pushes into the near continent this afternoon the windy conditions will gradually ease and showers become fewer, leaving some dry, sunny weather for many. “However, a band of rain and strong winds will reach the northwest and this weather front moves south and east through Tuesday, petering out as it does so. “Thursday is potentially the coldest day of the week with a frost to start for some. Gusty winds and heavy rain continue to move south and east across the country, clearing the Southeast of England by lunchtime. “Wintry showers are expected mainly over the hills in the north again, but there could be some snow to low levels at times.” Meteorologist Alex Deakin said the weather will “remain pretty lively over the next certainly four or five days, chopping and changing day-on-day”.  Saturday is expected to be breezy, while people in the northwest have been told to brace for further strong winds and heavy rain on Sunday. Following the Met Office issuing a yellow weather warning for snow and ice, Netweather forecaster Nick Finnis believes the “cold and showery” airstream will bring with it “signicant accumulations” of snow, strong wind, hail and thunder. He said: “A cold and showery polar airstream has moved in from the west across many areas overnight behind a cold front clearing SE England at breakfast time. “Frequent snow showers are piling in across Scotland, N. Ireland and northern England…settling even at lower levels.” BBC forecaster Susan Powell said that there will be a lot of sunshine across the country on Sunday - but warned things will change early next week.UK weather forecast for next five days Today: Northern Ireland and Scotland rather cloudy with patchy rain or drizzle some sunshine in lee shelter. Elsewhere largely sunny after a chilly start with some frost. Windy in west and north, gales across the northwest Scotland. Tonight: Scotland and Northern Ireland rather cloudy with some rain or drizzle. Elsewhere mostly dry and clear. Windy in the west and north with gales across the NW of Scotland. Sunday: Northern Ireland, western and northern Scotland starting rather cloudy with patchy rain, brightening up by afternoon. Elsewhere some cloud in the west, perhaps a little rain later, otherwise sunny. Breezy. Outlook for Monday to Wednesday: Widely unsettled on Monday early gales in the far northwest, and brief period of wintry showers here later. More settled thereafter, although increasing chance of rain in south and west.

Abbie Plummer, from Maidstone, Kent, breaks out with painful and irritating hives whenever her skin comes into contact with water.The rare condition leaves the -year-old forced to avoid the liquid at all costs – including being ultra-diligent on rainy days, and limiting showers to no more than  minutes. She can only go out in the rain with a rain coat or umbrella, as she risks experiencing painful symptoms when the rainwater hits her skin. In the event of a storm, she avoids going out altogether.Abbie is even allergic to her own tears, which can cause her eyes to itch and puff up.  Doctors initially thought she was allergic to her shampoo or conditioner but after switching to skin sensitive cosmetics, she was later referred to a dermatologist in . Nine months later, Abbie was sent for tests at her local hospital where a doctor diagnosed the student with Aquagenic Urticaria — a rare disease which sees a person break out in hives after contact with water, regardless of its temperature. Iaposm perfectly fine drinking water as it does nothing to me internally, she told Jam Press.Itaposs just on my skin. If it is heavily raining I do see my skin start to flare up. When I bath and shower, I just have to try and be quick when doing so. I can usually tell when thereaposs going to be a breakout of hives as my skin gets itchy and red. The longer my skin is in contact with water, the more it develops hives. It is a bit annoying having the condition but thereaposs not much I can do. I have learned to live with it now.  Abbie is even allergic to her own sweat but says it is not as severe as other interactions with water. Although breakouts usually only last  minutes, the pain is stressful for the young woman, who then has to hold back the tears to not cause herself more discomfort. Thankfully however, she is still able to process water normally inside her body. Abbie also takes prescribed medication to make her le a little easier when it comes to dealing with water. Tanning and working out regularly can also help her manage symptoms. She added: With sweat itaposs a bit more manageable as I donapost break out in hives. I usually get a tan and the UV rays from the sun help my skin to not come up in hives. Itaposs not so bad when I go to the gym but I do notice my skin starts to itch. Without taking medication it means my reactions can be a lot severe and painful.

Heartbroken Megan took the decision to have her put down as vets said that she was in so much pain and keeping her alive would be cruelMegan told the Liverpool Echo : From Saturday, she was still eating but she was vomiting up little bits of water. We then noticed that she was having diarrhoea as well, so we thought that there might be a bug or she had eaten something bad, but then she just went downhill so fast. She got to the point where she wasn’t moving, she wasn’t getting up to walk. She just wasn’t feeling herself. We took her to the vets and they gave her an anti-sickness injection but they said her temperature was looking fine. However, things took a turn for the worse and Roxieaposs condition continued to worsen. Megan added: On Monday she went to the vet and then she was drooling, the sickness had stopped but the diarrhoea was really bad. By Monday night, she was at the stage where she was basically dying in front of us.She was starting to bleed from her bottom and she was breathing quite heavily. Megan took Roxie to the PDSA vet in Huyton, Merseyside, on Monday night, but she was so weak that had to be carried to the car and taken into the building on a trolley. On Tuesday, she received the call from the vet saying that Roxie was in too much pain to be kept alive. Megan said: It feels like the dog has been taken away far too quickly. We haven’t had long enough with her. It felt so hopeless, it’s awful. It was a shock. She was the most bouncy puppy in the world. To go from that to not being able to lt her own weight off the floor. It is unsure exactly how Roxie contracted the deadly virus, but having lost her dog, Megan has advised pet owners to be careful with their pets and to take them to the vet as soon as any vomiting symptoms start. Megan believes that she might have picked up parvovirus from parks in the area. The Blue Cross states that parvovirus spreads through body fluids, including in a dog’s poo and vomit. It can survive outside the body – for example in the grass at a park – for at least six months. As a result, Megan has urged dog owners to pick up their poo as soon as possible. A spokesperson from Liverpool Vets, said that they had not noticed a spike in cases of parvovirus, but said that they have seen a vomiting and diarrhoea bug spread in the area each winter. According to the vets, the best way to save puppies is to vaccinate them. If a second dose is given before  weeks of age then a third should be given when the dog is aged between five and six months.

But is splashing the cash on a pricey meal actually worth it  Birmingham Live reporter Kirsty Bosley headed down to Adamaposs, a Michelin star restaurant in Birmingham, to find out.In total, Kirsty spent £ on the experience and for her money, she was treated to a tasting menu that included everything on the restaurantaposs menu. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. The restaurant Kirsty noted she was blown away by the service she received as soon as she walked through the doors - with staff on hand to take her coat, and see her to her table. The reporter was also impressed by the decision to remove the extra chair from her table-for-one, as she said it eliminated the feeling of being lonely that an empty chair can sometimes bring when dining by yourself. Whataposs more, Adamaposs remembered Kirstyaposs request to be shown the vegetarian menu when she booked her table and stuck to it throughout the evening so the reporter didnapost have to think about her dietary requirements.  According to Kirsty, Adamaposs offers three courses for £, five for £, or the whole menu for £ - which is called the tasting menu. The reporter chose to try a little bit of everything and ordered herself a £ peach Bellini on top to wash it all down. The food Kirsty was treated to seven dishes in total, including four starters, the main course and two puddings - although the reporter admitted it was hard to keep track of which dishes she was getting. Although the dishes she received were small, Kirsty noted that the flavour of every morsel was better than she had expected, and left her wanting more every time.  First, the woman received a pretty red beetroot meringue with some kind of little rice cracker thing on top, as well as two pieces of cucumber that the lady who brought it tipped green gazpacho over. Kirsty said she loved both dishes and had initially assumed they were part of her starters until she was informed they were actually just other little dishes to try which the restaurant did not charge more for. When the reporteraposs starters did arrive, they came with a stack of four knives, four forks and four spoons - leaving Kirsty to believe she was going to be truly out of her depth. But the woman was instead overcome with emotion when she tried her first starter consisting of cucumber, lime, and wasabi, as she said: My eyes watered, my mouth watered. It was a ridiculous explosion of flavours that sent my senses into overdrive. I could have kissed the chefsuch a thing wouldnapost get me barred for le.  Kirsty even told the waitress she had enjoyed her starter so much she wanted to lick the plate, and thought her taste experience couldnapost get any better - until the second starter arrived. The reporter was treated to white asparagus with edible flowers followed by leek parcels and Jerusalem artichoke, and she explained that by the end of the third starter a tear had actually escaped and made its way happily down my nose. Kirstyaposs main course, wild mushrooms, was described as thrilling and the two desserts were to die for. The woman said she even got little extra treats when she was paying her bill, including a little bottle of salted caramel and miso syrup for her afternoon coffee and a aposgooey salted caramel chocolateapos to take away. Final thoughts In total, Kirsty spent £. on her Michelin star food journey - and while the price tag was definitely more than your standard trip to Nandos, she said she would save up to do it again in a heartbeat. Summing up her experience, she wrote: While Iaposd got a few photos of my dishes, and one of me enjoying one, I was aware that nothing could possibly capture that experience. The way that all of my senses had been aroused, it just felt like alchemy. Suddenly, they were not tiny little plates of food for big prices. They were experiences, knowledge and expertise, presented in such a way that I could have flownI wasnapost anchored to the restaurant floor by a crisp table topped with stacks of cutlery. Kirsty, who describes herself as common as muck, said the £ price tag was easily worth it for the experience she had and insisted sheaposd be going back to chase that feeling again.Do you have a story to sell  Get in touch with us at yourmirror@trinitymirror .Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON FoodRestaurants\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Serve the food you really want to eat by signing up for our tips and recipes and never be bored by your cooking againSign UpInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

I’ve had messages saying, “I met him in Amsterdam… but we only went on a couple of dates – he never asked me for money.“ I think, “Oh, great for you!” The truth is, he met so many people and picked the ones he knew would help him out when he was pretending to be in need. People often ask me, “How has he got away with it  What are the police doing ” And I have to say, “Your guess is as good as mine!” I haven’t heard back from the police officer who was supposed to be chasing my case. I’ve no idea what’s going on.  I’m desperate to see Simon behind bars. I want him in jail so he can’t do this to anyone . He deserves to serve time for what he’s done to so many people across Europe. One thing that’s bothered me in recent weeks has been seeing celebrities like French Montana and Cardi B tweeting that they met him. That’s their reaction to watching the documentary and seeing women in pain! They have all that power and a big following and instead of sending a message about the pain he’s caused, they just want to show that they met him, like he’s an actor in a popular show. Some people think the same when they meet me. They smile and want a picture like this is a performance – not a traumatic experience. When I hear some of the voice notes Simon sent me on the documentary or on a podcast, they still make me cry. It’s like the trauma is right there in my face again. The outpouring of love from all over the world has been tremendous, but I still feel scared that I won’t get peace and be able to put it behind me.  Simon inflicted shame and made death threats. He told me to “watch out” and that “every action causes a reaction”. He said I had “no idea” what he was capable of and that I’d regret not supporting him.Someone has been private messaging me on Twitter saying I deserve everything that’s happened to me. They said they’ve sent Simon messages asking to be his apprentice because they’re happy he swindled a gold-digger. It’s disgusting, but I don’t let it break me. These people just want attention.I also see people online twisting what happened. One girl commented, “Who just gives out a loan of , ” But I never did that – none of us did. They don’t know the full story. But others are supportive, saying, “Keep fighting!” In Norway, I’m talking to politicians about fraud because the system, when it comes to money, is so rigged towards protecting the banks. I’ve started an organisation, but haven’t got it off the ground yet because I’m trying to fix my own le first. aposSimon is a stupid man with an empty soulaposPernilla Sjöholm says…I never started this because I wanted people to feel sorry for me. I want to highlight what’s happened to so many and ask, “Why hasn’t this criminal been charged ” I’ve seen people posting memes about us girls and Simon, like, “All my enemies are after me – send me money!”, and I get mixed emotions. I can laugh about some parts of the story because you have to. I won’t let him steal our humour after stealing so much, but it can also feel trashy. We faced a big backlash in  when we first told our story, so we knew what could happen with the documentary. We were like, hit us with a busyou want, we’re not going to stop fighting because we might be able to help someone.  But of course it’s scary to share. I still can’t watch some parts of the documentary – I haven’t seen it in full. I hide behind my hands because some parts are just too much. As for relationships, I can meet people… but I have a lot of trust issues. If someone does something nice, I become suspicious and think there’s an evil agenda. I’m glad we’ve started a movement and I hope in the future the police and banks will be more understanding of how this can emotionally impact a victim, not just financially. So many suicides are connected to instances of fraud. I’d love to start doing lectures about these types of matters. I really want to fight to make a positive change in the world. And I want to see Simon in jail. He’s not a real person, so I’d have nothing to say to him. EvenI did, it wouldn’t affect him because he has no empathy whatsoever. He’s not capable of that emotion. He doesn’t have any friends or family. He’s just an empty soul. It’s interesting that after swindling all this money from women, he spent it on bulls**t. Within two to three weeks of this hitting the news he was homeless. I thought, “How stupid can you be  Why didn’t you put % in the bank for a rainy day ” He might be a sophisticated criminal, but he’s a very stupid man.

The team of astronomers has been analysing a series of bright flashes, known as fast radio bursts, which were first spotted in January . These flashes are unpredictable and extremely short, lasting thousandths of a second, but each one sends out as much energy as the sun gives out in a day.In a new report, the team revealed these fast radio bursts were traced to the galaxy M, which is around  million light years away, and that is the closest source ever detected.The astronomers also discovered that these bursts are incredibly similar to ones seen in the Crab Nebular, which is a remnant of a supernova explosion that was seen from Earth in  AD and recorded by cultures around the world.  They have concluded that fast radio bursts can be created by Magnetars - extremely dense remnants of stars that have exploded. Jason Hessels, from the University of Amsterdam, said magnetars are the universe’s most powerful known magnets which are “definitely not surrounded by old stars”. He added: “If what we’re looking at here really is a magnetar, then it can’t have been formed from a young star exploding. There has to be another way”. The astronomers believe the magnetar which caused the flashes in M may have been caused by a white dwarfwhich became massive enough to collapse under its own weight.Franz Kirsten, who led the team of astronomers, said: “Strange things happen in the multi-billion-year le of a tight cluster of stars. Here we think we’re seeing a star with an unusual story.” He added: “We wanted to look for clues to the bursts’ origins. “Using many radio telescopes together, we knew we could pinpoint the source’s location in the sky with extreme precision. That gives the opportunity to see what the local neighbourhood of a fast radio burst looks like. “These fast radio bursts seem to be giving us new and unexpected insight into how stars live and die. If that’s true, they could, like supernovae, have things to tell us about stars and their lives across the whole universe.”Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Space\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The researchers said it likely belongs to a carnivorous group of dinosaurs called abelisaurs, which walked on two legs and possessed only stub-like arms, even shorter than those of North Americaaposs Tyrannosaurus rex. The short arms may have forced Guemesia to rely on its powerful skull and jaws, the researchers said.  Itaposs so unique and so dferent from other carnivorous dinosaurs, which allows us to understand that weaposre dealing with a totally new species, said Federico Agnolin, lead author of a study on the dinosaur published in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology and a researcher with Argentine national science council CONICET. The animal, that could have been young when it died, lived just a few million years before an asteroid impact at what is now Mexicoaposs Yucatan peninsula that wiped out about three-quarters of Earthaposs species including the dinosaurs about  millions years ago.Scientists believe abelisaurs roamed what is now Africa, South America and India, and several dozen specimens havepreviously been dug up in Argentina - nearly all of them in southern Patagonia, far from the site of Guemesiaaposs discovery.We know it had a very sharp sense of smell and was short-sighted, said Agnolin, noting that it would have walkedupright on its large feet, with its solid cranium leading the way.Some scientists think that could mean the animal hunted its prey by charging them with its head, Agnolin added. The discovery adds to Argentinaaposs reputation as a treasure trove of fossils of dinosaurs and other prehistoric creatures.Guemesia takes its name from Argentine independence hero Martin Miguel de Guemes and Javier Ochoa, a museum worker whomade the discovery.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Dinosaurs\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Zakharova said during a news briefing: Finland and Sweden should not base their security on damaging the security of other countries and their accession to NATO can have detrimental consequences and face some military and political consequences.Follow the latest updates on the Ukraine and Russia situation in our live blog  Later, the foreign ministry reiterated the threat online. We regard the Finnish governmentaposs commitment to a military non-alignment policy as an important factor in ensuring security and stability in northern Europe, the department wrote on twitter.Finlandaposs accession to NATO would have serious military and political repercussions.Putin is understood to have attacked Ukraine after western nations examined the idea of the country joining NATO. CNN this morning report that US intelligence officials fear capital Kyiv could fall as early as Saturday afternoon.Russian troops were seen entering the city in the early hours. They have already captured the city of Melitopol in the southeastern Zaporizhzhya region, a combination of trained troops and civilians baring arms have managed to stave off attacks in most other areas. The harrowing night of fighting has taken a great toll on both sides, with estimates suggesting between , and , Russian soldiers have been killed.  A total of  Ukrainians, including three children, have been killed amid the Russian invasion according to the countryaposs Health Minister Viktor Lyashko.A further , people have been wounded, among them  children he wrote on Facebook.It comes as Putin stands accused of bombing a nursery as more heartbreaking footage emerged last night. The horrying drone slips appeared to show a kindergarten, named the Sunshine nursery, surrounded by bodies in the eastern Ukrainian city of Okhtyrka. The unprovoked invasion of neighbouring Ukraine by Russian forces on the command of President Vladimir Putin has sparked bloodshed and chaos. With Putinaposs troops shelling cities across Ukraine and the nationaposs army vowing to fight to the death to defend their land, observers fear the death toll will be enormous.So far, it has been confirmed by President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky that  civilians and military personnel were killed in the country on the first day of the Russian invasion. In an address to his people, Mr Zelensky revealed a further  had been wounded in the fighting. The death toll is set to rise as, on the night of February , Ukraine’s deputy defence minister Hanna Maliar claimed nearly , Russian servicemen had died during the first two days of the deep invasion She wrote in a Facebook post that the troops of the invading country have suffered the following lossesas of pm Friday, before going on to list up to  tanks  armoured combat vehicles of ious types  aircraft seven helicopters and , special staff she claims were among the losses suffered by Russia. Meanwhile, the official Twitter page of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine claimed in a tweet that today the number of losses from the occupying forces of the Russian Federation is more than  thousand. These claims have not yet been independently veried. Ukraineaposs Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said Russain shelling of a hospital was beyond evil.He accused Russia of war crimes after earlier reports of attacks on orphanages.He promised Ukraine would send evidence of the attacks to The Hague. Today’s Russian attacks on a kindergarten and an orphanage are war crimes and violations of the Rome Statute, Dmytro Kuleba tweeted, referring to the agreement that established the International Criminal Court.

Minutes later, missiles begin to rain down on Ukrainian cities - including Kyiv. I wake up to find the war I’ve been expecting for weeks has begun. I’ve been staying in an apartment in the heart of the capital since February  because I didnapost believe any of the claims that Russia was seeking dialogue. I thought the danger for Ukrainian people was very real and I wanted to document what was happening to them. At first, the mood is defiant. I leave my apartment and I see a man waving a Ukrainian flag. People are still on the streets. Some even manage to laugh. But as the day wears on, the reality of what we are facing dawns. Queues for cash machines snake down the streets. I join one, but I’m only allowed to withdraw £. Gradually, the mood becomes more sombre. The roads out of the city are gridlocked as thousands of people head west, in the hope of seeking refuge in Poland. Others pack their bags and head to metro stations, hoping they’ll be safe there.  Friday The atmosphere has darkened overnight. Early in the morning, air raid sirens ring out across the city.I hear the government is handing out rles to citizens in a desperate bid to stave off the Russian advance. On the streets, I run into some civilians who have taken them up. What strikes me is that these are people from completely dferent walks of le, from all age groups and class backgrounds. They are defiant. They want to defend their families, and their homeland.  Outside every apartment block, I see people loading their cars with everything they own and weeping - unsure when they’ll be able tohome. Then, I head to a metro station. Incredibly, some of the trains are still running on a limited service but every station is rammed full of people. I feel asI have stepped into a scene from the Second World War. Itaposs like nothing I’ve ever seen before. Some people have brought their pets. I see dogs, cats and even a hamster. Across the city, shops and pharmacies are closing. I have to walk two miles to buy a pizza for dinner. Saturday The night is disturbed by the constant sound of air raid sirens and the rumbles of gunfire. I hear an apartment block in the city has been damaged by a missile of some sort - it’s not clear which side it has come from - so I find a driver and head there.  ATMs are starting to run out of cash now, and you can only withdraw moneyyou have a foreign bank account. When I get to the apartment block, I’m relieved - but stunned - to find no one has been killed. One side of the building has been destroyed, and there is rubble everywhere. As I head home, I can’t help but think how far reaching the implications of this conflict will be - and Europe has yet to feel its impact.

Like Hitler, he promised peace while all the while being intent on war.Like Hitler, Putin cares nothing forindependence and liberty as he attempts to recreate an empire.And like Hitler, he plans to subjugate a sovereign nation with all the force and brutality at his disposal. Just as we faced down Hitler, we must face up to another dictator determined to destroy the freedoms we hold so dear. And we must do it without sleepwalking into a Third World War.  Boris Johnson compared this invasion with that of Czechoslovakia in . This time there must be no appeasement. That occupation set off a chain of events that took six years of horrying war and  million deaths to resolve. Ukraine must regain its rightful independence sooner than that but, nevertheless, we must be prepared to be in this for the long haul. Now that Putin has chosen the path of war, he has to win it, and we dread to imagine the horrors that might unleash.  That means we must throw open our doors to Ukrainian refugees who appeal to us for a safe haven and might even want to stay here. We are told such a resettlement programme is being prepared. But, as always in Whitehall, the wheels are moving despairingly slowly. Ireland has waived the need for visas for Ukrainians. The Irish will get them to safety first and worry about the paperwork later. We should follow that example. Now it is incumbent on the rest of the world to isolate Russia as the pariah state it is. Even Putin’s traditional ally, China, has shown a certain ambivalence to the tyrant’s actions.  It abstained on the UN resolution to condemn Putin for the invasion – a promising result rather than a great one. President Xi of China is the one man who might persuade Putin to withdraw and he should make every effort do so. Meanwhile, the rest of the world must put a stranghold of sanctions around the Russian state. And NATO must stand firm and resolute.  The borders of Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland are the NATO red line. Putin must be left under no illusion about the lethal consequences of crossing it. Andthe Russian people are as truly opposed to this war as they appear to be, there is only one course of action open to them: to topple the man who caused it.

But by the time I was on the case, the disease was spreading closer to home # in forests near Loch Carron, Ross and Cromarty.Phytophthora, ominously meaning #plant destroyer#, is a genus of fungus-like organisms containing around  known species with a worldwide distribution.The genus, which includes the pathogens that cause potato blight and sudden oak death, has been responsible for massive crop failures, economic loss and environmental damage.Phytophthora are called #fungus-like# since they behave like fungi but dfer from them, and from all animals and plants, in several key features of their reproduction and chemical makeup.This places them in an ill-defined group of misfits called protists, which also includes amoebae, kelp and slime moulds.Phytophthora pluvialis was discovered in Oregon USA in , where it resides in soil and watercourses, and mainly infects Douglas fir.Its recognition in Cornwall during  was the first identication of this particular Phytophthora species in Europe.Thought to have arrived here on imported live plants, its spores germinate in water and can be spread, for instance, on shoes, tyres and animal paws.The pathogen infects a iety of trees, including western hemlock, Douglas fir and several pine species, causing needle shedding, shoot dieback and lesions on the branches, trunks and roots of infected trees.Forestry and Land Scotland and its policy section Scottish Forestry took rapid action # surveillance to detect infected forests, restrictions on the movement of timber and trees, and asking the public to report suspicious tree lesions.But since the European climate is ideal for P pluvialis to thrive, and its favoured trees are commonly grown here, like so many other plant pathogens, it seems likely that this one is here to stay for the long term.Forestry and Land Scotland asks foresters and the public to be vigilant for signs of Phytophthora pluvialis.Anyone who thinks they might have spotted signs of the disease should report it using the online TreeAlert system on the on www.forestresearch.gov.uk website."},{"url":null,"title":"kilberry loop sportive announced","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowThe popular Kilberry Loop Sportive will take place on Saturday August  this year.Organised by Mid Argyll Triathlon and Cycle Club and local man John Hardie, the -mile open road event starts and finishes in Tarbert.Registered as an event with British Cycling, the fun, friendly Kilberry Loop Sportive is targeted at every level of cyclist.

This is particularly good advice for anyone with a veg plot.A sowing plan of what seeds and how many to sow each month is key to successful growing and means you won#t be throwing out unwanted seedlings and that your flower and veg beds will be full all year round.A word of warning about sowing direct into the ground at this time of year there may be a few sunny days to enjoy outside but the soil can still be chilly, making germination and survival hard.Sowing indoors is a better option. Not only does it provide a warm environment for germination, but seeds and seedlings are easier to protect from pests. If you can find some environmentally sound sowing trays and containers, rather than using plastic, that#s even better. Paper and cardboard pots can be packed snugly in a tray which avoids over handling and makes them easy to water.Small seeds should be scattered sparingly on the surface of compost filled seed trays then covered with a sprinkling of sieved compost. If the seeds are big enough to handle, you can sow them inidually into cm pots. The quantity should be according to the instructions specied on the seed packet, but usually for small seeds between five and  seeds per pot. For plants that grow long roots, such as peas or beans, you can put them into a compost filled cardboard toilet roll tube and, once ready, they can be planted outside, tube and all.Most seeds will germinate and grow in a warm setting such as a greenhouse, cold frame or on a sunny windowsill. You should keep them damp by using a mist spray to start with before moving onto a watering can with a fine rose nozzle.Once the seedlings have grown their second pair of leaves and before they get too squashed in seed trays or pots, pot them on into small pots. Simply ease out a clump of seedlings with an old cutlery fork or dibber and # handling only the leaves to avoid damaging delicate stems and roots # gently tease them apart. Drop inidual seedlings into a five-centimetre compost filled newspaper pot ensuring the lower leaves are above the compost level. Once you see roots appearing from the bottom of the pot, it’s time to pot on to a bigger pot before planting outside once the weather and soil warms up.If you are growing your own veg, now is a good time to sow first early potatoes. These can be planted from mid-March, however planting times will y across the country according to temperature and risk of frost. Early potatoes grow well in the ground and in containers such as potato grow bags or old compost bags. You should plant your chitted potatoes with the shoots facing upwards in soil with plenty of well-rotted organic matter, approximately cms deep and cms apart.Once stems are about cms tall, they will need earthing up by drawing soil around them to create a cm high ridge, to protect against frost and keep growing potatoes covered. Good ieties of early potatoes are: Swt # good for containers, white skinned and white fleshed Annabelle # nutty flavour with firm waxy yellow flesh and Maris Bard # white flesh with good #new potato# flavour and drought resistance.Spring seems tantalisingly close in March, particularly as work in the garden starts to get going again.According to the Royal Horticultural Society, spring usually arrives by mid-March and the frequent sunny days provide the opportunity for an increasing range of gardening tasks.

testing to continue in ScotlandNicola Sturgeon expressed frustration over Boris Johnsons approach to Covid testing that he outlined on Monday.The Scottish Government is \"determined to retain\" free Covid testing, in contrast to England.Nicola Sturgeon criticised the decision by Boris Johnson to end universally free testing and said that the Scottish Government was looking for clarity on funding for the testing programme for devolved countries.Ms Sturgeon said: “Current funding arrangements mean that though taxpayers in all four UK nations contribute to the costs, it is decisions taken for England that determine the resources available to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland for testing and other Covid measures.“As of now, we have no clarity on how much of the Covid testing infrastructure the UK government intends to retain no clarity on how much investment will support it in future and no clarity on whether the Treasury will provide additional resources to pay for it or demand instead that funding is taken from where in the healthbudget.“I hope we get this clarity soon so that we can out in more detail our longer-term approach to testing.“However, and I will say more later, I want to give an assurance that the Scottish Government is determined to retain a robust testing system capable of providing Scotland with strong resilience against future Covid threats, and firmly aligned with public health advice and the principles underpinning our National Health Service.”.remove: Nicola Sturgeon update LIVE as Covid roadmap published: Covid Scotland: Vaccine passports scrapped and changes to face mask rulesNew Covid Strategic FrameworkThis weeks announcement coincides with the publication of the Scottish Governments Covid strategic framework.Nicola Sturgeon said the Scottish Government’s strategy was now to “manage Covid effectively, primarily through adaptations and health measures that strengthen our resilience and recovery”.In her statement to MSPs, the First Minister said: “Widespread vaccination coverage and better treatments have reduced the direct harms of the virus.“As a result, using restrictions to suppress infection is no longer as necessary as it once was.“And, given the wider harms caused by protective measures, it is no longer as justiable either.“The strategic framework therefore makes clear that in future we will rely less on legally imposed measures to control the virus – and more on vaccines, treatments, and sensible adaptations and good public health behaviours.”The framework sets out three broad levels on how the Government may respond to potential iants that could see restrictions reimposed, Nicola Sturgeon had said.Setting out the contingency strategy for low, medium and high risks, the First Minister told MSPs: “If a new iant emerged that was more transmissible and more severe, perhaps with the ability to evade vaccine or natural immunity, this would likely be classied as high risk.\"In those circumstances, we might advise people to limit social contacts for a period and to work from home where possible and we may introduce some temporary protections for high-risk settings.“If a new iant was either more transmissible or more severe, but not both, as is the case with Omicron, the initial threat assessment would likely be medium.\"In these circumstances, there may be a legal requirement to wear face coverings in some settings and we might issue guidance for businesses and service providers on reasonable measures to reduce the spread of Covid on their premises.“Lastly, in the absence of a new

the speaker at the most recent meeting was Colin Middleton from Campbeltown#s Co-op supermarket.He gave a most interesting and informative talk on the workings and history of the store and gave us all goodie bags which were greatly appreciated.We would like to thank him very much for taking time out of his busy schedule for us.Regarding plans to demolish flats in a sensitive area of the town, as reported in last week#s front page article #Have a say on planned Dalintober demolition#, these are iconic buildings in terms of the aesthetic value they bring to the town#s outstanding seafront location.I fully understand the need to reduce housing stock, in line with a declining population, but previously demolished buildings in adjacent areas – Saddell Street and Queen Street – are now unsightly gap-sites.Local opinion is important, given what has happened in the wake of recent housing demolition. There is concern, often heard in local conversation and frequently discussed on Facebook, of what might happen in the latest round of town planning.To be fair, plans are afoot to replace the same with modern housing – probably less stock to suit the demands that exist in the town at the moment – however, it is really important any proposed build be sensitive in design to suit this prime parkland location, an area fronting onto Kinloch Park and town#s seafront Esplanade.I share this concern, given the results of previous demolition, but also hope any future plans will include thoughts to increase housing stock, this in line with greater employment opportunities and rising population levels.I am appealing to people throughout the region to support my Right to Food Bill proposal before the consultation closes on Wednesday February .In the wake of Ofgem#s eyewatering increase in the energy price cap last week, which will see already struggling households having to wrestle between paying for heating or paying for food, the Right to Food has never been more needed.If the SNP and the Greens hadn#t played party politics and kicked my Bill back, we could have already been working on ensuring the Right to Food is enshrined in Scots law.Instead, we are having to re-consult at a time when the country is already grappling with a cost of living crisis.On Thursday, Ofgem announced that from April the energy price cap would rise  per cent to £, – that is an extra £ households will have to find just to keep their homes warm and the lights on.Forthcoming increases to the interest rate and rises in National Insurance payments will exacerbate the situation.It is heart-breaking. I have had food bank helpers in tears saying we can#t wait another year for the Right to Food to kick in. People need help now.Food bank volunteers need assurance that the invaluable support they provide in their communities will end one day, when wages and benefits are adequate enough for proud families to be able to stop using the food banks.New statistics show rising homelessness across Scotland. Food bank use is soaring. Illnesses of the past like rickets and malnutrition have reappeared.In a rich nation like Scotland, in the st century, this is appalling. It#s Dickensian.People are struggling right now – it#s time the First Minister stops commentating on the cost of living crisis and starts doing something about it.She could start by allowing her MSPs to support my proposal."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week february 11 2022","story":"I was excited to see Seville oranges in the grocers.

Avoid plantingthe ground is frozen or extremely waterlogged.Your planting hole should be no deeper than the roots, but at least three times the diameter of the root ball.It#s a good idea to soak bare-rooted trees for about  minutes before planting.Place the tree in the planting hole so the first flare of roots on the stem are level with the soil surface. If you plant the tree too deep, it can result in rot and disease.You may need to insert a stake for top heavy or larger trees. Refill the planting hole, firm gently and water in.Drought stress is common in newly-planted trees so make sure you keep watering throughout the growing season. The quantity required will y with soil type, but  to  litres per square metre – four to six watering cans – each week in dry weather will do the trick.If you are growing your own vegetables, now is a good time to sow lettuce seeds – both under cover and outside.If you start now, it will give you a continuous supply that can be harvested throughout the year.Sow in modules or fibre pots under cover to have lettuces ready to plant outside in four to six weeks. You can also sow outdoors, but use cloches or small poly tunnels until next month when the soil has warmed up. They will also provide your lettuce seedlings with protection from birds and slugs.Good ieties to start now include cut-and-come again Salad Bowl – oak leaved, high yield with green and red ieties a cos such as Lobjoits Green – dense, crisp heads with self folding leaves or the small butterhead Tom Thumb – perfect for growing in small spaces, it matures early and has a mild taste.Prepare for spring by carrying out basic maintenance.As the Royal Horticultural Society says, this month there are signs of the approaching spring, with bulbs appearing and wildle waking up as light levels and temperatures increase.There#s plenty to do indoors this month to prepare for the season ahead.Outdoors, as the garden comes to le, it#s time to prune shrubs and climbers, such as wisteria, as well as evergreen hedges."},{"url":null,"title":"driver woes derail oban golfer bobs title bid","story":"The honorary Machrihanish Golf Club member finished tied in ninth place at the Ras al Khaimah Classic on the final leg of the DP World Tour#s Desert Swing, building on his solid performance over the same course the previous week.After carding an almost flawless opening round of  on Thursday, Robert suffered a cruel piece of bad luck before his Friday round after the face of his driver cracked during his warm up on the practise range.Speaking after carding a  on Saturday, following his  on Friday, Robert said he struggled with his replacement driver.#Unfortunately, my driver cracked on Friday morning and I#ve not got the perfect replacement but no-one does,# said the left-hander.#Off the tee, I#m trying to find my golf ball.

The mine was finally rediscovered by HMS Bicester early last week.Bad weather made it impossible for the crew of the Bicester to attach a surface riser to it and the mine was left to a Navy ing team to bring it up.Led by Lt Adrian Dann, the four-man Northern Diving Team from Faslane finally pinpointed the mine on Tuesday morning and brought it up later that day.The two-tonne mine is currently lying on the New Quay waiting to be picked up by the mine laying team from Cromby, Fe.FIFTY YEARS AGOCampbeltown churchgoers, in common with other congregations throughout the country, are being asked to sign petition forms calling for an end to public filth in television and literature.Already many people, including non-churchgoers, have appended their names to the forms which are also in several businesses in the town.The forms are headed: ‘Petition for public decency.’It states: ‘Being concerned about the effect on society – particularly on the young – and of the increasing exploitation of sex, the public portrayal of intimate or unnatural sexual behaviour and violence and brutality, we the undersigned call upon Her Majesty’s government: to note the concern of the public about this matter. to ensure that the law as regards of sanity stops this public affront and is so designed as to be an effective instrument for the maintenance of public decency.Some church congregations in the town have already begun signing the petition and others planned to follow suit in the near future.All of Campbeltown’s ministers are in agreement that the obscenities on television and in literature are going too far, and hope that the petition has the desired effect.The Reverend James W Hood, of Lorne Street Church, commented yesterday: ‘I think it is perfectly right that the church should be given the opportunity of speaking its mind.’SEVENTY YEARS AGOThe majesty and pomp of King George VI#s funeral procession through London, and later its journey to Windsor Castle, was seen and heard by people in Campbeltown and Tarbert on Friday, in the history-making experimental television broadcast.In both places, reception was remarkably clear and those who were privileged to see it saw this royal journey of dignied and poignant pageantry in a much greater detail than the vast crowds in London and Windsor.At both places, the sets, with -inch screens, were shown by radio dealers to parties of friends.Mr Anthony P MacGrory, Campbeltown town councillor and housing convener, had his set installed in the radio showroom of his firm’s shop in Main Street.At Tarbert, the set there was arranged by Mr Douglas C Smith, Electrical and Radio Engineer, Harbour Street.Earlier last month, Mr Smith informed us that he was getting surprisingly good results from the test from the Scottish television station at Kirk o’ Shotts – the Scottish station which is using only low power transmission.Scottish TV reception of this historical occasion was the previous day viewed with serious misgivings and doubts by BBC experts, who pointed out that the Kirk o’ Shotts station was not due to open until March  and that this is the first-ever television radio link up, connecting Scotland to London, through Manchester, was merely an experiment and the Scottish transmitters were still undergoing adjustment.So, until the TV programme went onto the air on Saturday, the BBC could give no guarantee that the venture would be successful.It was a great success and thousands of Scots over a wide area, from Dumfries to Aberdeen, saw clear pictures of the funeral processions.At Campbeltown and Tarbert, the pictures were almost as clear as everyone was looking at them on the cinema screen, the detail in some of the pictures being unbelievably perfect.One local businessman, who saw it, described it as ‘uncanny’.But, throughout the years, this has been the descriptive of all great inventions when they first made their impact on the public mind.It was a pity, of course, that this great moment in Scottish television progress should have been heralded in with such a sad event as the funeral of our King.Considering that Kintyre was not regarded as a good reception area and that this  miles relay was the longest ever attempted by the BBC, the result was truly amazing and will no doubt mean the booking of many orders from this part of the country.Already, Mr McGrory has been receiving enquiries from ious parts of Argyll.We were privileged to see the screening in Mr MacGrory’s premises that afternoon. The scenes from Paddington to Windsor were impressive, especially the arrival at Windsor and the unforgettable journey to St George’s Chapel.To those people in Kintyre, so far from the television network, it must have been an unforgettable experience to have this outstanding London ceremonial brought hundreds of miles to before their eyes and to be taken in imagination straight to Windsor to watch the Royal coffin being carried out and upon it the Imperial State Crown, the orb and the sceptre and the white wreath of orchids, camellias and lilies of the valley from Her Majesty, the Queen Mother, also movingly clear."},{"url":null,"title":"leader february 25 2022","story":"This week#s publication of the report on the follow-up visit to Campbeltown Grammar School makes welcome

down these days.I suggested to my husband, John, that we should buy each other a tree for Christmas and plant them in the garden of our new home.In fact, I ordered six – three each – dwarf fruit trees, due to high winds in Drumlemble, and we planted them in January.The apples are two x Golden Spur, two x Redspur and, pears are two x Lilliput Dwarf.With fruit trees, there is also the benefit of fresh fruit in years to come, either for us or future residents in our home.In response to Alex McKinven’s letter in the February  edition of the Courier titled ‘Any Dalintober developments must be sensitive’, hopefully I can give an assurance on behalf of Argyll Community Housing Association .Despite the merits or otherwise of a debate on aesthetic value with respect to the Dalintober buildings, they do not meet the needs of ACHA’s current or future tenants for a iety of reasons around layout and energy efficiency.ACHA is committed,demolition is permitted, to build  high-quality family homes, built sensitively in this outstanding seafront location.In reference to the gap sites at Saddell Street and Queen Street, ACHA does plan to bring these sites back in to community use and will consult on that in the very near future.That will be consistent with what we did when we demolished properties in central Campbeltown and replaced them with  family homes at New Parliament Place, Park Square, Longrow and McCallum Street.ACHA is committed as a partner of Argyll and Bute Council to do all we can to complete the direction of travel of regeneration in central Campbeltown over the last  years and we believe that our proposal for Dalintober and our consultation for Saddell Street and Queen Street will take that forward.My we and I have recently received from the pension service a note of our increase in the state pension from April  .The increase is . per cent whilst, by that time, inflation is expected to be in excess of . per cent.Therefore, this published increase is actually a decrease in real terms of . per cent.This is, of course, due to the triple lock guarantee being abolished by Rishi Sunak.I was pleased, however, to be informed that upon reaching my th birthday in December this year,I am still here, I can look forward to a further increase in my state pension of  pence per week.Any suggestions as to what I should spend this welcome amount on Never mind, when the SNP and Greens obtain independence, they will be able to increase my pension from their abundant resources.Then again, all the SNP’s money trees have been blown down in the recent gales.Perhaps I should rely upon the Scottish Government being in a position to capture one of the flying pigs overhead to fund my state pension when independence is achieved.Yeah, that’s

the original singing kettles packed with favourite songs including: Music Man, Buy me a Banana, Bunny Fou Fou, Eelly Alley O, as well as stories and even some magic tricks.Speaking to the Banner Artie Trezise said it would be the first time he had performed on Arran since staging a school show on the island more than  years ago.He also has fond memories as a child coming to Arran from Cupar in Fe and it was here that he learned to ride a bike.He said: #The show is nostalgia for adults and fun for kids. Bring granny too. We promise not to #Shove Granny off the Bus#.#The Singing Kettle was formed in the early s by Artie and his we Cilla Fisher. Very soon they were joined by Gary Coupland and the three stalwarts were the backbone of the company for more than  years.From the very start Singing Kettle shows have been based on clues for songs inside brightly coloured kettles with the famous chant: #Spout, handle, lid of metal. What#s inside the singing kettle # # which Artie still uses today.While this principle was always central to the action, plot lines and stage sets were built around imaginative story lines, transforming the original concept into a spectacular musical for the whole family.The Singing Kettle turned children’s theatre into an art form and the troupe#s unique performances became the bench mark for fellow professionals everywhere.They performed in hundreds of venues, from the Palladium in London to the Town Hall in Campbeltown, from the Palace Theatre in Kilmarnock to the Royal Palace in Jordan.BAFTA-award winning and decorated with MBEs for services to children’s entertainment, audiences worldwide were hooked on their madcap musical adventures flavoured with cheeky Scottish humour.Adults and children alike found themselves singing the songs together long after the performances were over.The company closed in , with the final line-up forming Fun Box and with Cilla retiring.Artie continued performing solo shows as Artie#s Tartan Tales but since the beginning of  his show is now Artie#s Singing Kettle.There is a £ one price ticket for the show, plus booking fee.

more opportunities to spend quality time with guests.Mr Bevan added: “We are delighted here at Leuchie House that this award, thanks to the National Lottery players, will enable people enjoying a respite break at Leuchie to access these technologies with the help of our occupational therapist and digital skills co-ordinator.”Kate Still, Scotland chair of The National Lottery Community Fund, said: “National Lottery funding can make amazing things happen in local communities across the country.“This project delivered by Leuchie House is a great example of community activity in action, showing just what can be achieved when people come together for a common cause or to help others.“National Lottery players can be proud to know that the money they raise is helping to support this vital work and to help communities thrive.”"},{"url":null,"title":"tims-tales-celebrating-10-years-tims-tales","story":"Outside, in the darkness, the wind is howling once again, keeping me company.It has been  years this week since I began this column and, apart from a couple of months after the birth of our son seven years ago, I have written something every week.The content has changed over the years indeed, it has changed from week to week.I write about stories in its broadest sense sometimes a historical theme, sometimes folklore, often about the wonders of nature and our beautul landscape. But over these last years, I have also written stories inspired by my observations and experience of le and people. It’s been a mixed bag in terms of theme and topic.Recently, at a talk to a local group, one of the members came up to me and said: “I’ve read your column for years now, with my tea and biscuits on Thursday mornings. I’m never sure what to expect, but that’s what’s kept me intrigued, it’s a bit like a lucky dip.”The most interesting stories for me are those of people I meet, and this column has given me the privilege of getting to know folk I would probably never have met otherwise. Some have become good friends, but I’d like to take this opportunity to say thank you to all those who have been in contact, shared their stories and time, shown me places or given me comments. I’ve said it before and will say it again: the ability to write every week and connect with people is a huge privilege I am very thankful for.Telling a story on Traprain Law I feel very lucky as I’m now able to give talks and have the joys of storytelling in schools and where. We have all yearned for ato ‘normality’ but of course so much has changed and what’s normal for one person isn’t for another. I know that many people can’t, or feel unable to, enjoy the relaxation of measures. I’m acutely aware of the dference in people’s experiences and circumstances our stories are dferent and the impact of the last two years will be felt for many years to come.It’s light now, the sky outside is grey and the bare branches of the nearby trees are dancing in the wind. The birds are searching for the seeds I left out for them in our small garden, and it’s almost time to wake the children to get them ready for school. In moments like this, I try to pause and soak in the magic of le. It’s not always easy to do so like most folk, I have my bag of worries, anxieties and problems, and sometimes the day ahead, with all its responsibilities, can shadow my mood.But watching the morning arrive, even on a cold, blustery February day, is a gt. Our days are our lives, and we need to pause and think about how we spend each one of them. I have learnt the importance of this as I’ve got older of letting my soul catch up with me, putting things into perspective by opening that bag of worries and seeing them for what they often are: less important than they have made me believe.Storytelling at Cuthill a few years ago So with your patience, and I hope your company, at least every now and then, I plan to continue to write this column, perhaps not for another  years, but at least for a while yet as circumstances allow. I still have new places to explore in East Lothian, a list of people to meet who have kindly agreed to share their stories, and our county is blessed with a rich heritage of history to discover.And as I always say when I do a storytelling session, I am not the only storyteller in the room, for we are all storytellers. This is The Year of Stories, a time to celebrate the stories which have made us who we are, as an inidual, as a community, as a nation.But I think it must also be a time to celebrate and indulge in the art of traditional storytelling itself, that powerful personal connection made with a telling of a tale between teller and listener heart to heart, eye to eye, mind to mind. In this age of TikTok, which is redefining attention as a -second soundbite, then the need to scroll on, I think the ancient craft of the traditional storyteller, is needed more than ever.I hear folks say: “He’s a storyteller, so he would say that!” But of course, “I’m not the only storyteller in the room” you are a storyteller too. We all have stories and tales worth sharing. And the more we share, the more we may understand each other.So I look forward to hearing and perhaps sharing more tales in the weeks, and possibly years, ahead. Perhaps your story, your tales too "},{"url":null,"title":"sports-direct-reveals-uks-loved-sports-teams-including-arsenal-chelsea","story":"The sports retailer analysed teams associated with leagues across eight sports from up and down the country and crafted a list based on a number of critical factors.The researchers looked at everything from the teams brand sentiment on social media to its number of online searches.The ranking was also constructed by looking at online mentions, social following and fan engagement.Sports Direct store.

address Boris Johnsons Living with Covid policy and the scrapping of all Coronavirus restrictions in England as of Thursday.This week, Nicola Sturgeon announced her Covid strategic framework also known as a roadmap out of Coronavirus restrictions.Heres what Ms Sturgeon said during her Covid briefing today.Today First Minister @NicolaSturgeon will give an update to @ScotParl on #coronavirus.Watch live ➡️ https:t.co zWDxpMyAe from :pm. pic LKTccbDImNicola Sturgeon expressed frustration over Boris Johnsons approach to Covid testing that he outlined on Monday.The Scottish Government is \"determined to retain\" free Covid testing, in contrast to England.Nicola Sturgeon criticised the decision by Boris Johnson to end universally free testing and said that the Scottish Government was looking for clarity on funding for the testing programme for devolved countries.Ms Sturgeon said: “Current funding arrangements mean that though taxpayers in all four UK nations contribute to the costs, it is decisions taken for England that determine the resources available to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland for testing and other Covid measures.“As of now, we have no clarity on how much of the Covid testing infrastructure the UK government intends to retain no clarity on how much investment will support it in future and no clarity on whether the Treasury will provide additional resources to pay for it or demand instead that funding is taken from where in the health budget.“I hope we get this clarity soon so that we can out in more detail our longer-term approach to testing.“However, and I will say more later, I want to give an assurance that the Scottish Government is determined to retain a robust testing system capable of providing Scotland with strong resilience against future Covid threats, and firmly aligned with public health advice and the principles underpinning our National Health Service.”                                                                                                              : Nicola Sturgeon update LIVE as Covid roadmap published: Covid Scotland: Vaccine passports scrapped and changes to face mask rules                                                                                                              This weeks announcement coincides with the publication of the Scottish Governments Covid strategic framework.Nicola Sturgeon said the Scottish Government’s strategy was now to “manage Covid effectively, primarily through adaptations and health measures that strengthen our resilience and recovery”.In her statement to MSPs, the First Minister said: “Widespread vaccination coverage and better treatments have reduced the direct harms of the virus.“As a result, using restrictions to suppress infection is no longer as necessary as it once was.“And, given the wider harms caused by protective measures, it is no longer as justiable either.“The strategic framework therefore makes clear that in future we will rely less on legally imposed measures to control the virus – and more on vaccines, treatments, and sensible adaptations and good public health behaviours.”The framework sets out three broad levels on how the Government may respond to potential iants that could see restrictions reimposed, Nicola Sturgeon had said.Setting out the contingency strategy for low, medium and high risks, the First Minister told MSPs: “If a new iant emerged that was more transmissible and more severe, perhaps with the ability to evade vaccine or natural immunity, this would likely be classied as high risk.\"In those circumstances, we might advise people to limit social contacts for a period and to work from home where possible and we may introduce some temporary protections for high-risk settings.“If a new iant was either more transmissible or more severe, but not both, as is the case with Omicron, the initial threat assessment would likely be medium.\"In these circumstances, there may be a legal requirement to wear face coverings in some settings and we might issue guidance for businesses and service providers on reasonable measures to reduce the spread of Covid on their premises.“Lastly, in the absence of a new iant, ora new iant was neither more transmissible nor more severe, andvaccines continue to be effective, the threat classication would likely

And it’s not only access to curling rinks affecting the sport, ice rink operators are fearful of how the energy price hike might affect them. Some are likely to be affected by soaring energy bills as they maintain ice conditions in their venues.And off the back of the boom in curling interest, the charity formed to lead the campaign for theof a Glasgow ice rink is ready to take their fight forward.It comes at a time when Perth and Kinross Council this week made a financial commitment to delivering Perth’s new pool and ice rink.The £ million facility – which will replace Perth Leisure Pool and Dewars Centre – is scheduled to open in  . Team GB womens team members Eve Muirhead and Mili Smith trained at the Perth rink in the past.With little time to get over jet lag following hisfrom Beijing Team GB’s men’s curling coach Alan Hannah knows only too well how important this welcome spotlight on the sport is.As well as leading the men’s team to silver, he is also the chairman of the Glasgow Ice Centre which formed as a campaign when they became aware that the facilities at Braehead were set to close.“We set up the charity with the purpose of trying to find a new home for curling in Glasgow, we set up a feasibility study and over a period of time we have been in discussions with the city council and Glasgow Le which runs sport under culture and leisure, but not really anything has happened there. We appreciate they are pretty much in turmoil themselves off the back of Covid,” said Mr Hannah.“Our feasibility study quite clearly demonstrated that we needed to be multi-use, have skatingas well as curling and probably some kind of ice hockey. Off the back of the medals we are now intending to pick this up again and bang the drum.”Scottish Curling has seen a rise in demand for places on its introductory programme Try Curling and while Glasgow is suffering from a lack of facilities, a facility on the east coast, Curl Edinburgh has been inundated with inquiries with people interested in taking to the ice.Mr Hannah said: \"Facilities is one of the major issues and challenges we have not just in Scotland in England as well. They have got a bigger challengethey are trying to open up to a new audience. Venues are a hot topic and for us we are looking at a -minute drive distance, a .million catchment area of Glasgow and we don’t have our own ice facility. The council is acutely aware of that and for some time they have prided themselves on being a destination with sporting venues built off the back of the Commonwealth Games and the one glaring gap they have in their sporting portfolio is that they don’t have an ice facility.”While Mr Hannah operates at elite level, the campaign recognises how important the community element is.He added: \"I am acutely aware that the way to present these things is very much about it being central to a community and that it is a community based facility that has leverage benefits about health and wellbeing access to sport and participation.“We would be looking to offer of public skating and ice hockey and there would be a dedicated to curling. The skating part is hugely important to give opportunities to access something that has a health and wellbeing aspect. From the curling aspect we promote it as a sport that is accessible to anyone from eight years old to -year-old.”Mr Hannah, who has been coaching Bruce Mouat’s men’s team for five years, said they had high hopes heading to Beijing and while there was slight disappointment they didn’t get gold in the final against Sweden he believes the team can go on to the next winter games.“I’m sure in the days and weeks ahead all of us will be immensely proud of coming home with the silver medal. We came home to Edinburgh with huge support with lots of messages from people sending best wishes,” added Mr Hannah. “If they want to go again they could be in another Olympic final they are of that high a quality.”Read more: Architect behind Burrell Collection redesign says it has opened up the heart of the buildingMaggie Wilson, head of development for Scottish Curling, said the Olympics is the pinnacle of publicity for the sport for them adding: “we see it as a two-week advert on prime-time TV and we were ready to capitalise on that.“We saw spikes on our TryCurling website every time we’ve been given a mention by the commentators in Beijing.“We have some great teams coming through our curling academy programme and I’m not too worried about our future medals success as I think we have got the programme there to allow for that. What we need mass participation, getting people through the doors. The last thing we want is for this to become a niche sport that is only aimed at medals. This is a sport that can be played in every local area and with a growth in that and the number of schools and juniors playing we are going to see when you have the numbers the medals take care of themselves.”It was the Forfar rink which Beijing gold medal winner Hailey Duff was first introduced to curling at the age of eight-years-old.Scottish Ice Rink Association Mike Ferguson, who runs Forfar Indoor Sports and remembers her first time on the ice, says it’s at grassroots level in communities where there can be greater impact, but there is a major challenge facing ice rink operators.“Ice rinks have been inundated with requests on the back of the Olympics with a lot of people wanting to try beginners sessions,” said Mr Ferguson, who is also the vice-chairman of the Royal Caledonian Curling Club.“It’s a welcome positive but for ice rink operators we could do with support to help one of the biggest issues we face and that is rising energy costs. Many operators will be due to renegotiate their deals and some will be facing in excess of £, with increases of  or  per cent. It is a massive black cloud hanging over the industry.“That’s why we want to see people coming into their local facilities. Curling is a sport which Scotland excels at but it’s curling at grassroots level, the way Hailey Duff, came through in her local community, that can make a dference.”A Glasgow City Council spokesman said: “Together with Glasgow Le, Glasgow City Council has had constructive conversations with Glasgow Ice Centre and will continue to discuss their aspirations to develop a multi-sport ice facility in the city.”"},{"url":null,"title":"curling-scotland-list-ice-rinks-can-curl","story":"The Scottish Ice Rink Association says curling rinks up and down the country have been inundated with inquiries and booking requests since the medal triumph in Beijing.Eve Muirhead and her team of Vicky Wright, Jen Dodds, Hailey Duff and alternate Mili Smith took the women’s gold medal for Team GB at the Winter Olympics with Bruce Mouat’s men’s team, Grant Hardie, Bobby Lammie, Hammy McMillan Jr and alternate Ross Whyte, bringing home the silver.Read more: Glasgow ice rink campaign takes off after Olympic medal curlers triumphHere is a list of Scotland’s curling rinks.

On the shore, a gently sloping sandy shelf means the clear water is shallow enough for children to paddle.Close to the village of Baile Mò and the ferry pier, the beach’s calm beauty, however, has a dark, disturbing past: its name translates as Martyr’s Bay, after the killing of  monks in ad by marauding Vikings.These days it is tourists who seek it out one of hundreds of Scottish beaches that,not for the bitter wind and constant threat of rain, could have fallen from the pages of a Caribbean holiday brochure.At the start of her mission to track down Scotland’s most beautul beaches for a new travel guide, outdoors writer Stacey McGowan Holloway noted Martyr’s Bay on her list of those which merited inclusion.But, on Iona alone, an island only . miles wide and  miles long, she found a further three: along with Martyr’s Bay was Camas Cuil an t-Saimhwith its crashing waves and beautully coloured pebbles, Port Ban, secluded and sheltered with steep clfs embracing white shell sand, and North End Beach with dramatic, rocky shores, pristine sand and occasional seals.By the time she had finished her list of Scottish beaches worthy of being included, it had stretched to well over .Some were remote and rarely visited. Others, like Portobello near Edinburgh, were a stone’s throw from large towns and cities. Many boasted stunning rocks and sweeping bays, the promise of spectacular sunsets and mesmerising views of neighbouring islands.Others had gripping historic stories to tell, or offered a unique chance to be close to wildle.Eventually, her list was whittled down to just over  ‘best’ beaches, stretching from the Northern Isles to Dumfries and Galloway, down the east coast and right across the Hebrides.Some were well known ‘Instagram’ beaches – it would be hard not to include Traigh Shiar on Vattersay, with its wide stretch of machair and wooden gate that opens on to dazzling white sand and blue water.Others are even further off the beaten track. Visiting them would involve her spending weekends travelling hundreds of miles by bicycle and car, noting down their features and detailing just what makes them so special.The  plus beaches have now been included in The Beaches of Scotland, which details how to find the nation’s most beautul beaches, their potential for a dip, paddleboarding, kitesurfing, kayaking and other sports, and how easy – or tricky – they are to get to.However, some of Scotland’s most precious beaches have been left out, deemed too good to include for fear of opening them up to too many visitors.“The hardest thing has been choosing which beaches to include and which to leave out,” says Stacey, who splits her time between working as a cancer research scientist and, outdoor writing. She is also a member of Oban Mountain Rescue Team and founder of the Tyndrum  ultra-running race.“There are so many wonderful beaches, and some were too good to put include.“What can make a place special is that it’s hard to find and too hard to get to.“I do drop hints that there might be a beach nearby that could be worth visiting, but I prefer to leave it to the readers to work out where.”Instead, the book focuses on beaches which are reasonably easy to reach – evensome, such as Kearvaig Bay in Sutherland, require a strenuous km hike - that can sustain tourists and which offer something more than a stretch of sand and some chilly water.Such as Blackwaterfoot, on the island of Arran, where the long beach of sand and rocks gives way to a coastal walk passing impressive Drumadoon Point, a breeding area for fulmar, jackaw and kestrel, and where ers and black guillemot can be seen.The walk leads to King’s Cave, where Robert the Bruce is said to have hidden in the winter of  and took inspiration from a spider, while ancient carvings and Pictish symbols on the walls suggest he was not the cave’s first inhabitant.On the Ardnamurchan peninsular in Lochaber, Camas nan Geall – bay of strangers – has mesmerising views over Loch Sunart, the remains of a Neolithic chambered cairn at its head and the ghosts of crofters cleared from the land following the Jacobite uprising in .While remote Scoor Beachon the southern coast of Mull has large, white sandy beaches with crashing waves, awe-inspiring views and caves to explore.Scoor Cave is hard to find, explains Stacey in her book. But the reward comes in dramatic views and cave walls covered in rock carvings said to date back to – BC. A few kilometres away are the ruins of the town of Shiaba, emptied during the Highland Clearances.Some of the beaches featured may be very familiar: Dornoch beach with its sweeping sands and nearby caravan parks bustling with holiday makers, Aberdeen beach near the city centre with its Category B-listed, art-deco Beach Ballroom and Brodick and Lamlash on the Isle of Arran, wide, east-facing and when the sun shines in summer, packed with visitors.According to Stacey, however, the best Scottish beaches don’t need a blistering sun, which is probably just as well.“One of my personal favourites was Blanakeil Bay, right on the north coast, in Sutherland,” she says. “I arrived in April, it was freezing and the sun was very low.“I was by myself, it was sunset and I’d be travelling three days in the car and camping at night.“There was no-one around, and it was like standing at the end of the earth.”While the beaches she visited offered beauty and closeness to nature, waste and pollution was also often not far away – even at beaches like Oldshoremorenear Kinlochbervie in Sutherland.Miles from anywhere, its white sand of eroded stones and crushed seashells is offset by aquamarine water and, unfortunately a share of marine waste.“Sandwood Bay is another,” she adds. “I would try to pick up and take away as much litter as I could.“But it’s a km hike to get to it. A lot of fishing rubbish gets washed up andyou’re picking it up, you then have to carry it back with you, which isn’t always easy.“I found the amount of fishing litter really quite shocking.”That aside, she points out is dficult to dampen the magic of a day at the beach.“Scottish beaches have so much history, there are croft ruins or iron age ruins. It’s not just this expanse of water, because in the ground under your feet or behind you is all this history.“When you’re on the beach, you get this perspective that reminds you how small you are,” she adds.“There’s something about being by the water that is really ‘freeing’, all the background noise seems to disappear.”"},{"url":null,"title":"delivered-margarine-tub-scots-beans-revolutionise-dinners","story":"Henry Taylor was retired and in the early stages of dementia. But that had not dulled his determination to cultivate a new iety of bean, one that would be ideal to grow in a Scottish climate, with a host of environmental benefits and the bonus of being protein-packed and tasty.Having experimented and cultivated his crop for  years, he took his margarine tub of beans to the doors of Scotland’s crop research institute to see what they thought.The result, it has transpired, has become something of a bean revolution.For far from humble beans, Henry’s iety have been revealed as a Scottish ‘super’ bean, harbouring a range of special qualities which could revolutionise crop growing and bring a range of environmental benefits – from curbing the use of fertilisers on farmers’ fields, to cutting carbon emissions.Not just that, they are small and with just the right qualities when cooked to make them perfectly palatable, potentially helping to meet soaring demand for climate-friendly vegan food and an ideal Scottish homegrown alternative to one of the nation’s staples, baked beans.Plans are now underway for the first cans of Henry’s Scottish Beans to be cooked, canned and sold as the nation’s first homegrown baked beans.Although UK consumers get through more than two million cans of baked beans every day, a lack of suitable bean ieties adapted to the UK climate, means not a single bean they eat is grown here.Instead, the baked beans that land on the nation’s plates are imported, mostly from Canada.Cultivating the right bean would not only open the floodgates to a host of bean-related food products, but it would also help cut food miles, curb emissions and help farmers introduce a nitrogen-fixing legume in their crop rotations, benefitting the soil and curbing fertiliser use.Such a bean feast was not quite what Dr Pete Iannetta, a plant biologist and ecologist based at The James Hutton Institute in Dundee expected when he received a call asking him to meet a gentleman in reception who was carrying a margarine tub filled with beans.“He said he wanted to talk to the ‘bean man’,” he recalls. “Henry said he had developed this bean that ripened in the same timeframe as a pea, which was unusual for a faba bean.“I thought that was a nice thought, however some people have been trying to do that for quite a while.“So I told him, ‘leave them with me’.”Aware that Henry had once worked as a Field Trials Officer for a forerunner of the institute, Pete took the tub and planted the beans. Nature took its course and soon – far sooner than might be expected from a typical crop of faba or broad beans - Henry’s beanstalk sprouted.And Pete soon realised that the beans, gted to the James Hutton Institute by Henry in  and which he dubbed simply ‘Scottish Beans’, are,not exactly magic beans, certainly far from the average.“Henry wanted the bean to be an early ripening beans, because normally it’s very dficult to get a faba bean out of the ground in time in Scotland,” he explains. “They are relatively big plants that grow quite tall, but they generally don’t ripen until early September.“That means some farmers can’t harvest them. They aren’t wasted, they still provide a good manure, but they are a challenge,” he adds.Henry’s dwarf faba beans are smaller and have been cultivated to be early ripening, meaning one crop can be harvested allowing growers to use the nitrogen-rich residue in the soil left behind to quickly sow a second crop.While large-scale commercial corps of common haricot beans used for canned baked beans need around kg of nitrogen per hectare, Henry’s Scottish Bean doesn’t need any.Pete also found it grew well alongside barley, enabling the cereal to thrive without the need for synthetic nitrogen fertiliser.And because the beans perform well when they are ‘direct drilled’, the soil does not need to be ploughed, which helps to avoid the emissions of greenhouse gases that creates.The beans’ potential as a food crop could solve a range of other problems at a time when demand is growing from vegetarians and vegans for alternatives to heavily processed, low-nutrient fake meat style products.Currently most faba beans grown in Scotland for human consumption end up being exported to North Africa, with some imported back in the form of falafel and other foods. Other crops are used for animal feed.However, Henry’s Scottish Beans are particularly easy to cook with a thin and palatable skin – raising hopes they can reignite the use of homegrown beans which were once a staple ingredient in the nation’s kitchens.Highly nutritious with high levels of protein, slow energy release starches, high fibre and essential minerals, the beans can be ground to make flour for bread, added to soups, casseroles and stews, and even turned into a hot drink.“Whatever you do with wheat, you can do with beans,” explains Pete.“You can even roast the flour until it’s toasted, mix it with hot milk and sugar and it tastes like liquied digestive biscuits. It is % protein and with high essential minerals - have it for breakfast and it will keep you going all day.“I have come across some great books from the s with recipes which use peas and beans. They were often used for brewing and distilling because the crops were grown together with barley – it was known then that they worked naturally together and complimented each other.”The Scottish Bean is already gaining interest from bean growers globally as well as in the UK, while a quantity of the two and half tonnes of Henry’s beans that have been harvested will go to an organic grower who will work with Glasgow-based social enterprise Locavore to grow the beans for the retail market.The first cans of baked Scottish beans are expected to hit shelves next year. Although likely to be more expensive than typical beans, the potential is said to be huge: every hectare of farmland has potential to produce , tonnes of beans, while just one tonne of beans can produce , cans.The Scottish Bean has also led researchers at The James Hutton Institute to dig into its archives, where it has uncovered three long lost ieties of beans, Glen Lyon, Glen Carse and Glamis. Work is now being carried out to see how they may be cultivated into new Scottish crops.Henry, who retired in the s, was in his nineties when he died last year but had been kept up to date with a range of scientic tests on his beans.Pete adds: “They were dferent times in the Eighties, and when Henry left the Institute he wanted to continue what he started.“He took some beans home with him and was growing them in his back garden, just enjoying what he did.“His we told me the beans were so precious that the family was rarely allowed to eat them.“Henry’s stock of beans is a godsend,” he continues.“His bean is being called ‘the Scottish Bean’ but I wonderit really should be called ‘Legacy’ in recognition of everything Henry did.”"},{"url":null,"title":"wordle-253-todays-wordle-word-27-february-hints-answer","story":"The aim of the game is to find a  letter word in only six attempts.The game uses the same rules as Scrabble, where only real words are allowed both in guesses and the result.If you get a letter in the right spot and form the correct word, the square turns green.Butthe guessed letter is in the word but not in the right spot, the square turns yellow.Letters that are wrong turn grey to help the process of elimination for the six tries.If you’re still trying to save your streak, then don’t scroll down yet, maybe some hints will send you on your way.Today’s word starts with the letter c and ends with the letter T.There is one vowel in today’s Wordle word.And it sounds like ant. If you have given up on today’s game, then we can save you the misery.

This stems from the  Harbours Act which states that any harbour may be open to all for the shipping of goods.“But in my view is this is so very dferent. Can you imagine Churchill complying with Victorian legislation and allowing a vessel owned by a hostile nation into the Flow “We have a proud maritime history in Orkney, and we should play our part and issue an immediate ban on all Russian vessels entering our harbours. This would be a peaceful but very effective act.”Councillor Sankey intends to liaise with OIC officers, his councillor colleagues and politicians early next week to see how this visit can be stopped. He says he can’t condone OIC services of any type assisting the vessel.“Whilst we may by law have to allow access, there’s no law that says our pilot boats and tugs should be used, and I’m deeply unhappy about our harbour assets helping a Russian ship under current circumstances,” adds Councillor Sankey.In a statement provided to The Orcadian on Saturday, Orkney Islands Council said the authority is an “extremely dficult position.”A spokeswoman said: ”We recognise the strength of feeling around this — feelings that we share —  but we are bound by our legal obligations to accept the vessel, until such a time as the UK Government tells us otherwise.“We have sought urgent advice from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, who have told us that the current sanctions do not cover this operation.”We continue dialogue both with elected representatives and Government departments on this situation as we seek to clary what possible further action can be taken.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Craig Harkness, Ross Connolly and Darren Cassells on the wings were making super tackles when required, while Andrew Mullholand kept the opposition outside the circle.Bangor won a short corner, but Ballynahinch kept the ball out and go on the attack. Leslie Harrison found Alex Millar and he passed the ball to Hugo Melville who attacked up the right hand side before being stopped in his tracks.Before the end of the first quarter Bangor ed to the lsquoHinch circle and took the lead with a tap-in at the back post.With both sides now settled in, the second quarter was full of end to end action. Matthew Martin made a break through the Bangor defence and passed the ball to forward Jason Campbell who won a short corner. Bangor were able to stop the Hinch drag flick from the top of the circle.With Bangor on the front foot and looking to increase their lead they applied the pressure on lsquoHinch. They moved the ball around looking for an opening and went further in front with a shot which came off the back board.lsquoHinch kept the heads and created chances, but they couldnrsquot stop Bangor going - in front.In the third quarter Ballynahinch kept trying to get on the score sheet with Ashley Brown, Andrew Mulholland, Leslie Harrison and Alex Millar all working hard.Hinch started to creep up the pitch and Matthew Martin created a channel for the ball to be fired up to Jason Campbell, whose attempted pass to Michael Carney was unfortunately intercepted.Bangor were able to create several chances in the Hinch circle, only to be stopped by keeper Aaron Donnell, Ashley Brown and Andrew Mulholland. However, they added another goal to the scoreline with a well-placed shot.In the final quarter Hinch broke through the Bangor defence and Craig Harkness narrowly missed pulling a goal back.Bangor were on the attack for most of the closing stages and forced a series of short corners which were kept out as lsquoHinch put every player behind the ball.However, a well placed pass across the circle narrowly missing every Hinch stic and was deflected in at the back post.As Bangor continued to attack, a drag flick from the top of the circle was deflected over the crossbar by keeper Donnell and a number of late short corners and further attempts on goal were kept out by stout defending from Ashley Brown, Leslie Harrison, Matthew Martin and Alex Millar.Player of the match: Ashley Brown.The club wishes to thank the Primrose, Ballynahinch, for their continued sponsorship..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Bhoys batter Carryduff in goal feast at Ballyhornan  ","story":"CELTIC Bhoys breezed through the adverse weather conditions to remain in the hunt for the league title as they swept aside a depleted Carryduff outfit at Ballyhornan on Saturday.Hat-tricks apiece for Celtic marksmen Sean McMahon and Jordan McCoubrey helped the Hoops to an emphatic victory on a weekend when plenty of other fixtures suffered postponement as a result of Storm Eunice.The away side only travelled with a total of  players and so immediately were at a disadvantage as the hosts knew they could call upon their benchneeded.With this in mind, Celtic attacked the opposition from the outset with strike partners McCoubrey and McMahon linking up on numerous occasions within the opening minutes.It didnrsquot take long for the home side to find the back of the net after Barry Treacy lofted a pin-point pass on to the head of McMahon, who steered his effort past Carryduff lsquokeeper Conor Leggett.Although often pressed back into their own half, Carryduff were determined to make a go of it and knew they had to make the most of their seldom opportunities.Midfielder Ciaran Conway saw his free-kick glide gracefully into the arms of Celtic custodian Nathan Curran, before McMahon was again causing problems at the other end.This time he saw his headed effort ruled out for offside. This was a warning sign of things to come as just moments later McCoubrey managed to put the ball into the net courtesy of the outside of his right boot after a scramble in the box.Again, Carryduff showed their resilience and still relied on their counterattacks, the latest coming from captain Conway, although his misjudged pass denied team-mate David Quigley a chance at goal.The pressure would continue to mount on the Carryduff back line and soon it was - as McCoubrey registered his second of the match mdash albeit through an unorthodox but neat finish.Celtic defender Blaine Connolly saw his effort fantastically thwarted by Carryduff lsquokeeper Leggett, who pounced to the bottom right corner of his net with a strong outstretched arm to deny further punishment.The weather began to give its input into the game as temperatures ped bitterly and the wind began to blow harshly at intervals.Although this cannot be cited as the determining factor in this contest by any stretch of the imagination, it certainly played its part when Carryduffrsquos Emmet Curran saw his through ball carried beyond its intended target.Carryduff did manufacture a rare breakaway and it looked asstriker Jonathan Wilkinson would open the away sidersquos account when a pass from midfield left him with just lsquokeeper Curran to beat.However, an impressive last-ditch tackle from defender Gary Carberry allowed the Celtic number five to hook the ball to safety, thus further frustrating the opposition.Celticrsquos Shaun Megahey saw his left-footed effort saved before Carryduffrsquos Joseph McBrien swept up the loose ball and in the last notable action of the half, Conway witnessed his lowly struck effort palmed away from danger by the Hoopsrsquo number one.As the second half kicked off, the home side showed no signs of relenting as they pushed for more goals.Conaill Kerr saw his point-blank effort superbly saved from six yards by lsquokeeper Leggett, who, despite the score line, made numerous contributions to prevent his side conceding into double figures.This over-eagerness from the hosts would cost them as they were caught short at the back, leaving Raymond Grant unmarked  yards from goal.The striker quickly picked his spot and unleashed a lovely curled effort into the top right hand corner to get his side off the mark.Unfortunately for Carryduff, this was as good as it got as Celtic replied almost immediately with McMahon grabbing his second of the matchafter rounding the lsquokeeper for an easy tap in.Things went from bad to worse for the away team when Stephen Galbraith slipped a pass into the path of team-mate Conaill Kerr, who made no mistake with his finish in the one-on-one scenario.At this point Carryduff were aiming for damage limitation but Celtic smelt blood. McMahon completed his hat-trick with an eye-catching acrobatic effort before McCoubrey, tapped in his third of the day.Hoops defender Carberry picked up a yellow card after some unsavoury words with the official and captain Michael Rice was left red-faced after midfielder Curran knocked the ball between his legs, but the home outfit didnrsquot let that deter them from their onslaught.Carberry atoned for his booking in the form of a late header from a Galbraith corner delivery to round off the scoring at -.After the match, hat-trick hero Sean McMahon gave his thoughts on his sidersquos resounding victory.ldquoIt was a good performance, he said. ldquoWe knew they only had  players so we had a good chance of winning but you have to play the  minutes and make sure you get the victory at the end of the day.ldquoWersquove put pressure on the league leaders, itrsquos good to score three goals but the main thing is to get the three points.He added: ldquoI donrsquot usually score headers so thatrsquos my pick of the goals for me.Celtic Bhoys: N Curran, S Megahey, B Connolly, R Fitzpatrick, G Carberry, M Rice , B Treacy, C McCartan, S McMahon, J McCoubrey, C Kerr.

The Gill brothers, Gareth and Kyle, were among the replacements.Ballynahinch used the conditions superbly to burst into a lead they would not surrender.Playing with the wind, they pinned the students back with excellent tactical kicking and after missing an early long range penalty they went for the corner following a UCC offence at the breakdown and Kyle McCall burst from the edge of the maul to score.A great kick and chase moments later led to another penalty and another maul try for McCall. Greg Hutleyrsquos superb conversion took Ballynahinch  points clear after  minutes.The second quarter yielded only a single UCC penalty. Ballynahinch were not quite as accurate as they had been earlier in the game and small errors and indiscipline allowed UCC plenty of possession. However, excellent defence and long clearing kicks meant that the Ballynahinch line was never threatened.The second half was a scrappy affair and Ballynahinch began to fall foul of the referee at the breakdown.UCC kicked a long range penalty to close the gap to six points and missed another moments later as Ballynahinch struggled to put phases together into the wind.

Ballynahinch piled on the pressure, carrying hard at the line and desperate UCC defence led to another penalty and a yellow card for their replacement prop.The game was now there for the taking and following another big scrum on the UCC line Ballynahinch tried to put Conor Rankin over on the blind side.Multiple phases later UCC looked to have weathered the storm when they stole the ball and kicked clear. A superb chase saw Ballynahinch caught in possession but Cairns made an excellent arcing run to scythe through the cover and head for the line.He was tackled just short but the supporting Hutley was on hand to barge over, taking a knock in the process.He recovered to slot the conversion, sending Ballynahinch  points clear going intothe last five minutes and they saw out the game in relative comfort.Celebrations lasted long into the night and Ballynahinch have now put daylight between themselves and UCC.Third from bottom UCD arrive at Ballymacarn Park on Saturday to take on a rejuvenated local outfit who now have a snf of avoiding the relegation play-off.

The design was rejected by the council.The campaign started last May when contractors turned up with equipment and portacabins and marked the trees for felling.Local resident Lily Devlin noticed the development and started the campaign, first rallying support via her Facebook page, and then starting an online petition.Speaking on behalf of the Save the Trees Campaign group, Cathie McKimm said: ldquoThe council got this wrong from the beginning.ldquoWe now have a situation where the council are applying for planning permission for a project they have already appointed contractors for and the project has increased by almost % in cost.ldquoIn bringing in experts to late at a huge cost to the ratepayer to fix the many mistakes theyrsquove made, including failing to include a drainage system in a flood risk area, the council are now having to contribute more than pound, to this scheme and growing, whereas before they were only contributing approximately pound, for the same scheme. ldquoGiven all the conflicts of interest that the council now have we do not believe they can assess this planning application objectively, and believe that the Department of Infrastructure needs to call it in and conduct a full investigation about how this has been handled.A council spokesman confirmed that a planning application for the project would follow regulations which apply to all councils throughout Northern Ireland in making its decision.He said: ldquoThe council will let matters follow due process, mindful of the procedures put in place by the Department for such planning applications.He also confirmed that the project, which was planned as a local tourism boost, had increased in costs.ldquoThe council has applied for and obtained funding of pound, towards the project. At the start of the regeneration scheme, the proposed costs were circa pound,, he said.ldquoHowever, with the passage of time, increased construction costs and refinement of the scheme , the costs were last estimated at circa pound, which was agreed by council in October .A DfI spokesperson confirmed it had initially considered making a preservation order on the trees.He added: ldquoHowever, on January  , the council confirmed that it had instead opted to submit a planning application. This was lodged on December  to the Planning Service of the council. The necessity of whether it is expedient to complete the process of making a TPO is on hold pending the outcome of the planning application..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Smell wind of change as lambs leap around fields  ","story":"IT is spring again in Lecale and new le abounds in the fields. Daffodils are peaking out of the ground, the weather is softening, and the feast of St Brigidrsquos Day , February , has passed.This can mean only one thing ndash lambs! In fact, lambs have been born in our practice since before Christmas. But the majority will be coming to a field near you over the next few weeks.Now, modern flocks have a lot of sheep in them. Indeed, there are about five million sheep in Ireland overall. Thatrsquos one for every man, woman and child.Our domestic sheepis descended from a primitive European ancestor, today found mainly in Corsica. In the past it was common for sheep to havejust one lamb. But today, thanks to better feeding, shelter and shepherding, it is possible for sheep to have twins, triplets and even quads!This abundance can come with problems though. Whata sheep doesnrsquot have enough milk to feed this many lambs  Well, farmers have come up with a number of solutions.The first is lsquopet lambsrsquo. These lambs are hand reared. They are fed with a bottle using condensed milk from commercial suppliers. Or the milk can be taken from another ewe who is producing a lot.As anyone with a baby will tell you, this solution is labour intensive and will keep the shepherd working around the clock. But they are dedicated, and they do it! It is not always sustainable in the long run. Another solution is fostering.Lamb fostering is where a ewe adopts the lamb from another ewe. The reasons for fostering can be manold. A lack of milk is one of the major reasons. The ewe may not want to take on another lamb, not recognising it as her own, but shepherds have adapted one of naturersquos many wonders to encourage it to happen.They use a technique called olfactory imprinting. Have you ever wondered how a ewe can recognise her own lamb in a flock of hundreds  One reason is that, just after birth, the ewe learns the smell of her newborn. This is what olfactory imprinting means.Shepherds can take advantage of this amazing process by rubbing some of the birthing fluid of the newborn lamb into the wool of the lamb to be fostered. The ewe will then accept the lamb as one of her own, and feed and care for it. The lives of many lambs are saved in this way.So when you next look at the fields of Lecale, check out the sheep and seeyou can tell them apart. Evenyou canrsquot, their mums can!.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Ulster Aviation Society left ‘dismayed’ over council at Festival of Flight decision  ","story":"THE decision by Newry, Mourne and Down Council to cancel this summerrsquos international Festival of Flight in Newcastle was taken without consulting one of its key partners, it has emerged.Last weekrsquos decision to pull the plug on the event mdash which was last held in  mdash was taken in secret during a meeting of the local authorityrsquos Enterprise, Tourist and Regeneration Committee.It is understood that no contact was made with the Ulster Aviation Society which has played a major role since the inaugural festival and described its disappointment at the cancellation decision.Regularly attracting in the region of , people to the resort in the summer, the flagship tourist event has been a major success for over a decade.Council officials say that due to the challenges in planning such a major festival, securing commitments from participants and with the uncertainty caused to date by the pandemic, organising this yearrsquos event would not be possible.Some councillors believe that given the local authorityrsquos St Patrickrsquos Day parades in Downpatrick and Newry are set to go ahead next month and with the further easing of Covid regulations, some form of airshow could have been organised for Newcastle this summer.This week, Slieve Croob councillor Alan Lewis urging the council to confirm that next yearrsquos festival will go ahead.The Ulster Aviation Society said it was ldquodisappointed and dismayed about the cancellation of the airshow and the fact that the organisation had not been consulted.Society chairman Ray Burrows said it was ldquoastonishing that the event had been ldquoshot down in secret, with no reasonable explanation.Mournes councillor Willie Clarke has urged the local council to ldquograsp the opportunity and organise an alternative event, suggesting a large scale festival that incorporates and builds on the most popular elements of the Festival of Flight.He is keen to see an event showcasing the regionrsquos ldquooutstanding food and drink offering with Newcastle a designated venue for arts, culture and music events to create opportunities showcasing the entrepreneurial spirit and pioneering innovation of the district.Mr Burrows said while these were ldquoall excellent suggestions, he said as elements in addition to, or within, the Festival of Flight, surely not as a replacement for it.He continued: ldquoThat said, we would be pleased indeed to meet with the council or the mayor to discuss the matter. We want to help Newcastle demonstrate in a powerful, popular way how important our aviation future and heritage are to Northern Ireland.ldquoThatrsquos exactly what did in recent years, before Covid.ldquoWe [the UAS] had probably the most popular exhibition within the ground-based event and thousands of parents have brought their children for photographs in our Spitfire and our Alouette helicopter, at no charge.Mr Burrows suggested that unless the councilrsquos decision is reversed, or at least re-assessed, he expects there will be tremendous disappointment from the public.The international festival was cancelled in  because of bad weather and in  and last year because of the Covid- pandemic it was also grounded.Urging the local authority to confirm that it will be chocks away for next summerrsquos Festival of Flight, Cllr Lewis said that for the past two years, the organisation has been unable to deliver a tourism events programme due to the impact of Covid-.ldquoAlthough the possible impact of future Covid iants is dficult to predict, it is hoped that larger scale events can resume this summer. This will be a welcome boost to residents and the local trade and hospitality sectors, he continued.ldquoCouncil research indicates that almost poundm was generated in  for the district as a direct result of tourism events. Therefore, it is bitterly disappointing that this yearrsquos Festival of Flight will not be going ahead.Cllr Lewis said the income that it would have generated would be a welcome boost to traders in the town and benefit the collective tourism industry across South Down.He continued: ldquoWe must not underestimate the huge draw of this annual festival. I note that council officers have said that throughout this past  months they had continued to engage with key stakeholders including the RAF.ldquoIt was advised that due to challenges planning the festival, securing air assets and the uncertainty of the pandemic that it has not been possible to host the festival of flight this year.Cllr Lewis revealed that he has been contacted by many aviation enthusiasts who are bitterly disappointed that the festival wonrsquot go ahead.He added: ldquoI fail to see how the event couldnrsquot have at least been planned for later in the year, now that we know the majority of restrictions are to be lted. I am asking the council to alleviate fears by confirming that the Festival of Flight hasnrsquot be shelved. Every effort must be made to ensure this wonderful attraction be ed to Newcastle which has been its home for  years..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/13508765.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

So I will just say this.I first encountered Christopher in the early s when covering politics and recall seeing him with the  DUP Westminster candidate in Newry and Armagh, when Sinn Fein won the seat off the SDLP. He was part of boisterous, but not unpleasant, scenes between the rival groups of supporters at the count. I later had dealings with him when he was a DUP press officer in a team that was not afraid to push the party’s case. Then I saw him mature into a thoughtful politician, as was so evident in his recent appearance on a BBC Spotlight Special.He was courteous with a dry wit. A year or so ago he arrived at the BBC to find that I too was waiting to go on The View, and said with pretend weariness but slight smile: “Ah, a vaguely conservative voice on commentators’ corner for once.”    \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

It was silly, but to give Jimmy his due there was always a wee message in it, just like the work I do with the Gang today. “Always, each side of the community got an equal send up, again just like what we do with Give My Head Peace. It was all very even.“At that time I was still working in the court house for Antrim County Council because in those days, unless you were wealthy, actors could never afford to give up their day jobs. You were in the performing arts for the love of it.Olivia and her late husband Bill whom she married on June , . The couple went on to have one daughter, Patricia“I would come out of the court house like the clappers and get a bus up Royal Avenue to the Group Theatre. Sometimes we would do double shows for three weeks over Easter and over Christmas, but it was so much fun, you didn’t resent being so busy.“Every six months we changed the show, but when we would do two shows, the same people who were into theatre would be sitting there every single Saturday. People would come to the play at half six, go to John Long’s fish and chip shop for their tea and then sometimes be back in time for the second performance.”Olivia recalls that the love of her le, her late husband Bill, whom she met through the Larne Drama Circle, died of an aneurysm in .“Bill and I were always trying to get married, and I would say, ‘I’ll just do another play, Bill, and then we’ll get married.’ Olivia as a cherubic child. She began elocution lessons at the tender age of three and has been performing in one way or another ever since“We got married on June , , and got a flat, and we put every penny we got into it, and we just thought we were the bees’ knees. “Then in August of ‘ internment came in and absolutely everything stopped, the city went dark and the curtains came down in the theatres. No plays, nothing, and there was Bill and I sitting like two prunes, albeit in love.“There’s not a day goes by when I don’t miss him, but after his death I had to raise my daughter Patricia who was just ten then, and le had to go on. My love of acting sustained me.”She first joined Tim ‘and the boys’ on BBC NI’sPerforated Ulster and then came the call to join the cast of Give My Head Peace for what would go on to become the now iconic satirical series in  and ever since nobody has dared cross, or targe, the inimitable doyenne of the dramedy.‘I’M ACTUALLY VERY SHY OUTSIDE A ROLE’“At age three I was signed up to do elocution lesson,” says Olivia. “I was always used to standing up and speaking.“Basically though, and people may be very surprised by this, but I am actually very shy, and I hate going into rooms with people who I don’t really know, because I always think, ‘well why would they want to talk to me ’ “So I was always nervous, but I never had any qualms about going on stage and I always did a lot of public speaking.“At first, when I started to do it, I used to pretend that I was somebody , for about the first two minutes and that’s what got me through.“With drama you can be very shy, but when you take on a role you become somebody , and there’s a real liberation in that because you no longer feel self-conscious - you are transformed when you play a particular part.”Nash added: “When I left school, I joined Larne Drama Circle at the age of  and it was the making of me as a performer and to this day all of us are like family, my family outside my family - %.”‘IF YOU CAN MAKE PEOPLE LAUGH TOGETHER, THAT’S REALLY OVERCOMING DIVISION’Olivia, who starred in the iconic Billy Plays in the s alongside a very young Sir Kenneth Branagh and the late Jimmy Ellis, whom she remembers as an “absolute gentleman”, received her MBE in  not just for the rich tapestry of her theatre work but also for her uwavering support for the Northern Ireland Hospice for whom she has gone on innumerable fundraising walks and loves to visit to chat and entertain patients. She feels all of us could learn some perspective, namely “how to stop grumbling about things that don’t matter”, from witnessing the incredible work they do there.But today she feels blessed beyond measure, that besides working in radio which allows her to play a “tall, slim blonde” when she feels like it, she is delighted to be part of a show that frequently flags up the absurdity of our sectarian politics and entrenched, ludicrous ision where we could have unity and fraternity.”No disrespect to Stormont, butthe cast of Give My Head Peace had a half an hour up there, I think it would get politicians on both sides of the ide working together much better. “If I had a pound for all the times people stop me in the street and tell me how much Give My Head Peace made them laugh and upllted them, whatever circumstances they were going through, I would be very rich, and I feel very privilegedto have been allowed to be a part of something so wonderful, which I think very much shows that whether you are orange, green or neither, there is so much more that unites rather than ides us in Northern Ireland. “There is barely a day when somebody doesn’t shout out ‘Ma!’ to me in the street.”It’s obvious the gang are thick as thieves and Olivia tells an hilarious story about a programme special they did on the continent when she fell a*** over face into a freezer trying to retrieve some prawns, with a passerby having to pull her out by the ankles, which became comedy gold in one episode, and on a special set in Rome when they had the full humour of Uncle Billy wanting to meet the Pope.How does Ma keep Da in line, I wonder  “Oh that’s my secret,” laughs Olivia. “Da gives her a hard time, but, as in so many households, it all runs off Ma like water off a duck’s back.\u2028“You know I’ve a fabulous family, great friends and an acting career that allows me to do one of the most wonderful things, which is to make people laugh even in the midst of their own personal struggles and to be able to spread joy.“And to me the arts and comedy deserve more respect than they are often afforded, becauseyou can make people laugh together, that’s really overcoming ision.”‘IF I HAD A MAGIC WAND, I’D MAKE EDUCATION IN NORTHERN IRELAND INTEGRATED’Olivia, who calls Dame Judi Dench her ultimate acting inspiration, not only because of the incredible range that has allowed her to do everything from Shakespeare to the Bond franchise but also because she seems “so lovely” in interviews, recalls being repeatedly in trouble at school because she was simply born a very chatty and bubbly livewire.“I was at school in the days of the slap, as it were, and I had lots of them. I hold my hands up, I was always talking too much in class.”After joining Larne Drama Circle at  she was involved in so many dferent productions and drama festivals, appearing in comedies and plays like Brian Friel’s The Loves of Cass McGuire, Tea in a China Cup and even musicals. “Our church had a very strong music society and I cannot sing for peanuts. If I joined a choir, they would pay me to leave, probably. “But one year we did The Music Man I played Mrs Paroo. It was like speak-sing, you spoke it to the beat. We went to Waterford for the festival of light opera and I actually won a prize for best comedienne and to this day I can’t stop laughing about that or marvelling at how it actually came about. “The next year, we did Brigadoon, and I had a part as Meg Brockie, and one of her songs was My Mother’s Wedding Day, and I won a prize that year as well!”If Olivia had a magic wand and could change anything at all about Northern Ireland over night, she would like to see integrated education implemented here.“I remember growing up in Larne, being wheeled about with my friend in a buggy. She was a Protestant, and she was my best friend. Then, because I was a Catholic, she and I had to go to dferent schools when we got older, and I could never understand it.”Olivia added:“We should be together and everybody should be allowed to follow whatever religion they want to follow without it being a question of you being right and the other person being wrong, or anyone trying to impose their beliefs on anybody . “We need to have mutual respect for each other and I think integrated education is the way forward in trying to make that a reality.”See Give My Head Peace  on tour on March -, at the Market Place Theatre, Armagh March , at the Alley Theatre, Strabane March , at The McNeill Theatre, Larne March -, at the Riverside Theatre, Coleraine March , at the Strule Arts Centre, Omagh March -, at the Millennium Forum, Londonderry March , at the Theatre at the Mill, Newtownabbey March , at The Braid, Ballymena March -, at The Ardhowen Theatre, Enniskillen March -, at the Burnavon Theatre, Cookstown and March -April , at the Grand Opera House, Belfast.A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

They say that the beach is a sand and shingle beach and has a reputation for being one of the cleanest in the region. There is a coastal walk, chance to go fishing, surfing and views of Tusker Rock.For those owners who may not yet have ventured to the beach with their pups or are concerned about behaviour while at the beach, Wood Green’s dog behaviour and training specialist, Wendy Kruger, has provided some tips to prepare your dog for the beach.• Ensure your dog’s microchip and collar tag details are up to date – just in case.• Get used to checking ground surface temperatures before you take your dog out, as dry sand can be too hot for dogs’ paws on sunny days. To check the ground temperature, place the back of your hand on the ground. If its too hot to hold comfortably for five seconds, it’s too hot for dogs’ paws..remove• Practise basic, reward-based training when out and about to help your dog to maintain focus and engagement on walks.• Recall is also an area that needs particular attention. Evenyour dog has a great recall at home, its not something that can be guaranteed in unfamiliar environments with exciting new distractions. Games with toys are a fantastic way to help your dog engage with you when there are other distractions around. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Women are more likely to ditch their partner than their pet, found a poll for nationwide pet retailer Jollyes. Asked about their relationship with their partner and their pet and which one they would ditch first,  per cent said they would ditch their partner against  per cent who would ditch their pet. Men were more loyal to their partners, with  per cent saying they would ditch their pet and  per cent saying they would ditch their partner. Overall,  per cent would ditch their partner first and  per cent said the pet would go first. The study was carried out by Jollyes to gauge humans’ attitudes to romance and relationships as it launches the search on social media for a canine couple to take part in a romantic dinner for two at its doggy dates diner, “C’est Jollyes”, open for one day only on  February at its Runcorn store in Cheshire . Two dogs will get the chance to enjoy a three course dinner featuring a menu from Jollyes Artisan Lestage range including angus beef with sweet potato, venison and salmon, and duck with sweet potato. The survey showed some big dferences in attitudes to pets and partners around the UK. People in North East England were more likely to ditch their partnerover their pet, followed by London , Northern Ireland , South West . [See table in editor’s notes below for regional breakdown.] Owners were asked what they loved most about their pets, with loyalty, unconditional love, loving nature, affection and a warm heart among the qualities cited. No matter how much love an animal gives, most pet ownerswould prefer a romantic Valentine’s night with their partner than one spent with their pet. Of male respondents,  per cent chose a night with their partner, compared with  per cent of female respondents. The figures were broadly similar across the country. Among the other popular traits cited by pet owners were: “they are so loyal and loving. And cute!” “unconditional love and loyalty” “they comfort me when I’m feeling blue” “doesnt argue or answer back” “they always cheer me up” “waggy tail and warm heart” and “her loving nature, always there for me when I need her”. One said: “Sometimes playful, sometimes cuddly, intelligent, independent, sometimes dangerous. All rather like my partner really.” Not everyone was totally enamoured with their pet. One said: “Nothing, it hates me, only loves my we”. And not all pets’ traits would make for a romantic night out – one said: “hassle free”, another said “doesn’t answer back” and one said “it’s a tortoise and he’s as indferent to use as we are to him”. Phil Turner-Naylor, head of marketing at Jollyes, said: “We’re known as a nation of animal lovers and this goes to prove it. When it comes to relationships, a lot people would choose their pet over their partner. “The good news for romantics though is that a big majority choose people over pets. What it does show, especially for men, is that partners have to work hard to keep the romance going or they might find themselves in the dog house. Women are looking for a romantic night with their partner on Valentine’s, butthe men don’t get it right, they had better watch out.”  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_fdddcacfeb   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_cfdafbcbdabffdad   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1645089617694.jpg--1_700_people_apply_for_a_life_less_ordinary_with_stena_line.jpg?164508961700","title":"  people apply for a life less ordinary with stena line ","story":"Ferry company Stena Line has been overwhelmed with the positive response from the public to its recent recruitment campaign ‘A Le Less Ordinary’, which aims to fill  vacant positions onboard its Irish Sea ferries. , applications were received from people across the UK and Republic of Ireland. The campaign promoted the unique nature of le onboard, with % time-off providing the perfect work-le balance for people wanting to live and work onboard for either a one or two-week sht and then spend equal time off. The positions available are part of the Onboard Sales and Servicesteam, with vacancies for service assistants and chefs. With January being the traditional time of the year when many people look for a new career, Stena Line had hoped for a favourable response but even the most optimistic of predictions could not have expected it to be so over-subscribed. Stena Line has now undertaken the initial stage of the selection process and, for the first-time, is hosting two Open Days for prospective candidates on Monday th February, where they will get a chance to meet members of Stena Line’s crews. The Open Days are taking place in Belfast and Birkenhead with the latter being held onboard one of Stena Line’s newest ferries, Stena Edda, giving candidates a chance to get a first-hand taste of le onboard on the Irish Sea. Stephen Bryden, Stena Line’s Head of Onboard Sales and Services, commented on the success of the campaign: “I am astonished by the public’s response to the A Le Less Ordinary recruitment campaign. We have never received so many applications. It really goes to show how many people are attracted to a le at sea with a company like Stena Line. Now our HR team has the challenge of how to sort and interview so many applicants, but that is a nice challenge to have.
