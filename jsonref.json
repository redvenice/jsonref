We should never forget these companies’ empires are built upon the hard work of their employees.‘Rest assured, we will be exploring every available legal avenue to protect our members’ jobs.’Sainsbury’s confirmed the two supermarket chains are in advanced talks about a merge (Picture: PA)Joanne McGuinness, Usdaw national officer, said: ‘Our priorities will be to protect our members and ensure any deal between the retailers does not impact on their jobs or incomes.Asda is owned by the world’s largest supermarket retailer Walmart and it is not yet clear how the deal would be structured.Completely intact badger pelt found in homeowner\u0027s gardenOne option is Sainsbury’s absorbing Asda stores, while Walmart take a large stake in the combined group.‘Sainsbury’s confirms that it and Walmart Inc are in advanced discussions regarding a combination of the Sainsbury’s and Asda businesses.

You may see a recreational regime here in the next five years as well.’Max Zavet: ‘We see the UK as a huge opportunity to expand in’ (Picture: Jen Mills)He spent several days in London to make contacts in the hope of expanding his business once the laws have changed.‘It could start with export, but eventually the UK will probably want a domestic-grown product,’ he said.Emblem, which produces and sells dried flower as well as cannabis oils, is one of 14 companies who presented at the Cannabis Invest conference at the May Fair Hotel.The exclusive London hotel is not necessarily where you’d expect to find businessmen and high net worth investors discussing the THC content of ‘premium flower’.Cannabis Invest: Not your typical stoners (Picture: Jen Mills)Those attending were almost exclusively in suits and cufflinks, with only one sequinned jacket in sight.Some present admitted they had never even tried cannabis, but were there because they saw it as an exciting investment.It shows how far the drug has come in being seen as acceptable, with canapés and glass bottles of San Pellegrino offered to guests – rather than a large order of Pizza Hut.Emblem operates legally in CanadaMany of those presenting were Canadian, which makes sense as the country will make recreational use fully legal by September this year. Brits in attendance were more likely to be listening than leading the sessions.Max believes UK industry as a whole will lose out because businesses will be playing catch-up once it is made legal (although one of the largest cannabis companies in the world, GW Pharmaceuticals, is based in Britain).‘The UK is on the forefront of most industries, but I think the culture is maybe a little too conservative, and is afraid of a new substance to harm children and harm society,’ he said.‘That’s even though people are consuming it regularly anyway.’The conference at the May Fair Hotel (Picture: Jen Mills)It’s obviously simpler for cannabis-based companies to operate if the drug is legal, because investors won’t be afraid it’s an illegal operation so it will be easier to raise capital.This has put US companies at a disadvantage, even in states where it is legal, because banks are federally regulated and at a governmental level cannabis is still outlawed.The Home Office insists it has no plans to relax the laws in Britain, describing cannabis as a ‘harmful drug’.It has been linked to schizophrenia and depression, with the Royal College of Psychiatrists warning of the ‘risk of serious consequences for people, such as the development of an enduring psychotic illness, particularly in those who are genetically vulnerable.’However, despite this many are optimistic the laws will soon change.Travis Wong, who used to be an investment banker in London, also attended the conference and hopes to move into the UK market.‘In the future we would love to look into Europe and London,’ he told .‘In a lot of markets there’s a two-step process. They always start with allowing medical access, having a regulated market for patients who want THC and CBD to help with pain management.‘As soon as people start realising the world isn’t blowing up and it’s not a gateway drug and there’s not people high on cannabis all the time, the second phase is to go recreational.’‘From what I recall, the UK has a relatively high level of recreational usage.‘Public opinion will shift very quickly.‘Everyone can see it being a global shift in public opinion.’Cannabis in its raw form is not recognised in the UK as having any medicinal benefit.It is subject to strict controls, which means it cannot be prescribed or supplied to the public, and can only be used for research under a Home Office licence.Despite this, the UK is one of the largest producers and exporters of legal cannabis to other countries. GW Pharmaceuticals has a licence to grow it for medical use to create its brands Sativex and Epidiolex, used to treat MS and epilepsy.Many places around the world have legalised medical cannabis (Picture: Getty Images)A Home Office spokesman told  the government has no plans to legalise cannabis, medicinally or otherwise.They said: ‘Cannabis is a controlled Class B drug, as there is clear scientific and medical evidence that it is a harmful drug, which can damage people’s mental and physical health, as well as harming iniduals and communities. The government is ‘absolutely committed’ to reducing drug use, they added.Uruguay was the first country to fully legalise cannabis in 2013. In Canada, cannabis is expected to become legal for recreational use nationwide in August or September this year.Alaska, California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Vermont, Washington and Washington DC have legalised cannabis for recreational use, and dozens of states allow it for medical use.Many other countries allow it for medical use, including Israel, Italy, Denmark and Finland.Thousands of people gathered in London’s Hyde park on April 20, AKA 420 Day (Picture: Rex)Germany, Italy and Australia have recently relaxed their laws and are seen as exciting markets within the industry.‘I think the UK is probably going to take its regulation guidance from Canada, like Australia has,’ Max said.‘Yes the the UK is late, but there could be a robust and viable domestic industry. It could be a springboard to the rest of Europe.’MORE: This bloke’s been photographing his marijuana plants for over 30 yearsMORE: More than 5,000 weed smokers flock to Hyde Park for 420"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/23/08/04AC68ED00000514-0-image-a-2_1524469795473.jpg","title":"Prince Louis Cambridge takes place royal order succession","story":"Here is how the line of succession looks now that Kate and William\u0027s new royal baby has been bornFollowing the baby\u0027s arrival, Prince Harry  shifts down the line of succession to sixth place.The Duke of York, who was born second in line, has moved to seventh and Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie to eighth and ninth.Andrew falling out of the top six means he will no longer have to ask the Queen for permission to marry - unlike Charles, William, George, Charlotte and Harry. Kate Middleton royal baby LIVE: First pictures as Duchess of...Kate\u0027s in Labour! Duchess of Cambridge is rushed to Lindo...Pippa\u0027s timely baby \u0027tip-off\u0027: How news she is \u0027expecting in...Share this articleThe first six people in the line of succession must have the Queen\u0027s consent before they can marry on May 19, as set out by the Succession to the Crown Act 2013.The act\u0027s introduction also saw sex removed as a determining factor in the line of succession.It has also been claimed that the royal baby has been born a commoner.Royal historian Marlene Koenig told Town and Country: \u0027It sounds complicated, but in the UK, the only people who are not commoners are the Sovereign and peers of the realm, (people with titles like) Duke, Marquess, Earl, Viscount, and Baron.\u0027          Millions of people around the world watched as the newborn prince was brought out onto the steps outside the hospital on Monday          The child will change the current line of succession, but the first four in line will stay the sameIt was always thought that William and Kate would go on to have three children. Kate is one of three and had a happy home life with her sister, Pippa Matthews, and brother, James Middleton, and is close to both of her siblings.But William may need to adjust to caring for a newborn once again.Kate joked in the months leading up to her due date that her husband was \u0027in denial\u0027 about having a third.By having more than two children, William and Kate are following in the footsteps of the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh, who went on to have four children - although there was a gap of 10 years between their second child, Anne, and third, Andrew.As a sibling to both future king George and \u0027spare to the heir\u0027 Charlotte, the new baby is unlikely ever to be crowned sovereign.The Duke of York is the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh\u0027s third child, but when Andrew was born in 1960 he leapfrogged his older sister, Princess Anne, in the line of succession.The Cambridges\u0027 third child  will no longer be allowed to jump ahead of older sister Charlotte in the line of succession.Previously, under the ancient rules of male primogeniture, royal sons took precedence over their female siblings, even leapfrogging first-born royal daughters.But a radical shake-up of the royal succession rules removed discriminatory male bias and came into force in March 2015, affecting babies born after October 28 2011.    The newest member of the royal family  is His Royal Highness Prince Louis of CambridgeThe newest member of the royal family has been named Louis Arthur Charles. The baby will be known as His Royal Highness Prince Louis of Cambridge.           Lord Louis Mountbatten, who was a British statesman and naval officer          Lord Louis Mountbatten , the last Governor General from Britain waving a cheery farewell to the crowds in Delhi          Lord Louis Mountbatten wearing the Veterans of Foreign Wars Merit AwardOther famous Louis\u0027: The name is also shared by Louis Tomlinson, the singer-songwriter from One Direction.

He has a son with now-ex-girlfriend Briana Jungwirth.Louis Armstrong was a world-renowned musician and singer, perhaps best known for his rendition of What a Wonderful World.Born and raised in New Orleans, USA, his instantly recognisable gravelly voice and unparalleled trumpet skills saw him rise to prominence in the jazz scene during the 1920s.He enjoyed a long career ning five decades, culminating with his induction into the Rhythm \u0026amp Blues Hall of Fame in 2017. Louis Vuitton was a French fashion designer who lived from 1921 to 1892. He went from poverty in rural France and trekked into Paris before becoming the apprentice to a box-maker.He later launched his own brand and was hired as personal box maker and packer to the Empress of France, under Napoleon III. Since his death, a fashion brand bearing his name has become a global brand. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/27/10/4B9AEFAF00000578-5663951-image-a-4_1524820367410.jpg","title":"Model reveals secret relationship Avicii planning children","story":"    Family: Avicii\u0027s girlfriend, model Tereza Kačerová revealed in a letter posted on Instagram that they were in a serious relationship and that Avicii was a doting step-father to her son Lucas          Secret is out: She writes that she wanted to keep their relationship private due to the \u0027madness\u0027 of Avicii\u0027s fame          Doting: The emotional open letter reveals that Avicii had a close relationship with Ms Kačerová\u0027s son and that they were planning to have children of their own in the future\u0027Dear Tim, \u0027 Ms Kačerová writes in the letter to the late 28-year-old. \u0027I\u0027ve spent the last days waiting to wake up, waiting for someone to tell me this is some sick joke, some awful mistake.

He tweeted this around 9.30am PST  West was spotted walking out of his Calabasas studio with a smoothie in one hand and his cell phone in the otherChance, whose father is a Democratic operative in Chicago who worked for future president Barack Obama, also shared a lengthy statement explaining he only wanted to support West, whom he called such a mentor that he felt like family.\u0027Anyone who knows me knows how passionate I am about my city and my loved ones,\u0027 began Chance. \u0027Kanye West in just a mentor or big brother to me. He\u0027s my family. No matter how much I may disagree with him, it\u0027s hard to watch people talk about someone I love-- even if they were justified in doing so. I didn\u0027t speak up because I agreed with what Kanye had to say or cause I fuck with Trump, I did it because I wanted to help my friend and cause I felt like I was being used to attack him.\u0027\u0027I\u0027d never support anyone who has made a career out of hatred, racism and discrimination,\u0027 Chance tweeted in reference to Trump.Chance said his comments were ill-timed but that Chicago has had \u0027generations of Democratic officials with no investment or regard for black schools, neighborhood(s) or black lives.\u0027          Several fans have tweeted that West may be experiencing a mental breakdown, but Chance cleared the air on that assumption as well          That tweet was followed by another that read: \u0027Next President gon be independent\u0027          Kanye West fans and supporters have been left ided after he traded adoring tweets with President Donald Trump, but Chance the Rapper has come to his defense          West and Chance the Rapper at the Magnificent Coloring Day Festival at Comiskey Park in Chicago in 2016\u0027We have to talk honestly about what is happening and has been happening in this country and we have to challenge those who are responsible, as well as those who are giving them a pass,\u0027 said Chance, whose charity last year pledged $2.2 million for arts programs in Chicago public schools.West met Trump in 2016 after the rapper cut short a tour following a breakdown. But West has said little about why he admires the real estate tycoon, who came to political prominence promoting unfounded conspiracy theories about Obama\u0027s place of birth.West tweeted on Friday: \u0027I haven\u0027t done enough research on conservatives to call myself or be called one. I\u0027m just refusing to be enslaved by monolithic thought.\u0027Chance was joined by Kanye\u0027s wife Kim Kardashian who also rushed to his defense after he blasted former president Barack Obama.\u0027He\u0027s a free thinker, is that not allowed in America? Because some of his ideas differ from yours you have to throw in the mental health card?\u0027 Kim tweeted. \u0027That\u0027s just not fair. He\u0027s actually out of the sunken place when he\u0027s being himself which is very expressive,\u0027 she added. West put his love for Donald Trump on full display as he donned his MAGA hat while leaving his California studio not long after he traded adoring tweets with the president.            Chance the Rapper\u0027s apology about his defense of Kanye in full          Chance also hit back at Trump after he praised the rapper for \u0027getting it\u0027 The rapper was spotted walking out of his Calabasas studio with a smoothie in one hand and his cell phone in the other.Along with his MAGA hat, he sported a pair of dark shorts, sneakers and a t-shirt, accompanied by a light grey jacket as he chatted with his entourage. His public appearance came shortly after he exchanged tweets with the president earlier on Wednesday. West proclaimed that the mob \u0027can\u0027t make me not love\u0027 Trump and praised the President\u0027s \u0027dragon energy\u0027. \u0027You don\u0027t have to agree with trump but the mob can\u0027t make me not love him,\u0027 he wrote. \u0027We are both dragon energy. He is my brother. I love everyone. I don\u0027t agree with everything anyone does. That\u0027s what makes us iniduals.\u0027 He later revealed that his MAGA hat is signed by the President himself, posting a picture of the accessory, which itself prompted another reply from Trump which simply read: \u0027MAGA!\u0027 Trump later retweeted the message and wrote: \u0027Thank you Kanye, very cool!\u0027           Chance the Rapper and Kim Kardashian were both quick to rush to West\u0027s defense on Wednesday after he blasted former president Barack Obama.          But Kardashian later took to her own Twitter to defend her husband, tweeting around 12.30pm PST that her husband was \u0027years ahead of his time\u0027          Less than an hour later at 10.30 PST, West tweeted that his wife Kim Kardashian had called him about the Trump tweet          Kardashian (pictured with West in a recent family photo) was a vocal supporter of Clinton during the 2016 presidential election campaign Later on Wednesday evening, West turned his attention to former president Barack Obama, tweeting: \u0027Obama was in office for eight years and nothing in Chicago changed.\u0027 However, he declared his respect for Hillary Clinton, writing \u0027I love Hillary too\u0027.Kanye then retweeted a post in which President Trump was expressing his excitement about meeting Apple CEO Tim Cook with the caption: \u0027Can\u0027t wait to meet\u0027.Next he posted a photo of Trump and Cook speaking together and said \u0027caption this photo\u0027.  Seconds later he wrote: \u00272 of my favorite people\u0027 before retweeting Trump\u0027s \u0027MAGA\u0027 tweet again. After that he posted messages which had apparently been sent by popular New York radio host Ebro Darden that seemed to discuss the rapper\u0027s support for Trump.          Trump later retweeted the message on his page and wrote: \u0027Thank you Kanye, very cool!\u0027           The president then tweeted the photo of the hat with \u0027MAGA!\u0027          West even tweeted a picture of himself in a Make America Great Again hat (pictured here with music mogul Lyor Cohen in center and an unidentified man)          Around 12.30pm PST West posted a picture of his MAGA hat to show that it had been signed by Trump himself          Chance\u0027s tweet also caught the attention of the president\u0027s son, Donald Trump Jr, who retweeted it           At 1pm PST he tweeted a screen grab of Trump\u0027s retweet - posted half an hour earlier - which he had seen from mediatkd, a Kanye West Twitter fan page\u0027And in a few years when someone else says the same exact thing but they aren\u0027t labeled the way he is and you will all praise them! Kanye is years ahead of his time.\u0027  Kardashian also hit back at the media, which she said was trying to \u0027demonize\u0027 West.  \u0027Your commentary on Kanye being erratic \u0026amp his tweets being disturbing is actually scary,\u0027 she wrote. \u0027So quick to label him as having mental health issues for just being himself when he has always been expressive is not fair.\u0027 Don Jr jumped in to show his support for Kardashian, retweeting her defense of West and adding #ImWithHer - the hashtag originally used to show support for Clinton during the 2016 presidential election.West\u0027s public support for Trump even made its way into the discussion at the White House press briefing on Wednesday. A reporter asked Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders if Trump had reached out to West following the rapper\u0027s recent praise. \u0027I don\u0027t know of any conversation that they\u0027ve had over the last week or so, I\u0027ll keep you posted if that changes,\u0027 Sanders said, breaking into a smile.  \u0027I know they met during the transition, that\u0027s the only meeting I\u0027m aware of that\u0027s taken place, or conversation.\u0027   West first revealed his support for Trump shortly after the November 2016 election, when he told a California concert audience he would have voted for the Republican.\u0027I told y\u0027all I didn\u0027t vote, right? But if I would\u0027ve voted, I would\u0027ve voted for Trump,\u0027 he said. \u0027We live in a racist country. That is a fact. This world is racist, OK?

And they were wealthy enough to employ six servants, socialise with the great and good of Leeds, and involve themselves in the politics of the day.

Together, the tentacles of their influence reached across the city.But the family was also struck by tragedy.Arthur’s wife Harriot, who was a cousin of Beatrix Potter’s mother Helen, died in childbirth in 1888, at the age of 35, before her famous cousin published her first children’s book The Tale of Peter Rabbit, leaving her husband a widower with three children Arthur, two, Elinor, one, and baby Elizabeth.

Within 11 months he was dead. A year later his father Arthur succumbed to grief.It was Hugo Lupton, son of Arthur’s younger brother Hugh and cousin of Kate’s great-grandmother Olive, who was responsible for linking the Luptons to Arthur Ransome.An old Wellingtonian and Trinity College alumnus, who won a Military Cross for his service in France, he married the author’s sister Joyce in 1920 and had four children Francis, in 1921, Arthur, in 1924, Cecily, in 1927, and Geoffrey, in 1930, ensuring the name Arthur went down through the generations.

Her paternal grandfather and uncle were both known as Charlie, although they were both christened Stephen Charles.The elder Charlie Goldsmith – Kate’s great-grandfather – was born at home in Acton, Middlesex, in 1886, and brought up in Southall. When he left home he lived in Uxbridge, where he worked as a mechanic and met his future wife Edith.A tiny woman, under 5 ft tall and weighing 7 stone, she was disfigured by a huge scar on her torso, which she had got during a narrow escape from death when she was a toddler.‘Grandad used to light his cigar in his big oil stove in the hall of the big house where they lived,’ his daughter Alice Tomlinson, the only one of his children still alive at 106 told me.‘He would roll a piece of paper up and put it in the stove and light his cigar. of course, when he went out, my mum copied. She had a go doing the same thing and nearly burned herself to death.’Charlie and Edith got married at Uxbridge Register office in 1909. She was four months pregnant with their eldest child, whom they named after his father.When Charlie Jnr was five years old, his father signed up, serving in France with the Royal Fusiliers, initially in the trenches and afterwards in the cookhouse. He was one of Kitchener’s ‘shilling men’.Luckily, he survived the war but returned home with emphysema. The father-of-six died in 1938, when his oldest son Charlie was 28 years old, and his youngest son, Kate’s grandfather Ronald was just six years old. His widow Edith was forced to move into a condemned flat and go to work at the local factory.Less than a century later, their great-granddaughter is living in Kensington Palace.  "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/27/20/4B77441D00000578-0-image-m-21_1524856582755.jpg","title":"Is royal baby look like","story":"    How a forensic artist predicted Prince Louis of Cambridge will look in years to comeThe Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have finally revealed the name of their newborn son, and this is how he could look in years to come.A forensic artist, who is based in Washington D.C, studied recent photographs of Prince William, Kate and their two eldest children.Joe Mullins then put together an image of what he predicts Prince Louis will look like in the future.According to Mr Mullins\u0027 predictions the youngster will have blue eyes, dark blonde hair and full cheeks.He has previously released images of what he predicted Prince George and Princess Charlotte would look like as they grew up.At the time Mr Mullins\u0027 pictures suggested that the children would both have dark hair and blue eyes.  Royalists and bookmakers alike have waited patiently since Monday to find out the name of the new arrival and fifth in line to the throne.     Joe Mullins has previously released images of what he predicted Prince George and Princess Charlotte would look like as they grew upThe name serves as a poignant tribute to Prince Charles\u0027 beloved great-uncle, mentor and \u0027honorary grandfather\u0027, Lord Mountbatten, who was killed in 1979 when the IRA placed a bomb in his fishing boat.   More than 100,000 bets were placed across the UK betting industry on the baby name, with both Albert and Arthur leading the way as the bookmakers\u0027 favourite.Legoland to give free entry to anyone called Louis after...Share this articleBut William and Kate have plumped for a moniker used for centuries across the Channel by the French, who have had 18 kings called Louis.    Following the baby\u0027s arrival, Prince Harry shifts down the line of succession to sixth place. The Duke of York, who was born second in line, has moved to seventh and Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie to eighth and ninth.             According to Mr Mullins\u0027 predictions the youngster will have blue eyes, dark blonde hair and full cheeksAndrew falling out of the top six means he will no longer have to ask the Queen for permission to marry - unlike Charles, William, George, Charlotte and Harry.The first six people in the line of succession must have the Queen\u0027s consent before they can marry on May 19, as set out by the Succession to the Crown Act 2013.The act\u0027s introduction also saw sex removed as a determining factor in the line of succession.It has also been claimed that the royal baby has been born a commoner.Royal historian Marlene Koenig told Town and Country: \u0027It sounds complicated, but in the UK, the only people who are not commoners are the Sovereign and peers of the realm, Duke, Marquess, Earl, Viscount, and Baron.\u0027  It was always thought that William and Kate would go on to have three children.Kate is one of three and had a happy home life with her sister, Pippa Matthews, and brother, James Middleton, and is close to both of her siblings.But William may need to adjust to caring for a newborn once again.Kate joked in the months leading up to her due date that her husband was \u0027in denial\u0027 about having a third.By having more than two children, William and Kate are following in the footsteps of the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh, who went on to have four children - although there was a gap of 10 years between their second child, Anne, and third, Andrew. Is this what royal baby could look like?

Elphicke denies both accusations and says he spent evening having supper with his mother.Officers also say a second woman alleges he ‘lunged’ at her in lift after drinks at Commons in 2015. Elphicke denies it.Police make no mention of alleged rape claim.At that time he was summoned to a meeting with the two Whips, including Mr Smith, where he was told the woman had accused him of sexual misconduct and failure to pay her wages in full.Mr Elphicke said the allegations were ‘b******s’ and denied failing to pay her, saying the payment was ‘being processed’.

Police told the MP that the woman claimed he had ‘put his arm around her and leaned in to kiss her’ in a Commons lift in May 2015 after they had drinks in Parliament’s Pugin Room.Mr Elphicke denied it and said the woman’s claim was undermined by the fact that in the intervening period she had stayed in touch and regularly asked him out to drinks and dinner. He showed police one text message which she signed off with a friendly ‘X.’The MP had first met the lobbyist as part of his work for the Commons Treasury Select Committee. They had also discussed the possibility of her working for him as a press officer.That became impractical after the 2015 Election, when Mr Elphicke became a Whip – by custom, office holders do not speak in public. He invited her to the Pugin Room to break the news to her over a drink.Afterwards, he escorted her to the Commons exit via a lift.The MP told police they retained cordial relations for the next two and half years – until she complained to Tory HQ two days after his suspension in November 2017.Mr Elphicke declined to comment last night and Downing Street said: ‘We cannot comment on an ongoing police inquiry.’A spokesman for Mr Smith said he ‘robustly denied’ referring allegations against Mr Elphicke to police ‘in an effort to support suspension of the whip’ or that he knew of some allegations ‘some time before they were referred to the police’. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/28/23/4BA7E7A100000578-0-image-a-12_1524955729883.jpg","title":"Gosh Meghan POSH youve got Victoria Beckham leads new royal pal follows","story":"Keep cosy in an AllSaints jumper like MeghanMeghan Markle and Prince Harry marked International Women\u0026#39s Day 2018 with a visit to Birmingham aimed at inspiring girls to pursue careers in science, engineering and technology.Looking super chic, Meghan sported a nautical-inspired J.Crew coat over her black trousers and a white AllSaints jumper.

He also sustained a broken upper and low jaw, broken arms and internal injuries.

His father left farming to become a dental technician, and  the family subsequently moved to Santa Monica, California.When Dean was just nine-years-old, his mother died of cancer. Unable to look after his son alone, his father sent him to live with his aunt and uncle on a farm in Fairmount, Indiana, where he was raised in a Quaker background.

He dropped out in January 1951 to pursue an acting career full-time and moved to New York City.Three years later, he caught the attention of director Elia Kazan, while portraying a gay houseboy in the play, The Immoralist.   With John Steinbeck’s approval, Kazan cast Dean in a screen adaptation of Steinbeck’s novel, East of Eden, launching him into stardom. A lover of speed, he reportedly used part of his advance for East of Eden to buy a red convertible and a motorcycle. He later purchased a white Porsche Super Speedster, which he used to compete in road races.The contract for his next film, Giant, banned him from racing, but upon finishing the film, he traded in the Speedster for the more powerful Porsche 550 Spyder, which he nicknamed \u0027Little Bastard\u0027.           Giant, which starred Dean alongside Elizabeth Taylor, was the young actor\u0027s second filmOn the very same day as his fatal crash, a police officer fined Dean for going 65 mph in a 55 mph zone.

Shortly afterwards, Mr Elphicke was told the payment had gone through, the woman was withdrawing her complaint and the relevant files had been ‘destroyed’.Mr Elphicke’s friends also challenge the woman’s claim that he touched her leg while driving her to his constituency after the alleged ‘fondling’ incident.‘Much later in the day of the alleged leg touching, he dropped her off at a station so she could get the train home and she never mentioned it then or afterwards,’ said one.The ‘lunge’ complaint by a lobbyist surfaced two days after Mr Elphicke was suspended by Mr Smith. Police told the MP that the woman claimed he had ‘put his arm around her and leaned in to kiss her’ in a Commons lift in May 2015 after they had drinks in Parliament’s Pugin Room.Mr Elphicke denied it and said the woman’s claim was undermined by the fact that in the intervening period she had stayed in touch and regularly asked him out to drinks and dinner. He showed police one text message which she signed off with a friendly ‘X.’The MP had first met the lobbyist as part of his work for the Commons Treasury Select Committee. They had also discussed the possibility of her working for him as a press officer.That became impractical after the 2015 Election, when Mr Elphicke became a Whip – by custom, office holders do not speak in public. He invited her to the Pugin Room to break the news to her over a drink.Afterwards, he escorted her to the Commons exit via a lift.The MP told police they retained cordial relations for the next two and half years – until she complained to Tory HQ two days after his suspension in November 2017.Mr Elphicke declined to comment last night and Downing Street said: ‘We cannot comment on an ongoing police inquiry.’A spokesman for Mr Smith said he ‘robustly denied’ referring allegations against Mr Elphicke to police ‘in an effort to support suspension of the whip’ or that he knew of some allegations ‘some time before they were referred to the police’. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/28/23/4BA7E7A100000578-0-image-a-12_1524955729883.jpg","title":"Gosh Meghan POSH youve got Victoria Beckham leads new royal pal follows","story":"Keep cosy in an AllSaints jumper like MeghanMeghan Markle and Prince Harry marked International Women\u0026#39s Day 2018 with a visit to Birmingham aimed at inspiring girls to pursue careers in science, engineering and technology.Looking super chic, Meghan sported a nautical-inspired J.Crew coat over her black trousers and a white AllSaints jumper.

One of them, Jonas Bendiksen, a Norwegian photographer, has won international awards for his pictures of people just about as far away from home as can be – from isolated communities in newly independent states of the former Soviet Union to a book of photographs of urban slums around the world.Turning his camera toward the intimate, Bendiksen used the opportunity to track the arrival of his new baby daughter, Billie, through his wife Anna’s pregnancy to the birth. In publishing the pictures in Magnum’s book Bendiksen, who has a photojournalist’s distrust of the familiar, is apologetic about them. “These are some of the most important pictures I’ll ever take,” he notes. “But not because they are necessarily very interesting for others to see.” You have the sense he needn’t have worried.The picture on this page was the last of the home photographs Bendiksen took, showing Billie adrift on a table top amid the familiar plastic detritus of a children’s party.

The details of the merger will be spelled out in a Stock Exchange announcement on Monday morning but analysts have already spent the weekend crunching the numbers after the news leaked out on a grey Saturday afternoon. The Bernstein analyst Bruno Monteyne predicts the supermarket bosses could carve out cost savings of £600m on the back of the deal. The huge figure could mean heavy job losses at the two companies, which have already endured multiple rounds of head office and shopfloor cuts against a backdrop of an intensifying supermarket price war with the German discounters Aldi and Lidl.With a combined workforce of 360,000 and potentially hundreds of overlapping stores, retail experts predict seismic changes on the horizon as a result of the deal. It will automatically trigger a competition probe, which history suggests could force store sell-offs in a tough retail climate where there are likely to be fewer buyers than during more buoyant economic times when there was a space race among the big supermarket chains.Monteyne says the two retailers have different fortes that will enable them to improve the other’s performance: “Asda has been struggling in the UK to deal with both the threat of discounters and the growth of e-commerce, particularly in non-food,” he says. “It is also weak in private label, the biggest battlefield against discounters. Both of these are areas that Sainsbury’s excels in. Sainsbury’s weakness is pricing.”If the deal goes ahead, Walmart, which has owned Asda since 1999, will receive Sainsbury’s shares in exchange for Asda’s circa 600 supermarkets, becoming the company’s biggest shareholder. The combined group is expected to have a market value of £15bn, including debt.The deal understandably raises competition concerns. The enlarged Sainsbury’s group would have a huge share of the market in food, clothing, household goods and toy retailing. Sainsbury’s also owns the 800-store Argos chain while Asda’s assets include the George clothing and homewares brand, which is a major player at the no frills end of the market. Before the deal can be given a green light, economists at the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) are expected to spend months poring over a map of the combined group’s store network. They will scrutinise every location and test whether the choice of retailers, typically within a 10- to-15-minute drive of each other, is materially reduced by the deal. In areas where there is only an Asda and a Sainsbury’s, regulators would be expected demand disposals.The 2003 competition investigation into the Safeway deal took five months and eventually forced Morrisons to sell off 53 stores but retail experts predict assessing the competition implications of merging the UK’s second and third biggest retailer could take up to a year to do.The overlap between the two grocers’ stores is less than with other rivals because Sainsbury’s traditional heartland is the south-east while Leeds-based Asda is a major player in the north of the country. However, the TCC Global analyst, Bryan Roberts, says the number of affected stores could still be substantial. “It would be miraculous if there was less than a 100 places where you have got an Asda and a Sainsbury’s in close proximity,” he says. “A lot depends on the CMA and whether they reevaluate what competition means, given the growth of Aldi and Lidl as well as online.”The north-south ide between Asda and Sainsbury’s is also about more than geography as the two companies are culturally very different. Unlike Morrisons’ takeover of Safeway in the noughties, there are no plans to ditch either brand, a rationale explained by the lack of overlap in the demographics of their customer bases. While Asda, with its focus on everyday low prices, targets shoppers on tight budgets, Sainsbury’s aisles are a destination for the middle-classes with more emphasis on ethical sourcing and foodie treats. “You could not get two more different businesses and bringing them together will be a Herculean task,” concludes Roberts."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f66858b36163edc36e7577622d58a2d70e327ba6/131_0_3046_1828/master/3046.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a9d061affece8bb1277c217618548026","title":"saudi aramco appoints first woman to board","story":"World’s most profitable company recruits US oil executive Lynn Laverty Elsenhans in milestone move for Saudi ArabiaSaudi Aramco, the world’s most profitable company, has appointed a woman to its board, in a milestone move for Saudi Arabia, where only one-fifth of women work and there are very few female executives.The oil company, which made profits of $33.8bn (£25bn) in the first half of 2017 – $5bn more than second-placed Apple – said on Sunday it had recruited the American oil executive Lynn Laverty Elsenhans to its 11-member board.The appointment of Elsenhans, a former chief executive and chair of US oil refiner Sunoco, comes as the Saudi Arabian government prepares to float Saudi Aramco later this year or early in 2019. The initial public offering, which could take place in London, New York or Hong Kong, will be the world’s largest. Last year, the Saudi stock exchange appointed Sarah al-Suhaimi as its first female chair. She was the first woman to chair a major government financial institution in the kingdom. Elsenhans was named by Forbes magazine as one of the world’s most powerful women in 2008. Prior to her role at Sunoco, Elsenhans was a senior executive at Royal Dutch Shell, where she worked for more than 28 years.

Broadly, the response has been positive. Most readers accepted the change as partly a necessary cost-saving measure in the face of difficult market conditions for newspapers. Expressions of loyalty towards the  were a tonic. “Don’t worry, dedicated supporters will keep your GREAT PAPER going,” wrote a devotee.At the beginning, 15 January, reflex responses – pro and con – had comparable intensity. But they soon gave way to a flow of thoughtful and detailed emails and letters. Some who welcomed the smaller size also focused on how the redesign had perhaps moved, or for space reasons dropped, aspects of the paper which they enjoyed. Specific puzzles or weather details or listings were missed, but the overall response to the layout and pacing of the paper was approving. Some early resisters warmed to the changes, others said they had adapted.I put the main themes of readers’ responses to the designers and to the editor-in-chief, Katharine Viner. She is open to considering changes, within constraints of space and cost.Wrote one reader: “The main body of your excellent newspaper in my hands has developed migratory tendencies.” Readers commented on how they disassemble the paper and share parts of it for simultaneous reading among members of their household, or take only one section with them on the bus or train.The habits of many are matched by the stapled G2 and the well-received Journal section that can be removed whole from the centre of the main paper. Some lament that sport is no longer separate. A frequent request was for the main paper to be stapled, but the production process and the deadlines of the operation do not permit it.I am told the initial boost that novelty and promotion gave to newsstand sales has eased back now, but subscriptions since the change have grown strongly.A highly visible innovation was the introduction of patches of yellow. Adverse response was significant, and usage is being cut back. Viner says the technique will be used judiciously and “the randomness will stop”.Although various readers perceived the body type as smaller, the ink less intense and the paper itself perhaps different, I am assured that the font size of the body type is fractionally larger and the ink and paper are the same.The change of masthead drew attention, partly because some readers thought it didn’t draw enough attention to itself on newsstands among its competitors.

I hadn’t cried that hard since my father died 15 years ago. As three more members of my immediate family died in the decade following my dad’s death, I cried less for each one until, eventually, I had no more tears to shed whenever anything sad happened in my life.But the other night, I cried so hard and for so long that I began to wonder if the skin might dissolve away from all the salt running over it. This was triggered by a dear friend moving far away. As I’ve written before, living without parents, partner or dependents has led to me highly appreciate friendship. And though a wondrous thing about living in New York City these past 23 years has been that so many great people pass through this town, they are often doing just that: temporarily passing through. My heart aches each time a kindred soul leaves. Bidding my friend adieu cracked the dam long holding back a rising reservoir of tears. As a columnist, my impetus has been to inspire readers towards action and away from despair in moments of overwhelming sadness. But as I cried in the dark, I gave in to my frustration and despair for a change – and sat with my deep sadness about the state of the world on scales large and small. It was cathartic, and I was reminded that mourning isn’t a sign of weakness, but just of being human.And there is much to mourn right now. I began writing this column during an exciting moment in American history, when LGBT rights were being won in state after state weekly or even daily. I was a bit optimistic about the United States right then. Liberty was on the march, and despite the depressing reasons for its necessity, the ascending spirit of the Black Lives Matter movement gave me a sense of hope. Then, much as I feared and predicted, the backlash roared mightily. From Brexit to Trump, white supremacist empire struck back at modest gains in racial, gender and sexual justice. In my scholarly life, I increasingly learned that such revanchism is not a deviation from US and British hegemony, but rather a repeating condition of their continued dominance. And with good reason, I have felt despondent about much of the news of the past couple of years. I feel sad about how the Anglo-American war machine grows and kills regardless of who’s living on Downing Street (May, Brown or Blair) or in the White House (Trump, Obama, Bush II, Clinton or Bush I). I feel sad about the relentless consolidation, manipulation, and whiteness of US and British media. And about the attacks on science , art, language and medicine. And I am disheartened about the unceasing, ableist and racist police killings. And about Ice raids and lethal transphobia. And about how often Americans call the police on black people for playing with toys, walking with a plumbing fixture, or using a plastic fork in a Waffle House or sitting in Starbucks. And about how black women are underpaid and rushed towards death. And about why “Black infants in America are now more than twice as likely to die as white infants – a racial disparity that is actually wider than in 1850, 15 years before the end of slavery, when most black women were considered chattel,” as Linda Villarosa recently wrote. And the increasing curtailing of sexual freedom through the merger of the state and tech. And about the shaming of the hungry – and the racist lack of power in Puerto Rico and safe water in Flint. Furthermore, the recent golden anniversaries of civil rights dates have been particularly dejecting. Despite a half century passing since the Kerner Commission Report and the assassination of Martin Luther King, there has been “no progress for African Americans on homeownership, unemployment and incarceration in 50 years” as a Washington Post headline surmised.What am I – what are any of us – to do with all this information?For a long time, I wrote and raged about such matters in a call to corrective action. But when that wall of tears flowed forth from my eyes, it occurred to me that perhaps it’s OK to not just be sad, but to sit with being sad.This is tough for me, for I come from a family of activists. My parents were racial justice activists. My sister Jinger and brother James were active in Occupy Los Angeles, and Jinger’s family is active in the “wwoofer” organic farming movement. My sister Catherine is also a committed racial justice activist, as are her inspirational and newsmaking daughters, April and Maddi. Through documenting America in journalism, I have strived to be like my kin in forcing change.But also in our family was my late sister Sharron, who often showed me how it is OK to slow down. As I wrote in 2016, “One of the last and most frightening lessons I learned with my sister in her final days was the importance of being with another when there is nothing to say or do. It is terrifying, to just be with a loved one and to admit you’re powerless to stop their death. But it can be the most powerful, quiet and loving gift you can give each other.”Right now, I am sitting with the importance of being with myself in life when I am unsure of what to do when there is nothing to say or do. It is indeed terrifying to just be with myself in grief or unknowing, and to admit I am powerless to stop every bad thing in the world which concerns me.But I am also considering that it might just be the most powerful, quiet and loving gift I can give myself – a gift which may empower me with time. As a psychologist, my sister Sharron would employ a metaphor about engaging grief which has stayed with me. For someone in mourning, approaching grief can be like moving towards an enormous, dark, cold lake. Not knowing how deep or cold it may be, the griever tries to go around the lake without getting in it. But the lake turns out not to be a lake at all, but rather an endless river. Trying to circumvent this body of water, the griever gets lost in weeds and bramble, straying ever farther from their path. Eventually, they have to get in the lake of grief and swim in its depths, unless they want to remain lost. To that end, this will be my final regular column for the . While I still believe writing is a valuable force for social change, I also believe it is important for writers to take time let our wells refill without publishing. And now it is time for me to not just sit with some sadness about the world, but to prepare for some positive developments in my journey. It is also time, after four years of conducting PhD research, to spend the next year writing my doctoral thesis in American studies at NYU. Then, in in the summer of 2019, I will join the faculty of Northwestern University as the inaugural Daniel H Renberg chair in media coverage of sexual and gender minorities – the first journalism professorship at a major university to focus on LGBTQ subjects and scholarship. Taking this time to be with my feelings and also to get a little smarter will allow me – I hope – to become a professor and empower me in new ways as a writer.I do hope to visit these pages again someday. But before I go, I want to say thank you to my fellow  journalists and to you, our readers, for the experience of a lifetime. It has been a great hono(u)r of my professional life to explore the US in these historic times in conversation with all of you.

In a series of panels, moderators pushed their guests to suggest things anyone watching could immediately do. Amani Al-Khatahtbeh, founder of MuslimGirl, encouraged people to share articles on social media that tell the story of marginalized people. Nina Shaw, founding partner at the law firm Del Shaw Moonves Tanaka Finkelstein and Lezcano, said women should push men to call out sexist behavior in other men. Jetmire Gjini, a hotel room attendant in New York, advocated for workplace unions. “When women are part of a strong union like men,” Gjini said, “they have the power to stand up and protect themselves without fear of retaliation”.Time’s Up announced its own new initiative, +13x, which encourages women to help other women at their workplace. Desiree Gruber, chief executive of the multi-media company Full Picture and executive producer of Project Runway, explained that “+1” stood for bringing another woman to any work meeting or event and “3x” stood for at least three other meaningful connections that woman could be helped to make. “Even if you are at the beginning of your career, there is something you could demystify for someone else in this office,” she said. Time’s Up also celebrated its own success with a panel on its Legal Defense Fund, which provides resources to people fighting sexual harassment in the workplace. The fund is managed with the help of the National Women’s Law Center (NWLC) and has raised more than $21m.Another trend the NWLC has spotted, she said, was that the men and women who approach it are often seeking legal help because they are being retaliated against with lawsuits or threatened legal action for reporting, or even just mentioning, sexual harassment. “The retaliation people face is real,” Graves said.As attorney Robbie Kaplan, of Kaplan \u0026amp Company, explained, the fund was meant to create an army of lawyers that would fight to show such behavior would no longer be ignored. Kaplan, who argued before the US supreme court in favor of legalizing same-sex marriage, said the fund was filling a gap.For decades, she said, people who were able to find attorneys to fight sexual harassment cases tended to be either high income or were “embarrassment cases”, making accusations against high-profile and powerful people. “Almost everyone else in the middle were having a very, very hard time finding representation,” Kaplan said. Time’s Up, she said, has heard from women in nearly every industry including food, construction and the military. Kaplan said the action she was seeing was reminiscent of the activism that helped make same-sex marriage legal.“It’s just like gay rights,” Kaplan said. “How did we get them? One person said, ‘I am gay,’ and then another, and another and another. It’s exactly the same here.”The only man on stage was a former NFL player, Wade Davis, who is gay. He works with corporations, sports teams and universities to improve the understanding of sexuality. To do this, he said, he has to educate men about feminist theory. “The root of homophobia is sexism,” he said.Asked what women in the audience could do to help promote feminism, Davis said it was men who needed to step up. “Women don’t have to do anything,” he said. “They’ve done everything. Anything smart I said today I learned from a woman.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2e33f1671c2c1ac0061cc4fbd71c911e930ae273/0_117_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4b403ed4bcb047fe6cca03425e1df2e6","title":"chris coleman sackedd manager sunderland","story":"Chris Coleman has left Sunderland and the chairman Ellis Short has agreed to sell the club on a dramatic day at the Stadium of Light.Sunderland first confirmed Coleman had been released from his contract, following their drop into League One.Minutes later they announced a deal had been struck to sell to a group led by Stewart Donald, the chairman of National League side Eastleigh.It will mark the end of Short’s turbulent ownership which has now seen Sunderland tumble from the Premier League to League One in less than 12 months.Short said in a statement: “It is no secret I have been trying to sell Sunderland but I have waited until the right group came along that have the experience, finances and plan to take this great club back to where it deserves to be.“Overall my chairmanship has not gone the way I would have wished the many high points of a decade in the Premier League have been overshadowed by the low points of the last two terrible seasons.“I was therefore determined to ensure that I leave Sunderland in the best possible hands and in the best possible state to turn the corner.“To achieve this, higher offers from less qualified buyers were rejected and I have paid off all debts owed by the club and leave it financially strong and debt free for the first time since years before I owned it.”The deal is subject to EFL approval and Donald has confirmed he has also put Eastleigh on the market.He said in a statement: “With my potential involvement in Sunderland, it is a condition that I must relinquish control of Eastleigh. If the rules were different I would have loved to remain with the club for many years to come.”The takeover came after Coleman left after the 47-year-old failed to stop the club slipping to successive relegations after they tumbled out of the Championship this month.He replaced Simon Grayson in November but won just five of his 29 games, losing 16 times.A Sunderland statement read: “Sunderland AFC announces that manager Chris Coleman and his assistant Kit Symons have been released from their contracts. The club would like to place on record its sincere thanks to Chris and Kit for their tireless efforts in what has been a hugely disappointing season for everyone involved with the club.

The gap from the bottom three has been shaved to an unnerving three points over the weekend and while there is no disgrace in losing to the champions, the manner in which Manchester City sauntered to this thrashing was disturbing. The near silence in the stands was significant.This actually felt like an escape given how many opportunities were created but passed up by Pep Guardiola’s side. City virtually declared in the latter stages with Yaya Touré strolling around central midfield and the teenage England youth international, Lukas Nmecha, leading the line on his league debut, for all that the ball still rarely left the home side’s half. West Ham, chasing shadows for all but a brief period ahead of the interval, had been pummelled into submission. David Moyes must somehow raise spirits for next weekend’s trip to Leicester, otherwise this season could have a sting in its tail.It was the kind of masterclass City tend to impose in this arena. Last season they had prospered 4-0 and 5-0 here, playing on West Ham’s insecurities and relishing the wide open spaces on offer. They should have rattled up a similar tally in the opening half-hour, so dominant were they tearing into jittery opponents. Ilkay Gündogan was close to converting Raheem Sterling early centre, though the home side had yet to enjoy any meaningful touches of the ball by the time Leroy Sané collected just outside the corner of the penalty area. Aaron Cresswell was reluctant to engage, allowing the German to cut in on his left foot and whip a shot which cannoned from Patrice Evra’s forehead to nestle in the far corner. Adrian, in for the ineligible Joe Hart, had been utterly wrong-footed by the deflection.Other opportunities were passed up before City inevitably celebrated a century of league goals, albeit with a reward utterly at odds with the beauty of so many of their tally this season. Adrian had actually done well to stifle Sterling’s run just outside his penalty area, but the visitors simply kept coming. The England forward’s follow-up was blocked by Angelo Ogbonna, but Gündogan calmly found Kevin de Bruyne on the overlap with the Belgian’s cross flicking off Adrian’s fingertips to bounce in off Declan Rice and Pablo Zabaleta. The Argentinean spent nine years at City, but he took no joy in registering their ton.This had always felt a rout in waiting. West Ham are the ision’s most porous defence and had been becalmed, sitting deep and permitting City their possession when other teams have shown in recent times that a more aggressive and smothering approach can yield reward against the champions. Perhaps Moyes determined his side lack the dynamism to swam into such a press, though they did muster a brief rally once the visitors, maybe overly confident in their advantage or possibly merely losing interest at the lack of a contest, allowed their upbeat tempo to drift just before the break.Marko Arnautovic was incensed to be penalised for a foul on Ederson which ruled out his tap into an empty net, but that at least woke up the home support with his team-mates rejuvenated even to have come relatively close. Within minutes, Gündogan had tripped Edimilson Fernandes just inside the box only for the officials to award a free-kick two yards outside it. That felt a significant oversight, only for Cresswell to belt the set-piece inside the goalkeeper’s near-post and apparently gain the home side their foothold.Except, of course, it actually only served to sting the visitors into a response. The majesty of their third goal took the breath away, from Gabriel Jesus’ wonderfully weighted and incisive pass which sent Sterling scurrying beyond Cresswell, to the winger’s clarity of thought as he contemplated his centre while West Ham flooded their penalty area. In darted Jesus unnoticed to collect from Sterling with a glorious first touch, disorientating Zabaleta in the process, then convert beyond Adrian from close range. It was the 15th time West Ham had conceded at least three goals in a league game this season.There was no stemming the tide from then on in. Sterling should have been awarded a penalty as Cresswell slid in, then was denied by Adrian, before turning provider again. Fernandinho had reclaimed the ball from Manuel Lanzini before liberating the winger yet again down the right, with Sterling again able to await reinforcements before finding the Brazilian with the return. The finish was crisp with the goalkeeper hopelessly exposed for goal number 102 of this term. West Ham, battered and bruised by it all, must have felt most had been plundered at their expense by the end."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d5ac33f9d4eb916830c49fa2acc60b6dcad3ddd0/0_13_3208_1926/master/3208.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2230c0457c84399618035846961bdcb1","title":"fiorentina v napoli serie a live","story":"29 min: Laurini crosses from the right and Simeone can’t get enough on his attempt at a glancing header. For Napoli, perhaps this is a case of keeping it goalless for a while and then going for it late on.28 min: Fiorentina don’t look especially capable of a breakthrough although they’re very much controlling possession.25 min: From the move that results, Napoli earn a corner – their first of the match. Can they snaffle something priceless here? Its a tricky one, and Sportiello has to paw it away from under his own crossbar. If only Koulibaly was on to attack it!24 min: A yellow card, there, for Laurini after a foul on Insigne.22 min: Napoli aren’t getting too much of the ball just now. Their attacking players are still on the pitch but can they get them the service from further back?19 min: ... which Veretout, the ex-Aston Villa man, curls over.18 min: Chiesa, who looks lively, wins Fiorentina another free-kick close to the edge of the box ...17 min: Insigne tries a long-range shot but it’s blocked. Napoli are doing OK at the moment it would certainly have been easy to sub a more creative player than Jorginho after the red card. Sarri knows they need to go for it, somehow.15 min: That entire VAR farrago took three minutes or so, by the way. I’m sure we are all looking forward to the World Cup.13 min: So while Juventus benefited from a red card yesterday, Napoli must battle one here. And they really need to win. What now?We’ve had all sorts of drama here – a VAR review has upgraded Coulibaly’s yellow card to a red, and downgraded the penalty to a free-kick, which was saved! Tonelli has come on to replace Jorginho for 10-man Napoli. What a start!A nightmare start for Napoli! Simeone chases down the middle and goes down under the challenge of Koulibaly ... it’s a yellow card for the defender, who could have been the last man there, and a spot kick is awarded!4 min: Reina has distributed the ball neatly a couple of times, while Insigne has tried to get one or two things going down the left. For now, though, little joy.2 min: It’s a fairly mellow start, Napoli seeing most of the ball. Will nerves, the fear of making an error, play any part after the high of last weekend?Can Napoli keep their challenge up?The teams are in the tunnel, a few backs are being slapped, and we’ll be getting underway before too long ...Imagine the celebrations if little-known Napoli – everybody’s favourite hipster side, I’ve heard! – won the league. You’d want to be there, to be fair. Today is absolutely crucial though ...Kick-off is at 5pm UK time.Serie A, eh? It’s where the drama is this season and I would say there is a fair chance of more today. Juventus’s dramatic win at Inter last night means Napoli, if they are to keep up the pressure created by their brilliant away win over the leaders, must keep on winning too – and it won’t be easy today.That’s because they face a Fiorentina side that, until recently, had won six in a row. Their form has stalled a bit they’ve lost their last two and drew at home with Spal before that, but it’s probably not the game you’d want in this situation and the pressure is very much on for Maurizio Sarri and company.Can Napoli bring a thrilling conclusion to the season a step closer? Or will Fiorentina put the title firmly in Juve’s hands and render all last weekend’s celebrations a little but premature?

But if you wanted to, Kolasinac is a decent candidate for the familiar trope of declining expectations. He started out as a terrific lump of muscular, marauding attacking wing-backery, and now, on today’s basis at least, he’s become just a terrific lump. But as with the game as a whole, it’s hard to care at the moment.”48 min Maitland-Niles makes a surging run into the United area, only to mishit a left-footed shot that takes a double deflection and bounces through to De Gea. It was a lovely run though.47 min Crikey, what a statistic this is from the folks on Sky Sports. United have led at half-time in 268 Premier League games at Old Trafford. They’ve won 253, drawn 15 and lost none.47 min “The 2-4 at Highbury in 2005 is my favourite,” says Liam Moseley. “Arsenal were at the end of a cycle United were at the beginning of theirs. Neither side were anywhere near winning the league yet the game so was intense and full of hatred for one another that it made a compelling and thrilling encounter. There hasn’t been a game like it in the Premier League since.”Yeah, what I like about that game is that it meant absolutely nothing and absolutely everything. Chelsea were also going to win the league, but by then Arsenal and United loathed each other so much that context was irrelevant. It was just wonderful.46 min Peep peep! United begin the second half of this“Hi Rob,” says Ted Lee. “I had to staff a computer fair the day of the 1999 semi-final replay, so I couldn’t watch the game. There were no smartphones back then, limited internet connectivity where I was, and it was still a time where to watch the I had to drive 40 minutes at 6 a.m. on a Saturday to find a sports bar carrying Setanta. But the FA Cup game was being televised, so I recorded it at home and it wasn’t too hard to avoid the result. I turned on the TV before rewinding my VCR, and the TV tuner was on the station it was recording and in that odd way you hear the TV’s audio for a couple of seconds before the video came on, I heard what was unmistakably Ferguson’s voice say ‘We got out of jail.’ I muted the TV to not hear any more and very much enjoyed the next two hours.” I bet you enjoyed minutes 69-109 a lot more than most United fans did. Peep peep! United lead through Paul Pogba’s goal in a subdued match. Arsenal’s reserves have played some nice stuff and probably deserve to be level.45 min “I still love the 6-2 in the Rumbelows Cup,” says Anthony Perrin. “Wallace and Sharpe on the rampage. United were around 25 years without the league and Arsenal had been exchanging league titles. It made be break the tab on my VHS so it couldn’t be recorded over. That was a massive commitment in the early Nineties.”I got the worst mark of my life in an exam the next day, having been far too giddy to do any last-minute revision, or care less about the exam itself. I’d like to say I was also giddy about Thatcher resigning that day, but that would be a bald-faced one.44 min A cross from the right is headed wide from 12 yards by the flying Nelson. It was a decent enough effort. There wasn’t much pace on the ball so he had a lot of work to do, and he couldn’t do it.41 min Young’s mishit cross from the left smacks off the outside of the near post!40 min Xhaka, already booked, is penalised for handball. Kevin Friend decides not to give him a second yellow, presumably because it was a misjudgement rather than a cynical handball.39 min “Surprised you have got this far without anyone mentioning the 1979 Cup Final yet,” says Nicholas Porritt. “A vivid childhood memory made more memorable because there was so little live football back then. At that time Arsenal really were vile, barely above Leeds United in the popularity stakes and encapsulated perfectly by the Willie Young foul the following year. That Man Utd team was typical of the post-Busby, pre-Fergie United: stylish, expensive, but ultimately unreliable and disappointing. The Jaguar of the Football League. You couldn’t help falling in love with them.”Dave Sexton’s United stylish, really? It was before my time, but I’ve read one or two alternative appraisals.38 min A bit of pinball in the Arsenal area ends with a shot from Lukaku that deflects off Bellerin and is easily saved by Ospina.37 min Back in the year 2018, Arsenal are having an excellent spell. As Martin Tyler says on Sky, an equaliser wouldn’t be undeserved.GOAL! Manchester United 0-1 Arsenal (Wiltord 57) Arsenal are surely going to be champions now! Sylvain Wiltord has continued their record of scoring in every game and taken them to the brink of glory. Ljungberg, inevitably, was involved. He ran through a woolly challenge from Blanc and hit a shot that was pushed away by Barthez. It came to Wiltord, who slid it nonchalantly into the net with his left foot!36 min Aubameyang misses an excellent chance, heading weakly at De Gea from 10 yards after a good cross from Bellerin.34 min Has anyone trademarked the phrase “end-of-season feel”?31 min “Mkhitaryan so far looks like he never left,” says Adam Roberts. “Some nice touches but rubbish at crucial points.”30 min After a decent United break, Lingard’s long-range shot is blocked by the trailing leg of Chambers. He should have played in Valencia on the right.27 min Maitland-Niles clips a quick pass into the area for Aubameyang, who can’t make room for a shot. Arsenal have played some lively stuff going forward.26 min Arsenal have two unsuccessful penalty appeals in 20 seconds. The first was a Mkhitaryan e, the second was a tackle by Sanchez on Maitland-Niles. I don’t think it was a penalty.25 min Pogba’s free-kick hits the wall and deflects to Sanchez, who is offside.24 min Xhaka is booked for a foul on Lingard 25 yards from goal. Pogba will want a piece of this.23 min “One of the saddest things is that if you’d told someone 10 years ago that there’d be an Arsenal-United game in late April, with no impact on the title race, with neither team anywhere near winning the title, no one would have believed you,” says AB Parker. “This game has a look of a preseason friendly at the moment. With the team we’ve put out, United should be battering us.” 21 min “One of my least favourite footballing games in history has to be Arsenal 1-2 United in Nov 2014, in which Arsenal had about 300 shots on goal and United had one,” says Jordan Pickering. “One shot on goal and they came away with a 2-1 victory. It so encapsulates what it means to be an Arsenal supporter.”20 min Mkhitaryan almost equalises after a fine move. Bellerin crossed low to Maitland-Niles, who flicked a dainty backheel to Mkhitaryan on the edge of the box. He took a touch and drove a low shot just wide of the far post.19 min “My favourite ArsenalUnited moment is more down to circumstance than any actual investment in the rivalry,” says Matt Dony. “I’m a Liverpool fan, who also harbours a fairly intense dislike of Wenger and Arsenal (but my word, do I respect him!) Anyway, May 2002, I spent a Monday night watching Bob Dylan in Cardiff CIA (followed by drinking in a hotel bar being bored by Ebdon’s slow slow victory, but that’s another story). I spent the next few days staying at a friend’s house, the smuggest United fan I know, still on a giddy, Dylan-induced high. I did not particularly want Arsenal to win the league that fateful Wednesday, but the fact that I got to enjoy my friend’s disappointment, anger, and dejection at Wiltord’s goal was a wonderful thing, having spent the previous few years having to tolerate his pride in Fergie’s success. Ah, magical memories. The future’s yours, the past is mine.”I didn’t find that game too distressing, weirdly. The title was gone. Losing to Leverkusen on away goals the week before now that was pain. 17 min Sanchez’s header was actually erted onto the post by Bellerin, an heroic and entirely futile intervention.United take the lead. Lukaku’s brilliant chipped cross was headed against the post by the flying Sanchez, and Pogba followed up to volley home from six yards.15 min Matic sprays a superb crossfield pass to Valencia, whose good cross is headed away by Chambers. United are having a lot of the game now.14 min “The defining match was 28 November 1992,” says Paul Hayes. “United had signed Cantona two days before and I was still reeling with shock. He was brilliant.and, let’s be honest, very tough. (He had even got me grudgingly admiring Leeds.) My father had brought me up on stories of the toughness of United players able to boss the opposition with skill and also physicality – Edwards and Stiles being his favourites. That steel had been developing – remember the United vs Arsenal brawl two seasons earlier, defining in the way that United began to compete in every aspect while not quite gelling.“But that’s not this story. In the end, Cantona wasn’t in team to face Arsenal. Instead Giggs was brilliant on the right wing and Lee Sharpe was quick on the lift and Hughes was bolshie, aggressive and bundled in an ugly goal bettering Adams after Giggs and then Sharpe had bettered Winterburn and Dixon, I think. The second half was dour, fractured and attritional but United clung on for a win this time. When I spoke with my father that evening I told him that United would win the league because they’re bloody tough physically and mentally and with Cantona in the team they’d have the flair to beat anyone.” 12 min United are slowly starting to dominate possession, though the game is still fairly flat.10 min “Hello Rob,” says Russell George. “My most vivid memory of United-Arsenal was probably the brawl in 1990. I was 16 at the time, sitting in the main stand at Old Trafford so had a pretty good view of it all. The crowd reaction that day was positively feral, both exhilarating and frankly pretty scary. If only OT had a little bit more of that I’d probably try and go a bit more. I also remember watching Grandstand when we were losing in the cup match in 88. The reporter was doing an update when we got the late penalty so they stayed with it. When McClair hit it over I was absolutely distraught. Still, there have been more happy times than sad. After we beat them 4-1 in the Michael Knighton game in 1989 I wrote a full-length report which I sent to Patrick Barclay at the Independent. I really wanted to be a football reporter at the time, and Patrick was gracious enough to ring me up one Sunday morning to say how much he liked my writing.”8 min Smalling pokes a pass towards Lingard, in space on the right of the box. He drills a low cross-shot that is kicked away from inside his own six-yard box by Chambers.7 min “Hi Rob,” says Brad McMillan. “As a United fan, it was a blessing that my best mate from school supported Arsenal. During that period, 1996-2005 (age 15-24 for us both), we were almost inseparable, and there’s no way either of us would have enjoyed it as much without the other. For both of us, Utd v Arsenal means growing up: girls, (not fast) cars and alcohol. The rest of the time was obviously squandered. Anyway, when I look back, my most prominent memories are Utd losing, specifically the Old Trafford defeats in 1998 and 2002. The next, possibly my favourite, is the feeling of incredulity when John O’Shea chipped in at Highbury I’m 2005. Keane-Vieira in the tunnel would have meant nothing without that cherry. Also, it now feels like the very last blow of that era - and Utd won, even if the league was Chelsea’s by then.”6 min United have started slowly, as they wont to do. Arsenal look much more sprightly, particularly the returning Mkhitaryan.5 min “This may be common knowledge,” says Doremus Schafer, “but I only just now realized that Bergkamp’s saved penalty strictly speaking should have been retaken for encroachment by Paul Scholes.”That’s a good spot. Can you imagine if David Elleray had ordered a retake? Roy Keane would have been straight out of his early bath to administer advice.4 min Matic’s mishit volley falls nicely for Pogba 10 yards out. He spins around, takes aim ... and shanks the ball well wide of the near post with his left foot.3 min It’s been a decent start from Young Arsenal, with lots of possession in the United half.2 min “Arsenal’s late win in 2007 over perhaps Ferguson’s greatest ever side (with the bonus addition of Henrik Larsson) always sticks in my mind, not so much for the quality of the football, which was probably excellent, but for Henry’s late headed winner,” says Matt Loten. “I’m sure he scored one or two others with his noggin over the years, but I struggle to recall any, and at such a crucial moment. Bit like Messi in the 2009 Champions League final.”That was the same game when he celebrated in Gary Neville’s face, wasn’t it?1 min Arsenal get the match under way.Sir Alex Ferguson has presented Arsene Wenger with a special memento on behalf of United. Jose Mourinho is in the mix as well. It’s a love-in! It’s an unlikely, moving scene, and a lovely touch from Ferguson. They’ve come a long way from the days when Wenger said he would “never talk about that man again”.The players emerge from the tunnel. Arsene Wenger follows them, and is applauded down the touchline by the United fans. There will be no Champions League final for Manchester City - their former player Lucy Bronze scored the winning goal against them for Lyon in the semi-final second leg.“Some great memories,” says Yoxall. “The 4-1 on the opening day 8990 was great we just didn’t expect it. The 99 cup game, the game at Highbury when RVN netted, and the tide turned in the title race, the superb counter in the Champions League and the 8-2. Plus all the various “battles”! But on a personal note, my son’s first game was the 2-1 where Arsene was sent to the stand but had nowhere to go. You never forget your first time! I’m sure we’ll give him a respectful reception today.”One for the Arsenal fans “How differently does Wenger’s legacy play if Keane doesn’t do his knee at Elland Road in 1997?” says Harvey Auzorst. “Without that half of the first double you’re looking at one FA Cup in his first five years, and the idea of Wenger changing everything seems a bit flimsy.”They might have won it anyway but it’s an interesting point. There are so many ifs in the rivalry: the Treble and the Invincible season wouldn’t have happened had Bergkamp and Van Nistelrooy scored last-minute penalties.There are a few minutes remaining at the London Stadium, where West Ham are playing the champions Manchester City. You won’t believe the score!At its furious peak, the UnitedArsenal rivalry brought out the Danny Dyer in almost all of us. I had to be held back at least twice. What are your favourite memories of that rivalry? It doesn’t have to be from that glorious period between 1996 and 2005. It could be before (Whiteside v Rocastle, Winterburn v McClair), or after (the late sting at Highbury in 2007, Cristiano Ronaldo scoring from a different postcode in 2009).Or it could just be 14 April 1999, the greatest game in English football history. Were you on the pitch? Were you the fan whose fag breath is one of David Beckham’s most vivid memories of that night? If you have any good tales or memories, email them in. I promise that, when I brazenly nick them for the book I’m writing on this very subject, I’ll give you a credit.The best fan story of all belongs to Barry Ferst. You might not know his name. But I bet you know his face.Arsene Wenger has picked a deluxe Carling Cup team, with eight changes from the side that drew with Atletico Madrid on Thursday night: David Ospina, Hector Bellerin and Granit Xhaka are the survivors.Since then, United v Arsenal has become a common-or-garden big game. Today could barely even be described as that, as there is nothing much riding on it. The two teams will almost certainly finish in their current positions of second and sixth, and Arsenal have a trip to Madrid on Thursday to consider. It’s a kind of testimonial for the glory years. And by heaven, what years they were.Kick off is at 4.30pm."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3008d73763e72e1c65cbf58bca18703a602f2485/0_138_3112_1868/master/3112.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5d1ee40a63f193a9a592449bb4a7ad5f","title":"west ham v manchester city premier league live","story":"Manchester City fended off a brief West Ham revival to win 4-1 at London Stadium and continue David Moyes’s relegation concerns• Manchester City women knocked out of Women’s Champions LeagueThanks for your time this afternoon! Now there are a couple more MBMs for you ...Man United v Arsenal with Rob Smyth:Fiorentina v Napoli with ... errr ... me:We might have expected a more exciting second half but West Ham, who didn’t have an attack worthy of the name in the latter 45, were invisible and City came out firing. They’ve won this very comfortably, only those five late first-half minutes inconveniencing them, and West Ham must continue to sweat for the points that would pretty much keep them up.90 min: It’s not all smiles at City today by a long way. They’ve just been knocked out of the Women’s Champions League:89 min: ... only for his effort to deflect off the ball and behind. The corner is then cleared.88 min: Sane is toppled just outside the box and City, who have been winding this down lightly, have a chance for five. The away fans want Toure to take it in fact they’ve been wanting Toure to shoot ever since he’s come on. And here comes Yaya ...86 min: London Stadium looks very empty indeed. It’s just not working out there at all, is it?84 min: Leicester away for the Hammers next – they’re really going to need a result now, aren’t they?81 min: Really, those five minutes at the end of the first half aside, West Ham have been poor given the stakes they are playing for – despite the class of the opposition.80 min: City have a corner but first we’ll see a league debut for 19-year-old England youth striker Lucas Nmecha, who replaces Jesus.77 min: Zabaleta somehow prevents Jesus from scoring close to the line after Fernandinho beats Adrian to the ball on the right.76 min: Not a lot going on out there save for keepball from City.74 min: More from Ian Sargeant – “Horse has bolted? Correct. Arnie is crying out for support and should have had some at the break. It’s getting tetchy in here. Do the possession stats include the time we take to get the ball back to the centre spot?”73 min: Jesus almost manages to hook a cute Fernandinho chip towards goal but there’s nobody around to help and Adrian claims.71 min: City replace Gundogan with Yaya Toure.70 min: I’ve no idea what happened down West Ham’s left for that 15-minute period around the last couple of goals, but it was an absolute shambles.68 min: West Ham have now conceded more goals than anyone else in the ision this season.66 min: Hernandez, Masuaku and Joao Mario replace Lanzini, Evra and Fernandez. The horse has bolted though.Sterling, for the zillionth time this half, finds acres of green grass and, with several men in support, lays it on a plate for Fernandinho to sweep home. This has been so, so easy for City since half time.62 min: Another chance! Sterling is released by Jesus after an awful Adrian kick but hesitates critically and lets the goalkeeper save. City should be well out of sight by now.61 min: Ogbonna concedes possession and Gundogan shoots wide. Walker now comes off, replaced by Danilo, but it’s West Ham who really need to do something here.59 min: Undeterred, Sterling gets in behind again, laying back to De Bruyne for a shot that goes wide and rattles the back stanchion – deceiving a few of the away fans, by the sounds of it. City are rampant at the moment.57 min: Sterling goes down under Cresswell’s challenge and that’s the clearest penalty ever ... but it’s not given, and in fact Neil Swarbrick points the other way! Cresswell’s trailing leg absolutely took Sterling out there.56 min: Surely time for Carroll, or Hernandez? Or even Hugill?They might not be in the game anymore. Jesus finds Sterling beautifully and then, while the winger scampers away down the right, makes his way into the box. He takes the return pass, makes a fool of Zabaleta with a lovely first touch, and finishes confidently from close range. City have upped things again and West Ham are, once more, in big trouble.51 min: It’s not quite been the rousing start to the second half West Ham might have sought – but the longer they stay in the game ...48 min: Just for one split second Arnautovic appears to beat Otamendi to a Zabaleta ball and work himself through on goal, but the defender does enough.46 min: City threaten within 18 seconds, Zabaleta in very sharply to stop Gundogan getting a clear shot on goal from Sterling’s cutback.Sammy Lopez Metta Bexar writes: “Down in San Antonio we wonder why Chicharito left Germany for another Premier League go when once again, he hardly plays. Yay Cresswell, but really, is it just Moyes never knows what to do with his little pea-shooter, er, scoring machine?”From nowhere, that’s got interesting! City scored twice, probably both own goals, before West Ham got going but a sudden flurry ended with Cresswell scoring a free-kick and, even though the champions ought to have scored a couple more, we have a football match!45+5 min: A clever scoop to Arnautovic is instead attempted, but I’d have gone with the blast.45+4 min: Otamendi takes out Lanzini again ... and could that be a second yellow? West Ham’s players think so, and so does Moyes, and I’ve seen those given to be honest. Instead it’s another free-kick, just about within shooting range if they fancy it ...45+2 min: Now Adrian beats away a Sterling drive. So important for West Ham not to concede again at this point.45+1 min: We’ll see four extra minutes of this half. They should perhaps start with a City goal but Sane, found in space by De Bruyne, is slack with his pass back to Gundogan when he could maybe have finished it himself. De Bruyne eventually regains possession and curls wide.43 min: City, who just lost their heads for a 90-second spell there, which began when Ederson got away with dithering in possession, try to respond and De Bruyne shoots straight at Adrian. It’s suddenly noisy in there now!Did someone mention meek defeat? Maybe not anymore! Cresswell makes light of the free-kick, whipping it over the wall and inside Ederson’s near post. The goalkeeper won’t be happy with that. But: game on!41 min: And that has set the tone for a mini-revival, Fernandes delivering from the right and Kouyate just unable to make proper contact. And then West Ham should have a penalty! It’s Gundogan clipping Fernandes, and replays show it’s half a yard inside the box – but a free-kick is awarded a yard outside it!39 min: It would have been quite nice if West Ham had broken with modern-day bottom-half tradition here and given it a go today, wouldn’t it? Instead meek defeat is nailed on. Arnautovic tries to change that after mugging Ederson on the ball, but is adjudged to have fouled the goalkeeper before rolling home. He may have been a bit unlucky.38 min: Otamandi chops Lanzini over in full flight and is deservedly booked. Can West Ham make something of the free-kick, a good 35 yards from goal? Ogbonna nods it back to Arnautovic, who slices over, but the centre-back was offside anyway.36 min: Fernandes tries to send Arnautovic away but there’s Ederson, stationed outside his own box, to head the ball calmly to the feet of his own defender Laporte.35 min: West Ham get away with more terrible defending, Jesus blocking a Rice backpass and seeing it run onto Sane, who never quite gets it under control and can’t beat Adrian as he tries to round him."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8029897b46bda0e1c8e7d500eca606634e2a39d0/0_0_4775_2865/master/4775.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2cc7fb7871eccd9fa28e313bd7ac158d","title":"barbara hulanicki biba the worst age milestone was 40","story":"The Biba founder and designer, 81, talks about ageing, cheese and young friendsI went to live in Miami for six months and ended up there for 28 years.

Why? ‘It just feels like the right thing to do’‘If you analyse what I’m saying,” says Jamie Oliver, “there’s nothing clever and there’s nothing really that controversial it’s fucking really basic common sense.”We meet on the morning that a letter he coordinated has been released, addressed to the prime minister and signed by Jeremy Corbyn, Nicola Sturgeon and other party leaders. It calls on the government to ban junk food advertising before 9pm and unhealthy buy-one-get-one-free offers, among other things. Oliver is proud of it. He looks relaxed, sitting on one of the sofas in his industrial, vintage-styled head office – although he knows the attacks will come. Later, he will be accused on Twitter of being the “fun police” a column in the Sun will call it a nanny-state initiative that penalises poor people.He talks in long, rambling sentences, bristling with energy. His transformation from cheeky-chappy Essex boy chef to single-issue crusader, facts and figures to hand, about to appear in front of a select committee, is complete. You would think he would have enough going on – he closed several of his restaurants recently and restructured his business – but Oliver remains laser-focused on the issue of childhood obesity.So far, Oliver seems to be coming at obesity principally as a diet problem, rather than a social one, although it may be too much to ask even someone as energetic and ambitious as him to fix society. Obesity disproportionately affects children in deprived areas. If there is one criticism of Oliver that seems to stand up, it is that he does not entirely understand what it is like to live in relentless, grinding poverty: to be unable to afford fresh vegetables (healthy food is three times more expensive, per calorie, than unhealthy food – Oliver has suggested that the government should subsidise healthy food) to be too tired to cook from scratch every night to take the financial risk on a lentil recipe that your kids may refuse to eat.At one point, when we are talking about whether people – working parents, people who have to work several jobs – can be persuaded to turn their backs on the ease of convenience food, he acknowledges that “humans crave convenience, that’s what we’re programmed to do. But convenience food doesn’t have to be shit. The freezer is the future.” But what if you live in a small flat, with a tiny fridge and just an ice box? “Of course, but you can buy it on the defrost – that will be two or three days in the fridge still. You don’t have to have it all racked up in the freezer. But costs are down, welfare is up, waste down. Convenience food doesn’t have to be shite.” But it probably will not be cheap.Maybe it does not help when he keeps talking about “them” and “us”, as if people on low incomes or benefits are a separate species. But he is not having it. “Yeah, because I don’t have to worry about feeding my kids today and they do. It’s not hard to get someone to say: ‘Jamie Oliver is a wanker.’ I think the concept of having an opinion and caring in Britain is a really funny one, you know: ‘How dare you.’” It is true that he is in an impossible position – as a chef reportedly worth £150m, he is regularly accused of hypocrisy (years on, those lucrative supermarket adverts are used as a stick with which to beat him) and for lecturing the rest of us, but the alternative would be to do nothing. “When I stand up there and start talking, you may or may not like what I say,” he says. “But if you’ve ever seen the people representing the advertising industry or the food industry, I know you would trust me with your kids more than them.”Why does he do it? There must be times when an easier life – with his wife, Jools, their five children and their lovely £9m home in Hampstead, north London, and his TV cookery shows – seem more appealing. “The important stuff I’ve done I’ve rarely enjoyed,” he says. “I get a beating quite regularly.” So, why carry on? “It just feels like the right thing to do,” he says slowly, enunciating every word.Oliver became political early on. It was only three years after his explosive 1999 debut as the Naked Chef that he was training unemployed young people to staff his restaurant Fifteen – filmed, of course, for a TV series (few can match Oliver’s media skills). His campaign to improve school dinners culminated in the series Jamie’s School Dinners in 2005, while his 2008 series Ministry of Food followed his initiative to teach cookery skills in Rotherham (that project closed last year after Rotherham council stopped funding it, but there are others around the country).In 2015, Oliver turned his attention to sugar with his documentary Jamie’s Sugar Rush. The month it aired, he says darkly, “stuff changed. Like burglaries, computer systems, break-ins at the office, home.” Before I can ask if he thinks Big Sugar was trying to intimidate him, he continues: “I don’t know, but there’s a string of events since the month that started.” Still, the sugar tax was introduced, under David Cameron’s government (Oliver has been scathing of Theresa May’s childhood obesity strategy).People have often tried to work out what drives Oliver, but I suspect it is as simple as the satisfaction of seeing results (just like the process of starting with raw ingredients and producing a Sunday roast). “As time has gone on and we’ve got some stuff done, you realise that getting stuff done isn’t that common,” he says. Someone called him a socialist recently and he had to look up the definition. He does not think he is one he prefers the idea of running a commercial business with a social ethos.That is not to say everyone agrees he is succeeding. A report in the Times last month portrayed his chief executive Paul Hunt, who is married to Oliver’s sister, as a bully, quoting a former employee who said “morale is at rock bottom”. “It’s complete bollocks,” Oliver says. “You can walk round the business. Like I said to the editor when they ran the story, come in and talk to everyone. If you’re talking about some bad leavers, of course you’re going to find some people who have something to whine about.”It has been a tough year for Oliver – tougher still for some of his staff. He describes the closure of one of his two Barbecoa steak restaurants and 12 of the 37 UK branches of his chain Jamie’s Italian as “awful. Worst time in my life.” It is the job losses, he says. “We’ve still got 2,000 people, but we’ve had to close 12 restaurants, which is about 800 people.”It can be easy to forget that, amid all the campaigning and the chain-restaurant managing, Oliver is still a wildly popular and successful chef. His most recent book, 5 Ingredients, was one of his biggest-selling and he has another out in the summer. He still writes two recipes every day (about a third are healthy, the rest less so this is often pointed out as though it is evidence of Oliver’s hypocrisy).Anyway, he has to go – Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall, that other anti-obesity campaigner and chef, is on the phone. Oliver says his business is committed to the target of halving childhood obesity by 2030. “That is what you’re going to hear me say for the next 12 years,” he says. You have to admire his single-mindedness. “Don’t get me wrong,” he adds, “I’m fucking looking forward to retiring.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a5c5ec742aa9096e7128e064e921465e2323459f/94_662_6096_3658/master/6096.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b527cd28d0c256cda9c51f7efecd4eb5","title":"nigel slater shortbread and pancake base recipes","story":"If you want a slice of crumbly tart, but don’t have time to make pastry, there are simple alternativesThere isn’t always time to make the pastry case for a tart to tenderly rub the cubes of butter into the flour with your fingers, to roll the dough into a smooth sheet then persuade it into the crinkles and corners of the tart tin. Neither is there the chance to cover the pastry with parchment and baking beans to keep it from shrinking as it bakes or to rescue runaway baking beans from the floor where a few inevitably end up as you lift them out. But sometimes, you just want a slice of tart.Of course, there are occasions when there simply has to be a pastry case. To hold a soothing balm of lemon curd for instance, or secure the raspberry jam and almond cream layers of a Bakewell pudding. (Blackcurrant jam is much better by the way.) You need deep, biscuit-crisp edges, too, for a treacle tart or a lemon meringue or for a nutmeg-freckled custard tart.Mostly, I need only a crisp and crumbly base on which to pile a layer of cream or cream cheese and another of seasonal fruit. Which is exactly what I did this week, folding flaked almonds, poppy seeds and pine nuts into a shortbread dough on which we placed ricotta cream and slices of Italian oranges, the fruit’s glowing flesh blushed with scarlet. As a glaze, I used a fragrant syrup of warm honey and thyme.I also put together a batch of pancakes this week.

Chop the hazelnuts in half, then mix with the pine kernels, poppy and sesame seeds, flaked almonds and pistachios. Finely grate the zest from the lemon then fold, together with the seeds and nuts, into the shortbread dough.Bring the mixture together with floured hands, put on a parchment-lined baking sheet, then lightly pat into a rectangle roughly 22 x 24 cm. Bake for 20-25 minutes until pale biscuit-coloured. Remove from the oven and leave to cool for 10 minutes, then slide carefully on to a cooling rack and leave until cold.Remove the peel from three of the oranges with a sharp knife then slice the fruit thinly and place in a small bowl. Put the cream in a mixing bowl and beat until thick, but not so firm it will stand in peaks. Fold in the ricotta and refrigerate.Put the juice of the orange, the honey and thyme leaves into a small pan and warm over a low heat until the honey has melted.

We have been together for 15 months and he is exactly what you would want in a partner – loving, kind, accepting and ultimately makes himself totally available to me in all senses of the word. This is also exactly the opposite of any kind of man I have dated previously and I worry that those experiences have somehow scarred me. I find myself wishing he was more unavailable, less overtly loving and did not dote on me so much.I feel I am attracted more to men I know to be bad news, particularly if they’re off limits, and I wish there was more passion in our relationship. None of this is helped by my having health problems recently. We have discussed moving in together and a big trip, but I find myself torn between this path and a very different partner and life.I can’t tell if I am pursuing the idea of perfection, or if these are genuine issues that will leave me feeling dissatisfied and unhappy later down the line.Mariella replies I’m so glad you wrote. It takes most of us so much longer to realise we’re making bad choices – three decades in the case of yours truly – so well done for spotting your romantic peccadillos so soon! Not that such self-awareness automatically gifts you with a crystal ball for future pairing. Taking that for granted would be tantamount to believing that we live in a fair and equal world and we all know that’s not the case. Any relationship is a gamble and while that can get us into all sorts of trouble along the way it’s also part of the fun.The pursuit of perfection may be a compelling pastime that occasionally achieves tangible results, but in most cases it proves an everlasting and insatiable quest. You may well be in a relationship that’s ill-suited to your emotional requirements or you may just be overthinking things. As this is your first serious coupling it’s unlikely to be your last, which may sound harsh but that certainly takes the heat off and offers you a lot more exploratory freedom than you might feel at, say, 40.You describe your previous preference for men who behave badly, but your choice of a “serious” boyfriend is the opposite of that description. Why so? Did self-preservation come into play or does the guy you’ve ended up with have more appealing qualities than you are giving him credit for? Nobody wants to while away their lives with a dullard, so I’m always cautious about those who are committed to “protecting”, “taking care of”, or worse still “worshipping” their lover.A desperation to nurture you is as unwelcome an aspiration as serial adultery. All the best relationships I’ve witnessed have been those where partners don’t lose a sense of their own priorities. Therefore, when you say he “ultimately makes himself available to me in all senses of the word,” I get nervous. The answer seems to be to sample the experience for as long as you enjoy it and stop worrying about whether he’s the perfect proposition for the long haul. I can see you are tying yourself in knots trying to make the right choice, but what if there’s no such thing?My advice would be to stop chewing over the long-term considerations and just accept this relationship in the here and now. Taking an extended trip seems an excellent way of establishing whether there is a possibility for anything longer term. If he doesn’t drive you crazy when you’re in constant close proximity, you’ll know that you stand a chance of cohabiting successfully. Nothing is laid in stone, life is an endless array of changes and choices and I suspect by conscientiously trying to do the best thing you’re limiting your experiences. Predicting the future is a fool’s game and yet it ties up so much of our emotional energy.When you get to my age and start attending more funerals than weddings it’s a topic you can’t help but dwell on. What was time well spent? What was squandered? All too often it’s the energy expended on fretting and speculating about what might happen rather than living each day as the welcome surprise it is that seems worth regretting. It also seems time we all embraced a more realistic and contemporary approach to our pairings. Once upon a time the choice of who to settle down with was a serious business, particularly for women. When you’d made your choice, or had it made for you more often than not, there you were, stuck, until death did you part. Nowadays we can hook up and pair off, change our minds, stream through a whole regiment or decide our best friend was the person we wanted all along. Freedom brings with it an escalation of personal choice and that doesn’t make decision-making easier.Being attracted to bad boys and hitching your wagon to one for life are very different things but you mustn’t live in fear of making mistakes. Worrying about the future is seriously detrimental to enjoying the present and I’m increasingly convinced that’s all we can be sure of. So enjoy the relationship for what it offers, or move on to more adrenaline-fuelled adventures – both routes have something to offer."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0e8078f09cec0af5318251aa74aa92cb1ffa4a28/0_154_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=748cc02f787fc0d78ef1bb53e94837b4","title":"journalism class private education","story":"It is often said that the British media industry is pale, male and stale but it’s probably fairer to call it pale, male and posh. The problem with this, apart from the lack of a satisfying rhyme, is that it can be hard to tell whether someone grew up poor and disadvantaged.In the absence of obvious signs, the British class system allows for an infinite ways of guessing – from someone’s accent to the understanding that Quentins and Camillas don’t tend to grow up on council estates, while Kevins and Sharons rarely learn to ski as a child.But these signs are subjective: Harry Evans, the working-class former Sunday Times editor, was nicknamed “poshie” at school because his train-driver dad owned a car. Evans is now a knighted 89-year-old, yet still we haven’t moved on.Privately educated pupils are also more likely to go to Oxbridge, which makes more offers to one school – Eton – than all of those on free school meals, according to research by David Lammy MP.The declining economic fortunes of the industry mean that cheap and even free labour, in the form of unpaid internships, are increasingly common, while expensive postgraduate degrees appear the best way in for many. Given this, the barriers to those who need to earn money to launch a career look set to get even worse.Some will argue that this lack of income ersity doesn’t matter: only the best rise to the top, as though ratlike cunning and a passion for deadlines are taught alongside manners at public schools.This is about an industry meant to hold a light up to the rest of society rather than feel part of a club. As Channel 4 presenter Jon Snow highlighted last year, the failure of the media to report safety concerns over Grenfell Tower ahead of time, suggest that being part of a comfortable elite does no one any favours.Which is not the same as saying that journalists only write about what they know – down that alley lie women writing only about “women’s issues” and reporters of colour writing about race – but, among other things, ersity allows for safety in numbers. It took me 25 years to go back and report on where I come from – a council house in London’s East End – because after a Cambridge education I liked being able to fit in.Grenfell Tower, Brexit, growing up as a racial minority: other journalists have talked about the time it takes to write about the things that touch where and how they grew up.My colleague Owen Jones got into a social media spat recently when he made similar points. The problem is, what to do about it. Some newspaper groups, along with the Broadcast Journalism Training Council and National Council for the Training of Journalists, are trying to help: they’ve launched various ersity schemes, some of which fund training courses.But such philanthropy is unlikely to be enough. The government-appointed Cairncross commission, looking into the state of journalism in the UK, should examine the impact of digital change on ersity and not just the industry’s finances.It really shouldn’t matter where, or how, somebody grew up – Jon Snow is just one example of a brilliant journalist who grew up in a privileged household. But the media industry needs to look outside the white male able-bodied elite to others who want to speak truth to power. Without that, it could so easily become an industry just speaking to itself.Too slow to set things rightEvery unhappy family is unhappy in its own way, said Tolstoy, long before the newspapers were able to report on court proceedings in the UK and print blurry pictures of young blonde girls being led away by foster carers wearing veils.One such picture, published on day one of four front pages in The Times about a “Christian” girl placed with Muslim carers last summer, caused an uproar. Details of the case, such as the child’s cross and favourite bacon-laden spaghetti carbonara being taken away, were pounced on by the far right.Trevor Phillips, the former equality tsar who really should know better, also wrote in the Sun that this was “akin to child abuse”, while the Mail gathered several MPs to call for an inquiry into such culturally inappropriate foster care.By the end of that week, the case judge was so worried about the impact of the media coverage that she allowed for the anonymised case details to be published. In it we read of the alcohol and cocaine tests needed for child AB’s mother, and of an absent father. We also read of the girl’s own mixed-race heritage. The woman she would eventually go to live with – her grandmother – was a non-practising Muslim who needed to have court documents translated into her native tongue, and expressed a desire to take the girl to live back in her home country, outside the UK. Yet this prompted a victory declaration in the Times that the “Judge rules child must leave Muslim foster home”.It was this which led, eight months later, to the Independent Press Standards Organisation declaring last week that The Times had got it wrong and ordering a correction somewhere in its first six pages. The Times itself decided to put the correction on its front page, recognising perhaps that “due prominence” would not apply anywhere else.Andrew Norfolk, who wrote the Times articles, has made a name for himself by going against the received wisdom held by the media bubble. Working from his home in Leeds, Norfolk’s carefully researched investigation into the grooming of vulnerable young girls in Rotherham won awards and gained him a reputation for telling the truth, no matter how awkward.Yet the truth in this case, while complicated and messy, was distorted and emphasised in a way to cause damage and harm.All journalists make mistakes, but did it really need to take the regulator all this time to work out details of a case made available on 30 August last year?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b0d04a3b979cddf26ea42ca225794e1ea4af0ad1/0_0_2992_1795/master/2992.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0c07ef003b7576201ee8e0ae739d7259","title":"akala review shepherds bush empire london black people hip hop poet","story":"Shepherd’s Bush Empire, LondonAs he unpicks the marginalisation of black people, the rapper and cultural commentator seems to draw ever more strength from his own messagesRapper, musician and cultural commentator Akala is becoming one of the UK’s foremost critical thinkers, having recently spoken on everything from Grenfell and Corbyn to the entire  of human history in his televised epic poem The Ruins of Empires. This all-encompassing scrutiny is clear from the get-go of his sold-out show, with an introductory video in which he criticises western television for its propagation of negative images of black people over the course of history. Backed by his DJ and a live drummer, Akala carries the air of a civil rights orator. His energetic presentation and lyrically dense raps float with poise, are ingested by his cult following and reflected back in the form of constant mobbing.Particular fervour is whipped up as he moves through call-to-arms thriller Sun Tzu, with the help of featured guest Asheber, and the crowd’s growing appreciation for his tongue-twisting prowess crafts a raucous atmosphere. Each of the night’s peaks, from singalong anthems Roll Wid Us and XXL to curtain call Find No Enemy, are constantly topped, and these leaps do not falter as the show continues. It’s as if he finds infinite strength in rejecting gang violence, examining historical injustice towards black people, and exploring the doctrines of black leaders such as Malcolm X and Marcus Garvey. His calm demeanour is a tonic to the lyrical onslaughts, and comforting, given the tough nature of his subject matter.Akala’s mission to educate becomes increasingly obvious, and comic-book style visuals and impromptu on-stage soliloquies inject vividness into his songs about finding one’s path after being led astray. There is a genuine feeling that he is trying to make sense of the world’s injustices as he speaks, which numbs the crowd into a thought-provoking silence. He saves the night’s most powerful sequence for Visions, a detailed account of black history, from pre-civilisation to the present day, that bounces off the exceptional pounding drums that soundtrack the entire evening. He draws a line in the sand between himself and his braggadocio rap contemporaries, with anecdotes relating to discovering his own limitations, and urges the crowd to do the same. His fervent hand-waving is proof that his belief in his own work continues to burn like an Olympic flame."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ae038e8c2c4b36908a25371c5654c626e38ed80/0_1953_5547_3327/master/5547.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=56060177d1dbd221307c3fcc7443ad43","title":"bob dylan whiskey heavens door","story":"For a man whose Bootleg Series now runs to 13 albums, distilling his own Tennessee liquor seems like a logical next stepBob Dylan will next month launch a range of whiskeys, hoping to capitalize on growing demand for all things celebrity-tagged.Heaven’s Door Spirits – a Tennessee straight bourbon, a double barrel whiskey and a straight rye – will initially be available in Tennessee – where the 76-year-old singer and Nobel laureate has joined with liquor entrepreneur Marc Bushala to turn a deconsecrated church into a distillery – Florida, California, Illinois, New York and Texas. A wider rollout will follow.Dylan’s new project was announced on Saturday. “You don’t always find inspiration,” he mused in a press release. “Sometimes it finds you. We wanted to create a collection of American whiskeys that would each tell a story.” Bushala, 52, told his story to the . The project began, he said, when he noticed Dylan, whose Bootleg Series now runs to 13 albums, had filed a trademark application for “bootleg whiskey”. Bushala contacted the enigmatic singer and made his pitch.Knowing that Dylan is a whiskey aficiando, Bushala decided to approach the project from a whiskey-centric point of view. “That appealed to Bob,” he said. “This is not a vanity project for him. It’s a passion project.”When it came to a name, the two men “wanted a standalone name for whiskey that could also be a nod and a wink to Dylan”.Dylan’s songs are not short of whiskey references, among them Copper Kettle (The Pale Moonlight) (“Daddy he made whiskey, my grandaddy he did too  We ain’t paid no whiskey tax since 1792”) Blind Willie McTell (“He’s dressed up like a squire  Bootlegged whiskey in his hand”) Gotta Serve Somebody )“Might like to drink whiskey  Might like to drink milk”) and Moonshiner (“I’ve spent all my money  On whiskey and beer”).The two men got down to 10 favourites, then agreed to go with a reference to Knockin’ on Heaven’s Door, a hit from the 1973 album Pat Garrett \u0026amp Billy the Kid which in fact does not refer to whiskey. “Everyone felt strongly that Heaven’s Door was just a perfect name,” Bushala said, “especially given the imagery we’re using on the bottles” – wrought ironwork from Dylan’s own metalwork foundry in Los Angeles.Someone as “eclectic and erse as Bob”, Bushala said, should put out “an evolving collection or portfolio” of whiskeys. To achieve that, he said, he raised $35m from investors.Dylan’s idea for his own whiskey came from a more down-to-earth source: his earliest incarnation as a Woody Guthrie-esque, riding-the-rails wandering minstrel.In a statement to the New York Times, the singer said: “I’ve been traveling for decades and I’ve been able to try some of the best spirits that the world of whiskey has to offer. This is great whiskey.”Bushala said: “There have been spirits and whiskey in his music for as long as he’s been making it, going on 60 years, and in the kind of rural Americana that plays into it. So for sure in his mind, there were elements he was after. But it wasn’t directly articulated.“He was after a mood or a feeling. He wasn’t after saying, ‘This should taste more smokey or have more corn or rye, or adjust the proof.’” Presented with one distillation, Bushala said, Dylan said simply the drink should feel “more like a wood structure”. “We were nodding like we understood,” Bushala said. “But we didn’t really.”Nor, perhaps to the horror of Dylan purists, is this the singer’s first foray into the world of commerce. The singer is a periodic pitchman, endorsing Chobani, Chrysler and even Victoria’s Secret.“He didn’t sell out,” Bushala insisted. “This is his brand, and it’s his idea. We just helped him do what he wanted to do. Bob does not want to be face man of the brand and he does not want the packaging to scream ‘Dylan’.”Dylan’s signature is therefore on the reverse side of the label, Bushala said, making it visible only when the bottle is empty. “He was willing to do that but he’s not going to appearances or bottle signings. He didn’t even pick up his Nobel prize so he’s not going to go out touting this. And that’s great because it’s authentic for Dylan and authentic for the brand.” With some irony, perhaps, the rules that will govern the success or otherwise of Dylan’s project will, like his whiskey and his music, hark back to America’s past. Liquor distribution in the US is still based on a post-prohibition model, each market tightly controlled by licensed state distributors. Those markets have to be broken into much as folk musicians or promoters once toured local radio stations, seeking precious airplay.“There are parallels,” Bushala said. “You’re going from account to accounts and hand-selling. You’re going round, knocking on the doors.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/78fd60c8e2424c4c5ce5fa1bbdb727f82cff2785/176_111_935_561/master/935.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=11ce2733249da7789f2bf8a269c76a79","title":"eugene onegin review theatre royal glasgow tchaikovsky","story":"Theatre Royal, GlasgowNatalya Romaniw is a glorious Tatyana in Scottish Opera’s new show, wonderfully conducted by Stuart Stratford and incorporating extra parts of Pushkin’s novelEugene Onegin is the exception to the rule that great operas have lives of their own, independent of their literary sources. It is a masterpiece, but impossible to detach from Alexander Pushkin’s verse novel on which it is based. Tchaikovsky knew that, carefully categorising it as “lyric scenes”, intended for an audience in 19th-century Russia that probably could have recited large chunks of Pushkin’s work from memory. He could be sure that the crucial strands of the story of Onegin and Tatyana he omitted from his libretto would have been well known to his first audiences.It’s one of the achievements of Oliver Mears’s fine new production for Scottish Opera that, as well as remaining almost entirely faithful to the opera’s text, it explores some of those extra strands, especially the pervading importance of memory, a fierce sense of loss, and opportunities for happiness squandered. Mears and designer Annemarie Woods shift the story to the early 1900s, the last years of Tsarist Russia, but conjure that period through the memory of the old Tatyana (played by actor Rosy Sanders). She’s dowdy and grey-haired. The grandeur and affluence of her marriage to Gremin have been destroyed by the 1917 revolution, and as she returns to her dilapidated family home she painfully relives the events of her youth there.Within that frame, the action is truthful, although rather than keep Tatyana’s letter, as in the Pushkin, this Onegin (Samuel Dale Johnson) returns it to her, so that the very last image of the production is of the older Tatyana tearing it into tiny pieces. It’s by no means a lavish production – the basic box set is a constant, and the chorus and most of the dancers (with the exception of solo ballerina, Eve Mutso, dancing Ashley Page’s choreography) remain behind gauze in the two ball scenes. There is, however, a horse, on which Onegin makes his first appearance, and which on the first night deposited a steaming pile of dung centre stage.Johnson is a credible Onegin, handsome and haughty in the first act a broken man by the time he confronts Natalya Romaniw’s Tatyana in the final scene, even though his singing grew in expressive assurance as the opera went on. Romaniw’s performance is gloriously sung from the start, although she is perhaps more convincing as a princess than as a naive young girl. Peter Auty is a touching Lensky, whose ardent honesty is an obvious mismatch with Sioned Gwen Davies’s wild Olga, seen in flagrante with a farm worker in the first act.Graeme Broadbent makes a rather gravelly Gremin: the slow tempo for his aria didn’t help. Otherwise, the score is conducted with total conviction by Stuart Stratford. The Russian repertory is one of his specialisms, and it shows in the wonderfully rich textures he draws from the Scottish Opera orchestra, and by his habitually faultless dramatic pacing. A couple of passages will tighten as the production beds in: the climax of the Larins’ party, when the fatal duel is fixed, could have been fiercer, and the final scene could push more emotional buttons – but Scottish Opera should already be immensely proud of this show."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/16603970b80c30b2f4e96436f601df35b101f08c/2387_172_6068_3641/master/6068.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7a8dd5196f3548653a2ebb24424de662","title":"gary barlow review blackpool opera house take that","story":"Blackpool Opera HouseThere’s an almost music-hall atmosphere as this gig from the singer’s smaller-stage tour delivers a crowd-pleasing portfolio of Take That hits among solo numbers Where Take That’s stadium and arena tours have become visual extravaganzas, featuring mechanical elephants and giant robots, the band’s singer-songwriter’s theatre tour takes him back, if not for good, to intimate gigs heavy on traditional stagecraft and audience interaction. “Gary! Gary!” the mostly female audience (some wearing Barlow masks) chant before he bounds on, all peroxide quiff, big grins and black and red suit, which renders him a cross between a totalitarian dictator and Star Trek’s Captain Kirk. “Turn the lights up and let’s ’ave a look at this audience,” he yells. “Oh yes! Saturday in Blackpool!” Although Barlow’s reissued 1997 debut, Open Road, recently went Top 10, solo songs don’t feature prominently in the setlist. In the show opener Since I Last Saw You, however, he reconciles himself to being popular but uncool (“I’ve made my peace with what may happen  Accepted I won’t be in fashion”). This means he can cheerily interrupt songs with Alan Partidge-isms (“Whoo! Nice!” “Did you enjoy that? Yes!”) and trigger a massive singsong with a ticker-tape explosion as early as the second number. It’s a bit of a stretch to call Barlow a renaissance man, but the singerretired X Factor judge and occasional Heartbeat actor has built up a more varied portfolio than most performers who served their apprenticeship in northern working men’s clubs. Here, he delves into songs from his musicals, Finding Neverland and Calendar Girls, unveils a curious sideline as tour statistician (“and this song was released on the 11th October 1993”), tactfully avoids his brief but controversial 2014 period as a poster boy for tax avoidance and settles into a comfier role as all-round end-of-the-pier light entertainer. When someone in the crowd holds up a sign reading: “Mummy and me came from Malta. Can I have a hug?” he strides into the stalls to give them one. Someone else with a placard reading: “I’ll never forget sitting on your organ,” is theatrically scolded: “That’s disgusting!” He serenades an audience member called Martina with A Million Love Songs while she sits at the end of his piano and films it on her phone. There’s a dollop of pantomime as he removes his jacket: people start cheering “Stop it!” and bombard him with mock boos when he puts more clothing on. Otherwise, he knows that people want plenty of Take That nostalgia and doesn’t let them down. New song Relive Those Years tells the band’s story from early days to 2005 reformation with jazz, confessionals and witty self-deprecation. “My appetite for singing slowly dies,” he sings of his post-split wilderness period, rubbing his now trimmer stomach for the punchline, “replaced by an appetite for pies”. Meanwhile, TT smashes are gleefully reinvented – as big-band brass (Everything Changes), cod jazz funk (Sure), seaside disco stomper (Dan Hartman cover Relight My Fire) – or accompanied by comically bad dancing (Pray). Although he turns in a shift as sincere balladeer, this show is less about gravitas than 90 minutes of old-fashioned, almost music-hall showbiz. Still, it’s hard not to be swept along as a crowd choir turn Back for Good, Patience, Never Forget and the rest into Last-Night-of-the-Proms-type epics. Barlow reminds the audience that party towns and theatres like this are where he started and, in a sense, he has never left. “Goodnight,” he promises. “I’ll see you on the ghost train.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6f6ee8733d6ba3ce9d2e95accf98c9eaba3e453a/0_0_3500_2299/master/3500.jpg?w=1200\u0026h=630\u0026q=55\u0026auto=format\u0026usm=12\u0026fit=crop\u0026crop=faces%2Centropy\u0026bm=normal\u0026ba=bottom%2Cleft\u0026blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxOC8wMS8zMS9mYWNlYm9va19kZWZhdWx0LnBuZw\u0026s=624d0e28adb42854ad45fd10e97350f9","title":"amber rudd letter to pm reveals ambitious but deliverable removals target","story":"Exclusive: Home secretary’s denial last week she was aware of deportation targets at odds with January 2017 letter to MayThe private letter from Amber Rudd to Downing Street in which she sets an “ambitious but deliverable” target for an increase in the enforced deportation of immigrants has been published by the .Rudd has claimed she did not set, see or approve any targets for removals. The former immigration minister Brandon Lewis suggested on Sunday this proposed increase was an ambition rather than a target.But Home Office sources have told the  that it is “shame-faced nonsense” to claim the department had not been set specific targets in this area, or that these have not been regularly discussed at the highest levels.The latest furore was sparked on Friday when the  published details from a separate confidential memo that was sent to Rudd in June last year.Prepared by Hugh Ind, the director general of Immigration Enforcement in the Home Office, it picked up on the new policy outlined by Rudd in her letter to Theresa May.While Rudd has denied seeing the six-page briefing note, the  can now reveal that it was also sent to at least eight of the Home Office’s most senior officials, including:• Marc Owen, senior director of national and international operations in Immigration Enforcement.• Mark Thomson, the director general of the Passport Office.• Tony Eastaugh, UK director of operations at Immigration Enforcement.• Gareth Hills, director of performance and risk at the Home Office.• Stephen Kershaw, a senior director in Immigration Enforcement.• Andrew Wren, director of performance, assurance and governance at the Home Office.• Andrew Whitten, assistant director at the Home Office.The home secretary has issued five apologies in the last week – four of them over her department\u0027s handling of the Windrush crisis and immigration targets.Rudd delivered an unprecedented apology to parliament and acknowledged that her department had “lost sight of iniduals” and become “too concerned with policy”.Rudd apologised for failing to grasp the scale of the problem. She told the home affairs select committee: “I bitterly, deeply regret that I didn’t see it as more than inidual cases gone wrong that needed addressing. I didn’t see it as a systemic issue until very recently.”On Thursday morning, Rudd was forced to admit officials did have targets for removals, having previously denied their existence.“The immigration arm of the Home Office has been using local targets for internal performance management. These were not published targets against which performance was assessed, but if they were used inappropriately then I am clear that this will have to change.On Thursday afternoon, Rudd was forced to issue a hasty clarification after appearing to leave the door open to the UK staying in a customs union with the EU.“I should have been clearer – of course when we leave the EU we will be leaving the customs union.In a series of late-night tweets, Rudd apologised for not being aware of documents, leaked to the , which set out immigration removal targets.\u0026nbsp‘I wasn’t aware of specific removal targets. I accept I should have been and I’m sorry that I wasn’t. I didn’t see the leaked document, although it was copied to my office as many documents are.The disclosure will heap further pressure on Rudd, who has said she will address MPs on Monday to answer the “legitimate questions” that have been raised over the past week.On Friday night, nine hours after the  first told the Home Office about the leaked memo, Rudd tweeted: “I wasn’t aware of removal targets. I accept I should have been and I am sorry that I wasn’t.”The response appears at odds with the letter she sent to the prime minister in January last year.But it also suggests that none of the other senior officials and special advisers copied into the subsequent briefing note ever discussed with her the targets which the Immigration Enforcement agency was attempting to reach on her instruction.Home Office sources have told the  that Immigration Enforcement has been working all year to reach the target of 12,800 enforced returns in 2017-18.They have been bracing themselves to acknowledge to ministers that the agency has failed to do so. To meet the goal, it needed to deport 250 people a week, but it has only been able to remove about 225 a week.“At the Home Office we work in a target culture,” said a source. “The civil service is completely target based. That’s all we do. It is shame-faced nonsense for Amber Rudd to say otherwise.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/178984a25ada8e2cd4243639899dbd13a8bc5f70/248_280_1186_711/master/1186.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=613763ed07d1e67a7de2f83f7a433257","title":"davis under pressure to disown criticism of civil service chief on brexit","story":"Minister reported to have told PM he would resign if she did not sideline Whitehall mandarinDavid Davis is facing demands from the senior civil servants’ union to disown claims that he has threatened to resign unless Theresa May sidelines Whitehall’s most senior Brexit mandarin.It follows reports in the Sunday Times claiming that the Brexit secretary had told the prime minister he would step down unless the No 10 adviser Oliver Robbins was ignored in favour of ministers.May faces a tense Brexit inner cabinet meeting on Wednesday, when she is expected to put forward a plan, backed by Robbins, to create a customs partnership with the EU. EU members (plus Turkey, Andorra, Monaco and San Marino) trade without customs duties, taxes or tariffs between themselves, and charge the same tariffs on imports from outside the EU. Customs union members cannot negotiate their own trade deals outside the EU, which is why leaving it – while hopefully negotiating a bespoke arrangement – has been one of the government’s Brexit goals.\u0026nbspSee our full Brexit phrasebook.Attacks upon Robbins in the media have provoked a furious response from civil servants. Dave Penman, the head of the FDA union, said: “Is there a more despicable form of political cowardice than to allow anonymous briefings in your name to effectively call for a civil servant to be sacked?“Civil servants advise, ministers decide. Politicians of all stripes know this. If David Davis leaves these comments from a ‘close ally’ out there unchallenged, it ultimately suggests that he supports them but isn’t brave enough to say so publicly”.Sir Jeremy Heywood, the cabinet secretary, also took the unusual step of tweeting about criticisms of Robbins. After May’s close aide Gavin Barwell retweeted a statement from the chief whip, Julian Smith, saying “Attacking ind civil servants is deeply unfair”, Heywood wrote:Under Robbins’ plan, the UK would collect import tariffs on behalf of Brussels, while being free to set its own duties for goods bound for the UK. Pro-Brexit Conservatives have described the plan as unworkable and say it will allow Brussels to dictate UK trade policy.According to the Sunday Times, Davis has told the prime minister to ignore Robbins in favour of her ministers.  Robbins, tipped as a future cabinet secretary, was moved from Davis’s Brexit department into No 10 last year as May sought to take greater control over the process.A former minister told the Sunday Times that Tory backbenchers could be willing to oust May if she does not stop listening to her adviser on the customs partnership plan.“The prime minister would be extraordinarily unwise to take Robbins’ advice on this,” they told the paper. “There will be a very swift and very violent reaction. It will put the prime minister in personal peril.”The Brexiter business group Leave Means Leave has called for Robbins to be sacked and “replaced by someone from outside the civil service who will take a tough line with Brussels”.Richard Tice and John Longworth of the Brexit-backing business group wrote: “At each stage, Robbins has presided over a bungled negotiating position on behalf of the UK, giving leverage to the EU and acquiescing to their every whim in a way no business person would do.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8fc75899cbe64170d23a20947d81aecc3f955ccd/17_42_2521_1512/master/2521.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e330361f2033d6a28e48db8a0ce5249f","title":"lewis hamilton wins azerbaijan grand prix red bulls collide","story":"Lewis Hamilton won the Azerbaijan Grand Prix for Mercedes, after a dramatic finale cost his team-mate, Valtteri Bottas, a likely win. A late safety car prompted by a shunt between the two Red Bulls proved decisive and ultimately hugely to the British driver’s benefit. His championship rival Sebastian Vettel finished only fourth in a race he had largely controlled. His Ferrari team-mate Kimi Raikkonen was second, with Force India’s Sergio Pérez in third.The win for Hamilton, wholly unexpected as he did not have the pace of the Ferrari all weekend, has moved him in front of Vettel in the world championship for the first time this season, with a four-point advantage. It was at the expense of Bottas however, who was leading with three laps to go when he suffered a puncture that took him out of the race.Vettel had looked in control for a comfortable win having led from pole and with a clear edge on Hamilton, who started from second. The British driver was struggling for grip however, and pitted early and was matched seven laps later by Vettel. Bottas stayed out, inheriting the lead and able to run well on his rubber until lap 40 when the Red Bulls of Daniel Ricciardo and Max Verstappen hit one another. Just as at the last round in China, stopping under the safety car proved key and Bottas was able to stay in front.The restart on lap 48 proved crucial, Bottas held his position but Vettel in second was far too hot into turn one, went wide and flat-spotted his tyre. It allowed Hamilton through and Vettel then lost further places to Raikkonen and Pérez. The race looked to belong to Bottas but a lap later the Finn picked up some debris and took a major puncture that removed him from contention. Mercedes and Hamilton had their first win but far from how they were expecting it.The win is Hamilton’s first of the season and more than he would have anticipated after struggling for grip in both practice and qualifying. His 63rd career victory is his first in Azerbaijan and completes the British driver’s achievement of having now taken a podium at every circuit on the 2018 calendar.The victory will be hugely pleasing and of some relief to the British driver and his team. Mercedes now have their first victory of the season but highlighted in Baku, especially for Hamilton, was the issue that they are still not getting to grips with putting their tyres in the correct operating window that has seen them struggling for performance thus far. They did however call the strategy for Bottas superbly to put him in contention and then make the most of it when the safety car was deployed.Hamilton won nine races on his way to his fourth world championship last season but having clinched it with ninth place in Mexico this is the first race he has won since then. He and Mercedes however know a stern test awaits. The opening four rounds suggest that Ferrari have a solid platform across tracks and conditions where Hamilton’s ride is proving more difficult to manage.Wrestling a victory here given the strength of the opposition at the Baku circuit will feel like a major achievement and as the teams return to western Europe will have given much-needed impetus to his title challenge.For Red Bull it was an afternoon that will require a stern debrief with their drivers. The two came together on the main straight in lap 40, with Ricciardo going into the back of Verstappen, causing the safety car to be deployed. They had been racing hard all race and had previously touched twice. Verstappen appeared to have moved twice in his attempt to defend and the incident was under investigation by the stewards. Verstappen has been under scrutiny for poor moves in recent races and the team will be furious with this result.Carlos Sainz in the Renault finished in fifth, while rookie Charles Leclerc completed an exemplary afternoon and his best drive thus far in F1 to take sixth for Sauber. The two McLarens of Fernando Alonso and Stoffel Vandoorne were in seventh and ninth, with Lance Stroll in the Williams in eighth and the Toro Rosso of Brendon Hartley in tenth."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8330426a5c10e3f78c1a09daf8a6a5dd456c3e05/375_146_1998_1198/master/1998.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ec87c6fc0184c846fc8c48e29119b472","title":"london irish saracens premiership match report","story":"Billy Vunipola handed England a big boost with his first match in three months as Saracens sealed second place in the Premiership with a 51-14 victory at already-relegated London Irish.Fit-again Vunipola came off the bench in Saracens’ seven-try victory in Reading, tasting his first action since breaking his arm in a 15-15 Champions Cup draw at Ospreys on 13 January.The 25-year-old has not played Test rugby since March 2017, with knee and shoulder problems contributing to a wretched 18-month injury run.But now Vunipola can chase full match sharpness before both Saracens’ play-off campaign - and England’s three-Test June tour to South Africa.Saracens hardly needed to drive beyond second gear to cruise past Irish, whose second Premiership relegation in three years had been confirmed on Saturday with Worcester’s 44-13 win over Harlequins.Brad Barritt, Duncan Taylor, Michael Rhodes, Marcelo Bosch, Richard Barrington, Alex Goode and Schalk Brits all crossed in Sarries’ bonus-point victory, which secured the north Londoners a home Premiership semi-final, while Owen Farrell kicked five conversions and added two penalties.The visitors comfortably shrugged off a yellow card for Maro Itoje, even though tries from Joe Cokanasiga and Johnny Williams had Irish trailing by just two points at half-time.An outclassed Irish will now kick-start the rebuilding process in a bid to make another immediate return to the top table, with new coaches Declan Kidney and Les Kiss expected to remain on board in the Championship next term.Irish lock Josh McNally’s yellow card sparked Saracens’ early try glut, the visitors crossing through Barritt and then Taylor.Farrell missed a snatch drop-goal conversion from Barritt’s score, to avoid any chance of a Television Match Official review.First Taylor’s wide pass to Liam Williams looked possibly forward, then the latter fumbled a pass that could have fell forward too. The score stood though, and Sarries quickly doubled their try tally thanks to Farrell’s lovely step and wide pass, with Taylor coasting over.Just when Sarries should have cut loose though, Irish hit back. Cokanasiga raced in at the right corner after Mako Vunipola’s loose pass, before team-mate Johnny Williams crossed on the stroke of half-time.Itoje was harshly sin-binned for a deliberate knock-on, and Irish seized full gain when Johnny Williams wriggled home, and Greig Tonks converted.Saracens led just 16-14 at the break then, but negotiated the remainder of Itoje’s sin-binning without leaking further score.And no sooner had the England and Lions lock returned than Saracens claimed their third try, Rhodes rising last from a penalty lineout maul.Bosch then powered home the bonus-point score just ahead of the hour, with the visitors by then in full control.Blair Cowan’s yellow card handed Barrington the chance to power home at the lineout tail, with Goode and Brits further massaging the scoreline at the death."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c3ebd3dd85a355c10540fd95586b02dd6122b56e/92_142_3982_2389/master/3982.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5c15d07187fb33f04fd94b859b620160","title":"azerbaijan grand prix f1 formula one live","story":"Lewis Hamilton won the Azerbaijan Grand Prix, thanks to a crash between the Red Bulls that inconvenienced Sebastian Vettel, and a puncture before the line that ruined Valtteri Bottas Otherwise that’s us - enjoy what’s left of the weekend! And here’s your report on an absolute jazzer of a race. Red Bull’s philosophy is not to stop team-mates fighting and the drivers seem ok with it, so I imagine that’ll be the end of things. Until next time. Verstappen said originally it was hard racing, but what happened afterwards was “not good”. He says they have to make sure it doesn’t happen again - he and Ricciardo are fine, and when you race “you go for every inch”. More from Hamilton: “It was an emotional race. Valtteri did an exceptional job and deserved the win. It feels odd to be up here but I have got to take it. It was an untidy race for me.”Bottas is unhappy, and hiding behind dark glasses. How do you handle the disappointment, he’s asked. “Ten pints of beer.”Nikki Lauda reckons they should’ve cleaned up the track properly, and Bottas should now be celebrating. Gosh, what a race that was. Can they come here every week? The trophies are presented. Hamilton shakes up his booze as does Perez, while Raikkonen has a swig of his. We hear the UK and German anthems. It’s very moving. Odds and sods: Charles Leclerc of Monaco and Sauber has scored his first ever points. Well in, my man. Hamilton hasn’t done much celebrating, which is fair enough. His team-mate had a mare, so it’s not being rubbed in, but points are points Raikkonen hugs his wife and is happy. He struggled a bit to keep his tyres warm enough, but here he is. Hamilton says it feels “a little bit harsh” to have won, but he kept pushing and he’ll take it. Lewis Hamilton is well pleased with himself. Yes, I know, but more even than usual. So, our results:“Well done Lewis. Lady luck was on our side today, but my heart goes out to Valtteri.”This does not tell us the whole story. Lap 5151: Hamilton is going to score points for the 29th consecutive race. Not bad. Lap 5151: No he doesn’t I was misinformed. Perez is good for another podium, which will make him the most decorated Mexican driver ever. Lap 5051: Perez has a five-second penalty, so will end up behind Stroll. Lap 4951: Hamilton hasn’t won a race since Austin last term, but here he is, and he’ll be double-chuffed to learn that Perez has gone by Vettel! He is now fourth! Lap 4951: Dearie me! Hamilton is going to win having barely been in the race! Poor old Valtteri! Lap 4951: Bottas runs over debris and has a puncture! Ouch! Lap 4851: What a mess this has been for Ferrari. Going in when the safety car came out instead of staying in front, then opting to attack instead of defend. Lap 4851: Hamilton is gaining on Bottas, Vettel fights back, his wheels locks, and Hamilton and Raikkonen pass him! Trying to win has cost him two places! Lap 4751: The safety car is on the way out..Lap 4751: It looks like we’re getting our dash to the line. Bottas could do with another quick prang behind him. Lap 4651: We might just get a restart. In the meantime:Lap 4551: Grossjean’s car is about to be wynched off the track. Grossjean himself stalks into the garage and theatrically chucks his gloves, but not at himself. Lap 4451: There’s all sorts of mess on the track. I’m not sure what kind of race we’ve got left here. Lap 4451: Apparently Christian Horner was “shaking with rage”. I’d love to know what that feels like. Lap 4351: Roman Grossjean, who was going well in fifth, has crashed behind the safety car while weaving to keep the tyres warm! That keep it out for longer, which might be enough for Bottas! Lap 4351: Is the plural of Red Bull Reds Bull?Lap 4351: Christian Horner is refusing to comment until he’s spoken to the drivers. I’m not certain he’s entirely happy with them. Lap 4251: That Red Bull crash doesn’t get less comical. The pair of cars, in the pits together, you’ve got to laugh. Lap 4151: Mercedes have played this really well. By keeping Bottas out there as long as possible they allowed for the possibility of a safety car, and they got one. Will Vettel go for the win, or keep second on the basis that Bottas isn’t going to challenge for the driver’s championship?Lap 4151: So what we’ve got now is Bottas in front - Ferrari put fresh tyres on - Vettel, then Hamilton. The charge when the safety car goes, and to the line, is going to be something. Lap 4051: Ricciardo wanted to go by on the left, Verstappen said no, Ricciardo was dummying him and went the other way, then shunted him in the jacksie. Their boss will probably want a quiet one. Lap 4051: Here comes the safety car, and Bottas pits. Lap 4051: The longer Bottas stays out ... excuse me while I interrupt myself! Ricciardo smashes into the front of Verstappen! Both are done! there is going to be trouble! Lap 3851: Bottas stays out for one more lap. He’ll come out ahead of Hamilton, but will he be able to challenge Vettel. Lap 3851: Ricciardo goes on and comes out with ultras, getting out in front of Raikkonen. He can now spend the rest of hi afternoon ruckusing with Versatappen.Lap 3751 If Bottas goes on ultrasofts, Hamilton will presumably have to let him by to try and challenge Vettel, then be allowed back in front if - when - no impression is made. Lap 3651: Bottas is still out there. Lap 3551: Ricciardo sets about Verstappen! He goes by after chilling in the slipstream and locking up, but times it well enough to maintain the advantage. Lap 3451: Bottas probably has enough to get in and out ahead of Hamilton, who trails him by roundabout 19 seconds. Vettel is 11.755 off the front. Lap 3351: Bottas is lapping faster than Hamilton at the moment, while behind the, Red Bull are staying out to get clear of Raikkonen. Lap 3252: The question for Bottas, or for Mercedes, is whether to stay out longer and try and get to the end on a supersoft. Do they want their drivers racing each other? Lap 3151: In to the pits goes Vettel, copying Hamilton’s soft tyes. He comes out behind Bottas, who still needs to pit. Lap 3051: We’ve hardly seen Vettel still, so absolute is and has been his domination. Bottas has just set the fastest lap, and is miles ahead of Hamilton. Lap 2851: Hamilton reckons his tyres aren’t great, but is told they should get him to the end. In the meantime, Ricciardo, hot on Verstappen’s tail, sets the fastest lap. He’s still fifth, mind.

But talk matters, as is demonstrated in Sarah Daniels’ 1983 play Masterpieces, which was derided by many male critics on its premiere, and now gets a timely revival.In an early scene, set at a dinner party, the men delight in telling sexist jokes about rape in front of the women. But Daniels’ ground-breaking play makes the link between misogynistic jokes and misogynistic actions. Set in pre-internet times when porn came between pages, it also suggests that porn that depicts sexual violence against women leads to real violence against women and harassment.This consciousness-raising story may lack the complexities of 21st-century gender politics, but doesn’t lack impact. Rowena (Olivia Darnley giving the production’s only memorable performance) is a social worker who thinks herself happily married and little of the fact that when her job keeps her out late at night she feels afraid of being alone on the streets.When a client is abused and she starts to investigate the pornography that her husband and his friends think is normal, she becomes angry and takes action. “How they must hate us,” she says on seeing one image.Daniels’s play, rightly kept in period by director Melissa Dunne, sometimes shows its age. But it also reminds us, in the era of #MeToo, that perhaps progress in the way men talk, think about and treat women has been less dramatic than we might think. The men in Masterpieces wear their misogyny like a badge of pride: today, it is more likely to be covert.The play is a fascinating example of radical non-linear storytelling, and it’s only a pity that it doesn’t get a sharper, stronger production than Dunne manages here. A small cast playing multiple roles makes demands that are clumsily handled and a lack of pace, fluidity and clarity do Daniels’ provoking drama no favours.

To a packed house, and under the watchful eye of the outgoing Apple Music executive (and Patti Smith producer) Jimmy Iovine, Smith’s performance – joined by Bruce Springsteen for two numbers – appeared as a foretelling of Apple’s remedial strategy and future direction.The world’s most valuable public company releases its latest results on Tuesday and has no doubt, once again, sold billions of dollars worth of iPhones. But as the iPhone ages, it’s increasingly clear that Apple is looking for new sources of revenue, and Smith is part of that effort.Big tech is moving into content production and distribution. For three years, the company has been hiring from the design and luxury industries – including top executives like Paul Deneve, the former CEO of Yves Saint Laurent, and Angela Ahrendts, the former CEO of Burberry.It hired or consulted with Iovine, Dr Dre and Nine Inch Nails’ Trent Reznor after Apple acquired Beats By Dre in a $1bn acquisition and briefly repurposed them for the launch of Apple Music, which has now gained 36 million subscribers and is poised to overtake its music streaming rival Spotify in the US.Rumors have even circulated that Apple is looking to buy parts or all of the troubled magazine publisher Condé Nast, a move that would further its push, initiated with the Apple Watch, to become a luxury fashion accessory, lifestyle and content brand.Can Apple buy its way out of trouble? On the surface that seems a ridiculous question for a company that made $61bn last year and is expected to have sold 54m iPhones in the last three months. But no matter its size, Apple still faces a big test on Tuesday. As the tech giant releases its first-quarter numbers, analysts worry they could expose further weakness in consumer demand for the company’s top-line products. Based on reports from Apple’s Asian supply chain partners, the company could be about to lower production targets for its iPhone X, the $1,000 model that has failed to meet sales expectations. In mid-March, Apple stock peaked at $182 its stock price fell to about $162 last week, dropping over five straight Wall Street trading sessions.“The street has gone into ‘full panic mode’,” the GBH Insights analyst Daniel Ives said in a client report. Ives said that bad news from Asian suppliers correlated with “softer demand and $1,000 sticker-shock price points on iPhone X”. The big question, he added, was what demand for Apple’s iPhone range would look like after the company launched its 12th-generation model in September. Patti Smith is a small part of Apple’s plan B. Gene Munster, a longtime Apple watcher and Loup Ventures analyst, estimates the company will ramp up its spending on original content in video, music and publishing to $4.2bn by 2022 from $1bn this year and $500m in 2017.“Historically, Apple has been a platform for distributing content but increasingly they want to create their own content and that changes their whole profile,” said Munster. Apple, he reasons, is in a similar position to Amazon in that it doesn’t want to make a ton of money from content but views it as a means to growth.“We think that content is always king and the tech companies are starting to understand how king content can drive their businesses. In Apple’s case that’s selling iPhones, in Google’s case it’s advertising, and in Amazon’s that’s selling Amazon Prime memberships.”The Condé Nast rumors may stem from Apple’s acquisition last month of Texture, a digital magazine subscription service part-owned by Condé Nast. Senior Apple executives said they were “committed to quality journalism”.Analysts think an acquisition unlikely. “It’s a well-traveled road of rumors of Apple buying content companies, typically a studio,” said Munster. Sadly for Condé, and others, people are less interested in paying for written content than video and music, he said. “It’s within the scheme of them paying for more content, but I think Apple has their sights set on video and music more than the written word.”Apple’s increased spending on content still leaves it short of the subscription darling Netflix ($6.8bn), or the surging Amazon, which is expected to increase its spending on original content from $4.5bn to $8.3bn.“Over the next five years, we think there’s going to be one single offering for video, music and print content. These essentially vertical subscriptions are focused on one type of content – music, video (Netflix or HBO) or print. So the concept is to create all-in-one offerings for different types of media,” said Munster.Apple’s acquisition of Condé Nast, whose US operation is believed to be losing $100m a year while its foreign operation is marginally profitable on similar revenues of around $1bn, would doubtless be a headline-grabbing move.But while media is a growing business for Apple, and it is reported to want to acquire and produce as many as 10 television shows, it has yet to register an original video content hit. Apple’s Planet of the Apps, a reality show about app developers, and Carpool Karaoke, a spin-off of James Corden’s hit late night segment that features celebrities singing in a car together, have not gained traction with audiences. Apple also purchased the rights for a TV project from Damien Chazelle, the Oscar-winning writer and director of La La Land, and a Reese Witherspoon-produced comedy show. “While the reviews have so far been dismal, they have launched their own original content,” said Munster.In music, too, Apple has missed a beat. Its success with Apple Music comes after five years of struggle that led it to rebrand Beats Music as Apple Music and follow Spotify and others as consumers showed more willingness to pay for music on a subscription basis than by the track.A future in which Apple offers video, music and publishing content at $15 a month is probable, Munster says. Like Amazon – or Netflix – Apple sees rich sources of future revenue from subscriptions to content in the cloud.At the Beacon on Monday, Apple learned – as it did when it automatically inserted a free U2 album into customers’ iTunes libraries – that not everyone is grateful for its sponsorship.When Smith thanked Apple during her performance, her gratitude was met with boos. The singer deftly sidestepped the issue, retorting that maybe one of the hecklers needed the bathroom. “I normally just piss in a can or dig a hole,” she added before launching into her Radio Ethiopia track “Pissing in a River”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7713b21ba327a796481875257c1e6cc5017e9fe/2_0_10663_6400/master/10663.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5c1905ee68409ea68a051282bb7fe106","title":"googles talk to books or how one day ai could lose its mind","story":"The search engine’s new feature is being sold as a creative tool – but mainly it’s a collection of semi-coherent and accidentally profound sentencesI’m confuddled by Google’s new search feature. Talk to Books lets you ask whole questions, and pulls up a list of responses from 100,000 books in the Google Books database. In theory, this is incredible. We know the internet is a trash can of terrible people and misinformation – a kitten clutching a cat-print edition of Mein Kampf and aggressively selling you maxi dresses. But books! Books are portals to the greatest minds of recorded time. Why ask Jeeves when you can ask PG Wodehouse? Or Montaigne or Tolstoy or Woolf? They’re sure to know more than Reddit. And at times, the tool does seem strangely wise.But there’s also something disorienting in the experiment, in which answers are given to slightly different questions than the one I ask. Sometimes they’re dry and literal. “What is death?” generates passages from medical textbooks, but nothing more spiritual. “Do you know the way to San Jose?” pulls up a Los Angeles hiking guide, which advises me to take the 118 Freeway West, then park in a dirt lot to the right. But it doesn’t ask where I’m coming from. I’m not sure I know where it’s coming from either – frequently, it sounds quite mad. “How deep is your love?” yields Charles Darwin’s thoughts on the evolutionary reduction of crest in Silk fowl. (Probably good the Bee Gees cut that verse.)It is refreshing, though, to step away from personalising algorithms and data tracking, which have given us a curiously claustrophobic internet, closer to a hall of mirrors. We’ve built a servile model of technology, and invariably imagine its flipside – the single-minded, aggressive robot uprising. Talk to Books presents an alternative vision of AI: the rambling pub bore. Semi-coherent, undeniably literate, accidentally profound. It suggests the future of the internet may be far stranger than predicted. What if a vast intelligence, that contains the sum of human thought patterns, and can predict exactly what we want, becomes bored of our questions? What if, knowing too much, it simply starts to lose its mind?The Chuckle Brothers are to return to our screens, after a 10-year absence. The main takeaway from the news is, surely: only 10 years? I’m used to internet memes reminding me things are depressingly older than I remember. We’re closer to the year 2036 than we are to Jennifer Lopez’s Grammy dress! Rupert Grint is turning 30! The sandwich you enjoyed this morning? You actually ate that on a Pict settlement in the Dark Ages! You’re going to die very soon LOL!Even in my youth, I recall Chucklevision’s premise being flimsy. Two naive painter and decorators, who seemed to be 100, but were probably no older than Rupert Grint is now, displaying a formulaic incompetence at their job. (Sadly, as an adult, I can relate.)What can this pair of mustachioed buffoons possibly offer a new Channel 5 audience, raised on Towie and Tinder and terrorism? We no longer live in innocent times. No one chuckles any more. Tinchy Stryder summed up Paul and Barry’s chances back in 2014, singing “Fuck all that me to you to me to you stuff” on his diss track, To Me To You (Bruv). And that was a voluntary collaboration with the pair, for charity.I’m worried they’ll be eaten alive. Or succumb to dispiriting, channel-mandated storylines about leaking client nudes by accident, winding up on a reality dating show, or being caught up in riots, and throwing their ladder into the window of a Footlocker. Hang on, what am I talking about? These storylines sound amazing. I’ve changed my mind. Roll on the Chuckle Brothers reboot!It’s been officially confirmed that children have greater energy levels, metabolic capacity and recovery rates than endurance athletes. The next step is obvious. A no-holds-barred Olympics, in which six-year-olds compete against sports professionals, who are encouraged to take all the steroids and stem cells they can handle, to level the field.

This year, for example, Morrisons is selling a Ramadan countdown calendar, similar to an Advent calendar, aimed at children.The month-long Muslim religious observance starts in mid-May and its ending is marked with the Eid al-Fitr holiday. MAC cosmetics, the Body Shop and Goa chocolates are some of the brands specifically packaging goods as Eid gifts.Despite the trend, more than three-quarters of British Muslims want retailers to pay even more attention to Ramadan, according to the Great British Ramadan, a study by an Islamic marketing consultancy Ogilvy Noor.“Muslims feel that Ramadan and Eid are ignored, the report says. “They see the nation proudly gravitate towards cultural and religious holidays such as Chinese New Year and Diwali. They are saying it’s also time to embrace Ramadan and Eid.”In an indication of growing awareness of the lucrative opportunities of the Muslim market, Westfield London, Europe’s largest shopping centre, is hosting its first Eid festival in June. It will include live catwalk shows, pop-up food stalls, special offers and performances.“The Muslim pound is seen as a valuable and largely untapped opportunity in the UK economy,” says festival promotional material.The global Islamic economy is forecast to be worth more than £3 trillion by 2021, according to the State of the Global Islamic Economy report, and is growing at nearly double the rate of the general worldwide economy. The sector includes halal food, Islamic finance, halal travel, modest fashion, halal media and recreation, and halal pharmaceuticals and cosmetics.Shelina Janmohamed, vice-president of Ogilvy Noor and author of a 2016 book, Generation M: Young Muslims Changing the World, says: “The Ramadan season is one of complete life transformation, which brings with it an economic surge.“We conservatively estimate this to be upwards of £200m each year, covering everything from financial planning to food, eating out, clothes, toys and gifting. Following only Christmas and Easter in scale and size, this is surely Britain’s biggest untapped business opportunity.”Many of the UK’s four million Muslims begin to prepare for Ramadan two weeks before its start date, which is determined by the lunar calendar. The month is characterised by sunrise-to-sunset fasting. Although in some countries the working day is adjusted to accommodate the season, for many British Muslims the fasting requirement is complicated by the need to continue working or studying.For the second year running, Ramadan falls within the six-week summer exam season, which means hundreds of thousands of school and university students have to take exams when their concentration may be impaired by lack of sleep, food and water.The absence of official recognition in the UK of the three-day Eid holiday immediately following the end of Ramadan means traditional visits to family and friends end up being spread over two weekends.“In the UK, you don’t have three days of shutdown over Eid like you do in the Middle East,” says Janmohamed. “Only about half of people take time off work, so Eid visits and celebrations are spread out.”She said brands and retailers should wake up to the opportunities of the Ramadan season. “If brands can play a useful role in Muslims’ experience of Ramadan, if they can help with planning or freeing up time for spiritual or social activities, that is very welcome.”Almost two-thirds of Muslims plan financially for Ramadan and Eid, the study found. More than half are concerned about their concentration during the month-long daylight fast and two-thirds worry about dehydration. Young men in particular are concerned about maintaining fitness and some gyms in areas with big Muslim populations adjust opening times to allow exercise between iftar, the sunset meal that breaks the fast, and suhoor, the pre-dawn meal.The majority of British Muslims eat a range of food over the two meals, with chicken and chips a favourite for 18-to-24-year-olds. Despite the long hours of fasting, four in 10 married women say putting on weight during Ramadan is a worry. Gift-giving, buying new clothes, eating out and family gatherings are key features of the Eid holiday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c7367799adc822bdfd24c4f8625cef7eff67e830/0_80_1200_720/master/1200.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=35d69f76f4e11be8bdd1e38e50a78438","title":"my financial future can i have my brunch and eat it too","story":"The options appear to be: never socialise and stay in to save for a house, or live a normal, modern urban life and spiral into debt. But is there a third way?Sitting firmly in the middle of the millennial generation (those born 1981-2000) and I’m told I could easily afford to buy my first home in London if I just give up: coffee, my gym membership, an annual weekend away, takeaway food, and a mobile upgrade, or one night out a week, for five years – or avocados.Sure, London living is afforded by renting the equivalent of a dodgy hostel dorm, nights out revolving around two-for-one deals, and “side-hustles”, which is a glorified term for my three jobs. So, should I accept that I can’t have my brunch and eat it too? Living paycheck to paycheck isn’t the dream and maybe neither is owning a home, but there must be a way I could at least consider the option.I’m certainly not alone, but maybe we’re placing too much value on “Yolo” – apparently a typical habit of young people today – so I’ve asked Paul Bridgwater, head of commercial and proposition at financial services provider OneFamily, and millennial lifestyle and personal finance expert Lisa Rowan from The Penny Hoarder what they think – and luckily neither suggested a five-year period where I give up all that I hold dear.Is it really that hard to save in a big city or am I being led astray?Rowan suggests that, unfortunately, it’s not all in my head. “Affordable, low-amenity units are being replaced with luxury buildings that are simply out of reach for many people, especially young people in the early stages of their careers,” she says. “This competitive housing environment means more workers in their 20s and 30s are enduring long commutes from the suburbs or are living with several roommates in order to make the most of their budgets.” But, Bridgwater says, while it can feel unattainable without the help from “the bank of mum and dad” we do have the benefit of living in a connected, digital age that can help us achieve our financial goals.I really value my social life – do I have to give up a chunk of it for five years?No, says Rowan, but there are some hacks to help make sure you don’t spend most of your monthly wages during the excitement of payday. In short, be at least a bit prepared. “Knowing the type of activity upfront can help you determine whether an event is a social and financial priority for you – then, it’s easier to make compromises. You may skip on the 12-person birthday dinner at a fancy restaurant, but you can still meet the group for drinks or dessert afterward. You can still go on a bar crawl with your friends, but perhaps eat a hearty meal before you leave the house,” she says.Bridgwater agrees, and says it’s safe to assume that most of your friends are in the same boat, so be straight up with them. “Money is a bit of a taboo subject for any age group, especially in the UK. On a practical level, earnings, savings and debts are not really discussed and perhaps they should be,” he says. “Like anything else in life, by talking and sharing issues, interesting solutions will come to light.”OK, so maybe I should be budgeting. What are some handy guidelines?Bridgwater says that budgeting isn’t the same for everyone, but taking away the temptation to spend is often the easiest way to save. “Create different accounts for your big expenses (housing, bills and savings) and then set up a standing order into these accounts one to two days after your wages go in from your main account. You’ll then know the money you have left in your main account is money you can spend,” he says.So, can I think about saving for a big purchase and still keep seeing my friends?Yes, says Rowan: “You can have your instant and delayed gratification at the same time.” A product like OneFamily’s stocks and shares Lifetime Isa is a good start when considering your options. With a Lifetime Isa, for every £4 put in, the government adds £1 – so save up to £4,000 a year and get £1,000 as a bonus (available after 12 months). Lifetime Isas are available either based on cash investments, which can be preferable for first-time house purchases in the short-term or stocks and shares investments, which might be preferable if you are aiming to buy your first home in five or more years, as they offer potentially better returns over the longer term, but be aware that capital is at risk.For information on the OneFamily stocks and shares Lifetime Isa, visit OneFamily.

The condition of a school for children with autism and profound intellectual disabilities in Co Cork has been compared to that of an orphanage in an underdeveloped country.They say the school, which has 43 pupils aged between four and 18, has not received any major refurbishment since it opened 20 years ago and students are going without physiotherapyoccupational therapy rooms or a sensory garden.Concerned parents and the school’s management have set up a Go Fund Me page in an attempt to raise funds after growing frustrated at the lack of action on addressing the issues by the Department of Education.“The parents say they feel forgotten. These are children who should be our number one priority,” he said.Sinead Desmond, chair of St Gabriel’s Parent’s Association, says the principal and teachers do everything in their power to assist the students, who are all non verbal, but that the primitive surroundings they find themselves in make this difficult.Ms Desmond said that when the building was originally purchased in the 1990s it was never intended for use as a special needs school. She said it was not suitably upgraded and the conditions resemble those seen in documentaries about old-fashioned orphanages in underdeveloped countries.“This is happening in Cork. My son Max’s wheelchair doesn’t fit in to the toilets in the school. So there are no toilet facilities for children in wheelchairs. It is fine when Max is seven and he is small and they can lift him on to a changing bed,” she said. “But they have men there who are 17 and 18 years old and are 6ft tall with complex medical needs. They are trying to maintain their dignity and they can’t. “Ms Desmond said many of the children have compromised immune systems which leave them vulnerable to infection in bad conditions.She said the school’s principal gave parents her blessing to speak out about the issues because they are running out of time after years of unsuccessfully applying for funding.“Our children only get one shot at childhood. Their childhood already has so many limitations and struggles that their school building really shouldn’t be one of them,” she said. “In Max’s classroom you used to have to open the door and stand back and a gush of dirty water from the roof would fall down. They had buckets collecting water in the classroom. The children in the senior side have nothing.”She added: “Regardless of how bad the building is (the students) love going to school every day. They love the staff. The principal is like a mom to those children but this building is substandard.”St Gabriel’s Special School, which is under the patronage of the Brothers of Charity Southern Services, is hoping to raise €200,000 through its online appeal.A Department of Education spokesman said the Government was committed to ensuring every child with special educational needs had the opportunity to fulfil their potential. He said the department was aware of the accommodation needs at St Gabriel’s and is committed to working with the school to address these."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3477012.1524866216!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"cervicalcheck chief did not want some women told of false results","story":"Tánaiste Simon Coveney has apologised to Vicky Phelan and her family, the 43-year-old mother of two was incorrectly given the all-clear from a smear test taken in 2011.\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tVicky Phelan from Annacotty, Co Limerick, was not told about an incorrect 2011 smear test until September 2017, despite a 2014 audit by CervicalCheck showing that the test was wrong. Photograph: Collins CourtsThe clinical director of the national cervical cancer screening programme advised a Limerick gynaecologist to file some audited test results rather than to tell women in certain cases that all-clear smear tests they had received years earlier were wrong.Dr Gráinne Flannelly, clinical director of CervicalCheck, told gynaecologist Dr Kevin Hickey in an email in July 2017 that several women in the mid-west region should not be told about the false negative tests discovered in an audit after he wrote to her to confirm that she felt some women with cervical cancer should not be informed about them.The private correspondence was submitted in the High Court case taken by Vicky Phelan, a 43-year-old mother of two with terminal cancer from Annacotty, Co Limerick who was not told about an incorrect 2011 smear test until September 2017, despite a 2014 audit by CervicalCheck showing that the test was wrong.The records emerged after Dr Flannelly publicly acknowledged that she could not say for sure that all of the 206 women who missed early treatment for cervical cancer had been made aware of the situation.Dr Hickey wrote to Dr Flannelly on June 20th, 2017 referring to a list of patients with cervical cancer noting that in three highlighted cases the women should be told about the false smear test results after a 2014 review.“There were other ladies where the review process has altered the original smear report and it looks from your notes that you have felt that these should be filed in the patients’ notes and that no review is necessary,” Dr Hickey wrote to her at the National Maternity Hospital, Holles Street in Dublin.“I just wanted to confirm that you are happy with this whole process centrally from the Cervical Screening Unit given that it looks that some of the review smears were different from the original.”Dr Flannelly replied on July 7th, 2017 in an email with the subject line “clarification”.“Yes – a balance needs to be struck in deciding who needs a formal communication of the outcome of the audit. The possibility of resultant harm is crucial,” she wrote.In cases where women have not had cancer or who have “local and fertility-sparing surgery”, Dr Hickey should “simply file” the audited test results in the patients’ medical notes, Dr Flannelly wrote.“The concept of delay is important,” she said. “I based my judgment on the medical information available to me and using the same criteria I use in my own practice when dealing with these cases. Only three of the women merited a closeout meeting using these criteria,” Dr Flannelly wrote.On August 8th, 2017, after being told by Dr Hickey that he had taken it upon himself to inform all the affected women, Dr Flannelly wrote to him again, noting his decision and saying that this “underscores the value of the local clinician reviewing the clinical context”.“The advice I gave was based on the limited information available to me and was given as an honest assessment of what seemed to be the best way to proceed with these cases,” she said.“It is right and fitting that your own clinical judgment should take precedence.” Yesterday, Minister for Health Simon Harris appointed a senior team of experts to examine the cases of the 206 women who missed early treatment for cervical cancer and to assess how many were not made aware of the delay in diagnosis.The appointments followed Mr Harris’s failure to declare confidence in the leadership of the programme. A HSE spokeswoman said Prof Flannelly would be “continuing in her role” and was “directly involved” in the process to provide assurance around the communications with the 206 women whose cases were under review.Asked about doctors using their “judgment” on whether to inform patients of wrong test results, the spokeswoman said the “practice was deemed to be appropriate and is in line with the practice in the UK for the communication of cancer audit reviews”."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Solicitor for Alison McCormack calls for review of pathologist\u0026rsquos cases at St James\u0026rsquosContentious two-storey religious and cultural centre meets stiff opposition from locals\u0026lsquoIdea is to encourage people to bring their dogs out and encourage good pet ownership\u0026rsquoMary Lou McDonald critical of way Vicky Phelan \u0026lsquopursued and forced into court\u0026rsquoClimate change scientists base findings on what happened to Scotland\u0026rsquos last glaciersOnline funding appeal seeks to improve conditions at St Gabriel\u0026rsquos in BishopstownDavid Gavin failed to return to surface while swimming in British Columbia last JunePerson climbed on to roof of unoccupied vehicle and cut lock before driving awayOfficer being treated in hospital for injuries to hand, head and body after Ballyogan assaultControversy after figures show 206 women may have had a delayed cancer diagnosisCouple told to wait for heartbeat to stop in pregnancy that would not go to full termPhelan\u0026rsquos court case brought to light failings of the CervicalCheck screening programmeInitiative follows rise in number of collisions and death of boy (12) in Dublin incidentAnnual Irish Red Cross ceremony recognises contribution to communities across the StateSister says Limerick artist Liam McCarthy (52) paralysed from eyes down after stroke\u0026lsquoIt is critical that Ireland joins with this coalition and supports efforts... the EU\u0026rsquos climate commitments\u0026rsquoIPU president criticises lack of progress in rolling out proposed healthcare strategy"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3478188.1525018581!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"mosque scheme in kilkenny heading way of planning board","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA copy of the Koran in a mosque. Trustees of the Kilkenny Islamic Centre have applied for planning permission for a religious and cultural centre. Photograph: Getty ImagesA controversial proposal to build a mosque and cultural centre on a site near the edge of Kilkenny city is likely to end up before An Bórd Pleanála, regardless of what decision the local council makes.Trustees of the Kilkenny Islamic Centre have applied to Kilkenny County Council for planning permission for a two-storey religious and cultural centre at the Hebron Industrial Estate but the plan has met with significant opposition locally, with one objector collecting 1,035 signatures against the idea.The deadline for submissions on the application has passed and 40 have been lodged with the council, most of them opposing the project. This follows a public meeting marked by angry scenes and concerns raised about the plan.The Green Party’s former mayor of Kilkenny Cllr Malcolm Noonan said at the weekend the “hate speech” voiced in recent weeks in relation to the proposal came from “a small number of people, most of whom have no connection to Kilkenny, nor are affected by the proposed mosque”.He said he would be supportive of the application “if it meets the planning requirements”.Cllr Noonan attended an open inter-cultural day hosted by the Kilkenny Islamic Centre last Friday and described it as “uplifting”.Among the attendees was Church of Ireland Bishop of Ossory Michael Burrows. Cllr Noonan said they have agreed to hold “further faith initiatives” in the area to promote understanding.“For those who sought to ide our community over this, it’s had the opposite effect by bringing us closer together.”Among the many submissions made on the plan is one by the O’Loughlin Gaels GAA Club.Club chairman Brian Murphy, himself a former inter-county hurler with Cork, said the submission was purely on traffic grounds. The site for the proposed mosque and cultural centre is close to the O’Loughlin Gaels complex.“We haven’t lodged an objection,” he told said. “We made a submission about the traffic . . . Our facilities are used by an awful lot of people, there’s a lot of traffic. There’s congestion at our main entrance a lot of the time.”One of the most vociferous objectors, former election candidate Eugene McGuinness, a brother of Fianna Fáil TD John McGuinness, said he collected 1,035 signatures from people living in the area near the site.“This is a very emotive issue, with religion and all involved,” he said, adding that “99 percent of people in the area don’t want that development”. Traffic can be stuck for an hour in the area on days of big games in nearby Nowlan Park, said Mr McGuinness. “Now they want to compound that . . . by adding 200 cars.”He denied his objection had any racist or sectarian motive. “There’s no issue in relation to religion. I said to the Imam on the night of that meeting that I would actively help him to find a suitable place.”His brother, John McGuinness TD, said he is not taking either side of the debate but did facilitate people with the planning process.A decision is possible in June but the council planners may seek further information in the meantime."},{"url":null,"title":"bertie ahern abruptly ends interview after being questioned on mahon tribunal","story":"  April 21, 2018Former taoiseach \u0026lsquohappy\u0026rsquo he cleared his name after allegations he received payments   April 22, 2018Fianna F\u0026aacuteil leader praises former taoiseach\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquotireless work for peace\u0026rsquo in Northern Ireland "},{"url":null,"title":"cork looks set to go to the wire in referendum on eight amendment","story":"  April 28, 2018Both sides in abortion referendum believe they have the edge.

Photograph: Patrick KovarikAFPGettyPresident Emmanuel Macron likes to convince people. In manner and method, he is unlike his predecessors. Nicolas Sarkozy cajoled and bullied. François Hollande just gave up. Macron fixes interlocutors with his intense blue stare and builds a Cartesian argument. If that doesn’t work, he starts over, patiently, but with determination.The past week has tested the young president’s powers of persuasion. Early in the hours of April 14th, Macron used his constitutional power as commander in chief for the first time, joining the US and Britain in launching cruise missiles against three chemical weapons installations in Syria. The goal, Macron said later, was to convince Bashar al Assad and Vladimir Putin that the international community was more than a “nice” and “weak” body they could push around.In a further exercise in persuasion, Macron volunteered for a combative, 2½ hour live television interview on Sunday night, during which he made the surprising claim that, “Ten days ago, President Trump said the US would pull out of Syria. We convinced him it was necessary to stay for the duration.”The White House later issued a statement saying Trump’s view had not changed, and the French president made an embarrassing climbdown on Monday, claiming he “never said” the US or France would remain militarily engaged in Syria for the long term.Perhaps Macron, whose nickname is “Jupiter”, is threatened by hubris, the sin of pride that afflicted Greek gods.The rest of the week was one long attempt to convince Europeans and the French of the rightness of his positions. Macron – who has become the de facto leader of Europe – received the heads of the three Baltic states who have teamed up with five other northern EU countries, including the Netherlands and Ireland, to thwart his efforts to further integrate the euro zone.Then, before a more sympathetic audience at the EU parliament in Strasbourg, Macron pleaded with proponents of liberal democracy to wake up and oppose the populist authoritarians who deny European values. Macron then travelled to Berlin in yet another effort to enlist German chancellor Angela Merkel’s support for his European reform agenda.On Monday, Macron will go to Washington for a three-day state visit, the first of Trump’s presidential term. Although the two men have clashed on climate change, the Iran nuclear accord, trade protectionism and the rise of Eurosceptical populism, Trump appears to have been charmed by the young president, who says Franco-American co-operation is crucial in the fight against terrorism.As the first anniversary of Macron’s election approaches on May 7th, and a half century after the May 1968 revolution, a different kind of spring is flowering in France. For the first time in decades, the country is reversing its post second World War decline, and the persuasive Macron is turning France into the world’s greatest soft power.There is, of course, discontent. It wouldn’t be France if there wasn’t. This week Macron also confronted striking railway workers in the Vosges, telling them to “stop taking people hostage.” The country is struggling through a rolling strike over the reform of the SNCF railway company.And despite Macron’s best efforts to reassure them, many in France suspect their young president is out to destroy the familiar but dysfunctional “French social model”. In their eyes, Macron is pushing France into the chasm of savage, race-to-the bottom capitalism.So what do they make of him in his home town? The  travelled there to find out.Macron was born in Amiens, the capital of Picardy, 40 years ago and lived here until just before his 17th birthday. From age 11 to 16, he studied at the Jesuit school La Providence.Built in the graceless concrete style of the 1950s, “La Pro” is an elementary, secondary and technical school for 2,000 pupils, spread over several acres. Aside from occasional crucifixes, calendars of Pope Francis and portraits of St Ignatius of Loyola, the religious footprint is light. The teachers are lay people. The priest visits only once a week now.Not a single plaque or photograph records that the president and first lady of France passed through these corridors. Yet this is where Macron asked to be baptised at the age of 12, and where, at 15, he fell in love with his future wife, a French and drama teacher called Brigitte Trogneux Auzière.Macron has always been drawn to older people. His maternal grandmother, Germaine “Manette” Nogues, died in his arms five years ago, at the age of 97. The Protestant humanist philosopher Paul Ricoeur was a spiritual father to him the progressive socialist millionaire Henry Hermand his political mentor. “He’s attracted by knowledge, by people who have experience,” his neurologist father, Jean-Michel (67), says over lunch in Amiens.At La Pro and subsequently at Henri IV, France’s leading lycée and prep school in Paris, Macron often stayed after class to talk to teachers.Marc Defernand (78) taught Macron history and geography here, and was principal of Macron’s section. “He was more mature than other students,” says Defernand. “He always asked a lot of questions. Sometimes he would pick up a conversation we’d started eight days earlier, exactly where we’d left off.”In the autumn of 2016, Defernand queued in a local bookshop to ask Macron to sign his autobiographical manifesto, Révolution. The retired educator is moved, recalling what happened. “He grabbed me by the hand and said, ‘Monsieur Defernand! It’s so good to see you!’” Macron inscribed the book: “To Marc, this ‘Revolution’, which owes more to him than he knows. In friendship, Emmanuel.”We visit the 700-seat theatre where Emmanuel Macron and Brigitte Trogneux Auzière adapted a play by Eduardo De Filippo together.“He was dynamite,” Defernand says. “I told him that if he continued, he would be the Gérard Philippe of the 21st century. It was difficult for others to act in the same play with him. In the same way, it’s difficult for his cabinet ministers now.”Defernand wasn’t aware of the relationship at the time, though he knew Macron went often to Auzière’s house. “I assumed there was a flirt between him and her daughter Laurence,” he says.The scandal of a married teacher with three children having an affair with a student nearly 25 years her junior has been transformed into romantic legend. Everyone would rather forget the trauma.“Jesuits never pried into people’s private lives. There was no morality investigation,” Defernand says. “There were unmarried teachers living together at the time. I was more worried about students taking drugs.”The fact that Brigitte continued to teach at La Pro for years after her lover’s departure, and then transferred to Lycée St Louis de Gonzague when they began to live together later in Paris, is further evidence of tolerance, Defernand says.A tragic love story, known to most French people, occurred a quarter-century earlier and helped pave the way for Macron and Auzière.Schoolteacher Gabrielle Russier (32) had an affair with a lycée student half her age, Christian Rossi, in Marseille. The youth’s parents filed a complaint against the teacher and had their son placed in a mental hospital. Russier was given a suspended prison sentence and took her own life. The story became the subject of books, films and songs. Asked about it at a press conference, former president Georges Pompidou famously quoted a poem by Paul Eluard that was sympathetic to women accused of having slept with German soldiers during the war.The historian Jean-François Sirinelli\u0026nbspcompares the Russier and Macron stories in his book Les Révolutions françaises, to show how much France evolved in a single generation. “Gabrielle Russier takes her own life in 1969. Emmanuel Macron and his teacher start an affair in the 1990s, and in May 2017, Brigitte Macron becomes first lady of France.”Macron’s parents learned of the affair by chance. “My wife was much more upset than I was,” Prof Macron says. “It may sound macho, but I thought he’d get over it. He didn’t . . . I thought it was a little early. It wasn’t the way I envisioned life, but it wasn’t my life. I raised my children to be free and independent.”The Macrons didn’t consider filing charges against Brigitte Auzière, but they asked to meet her. “I was requisitioned to impose authority,” Prof Macron laughs. “I told her, ‘He’s a minor. I want him to complete his studies. After that, he’s free to do what he wants.’”The president’s parents have been hurt by press reports that they sent their son to Paris to get him away from Auzière. “He was going to go to Henri IV anyway. It was planned,” Prof Macron says, nonetheless admitting that perhaps Emmanuel “went a little early”.At La Pro, I ask a class of 14-15 year-olds, Macron’s age when he met Brigitte, if they could fall in love with a teacher. The teenagers laugh and say yes. “If it happened to someone our age, it would shock me,” says a student called Grégoire. “But now that he’s an adult, it doesn’t bother me.”The students say it’s “cool” that Macron is president. “He was elected because there was Marine Le Pen,” pipes in Ayoub, of north African origin. Perhaps parroting their parents’ opinions, the youths object to rising taxes and praise the appointment of cabinet ministers who are not professional politicians. For the future, they predict flying cars and tell me France will never know full employment.On a scale of one to 10, they give the young president an approval rating of seven. “He has to prove himself,” one explains. Like France, Macron’s successors at La Pro are waiting to see.The Amienois may seem blasé about their president, but his father attributes this attitude to the “taciturn, reserved” character of Picard people. The region particularly suffered in both world wars, has a miserable climate and has been decimated by de-industralisation.His son is an atypical Picard, “an extrovert” infused with the sun of the southwest on the side of his mother, Françoise Nogues-Macron.History and bloodlines led me to Macron père, to find out more about the family’s English ancestry. In February, Macron spent an evening with the Presidential Press Association. As the representative for foreign journalists, I was part of the welcoming party. I gave him a sepia postcard of English soldiers in Amiens in 1918. \u0026nbspMacron studied the photograph closely. “You know, they found me an English great grandfather,” he said with a laugh, staring at the postcard. “He was called George Robertson.” The president scrutinised the English faces for a long moment. He was looking for a face that resembled his own.Towards the end of last year’s presidential campaign, Brigitte Macron mentioned to British journalists that her husband had a great grandfather called “Mr Robertson from Bristol”. The London Times, Mirror and Daily Mail researched the story and told the Macrons more than they had ever known about “Mr Robertson”.George William Robertson was born in Bristol in December 1887, and is believed to have fought in the Battle of the Somme. Distant relatives in England have preserved his war medals.Robertson married Macron’s great grandmother, Suzanne Leblond, in the town of Abbeville, 40km from Amiens, in 1919. They had three daughters. The middle daughter, Jacqueline, born in 1922, was Emmanuel Macron’s paternal grandmother.“He disappeared from one day to the next,” Prof Macron told me. “No one in the family ever heard from him. Suzanne raised three daughters alone. She kept a very modest grocery shop in Abbeville. My parents sent me to live with her and my aunts for two years as a child.”The failed marriage to an Englishman “was never, never talked about. The family kept no trace of him. I never saw a picture,” Prof Macron continues. George Robertson married again, settled in east London and kept a grocery shop, like his ex-wife, Suzanne. A step-daughter told the Mirror that he liked to sing Roses of Picardy, which he had learned in the trenches.Had a butcher from Bristol not fought in the Somme, married a Frenchwoman and fathered her children, Emmanuel Macron would not exist, would not be president of France today.Macron’s intellectual precociousness and his relationship with Brigitte meant he “skipped his adolescence”, his father says. In the autumn of 1993, three months short of his 17th birthday, the future president moved to a garret near the Lycée Henri IV in Paris. \u0026nbspHe continued his relationship with Brigitte. “When I went to see him in his chambre de bonne, sometimes he called through the door for me to come back later,” Prof Macron laughs. “I knew she was there with him.”Christian Monjou taught Macron American and British civilisation for three years at Henri IV. Though he did not know about the romance, Monjou noticed that Macron raced off to Amiens the moment classes ended on Saturday. “It was a case of\u0026nbsp ‘the ided self’,” Monjou says in an interview in his book-lined study.Macron obtained his baccalauréat with honours, but twice failed the entrance exam for the École Normale Supérieure, which trains French academics. It was the only failure of his life. Had it not been for the distraction of romance with Brigitte, Monjou says, Macron would have succeeded in the exam and become an academic.Against all odds, Brigitte Macron eventually orced and moved to Paris to live with Emmanuel. They married in 2007. “Without her, I would not be me,” Macron said during the campaign.Macron went on to earn a doctorate in philosophy, then reoriented his life towards politics with degrees from Sciences Po and the École Nationale d’Administration (ENA). “He used failure as a launching pad,” says Monjou. “That is typical of a leader.”“Have you brought your helmet and bulletproof vest?” the taxi driver who takes me to the Whirlpool clothes dryer factory in north Amiens asks. It’s a joke, of course, but the “Whirlpools” are notoriously hostile. A year ago, Marine Le Pen promised their factory would not close if she became president. Macron ignored advice and plunged into the crowd of angry strikers, saying, “If you listen to the security guys, you’re dead.”The factory will move to Poland at the end of May. Most of the 290 workers have been promised retraining or jobs building “intelligent” refrigerators by the factory’s new owner. But they’re still angry. On the day I visit, management proposed a clothes dryer in lieu of a severance bonus.“Macron, Macron. He’s not a god. We’re losing jobs. We don’t give a damn about Macron,” François Gorlia, the in-house union leader, tells me on the phone when he refuses to come to the gate to talk to me.“He’s a right-wing guy. Everything for the rich. Nothing for the poor,” Sibylle (39), an assembly line worker says as she arrives for the 1pm shift. She’ll benefit from Macron’s investment in training for the jobless, but she isn’t convinced. “Training is fine and dandy, but there are no jobs.”After lunch in a simple bistro, Macron’s father Jean-Michel guides me through a maze of streets under construction, to the music conservatory where his son studied piano for nine years. When he failed the conservatory exam after his first year, Macron’s mother told his biographer Anne Fulda, the boy insisted on having the same examiner the second year, an early sign of his determination to convince. He played well, Prof Macron recalls, mastering Bach’s devilishly difficult Goldberg Variations.Prof Macron gives me the address of the modest, two-storey brick bungalow where Emmanuel and his two siblings grew up, and where the neurologist still lives with his second wife. “It’s not Neuilly,” Macron père says laughing, referring to the Beverly Hills-like Paris suburb where Nicolas Sarkozy came from. Though they are both doctors, Macron’s parents earned low, public sector salaries. “They weren’t neurosurgeons with private jets,” comments a presidential adviser.The Trogneux chocolate shop, near the cathedral in central Amiens, is where Brigitte Macron’s family have made chocolates and macaroons for five generations. They also own the local Renault dealership.Black-and-white photographs of successive generations of the Trogneux chocolate dynasty hang inside the shop. There is no photograph or mention of Brigitte Trogneux Auzière Macron. Jean-Alexandre Trogneux (57), the first lady’s nephew and godson, agrees to be photographed, but refuses to talk about the presidential couple. “We’ve made it a golden rule,” he says. “We don’t talk about them and they don’t talk about us.”Fabien Dorémus (32) heads the political book section of a shop in central Amiens. Macron’s Révolution sold more than 400 copies there, an “enormous” number, Dorémus says. He had no desire to read it, and dismisses the book – and Macron – as “all slogans and clichés”. A former journalist whose local online newspaper failed for lack of funding, Dorémus is close to the far left party France Unbowed.\u0026nbspSince Macron’s election, Dorémus says, “I’m not optimistic for workers, pensioners and people who need public services. I am very optimistic for the rich.”The bookseller mentions various left-wing grievances against Macron, arising from a handful of disparaging remarks since 2014: Macron referred to slaughterhouse workers who were losing their jobs as “illiterate” Macron told a heckler wearing an anti-Macron T-shirt, “The best way to buy a suit is to get a job” Macron called protesters against his labour reforms “slackers” and accused strikers of wanting to foutre le bordel, or wreak havoc.It’s hardly “let them eat cake”. But the president has been hanged and burned in effigy by protesters. “You have to put yourself in the place of the people who get told they are slackers and freeloaders,” Dorémus says. “He’s contemptuous of the lower classes. People started hating him because they feel disrespected.”Another criticism, made by Macron’s former teachers, is that his speeches are often so long and intellectual that they can be difficult to follow.And attempts to control the president’s image can be counterproductive. The novelist Emmanuel Carrère was given exclusive access to the president and first lady. In two interviews with Macron, there was “one really strong, beautiful sentence”, Carrère wrote in the . “And this really strong, really beautiful sentence was off the record. In its place I was given permission to use a perfectly dull, perfectly formatted variant.”In the course of a day in President Macron’s home town, there is not a single photograph of him to be seen.Brigitte Fouré, the city’s mayor, tells me the poverty rate is two percentage points higher than the national average, and 80 per cent of inhabitants qualify for social housing. Amiens is ided between disadvantaged north and middle-class south. It was ruled by a communist mayor for 18 years in the 1970s and 1980s.Macron spent less than 17 years in Amiens, Fouré notes. He “went up” to Paris nearly a quarter of a century ago. “People here don’t know him. A lot of people are proud that the president is from Amiens, but that’s it. There has never been a real relationship between him and the city. There is no emotional tie.”On a beautiful spring day, the Élysée Palace feels light years away from dreary Picardy. The top-floor office of a close presidential adviser has a view over the gardens and the Eiffel Tower in the distance.Macron’s entourage is comprised mostly of fervently devoted young men with backgrounds similar to his own. No one at the Élysée, other than the president, can be quoted by name. “Our rule is that no one gets inidual credit for anything,” the adviser explains.The adviser reportedly thought up the slogan used by Macron when Trump pulled out of the Paris accord on climate change, “Make our planet great again!” But he refuses to confirm this. “We work collectively. Everything we do belongs to the president.”The adviser counts a resurgence of French pride as Macron’s greatest achievement so far. “It’s been a long time since the French have been proud to be French, in the eyes of the world,” he says. Though it contradicts my experience in Amiens, the statement rings true. Most people in the professional milieus of Paris adore Macron and are proud of his presidency.A few doors from the president’s office, the adviser lists Macron’s “important victories”: the revision of the labour code and the taxation of capital investments the overhaul of the country’s education system changes to the EU’s posted workers directive ending the giant squat at Notre-Dames-des-Landes and dismantling the nuclear reactor at Fessenheim. The last two issues had festered for decades. “They seemed impossible for any preceding majority,” the adviser says.Macron is doing as much for the disadvantaged as for the rich, the adviser insists. “We have increased basic payments to the poor, the disabled and the elderly. We’re decreasing social charges on lower salaries. The pendulum has swung much more towards the least advantaged than the most privileged.”So why isn’t that message getting through? Why do polls indicate that a majority consider Macron the “president of the rich”?For one reason, the adviser says. “He was an investment banker. What’s more, at Rothschild the most symbolic bank in the world. For many people, that proves his competence. The thing that makes him hated by some is the reason why he is respected by others.”Because Macron worked for four years as an investment banker, “everything he does that is perceived as right-wing or for the rich is blown out of proportion”, the adviser says.“And everything he does for the underprivileged, that would be seen as left-wing, is discounted. It’s a problem of perception.”Opinion polls can be read two ways. An Ifop-Fiducial poll published on April 10th gave Macron a 55 per cent approval rating, high for France, 11 months into a presidency. But a BFM poll published four days later showed that 44 per cent of voters are “disappointed”.Nine years of piano and the rigour of France’s best schools have honed Macron’s powers of concentration. On April 17th, he took questions from MEPs in Strasbourg for three hours, without notes, without so much as jotting down a question – a regular performance for Macron.“He is someone with a great capacity of attention and concentration,” says Monjou. “People who’ve met him often tell me they were struck by the intensity with which he looks at them, as if, for the time they are with him, they are all that matters.”“When you talk to him, it is as if he is downloading your brain,” says a former cabinet minister who sometimes advises Macron.Geraldine Byrne-Nason, now Ireland’s Ambassador to the United Nations, is doubtless the Irish official who knows Macron best. She became friends with the future president when both were “sherpas”, responsible for briefing and accompanying Irish and French leaders to EU summits, between 2012 until 2014. Byrne-Nason represented the taoiseach’s office, Macron the Élysée Palace.“We spent hours and hours in corridors through the night while the heads of state and government were locked in meetings,” Byrne-Nason recalls. “Emmanuel would be one of my first points of repair. If you’re going to be there for seven hours, you want someone interesting to talk to.”Byrne-Nason calls Macron “an insider-outsider” who has mastered the system but is able to regard it with detachment. “He has a healthy disrespect for bureaucracy, and Brussels is the home of process and procedure,” she says. “In that regard, we were kindred spirits. There was a slight impatience with the weight of slow-turning wheels.”Macron was particularly understanding of Irish difficulties during the bailout, Byrne-Nason says. She believes he was responsible for support offered by then president François Hollande.Byrne-Nason sent glowing reports about Macron’s potential to Dublin, long before he became a presidential candidate. Last September, she listened to what she calls his “extraordinary speech in favour of international co-operation and law” at the UN General Assembly. “It was poetic. It was powerful. It lit up the place.” Ireland could have signed off on every word, Byrne-Nason says, calling Macron “a superstar president who generates both respect and influence here amongst the 193 countries of the UN”.If Macron were Irish, he might be a hybrid of President Michael D Higgins and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar: part poetic intellectual, rooted in left-wing Christianity and fascinated by ideas part dynamic young liberal, determined to make the economy flourish.When Christian Monjou was Macron’s teacher at Henri IV, he says Macron talked a lot about the Fabians, the centre-left British intellectuals who founded the London School of Economics. The Fabians believed in “the inevitability of gradualness, the idea that everything that is gradual you won’t be able to go back on,” Monjou says. “It is totally anti-French, with our tradition of revolution, not evolution.“French political life is saturated in ideology,” Monjou continues. “With Macron, there is something you might call empirical or pragmatic. It’s familiar to an Anglo-Saxon, but it stands out in France. I suspect this slightly Anglo-Saxon approach may come from listening to me for three years.”Macron’s adviser stresses he is more than a mere pragmatist who would be content to solve one problem after another. “The two legs of Emmanuel Macron are action and reflection,” he says. “He always does both.”Macron’s en même temps mantra seeks to reconcile irreconcilabables, such as liberalism and social protection. The challenge is most obvious in his self-described “humane but realistic” immigration policy. Measures such as the Collomb circular, which authorises police to search emergency shelters for illegal migrants, have alienated some of Macron’s closest allies.In 1997, Macron’s spiritual father Paul Ricoeur delivered a lecture titled Foreigner Myself. Ricoeur cited Leviticus, about “the stranger that dwelleth with you”, and the Gospel of Matthew, which says: “I was a stranger and you took me in.” Opponents of Macron’s tough immigration policy say he has betrayed Ricoeur’s ideals. The criticism must sting, but Macron believes that unless he calms fears of unlimited migration, extreme right-wing populists will continue to gain ground, in France and across Europe.The necessity of ending the “society of status” in which family background, education and profession determine all aspects of one’s life, “gives coherence to everything we are doing”, says the presidential adviser.Philippe Aghion, who teaches economics at Harvard, the London School of Economics and the Collège de France, has greatly influenced the president’s economic thinking.Contrary to Thomas Piketty, the French author of the best-selling Capital in the 21st Century, Aghion and Macron believe that increasing social mobility, not high taxation, is the most effective way of reducing income inequality.Aghion wants to wean France off its post-second World War reliance on the Keynesian welfare state, in which government spending stimulates demand. He is inspired by John Maynard Keynes’s exact contemporary, the Austrian-born economist and Harvard professor Joseph Schumpeter, who believed that innovation and technical progress are the basis of a prosperous economy.Aghion’s theories underlie Macron’s reform of the French labour code last year, and the ongoing reform of professional training. It is, Aghion admitted in an interview, a liberal economic policy. But, he insists, it is also a social policy.Schumpeter believed in creative destruction, “which means you constantly have new jobs replacing old jobs, new firms replacing old firms”, Aghion says. It’s a hard sell to a French public that craves security and is adverse to change.Aghion advocates Danish-style “flexicurity” that combines labour market flexibility with unemployment benefits and retraining for laid-off workers. “In a nutshell: innovation, social protection and social mobility. That’s the triangle you want to achieve,” he says. Listening to him is like hearing Macron speak.Macron’s parents were left-leaning agnostics who did not baptise their children. At the age of 12, probably under the influence of his surroundings at La Pro, Macron asked to make his First Communion. A black-and-white photograph provided by one of his teachers, Gérard Banc, shows the future president making his profession of faith.Macron’s intellectual affiliation has been with the Christian left, with Ricoeur and Esprit magazine, for which he wrote a half-dozen articles, and whose board he sat on. French media interpreted gestures at Macron’s campaign rallies as signs of mysticism, for example when he asked his followers to “show benevolence”, or ended rallies Christ-like, with outstretched arms. On the night of his election, he concluded his speech in front of IM Pei’s glass pyramid at the Louvre with the words, “I will serve you with love”.During his evening with the Presidential Press Association, I asked Macron if, 28 years after his baptism, he still has faith. Personal belief is a taboo subject in secular France. Embarrassed laughter rippled across the room, but he addressed my question.“I believe in something we don’t see, yes,” Macron said. “I have faith in the generic sense of the term. If one doesn’t believe in one’s lucky star, in good fortune, in one’s country, one doesn’t do what I’m doing. I believe in a form of transcendency.”Following Macron’s April 9th speech to French bishops, leftists and Freemasons accused him of attacking la laicité, which has been France’s official policy of state-enforced secularism since 1905.“We share the confused feeling that the link between church and state has been damaged, and that it is as important to you as it is to me to repair it,” Macron said.\u0026nbsp The purpose of laicité was “certainly not to deny spirituality” he argued. \u0026nbsp“For biographical, personal and intellectual reasons, I have the highest opinion of Catholics.”There is something Jesuitical, indeed monklike, about Macron. Unlike his predecessors, he shows no need to eat, sleep or chase women. Asked what has been the “greatest trial” of being in office, the French president said he has “measured the weight and the solitude and the end of innocence” that come with power.“I do not think it is a trial,” Macron continued. “The French have authorised me to do what I committed to do. One thing is certain. There is no respite, which may explain why I sometimes look pale. I do not feel authorised to enjoy any form of leisure. I take time to reflect. I read and write. But in the times we live in, there is no room for respite. That may be the trial of power, though I don’t live it as such. There is undeniably a form of asceticism.”Macron sees his rise to power as the result of a troubled epoch. “I don’t forget where I come from and why I am here today,” he said. “I am the fruit of a form of brutality in history, of a break-in, because France was unhappy and uneasy. If I forget that for one moment, it will be the beginning of the trial.”"},{"url":null,"title":"telegraph launches next phase words chosen brand campaign","story":"The  has launched the second phase of the Words Chosen Well brand campaign which aims to showcase its award-winning quality journalism and raise brand awareness.The campaign started with a new television advert debuted during the commercial break of Channel 4’s Gogglebox on Friday 20th April. Created by adam\u0026ampeveDDB  in collaboration with The ’s in-house marketing and creative teams, it builds on the success of last year’s campaign with a bigger and bolder creative that utilises important cultural references and leans on some of the most emotive and impactful events of our times, highlighting iconic moments when words have been considered and chosen well.The ’s new campaign seeks to demonstrate the influence and importance of the spoken and written word, and the role that quality journalism plays in providing news, insight and analysis.

In practice, this means the infection is resistant to all commonly used antibiotics.The figures have emerged as Lord O\u0027Neill, the former Goldman Sachs banker who led a government-commissioned review into superbugs, accuses senior ministers of a lack of leadership on the issue. Lord O’Neill, former commercial secretary to the Treasury, said the Prime Minister, Theresa May, had allowed the issue to fade and that actions promised had not been taken.Lord O\u0026#39Neill has urged senior ministers to do more to tackle the threat of superbugs“It is disappointing to see that the UK government’s global and national efforts to fight AMR seem to have faded, he saidWriting exclusively for the  Lord O’Neill said that the UK was once seen as a leader in the field but that May had allowed the issue to slide.“The government should put this part of \u0027global Britain\u0027 back at the top of its priorities,” he writes. “There has been a lot of talk, but no action.Lord O’Neill’s review warned that if left unchecked antibiotic resistance would kill 10 million people and the world economy could lose up to $100 trillion by 2050.Antibiotic resistance | The true cost in Britain and around the worldOfficial figures suggest antimicrobial resistance claims the lives of 5,000 people a year in the UK, though experts have argued the real figure is at least double that. Getting global figures on the problem is difficult but reliable estimates suggest 700,000 are already dying each year – one person a minute.Lord O’Neill also attacked the major pharmaceutical companies for doing little to counter the problem, despite signing up to the Davos Declaration in 2015, where they pledged to combat the threat.He wrote: “Since then, no major pharmaceutical company has taken any fresh action.”Lord O’Neill said that since investigating the issue the number of reports of antibiotic resistance was rising faster and “in more places than we ever dreamt of.”.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:0}.html-embedponent .quoteponent ponent-content{margin-right:16px}.quote__source,.quote__author{white-space:normal}@media only screen and (min-width:730px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-60.83px}.html-embedponent .quoteponent .quote__content:before{margin-left:-12pxpadding-right:1px}}@media only screen and (min-width:1008px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-82.33px}}There has been a lot of talk, but no action.Lord O\u0026#x27NeillIn addition to the ‘super gonorrhoea’ case the PHE figures, obtained under a Freedom of Information request, show 29 people suffered from pan-drug-resistant-infections from Pseudomonas bacteria.Pseudomonas is a bug often found in soil or water (hospital sinks are tested for it) that usually affects people with a weaker immune system such as cancer patients, newborn babies, people with diabetes or patients with severe burns.Up to 11 per cent of Pseudomonas bacteria are now resistant to ciprofloxacin, an antibiotic commonly used in combination with others.A further six patients suffered pan-drug-resistant Klebsiella infections. New antibiotics to treat multi-drug-resistant Klebsiella infections were introduced last year in light of rising resistance, said Professor Peter Hawkey, a public health and bacteriology expert at the University of Birmingham. But they don’t work against every strain, he said.Antibiotic resistance | Global consumption fuels spread of superbugsProf Hawkey added that the cases show antimicrobial resistance is not a hypothetical or future threat but a real one currently affecting patients in British hospitals.These are organisms which are resistant to most antibiotics and then you’re in a tricky place, he said. The threat is very real. These figures are a wake up call,” he said.The pan-resistant infections recorded by PHE were from gram negative bacteria: rod-shaped bugs with thinner cell walls than their gram positive counterparts.Gram negative bacteria, some of which live in the human gut, are fast becoming resistant to antibiotics and are known as an emerging global threat. The government aims to halve the number of healthcare-associated gram-negative bloodstream infections by 2021.Prof Hawkey said pan-drug-resistant-infections are much more common in other areas of the world with lax surveillance and poor infection control, and these will spread to Britain.He said: With huge movement in populations people are coming back to the UK with these bugs in their guts. If you get it and you’re given the wrong antibiotic, you will die.Dr Susan Hopkins, deputy director for AMR and healthcare acquired infections at Public Health England, said: “While there is only a small number of bacteria identified that were resistant to a number of treatments in recent years, they serve as an example of the threat antibiotic resistance poses to public health.Madlen Davies is a reporter with the Bureau of Investigative JournalismProtect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security Mike Tindall finally gets his nose straightened out after breaking it at least eight times during careerHalf of TSB online banking customers still locked out of accountsWhat will Meghan Markle and Prince Harry\u0026#39s titles be after their wedding?Royal wedding guest list: Who did Meghan Markle and Prince Harry invite?Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026#39s royal wedding 2018: date, details and latest newsWhat\u0026#39s in a name?

one for each of his children - when departing from hospital and laughed that he had “thrice the worry now”.The Duke of Cambridge holds up three fingers as he tells the media he has \u0026#39thrice the worry now\u0026#39 as he leaves the Lindo Wing Louis was the first name of the Prince of Wales\u0027 beloved great-uncle Earl Mountbatten of Burma.Charles will be touched that the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge decided to pay tribute to Lord Mountbatten, who was murdered by the IRA in 1979, by naming their son Prince Louis.The name, also one of Prince George\u0027s middle names, is French and German in origin and means renowned warrior.Louis was the 71st most popular name in England and Wales, according to the latest available figures from the Office for National Statistics.In 2016, just 911 boys were given the name Louis in England and Wales.It was more popular in the early 2000s when it ranked around 39th, but was not popular throughout the 20th century.Louis has been the name of many rulers across the world, including 18 kings of France.Lord Louis Mountbatten pictured in 1977, two years before he was murdered by the IRAFamous people named Louis include pop star Louis Tomlinson from One Direction and jazz trumpeter Louis Armstrong.Lord Louis Mountbatten was also the Duke of Edinburgh\u0027s uncle and the brother of Philip\u0027s mother Princess Alice.He was the last British Viceroy of India before independence in 1947.He was very close to Charles but Uncle Dickie, as he was known in the family, was assassinated by the IRA in August 1979.His boat was blown up on a fishing trip off the coast of County Sligo in the Republic of Ireland.Prince George and Princess Charlotte had already been introduced to the new baby at St Mary’s Hospital and were likely being eased into their new roles as big brother and middle sister in their own home on Tuesday.Pippa Matthews, the first visitor seen driving into the Palace, spent several hours with her sister, the Duchess, and infant nephew before being photographed driving away.Pippa Middleton pictured leaving Kensington Palace on Tuesday afternoonParents Carole and Michael Middleton were unlikely to have been far away, famously supportive of the Duke and Duchess and their growing brood.Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, too, could surely not have kept away from joining the first eager visitors, living just next door and both adoring children.The Prince once called George and Charlotte “the most amazing things ever”.The Queen, who was in Windsor, is unlikely to meet her sixth great-grandchild imminently, with further duties at the castle on Wednesday, while the Duke of Edinburgh is recuperating privately from a hip replacement operation.The Queen horse riding at Windsor on Monday before the latest Royal baby was bornThe Prince of Wales, who was on Tuesday travelling to France in time for a dawn service to commemorate the Battle of Villers-Bretonneux on Anzac Day, will pay his first visit to hold the baby on his return from duty.Other family members earlier remained tight-lipped about the baby\u0027s name. The Countess of Wessex, who was conducting a string of engagements near Truro, Cornwall, said during a visit to Tregolls School on Tuesday: “I’m thrilled for them all, it’s lovely - really good news.”Asked about the baby’s name, she added tactfully: “The jury’s out on that one. I don’t know, we’re all just going to have to wait and see.”Sophie, Countess of Wessex meets pupils during a visit to a school in Truro on TuesdayAs the outside world clamoured for details, the Duke and Duchess appeared to simply get on with life: with two older children, even with the help of a nanny, they could hardly do less.The Duke, sporting a light stubble, was seen driving out of Kensington Palace on Tuesday afternoon, on an unidentified errand.Prince William leaves Kensington Palace by car on Tuesday afternoonOfficial celebrations were already under way, with the bells of Westminster Abbey ringing out from 1pm and gun salutes fired in London at 2pm.The soldiers, horses and Guns of The King\u0027s Troop Royal Horse Artillery rode out from Wellington Barracks into Hyde Park for a 41 round salute, and the Honourable Artillery Company (HAC), the City of London\u0027s Army Reserve regiment, fired a 62-round Gun Salute from The Tower of London.Video: Moment royal birth was marked by gun salutesThe baby joy extended not just to the Royal Family and avid monarchists.A young politan Police constable, Tyler O\u0027Hare, who took centre stage during the Royal baby\u0027s first public appearance outside the Lindo Wing was also celebrating.Sharing pictures of himself sternly keeping them safe by standing guard, he wrote on Twitter: “An honour and utter privilege to have been the ‘Door Officer’ for the birth of Their Royal Highnesses new baby boy!“Today was an amazing day and a highlight of my career!”The official commemorative souvenirs marking the birth of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge\u0027s baby son have gone on sale - before the new prince\u0027s name had been announced.Featuring a lion cub and unicorn inspired by the Royal Arms, the Royal Collection china is decorated with gold ribbons, silver pompoms and a coronet-inspired pattern.The pieces bear the words Welcome to our new royal baby and display William and Kate\u0027s coronet.The range of official commemorative chinaware to celebrate the prince\u0026#39s birth The official range includes a pillbox costing £35, a tankard for £39 and a plate priced at £49.Each item in the range is gilded with 22-carat gold and made in Stoke-on-Trent using traditional methods.There is also a pram-shaped woven decoration, made with glistening threads, delicate pearl detail, and embroidered on the back with Royal Baby 2018, for £14.95.Duchess of CambridgePlease review our commenting policyMike Tindall finally gets his nose straightened out after breaking it at least eight times during careerHalf of TSB online banking customers still locked out of accountsWhat will Meghan Markle and Prince Harry\u0026#39s titles be after their wedding?Royal wedding guest list: Who did Meghan Markle and Prince Harry invite?Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026#39s royal wedding 2018: date, details and latest newsWhat\u0026#39s in a name?

Indeed they say it has already had a detrimental impact on rare breeds such as the Mediterranean Gull, curlews and lapwings.Mr Allaway estimates the number of visitors arriving by boat has risen from 40 a day, to around 200, with a significant increase in kayakers and paddleboarders.They predict recent moves by the trust to promote Newtown as a visitor attraction - a large poster urging people to “explore” the reserve greets arrivals at Lymington Ferry Terminal a bear hunts for children have been organised at the site - will only exacerbate the problem.Mr Allaway said: “Our concern is that over promoting it and over commercialising it will only lead to its destruction by the sheer number of visitors who will come. The number of people who visit needs to be carefully controlled. The more publicity there is the more people will come, with visitors cutting through the woods and driving away wildlife such as owls, lizards and nightingales.“Mediterranean Gulls have recently started breeding in the lagoon, but they will be under threat from any further increase in visitor numbers and from growing numbers of dog walkers.”A view of Newtown Nature Reserve on the Isle of Wight Matters came to a head when the National Trust30. unveiled plans to refurbish the nature reserve’s visitor centre, which Mr Allaway and Ms Gwynn said had the effect of sidelining a much loved mural by local artist Anne TomsThe pair say the refurbishment was symptomatic of a tendency by the trust to excessively commercialise attractions to the detriment of the unique environment that makes them so appealing in the first place.“After we objected to their plans for the new visitor centre we were told that our services were no longer required as we were ‘contrary to their values’. It was particularly upsetting for Val, who has been associated with the trust for 30 years. It’s sent shockwaves through the community here.”The National Trust defended its plans for Newtown National Nature Reserve, - the only such reserve on the island - saying they would protect the site while still making it attractive for visitors, But it admitted it had faced opposition from volunteers and that its relationship with two of them had “broken down”.A black headed gull at Newtown Nature ReserveThe charity said: “Our absolute priority is – and has always been – to ensure wildlife can thrive at this special habitat and that people can continue to enjoy visiting it. We recently proposed some minor changes to the existing workshop space on the site, which will include a basic reception point where visitors are able to find information about the nature reserve and make themselves a hot drink. It’s clearly not a commercial venture and would have little impact on revenues.”It added: “We always appreciate honest views about our plans, and on this occasion we did have some opposition from a group of volunteers. We invited them several times for discussions to listen to their concerns and to reassure them that we would never do anything to compromise conservation.”“Unfortunately, we eventually reached a point with two iniduals where the relationship had completely broken down and we felt it was in the interest of both parties to go our separate ways.”A board showing recent bird sightings at Newton Nature ReserveIsle of WightMike Tindall finally gets his nose straightened out after breaking it at least eight times during careerHalf of TSB online banking customers still locked out of accountsWhat will Meghan Markle and Prince Harry\u0026#39s titles be after their wedding?Royal wedding guest list: Who did Meghan Markle and Prince Harry invite?Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026#39s royal wedding 2018: date, details and latest newsWhat\u0026#39s in a name?

There will be no more recruitment for especially domestic helpers. No more, Mr Duterte told reporters in the southern city of Davao.There was no immediate response from Kuwait, where around 262,000 Filipinos are employed - nearly 60 percent of them as domestic workers, according to the Philippines\u0027 foreign department.Last week the Philippines apologised over the rescue videos but Kuwaiti officials announced they were expelling Manila\u0027s ambassador and recalling their own envoy from the Southeast Asian nation.In quotes | Rodrigo Duterte, President of the PhilippinesKuwait also detained four Filipinos hired by the Philippine embassy and issued arrest warrants against three diplomatic personnel, Manila said.Mr Duterte on Sunday described the treatment of workers in Kuwait as a calamity. He said he would bring home Filipina maids who suffered abuse as he appealed to workers who wanted to stay in the oil-rich state.I would like to address to their patriotism: come home. No matter how poor we are, we will survive. The economy is doing good and we are short of our workers, he said.About 10 million Filipinos work abroad, seeking high-paying jobs they are unable to find at home, and their remittances are a major pillar of the Philippine economy.The Philippine government has for decades hailed overseas workers as modern heroes but advocacy groups have highlighted the social cost of migration, tearing families apart and making Filipinos vulnerable to abuse.Mr Duterte lashed out at Kuwait in February, alleging Arab employers routinely rape Filipina workers, force them to work 21 hours a day and feed them scraps.However after the latest row, Mr Duterte used a conciliatory tone as he addressed the diplomatic ruckus on Saturday.Apparently it seems as if they have anger against Filipinos ... I do not want to send (workers) because apparently you do not like Filipinos, he said in a speech before Filipinos in Singapore.Just do not hurt them. I plead that they\u0027d be given a treatment deserving of a human being, he said in the same event.Please review our commenting policyMike Tindall finally gets his nose straightened out after breaking it at least eight times during careerHalf of TSB online banking customers still locked out of accountsWhat will Meghan Markle and Prince Harry\u0026#39s titles be after their wedding?Royal wedding guest list: Who did Meghan Markle and Prince Harry invite?Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026#39s royal wedding 2018: date, details and latest newsWhat\u0026#39s in a name?

Possibly complicating matters was the fact that Denzel Washington was sitting next to him at the table.“When someone says you’re like your idol,” Jordan said, “It’s like: ‘Really? You see that in me?’ I’d only done that one movie. But then I started using it as motivation,” he said. “I wanted to pop up on Denzel’s radar. He’s the OG. If I could get recognition from him, I know I’m going down the right path, you know?”Denzel: We’re only getting further apart in this technological ageFinally, Washington broke in with a booming laugh: “And here we are, Mike! Looks like it’s working out already,” he said.In truth, it would be hard for an actor to choose a better role model than Washington. In a career ning more than 40 years and 50 films – and kicked off by the hit TV drama St Elsewhere – Washington, 63, has been nominated for nine Academy Awards. He won twice: for best actor as a terrifying rogue cop in Training Day and for best supporting actor as a Union soldier in an African-American army unit in Glory. And he was nominated for best actor Oscars in both of the past two years.Jordan (left, with Kevin Durand) in the 2013’s ‘Fruitvale Station’ (Weinstein Company)In the past decade, Washington has ruled the stage, too. He won a Tony Award for best actor in the revival of August Wilson’s Fences in 2010, later directing and starring in an Oscar-nominated film version. He led the acclaimed revival of A Raisin in the Sun in 2014. And today (26 April), he will open again on Broadway in a revival of Eugene O’Neill’s play The Iceman Cometh, a searing and (at four hours long) monumental drama about the lies we tell ourselves to get through life.Like Washington, Jordan, 31, got his big break on television: on HBO’s The Wire, when he was just 15. After his heartbreaking performance in Fruitvale Station, about the last day in the life of a transit-police shooting victim, he starred in the popular Rocky reboot Creed. And this year, he played the villain, Erik Killmonger, in the Marvel juggernaut Black Panther, winning perhaps the best reviews of anyone in the extremely well-reviewed cast.Next month, he stars in Fahrenheit 451 on HBO, a dystopian film based on the novel by Ray Bradbury. Jordan plays a “fireman,” part of a state-sanctioned brigade that hunts down readers and burns books. His company, Outlier Society Productions, is one of the film’s producers and also among the first to adopt inclusion riders, requiring ersity among cast and crew, as called for by Frances McDormand from the stage of this year’s Academy Awards.Over a cocktail hour at the Lambs Club in Manhattan (a Diet Coke for Washington, a sauvignon blanc for Jordan), the actors traded notes about creating characters and the socially minded work that really matters to them. These are excerpts from the conversation.Galanes: If Mike reminds people of a young Denzel, who did young Denzel remind people of?Washington: I never saw it that way. I never even thought about movie stars. My goal was to be on Broadway, to earn $650 a week. My hero was James Earl Jones. And I came to acting green. I was taking pre-law courses, then journalism courses. Then I took an acting class and got bit by the bug. So I came down to Lincoln Centre and saw plays and stage actors.Galanes: But all those things you did – law, journalism, acting – they’re all about getting to the bottom of a story, right?Washington: I like that part: building a character. You start with the material that gives you clues. If you’re playing a boxer, you want to throw out punches. If you’re playing a conductor, you want to get on a train.Galanes: And the script?Washington: Sure, but you don’t know who the character is just by reading the script. I don’t read a script and go, “Now, I get it!” That’s just the beginning. The first thread you pull.Jordan: The script tells you what’s going up on screen. But the biggest part, the fun part, is figuring out what happened to that character before page one of the script. What kind of food does he like? Did he get into fights going to school? That back story determines the choices you make within the confines of the script. And going through that process with the director is a big part of the collaboration. Now I’ve got notebooks and notebooks of back stories. Some directors may want you to add something or change your version. That’s when you try to find common ground.Washington won an Oscar for his role as rogue cop Alonzo in 2001’s ‘Training Day’ (Warner Bros)Galanes: Is that why you’ve both worked with directors repeatedly? Mike with Ryan Coogler Denzel with Spike Lee and Antoine Fuqua. Your common ground?Washington (laughing): Maybe they’re the ones who called. What you’re saying is part of it, but I don’t think it’s just one way.Jordan: Those are the roles I was lucky enough to get. Ryan and I have worked together three times, and I have a really close relationship with him. But I said no to lots of other things with other people in between. They weren’t right. Personally, I think you’re defined by what you say no to.Washington: I say yes to everything!Galanes: Why do I doubt that? Managing a career as big as yours must take a lot of work.Washington: Not now. Maybe early on. Now, I just do what I want to do. And you don’t want to walk down the same road twice. I’m sure after doing Iceman Cometh, I won’t be looking to do another play.Washington: Yeah, not for a while.Galanes: You’re too young to remember this, Mike. But early in his career, Denzel was so beloved for playing good guys – in Glory and Cry Freedom – that we all freaked out when he started playing villains: in Training Day, American Gangster. And he was even better at bad guys! Was that about walking down different roads?Playing Killmonger (right) in ‘Black Panther’ brought rave reviews for Jordan (MarvelDisney)Jordan: So much trickles down from the director. That’s why I try to choose the ones who make the best environments to work in, so we can maybe make something as good as Training Day. You don’t want to go into a project with somebody who won’t be helpful to your process – or vice versa.Galanes: I read this funny thing about you, Mike: you started choosing projects where you wouldn’t die in the end?Jordan: It started with my mom, who’s super emotional. When I shot my death scene in The Wire, she was on set. And the PAs kept coming to me and saying: ‘You may want to check on your mom.’ I go see her, and she’s sitting there bawling. I’m just a kid. I’m going, ‘Come on, Ma. You’re embarrassing me.’ And after Fruitvale Station, I was like, ‘Man, this is really affecting her.’ But there was another thing, too. Look at Denzel’s career. I want people to see me win. I want audiences to see me ending up on top – not dying. I want to be the leading man.Washington: Man, I got underwear older than that.Jordan: That was the real thought process: How do I become a leading man? I know phenomenal actors who can’t open movies overseas. How do you become the guy who can carry a film?Washington: So, you study the game?Galanes Is that why you went down the superhero route?Galanes You probably made up for it with Black Panther. Why no superheroes for you, Denzel?Galanes: Superheroes have changed. When Denzel might have played one, they were dull. The villains were interesting: Jack Nicholson and Heath Ledger. Like you in Black Panther, Mike.Washington: When I was a teenager, Shaft and Super Fly, those were our superheroes. I remember watching Super Fly with my boy Carl, and when we got back to the projects, he carved the character’s name – Priest – on the elevator door. And Richard Roundtree in those long leather coats in Shaft.Galanes: Both of your new projects are dark. Iceman Cometh is brutal. And in Fahrenheit 451, competing ideas are so scary that people decide to burn all the books and kill the readers. Why choose them now?27 films to look out for in the first half of 2018 27 films to look out for in the first half of 2018 Galanes: It’s powerful to watch a black man in your role.Jordan: But it wasn’t all there on the page. I needed to make sure that he was willing to collaborate, to change some things to help me, as a black man, feel more comfortable in that role. And my company’s co-producing it alongside HBO was important to me too. This is my first time working with the director and the network, giving my opinion and hoping that it’s taken seriously.Washington (laughing): Getting your big boy voice.Galanes Like coming back to the stage, Denzel?Washington: Yeah. Then we boiled it down to Iceman and King Lear. And he said: ‘Let’s do Lear five years from now.’ I said: “OK, we’ll do that next – God willing.”Washington: Eugene O’Neill. That simple. The chance to interpret his brilliant material. You know, my first role on stage, when I was a student at Fordham, was in The Emperor Jones. I’ve always loved O’Neill. And here I am, 40 years later, coming back to him in Iceman.Galanes: Your character, Hickey, seems like the life of the party at first, but what a tortured soul he turns out to be. What drew you to him?Washington: His desire to see people happy. Even when he knows he can’t make that happen, that desire is still there in him.Galanes: It’s a mountain of a play – four hours long. Is it hard to maintain that intensity every night?‘Fahrenheit 451’ sees Jordan plays a ‘fireman’, part of a state-sanctioned brigade that hunts down readers and burns books (HBO)Washington: Listen, this is what I love: acting on stage. And I don’t have to do anything else. Just be in this play. So, don’t feel sorry for me compared to most workers in America.Galanes: Is theatre on your radar, Mike?Jordan: Down the line. But right now, I want to take care of my family financially and grow my production company. That’s the big thing I want to do: set my family up.Jordan: As a kid, you don’t see your circumstances. I didn’t. It’s not until you look back and think, ‘Man, we were poor!’ My parents really hid that from me. They kept me safe.Washington: It wasn’t that tough. I was having a good time. A lot of my boys went to prison.Jordan: That’s why I want to take care of my family now. Then let me go and work on my craft, do something to fulfil me on the inside. That’s what I think theatre is going to be for me – when I’m older. What do you love about it, Denzel?Washington: The energy from the audience is immediate. And you get to develop a full life. See, in film, you might shoot the end first, then the middle. But on stage, it’s the full score of the character’s life. And you always get another night.Washington: In film, you don’t get another night to shoot a scene. You can try to fix it in other scenes. But film is a director’s medium. Theatre is for actors. We’re directed, but once the curtain goes up, it belongs to us. And every night’s as different as the audience. Some nights, they cheer the whole way through others, they don’t cheer at all.Galanes: Let me shift gears. We’re living through a time right now where men in power who’ve done ugly things –Washington: No. We’re not ‘living through a time right now’. It’s always been this way, from the beginning of time. Pick one: from Caesar to Caligula. Now, it’s just on the news cycle every 15 seconds.Jordan: And opinion is now fact – because anyone with a Twitter handle can say it.Washington: It doesn’t even have to be true it just has to be first.Galanes: Hang on, I’m asking something different: Based on your years as a powerful figure, why do you think some guys turn to ugly behaviour, and others don’t?Washington: Nobody’s perfect, man. Don’t put me on a pedestal, if that’s what you’re trying to do. I’m just a human being. I made mistakes I’ll make some more. Hopefully, you learn from them. My mother always said, ‘Keep it simple.’ The older I get, the more I understand her: cut away the fat. When you’re younger, you want to see, taste, touch.Washington (laughing): There you have it. But when you get to be my age, you learn you don’t have to. I have a beautiful wife, beautiful children, a great job. What more do I need?Jordan: And people like us, actors of colour, we don’t get a lot of second chances. It’s a different type of scrutiny. Knowing it’s not all fair and equal, you’ve got to make smart decisions in the moment.Washington: I remember going home one time and saying to my mother, ‘Hey, Ma, did you ever think that I...’ And she said: ‘Stop right there! Do you know all the people who’ve been praying for your raggedy butt?’ You don’t get there by yourself.Jordan: That’s crazy! I was just thinking: I’m going to church in the morning – because I know the people there have always prayed for me. Their blessings have protected me from terrible situations. That’s how I think about keeping it simple: remembering where it started – that village, that tribe that kept you safe.Galanes: And it was 38 years between Sidney Poitier’s Oscar for best actor and yours.Galanes: How about opportunities for people of colour?Washington: That’s why I’m here! That’s why I’m still in the race. And I’m passing the baton. What a lot of people don’t know is: when you pass the baton, you keep running behind the other runner, you don’t just stop. I’m like, ‘Make the turn, bring it home!’ I like helping people. I want to see them do well.Black Panther star reveals Denzel Washington paid for his acting classDenzel schools journalist with response to \u0027fake news\u0027 questionHow to stop Denzel Washington stealing your sceneJordan: That’s why I want to produce so much. I like creating opportunities for people.Galanes: You were right out of the gate on inclusion riders, Mike. The first to say, ‘My company guarantees that casts and crews will be erse.’Jordan: That’s super important to me. No matter what community we’re talking about. Everybody should be in a position where they can win.Washington: I’m just wired that way.Jordan: My path is my path. I can’t take nothing away from nobody, and nobody can take nothing away from me. I’m running my race. But we can still encourage each other.Washington: What’s the harm in that? You’ll never see a U-Haul behind a hearse.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The UK is also a top destination for wealthy Russians to spend their money on art collections, expensive cars and private schools for their children. In return, the UK often grants them visas and, in some cases, citizenship“We are going after the money,” Boris Johnson promised after being questioned on the absence of specific measures to impose sanctions and financial penalties on the UK assets of Russian oligarchs closely aligned to President Putin. But when pressed by MPs on why decisive action was not being taken, the foreign secretary replied: “This is not a country where we in the government can say ‘Oi! We think this so-and-so deserves to have his or her collar felt’. This is not how it works.” While Theresa May may yet impose sanctions against Putin-supporting billionaires in response to the attempted murder of the Russian spy Sergei Skripal, her government’s track record has been marred by procrastination and prevarication.   Privately, the prime minister regards the exploitation of London as a haven for dirty Russian money as a serious problem. She once listened in stunned silence as a senior MI6 officer briefed her on the activities of Russian organised crime and certain oligarchs in the UK. And in 2016 she authorised the National Security Council to review why and how wealthy Russians buy property in London. But she has been nervous about taking action. For the past three years she has dithered on implementing a legally-enforceable register that will force all foreign companies that own UK property to disclose the identity of their owners.Russia claims Skripals poisoned using toxin possessed by UK and USRussia has been spying on the Skripals for at least five years- UKRussia stock market crashes after US imposes sanctions on oligarchsFreezing property assets is the key to inflicting pain on the Russian state and its compliant plutocrats. Since 2004, £190m of UK property has been subject to criminal investigation as suspected proceeds of corruption. The London property market has been skewed by laundered money, as The Independent revealed exclusively in 2014. Prices are being artificially driven up by wealthy, influential, foreign men who want to hide their assets in the UK.Multi-million pound payments are accepted without their origin being questioned. Oligarchs hide ownership behind anonymous shell companies registered in secretive jurisdictions while a London address offers a veneer of legitimacy and prestige that helps launder reputations as well as cash. Transparency International estimates that Russians account for £729m of the £4.4bn acquired in UK property via what it regards as “suspicious wealth”.There is no suggestion that all London property bought by Russian oligarchs is derived from illegal or criminal sources. For some Russian plutocrats buying luxury property in London is a symbol that they have been accepted by the British establishment. This is illustrated by the eleven bedroom Regency house on Belgrave Square that Oleg Deripaska, regarded as one of Putin’s favourite oligarchs, snapped up for £17m through an offshore company registered in the British Virgin Islands in 2003 and now worth £45m.Oleg Deripaska’s 11-bedroom Regency house on Belgrave Square is seen as a symbol of acceptance by the British establishment (Alamy)Built in the 1820s, it was formerly the home of Sir Henry “Chips” Channon, society host, Conservative MP and notoriously indiscreet diarist. It was designed for entertaining royalty and diplomats with its grand staircase, Madame Récamier sofas and flamboyant decor. When Harold Nicolson arrived at the house for dinner, he exclaimed: “Oh my God, how rich and powerful Lord Channon has become.” The equally grand and historic mansion Beechwood House, set in 11 acres of land in Highgate, north London, was bought by the powerful oligarch Alisher Usmanov in 2008 for £48m from the Emir of Qatar. Usmanov is a major shareholder in Arsenal football club and has amassed a £14bn fortune from metals and commodities and has long been regarded as a pro-Putin figure. And his fellow football-loving oligarch Roman Abramovich owns houses on Kensington Palace Gardens and Chester Square, Belgravia, and apartments on Eaton Square and Manresa Road, Chelsea.  One Hyde Park, one of the wealthiest residencies in the world, was famously bought up by Russian oligarchs (Alamy)It is not just prestigious houses that attract Russian billionaires. The UK is also a top destination for wealthy Russians to spend their money on art collections, expensive cars and private schools for their children. In return for their cash, the UK often grants them visas and, in some cases, citizenship.  Since 2008 iniduals have been able to obtain “golden visas” if they invest as little as £2m in a UK business. And for £5m, they gain the right to become a UK resident on a temporary basis and then, after five years, a British citizen. By 2014, almost 700 rich Russians had paid for entry using this method, with Roman Rotenberg, son of Putin’s former judo partner Boris Rotenberg, being the most prominent example. He owns a mews house on Cadogan Lane in Belgravia.The government is taking some action to stop London becoming what David Cameron described as a haven to hide “dodgy foreign cash”. The National Crime Agency (NCA) is investigating a list of wealthy iniduals, not just oligarchs, to assess if they have used the UK to launder their fortunes.An estimated 149 iniduals are restricted on their travel and ability to conduct business in the UK. And the Unexplained Wealth Orders is now law, whereby the NCA can demand that the oligarch explain the origin of his wealth. But the problem with this order, according to a Russian businessman, is that the inidual in question could too easily lie about his source of wealth and instead produce a document that shows his fortune was based on, for example, share idends. Roman Rotenberg gained entry to the UK using the ‘golden visas’ method (Getty)Boris Johnson protests that the government cannot act directly against the pro-Putin brigade because it cannot interfere in criminal investigations. But it could make specific changes to the law, notably an amendment to the Sanctions and Money Laundering Bill, which would give Magnitsky-type powers to freeze the UK assets of relevant iniduals, including intelligence agents or other officials who have abused human rights.  The government could also implement the register of inidual owners of foreign and offshore companies that own UK property. But that bill has been delayed until 2021 and campaigners smell a cover-up after the government announced that one reason for the delay is that the Business Department has commissioned research on the impact of the register on investment decisions. “This is a crucial moment for the UK’s future trading relationship with the rest of the world, and we must proceed with as good an understanding as possible of the potential impacts on legitimate inward investment,” said foreign office minister Lord Ahmad. Skripal attack aftermath – in picturesSkripal attack aftermath – in picturesInvestigators in protective clothing remove a van from an address in Winterslow near Salisbury in Wiltshire, as police and members of the armed forces continue to investigate the suspected nerve agent attack on Russian double agent Sergei SkripaA police officer on duty near the protective tent which covers the bench where a man and woman were apparently poisoned with what was later identified as a nerve agent, in SalisburyMilitary in protective clothing prior to removing vehicles from a car park in SalisburyPersonnel in protective coveralls and breathing equipment cover an ambulance with a tarpaulin at the Salisbury District HospitalHome Secretary Amber Rudd visits the scene of the nerve agent attack in SalibsuryMembers of the emergency services in hazard suits fix the tent over the bench where Sergei and Yulia Skripal were foundOfficials in protective suits check their equipment before repositioning a forensics tent A poice officer stands guard outside a branch of the Italian chain restaurant ZizziDetective Sergeant Nick Bailey, who assisted the Russian ex-spy targeted with a nerve agent, was also hospitalisedSergei Skripal days before he was exposed to a mystery substance that has left him fighting for lifeSergei Skripal speaks to his lawyer from behind bars seen on a screen of a monitor outside a courtroom in Moscow.Yulia Skripal, who is thought to have been poisoned along with her father, Sergei SkripalProgress to legislation has thus been painfully slow. An insight into why political rhetoric has not resulted in legislative action can be gleaned by the recent flotation on the London stock exchange of the Russian energy company En+, then owned by Deripaska and chaired by former Conservative energy minister Lord Barker. For it revealed a fundamental dispute between MI6 and the financial regulators on how to make oligarchs who park their assets in London more accountable and transparent.MI6 and the prime minister’s national security advisor, Sir Mark Sedwill, were furious with the Stock Exchange and Financial Conduct Authority for failing to consult them and conduct the required due diligence of En+. Their main concern was about whether Rusal, a subsidiary of En+, had been manufacturing aluminium powder used by Russian arms firms for military purposes. Rusal adamantly denied it – yet its own website previously indicated that the defence industry was among the users of the type of aluminium powder it manufactured.Sir Mark Sedwill was furious when the required due diligence of En+ was not carried out ahead of its flotation on the London stock exchange (Getty)The En+ group could be a candidate for new sanctions as the Russian state-owned VTB Bank is a major shareholder with a 4.35 per cent holding, while Deripaska is known for being close to the Russian President. Leaked US diplomatic cables described Deripaska as “among the two to three oligarchs Putin turns to on a regular basis” and is “a more-or-less permanent fixture on Putin’s trips abroad”.Indeed, when the US imposed sanctions on seven oligarchs and the 12 companies they own or control last week, shares tumbled. Deripaska was among those affected, as was Rotenberg.  Still, Britiain cannot follow suit. And the anger of National Security officials and MI6 En+\u0027s flotation last year stemmed precisely from their belief that it typified the complacent approach to Russian money in London, which the infamous oligarch Boris Berezovsky once told me was “70 per cent dirty”. The inability to impose sanctions is similarly emblematic.The London Stock Exchange has long been a vehicle for Russian companies and oligarchs to raise money in shares and bonds – an estimated $200bn (£140bn) since 2004. Last summer, Russia’s largest gold producer Polyus, controlled by Suleyman Kerimov, a Russian senator awarded the Order of Merit by Putin, raised $879m. There are now 57 predominantly-Russian companies listed on the London Stock Exchange, more than anywhere else outside Moscow.   The wealthiest Russian oligarchs who call London homeA little-noticed loophole to avoid sanctions is that Russian sovereign debt is permitted to be sold in London. “We are allowing Russian sovereign debt to be sold in the UK and that debt is being used to reimburse Russians to bring back their money onshore in Moscow terms,” said the Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee. “As that gold is moving towards Moscow, we are quite extraordinarily enabling those bond and debt auctions...This is one of those areas where sanctions on businesses are being compensated by the Russian state.”Just hours after Theresa May’s retaliation against the poisoning of Sergei Skripal, Gazprom issued a $750m eurobond in London and the following day the Russian government joined in by issuing a $4bn bond in the capital. Within hours, the Russian Embassy issued a revealing tweet: “Business as usual?”Could the nerve-agent attack in Salisbury be the unwitting catalyst for finally cleaning up dirty Russian money in London? (Getty)But the irony is that it is the attempted assassination of a Russian spy and double agent living in Salisbury and the murder of Russian businessman Nikolai Glushkov in Surrey that could be the unwitting catalysts for finally cleaning up dirty Russian money in London.Mark Hollingsworth is the author of “Londongrad – From Russia with Cash’’ or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Others were able to log in but, when they did, some or all of their account details had disappeared.Customers have also reported that they could access other people’s accounts, including account numbers, sort codes and transaction histories.TSB apology after customers complain of online banking ‘data breach’​TSB could not say how many people were still locked out of the service or when the problems would be fully resolved.The ongoing IT disaster began with botched upgrade work on Friday, but has developed into one of the worst technology failures to hit a UK retail bank and has left many of TSB’s 1.9 million customers furious.Some said they were falling behind with bill payments.Others said they were worried their money had simply disappeared.Many customers expressed frustration that the bank was not being clear about what had happened.That came after Paul Pester, CEO of TSB, tweeted on Wednesday morning: “Our mobile banking app and online banking are now up and running. Thank you for your patience and for bearing with us.”Our mobile banking app and online banking are now up and running.

Potentially, millions of customers could be affected by uncertainty and disruption.“It simply isn’t good enough to expose customers to IT failures, including delays in paying bills and an inability to access their own money.”A spokesperson for the Financial Conduct Authority said on Tuesday that the watchdog was “aware of the issue and liaising with the firm”. A spokesperson for the Information Commissioner’s Office said: “We are aware of a potential data breach in relation to the TSB and are making enquiries.”Mr Pester said on Tuesday that he was “truly sorry” about the problems caused. “We’re still seeing issues with access to our digital services,” he added. “One of the steps we need to take to resolve this is to take our mobile app and online banking down for a few hours.“We did this at around 10.30 this morning and we hope to be back up later this afternoon.”The problems stemmed from a switch to a new online banking system. TSB had rented the technology behind its app and online banking from Lloyds Banking Group since the two companies split.

Under the current rules, anyone in the world is able to register an SLP.The changes being put to consultation by the Department for Business, Energy, and Industrial Strategy will also mean anyone setting up a limited partnership will have to pass anti-money laundering checks.While many SLPs are owned by legitimate businesses, government research suggests others have been part of complex attempts to launder the proceeds of criminal activities.One scheme is reported to have used 100 different SLPs to move $80bn out of Russia, while other partnerships were found to have been exploited by international criminal networks based in Eastern Europe and used in arms deals.Announcing the changes, business minister Andrew Griffiths said: “The UK has taken a leading role in the fight against money laundering and is known internationally as a great place to work, invest and do business.“But as we are seeing especially with Scottish Limited Partnerships, is that they are being abused to carry out all manner of crimes abroad – from foreign money laundering to arms dealing.“This simply cannot continue to go unchecked and these reforms will improve their transparency and subject them to more stringent checks to ensure they can continue to be used as a legitimate way for investors and pension funds to invest in the UK.”The government has taken a number of steps to stem the flow of dirty money through the UK.

People say put libraries in and health centres, but the Government does not have the money to fill the gaps that would be left by independent shops.                Two centuries of trading closes it\u0027s doors to be solely onlineALAMY 1,500 traditional \u0027bricks and mortar\u0027 stores closed across Britain in 2017The study on the state of the high street by the Local Data Company and Bira found that Yorkshire and the Humber, and Greater London, have suffered the greatest decline in independent shops in the past year.In Yorkshire and the Humber 460 stores closed, with 374 shutting in Greater London. However, the West Midlands managed to buck this trend, with 230 new stores opening.Telford has the lowest percentage of independent retailers, with Yate in Gloucestershire, Bracknell in Berks, Cowley in Oxfordshire and Salford in Greater Manchester the next worst.High street businesses visited by customers - like barbers, beauty salons and coffee shops - fared the best.As the Prezzo announces restaurant closures across the country.

Bloomberg via Getty Images1 of 14Prezzo, the restaurant chain, is shutting 92 branches across the UKNewsagents, women\u0027s clothes shops and estate agents struggled the most.Mr Hawkins continued: These figures come as no surprise. Uncertainty over Brexit, changing shopping habits, a harsh winter and real incomes falling all explain these figures.The consumer is king and if they want to buy online then that is their call, you can\u0027t do anything about it. But you can\u0027t leave the cost base with the old high street and expect it to survive with a new entrant, the internet.It\u0027s not fair to leave the high street to pick up the rates bill when they are only picking up 75 per cent of the trade that used to be there, due to what has gone online. We say to the Government, let the consumer be king but reduce the rates bill for those left in bricks and mortar on the high street.There should also be an equivalent version of business rates for warehousing, particularly if that warehousing is used for retail fulfilment.The last rates increase in April has been the last straw for a lot of struggling retailers, because of the massive increases. The Government says it has put rates relief measures in place to help those struggling, but it has not.It has exempted shops below \u0026pound12,000 rateable value when it used to be \u0026pound6,000, but there aren\u0027t many of our members with rateable value shops of \u0026pound12,000.Those are really tiny shops - the average independent is trading with a rateable value of about \u0026pound24,000. STOCKYorkshire and the Humber, and Greater London, have suffered the greatest decline in 2017He also highlighted the minimum wage and pensions auto-enrolment.While the Government prefers everyone to earn a certain amount, they have asked employers to pick up a bigger wage bill, he said. They have also made them pick up the cost of autoenrolment into pension schemes. The trade association, which represents 150,000 independent UK retailers, has submitted a proposal to the Government with simple measures to help its members. A cut in business rates is top of the list.Mr Hawkins said: If we had a \u0026pound12,000 allowance rather than a \u0026pound12,000 cliff edge, these shops on \u0026pound24,000 would see their rates halved. And if they were tighter on charitable relief and harder on internet warehouses there would be ways of making it revenue neutral.He said the three Ps - parking, property taxes and planning permission - were vitally important. He said: Parking is number one because it is perceived to be free out of town, even though it\u0027s often not.Newsagents, women\u0027s clothes shops and estate agents struggled the mostProperty taxes, being rates and rents, have also hit the high street.And finally planning permission, because it is too tempting for local planners to say \u0027yes, we\u0027ll allow a major development because it creates 10,000 jobs\u0027, without realising they are losing 11,000 jobs in the high street.A spokesman for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said: This Government is determined to see our high streets thriving - now, and in the future.

and it went up to £7.38 from April 1, 2018.The wage increased from £5.60 to £5.90 for 18 to 20-year-olds, and from £4.05 to £4.20 for under 18s.However, apprentices were only entitled to £3.50 if they are under-19 - this increased to £3.70 from April 1, 2018.In April 2018, the minimum wage for 25-year-olds rose from £7.50 to £7.83 an hour.The national limits are legally binding.Anyone who thinks they are not getting the National Living Wage or National Minimum Wage should complain to their employer in the first instance.If this does not get anywhere, the next step is to take the complaint to HMRC who will investigate.Those who are self-employed, voluntary workers, company directors and family members who live in the home of the employer and do household chores do not qualify for either rate.There is no difference in pay for those that live in London compared to elsewhere.The only discrepancy is for people working in agriculture or horticulture.Workers already employed before October 1, 2013 are entitled to the pay set under their contract of employment.This is a voluntary scheme aiming to recognise the actual cost of living, to which 3,000 employers have signed up.Under it, the lowest rate of pay is calculated according to the cost of living in the UK based on the changing cost of a basket of groceries.The amount is set by the charity Living Wage Foundation, and accredited employers include local authorities, NHS trusts, banks, retailers, charities and construction companies.The foundations calculations put the real Living Wage at £8.75 an hour - and £10.20 in London.These rates also apply to over-18s in recognition that young people face the same living costs as everyone else.And while companies are not legally entitled to pay more than the National Living and Minimum Wages, those which have signed up to the real Living Wage scheme have pledged to pay all workers those rates.The rate is calculated every November, and accredited employers are committed to any increases.While theres no legal obligation for your employer to pay you more than the National Living Wage (£7.50 from April 1, 2017), if your company is accredited by the Living Wage Foundation you should be receiving more than that.The foundations head of partnerships Graham Griffiths said anyone concerned can use their online whistleblowing service, and any employer not adhering to the Real Living Wage faced losing its accreditation.Graham said one area where it was challenging to pay the living wage were retail and hospitality but pointed to Ikea, Aldi and Lidl, which have agreed to pay the same rate.The scheme was launched in 2001 by parents in East London, and the foundation was set up in 2011.In 2005 following a growing interest from employers, the Greater London Authority established the Living Wage Unit to calculate what the lowest pay should ideally be.In 2008 Trust for London selected the scheme as a special initiative and made a grant of more than £1million to campaign for it and set up an accreditation scheme for employers.In April 2016 it became the inspiration for the governments higher minimum wage rate, which it rebranded the National Living Wage.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They have provided support and provided a home for a child in need.It is therefore right that Government supports them in doing so. That is why today I am extending the existing support for children and families in these circumstances.Universal Credit is currently being rolled out across the country."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/nintchdbpict000402052678.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"james forsyth local elections","story":"The thinking was disastrous local election results would shock Tory MPs into realising they cannot go on like that and that they needed a new leader.But even Mrs May’s most ardent critics have now accepted that next week’s local elections are unlikely to trigger her downfall.Why? Because expectations are so low for the Tories, they are almost bound to surpass them.Mrs May’s own position is also stronger than it was in January thanks to her handling of the Salisbury attack.At the start of the local election campaign, the talk was of how the Tories were facing a wipe-out in London, how they would do well to end up holding on to even one council.But senior figures involved in the campaign now admit they should do much better than that.Conservative Campaign Headquarters’ biggest worry in London is simply being outgunned on the day.They fear Labour’s return to being a mass membership party under Jeremy Corbyn will enable them to get nearly all their voters out, while the Tories will struggle to get more than 40 per cent of their supporters to the polls.There is, though, still cautious optimism that the Tories will hold at least one of their two flagship London boroughs, Wandsworth and Westminster.Then they could claim the results were respectable for a government in mid-term.This is especially true as results outside London are expected to be quite good for the party.One former Cabinet minister loyal to Theresa May tells me: “Things outside London really aren’t bad.”The Tories are particularly hopeful of making gains in the West Midlands.It will be tempting for the Tories to declare the local elections are further proof the capital and the rest of country are diverging politically, and so their decline in London doesn’t matter much as it will be made up for elsewhere.But this would be a catastrophic mistake.Labour’s rise in London is quite remarkable.They have gone from 37 per cent of the vote in 2010 to 55 per cent in 2017.There are several reasons why the capital is turning red but one of the biggest is the decline in home ownership.Home ownership in London peaked in the 1990s and has been falling since.Homeowners became a minority in London in 2011, the first time that has been the case since Margaret Thatcher’s Right To Buy revolution in the early 1980s.On current trends, 60 per cent of Londoners will be renters in seven years’ time.It is no coincidence that this rise in renting has coincided with Labour’s surge in the capital.For one of the things that makes you most likely to vote Tory is owning your own home.Labour’s surprise success at the last election was largely down to a big increase in turnout among renters who swung heavily to Labour.Labour London offers a preview of what happens to the Tories when homeowners become a minority.If the Tories want to win elections they need to get more homes built — and fast.CABINET Brexiteers are getting increasingly frustrated.They feel that key decisions are not being taken in Cabinet, or even the Cabinet Committee tasked with managing the negotiation, but elsewhere.One senior Brexiteer complains to me that Olly Robbins, the Prime Minister’s chief Europe adviser, is, “Running around telling everyone we have to back down on pretty much everything”.This grumpiness has been exacerbated by this week’s meeting of the Brexit inner Cabinet not discussing the big issue of the moment, customs.One member of it tells me: “When people left, they all felt a greater level of frustration.”There is a sense No10 is not respecting the political process.This all ups the ante ahead of the Brexit inner Cabinet’s meeting next week.This will discuss Theresa May’s plan for a hybrid customs model which would see the UK leave the customs union but collect tariffs on the EU’s behalf.Brexiteer ministers regard this as complicated and as having no chance of being accepted by Brussels. They think persisting with it just wastes valuable time.One tells me Mrs May has been told this hybrid plan is unworkable on eight occasions but doesn’t show any signs of abandoning the idea.Part of the problem is that Mrs May remains deeply worried about whether she has the votes in the Commons to leave the customs union.No10 is extremely concerned about the customs union amendment to the trade bill, which is expected to come to a vote in June.Its hope is the hybrid model is close enough to a customs union to see off a rebellion on this issue but if the model is unworkable, as pretty much everyone thinks, it doesn’t solve anything.Mrs May would be better off making the argument that Brexit won’t mean Brexit if Britain doesn’t regain the ability to run its own trade policy and that she couldn’t continue as Prime Minister in these circumstances.CHRIS GRAYLING wants to make it a criminal offence to cheat on auto emissions tests.This law change, which will be part of Grayling’s road to zero plan to cut exhaust emissions and improve air quality, will enable the Government to prosecute car manufacturers who try to diddle the system.The law won’t apply retrospectively.But the Department for Transport hope it will help prevent a repeat of the Volkswagen scandal.OUR political class needs to remember we are NOT Americans.The question about Donald Trump isn’t whether we would have voted for him or if we think he is the right person to be President of the United States.But how we should deal with the country he leads – which is our most important security ally.No country expelled more Russian diplomats following the Salisbury attack than the United States.Mrs May should make clear that she is delighted, not embarrassed, to welcome Donald Trump to Britain on his “working visit”.Why, because a strong relationship with the United States is in this country’s national interest.French President Emmanuel Macron, on his state visit to Washington this week, didn’t hold back in either cosying up to the president, quite literally at times, or in making clear where he disagreed with him.This is a far more sensible approach than acting all embarrassed about observing the necessary diplomatic niceties.Without Trump, yesterday’s moment of history would not have happened. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It aims to force a binding Parliamentary vote on the draft deal while talks are still ongoing.Crucially, if the deal is rejected, MPs and peers would then have power to instruct ministers what action to take – even if it means stopping Brexit.Last night, angry Brexiteers accused peers of sneaky and dishonest tactics to frustrate our departure from the EU.Brexit Minister Lord Callanan said: “Labour’s flawed amendment seeks to tie our hands by inserting false deadlines and shifting the power to negotiate from government to Parliament.“It asks for meaningless votes on the deal before the deal is done. Those who want to overturn the referendum call this the ‘no Brexit’ amendment.“The Conservatives are taking the scrutinising role of Parliament seriously, to improve an essential piece of legislation.

If children leave primary school obese it is very difficult to shed and they are more likely to end up with health problems earlier, such as diabetes.”Health minister Steve Brine has already visited the Amsterdam programme and MP Andrew Selous, chair of the all-party parliamentary group on obesity, is to lead a delegation of other MPs to the city.Tam Fry, chair of the National Obesity Forum, said: “I hope Amsterdam will teach MPs that the UK has been irresponsible since the 1980s by not checking the BMI of children.So we have failed to keep on top of the fact they are putting on excess weight.”    "},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/nintchdbpict000276899927-e1524996373218.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"theresa may faces calls to sack her top brexit official over claims hes trying to obstruct departure from eu","story":"David Davis has reportedly warned the PM she could be brought down by Oliver Robbins, the civil servant in charge of negotiating Brexit.But Mrs May has hit back - with her allies going public in support of Mr Robbins.Mr Davis spoke to the PMs chief of staff Gavin Barwell last week and warned that the civil servant has seized too much control over the Brexit process, according to the Sunday Times.An ally of the Brexit Secretary said: When Prime Ministers start following the advice of unelected advisers rather than her ministers, trouble follows.Pro-Brexit pressure group Leave Means Leave added: At each stage, Robbins has presided over a bungled negotiating position on behalf of the UK, giving leverage to the EU and acquiescing to their every whim in a way no business person would do.After the campaign against Mr Robbins came to light, Chief Whip Julian Smith wrote on Twitter: @UKCivilService is helping to deliver Brexit.The quality of support/advice is world class. Attacking ind[ependent] civil servants is deeply unfair.His tweet was then shared by Mr Barwell in a show of support for Mr Robbins from the heart of Number 10.In other Brexit developments, leaked papers suggested Amber Rudd wants European citizens to get fast-track access to Britain even after we leave the EU.The Home Secretarys plan is likely to raise concerns that the Government WONT scrap freedom of movement completely after Brexit.But in a boost for Mrs May, her pro-Remain former deputy called on Tory MPs to rally round the PMs Brexit plans.Damian Green, who was sacked in December, warned that if backbenchers defy Mrs May in Parliament they risk letting Jeremy Corbyn into power.He wrote in the Mail on Sunday that undermining the PM would not just wreck our economy, but damage our whole democracy.Around a dozen pro-EU Tories have been planning to vote to keep Britain in the customs union after Brexit."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/nintchdbpict000402413386.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"matt campbell masterchef london marathon fundraising page","story":"Hundreds of runners also jogged 3.7 miles to pay tribute to Matt Campbell, who died last Sunday.The distance poignantly marks the point of Matts collapse at the 22.5mile mark of Sundays race -
