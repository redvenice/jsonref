They will then inject the virus into a human, hoping to produce an immune response against SARS-CoV-2. This virus, weakened by genetic engineering, is a type of virus called an adenovirus, the same as those which cause common colds, that has been taken from chimpanzees. If the vaccines can successfully mimic the spikes inside a person\u0027s bloodstream, and stimulate the immune system to create special antibodies to attack it, this could train the body to destroy the real coronavirus if they get infected with it in future.It was developed so rapidly by Sarah Gilbert, a professor of vaccinology, and her team because they already had a base vaccine for similar coronaviruses. The team have gone through stages of vaccine development that usually take five years in just months.   "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ef83616cfa74c7bef0c0b52b0cd16970ed753c45/0_227_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3bf38afacd12d37e3e6ae15052994ed7","title":"20 photographs of the week","story":"Black Lives Matter protests, the funeral of George Floyd and the impact of Covid-19 – the most striking photographs from around the world this week"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5504cc4b779bfc55f02e77f6ed0865ae5bf0c075/0_0_8000_4803/master/8000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f74c18027ac2cd29286817a806cab003","title":"the best food books to take you overseas while stuck at home","story":"White truffles in Italy, fried chicken in Myanmar, cold mint and cucumber soup in Ukraine … food writer Caroline Eden shares some mouthwatering books to transport youTales of faraway dining, harvests and exotic markets are particularly welcome at a time when international travel is on hold. Few roving writers were as food obsessed as Sybille Bedford. Wine swills off the page and cities are brought to life via the ingredients she tastes in Pleasures and Landscapes (Daunt), a collection of eight essays from her journeys across Europe over 30 years. In 1960s Rome she eats out every night, breathlessly listing the highlights (“white truffles grated at the table over a plate of very fine egg pasta”), “standbys” (pastry and Sicilian oranges) and things to avoid (“Chianti, dead in the glass”). Gold-standard gastronomic journeying to other lands and other eras.A well-written cookbook, peppered with recipes, impressions and historical insights can conjure up entire worlds and atmospheres, steering us from page to plate. My last trip pre-lockdown was to the Baltic states, and I have been drawing on Baltic New \u0026amp Old Recipes: Estonia, Latvia \u0026amp Lithuania by Simon Bajada (Hardie Grant) since my return. Bajada offers a recipe for chilled beetroot soup, hakklihakaste (a “deconstructed shepherd’s pie”) and artistic-sounding “potato whistles with chanterelles”.MiMi Aye’s Mandalay (Bloomsbury) opens up Burmese culture. As well as essays on subjects ranging from monosodium glutamate to serving customs, there is an entire chapter dedicated to fritters, and instructions on how to make “BFC – Burmese Fried Chicken”. The book also emphasises the importance of heirloom recipes: “An aunt of mine once foolishly disclosed her recipe for Shan tofu to her housekeeper, who then, much to my aunt’s chagrin, promptly scarpered to set up a tofu business back in her own village.”Japanese food culture, often considered intimidating by outsiders, is demystified in Hiromi Kawakami’s novel Strange Weather in Tokyo (Granta). Food plays a central role in this love story observed through the seasons, in which Tsukiko, a woman in her late 30s, embarks on a relationship with her former high school teacher, “Sensei”, connecting with each other over trays of kaki no tane rice crackers, bottles of sake and fermented soybeans.A similarly food-obsessed but very different city is Odessa, in southern Ukraine, which provides the backdrop to Ilya Kaminsky’s poetry-prose collection Dancing in Odessa (Arc). Kaminsky, who lost most of his hearing after contracting mumps aged four, is a disquieting poet who regularly employs food as imagery. In Odessa, “famous for its drunk tailors … and most of all, for its stuffed and baked fish”, tomatoes fill coat pockets and wild garlic lingers on the breath. In “Musica Humana”, a kind of elegy to the poet Osip Mandelstam, there is a complete recipe for cold mint and cucumber soup.Recipes are threaded through Emily Nunn’s addictive and hopeful book The Comfort Food Diaries (Atria), my lockdown culinary memoir of choice. It begins with Nunn, heartbroken following a breakup, and laid off from the Chicago Tribune, embarking on a trip across America to seek out friendship and comfort food, with a little help from her hosts, whose names often feature in recipe titles, such as “Toni’s Onion Rings” or “Aunt Mariah’s Pot Roast”. Anyone who is unschooled in regional US food will find the flavours and dishes – think scrapple (pork, cornmeal, herbs) and ham biscuits – are fascinating.

How will the public respond?London to Glasgow is a small hop for an Airbus A320 jet. But it will be a significant leap out of lockdown for easyJet when its first scheduled flight since late March takes to the skies at 7am on Monday.No passenger has climbed into its orange-and-white planes since 11 weeks ago, when the airline shut down operations after flying its last holidaymakers from Tenerife back to Gatwick. At dizzying speed, European airlines have seen a virus whose risks had seemed distant and marginal put their entire existence in doubt.Revenues have dried up, thousands of staff have been furloughed or given notice of redundancy, and airport terminals have been closed or left eerily empty, while airlines sought emergency loans to survive.Now, even though Covid-19 is in retreat (at best), airlines are praying for business to return. Some have kept flying a few routes throughout the restrictions, but this week will see a first, small ramp-up of services, among which easyJet’s resurrection is the most significant in the UK.Only 10 aircraft of its fleet of more than 300 will be in service on Monday, operating domestic flights between airports including Bristol, Liverpool, Belfast and Newcastle, as well as services within continental Europe around Switzerland, France, Italy and Portugal. A total of 310 flights are scheduled this week.British Airways – the flag carrier now branded a “national disgrace” by MPs for its plans to cut jobs and alter conditions – had announced its intention to restart flying in earnest from July. Now it says schedules will remain under review because of the quarantine rules instigated last week, which outraged airlines just as they were making plans to “save summer”.The row still rages. The three biggest UK carriers, easyJet, BA and Ryanair, have launched legal action to tackle what BA’s owner, IAG, has labelled the “irrational and disproportionate” rules that make passengers flying into the UK self-isolate for 14 days. As tourism and travel bosses have emphasised, the restrictions effectively kill any possible leisure travel, inbound or outbound.Another spat has blown up about the safety of hand luggage, after the government published its advice – drawn up with the industry – on what safe air travel might look like. Ryanair swiftly described it as nonsense.In any event, life on board will be, for now, very different. Face coverings are to become mandatory on planes and advisory throughout the airports, as on all UK public transport from Monday.Trolley service is to be scrapped or reduced, distancing enforced where possible, toilet visits discouraged, and enough reminders plastered around to wash hands and not touch anything as to make the hardiest traveller a nervous germophobe. While most will welcome the focus on safety, the experience is likely to become – more than ever – an endurance test rather than a pleasure.Captain David Morgan, easyJet’s director of flight operations, who will take the first flight out of Gatwick, acknowledges the changes could be a shock to some. “We’ll have … enhanced aircraft disinfection, customers and crew will be required to wear masks on board, and initially we won’t serve any food or drinks.” The measures will he says, remain for as long as is needed while coronavirus remains a threat – certainly, most would assume, the next few months. It’s probably bearable for necessary travel, but hardly enticing for leisure.Morgan concedes that “the airport environment could feel a little different for younger travellers when flying over the summer holidays”. If few parents can ever have happily contemplated the airport stage of a family trip, the lurking threat of a deadly virus may push the dread too far, even despite easyJet’s efforts to ease the pain by issuing comic face mask covers (for kids).And yet, according to the initial experience of airlines abroad, passengers appear ready to fly. John Strickland, a consultant, points to France and Turkey, where internal flights have restarted. “The domestic market looks quite buoyant … destinations are opening up and there has been a spike in travel and searches,” he says. “As soon as the straitjacket is taken off by government, people seem to be booking travel.”Aviation bodies have seized on the European commission’s calls to lift all intra-EU travel restrictions from Monday to stress that passengers can fly safely. The International Air Transport Association has claimed that enhanced biosafety measures make “airport and aircraft environments exceptionally sanitised and controlled public spaces”. Patrick Ky, the executive director of the EU air safety agency, Easa, said: “We are confident that, providing iniduals behave responsibly and abide by the measures being put in place by airports and airlines, passengers can return to the skies with confidence.”But while the cooped-up population may be emboldened to take a quick break in Portugal, a rally for the long-haul travel that once filled BA’s coffers looks further off. “Recovery on long haul will be years out – and business travel will be reduced significantly,” says Strickland."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3e47e280deecab03c0a2159593473257a62e0f41/0_198_6000_3604/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=42619e23d79a23a70011c11f8b380b67","title":"john lewis sets out its stores for post lockdown shopping world","story":"Retailer hopes new shopping etiquette such as disposable socks for trying on shoes will tempt customers backIt is John Lewis but not as you know it. The department store chain has given its stores a coronavirus makeover and customers will next week find new shopping rules apply – including not trying on clothes and escalator etiquette involving an eight-step gap.The employee-owned retailer, along with other big high-street names such as Marks \u0026amp Spencer and Primark, will enter a brave new world on Monday when the relaxation of government restrictions in England provides the first real glimpse of shopper appetite to return to the high street proper. Department stores, bookshops, electrical outlets and toy retailers will be among the businesses opening when non-essential shops welcome back customers after an enforced three-month shutdown.Bérangère Michel, who oversees customer service at the John Lewis Partnership, which owns the John Lewis stores and the Waitrose supermarket business, says it has taken a month to get its store in Kingston upon Thames, south-west London – one of two opening on Monday, the other is Poole, Dorset – safe for the public to shop in. “It’s a complex thing to open a department store – and we know what it takes to run a socially distanced store because we have been running Waitrose for 12 weeks,” she explains.The store spread over three floors looks subtly different. The brightly lit atrium still smells of the expensive scented candles on display but the shop floor is punctuated with reminders of the health crisis, from the stickers on the ground to signs by the escalators advising shoppers to “keep eight steps between you and the next customer”. Initially only 270 shoppers will be allowed into the cavernous store at once – less than half of the store’s usual capacity.There are other changes too. If you are in the market to buy a new sofa or bed you will have to use a disposable hygiene cover before making yourself comfortable. Similarly if a pair of shoes catches your eye, you will need to wait for a spot on the socially distanced banquettes and wear disposable popsocks before trying them on.“Customers will need to need to get used to some of the new ways of shopping,” advises Michel, who says customers are encouraged to use the hand sanitiser dotted around its store every 20 minutes if they want to touch things safely. “We aren’t encouraging customers to try on fashion: if you want to buy a dress and don’t know if you are a size 12 or 14, then buy both and return one if you need to.”After missing out on 12 weeks of trading, including a glorious sun-soaked May – which would have meant a rush on summer dresses, shorts and sandals – next week’s reprieve is thin gruel for department stores and fashion retailers which are the backbone of our shopping centres.Richard Lim, who runs the consultancy firm Retail Economics, said: “The big thing is no one really knows how consumers are going to react. I think they will continue to prioritise spending on the things they need, but they are also desperate to get out so … there might be an initial bump in footfall.”The other issue, Lim suggests, is whether consumer expectations of the high street will marry up with the reality as queues, one-way systems and physical distancing wardens threaten to squeeze the fun out of shopping – potentially sending them back online. “There might just be a gap between what people expect and what it actually is like,” he says.Michel says customers have been writing to her asking when their local John Lewis will reopen and is optimistic that there will be a section of the public eager to shop for pleasure again. “I think people just want a normal life,” she says. “However, we are also conscious that some of our customers either might not feel safe or still are not allowed to leave their home yet.”With countries emerging from lockdown at different speeds and no clear pattern of recovery emerging, retailers are taking a step into the unknown. But Michel adds: “You can only control what you can control. This is a reawakening of the high street and British communities and isn’t just about shopping.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/78ab98438a8349f5293129f954b8c92b18a22e5e/2_0_1220_732/master/1220.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=07e0d8bfbb9b1c13512e7270d0e29729","title":"blacking up was of a piece with comedy that dealt in contempt","story":"Little Britain, removed from BBC streaming services, anticipated a coming vindictivenessOf all the arguments the history of slavery and racism has provoked, the spats about the comedy shows of the 2000s appear the least significant. Given the severity of the crisis that is upon us, surely it’s a distraction to worry away about the decision by the BBC and Netflix to pull Little Britain because its “stars” blacked up. Yet as we enter a global depression that the World Bank predicts will push 100 million people into extreme poverty, as unemployment in our corner of the globe heads towards 4 million, as food banks creak and charities collapse, the petty censorship raises a question of the utmost urgency: how will western societies respond to mass poverty?After the crash of 2008, they punished the victims. Britain under David Cameron and Nick Clegg slashed benefits, targeting children who had shown their unworthiness when they failed to find rich parents who could raise them in comfort. The northern states of the EU justified leaving Spaniards, Italians and Greeks to suffer by characterising them as lazy southerners who had to learn that “hard work comes before the siesta”.Even third-rate art can anticipate the future. In Little Britain and shows like it, you could sense the coming vindictiveness. They weren’t encouraging racial hatred but class hatred. What was meant to titillate viewers about Desiree DeVere, played by David Walliams with blackface and a fat suit, wasn’t just that she was black, but that she was obese and as common as muck.The idea that this grotesque figure thought herself a beauty was laughable. Another character pretended to be disabled to get sympathy, but jumped out of his wheelchair when no one was looking. A third ran a fat-fighters group while showing no awareness of how ugly her own greed was. After years of a Labour government redistributing wealth, television was reflecting the belief of millions that their money was going to scroungers, who faked disabilities and grabbed benefits so they could buy junk food and stuff it into their foul, fat faces.Critics said as much at the time, thus passing a test that everyone caught up in our culture wars ought to set themselves. The cry from the right that “we’re judging the past by the standards of the present” can be as historically illiterate as the cry from the left that Britain’s history is irredeemably racist. Contemporaries we can admire and learn from contested the East India Company, slavery and empire. And in its small way the punitive turn in comedy of the 2000s was contested as it happened too.“Whereas wealthy media executives once sought to investigate poverty or arouse anger against it in documentaries and dramas such as Cathy Come Home or Boys from the Blackstuff,” I wrote in 2008, “now they commission programmes that laugh at it.”That’s not to excuse today’s censorship. Comedians, like everyone else, have the right to punch up, punch down or punch themselves in the face (an option a few of them should exercise more often). Broadcasters are hiding an uncomfortable truth about Britain as they purge their archives. They and the “talent” they commissioned didn’t mock the grasping poor because they were lying to viewers – there are benefits cheats, after all, and, from Falstaff on, the fit have always found the fat risible. Nor were they trying to brainwash the audience with rightwing propaganda. The broadcasters of the day were merely operating in the entertainment market and giving a large section of the audience what it wanted. The BBC and Netflix now think that expunging the past will please the market of the 2020s. Puritans are only happy when someone is being silenced and doubtless they will be pleased. I suspect serious people will not be as happy. They will understand that the censorship of light entertainment trivialises their cause and allows their opponents to paint them as enemies of freedom.The worst of it is that we ought to be thinking about why the response to the 2008 crash turned into a catastrophe. Sweetening history, tidying it up as if broadcasters are schoolteachers and we are vulnerable children, is not only repellent in itself, it stops us understanding the folly that led to a disaster.Any account of what needs to be done to avoid the destitution of large parts of society must begin with confronting the prejudice that poverty is the fault of the undeserving poor. The young need to go to and stay in universities and further education colleges until the storm passes or find work on local authority job creation schemes. Higher education and councils will need to be seen as deserving of public money, if they are to help them. The Resolution Foundation and other leftish thinktanks are telling the government that the private sector on its own will not be able to revive the economy fast enough. They are proposing that the state should bail out depressed regions in their entirety and that the emergency increases in universal credit benefits, introduced in April, should become permanent. Readers who believe the Tories are evil disaster capitalists will be surprised to hear that they are getting a fair hearing, although whether this government has the competence to act on what ministers are hearing is another matter. Meanwhile, readers who believe the electorate will not cheer on a government if it turns on the victims forget the lessons of the recent past and the unshakable prejudices the 2000s displayed.In Europe, recessions have been mean times. Voters have elected leaders who have held the poor responsible for their poverty and encouraged the hatred of foreigners for stealing jobs and sponging off welfare states. I don’t think it will happen this time, but I won’t pretend to be certain. If the idea of blaming a slump caused by a virus on its victims sounds absurd, it was equally absurd to blame a slump caused by the financial system on benefit claimants.

These must be acknowledgedMartin Luther King Jr once said: “The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice.” So, too, we are told that discriminatory ignorance resides with the older generation and that the next will usher forth a more inclusive world. Sadly, as an educator, I know that this isn’t the case. Increasingly, young people, perhaps disenfranchised by broader social inequality, are rejecting multiculturalism and aligning themselves with racist views.\u0026nbspEducation will always remain a key instrument for disarming ignorance and bigotry. Both the 1999 Macpherson report, published in the wake of the racially motivated murder of Stephen Lawrence, and the 2020 Windrush Lessons Learned review strongly recommended that black history occupy a more integral role in school syllabuses. Sadly, 20 years on from the Macpherson report there have been no significant advancements.British history within our education system remains filtered by a deliberate amnesia – the country’s persecution of black people in pursuit of the empire is largely omitted and black history is erased. The abolition of slavery is taught in some secondary schools, but not the UK’s role in profiting from the transatlantic slave trade and its atrocities against citizens of colonised lands, such as the crushing of the Mau Mau uprising in Kenya. Furthermore, the positive contribution of black people is largely ignored, presenting them as oppressed subjects, rather than agents of change contributing to the development of modern Britain. British history of events such as the second world war centres the white British experience, and this implicit hierarchy determines what narratives and bodies of knowledge come to be seen as “authentically” British. The proliferation of discourses saturated in nostalgia and nationalism have been a central tenet in the mobilisation of today’s hostile environments.The residual effects of that persecution and erasure are still keenly felt today by black communities who consistently encounter institutional racism in all its insidious manifestations, for example the disproportionate use of stop-and-search powers and deportation.\u0026nbspThe distorted and historically inaccurate version of British history fails to equip British people with the knowledge to understand this racism, and contributes to a rhetoric that has an impact on the potential for social harmony in a society composed of different nationalities and heritages. If the teaching of feminist history is consigned to the largely white suffragette movement, the contributions of black feminists such as Olive Morris are omitted. If children learned about these contributions they might better understand intersectionality, and be vigilant toward present-day manifestations of misogynoir such as Diane Abbott’s treatment on social media during the 2017 election.\u0026nbspThe absence of a erse curriculum that reflects black history invariably has an adverse affect on the attainment outcomes of young black people. Black students are unable to learn about their own history within a British and global context. \u0026nbspCrucial educational interventions such as the Black Curriculum have been integral to ensuring that the issue of black history occupies the political centre rather than residing on the margins as has historically been the case. The project, launched by Lavinya Stennett in January 2019, attempts to reimagine the future of education through black British history by providing arts-focused black history programmes and teacher training focusing on influential black figures throughout history.But mobilising this agenda cannot remain the sole responsibility of anti-racist activists. Centralised government support is required in implementing change. The much needed reconceptualisation of British history requires a dismantling of the existing system. An inclusive curriculum that embraces black history first and foremost must decentre whiteness and the Eurocentric canon. It means telling the story of the British empire, warts and all, and adding the contributions of migrants to the postwar rebuilding effort to the story we tell about our nation’s past. The onus must not solely be placed upon schools already facing severe budget cuts as a result of austerity and the Covid-19 pandemic. Teachers must also be professionally supported to engage with black historical content and deliver these syllabuses accurately and correctly.\u0026nbspThe promise of a more erse and inclusive curriculum is paramount in resolving strained national and global social relations. Our past and present history informs our sense of belonging and socialisation. The acknowledgement of black communities in shaping this narrative is essential in truly reflecting a multicultural British society.\u0026nbsp• Dr Jason Arday is an assistant professor of sociology at Durham University\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2a346f97d05e9264ab562a72045522d0d2fe6454/626_487_4335_2601/master/4335.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=63a132b432ebece5c095be6756b69f29","title":"small businesses social distancing covid 19","story":"We’ve done everything to keep our small Hereford bar afloat – but now we need to fill it with customersMy husband and I run a quirky, colourful music bar in Hereford. The past four months have been been traumatic, as they have for many who run small businesses up and down the country.\u0026nbspWhile many are already talking of the “post-Covid-19” economy, that feels like a far-off prospect when we seem to be treading a path through a Covid-19 labyrinth.We bought the lease of a building and opened Babar Cafe in November 2018.\u0026nbspWe had run a London pub many years ago and, while we both moved into other jobs, we continued to put on club nights. One of those became a success, and a dormant seed germinated as we kept one eye open for a venue. The right building came on the market at the same time as we were selling a flat we had done up.Times had changed since the late 1990s – and running a small business presented many challenges. The first year was such hard work, but\u0026nbspwe soon had supportive and passionate customers. With the help of local promoters we put on bands and a wonderful array of DJs: on weekend nights , the place was filled with dancing, and there was love and hugs everywhere.Even though we were busy, the cost of running a small business is high – and the hardest challenge\u0026nbsp was making a profit. We had just got on top of this when Covid-19 skulked into view. On 12 March, we became so panicked about potentially spreading and catching the virus that we closed our doors.Following closure, we cut outgoings by sending in meter readings to forestall estimated electric bills, stopping rubbish collections – and anything else we could think of. We called our insurance company, who refused both a claim for business interruption and to reduce our premium while we were closed.We contacted our landlord and, after months of negotiation, he agreed to reduce our rent to half until social distancing is no longer required, or to the end of April 2021. This has been the difference between us wanting to throw in the towel and finding the will to keep going.\u0026nbspFinancial help from the government has also worked out well. We received the £10,000 grant from our local authority as part of the small business scheme\u0026nbspannounced by the chancellor shortly before lockdown. The application was easy to access online, where HMRC and Companies House already hold facts and figures. That enabled us to clear outstanding debts, including for wasting kegs, and provide a brief buffer. I furloughed staff, including my husband, whom we paid a low PAYE wage. I had not yet drawn a wage from the business but was furloughed from an additional part-time job.Throughout lockdown, the thought of how the future will play out for our bar has been causing me real stress.\u0026nbspI have felt defeated one day and warrior-like the next but the reality is that social distancing is a nightmare for small venues because with the number of customers we’ll be allowed to take in, it’ll cost more to keep the place open than we could possibly turn over.When our licensing authority gives us the go-ahead, we plan to initially open for bubble-group bookings only. That means private zones (front or back, each of which have their own entrance) for guests to have a day or night out with their social group and little risk of stranger contact. Social distancing within groups is still required, so there are issues to contend with – but the idea is that people can socialise within a shielded environment.If there are not enough bookings to provide us with an income or meet venue costs, we will be up the creek. With that in mind, we are preparing to stay above the bar – and ready our little house across the border in south Wales for holiday rental. We hope the allure of a whole house near a mountaintop will help see us through to the end of social distancing. However, that cannot happen until Wales opens its borders to visitors. Today, on the road from Hereford, the graffitied addendum to the Wales sign says\u0026nbsp“Sorry we’re closed”.Without certainty in any direction – being furloughed provides an interlude where wages are paid, but with no future guarantee – it is a confusing time. Focus shifts daily, with our priorities constantly evolving. While others struggle with isolation-based mental health issues, our minds are bombarded with thoughts of how to make this work. A small bar might not seem like the most important of priorities right now, but it is independent venues, shops and storefronts like ours that give life to towns and cities. Nights to remember, evenings out with friends – where the worries of the day can melt away.

Then Tomsett tuned into the prime minister’s press conference on Wednesday and heard the government’s chief scientific adviser suggest that the 2-metre diktat was “not a scientific rule” and had never been official advice.“The moment we are ready to welcome back year 10, the government openly discusses the fact that 2-metres is optional and is probably going to go down to 1,” said Tomsett. “It’s the same way they have been gaslighting us with Dominic Cummings.”He remains incensed the prime minister’s closest adviser got away with bending the rules to drive 500 miles to Durham in case he needed childcare.“My mother died of Covid during the pandemic in April and I drove 500 miles to Sussex for her funeral, there and back in a day. My sister lives a mile away from where we buried her but I didn’t stay over because I didn’t want to break the rules.”Until this week, the government had insisted that all primary school children in England would go back for a month before the summer holidays. Then, in a  statement to the House of Commons on Tuesday, the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, conceded defeat. Now, he said, “we will be working to bring all children back to school in September”. It was just the latest screeching U-turn from an education department that effectively left schools to fend for themselves, and has moved the goalposts so many times over the past 12 weeks that teachers and parents are finding it hard to remember how this interminable guessing game began.That was on 18 March, when Boris Johnson announced all schools in England were to close indefinitely, following similar announcements in Scotland and Wales.Until June, only the most vulnerable children and the offspring of key workers were allowed to go to school, with everyone else muddling along at home.Ashley Parry is headteacher of two small primary schools in High Peak, Derbyshire: Thornsett, which has 85 pupils, and New Town, with 73. “Probably the most difficult thing throughout this has been the constant guidance changes,” he said. “I sent a newsletter out to parents at the end of last month and at that point there had been 150 guidance changes. I think it’s 180-something now. It’s just constant.”The situation in Scotland and Northern Ireland has been clearer, with the devolved administrations deciding earlier on that children were not returning this school year. In Wales, the guidance is that all children will return on 29 June. But until this week, English schools had been in limbo.Parry’s schools had been looking after key worker and vulnerable children for more than two months before government decided to tell schools to keep children 2 metres apart, he said: “They’ve been washing hands lots and being sensible, but they are primary school kids. We weren’t able to adhere to the 2-metre rule.”There are only three classrooms at Thornsett, which is perched on a hillside above the town of New Mills. They are already at capacity, with 29 pupils back from reception, year 1 and year 6, split into three “bubbles” that don’t mix. It was never feasible to have all the children back and abide by physical-distancing rules, said Parry.The government has failed to understand how difficult it can be getting vulnerable children into school at the best of times, she said.“The relationship between disadvantaged families and school is complex. Often they are families who struggle to engage with school when things are typical. There needs to be an acknowledgment that getting children back to school is not just about having the space but also having the conversation, the hearts and minds part.”The vast majority of children and many staff at St Mary’s are black or from another ethic minority, a group known to be at higher risk of dying from Covid-19. “There is an added anxiety for them. Parents are anxious. We’ve had a lot of doorstep visits, a lot of phone calls but parents still aren’t completely convinced that school is safe before September so we have very low numbers,” said McGarry.St Mary’s reopened to year 6 on Monday but only five pupils showed up. McGarry has a few theories why. “Some of our families are quite big and they might only be sending one child back and have the rest at home, so it doesn’t make life easier. Also, if you look at our level of free school meals, our levels of unemployment are incredibly high, so that pressure to get back to work is probably felt a little bit less than schools in more affluent areas,” she said. It had not gone unnoticed that the government said parents would not be fined for keeping children at home, she added: “But we are trying to whip up interest on a daily basis.”A month into lockdown, the government announced a scheme to give laptops to all vulnerable and disadvantaged children. But the criteria was so strict that only three of St Mary’s students qualified. They are still waiting for the laptops.In the meantime, the school bought laptops and iPads for about 15 other families, sometimes showing parents how to set up email addresses for the first time.“You have other families where the mum is using data on her phone and perhaps four kids all trying to access remote learning,” said McGarry. A less centralised approach would have been better, she said: “If we have been given the funding ourselves we could have gone out and bought equipment right at the start for those who needed it.”In Sunderland, which has one of the highest number of Covid-19 cases in England (499 per 100,000 people, compared with the English average of 279), staff at Our Lady Queen of Peace Catholic primary school in Penshaw, Houghton-le-Spring, have been working non-stop since February half-term, throughout the Easter holidays and taking just one Bank Holiday Monday off. “We have been particularly lucky and blessed that staff were fit and able to keep working,” said the headteacher, Barbara Reilly-O’Donnell.Epidemics of infectious diseases behave in different ways but the\u0026nbsp1918 influenza pandemic\u0026nbspthat killed more than 50 million people is regarded as a key example of a pandemic that occurred in multiple waves, with the latter more severe than the first. It has been replicated – albeit more mildly – in subsequent flu pandemics.How and why multiple-wave outbreaks occur, and how subsequent waves of infection can be prevented, has become a staple of epidemiological modelling studies and pandemic preparation, which have looked at everything from social behaviour and health policy to vaccination and the buildup of community immunity, also known as herd immunity.This is being watched very carefully. Without a vaccine, and with no widespread immunity to the new disease, one alarm is being sounded by the experience of Singapore, which has seen a sudden\u0026nbspresurgence in infections\u0026nbspdespite being lauded for its early handling of the outbreak.Although Singapore instituted a strong contact tracing system for its general population, the disease re-emerged in\u0026nbspcramped dormitory accommodation\u0026nbspused by thousands of foreign workers with inadequate hygiene facilities and shared canteens.Singapore’s experience, although very specific, has demonstrated the ability of the disease to come back strongly in places where people are in close proximity and its ability to exploit any weakness in public health regimes set up to counter it.Conventional wisdom among scientists suggests second waves of resistant infections occur after the capacity for treatment and isolation becomes exhausted. In this case the concern is that the social and political consensus supporting lockdowns is being overtaken by public frustration and the urgent need to reopen economies.The threat declines when susceptibility of the population to the disease falls below a certain threshold or when widespread vaccination becomes available.In general terms the ratio of susceptible and immune iniduals in a population at the end of one wave determines the potential magnitude of a subsequent wave. The worry right now is that with\u0026nbspa vaccine still months away, and the real rate of infection only being guessed at, populations worldwide remain highly vulnerable to both resurgence and subsequent waves.Staff have pulled out all the stops to try to reassure the children, she said. Some have filmed themselves reading stories and put them on YouTube: “It’s nice for the children to see a familiar face, to give them some certainty that not everything has changed in their life.”Like all the headteachers interviewed for this story, Reilly-O’Donnell was taken aback to hear Boris Johnson announce this week “a big summer of catchup” for pupils who have missed months of lessons in the lockdown. “Do I want all children to catch up? Well of course I do,” she said. “But we have to explore lots of different avenues how to do that … I’m disappointed we haven’t yet had the opportunity to explore what that might look like and the quality of that provision.”In High Peak, Parry is categorical his staff will not be working at a summer school, as they are on the verge of burnout after trying to balance the expectations of “parents who expect three Zooms a day and others who just want to be left alone”, he said. “Staff are exhausted. It’s just a non-starter.”In York, Tomsett does not think schools will be back to normal in September. “I’m planning for three scenarios: a spike happens and we are completely closed, we’re completely open or it’s 50-50. If it goes down to 1 metre we can get half the school back.” Under 2-metre rules they can only fit eight pupils into a classroom that normally seats 30.He pooh-poohed the suggestion that village halls could be co-opted into “Nightingale schools” providing spillover classrooms.“If you’ve got coronavirus and you are in hospital, you are either unconscious or unbelievably compliant and just want people to help you. You don’t care if it’s in some warehouse. If you’re a year 10, in a town hall being taught by someone you’ve never met, the situation is completely different.”He, too, questioned how these pop-up schools would be staffed. While the NHS seemed to have little trouble coaxing doctors out of retirement, the same may well not be true for teachers, he added: “Lots of teachers have gone into retirement for very good reason: because they never want to teach again. It’s completely different. I just don’t understand the government’s thinking.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7cfbd3fdde04f45959adfd711a923f28aa2b74cc/0_386_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ac72ed00436677d8ef2539d169466a37","title":"its all i talk about crunch time for sixth formers to decide on university places","story":"School leavers tell of the stress of having to make important decisions while coronavirus throws UK education into disarrayThe final year of school is always stressful but at least it follows a familiar template: revision, exams, results, and – hopefully – celebrations. For this year’s A-level students, however, everything they hoped for has been turned on its head by the coronavirus pandemic.Sixth-formers now have to make important decisions based on uncertain information: will their teacher-assessed grades be lower? Will they still get their place at university? Will they need to take exams in the autumn? When will they even know? They need to decide on their first choice of university by 18 June, although some universities will still consider applications after that to defer for a year.“I was in hospital at the start of the year for eight days, and I was off school for more than a month. If there’s been any disruption to your education they usually give you extra marks in your A-levels but now I have no idea what to expect. I am worried I won’t get my grades through teacher marks, so I was thinking I would take the option of sitting exams in the autumn term. But the government hasn’t said when. If it’s in September, maybe people would be able to do the exams and still go to university, but if it’s November then term will already have started. I was hoping to go to Nottingham University in September to do economics.You look forward to university, and to suddenly not have a clue whether or not you’re going and the next steps for what you want to do is frustrating. And it’s hard to prepare for exams when you don’t even know when they are or how they’re going to work. I’d rather take a year out to get the grades I need rather than just settle for less.If I do get my grades, I will still go to university – but I’m worried now whether it will be what I’d hoped for. Part of it is making friends, trying new activities, getting the first experience of living away from home, kind of like a taste of adulthood. If you’re doing university online that’s not the same.”“I was planning to study Arabic and business at Edinburgh University starting this year. But the coronavirus situation has given me time to think about whether the decision is right for me.\u0026nbspI’m pretty sure I’m going to do a gap year now. I don’t want to start university with online teaching. I think for learning a new language from scratch, having face-to-face teaching is important. Another big factor is the social side, because Scotland is the opposite end of the country from where I am now. If you’re unable to go out and mix that causes isolation and you just feel a bit lonely, which isn’t how you want to feel when you’re embarking on a new adventure.\u0026nbspSo do I reject my offer? Or do I defer? What most stresses me is all the uncertainty.\u0026nbspI don’t even know whether that’s still the course I want to do – I’m thinking of studying international relations now.I’m trying to find a job, which is tricky because so is the rest of the world. If I worked and built up some money I’d like to visit the Middle East in my gap year, but I don’t know how travel restrictions will pan out. My parents have been very understanding. It’s all I ever seem to talk about: school and uni and how everything’s going to pan out. It’s always at the forefront of my mind. I’m just trying to get everything off my chest and trying to understand more clearly what I want to do.”“The course I’ve applied for, applied chemistry and chemical engineering at the University of Strathclyde, is the only one in the country. I wouldn’t change my decision because the course is exactly right for me, and I think if that’s the case you’ll be able to get through whatever adversities are put in your way. Yes, people are saying social distancing could go on for years, but it’s pointless worrying about two to three years into the future. The course is fantastic and if I have to wear a mask, I have to wear a mask.I would feel quite disappointed if it was entirely online. In the first year there’s a great deal of social interaction outside the course. It’s also difficult to teach practical subjects like chemistry online – you can’t expect people to set up labs in their bedrooms or there’d be a lot of university students missing eyebrows.What we have to remember is: everyone’s in the same boat. Everyone won’t have had a freshers week, won’t have met new people. But it’ll just be delayed. Where that starts to change is if the entire first year is online. Then you’ll be more likely to make friends on your course rather than people who you live with, so you won’t have as erse a friendship circle.Teachers say if you get the grades just go to the university, don’t worry about taking the exams, which is sound advice. Some teachers say you might want to keep your hand in, in terms of revision for autumn exams in case you don’t get what you want. I slightly disagree, because if you try to revise all that time you’re going to burn out.”“To pass the time in lockdown I started looking into different history subjects, which has made me question whether in applying for computer science, I applied for the right degree. I studied the Golden Age of Spain for my coursework, but my A-level curriculum skipped\u0026nbspmultiple events and characters, such as Queen Juana “the Mad” of Castile, who I found really interesting. I really enjoyed delving into a more detailed version of the past and that’s led me to reconsider my degree.\u0026nbspI enjoy the discussion side of history and that there’s no right answer, whereas computer science can be very black and white.\u0026nbspThe university I applied to was in Scotland, and I’m now looking at other universities, including Oxbridge, to study history. I’m scared of losing the place I already have, though, as I know the competition will be tougher next year. I’m waiting to get my grades to make a final choice – whether to defer or go through clearing.\u0026nbspIf I defer, I’ll spend a year continuing to look into history and who I want to be, now I don’t have to worry about exams. It has been sad that all the final events I was going to have with my friends have been taken away, but as the world has been going more online we’ve found new ways of reaching out to each other. So although it has taken some of the expectations of leaving school I had, it’s given me a sense of community I didn’t have before.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db17b9c18ececa286323e91dea11c01e524fbe48/0_321_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=254317fd9714d935fd7fee8a1b5209bb","title":"uk language students prepare for virtual year abroad in their bedrooms","story":"Some universities have cancelled overseas trips amid coronavirus fears and others are trying to think of alternatives What is a virtual year abroad – and is there any point in it? That is the question Reece Jack, of Troon, South Ayrshire, is asking, along with thousands of other languages students whose year abroad has been cancelled or is in doubt.Jack, a second-year student of business and French at Strathclyde University, thinks the idea of shared “virtual year abroad” resources across universities, being offered as a partial replacement for the real experience, is “delusional”. “Students will not pick up a natural fluency staying in the UK – the most anti-learning-a-language country there is,” he says.His plans to start university in Dijon in September, for him the highlight of his course, have been thrown into doubt. With no guarantee this can happen, he is considering suspending his degree for a year.“It is a huge frustration,” he says. “A lot of us chose to study a language because of the year abroad.”The third year spent overseas doing courses or working is famously the time when language students become fluent. It makes them more likely to gain a decent degree and then a job, and it is sold as a life-changing experience. But second-year students across the country are realising they may now have to try to immerse themselves in a new culture from a laptop in their bedroom.Some universities, including Edinburgh and Newcastle, have confirmed they are cancelling all plans for a year abroad in the first semester because of the uncertainty. Many students starting their third year in September are still waiting to find out if they can leave for teaching assistant jobs, work placements, or university courses overseas this year. With the coronavirus placing a question mark over where and when students can travel safely, universities are scrambling to come up with options.Some students are asking to defer their course for a year so they can have a year abroad alongside the following year’s cohort, leaving universities with the prospect of overloaded final-year courses when they return.Jack worries that skipping his year abroad will set him and his coursemates back in what is likely to be a fiercely competitive jobs market. “I’m thinking that there will be students ahead of me and behind me who will be graduating with better language skills. I think companies would prefer someone who has spent a proper chunk of time abroad.”At Edinburgh University, more than 200 students and parents have signed a petition to demand the university explain why it has cancelled semester placements starting in September in countries already easing their lockdowns. The petition says: “With many European countries starting to make plans to welcome tourists to their shores from the start of next month, it is clearly far too early to reach such a compromising decision”.Toby Gay, a second-year Spanish and linguistics student at Edinburgh, who organised the petition, says: “The teachers have done a great job, but quite frankly the year abroad is when you learn the language. Our degree results are dependent on it and so are our future prospects.”He adds: “I’ve spoken to a lot of students and they are frustrated about the lack of communication. It is all a mess and no one knows what is going on.”A spokesperson for Edinburgh said it made the “difficult decision” to cancel overseas placements in semester one “due to ongoing global restrictions and to protect the health and safety of our students”.Academics feel sad for their students. Prof Adam Watt, head of the department of modern languages and cultures at Exeter University, says: “The year abroad is a relatively small part of what counts towards your degree. But in experiential life terms, it is huge.”But Watt understands what is at stake for universities, who are tasked with keeping their students safe. He spent the beginning of the year bringing back around 200 students from abroad, some from areas such as China and northern Italy. Many didn’t want to come home but the university had to insist, he says.Unlike Edinburgh, Exeter has not cancelled semester one placements, which remain up in the air. Watt says it could be that students set off for different countries at different times. “If government guidance is that travel is OK, and the student and the host institution are both OK, that would get our blessing,” he says.In the meantime, Exeter will use the pool of “virtual year abroad” resources being co-ordinated by the University Council of Modern Languages (UCML), and will shoehorn extra language classes into students’ schedules. Partner universities abroad are offering online courses, and some work placements are going ahead online, where employees may be working from home.“I’ve had to be honest with students and say that none of the options are particularly desirable,” Watt says. “We can’t replace that life experience, but we can put in place activities that will develop you as linguists and thinkers who are ready for your final year.”Like many other universities, Exeter has said language students can skip their year abroad altogether and go straight to their final year, but Watt says packing four years of language learning into three \u0026nbspwill be an incredibly hard option.Currently only a few of his students are asking about deferring. He suspects more have “chewed it over” and realised they might struggle to get a job and be unable to travel.Meanwhile, at Newcastle University Prof Richard Davies, global pro vice chancellor, says his university has decided “with a very heavy heart” to cancel all years abroad chosen by students as an optional add-on, rather than a mandatory part of a language degree.The university has also cancelled all September travel for its language students, but hopes to send them off in the new year. “One possibility we’ve discussed is that we might need to go through each country inidually to assess the risk,” he says.Claire Gorrara, chair of the UCML and professor of French at Cardiff University, says the council’s 100 university members “want to get as many students to their host country as they can”, but students will have to accept some uncertainty. She says students shouldn’t regard having “an immersive experience” on their laptop in the UK for some of the year as a “worst-case scenario”.However, many students remain unconvinced. Isabella Ponsonby, 20, from Nottingham, who is studying history with politics and French at Newcastle University, will be going straight to her final year. She says: “I worried that if I arranged to go abroad in January it might all still fall apart and that would be so disappointing. I’ve decided it’s easier to just sack off the year abroad.”• This article was amended on 13 June 2020. An earlier version said Cambridge was one of the universities that had announced they were cancelling years abroad next semester. This was not correct."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/935c15a6be288719aee1466ca2d443248a6fb029/136_0_5705_3424/master/5705.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=04dfedb7fa7c4116072f0c2885526a01","title":"climate worst case scenarios clouds scientists global heating","story":"Modelling suggests climate is considerably more sensitive to carbon emissions than thoughtWorst-case global heating scenarios may need to be revised upwards in light of a better understanding of the role of clouds, scientists have said.Recent modelling data suggests the climate is considerably more sensitive to carbon emissions than previously believed, and experts said the projections had the potential to be “incredibly alarming”, though they stressed further research would be needed to validate the new numbers.Modelling results from more than 20 institutions are being compiled for the sixth assessment by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which is due to be released next year.“That is a very deep concern,” Johan Rockström, the director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, said. “Climate sensitivity is the holy grail of climate science. It is the prime indicator of climate risk. For 40 years, it has been around 3C. Now, we are suddenly starting to see big climate models on the best supercomputers showing things could be worse than we thought.”Worst-case projections in excess of 5C have been generated by several of the world’s leading climate research bodies, including the UK Met Office’s Hadley Centre and the EU’s Community Earth System Model.Timothy Palmer, a professor in climate physics at Oxford University and a member of the Met Office’s advisory board, said the high figure initially made scientists nervous. “It was way outside previous estimates. People asked whether there was a bug in the code,” he said. “But it boiled down to relatively small changes in the way clouds are represented in the models.”The role of clouds is one of the most uncertain areas in climate science because they are hard to measure and, depending on altitude, droplet temperature and other factors, can play either a warming or a cooling role. For decades, this has been the focus of fierce academic disputes.Previous IPCC reports tended to assume that clouds would have a neutral impact because the warming and cooling feedbacks would cancel each other out. But in the past year and a half, a body of evidence has been growing showing that the net effect will be warming. This is based on finer resolution computer models and advanced cloud microphysics.“Clouds will determine humanity’s fate – whether climate is an existential threat or an inconvenience that we will learn to live with,” said Palmer. “Most recent models suggest clouds will make matters worse.”In a recent paper in the journal Nature, Palmer explains how the new Hadley Centre model that produced the 5+C figure on climate sensitivity was tested by assessing its accuracy in forecasting short-term weather. This testing technique had exposed flaws in previous models, but in the latest case, the results reinforced the estimates. “The results are not reassuring – they support the estimates,” he wrote. He is calling for other models to be tested in a similar way.The IPCC is expected to include the 5+C climate sensitivity figure in its next report on the range of possible outcomes. Scientists caution that this is a work in progress and that doubts remain because such a high figure does not fit with historical records.Catherine Senior, head of understanding climate change at the Met Office Hadley Centre, said more studies and more data were needed to fully understand the role of clouds and aerosols.“This figure has the potential to be incredibly alarming if it is right,” she said. “But as a scientist, my first response is: why has the model done that? We are still in the stage of evaluating the processes driving the different response.”While acknowledging the continued uncertainty, Rockström said climate models might still be underestimating the problem because they did not fully take into account tipping points in the biosphere.“The more we learn, the more fragile the Earth system seems to be and the faster we need to move,” he said. “It gives even stronger argument to step out of this Covid-19 crisis and move full speed towards decarbonising the economy.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/38850b6b7c05f5cf36293e5656f8566f0be36995/0_0_6000_4000/master/6000.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c4ffba93e9789810e8e0cb04af4b4de7 700w","title":"tamal ray recipe homemade jammy dodgers","story":"A simple, all-butter shortbread version of the classic biscuit that’s fun to make at home with the kidsMaking your own jammy dodgers might seem like a weird thing to do. After all, you can pick up a pack of 12 at any corner shop – how can you possibly improve upon that perfection? But these aren’t an exact replica of the store-bought variety, nor are they meant to be. Think of them instead as an homage: a simple buttery shortbread and a tangy, fruity jam that would go particularly well with a little spoonful of clotted cream.This is a good recipe to make with children, although the making of the jam should be done by an adult, because the jam spits as it cooks. You could save time instead by warming ready-made jam and stirring through the gelatine. If you haven’t a sugar thermometer, put a plate in the freezer for an hour ready to do the “wrinkle test” below.For the biscuit250g plain flour60g caster sugar⅛ tsp table salt175g cold, unsalted butter, cubed1 medium egg, beaten2 tbsp demerara sugar, to dust overFor the jam200g strawberries, chopped180g jam sugar30g lemon juice1 leaf of gelatine, in a bowl of cold waterTo make the biscuit dough, mix together the flour, caster sugar, salt and butter in the bowl of a food processor with the blade attachment fitted. Blitz until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs, then gradually pour in the egg, continuing to blitz until the mixture comes together in large clumps (you might not need to use all the egg). Tip out the dough and knead together briefly until smooth, then cover with clingfilm and leave to rest in the fridge for half an hour.While the dough chills, start making the jam. Stir the strawberries with the jam sugar and lemon juice in a saucepan, then simmer over a low-medium heat, covered, for three minutes. Remove the lid, turn up the heat and continue to cook for another five to eight minutes, giving an occasional stir to stop it catching on the bottom of the pan. The jam will be cooked when it reaches 104 degrees on a sugar thermometer, or you can also check that it’s set by placing a small blob on a plate which has been in the freezer for an hour – the jam will wrinkle when pushed. If it’s still liquid, check again after another minute or two of cooking.Pass the cooked jam through a fine sieve, then stir through the gelatine until dissolved. Set aside while you bake the biscuits.Take the dough out of the fridge, dust your work surface and rolling pin with a little flour, and roll the dough to 2-3mm thick. Use a 6cm cookie cutter to cut out rounds, then use a 2½cm cutter to remove the middles from half of them. Arrange the whole rounds and doughnuts on two separate baking sheets lined with greaseproof paper, then sprinkle the demerara sugar over the doughnuts.Bake at 190C (180C fan) gas 6 for eight to 10 minutes, until the biscuits are browning at the edges (the doughnuts will be baked sooner than the whole rounds). Leave the biscuits to cool, then spoon a little of the jam into the middle of each of the rounds, before topping with a doughnut biscuit."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/16204996571abe5f3b0e2cb28631a8aaedb3bf95/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1cb6ceeaa596139cb2d304f1a50e2482","title":"favourite european championship euro 2020","story":"Whether it’s the first you remember, the first you attended or the tournament your team won, we want to hear about itWhat a weekend of football we had in store.

United were almost as frustrated as Liverpool at the timing of the break. They had just completed their first league double over Manchester City in a decade and after an up and down season under Ole Gunnar Solskjær were looking a good bet – only three points behind Chelsea – for a fourth-place finish.A lot of that confidence was down to Bruno Fernandes, who provided an almost immediate uplift on his arrival from Sporting Lisbon in January, and partly because of that signing a confidence was spreading through the squad that Solskjær might be the right man in the right place after all. United are virtually assured of a place in the Europa League last eight after putting five goals past LASK away from home and are still in the FA Cup, with a quarter-final at Norwich awaiting the go-ahead.What about now? United supporters just want to see their club playing again, to check the improvement was real. Solskjær perhaps unwisely suggested a wealthy club such as United may be in a position to cherry pick the best players from less fortunate ones once the coronavirus crisis has blown over. The idea was quickly rejected by the executive vice-chairman, Ed Woodward, who said the club would be subject to the same straitened financial circumstances as everyone else. Judging by the number of top-level players United have been linked with during the hiatus Woodward was not widely believed but a more immediate concern at Old Trafford is whether Paul Pogba is ready to rejoin the fray after missing most of the season. Marcus Rashford is also understood to be close to fitness after missing United’s past few games with a back injury.What needs to be done to have a successful end to the season?\u0026nbspA Champions League place has always been at the forefront of United’s ambitions and it looks as if it could be accomplished by a top-four finish rather than the more arduous and unpredictable Europa League route. If that is achieved Solskjær will be judged a success, no question, despite some hairy moments in his first year in charge. United are not the sort of club who can pretend winning the FA Cup makes everything wonderful, two managers ago Louis van Gaal was sacked the day after a Wembley triumph. If Solskjær can oversee a return to the Champions League other bits of the jigsaw will fall into place and Mauricio Pochettino’s availability will be less of a distraction. Success may also include getting Pogba back on the pitch. Since the arrival of Fernandes there has been a feeling he may no longer be needed and United would be wise to cash in, though potentially the pair could provide a dynamic midfield partnership if they get the chance.Have players and staff behaved during lockdown? United have enjoyed, if that is the word, a quiet lockdown. Unless you count Pogba and Anthony Martial shaving their heads in the first couple of weeks.Any unsungcommunity heroes? Rashford received special recognition from the High Sheriff of Manchester for his charity work during the lockdown. The England striker helped raise over £20m for FareShare, a food-bank charity, and has also been involved in projects working with\u0026nbsphomeless people in Manchester.Key player in the run-in? Fernandes, if he keeps up his impact, or Rashford, if he is able to return in time. Pogba remains a possibility but United fans will believe it when they see it.End-of-season prediction\u0026nbspFourth place in Premier League. Silverware might beckon on two other fronts but United know what needs to be done and they had begun to resemble a team capable of doing it. In normal circumstances Solskjær might have had a tricky decision to make about which games to prioritise but the Europa League being pushed back in the calendar could work in his favour."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8e5ce72a88e0fe2bdc8f89a6ba3df71c0063daa8/0_71_3504_2103/master/3504.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dbe7e71bdc05a698fd86036b900b2595","title":"real mallorca v barcelona la liga live","story":"32 min: Kubo thrashes the free kick low and hard, around the wall. It’s straight at Ter Stegen, but hit with such venom that the keeper can only scoop it up and away in a very inelegant fashion. Barca hack clear, and it’s time for drinks.31 min: London Buses dept. The next foul comes along in short order, as Vidal clatters into Rodriguez, just to the right of the Barca D. This represents a very good opportunity for the hosts.29 min: The first foul of the game! It’s Alba on Pozo. Not often you have to wait so long to hear the ref’s shrill whistle.28 min: Kubo flicks cutely down the right to send Pozo on a touchline skitter. Pozo crosses deep in the hope of finding Budimir, but Pique clears. Marbella come straight back at them, though, Hernandez trying a snapshot amid a penalty-box muddle. That’s blocked, but Kubo has another go. His pea-roller is claimed by Ter Stegen without fuss or ceremony.26 min: The first lull of the game. Drinks break soon?24 min: That’s given Mallorca succour. Sastre goes bowling down the left, cuts infield and shapes to shoot. But then he pauses to think, and there’s no time for any of that nonsense. Vidal comes across and block-tackles him. Sortie over.22 min: And yet they could so easily be level. Kubo skedaddles dangerously down the right and glides inside, sashaying past Araujo with ease. He whips a fierce shot towards the top left, but Ter Stegen, at full extend, palms the ball around the post. What a run, what a shot, what a save. Great football all round, and a warning to Barca that they might yet not have it all their own way.20 min: Messi slices Mallorca open with a precision pass down the right for Sergio Roberto, who has been rampant since the get-go. But his low cross is behind both Griezmann and Braithwaite. Mallorca are hanging on.18 min: Messi slides a ball down the inside-right channel for Vidal, who is racing into a lot of space. But for once the great man’s radar is wonky, his pass way off, and Raillo is able to clear.16 min: Mallorca stream forward, Hernandez and Budimir leading the charge. The ball’s sent wide right towards Kubo, who diddles Alba but can’t get past Griezmann. The resulting corner, Mallorca’s first of the game, is a complete non-event.14 min: Messi slips a ball down the right for the incessant Sergio Roberto. A low cross leads to a melee in the middle, but despite the best efforts of Griezmann and Braithwaite, there’s no shot on goal. Mallorca clear with great desperation.12 min: Messi nutmegs Pozo to pass to Griezmann down the left. Griezmann pulls the ball back for Messi, who had kept running. Messi takes a whack. It’s deflected out for another wasted corner. Barca are really pushing to get their second goal. It feels like it’s coming soon.11 min: Messi sends De Jong scampering down the inside-right channel. De Jong shuttles the ball wider for Sergio Roberto, whose low cross is nearly met by Griezmann in the middle. Not quite, but a game of bagatelle ends in a corner for Barca. Nothing comes of the set piece, but that was another big chance for Barca.9 min: Kubo tries to make amends for his early error by tearing down the right at great speed. He’s got Alba on the back foot, but his cross is no good. Cleared. He comes again, testing Alba once more. This time Alba sticks to him and blocks his attempted pass towards Budimir. Much better from the highly-rated Real Madrid loanee.7 min: An awful lot of room for Sergio Roberto out on the right. He crosses low. Griezmann dummies for his strike partner, just to the left of goal, ten yards out. Braithwaite fizzes a low shot well wide of the left-hand post. He should have made it two.6 min: Barcelona are totally dominant, a goal up already, and Messi has yet to feature. This could be a long evening for Mallorca.4 min: Barcelona pass it around the back awhile, just because they can. Mallorca, no doubt shocked by that early blow, are chasing shadows at the minute.After 65 seconds, the champions take the lead! Kubo is robbed by De Jong, 25 yards from his own goal. The ball’s sent wide left for Alba, who crosses. Vidal stoops and guides a header into the bottom left, giving Reina no chance. What a start!Barca get the ball rolling! An early touch for the 21-year-old Araujo, who is making his full debut tonight. He’s played once before for the Barca first team, coming on as sub against Sevilla before getting himself sent off after a 14-minute cameo. Hope he has a better day today.The teams are out! A lot of noise at the Estadi de Son Moix - or the Visit Mallorca Estadi as it’s been re-branded - though at the moment that’s all down to the unnecessarily ear-splitting PA system. There’ll be some altogether more soothing Fifa 2020 sonics, plus full stands in the virtual style, when we kick off. But first a minute’s silence for the souls lost to Covid-19.Some pre-match reading ... courtesy of the Good Doctor and one of the ’s most famous readers, now a director at Mallorca.Kit and caboodle. Mallorca play in red shirts, so ...... Barca will turn out in third-choice mint green.There was some good news for relegation-haunted Mallorca earlier today. Villarreal won 1-0 at Celta Vigo thanks to a late goal by Manu Trigueros. Celta’s defeat means they remain just one point ahead of Mallorca in 17th. Should Mallorca cause an upset this evening by taking all three points, they’d bust out of the relegation zone, leapfrogging Celta and Eibar into the relative safety of 16th. But worst case, they’ll not lose any ground on Celta after a weekend they’ll have realistically written off. A free hit, then.The big team news: Lionel Messi has fully recovered from his thigh strain and starts Luis Suarez isn’t quite back up to speed yet, though, and only makes the bench. But with each team allowed five subs, there’s a fair chance Suarez will get a run-out in the second half. Meanwhile young Uruguayan centre-back Ronald Araujo is selected ahead of Samuel Umtiti, who like Suarez isn’t 100 percent fit.Mallorca will pin their hopes on leading scorer Ante Budimir, who has nine league goals to his name this season, two of them coming at Camp Nou. That’s one more than Antonie Griezmann has managed, but two fewer than Suarez and a whole ten behind Messi. Another stat to illustrate the gap between first and 18th: midfield kingpin Salva Sevilla has made 1170 successful passes so far this season, Mallorca’s only man to reach four figures Sergio Busquets and Gerard Pique have both clocked up over 1800.As La Liga resumes, reigning champions Barcelona are in pole position. They’re two points ahead of Real Madrid as they pursue title number 27. Lionel Messi has recovered from a thigh strain picked up in training last week, while Luis Suarez is available again after his January knee surgery. By contrast, tonight’s opponents Mallorca, promoted last season, are in a relegation scrap this time around. Barca saw them off with ease, 5-2, at Camp Nou back in December they’ve scored 14 goals in their last three meetings with the Balearic Islanders. This is surely only going to end one way.But there’s always hope in football. Mallorca were on a decent run before lockdown, with two wins and a draw in their last four matches. Barca, meanwhile, will still be smarting from a 2-0 loss in the clasico back at the start of March, and they’ve only won one away match in the league since the start of December.In fact, Barca’s away form this campaign has been of the eyebrow-bothering variety. Only 18 of their 63 league goals this season have been scored on the road. They’ve lost at Bilbao, Granada, Levante, Valencia and Real Madrid, and their performances at the only two teams below 18th-placed Mallorca haven’t been much better: a 2-2 draw at desperate neighbours Eyol and a come-from-behind 2-1 win at Leganes. Just five wins from 13 on the road for the champs, one hell of a contrast with their home record of 40 points from 42. Their goal difference at home is +33 their tally on the road is -1.None of this stops Barca being short-priced favourites for this match. They should stretch their lead at the top to five points before Real Madrid play Eibar tomorrow. But Mallorca’s top scorer Ante Budimir scored twice at Camp Nou in November, and if he adds to his nine-goal haul early on this evening, we could have ourselves a game. It kicks off at 9pm UK time, 10pm in Palma de Mallorca. It’s on!"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6c0c2239ec31ab5d2a803872a3fc71183e4bd600/0_380_5700_3420/master/5700.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f62d7373173c739db43fe9fbee2955d5","title":"brands fans and influencers why social media for small business is about more than sales","story":"Standing out online can transform a business, but it takes focus and strategy. Here, three stars of social share what they’ve learnedMost businesses these days will have some form of social media presence, but many may not be making the most of the opportunities it provides. Not only does it open up a huge potential customer base – half the world’s population is now on social media – it also gives companies the perfect opportunity to build and retain loyalty among existing customers.Like all aspects of technology, social media is constantly evolving. So while a small business may have set up a Facebook or a Twitter account a few years back and thought that was a case of “job done”, new social media platforms such as TiKTok have been developed since then, while Instagram and YouTube have become vital parts of a holistic social media ecosystem.\u0026nbspBeyond the platforms themselves, trends have also changed in terms of what users want, how they interact with brands and what’s important to them. Customers have now become fans, emotional ties to brands are a thing and thought-leadership can make you an influencer. Content is still king, and shareability is vital.\u0026nbspBut as well as all this modern stuff – the basics are still important too.\u0026nbsp“On the high street you wouldn’t have a shopfront with a broken window, peeling paint, rubbish everywhere and goods randomly thrown on displays, and expect to thrive,” says PR and social media expert Mike Crutchley.As someone who helps businesses improve and overhaul their social media strategies, he says first impressions count.\u0026nbsp“Social media channels must be up to date with everything from posts to contact details and opening hours,” he says. “High-quality images and videos, as well as good grammar and spelling are as vital as creating engaging posts.”The tools that allow businesses to make this happen have never been more accessible, and there is now an opportunity to try some of them out free of charge. Customers of the website builder GoDaddy are currently receiving a complimentary 90-day premium subscription to the mobile app Over, which gives them access to simple templates for creating sleek and effective social media content.Sometimes the things that work best on social media are the simplest. You can have all the metrics and dashboards in the world, but if people don’t engage and share your original posts then you’re missing a huge potential source of customers.\u0026nbspWhen Dutch-born Londoner Annemarie Plas saw people in countries throughout Europe clapping for their healthcare workers she was inspired to help set up something similar in her adopted home, and so created clapforourcarers with GoDaddy.Scaling up quickly could well have proved a challenge, but with the astute use of social media things have gone from strength to strength.\u0026nbsp“I just put together a small image and posted it on my socials such as Instagram, LinkedIn, Facebook and Twitter, and sent it to all my UK friends by WhatsApp, I also made a small website and an Insta page,” says Plas.\u0026nbspHer efforts to spread the word were given a huge boost when her campaign was picked up by influencers such as the Beckhams and the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, who shared it to their followers.\u0026nbspThe first clap happened on Thursday 26 March at 8pm and became a weekly event, being covered by the national media and circulated widely on social media too, right up to the final clap on 28 May.Although Plas has a background working for media agencies, she had neither the time nor staff support that other organisations might be able to draw upon. So she decided to keep things simple and made shareability a big part of her strategy.\u0026nbsp“I understood the importance of having simple and engaging messaging. I used a hashtag and made the image easy to share on any social channels.”Her simple and consistent messaging has resulted in the #clapforourcarers hashtag being shared more than 139,000 times on Instagram alone.\u0026nbsp“Some influencers get a bad reputation,” says Masha Zvereva, founder of Coding Blonde. She set up her blog back in 2015, when she was trying to learn some coding skills to make her more employable. She originally registered it with GoDaddy, which she then also used as a hosting provider.Through that blog, as well as Instagram and YouTube, Zvereva has amassed a loyal following and is now regarded as an influencer in the field of women in tech, entrepreneurship and personal growth.\u0026nbsp“Influencers can be perceived as fake, superficial, salesy etc, but what people don’t see is the hard work that goes behind being able to make a living off of this business model and growing your business,” she says.Quality content is paramount according to Zvereva. Whether you’re filming a video for YouTube or writing a thought leadership piece, it has to add value beyond simply advertising your skills to the wider world.\u0026nbsp“Anyone can become an influencer if they want to, but I’d recommend approaching it from the standpoint of adding value to an audience,” she says.\u0026nbsp“What’s the purpose behind your blog? How will you be impacting people’s lives and who is your target audience? And finally, why should it be you?”Many people might still associate social media in a business context purely with selling, but its importance when it comes to building a brand can’t be overstated.\u0026nbspThis is something Zaffrin and Brian O’Sullivan, co-founders of the vegan skincare company Five Dot Botanics set out to do well before their company launched.Establishing it on Instagram even before they had products to sell, they were able to develop a loyal audience.\u0026nbsp“Social media has allowed small brands like mine to build a brand. Historically it would not have been possible to launch a beauty brand without millions of pounds to acquire customers through marketing,” says Zaffrin.\u0026nbspBefore setting up those social channels though, their first move was to register a domain name and get a URL through GoDaddy. Then it was time to get the ball rolling with social media.\u0026nbspThe stories the O’Sullivans shared weren’t all about success, but about the challenges they were facing. This honesty helped create a situation where people were rooting for them. The couple were also able to get 600 people signed up to their newsletter email list so there was already an eager customer base waiting for when the products were ready.Once the social channels were up and running, the O’Sullivans set up an internet landing page using GoDaddy’s services – and they were in business.Social continues to be at the heart of their marketing. As well as using Instagram for brand-building, Zaffrin posts to Pinterest and Facebook, although she says the latter works best for business if you’re willing to put money behind it – paying for targeted ads, for example.

She was responding to claims that the fashion blog she originally started in her early 20s had failed its former staffers of color.“The team deserves a chance to show you what Man Repeller can be with me on the sidelines,” she wrote in a statement, “so I am going to step back and let them show you.”In the last week, Man Repeller has also been criticized for allegedly letting go at least one staffer of color since the pandemic took hold, according to Vox. Vox also reported that one former staffer of color says she was largely ignored by Cohen in the months before she left the company.Man Repeller is hardly unique in failing to hire and retain writers of color. Just this week, the editor-in-chief of Bon Appétit, Adam Rapoport, resigned after employees spoke out about the toxic, racist culture within its staff, and Refinery29 founder Christene Barberich stepped down after former black and brown employees accused the company of discrimination.Although it’s uncertain exactly how Cohen will be involved in Man Repeller going forward (her Instagram post shared no detail of what being “on the sidelines” means), the website clearly has a number of areas to address, including the future of its content.Folded alongside the critique of racism is another cry from Man Repeller readers: that the fashion blog – built on the idea that women should wear whatever they want, even if it makes men recoil – has lost some of the irreverent, sharp-tongued ethos that made it take-off as a media brand in the early 2010s.“I found this site a breath of fresh air when I found it a few years ago,” reads one comment on Cohen’s letter, before claiming much of the content it publishes today is more straightforward lifestyle writing, with a focus on dating and, increasingly, marriage. “I don’t say this to be rude. I appreciate people who put their writing out there, knowing it will inevitably be criticized. I guess I just want to ask y’all who you think you’re serving with these more recent pieces?”As a longtime reader of Man Repeller, I’ve found myself asking similar questions about the website’s meandering direction, even before Cohen stepped down. The voice and style I used to love seems absent from the website most days visiting its homepage gives the impression of a rudderless venture. There is still lots of content about getting dressed, just now mixed with posts about aperitivo hour with your husband or letting your husband choose your clothes for a week.Right. Like many blogs, Cohen’s started out as a personal experiment at a different time on the internet, when first-person writing had yet to become the norm, and fashion media was hungry for zany, personable voices like hers and Tavi Gevinson’s, of Rookie fame.In the beginning, Man Repeller was just about Cohen’s personal style: the (often expensive, designer) clothes she was wearing, and why. But the site was always a mix of high- and lowbrow, and there was something thrilling about watching Cohen breathlessly pair clothes that (as the name suggests) might provoke shock or even disgust. In the decade since then, the internet has changed, and so has Man Repeller. Even Cohen has acknowledged the limitations of a website that singularly revolves around the act of getting dressed. “I’ve changed so much in the past seven years and I’m sure that if Man Repeller was still so literally a personal style blog about trends that women love and men hate, I wouldn’t feel energized and motivated every day,” she told Vogue UK.In 2020, “man repelling” also rings hollow as a concept. Who, exactly, needs to be told to stop caring about what men think? It assumes the audience is starting from a place of self-consciousness, of being concerned with what men think of their choices, and need some nudging in the opposite direction.For years, Cohen has been the face (and driven much of the voice) of Man Repeller without her, the website could become anything, and it will be up to the current staff to decide what that means. Maybe it’s time to burn it all down and start over from scratch."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6b3ad77b1a1efb1af02f3ab6c7b3251e3decdf88/0_35_1167_700/master/1167.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e870bcb97efeade1eddac31008ae8206","title":"my dads shed is my darkroom inside 12 lockdown art studios","story":"This year’s art and fashion graduates are finding alternative ways to be creativeShannon Moran, marine and natural history photography, Falmouth School of ArtI’ve stayed in Cornwall, where I share a house.

Instead, I’ve created a pop-up workspace in my parents’ living room in Leeds to make light-sensitive cyanotype prints using objects from home – ethereal imagery that encompasses light and colour. I’ve used their red curtains to act as a dark room for the light-sensitive chemicals, and the garden to expose them in the sunlight, hanging them to dry on the washing line.

She’s trying to do all her schoolwork and, well, she’s kind of decided that’s her space now. So I’m downstairs… we’re all dotted around the house, me and David and the boys, trying to work, trying to get schoolwork done. There’s often someone holding a laptop up to a window, trying to get reception.” Whoever you are, 2020 has had its challenges.As a patron of Graduate fashion week, Beckham is on the line to answer questions sent in by fashion students from all over the country. “To be honest, I feel like I have so many more questions than I do answers, right now – like everyone else,” she says. Still, she is optimistic that this strangest of final terms will prove a valuable learning experience. “The generation coming into adulthood now will have experienced something that none of the rest of us have. I feel like this has taught all of us a lot about how to work together as teams, both in our home lives and professionally. This crisis will have expanded the horizons of all of us, in a way.” Harper has been required by her school to wear uniform at home, “which at first I thought was a bit strange, I wasn’t expecting it. But for her it helps, because it keeps her routine going.” For the rest of the family, sartorial standards have slipped a little. “I’d love to say my lockdown look has been all about a vintage kaftan, but that’s not the case. I still get up early and exercise every day, then I dress for work and for comfort. A pair of old jeans, a T-shirt or a jumper. I’m not quite at the elasticated waistband stage yet – I still want to feel good about myself. We’ve been going out on country walks every day, so the only shoes I wear are an old pair of trainers. It’s so nice just to do things with the family and not think too much about getting dressed. So, definitely no heels.”Beckham’s own lockdown got off to a shaky start. The planned furloughing of 30 staff at her label led to a backlash, and the decision was reviewed. Since then, working remotely with her design team, she has been trying to figure out what the next few seasons look like. “It’s not only about the clothes, or the design – it’s about the mood, what feels right. And all the practical issues – like, how do we shoot anything? I’ve also been trying to use this time to find inspiration for business strategy. A lot is going to change. I’ve been focusing not just on the collection coming up, but on what is the calendar going to look like? The concept of the fashion show needs to be rethought, but what does that mean? Will it be smaller presentations? Will it be digital? It’s impossible to know what the future will bring.”In the not-too-distant future, Beckham is looking forward to getting back into her London workspace. “I can’t wait to get the atelier up and running again. There is so much that you can do digitally now, but at a certain point you need to be able to put your hands on the clothes.” She might be ready to ditch the jeans and trainers soon, too. “I do miss getting dressed. A nice pub lunch with family and friends, a few glasses of wine. I’m really grateful for the family time, but I’m ready to be a little bit sociable now.”It sounds like a good moment to hand over to the students…No, not really. When I was in the Spice Girls there were stylists who dressed the group, but in my personal life I have never worked with a stylist. I used to wear lots of structured dresses with corsetry, and I do still have some of those dresses, but my personal style has become more relaxed. Looking back, I guess it was a sign of insecurity that I would always wear clothes that were very tight, very fitted.As the business took off and I got busier, my style changed, because I just can’t run around the studio doing everything in high heels. I’m juggling a lot: being a mum, being a wife, being in the studio every day. I remember one time at a show in New York where I wore a pair of masculine trousers and trainers, and everyone went crazy, “Oh my God, she’s wearing trainers!” My confidence has definitely grown as I’ve got older. I know what works on me, what looks good, what makes me feel confident and comfortable. I don’t feel I have anything to prove now in the way I dress.Alex Copeland, fashion marketing, University of East LondonMusic has always been such a huge part of me and who I am, and not just because of the Spice Girls. When I’m in the atelier, I love listening to whatever the team are into – it might be a new band I haven’t heard of that one of the team went to see the night before. A couple of seasons ago we went through a phase of listening to a lot of Led Zeppelin.Right now there’s always music on in the house, whether that’s me playing it or David or the kids. The new Justin Bieber album has been a bit of a lockdown family favourite. It depends who has taken control of the docking station. David is sitting outside right now, listening to 90s soul and R\u0026ampB.I don’t know. If you know, please tell me! This is what everyone is talking about. Will the presentation of collections be more digital? I’ve always been interested in the digital space we had an e-commerce site before we had a bricks-and-mortar store. I believe that people will be travelling less, which I hope will make the industry a more level playing field. It will be less about those crazily expensive shows that only the biggest brands can afford, and more about creativity. And the timetable is going to have to adjust, because doing so many collections each year seems like it’s going to feel outdated after this.It seemed obvious that it had to be Victoria Beckham. I knew there were preconceptions attached to my name, but that was a challenge I was prepared to take on. Honestly? There was never really any other option.I always want to better myself, so criticism is always useful. I started out with just 10 dresses in my first collection, and as the brand grew I learned so much from people who taught me the shape of what a proper fashion collection looks like. They showed me that a fashion brand isn’t just about what you put on the catwalk, it’s about price points, what the customer wants and when. I had a lot to learn when I started out, and I had to surround myself with people who knew about all that stuff.Lara Hammersley, fashion communication and promotion, Norwich University of the ArtsI’m always inspired by the 90s. The colour, the simple shapes. There probably isn’t a designer who isn’t inspired by that decade. For me, it’s not so much about the street fashion of the 90s, but Martin Margiela, and Jil Sander. Not just the collections, but the shows, the models, the music.Get as technologically savvy as you can, because that is going to be key. It’s also true that this is going to be a hard moment, economically. We are likely to be in a period of recession. So it will be important to think outside of the box in terms of how and where you can make a living. Everyone is going to have to work that little bit harder to succeed in their chosen field, while we all navigate coming out of this situation.I’m fortunate to have had the opportunity to travel extensively, and a lot of inspiration has come from places I’ve been. Moving forward, we won’t be travelling so much, I guess. But then I live in London, and where is more inspiring than London? The art is incredible. Tate Britain is a favourite place, which is why I was so thrilled when we did our show there a few seasons ago. When I was in New York, I used to love going to the Frick Collection – I think it would be hard to find an environment that was more beautiful for looking at art.Daniella James, fashion media and marketing, Plymouth College of ArtSometimes I can get a little bit overwhelmed. There’s just so much to do, with eyewear and beauty and everything else. I don’t ever want to get stuck in a rut, so sometimes it’s about finding inspiration in something that you find challenging, something that is a bit out of your comfort zone. Sometimes inspiration comes from looking at something that I wouldn’t necessarily wear, and thinking about how to get from that place to creating something I find beautiful. It’s a balance, because I don’t want the brand to be predictable – but it still has to be believably “me”.Enjoy the journey. I have. Also, go with your gut instinct. I always say I can handle mistakes that were made by me, but not mistakes that were made against my instinct. Trust that gut – it’s there for a reason.Kelsie March, fashion design, University of HertfordshireI wouldn’t call them knockbacks. I’m a glass-half-full kind of person. Everyone has challenges. The thing is to learn from them.Ravina Kazim, fashion, University for the Creative Arts, RochesterI love what I do now, because it is a true creative output for me. I love making women feel like the best version of themselves. I had a lot of fun with the Spice Girls, but I don’t miss those days and I don’t miss being on stage. That was then and this is now. Fashion is where I feel comfortable, and where I feel excited. I’m looking forward to the future in this industry, actually. I feel like we can all come out of this better, personally and professionally. • Comments on this piece are premoderated to ensure the discussion remains on the topics raised by the article.

Between work and family, these values weren’t always easy to maintain – but they’ve found a path that works for both of themNames:\u0026nbspJeska Rees and Simon WilsonYears together:\u0026nbsp14 Occupations:\u0026nbspAcademic and doctorWhen Simon Wilson proposed to Jeska Rees in 2008, she was torn. The couple was living in London, where she was doing her postdoctoral fellowship in feminist studies,\u0026nbspand they were on holiday in Yorkshire when he popped the question.“I was so delighted that Simon wanted to make our relationship permanent, and I was so pleased for him that he was able to go down on one knee. It’s very exciting,” she says now. “But politically I am opposed to marriage and always have been, so it was difficult. I think I said, ‘Yes but no.’ ”It had taken time to get to that point. They had met years before through mutual university friends. They were both from Perth but Wilson was studying medicine in Adelaide at the time, so he’d often turn up at parties. Rees remembers thinking he was cool:\u0026nbsp“He was very tall, quiet and kind but hard to get to know. He was quite elusive in a way. He’d just turn up out of nowhere sometimes.”And in between all the debating, there was plenty of snogging too.\u0026nbspThey were drawn to each other but somehow it didn’t stick. But they kept in touch with emails and mixtapes filled with Britpop bands. They had much in common: they’re both children of UK immigrants and share an absurd sense of humour. “There are lots of jokes between us that other people don’t understand ... Simon took it to the extreme in terms of looking very straight but actually being quite bent in terms of his humour.”\u0026nbspThings were casual for a while even though Rees visited Adelaide a few times and Wilson spent time with her when he was back in Perth. Rees had asked him out a few times but he’d gently declined. “Throughout the whole entire time while we were inching together, we were both very self-sufficient.”But in July 2006 they made things official and Rees moved to Adelaide: “We deliberately kept it vague, but actually the decisions we made indicated that it was quite serious. I moved in with Simon straight away in Adelaide. We had a discussion about that, but I had my own room in his house. I think we were testing it.”After Adelaide, they moved to London, then back to Australia where Wilson completed his medical training. Not long after that, Rees found she was pregnant with their first child and they settled in Castlemaine, where Wilson had his first practice.\u0026nbspThis was, they agree, the most challenging time. They were juggling too many things at once: a baby, a demanding job, and a new home in a country town, far from family supports. Rees in particular struggled with the demands of her new life.“I felt like I’d made all these decisions quite willingly, but somehow I’d compromised some of my most cherished ideas which were an equal ision of labour, non-traditional gender roles.\u0026nbspI’d never planned to have children until I met Simon, and then when I met Simon I decided that that was a good idea,” she says. “And then we did it and it was very difficult.”Wilson was also feeling the pressure. Things came to a head: “Luckily there was just enough glue to hold us together to move and try something new,” he says.\u0026nbsp“I got burnt out at work with workload and Jess was getting very isolated and angry at home, so we changed completely. We left that country town and came to Melbourne.\u0026nbspI stepped down significantly with work and Jess got a job. I looked after the children.”\u0026nbspTheir lives improved dramatically in Melbourne. “I felt like I had a life outside the house and that that was important,” Rees says. “I felt equally that it was important that Simon spent time with the kids and that they spent time with him. He’s always been very hands-on when he’d been at home, but he just hadn’t been at home very much. I happily left them to paint and make biscuits and went off to work.”They made a point of figuring out how their lives aligned with their values and beliefs.\u0026nbsp“Being a feminist in a traditional heterosexual relationship is quite hard. I think there are limits to what you can reinvent,”, says Rees. “You are expected to behave in a very … standardised way at work and then you’ve got children who’ve got to have play dates. You’ve got to talk to other parents who might not agree with you. There are all these ways in which your personality becomes compressed.”\u0026nbspAlthough it was a difficult time, there was a happy upside. “I recall going through a really strong second honeymoon phase around then because we’d worked through something so difficult and because we were enjoying our new life and feeling the love very powerfully at that point. So it was a really low point and then quite a high point,” Rees says.\u0026nbspThese days with two young children there are still plenty of demands on their time. But they’re better at planning and meshing their lives. Each morning they have a quick meeting to schedule everything. “We understand how important something is to the other. If Simon wants to go for a run, then I know that’s important so just slot that in somewhere. If I say to him that I need to go and do some kind of errand, then we work that into the day too.”They try to balance their professional ambitions. “It’s about making sure that everyone has professional opportunities with financial equality,” Rees says, “and about telling our children that the world is constructed, not natural, and you can construct your own.”\u0026nbspAdd to that their domestic duties. Rees says: “I think that’s an ongoing negotiation all the time. It’s been very important to address imbalances there continuously.”But their commitment to each other has meant they do what’s required to make it work: “I need to think about Jeska in my decisions and plans. And I previously have not done that well,” Wilson says. “Commitment has meant thinking a lot more what ... my actions or things that I might plan mean for us as a unit, rather than me as an inidual.”They don’t get a lot of time together but what they do get, they spend wisely, going bushwalking or to the movies. “I think we get along so well … that even if there’s only a small amount of time, that’s enough.”The lessons they’ve learned over the years has meant their approach to conflict has changed.\u0026nbsp“I think I’m readier to recognise when I need to listen now,” Wilson says. Rees agrees: “There’s more trust … I think for Simon it was about avoiding discussion. For me it was about going in too hard … We’ve met in the middle now where we both understand that a gentle, honest approach is going to be the most productive.”While they’ve both changed in ways their younger selves wouldn’t have expected, they’ve supported each other through that. “It’s been a very gradual change. Children obviously change things a lot … You need to have a firm base for them in routine,” Wilson says. Things like mortgages, health insurance and interest rates are the last things these two idealists thought they’d be discussing, but there are advantages: “I don’t think we lost our integrity, but we realised that life is bigger than we thought,” Rees says.\u0026nbspReconciling their ideals with the comforts of suburban life still takes effort. “Understanding that nothing’s perfect. Our relationship isn’t perfect. Our political theories aren’t perfect … We need to pick out bits that are going to work for us in the moment, constantly revisit it, and work out where the sacrifice and the compromise is going to be,” Rees says.“All I can do is understand that I chose Simon because I love him and because we can do amazing things … You live your politics through your actions.

Cancelled, too, is the wider tour Laura Marling would have undertaken in support of her seventh album, Song for Our Daughter.Instead, the British singer-songwriter takes to the stage of a deserted Union Chapel with only five camerapeople, a handful of sound crew and a skeleton venue staff for company. According to Marling’s representatives, 4,000 tickets have been sold – a figure that would have filled this atmospheric venue four times over and then some. (A second gig follows, pretty much the same set all over again, geo-fenced for US fans.)The camera finds Marling almost casually. She is a pale, white-blond figure in an oatmeal polo neck and faded jeans, lit by halogen footlights and a few candles. Standing at the microphone, guitar in hand, her full-body pallor is gradually revealed to be in painterly contrast with the rich, three-dimensional dusk of the venue.It all looks sumptuous – emphatically not like wobbly mobile phone footage from someone’s kitchen, the “gigs” that fans have been surviving on in lockdown. One immediate upside of the careful, circling camerawork is being able to see Marling – whose dextrous, fluid musicianship doesn’t get the kudos it deserves – play her guitar up close. Later, director Giorgio Testi will use multiple distant camera angles to film Marling against the fading light streaming in through the stained glass above the nave.With no preamble, Marling begins a suite of four songs from her 2013 album, Once I Was an Eagle, which deal forensically with leave-takings and foundering love. In one of her regular guitar tutorials from lockdown, Marling explained that she wrote these songs as one meditative 10-minute salvo. It has become her go-to opening for solo acoustic gigs.It works: the exhilarating run up the frets that Marling’s fingers take on Take the Night Off creates the rush of liftoff. Strange as it seems, initially this is a show that does not lack for emotional heft. The guitar turbulence also hints at the roiling going on beneath the alabaster surface of her delivery.This gig’s hyper-focused stage management might not work for a different kind of artist – there’s little room for wild catharsis here – but it does, in spades, for Marling. There has long been something of a stiff upper lip to her – a very English reserve with which she has conveyed tales of passion from a kind of deep freeze.This setting allows her to perform her songs with perfect control, creating an atmosphere broken only for a moment when a roadie hands Marling a guitar for What He Wrote. She only makes eye contact with the camera briefly, a few songs from the end, on Goodbye England later, there is a brief half-smile.Moreover, such a successful staging points forward to a potentially key source of income for artists starved of touring cash. There is such an optimism to this gig: that if you build a special show, the fans will come, and pay £12 for a virtual night out (plus a discretionary donation, split between Refuge and the Trussell Trust). Clearly, no beer will be spilt no one will fall in love with a stranger. You can’t even shout requests because the comments are disabled.Ultimately, Marling herself makes this an event worth tuning into. Her output just seems to get better and better, even as her songs ape obvious sources more and more openly: Joni Mitchell and Bob Dylan, a little Leonard Cohen.Unlike many releases, which lockdown pushed back, the drop of Marling’s latest album, Song for Our Daughter, was pulled forward to April from August there was little point, she felt, in sitting on it. It followed a break in which Marling wrote original music for Peaky Blinders and collaborated with theatre director Robert Icke on his production of Mary Stuart. A previous album interlude found Marling becoming a yoga teacher. She is currently studying for a master’s in psychoanalysis.All of this searching comes to some kind of a head on these newest tracks, four of which form a mid-set suite of their own, denuded of their album orchestrations but still gleaming. Marling’s writing, never obvious, takes on a fresh maturity here: Fortune tells of a woman’s secret stash of cash, in case she ever needed to run.Best of all, Held Down is not the final song, but it is the peak of the set, another tale of leave-taking whose melody almost swaggers. When this most retro of trailblazers leaves, it’s with as little fuss as she began."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/20e224368694f02db1d63ef736934da6690cbd92/0_18_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=01f5ed3327e1d5fc7d19f157fa1bbecf","title":"how the disappearance of madeleine mccann became a national obsession podcast","story":"The disappearance of a three -year-old British girl at a Portuguese holiday resort in 2007 quickly became a global news story as the hunt for her grew ever more extensive.

I remember laughing so much at school that I frequently had to clutch my front bottom to stop the wee coming out. This was once triggered by the girl standing next to me farting very loudly during assembly – seriously, she let off as loudly as a trumpet at the precise moment we’d all finished singing a hymn. I still call this state of helpless incontinent hilarity “school assembly” laughter, and when I’m gigging, this is the Richter-scale level of laughter I’m after. I want to see every woman in the audience crossing her legs and clutching her front bottom.In real life, of course, wetting yourself as an adult is the stuff of nightmares, immediately you are the primary school pant wetter, the girl who had to borrow a pair of knickers from the lost property box, oh the shame of it.The fact is, losing control of your bladder can happen for all kinds of reasons, from simple timing issues, ie finding yourself locked out of the house and not being able to find your front door key, to suffering from various medical conditions that affect bladder control.For some reason, adult female incontinence still tends to be a taboo subject, although there probably isn’t a female comic who hasn’t gone through motherhood without making an “every time I cough, I wet my pants” stress-incontinence gag. A few years ago, during a Grumpy Old Women Live show, I performed some menopausal material about having a go on a kids’ trampoline: “Thirty seconds later, I’d pissed myself, broken both my ankles and one tit had escaped its moorings,” I joshed. And judging by the reaction of the audience, a great many of them had been there, done that and had to go home to change their underwear.In my experience, as long as we women are in control of the joke then we can laugh about it. It’s when other people (often younger and frequently male) take ownership of our physical frailties that it becomes embarrassing and somehow more shameful.For many women over 50, a little bit of leaking now and then is a fact of life – many of us haven’t got the toned pelvic floors we once had, thanks mostly to having big headed babies, and while some of us will never need to use pads, others feel safer with some protection, “just in case”.As a woman who has spent more than her fair share of time on the motorway sharing cars with other female performers, it has always surprised me how some women need to stop at a service station to use the loo every 20 minutes, while others manage a good five hundred miles without needing a wee.The fact is that all bladders are different, some resemble oversized leather footballs, while others, like my friend Nina’s (I’ve changed her name) are thimble sized and made from gossamer. Nina has never managed to make it to the interval of any show without climbing over everyone’s laps to get to the ladies.For a number of women, bladder training can be incredibly useful. A friend of mine swears blind that Princess Anne once informed her that “when one urinates, one must always sit for another 30 seconds after you think you’ve finished, as you inevitably haven’t, there’s usually a few drops more”. This is singly the best tip for anyone suffering from post-micturition dribble. Basically, slow down and give yourself time to do the job properly. Then “give your lettuce a good shake” as the old saying goes and remember to wipe from front to back, because we don’t want a yeast infection on top of everything else.Lord knows, women are born with complicated plumbing and as we get older some of our pipework can start to drip now and then, but you know what? Unless you’re wearing a gusset of galvanised steel, there’s no reason why anyone should know.Of course in the olden days women would rather die of shame than talk to anyone about bladder weakness, but one of the great things about being a 21st-century woman is that we know this kind of thing is common.So remember girls, incontinence is not a moral weakness, it’s not laziness, it’s a fact of life for millions, so whatever you do, keep laughing and don’t let a little bit of wee spoil your fun.As incontinence affects one in three women over 35, we should all be having more open conversations about this everyday condition that impacts women of all ages.

But in another about-turn, travellers on flights from the UK will not be accepted when the Mediterranean country reopens to tourism on Monday.Bowing to new advice from the EU, Athens announced on Friday that the suspension of air links with Britain, in effect since March, will continue to be enforced until 30 June.Greek officials told the  the decision was in line with the EU commission’s latest recommendation that travel restrictions at the bloc’s external borders be phased out gradually and in “a strictly coordinated” manner. UK passenger flights are expected to be reinstated from 1 July onwards.In a surprise move that appeared to be motivated by Athens’ announcement that international flights to the Greek capital and Thessaloniki could resume from 15 June, EU Commissioner for Home Affairs Ylva Johansson, said on Thursday the EU was now advising that travel restrictions on non-essential travel be prolonged until 30 June.The tourist-dependent country had previously declared that regular passenger flights to its two main airports could restart in a “bridge phase” from 15-30 June. International air links would resume nationwide on 1 July, three months after restrictions were imposed to prevent the spread of the novel virus. “These were EU recommendations, we had to go along with them,” said a senior government source.In an effort to contain the pandemic amid mounting concerns among Greek epidemiologists of the virus being imported, it was also announced that all passengers from Italy, Spain and the Netherlands would undergo tests upon arrival as the country prepares for foreign visitors for the first time since the Covid-19 lockdown in March. Until 30 June, tourists from Italy, Spain and the Netherlands will only be able to fly into Athens.A recent spike in confirmed coronavirus cases, described as “worrying” by infectious disease experts advising the government, has been attributed in part to travellers undergoing mandatory tests upon arrival.“Our goal is for Greece to remain a safe country looking forward to the tourism season,” said the health minister, Vassilis Kikilias.Greek authorities say arrivals who test positive will have to quarantine for 14 days at a designated hotel paid by the Greek state.With fewer than 190 coronavirus deaths among 11 million residents, the Mediterranean country is looking to market itself as a healthy holiday destination.Seasonal hotels are to reopen on 15 June, two weeks after all-year hotels returned to business. Hotel staff will be subject to regular tests, as will guests.On popular islands “Covid-19 rooms” have also been set aside to quarantine anyone testing positive for the virus, and each hotel has to have a contracted physician on call.In 2019, Greece posted a record year with over 34 million visitors, but operators say a realistic goal for this season is just a third of that number."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5d64f4fce486c2ef6fdc28eeaae69ca3d4314dd5/1_0_1207_724/master/1207.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=68acc64a5bea1e4865fb8efbb014236c","title":"radio podcast call keir lbc review shade podcast nut jobs great post office trial banged up","story":"The Labour leader actually answered listeners’ questions on his LBC phone-in. Plus an impressive new podcast about race and creativityWe’ve been treated to Phone Farage and Call Clegg… now it’s Sir Keir Starmer’s turn to have a phone-in slot on LBC. Or “Ss-KEeah”, as most of the callers said his name, a little like a sneeze. On Monday morning, Starmer sat in on Nick Ferrari’s breakfast show, at the correct social distance, and answered listeners’ questions. Boris Johnson used to have a similar slot, but our prime minister doesn’t venture out of the house so much these days.\u0026nbspStarmer was good, I thought: calm, clear, direct. When asked for opinions he gave them. A caller brought up Barry Gardiner, the Labour politician who had attended a Black Lives Matter demonstration: “No, he shouldn’t have done it,” said Starmer. “He was wrong.” What about the new 14-day quarantine when arriving in the UK? Starmer would prefer on-the-spot testing on arrival and then a 24-hour wait for the results at an airport hotel. (The listeners weren’t fond of that solution.) Brexit? “It’s no secret that I voted Remain… but we have left the EU. The LeaveRemain ide is over, it is gone the argument now is about what the future relationship with the EU should look like.”Ferrari wondered if the Bristol statue of Edward Colston should have been toppled by demonstrators. It shouldn’t have been brought down “in that way”, said Starmer, but added: “That statue should have been taken down a long, long time ago… This was a man who was responsible for 100,000 people being moved from Africa to the Caribbean as slaves, including women and children who were branded on their chests with the name of the company he ran. And of the 100,000, 20,000 died en route and they were chucked in the sea.” There was no place for such a statue, he said, in 21st-century Britain. Good.It was another of Ferrari’s own questions, the last one, which proved the most revealing. “So, your parents were quite politically minded?” he asked, after Starmer said that he was named Keir after Labour party founder, Keir Hardie, and Starmer agreed that, yes, his had been a Labour family. His dad, a toolmaker, “worked in a factory all his life” and his mum, who had been a nurse, died three weeks before her son was elected as an MP. She’d had a long-term illness, said Starmer. “What was the condition she had?” said good journo Ferrari, venturing where most polite conversations don’t. It was Still’s disease, a rare condition “where your immune system attacks itself”, Starmer said. In the last years of her life, his mother couldn’t walk or speak, and had her leg amputated. “She’s never spoken to our children,” said Starmer, using the present tense. “As a teenager I spent a lot of time in high dependency units with my mum, watching the NHS saving her life.”You may like Starmer or you may not, but it was heartening to hear a politician who was steady and honest, who gave straightforward answers and was across the issues that mattered. Plus, he didn’t appear to be using the media for its ego-boosting jollies and rabble-rousing opportunities. Amazing how refreshing that seems now.\u0026nbspAlso refreshing is the new batch of independent podcaststo enlighten and expand our thinking. Here’s one: Shade Podcast, hosted by writer and photographer Lou Mensah. She invites people from the worlds of creativity and activism to have conversations about anti-racism. Occasionally there are a few bumpy sound issues, but Mensah’s guests are fascinating – far from the usual hello-mate merry-go-round of podcast invitees. I hopped between episodes, choosing three. One featured curator Angelina Coronado, who talked about the black diaspora and Dominican people in particular another, photography lecturer Daniel C Blight, who discussed the white gaze and the harm that “whiteness” (as opposed to just people with white skin) does to us all. And the third gave us Orla and Matilda, two sixth-form student activists from Fill in the Blanks, which campaigns to have British colonial history taught on the national curriculum. Mensah’s seriousness and personal approach meant that every episode gave me something new to think about. Inspiring stuff.\u0026nbspNut Jobs\u0026nbspAussie comedian Marc Fennell was last heard as the presenter of the 2019 hit podcast It Burns, where he tried to track down the world’s hottest chilli. Nut Jobs is another food-themed show that starts with a low-key premise: Fennell checks out the theft of a truckload of almonds in California. The story develops into a $10m black-market investigation, with Fennell examining every angle, from the undocumented workers to law enforcement officers to wellness food fads. His friendly charm means everyone opens up to him in this strange and fascinating tale.The Great Post Office TrialIn the early 2000s, the Post Office installed new computer software that kept giving false accounts. The Post Office’s bosses ignored all reports of this, and instead insisted that many innocent subpostmasters were stealing money. The subpostmasters were fired, prosecuted and some went to jail. This disgraceful story is told in 10 15-minute episodes by Nick Wallis, the BBC journalist who, over 10 years, uncovered this appalling miscarriage of justice. Covered by Private Eye and by Panorama, it’s Wallis who did the hard work. He should win all the awards going.\u0026nbspBanged UpRob Morrison and Mike (Boats) Boateng met while doing time in Rochester prison.

Voters stood in line to vote for upwards of four hours, saying they never received mail-in ballots requested weeks ago. Local officials, forced to consolidate polling locations because of Covid-19, were unable to manage the influx of voters and struggled to operate new voting equipment.\u0026nbspExperts worry that poll worker shortages, long lines and other delays in processing requests for absentee ballots will only get worse in November, when there will be more voters. Since March, voting advocates have been calling on states to prepare for an election like no other, and quickly implement plans that accommodate a surge in voters casting their ballots by mail for the first time as well as robust turnout at the polls.One estimate places the cost of upgrading vote-by-mail systems across the country at $4bn.“We’re just going to have a catastrophe in November,” said Michael McDonald, a professor at the University of Florida who studies elections. “We’ve already passed the point of catastrophic failure. It doesn’t get any better if we have two to three times the number of people who are trying to vote in these polling locations.”Not every primary in the Covid-19 era has been a disaster, and there has been strong turnout in many states as Americans have embraced voting by mail at unprecedented levels. But Georgia was far from the only place where there have been serious election problems.Voters in Nevada waited hours in line to vote in the state’s primary on Tuesday, even after the state moved to conduct its election largely by mail. Earlier this month, election officials in Pennsylvania and Washington DC struggled to meet the crush of requests for absentee ballots and voters in the nation’s capital waited hours to vote. Voters in Baltimore, Maryland, didn’t get ballots and faced long lines. In April, voters in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, waited hours to vote in the state’s primary as the city was forced to condense its usual 180 polling places into just five.\u0026nbspMost glaring, voting groups say, has been the disproportionate impact the election failures have had on communities of color. LaTosha Brown, a co-founder of Black Voters Matter, told Politico it took her three hours to vote in her majority African American precinct in Atlanta on Tuesday, but she saw no line at a polling place in a predominantly white area later in the day. State officials have launched an investigation into what went wrong in Fulton county, which includes Atlanta.“Black voters in particular appear especially hard-hit,” said Kristen Clarke, president and executive director of the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, which has closely monitored the primaries. “In some parts of the country, it feels like officials are making reckless decisions that are a recipe for disaster.”\u0026nbspEven before Covid-19, there were concerns about mass disenfranchisement in November the pandemic has only exacerbated them. Donald Trump is already making repeated baseless accusations of voter fraud in what appears to be an effort to lay the foundation for contesting the legitimacy of the 2020 election.Activists were already deeply concerned about the mass closure of polling places and the Covid-19 pandemic has given election officials justification for doing so. More than 1,600 polling places in jurisdictions previously covered by the Voting Rights Act were closed between 2012 and 2018, according to a report by the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights. That includes 214 polling places in Georgia.Democrats and voting rights groups are also pushing states across the country to extend the deadline by which absentee ballots need to arrive to be counted. Many states require the ballots to arrive by election night, a cutoff that could leave eligible voters disenfranchised. In Wisconsin, Democrats secured a court order requiring the state to count ballots as long as they were postmarked before election day and arrived within six days of the election.There is also growing concern about plummeting voter registration in recent months and an unprecedented Republican effort to monitor the polls and challenge the eligibility of voters who appear, something that could result in voter intimidation. The Republican National Committee, freed from a decades-old court order prohibiting them from such activity, is seeking to recruit up to 50,000 volunteers.The window for states to understand the problems from their primaries and implement solutions for November is rapidly closing. Recommended deadlines for purchasing necessary equipment and other measures are approaching and in some cases have already passed. Republicans in Congress have also scaled back funding to help states run elections, allocating just $400m so far, a small fraction of the billions experts say is needed. The Republican National Committee also plans to spend at least $20m to oppose efforts to expand vote by mail.“If no one, legislatorsadvocatesvoterselection officials, listens to what is being said it will be a debacle in November,” Tammy Patrick, who works on election administration at the Democracy Fund, said in an email. “The primaries have been the canary in the coalmine.”\u0026nbspBut other signs suggest states may move in the opposite direction. In Georgia, Brad Raffensperger, the state’s top election official, refused to acknowledge systemic problems in the way the election was run this week, instead blaming local election officials. In Iowa, Republicans are considering legislation that would prohibit the secretary of state, Paul Pate, from sending absentee ballot applications to all voters, something Pate, a Republican, did ahead of the state’s June primary when there was record turnout. Ohio Republicans are also considering legislation that would bar the state’s top election official from paying for postage on absentee ballot requests and the ballots themselves.“On the one hand, it’s very concerning,” said Amber McReynolds, CEO of the National Vote at Home Institute, which is advising election officials on how to prepare for November. “On the other, what I would say is that this is a wake-up call.”\u0026nbspStacey Abrams, the 2018 Democratic nominee in Georgia who put voting rights at the core of her campaign, said some states were better positioned for November “because those states have an intention of actually letting every person vote”.“It is not that we don’t know the answer. It is that the Republican party in particular has been resistant to solving the problem and that will put our elections in jeopardy,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/89fa263f3a83892940314c51fe44e5978e33c284/0_232_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2d7f8a39690b25e0114d960dcef0b513","title":"anthony fauci second wave coronavirus cases","story":"US public health expert said another wave of infections ‘not inevitable ... if you approach it the proper way’Leading US public health expert and White House coronavirus taskforce member Dr Anthony Fauci has said the US may not see a “second wave” of cases of Covid-19.According to researchers at Johns Hopkins University in Maryland, the US has recorded more than 2m cases of Covid-19 and nearly 115,000 deaths.Many experts fear attempts to reopen shuttered state economies and mass protests over police brutality and structural racism could contribute to a second surge in cases.But Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases who has been sidelined by the White House since April, after breaking with Donald Trump’s position on reopening the economy, told CNN on Friday increases in cases in several states were not necessarily indicative of a “second spike” of infections.“When you start to see increases in hospitalisation, that’s a surefire situation that you’ve got to pay close attention to,” Fauci said.“It is not inevitable that you will have a so-called ‘second wave’ in the fall, or even a massive increase if you approach it in the proper way,” he added, advising people to maintain social distancing and to continue to wear masks in public.In the past week, 19 states including Texas, South Carolina, Utah, Arizona, North Carolina, Arkansas, Alabama, Oregon, California, Nevada and Florida have reported seven-day rolling average highs for new Covid-19 infections.In Arkansas on Friday, for example, Governor Asa Hutchinson, a Republican, announced a record number of cases in the previous 24 hours. In Oregon, Governor Kate Brown, a Democrat, placed a seven-day hold on lifting on loosening social restrictions.In Maryland, Baltimore announced that it would not be moving into phase two of planned reopening.In a statement, the mayor, Bernard Young, said: “Let me be crystal clear with everyone: I, more than almost anyone, would love to see that Baltimore city is open and safe, but that simply is not what the data is telling us at this time.”The CDC said it could it not confirm reports of striking increases in coronavirus hospitalisations but would monitor the numbers “very closely”.Such developments sent stock markets into a tailspin on Thursday, before a slight recovery on Friday.Some experts, meanwhile, have become more optimistic that a vaccine for Covid-19 can be developed swiftly.“I think the science is on our side,” the former CDC director Julie Gerberding told CNN.But she cautioned: “That doesn’t say anything about the speed, the safety and the durability and all of the other criteria that have to come into play before we have something that we can count on to give us that population immunity.”In New York City, mass protests have sparked fears of a resurgence of the virus in the American pandemic center. But new infections are now at the lowest level in the entire US.“We were the No 1 state in terms of infection … and now we are the last state in terms of rate of transmission,” New York’s governor, Andrew Cuomo, said on Friday. “That is because New Yorkers stepped up. They were smart. They were disciplined. They did what they had to do, and we need to stay there.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e39d618e5cb6bd602ffdecf5d1b53ae6d83e0a15/0_189_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6e3aadf7bf44555349814a00226bf4ce","title":"beijing china new covid 19 cases linked to food market","story":"Dozens of domestically transmitted cases at city’s largest wholesale food market prompt moveParts of Beijing have reimposed lockdown measures after a cluster of locally transmitted coronavirus cases emerged nearly two months after the Chinese capital appeared to have stamped out the virus.The outbreak, linked to a major wholesale food market, raised serious questions about the challenges of keeping the disease at bay, even in countries such as China where authoritarian rule allows harsh containment regulations and invasive tracing systems.The first case in the new outbreak was discovered on Thursday after a 52-year old man tested positive, prompting the district where he lives to raise its risk level to medium.Beijing had previously gone 55 days in which the only new infections were citizens returning from other countries. The city had largely returned to normal life, with restaurants and shops opening and daily rush-hour traffic resuming.As it became clear there were dozens of cases, mostly linked to the Xinfadi food market, there was an abrupt reversal. Southern Fengtai district, where the market is located, has more than 2 million residents, and 11 residential compounds and several schools near the market have been closed.Movement restrictions were also brought back across the capital, sports events were suspended, tourism from other parts of the country barred and plans to reopen primary schools put on hold.The new infections sparked a panic about salmon, which was pulled from supermarkets around the country after cutting boards used to prepare imported salmon were among surfaces that tested positive for the virus. Fish cannot be infected by coronavirus.Six new domestic infections were reported on Saturday, three workers at the Xinfadi market, two people who had visited and a work colleague of one of the visitors.Officials have quarantined 139 close contacts of people infected. The marketis closed and surrounded by military and police on 24-hour watch. More than 10,000 people who work there will now be tested.“In accordance with the principle of putting the safety of the masses and health first, we have adopted lockdown measures for the Xinfadi market and surrounding neighbourhoods,” said Chu Junwei, a district official. The district is in a “wartime emergency mode”, he said.Underlining government concerns, volunteers were going door to door in distant parts of the city on Saturday asking if anyone had visited the Xinfadi market recently. There will be mass testing of anyone who has been there since the end of May."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/304c93d315a69b2d133f6552711bafa60bf66c98/0_141_4752_2852/master/4752.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=533e705678e6068bd49b521e9c2c47a9","title":"censoring old films and tv shows misses the point say bame leaders","story":"Critics warn that ‘panic-erasing’ distracts from what really matters: employing more ethnic minorities on and off screenThe drive to improve representation of black and minority ethnic people on television has new urgency in the light of the Black Lives Matter protests, but it threatens to be derailed, some supporters argue, by an “idiotic” focus on removing the former work of popular entertainers such as Matt Lucas or Ant and Dec.While the decision of television platforms to remove “vintage” entertainment shows, including Little Britain, The Mighty Boosh and The Dukes of Hazzard, has made headlines, a few leading BAME campaigners claim that retrospective censorship is a distraction.A selection of offending shows have been dropped from archive streaming services including Netflix, UKTV, Britbox and BBC iPlayer, due to their use of “blackface” for comedic effect or because of racist attitudes ascribed to the characters. But writers Ayesha Hazarika and Sathnam Sanghera have both argued on social media that the “panic-erasing” of embarrassing programmes is not a substitute for commissioning BAME talent.“This stuff is idiotic, and it will make the deep concern behind BLM seem like political correctness,” wrote Sanghera, author of a new book about the British imperial legacy, EmpireLand, out next year.Both writers were responding to a UKTV decision, since reversed, to remove a well-known episode of the John Cleese comedy Fawlty Towers, The Germans, that features racist and xenophobic characters.Today, the director of the arts organisation Black Cinema House, Jacqueline Stewart, called for audiences to continue to watch Gone with the Wind, the David O’Selznick film of Margaret Mitchell’s saga of the southern states of America. HBO has removed the film temporarily to provide educational context. Stewart, a professor of cinema studies at the University of Chicago, said it was “precisely because of the ongoing, painful patterns of racial injustice and disregard for black lives that Gone with the Wind should stay in circulation and remain available for analysis and discussion”.It is, she added, a prime text for examining expressions of white supremacy in popular culture, and illustrates how “trenchant racism has restricted black possibilities”.For Lemn Sissay, the British poet and writer, the removal of offending TV shows has been welcome because he believes that, like the statues now toppled or under threat around Britain, they still shore up racist values that should not be tolerated.“I spent my childhood grimacing through shows like It Ain’t Half Hot Mum and Love Thy Neighbour and even Rising Damp. Yes, all those nation-uniting, ‘event television’ comedies. Then I would go to school and hear those exact phrases spat at me with the justification that they ‘were on telly last night’,” Sissay told the Observer.Armando Iannucci, the writer and director behind tv shows The Thick of It and Veep, called for the current enforced shutdown of the entertainment industry to be used to reboot the entire sector, giving much more work to BAME people on and off the screen after lockdown.“It’s now and in the future where this will be resolved, so we’ve got to think about what we do once TV production opens up,” Iannucci told the Observer. “It’s up to directors, casting directors, producers and commissioners to cast from 100 per cent of the acting talent available to us. I’d hate to see more stories of amazing actors having to go to America to get a decent part. “And the thing is, this doesn’t cost, it doesn’t require training, schemes, bursaries, investment (though all that is always welcome) it just requires looking at the fabulous amount of acting talent that’s out there.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/37e0ceb8f49beaaddc9f83ff78e29f4849fb8964/0_171_3300_1980/master/3300.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0047fe3ecb8e33ede382bbcfb079bc1c","title":"mass graves found in libyan town recaptured from khalifa hafter forces","story":"Fears grow of further atrocities in areas controlled by Khalifa Haftar forcesThe UN secretary general, António Guterres, has expressed deep shock at the discovery of mass graves in Libyan territory recently recaptured from forces commanded by Khalifa Haftar, and called for a transparent investigation.Guterres also called on Libya’s UN-backed government to secure the mass graves, identify the victims, establish the causes of death and return the bodies to the next of kin. He offered UN support in carrying out the measures, his spokesman Stéphane Dujarric said.“The secretary general once again reminds all parties to the conflict in Libya of their obligations under international humanitarian law and international human rights law,” Dujarric said.The UN said earlier on Friday that at least eight mass graves had been discovered, mostly in the town of Tarhuna, a key western town that served as a stronghold for Haftar’s forces in their 14-month campaign to capture the capital, Tripoli.The discoveries have raised fears about the extent of human rights violations in territories controlled by Haftar’s forces, given the difficulties of documentation in an active war zone.Philippe Nassif, Amnesty International’s director for the Middle East and North Africa, said the group was working to verify the mass killings.“We want to be able to go in, or have the UN go in, and collect evidence of potential war crimes and other atrocities ... so eventually a process takes place where justice can be served,” he said.Militias allied to the UN-backed government in Tripoli recaptured Tarhuna, about 65 km (41 miles) south-east of the Libyan capital, last week – the latest in a string of battlefield successes that reversed most of Haftar’s gains. The government said earlier that it had regained control of all of Tripoli’s entrance and exit points and Tripoli airport.Fathi Bashagha, the interior minister in the UN-backed government, said earlier this week that authorities were documenting evidence of alleged war crimes in Tarhuna. He said preliminary reports indicated dozens of victims found in the city’s mass graves had been buried alive.Bashagha also said special investigative teams uncovered a shipping container in Tarhuna full of charred bodies, presumably of detainees, and blamed powerful militias loyal to Haftar for “heinous crimes”. A feared militia called al-Kaniyat, which is allied to Haftar and notorious for its targeting of dissenters, had controlled the town.The US assistant secretary of state for near eastern affairs, David Schenker, told reporters on Thursday he was troubled by reports that Tripoli’s forces had discovered bodies of civilians, land mines and other explosive devices in territory retaken from Haftar’s forces.Libya has been in turmoil since 2011, when a civil war toppled the long-time dictator Muammar Gaddafi, who was later killed. The country has since split between rival administrations in the east and the west, each backed by armed groups and foreign governments.Forces under Haftar launched an offensive to try to take Tripoli in April 2019, and the crisis in the oil-rich country has steadily worsened as foreign backers increasingly intervened despite pledges to the contrary at a high-profile peace summit in Berlin earlier this year.Haftar is supported by France, Russia, Jordan, the United Arab Emirates and other key Arab countries. The government in Tripoli is backed by Turkey — which sent troops and mercenaries to protect the capital in January — as well as Italy and Qatar.The UN political mission in Libya said it had convened meetings with the two warring parties, and Dujarric said Guterres hoped a ceasefire would be agreed soon.Schenker said he sees the escalating proxy war between Russia and Turkey in Libya as a challenge to regional stability and a “tragedy for the Libyan people looking for peace and end to foreign intervention”.Libya is teetering on the brink of a new escalation as Tripoli militias wage a campaign to recapture the coastal town of Sirte, which would provide access to the country’s vast oil fields currently under Haftar’s control. The intensified fighting has forced nearly 24,000 people to flee their homes in the last week, according to UN humanitarian officials.Despite intensified diplomatic activity to bring the sides to the negotiating table, Ankara appears keen to shore up its presence in western Libya. . Turkey’s navy and air force conducted military drills in the Mediterranean off Libya on Thursday, officials said, an apparent show of support for Tripoli.The Turkish military said the drill was meant to test and develop the country’s ability to command and execute long-distance operations. A government official, speaking on condition of anonymity in line with government regulations, said the manoeuvres took place in international waters and airspace.The military said 17 warplanes based in the central Turkish air base of Eskisehir and eight frigates took part in what it called open-sea training. The drill lasted for eight hours and took place along a 1,000 km (625 mile) route from the Turkish coast and back.Turkey’s growing support, including armed drones and thousands of Syrian mercenaries, signals its desire for more leverage in the eastern Mediterranean. Ankara signed a maritime deal last autumn with the Tripoli-based government that would grant it access to an economic zone across the Mediterranean, despite the objections from regional rivals Greece, Cyprus and Egypt. Turkey has said it will begin exploring for natural resources there within months."},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"Students would only be able to attend one or two days a week if rule not changed, says MinisterThe effects of climate change could damage, and possibly even destroy, our collective heritage"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Avian science journal Ibis reports \u0026lsquogreat conservation concern\u0026rsquo about the speciesAnother Life: Dairy farmer Bruce Thompson examines impact of worming drug on beetlesMichael Viney: Crumbling hilltop trig pillars\u0026rsquo played key role in the mapping of IrelandAntipodean flatworms pose risk to indigenous variety which could have severe knock-on effectsAnother Life: Some floaters circle territories and sneak the odd \u0026lsquoextra-pair copulation\u0026rsquoMichael Viney: Plant intelligence rests in the ways by which they solve their problemsA Life on Our Planet is a terrifying catalogue of our self-sabotaging transgressionsGreys carry squirrel-pox virus which is fatal to Ireland\u0026rsquos native redsAnother Life: The disappearance of this bird from cities has prompted much researchRobinson has followed Mair\u0026eacutead, his wife and collaborator, into the list of Covid-19 fatalitiesWill Covid-19 begin a resurgence of the 1970s withdrawal from growth-driven capitalism?Greater industry involvement required if bovine TB to be eliminated by 2030 targetMichael Viney: Camera traps are now used as a regular part of hare monitoringMarine life with very specific habitat needs threatened in the face of sweeping changeThree terrapins as pets seems a bit ambitious considering their needsThe list of causes of damage is long, making it hard to know where to startFew, if any, of Ireland\u0026rsquos mammals have evolved the ability to eat venomous creaturesGolden kelp is notably bare of other sea life, so there are concerns over its possible impactLong-term objective is to see how wildflowers are responding to changes in weather patterns and climateTime to restore meadows once full of insects and nectar in summer and spires of seeds in winterA new report shows no let-up in the loss of wildlife in Northern Ireland"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4270808.1591280343!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"spotted flycatcher is less likely to be spotted with each passing year","story":"Last year it was the mistle thrush that grabbed me – my affectionate attention, that is. Each morning as I marched out to measure the rain, he was perched on the gable’s broadband aerial and facing the sea in a full-flow performance.I’d stand beneath him, carefully still, admiring the measured, forceful phrasing, the avian oratory. His song carries, by some accounts, a couple of kilometres. And at length, his final, territorial peroration concluded, we could both move on.This year there have been distractions, among them the compelling entry of a little bird whose song (“ a few thin hasty notes”, as my field guide allows) is quite lost beyond my double-glazed bedroom window.This looks out to a low-fringed glade of rough grass and shady trees, oak and alder intertwined. For the spotted flycatcher, Muscicapa striata, it is the perfect arena for the ceaseless, urgent practice of his name.Many birds catch insects in the air – our swallows are at it all the time – but none behaves quite like the flycatcher.He chooses a perch on a twig with a view – it can become a daily favourite – and makes repeated, looping forays to seize his prey. The energy involved is impressive: a flurry of wings in a ing take-off, an arrow-swift glide to snap up the target, an instant turn and flurry of wings to propel him back to his original parch.This manoeuvre, made over and over at different trajectories and distances and flashing in the sun, kept catching my eye as I lay reading in bed, the mammoth third volume from Hilary Mantel propped up on a beanbag. Distracted from Thomas Cromwell’s devious doings at Henry’s court, I gave way to tracking the flycatcher’s own, quite hypnotic, manoeuvres.Rare visitorIt was the first such visitor in many years, migrating from a humid zone of west Africa by way of northern Spain. As perhaps the last of the summer’s arrivals in Ireland, what chance had drawn it to this one wooded acre on a sheep-shorn coastal hillside?Here in a gloom-laden west, last summer offered few flying insects: even the midges lay low. The contrast this year, boosted by the sun, just about sustains the bird’s hard work, together with the swoops of the swallows. Despite its name, mere flies are mostly for chicks in the nest, somewhere in a shadowy crevice. But the energy for ceaseless interception demands meatier fare – butterflies, moths, craneflies, damselflies, even bees or wasps, their stings scraped off on the twig.To read about birds these days is to expect more tales of decline. The British Trust for Ornithology reports an 89 per cent reduction in spotted flycatchers between 1967 and 2010. Ibis, the international journal of avian science, has added “great conservation concern” about the species.In Ireland, a new survey of countryside birds suggests a continuing fall in breeding flycatchers, perhaps of a quarter over the past couple of decades, and notably in the east midlands. Theories include predation of nests, perhaps even by grey squirrels, but other migrants from the flycatcher’s winter habitats in Africa have suffered severe declines, so bigger answers may lie there, in climate change or deforestation.Measuring lossThe Countryside Bird Survey is important and readable. Co-ordinated by BirdWatch Ireland, it’s the product of thousands of hours of fieldwork, mainly by volunteers, but also by the National Parks and Wildlife Service, which publishes it online (npws.ie) as Irish Wildlife Manual 115. It tracks the fortunes of the common and widespread breeding birds between 1998 and 2016. That this now excludes the lapwing and curlew, from the difficulty of finding them, is a measure of their loss.The survey does correct a few popular notions about the loss of birds, not least my own casual belief that Ireland’s cuckoos shared in the UK’s long patterns of decline. “Perhaps surprisingly, in light of at least anecdotal evidence,” says the report, “the CBS shows a positive population trend of nearly 19 per cent.”On average, cuckoos have been recorded in 74 of the survey’s spread of 1km squares per year. These could certainly, this spring, have included our own hillside. One (or more?) cuckoos has been giving forth, almost non-stop through late May, to the weaker, counterpoint chorus from collared doves.One day I watched as a cuckoo, harried by a little mob of pipits, took refuge in the crest of the old Sitka spruce at our gate. She re-emerged from the dark canopy almost immediately and fled stage-left, still pursued by pipits. She may, of course, have met the mistle thrush’s mate, indignantly at home on the nest."},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Photograph: Laura HuttonLast week was the first since the start of March in which Dublin had fewer than 100 weekly cases of Covid-19 diagnosed, the Central Statistics Office has confirmed.In its fourth bulletin on Covid-19 insights, the CSO said there were 54 new cases in Co Dublin\u0026nbspin the week ending June 5th, down from a peak of 1,869 cases in the week ending March 27th.Elsewhere, positive trends in relation to new case growth continued in several largely rural counties.The deaths of a further three people diagnosed with Covid-19 were reported in the Republic on Friday.This brings the total number of fatalities in the country to 1,705.The National Public Health Emergency Team also recorded a further 13 confirmed cases of coronavirus, bringing the total number of cases in the country since the pandemic began to 25,250.One death was denotified by the Health Protection Surveillance Centre. The new totals reflect this.Cities continue to account for an outsized proportion of total Covid-19 infections, with 44 per cent of all cases occurring in urban areas which account for one-third of the population. Dublin continues to be worst affected in terms of deaths, with 11 in the last week. It is the only county to record more than five new deaths each week for the past four weeks.Clare, Leitrim, Longford, Tipperary, Wexford and Wicklow have all recorded fewer than 10 new cases for the fourth week in a row, while Donegal, Laois and Kerry recorded fewer than 10 new cases for the fifth week in a row.Almost 90 per cent of Covid-19 patients who required intensive care had an underlying condition.The CSO found that the median age of those admitted to Intensive Care Units (ICUs), 60, was in fact lower than the median age of those admitted to hospitals. The peak of admissions to ICU was in the week ending March 27th, when 94 new cases were admitted, the CSO said.However, the CSO data supports the wider experience that the virus proves most deadly for elderly people, with the median age of all deaths associated with Covid-19 coming in at 83.So far, 413 people have required treatment in ICUs. Of all those who were hospitalised, 62 per cent had an underlying condition, but 87 per cent of those in intensive care suffered from one. Men significantly outnumber women in terms of ICU admissions, accounting for 68 per cent of the total.Meanwhile, the Health Service Executive has spent an additional €400 million on Covid-19 related costs so far, and is projecting a possible €1.8 billion cost for treating the disease to the end of the year.The biggest drivers of cost are personal protective equipment (PPE) and testing and tracing, according to HSE chief executive Paul Reid.As a result of the extra spending, the cost base of next year’s HSE service plan will be significantly increased, he warned.Mr Reid said the cost of PPE, which is expected to be about €1 billion this year, had been driven by the massive premium that had to be paid for scarce equipment and the cost of supplying large volumes to the “HSE family” and beyond, to the wider healthcare system.Next year’s winter plan would be very different from this year’s, he said, and the HSE corporate plan would also have to be redesigned.Services need to be redesigned, sustainable models of primary care and the provision of elective care has to be addressed, Mr Reid said.Time-frames for plans would have to be “recalibrated” from existing 10-year s, and capacity will have to be built to cope with the “new reality” of post Covid-19 healthcare.“We’re winning so far but it’s a long game,” Mr Reid said of the performance of the health service, “but now we have to develop new plans within the HSE to deliver services in a different way”.Testing turnaroundThe turnaround time for testing has significantly improved, Mr Reid said. End-to-end turnaround from the time a person reports symptoms to a result is now a median of 1.8 days, down from two days the previous week.For tests processed in hospital labs, the turnaround time is 1.5 days in the community, the average time is 2.3 days.Some 86 per cent of tests are processed end-to-end within three days, just short of the 90 per cent target.Last week, 1,500 calls were made as part of the contact-tracing operation, and 255 close contacts were sent for testing. Of these, 14 tested positive, and 90 per cent of this group were asymptomatic.“Many thousands of lives” were saved through social distancing, lockdown measures, proper hand hygiene and respiratory etiquette, intensive care consultant Dr Catherine Motherway said.Despite starting with a low number of critical care beds by international standards, hospitals were able to treat all patients needing care and were at no point overwhelmed.The crude mortality rate of those who were admitted to intensive care was 20 per cent, which compares quite well internationally, she said. Ninety-nine per cent had underlying conditions.However, next winter will be “difficult” so it was vital to recruit critical care nurses and create new capacity, she said. Ultimately, critical care capacity needed to be doubled.There are currently 226 patients in hospital with confirmed or suspected Covid-19, including 32 in intensive care.Some 734 beds in hospitals are free, including 91 in intensive care, according to HSE chief operations officer Anne O’Connor.The future of the Citywest isolation facility, where just 16 patients are being cared for by 21 staff, was being considered in the context of the winter plan, she said.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4277638.1591974944!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"government considers making face masks a condition of travel on public transport","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Leo Varadkar said he would prefer to rely on the willingness of Irish people to comply with guidelines on masks rather than to go into a situation where people were being ordered to comply. Photograph: Brian LawlessPA WireThe Government is exploring the possibility of making face masks compulsory on public transport.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said on Friday that work is being done to see if wearing masks can be “a condition of travel on public transport”.He said that achieving that was not entirely straightforward as there were public transport bylaws, health laws and other considerations.He said there were pluses and minuses to making the wearing of masks mandatory. He said they were not suitable for children under 13, or those with breathing difficulties, or for some with disabilities.He said the Government had given very strong advice they should be worn in places with restricted space and on public transport. He said he would prefer to rely on the willingness of Irish people to comply with guidelines rather than to go into a situation where people were being ordered to comply.“I really don’t want to be into a position where we are fining or prosecuting people for not wearing face masks.“We ask people to follow public health advice.“If you are on public transport wear a mask for face covering,” he said.The Cabinet is also considering partially lifting the 14-day quarantine period for people arriving into Ireland from countries where the coronavirus is under control on June 29th.Mr Varadkar has previously raised the prospect of opening up such air corridors or air bridges, which would effectively allow Irish people to go on foreign holidays to certain countries.It is understood the initial phase would only apply to European Union countries.While a decision was not expected to be taken by the Cabinet during its meeting on Friday, it is understood a memo to the meeting envisaged the quarantine period for such countries would be dropped when Phase 3 of the Covid-19 restrictions starts on June 29th.On Thursday, Mr Varadkar said Ireland might be almost fully open by the middle of July, rather than the middle of August. He told the Dáil the positivity rate in tests for coronavirus was less than 1 per cent, down from a peak of 20 per cent.Nursing home visitsEarlier on Friday, chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan said people might be able to visit relatives in nursing homes from next week.Nursing homes have been given guidance and advice on allowing visitors and should be in a position to implement that advice from next week he told RTÉ radio’s Morning Ireland.The scale of deaths in care home settings in the Republic was at the lower end when compared with the experience of other European countries, he said, adding Ireland was being compared with countries that had not reported Covid-19 deaths as comprehensively.Dr Holohan also said the clarity of communication on the wearing of face coverings needed to be stepped up. A campaign was being unveiled to advise the public on the importance of wearing face coverings on public transport, in shops and in places where physical distancing was difficult to maintain.To date, there had been a very high level of compliance by the public, and the virus had been suppressed, but face coverings were just one measure on which there should be more focus, he said.There had been a decrease in the level of transmission with each person who was infected passing it on to fewer people, he added.If there was a resurgence of the virus, Dr Holohan said he would not propose restrictions like those introduced in March because comparisons could be made by looking at the experiences of other countries and the population’s behaviour. “We would know what specific measures to take.”As other countries had eased restrictions, there had been downward trends of rates of transmission across most European countries, he added.Earlier on Newstalk Breakfast, Dr Holohan had warned that people should not become complacent while wearing face masks.“One of things we do have concern about is that if people feel if they wear a mask, it’s a little bit like a hurling helmet – are you going to put yourself in more danger when you have a helmet on because you feel a little bit more invincible.”He said it was important people did not think like that. Face masks were an added measure on top of other measures that were important such as hand hygiene and physical distancing.Dr Holohan said that when he visited his local Dunnes Stores he wore a face mask. “I don’t particularly like doing it myself, if I’m very honest with you.”On the issue of working from home, Dr Holohan urged anyone who can work from home to continue to do so. “People shouldn’t drift back to work on the basis that they’re now coming back to the office because the risk of this has receded.Ireland has “almost zero” new cases of Covid-19 and all indicators of the disease are either stable or declining, three weeks into the easing of restrictions, public-health officials have said.Vowing to “go as low as we possibly can” towards eliminating the disease, Dr Holohan said he did not believe there were hidden clusters “out there”, separate from the small number of daily cases now being reported.The National Public Health Emergency Team will meet next Thursday to finalise advice to Government on the “rephasing” of the easing of restrictions.Its recommendations are expected to provide further clarity on a variety of issues, including a possible easing of the two-metre social-distancing rule, the reopening of hairdressers, rules around weddings and the reopening of the offshore islands.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Men being treated in hospital for injuries to their neck, thigh and chest in PoitiersGarda\u0026rsquos home in Dundalk was petrol bombed on Sunday, June 7thFF, FG and Greens close to reaching agreement on coalitionHolohan says indicators show disease is \u0026lsquostable or reducing\u0026rsquoGallagher family prepare to mark 25th anniversary of Irish blues guitarist\u0026rsquos passingResident who went into self-isolation in mid-March was not tested until mid-AprilMinister wants schools opened fully in September using \u0026lsquoclass bubbles\u0026rsquo\u0026lsquoIkea of sport\u0026rsquo has spent \u0026euro13 million on its flagship store in BallymunCian English (19) fell to his death when he was allegedly being robbed at knife-pointLimerick garda\u0026iacute detain man and woman after operations on Friday and SaturdayGarda\u0026iacute describe incident as \u0026lsquotragic accident\u0026rsquoMan in his 20s arrested in connection with incident on Saturday morningDecrease in assaults, threats to murder and harassment since March, figures showThe community taxi service is back on the city\u0026rsquos streets \u0026ndash but with reduced capacityNumber of water schemes at drought levels has increased from 27 to 30 despite recent rainFrustration mounts around final sign-off of programme for government\u0026rsquos exact textPrincipal responds as racist video made by girls from Our Lady\u0026rsquos Bower resurfacesDr Peter Boylan criticises \u0026lsquoshambles\u0026rsquo of plans to move to St Vincent\u0026rsquos under Nicky KearnsTeachers\u0026rsquo unions concerned at full-time return via \u0026lsquoclass bubble\u0026rsquo instead of social distancingWarning comes after news of Daniel Kinahan\u0026rsquos role in organising major boxing matchStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4276600.1591879762!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"he needs to be allowed to come home irish man detained in china for 15 months","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe wife of the Irish businessman who is barred from  leaving China   met with Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney but says she has had no further feedback since the initial meeting. Photograph:     Pavel GolovkinAPThe wife of a Dublin businessman barred from leaving China for 15 months has made a direct appeal to the Irish Government to intervene and push for his release.Tara O’Halloran said her husband Richard has been largely confined to a hotel since an exit ban was imposed on him, the first of its kind in China against an Irish citizen.Speaking publicly about her husband’s detention for the first time, Ms O’Halloran said he has been caught up in complicated events that pre-date his time in the aviation leasing company he works for. She fears for his physical and mental health, and the risks he faces during the coronavirus pandemic given that he suffers from a lung condition.AccusedMr O’Halloran has been blocked from leaving the country over an investigation into Chinese businessman Min Jiedong, owner of Dublin-based China International Aviation Leasing Service (CIALS), the firm the Irish man works for, concerning peer-to-peer lending and crowd-funding.The authorities have accused Mr Min of illegally collecting money from the Chinese public in a crowd-funding scheme and using it to buy an aircraft, currently leased to an airline in Europe.Mr O’Halloran, who joined the company a year after the events under investigation, travelled to China in February 2019 to meet investors and assess the problems facing the firm. After a week of meetings in Shanghai, he was detained at passport control at the airport as he tried to board his flight back to Dublin. He was later issued with an exit ban.The businessman, a relative of former Fine Gael taoiseach Garret FitzGerald, has testified as a witness four times in the prosecution of Mr Min. However, he has not been permitted to leave China despite both the prosecutor and Mr Min telling the court he should be.The Chinese authorities argue that Mr O’Halloran promised to transfer the aircraft and leasing revenues connected to the plane back to the Irish company’s Chinese parent but has not done so.“Under this circumstance, Mr O’Halloran is restricted from leaving China by law,” the Chinese embassy in Dublin said in a statement.The embassy said the Chinese police and court are “actively investigating and handling the case of CIALS in order to protect the property rights and interests of the victims involved in the case.“It is hoped that Mr O’Halloran co-operates positively with the local authorities in Shanghai to bring this case to a successful conclusion at an early date,” it said.Ms O’Halloran says her husband is being asked to do something he cannot do under Irish law. “It is not possible . . . it is entirely out of his hands.”Ms O’Halloran says he has co-operated with the authorities in China and that it was “a matter for the authorities to bring matters to a speedy conclusion and to allow Richard to return home to his family”.FrustratedAfter an initial meeting with Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney and contacts with his department, Ms O’Halloran says the family have had no further feedback.“So far they have just paid lip service. My children want their dad back,” she says.She has been frustrated seeing the department helping bring others home.“With the Covid-19 pandemic, I see them repatriating everybody else from all over the world to come back to Ireland to be safe, yet they can’t get Richard home. He needs their help.”A spokeswoman for the Department of Foreign Affairs said: “We are aware of the case and are providing consular assistance. We do not comment on the details of inidual consular cases.”Ms O’Halloran said her husband missed the death of her mother in January, “nearly two lots of birthdays” and other important family occasions.His long absence has badly affected their four children, Ben (13), Amber (11), Isabella (eight) and Scarlett (six) who sleeps with a framed photo of her father.“It is very difficult for them to understand because we don’t know when he is coming home or even if, at this stage,” she says.Ms O’Halloran says her husband is permitted to leave his hotel but she fears the virus would “kill him” if he contracted it. He largely confines himself to his hotel room.“It has definitely taken a huge toll mentally and emotionally. It is horrific.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4278729.1592059324!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"queuing for sport decathlon opens first outlet in republic with boundless enthusiasm","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSome of those queuing outside Decathlon’s new outlet in Ballymun Dublin on Saturday. Photograph: Ronan McGreevy If only queuing was a sport, Decathlon might add to its list of accessories, along with the 72 other sports it caters for in its Ballymun flagship store.The spectacle of Irish people patiently and, of course, socially distancing in queues has become commonplace in recent days. We could enter a team in the Olympic games and stand a chance of winning a gold medal.And we have had plenty of practice lately - when you have been locked down for months, maybe even queuing seems like an interesting activity.By the time Decathlon opened its doors at 10.30am there were upwards of 500 people waiting outside forming a line around the outside of the building and through the indoor football pitch which will open in the coming weeks along with the basketball court, the outdoor gym, the climbing wall and the cycling track. This is one shop that parents will not have to drag their children to.People clapped and cheered, and that was just the staff who came out a few minutes before opening time to greet the early arrivals. Then, inside, they clapped the first 150 customers through the door.Decathlon’s English-born manager Kieran O’Shea waved his arms about to ratchet up the enthusiasm level. He says the company looks for “vitality and responsibility” more than anything in its staff.His name comes from his Irish-born grandfather. “I hope I’m doing him proud. He would be here today but for Covid-19 restrictions,” he said.You would think the 67 employees owned the place and to a certain extent they do, explained the company’s Irish chief executive Bastien Grandgeorge as they all have shares in Decathlon.He said Decathlon is here to stay in Ireland as they have bought, not leased, the site in Ballymun, investing €13 million in the 4,000 square metre store. “I know. I spent the money,” he added.It as a three-year project to open its first shop in the Republic, which was due to be completed in April, but the opening was postponed because of the Covid-19 pandemic.Decathlon is called the “Ikea of sports” and its location beside Ikea is no accident. Decathlon is betting that, having spend hours in one vast windowless retail emporium, the enthusiasm of customers will not be dimmed for another one next door.Decathlon has also borrowed many of Ikea’s techniques from - it designs and sells its own equipment, piling it high and selling it cheap.Prices too are competitive, bicycles from €250, six man tents for €150, rowing machines for €150 (already sold out) and footballs for €5.Almost everything in stock is own-brand so customers looking for club football shirts or branded runners, the biggest sellers in other sports shops, will have to look elsewhere.Reese Doyle from Ballyfermot decided to come on a whim and was well pleased with his Triban hybrid bicycle which cost €260. “I was inside my house today and I said I had nothing else to do. I haven’t had a bike in about 10 years. I need one for work. I can’t rely on the buses,” he said reflecting the views of many people who are now switching from public transport to cycling.Michelle Kueirozdesa, a Brazilian native, was first in the queue. She arrived with two friends before 8am. “We thought they were going to open at 9am, but it was good to get here early. We are looking for some weights and stuff like this.”Karen Wright arrived just before 8am with her daughter Noorsalem (11) to buy equestrian gear.“We live locally. It’s wonderful that a whole new generation of people will associate Ballymun with something so positive,” she saidDecathlon has big plans for Ireland. It plans to open new outlets in Cork and Galway with a view to opening a total of between six and nine shops in the Republic of Ireland, in addition to the outlet it already operates in Northern Ireland.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4277697.1591993545!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ucd professor asked to resign from eu committee over covid 19 claims","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tProf Dolores Cahill claimed people who recover from Covid-19 are ‘immune for life’ after 10 days. Photograph: Nick BradshawThe A University College Dublin (UCD) professor, who chairs the Eurosceptic Irish Freedom Party, has been asked to resign from a leading European Union scientific committee over online claims she made about the Covid-19 pandemic.In an hour-long interview with a popular alt-right activist on May 10th, which has been viewed hundreds of thousands of times, Prof Dolores Cahill promised to “debunk the narrative” of the pandemic.Lockdown and social distancing is not needed to stop the spread of the virus, she said. People who recover are then “immune for life” after 10 days and deaths and illnesses could have been prevented by extra vitamins, she claimed.People with underlying health conditions, such as cystic fibrosis, could freely engage in society during the pandemic after spending a few weeks building up their immunity in this manner, she went on.Opposing vaccinations, Ms Cahill said “politicians and the media” are using Covid-19 “as a fear-mongering propaganda tool to try and take away rights from people and to make them more sick and to force vaccinations on us.”However, the European Commission said the claims made by Ms Cahill, a professor of translational medicine in UCD, could cause “significant harm”, if taken literally.‘Not compatible’Following this, Ms Cahill was asked to resign as vice chair of the Scientific Committee of the Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI), a partnership between the European Commission and the drugs industry to promote new drugs.“Professor Cahill has been requested by the Chair of the Scientific Council of IMI and the Executive Director of IMI to step down from her function,” the commission told The .“While as a private person, Professor Cahill is entitled to express her points of view, these are not compatible with the scientific foundations of the Innovative Medicines Initiative,” said a Commission spokesperson.Ms Cahill’s claims have also caused Berlin’s Max Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics (MPIMG), where she worked for eight years, to distance itself, saying it did not want to be associated in any way with the claims made.The IMI echoed these sentiments, saying that they were “shocked” to see her statements and that her views do not reflect those hold on Covid-19 by of IMI.A former Max Planck colleague, Prof Hans Lehrach said he was “really surprised” by Ms Cahill’s comments: “I have no idea why she says things like that,” he said.“There is absolutely no proof that people recovering from the disease are immune for life,” he said, reflecting the World Health Organisation’s understanding on the subject.Vitamins and minerals do help the immune system, but Mr Lehrach said he would “very much doubt” that they would defend against the virus. The vulnerable would be “pretty insane” to engage widely during the pandemic.Hydroxychloroquine treatmentMs Cahill also supported the use of hydroxychloroquine to treat Covid-19, one that has been supported, too, by US president Donald Trump. The drug, she said, is “safe and effective” in treating the disease.However, Prof Lehrach said that he would be “very careful” with hydroxychloroquine as testing had proven that it is ineffective as a treatment and has been known to cause death due to heart complications.The original interview has since been removed by YouTube, but versions can still be found easily online and have clocked up hundreds of thousands of views. Ms Cahill has given a number of similar interviews since.Ms Cahill is a member of the faculty at UCD school of medicine, where she is the module co-ordinator on a number of subjects, including one taught to first-year medicine students called Science Medicine and Society.When approached for comment, UCD confirmed that she is part of the university’s faculty, but refused to comment further on her claims, saying only that they are “her own views”.Ms Cahill unsuccessfully contested the general election for the Irish Freedom Party in February, eliminated on the second count in Tipperary with a total of 527 votes. She has not replied to requests for comment.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4278735.1592076540!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ff fg and greens carve up taoiseach s 11 nominees to seanad","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe 11 appointed senators are known as ‘the Taoiseach’s 11’.The break-down is akin to a soccer team formation - four, four, two and one - for the 11 Senators to be appointed to make up the Seanad’s full complement of 60. The 11 are known as “the Taoiseach’s 11”.Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil are expected to choose four Senators each while the Green Party will get to decide two nominees and the three parties will agree a Northern Ireland representative.Nominating a northerner is a long-held but intermittent tradition. In the main they have been unionist voices including peace activist Gordon Wilson, retired doctor John Robb and writer Sam McAughtry but have also included former SDLP deputy first leader Séamus Mallon who served briefly in 1982 and former Northern Ireland Ombudsman Maurice Hayes.Mentioned in dispatches is Derry woman Emma De Souza who won a political and legal battle to ensure Northern Ireland citizens will be regarded as EU citizens for immigration and family unification purposes.She rejected a British Home office requirement that she must renounce British citizenship before being able to rely on rights to Irish citizens in the Belfast Agreement to seek residence rights for her US-born husband.Also in contention is unionist and former president of the Ulster Farmers’ Union Ian Marshall who won a Seanad byelection in 2018 with cross-party backing including that of Sinn Féin but was unsuccessful in the Seanad general election.After that it will be a nightmarish task to pick nominees for the Seanad from hundreds of applicants.Fine Gael had an embarrassing Seanad election when no women won seats and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar pledged that most if not all of the party’s nominees will be female.However there is speculation former TD Noel Rock who lost his Dublin North West seat may be the one male selection. Some in the party oppose his preferment, demonstrated in his poor showing in the Seanad election. The colourful politician lost his seat in part because the constituency boundary changed and there are no party councillors there now but critics say it became the Noel Rock rather than the Fine Gael organisation.A Seanad seat “is hers for the asking” according to some sources when asked about Minister for Social Protection Regina Doherty who lost her Dáil seat. But she is also mentioned as a frontrunner for the powerful role of party general secretary when incumbent Tom Curran retires.Cllr Mary Seery Kearney based in Templeogue Dublin is expected to get the nod for the Seanad to build a profile to win back a Dublin South-Central seat.Cllr Aisling Dolan who performed well in the Seanad election is also on the radar for Roscommon-Galway where there is no Fine Gael TD.Some have mentioned Salthill Cllr Clodagh Higgins a sister of former Labour senator Lorraine Higgins while a further prospect is Castlebar Cllr Donna Sheridan after former senator Michelle Mulherrin decided to step back. Meath East Cllr Sharon Tolan who performed well in the Seanad election has also been mentioned.The well regarded former Limerick senator Maria Byrne who lost out in the Seanad election may struggle to be selected with sitting TD Kieran O’Donnell in place in the city.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar is not expected to nominate former high profile TD Kate O’Connell although he has been known to surprise. Critics of the outspoken politician acknowledge that “whether you like or dislike her” she would be an articulate, intelligent and questioning voice for the party in the Upper House.Fianna Fáil has received “tens of dozens” of requests for a prized nomination. All eyes will be on whether former Clare Fianna Fáil TD Timmy Dooley will get the nod after his party colleague Cathal Crowe took the Dáil seat in the county. He also failed to get elected to the Seanad which some attribute in part to his poison chalice role as director of elections in previous Seanad elections.Former Cork South-West TD Margaret Murphy O’Mahony, a staunch campaigner for the disability sector is in the frame while former Louth TD Declan Breathnach has also been mentioned. Both lost their Dáil seats and were unsuccessful in the Seanad election.Long-time Cllr Mary Fitzgerald could be considered for Dublin Central where the party has no TD while Cllr Deirdre Heney polled well in Dublin Bay North and Shay Brennan, son of former minister Séamus Brennan came close to a seat in Dublin Rathdown.Lorraine Clifford-Lee who lost her Seanad seat has been mentioned as the party looks at two seats for Dublin Fingal next time around and it remains to be seen if the well regarded Gerry Horkan can make the final cut after his surprise defeat in the Seanad election.Most Green party sources say look at the election results when it comes to picking a name for a Seanad nominee. The party has a swathe of candidates who got close to the line including popular Kildare North Cllr Vincent P Martin, a brother of deputy leader Catherine Martin.Up and coming Cork City Cllr Lorna Bogue is also seen as in the frame for her Cork South-Central performance, along with colourful Clare Cllr Róisín Garvey.Cllr David Healy was close in Dublin Bay North while long-term Louth Cllr Mark Deary has worked hard to maintain the party’s profile in Louth. A seat for Cllr Peter Kavanagh could help his Dublin Mid-West battle with former high profile Green Paul Gogarty.It remains to be seen if Mayo native Saoirse McHugh who has spoken out against coalition with Fine Gael or Fianna Fáil will get nominated. She secured a high first preference vote in the Seanad election but did not get sufficient transfers to win a seat.Dublin city Cllr Hazel Chu had originally been thought a potential candidate in the Seanad election but could now possibly be the next lord mayor of Dublin.The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":null,"title":"remember brexit it s back and yes there s another impasse","story":"So Brexit is back in the news? Yes. The UK left the EU at the end of last year – so Brexit happened – but negotiations are now under way to try to agree the shape of its future relationship with the EU, particularly on trade. Because the UK entered a transition period after it left the EU not much has actually changed since then, but this is due to run out at the end of the year. The UK said formally on Friday that it would not seek an extension to the transition period – if this was to happen it had to be agreed by the end of June.But there are a few months left for talks still? There are. But the talks so far have made little progress, need to quickly get a new impetus if there is to be any chance of reaching a deal by the end of the year. There is to be an online conference between UK prime minister Boris Johnson and EU leaders on Monday, followed by intensified talks from the end of June. Trade deals are complicated and the EU side will need time to ratify any deal, so we could be heading for a period of drama in the autumn to try to finalise an agreement.What if there is no deal? If there is no deal then the UK leaves the EU trading bloc at the turn of the year. Trade would continue on what are called World Trade Organisation terms, meaning tariffs, which are special import levies, on trade between the EU and UK and a host of new customs procedures and delays. Some of these might apply anyway even if there was a deal, but a no-deal exit from the trading bloc would be more damaging. This would be like the no-deal Brexit we were threatened with at the end of last year, with a big impact on the Irish economy.The UK has said it will give some leeway to goods entering from the EU by not imposing full checks or requiring immediate tariff payments until July of 2021.What about the Irish Border? This is where a departure without a trade deal would be different from the no-deal Brexit feared last year. Under a special protocol agreed as part of the withdrawal agreement, the UK signed up to a new trading arrangement for Northern Ireland designed to avoid the need for Irish border checks and infrastructure, even if no trade deal is completed by the end of this year.How this will work is being agreed by a special committee, and here too there are difficulties. Minister of State for European Affairs Helen McEntee said in the Dáil recently that a recent paper from the UK, while it did provide some clarification, still left a lot of uncertainty in areas like customs, tariffs and VAT checks. Under the agreement, Northern Ireland will continue to follow EU single market rules for goods and will make the necessary checks on goods, food and animals entering the North from Britain. The EU is insisting these checks are full and detailed as there will be no further controls at the Irish Border when they enter the EU single market.What are the implications for Irish business if there is no trade deal concluded? It would be a hit for Irish exporters to the UK, particularly the food sector with McEntee estimating this week that tariffs of €1.35 billion would be imposed on annual Irish food exports to the UK, which are valued at around €5.2 billion. The beef sector, which would face the highest tariffs, would be most exposed and this would feed back to jobs in the Republic, cattle prices and farm incomes. All goods exporters and importers trading with the UK would face costly new procedures and potential delays. New tariffs on imports from the UK would push up supermarket prices, likely to cost shoppers more than €1,000 a year on average, according to an ESRI study. Given the economic uncertainties of surrounding coronavirus, a UK exit without a trade deal at the end of this year would threaten a double whammy to the Irish economy and particularly to rural Ireland.What are the sticking points in the talks? The key issue is the terms on which the UK would be given access to the EU’s single market and what price it would pay in terms of aligning with EU rules and regulations. The EU side argues that as it has left the EU, the UK can no longer have the same access as it did, and must sign up to what are called level playing field provisions – sticking by EU rules in areas such as labour rules, state aid to businesses and the environment – if it wants to do so. The UK says the EU is making unreasonable demands. Specific issues such as fisheries, which were due to be concluded by July 1st, complicate matters further. As was said many times last year, the clock is ticking.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches. See more here.

Photograph: Stefan RousseauPA WireBritain has formally rejected an extension to the post-Brexit transition period and the EU has acknowledged the decision as definitive, so the standstill arrangement will end on December 31st. British cabinet office minister Michael Gove met European Commission vice-president Maros Sefcovic on Friday as the joint committee to implement the withdrawal agreement between the EU and the UK convened for the last time before the June 30th deadline for Britain to request an extension to the transition period.Mr Sefcovic said that although the EU remained open to extending the transition period, Mr Gove “was very clear, unequivocal, on the fact that the UK is not going to seek an extension”. “We take this decision as a definitive one,” Mr Sefcovic said.Britain said on Friday that it would phase in a light-touch customs regime for goods entering the UK from the EU, with full border controls not coming into force until July 2021. The freight transport industry welcomed the staggered introduction of controls, which the British government said was a response to the challenges presented by the coronavirus pandemic.“We have informed the EU today that we will not extend the transition period.

Today’s announcement is an important step towards getting the country ready for the end of the transition period.”Controlled imports such as tobacco and alcohol will be subject to full customs checks and tariffs from January, but importers of other goods will have six months to prepare customs declarations and pay tariffs.Devolved governments rowThe Scottish and Welsh governments, which have called for an extension of the transition period, withdrew from planned talks with the British government about Brexit strategy on Friday evening.“We cannot accept a way of working in which the views of the devolved governments are simply dismissed before we have had a chance to discuss them. In reality, the meetings we have had have simply been an opportunity for the UK government to inform us of their views, not to listen or respond to ours,” they said.British prime minister Boris Johnson will hold talks by video on Monday with European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen, European Council president Charles Michel and European Parliament president David Sassoli. The two sides have scheduled six meetings over the summer, with negotiating rounds on the future EU-UK trading relationship in August, September and October, alternating between London and Brussels if health restrictions allow.“With some six months to go before the end of the transition period we still have lots of work to do. This is true for all work streams, but in particular with regard to the Protocol on Northern Ireland and Ireland. The window of opportunity to put in place the operational measures needed to ensure that the protocol can function as intended on January 1st, 2021, is rapidly closing,” Mr\u0026nbspSefcovic said.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

A primary is a traditional election where eligible voters select their candidate privately through a ballot system. A caucus is a public process which sees voters align publicly with their chosen candidate at caucus sites.Based roughly on their share of the vote in each state - states have different rules -\u0026nbspcandidates are assigned a number of “delegates”, which will be sent to represent each state at the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in July.On March 3rd – Super Tuesday – 14 states and one overseas territory voted. After a faltering start to the primaries that almost saw him written off, former vice-president Joe Biden got his campaign firmly on track with victory in nine states. Though Vermont senator Bernie Sanders finished first in four states, including delegate-rich California, Super Tuesday checked the Sanders momentum after a strong opening to the primaries in Iowa, New Hampshire and\u0026nbspNevada.On March 10th\u0026nbspsix more states vote, with most of the remaining primaries taking place throughout March and April. The final primary contest takes place on June 7th. However, by the end of March, well over 50 per cent of the delegates will have been allocated.In order to be selected as the party’s nominee at the convention in July, a candidate needs a majority of 50 per cent of delegates plus one, so the magic number is 1,991 pledged delegates out of the total of 3,979.However, with four candidates remaining in the race - Elizabeth Warren and Tulsi Gabbard complete the field, after Michael\u0026nbspBloomberg’s\u0026nbspwithdrawal -\u0026nbspit is possible that no one candidate will have a majority of delegates when Democrats convene in July.Though the rules were changed after the 2016 convention following tensions between the Sanders and Hillary Clinton campaigns, so-called superdelegates - unpledged delegates - still play a role. These are senior members of the party – governors, former members of Congress, etc. Their 771 votes come into play if the convention is contested, which is\u0026nbspa possibility.Notably, six of the candidates were asked during a debate in Las Vegas on February 19th if they would support the idea of a candidate winning the nomination if they secured a plurality but not a majority of the delegates. All but one – Sanders – said they were opposed to this. The issue may become a headache for the Democratic Party as the primary process progresses."},{"url":null,"title":"broken promises idle hands lead political unrest","story":"Its inertia has surely fed the appetite of pandemic revolutionaries, for whom one clear response has emerged: now. Future dates which can be put off or sailed past have lost all meaning. In telling Britain to do nothing – one front on which the Government has led by example – people have been mobilised. Not against ministers. Or at least not yet. But protesters have found their energy in our leaders’ lack of it. In what was likely perceived as a blinding tactical move, lockdown restrictions remained in place while the sun blazed. Fine. Then the rain started falling and people spent more time indoors, more time looking, through pages and screens and whatever else, at what was happening “out there”. And in so doing, found that the problems that persisted and rolled on over years and decades and centuries were, in this moment, intolerable. We don’t live in a permanent revolution because our attentions are spread in too many ergent directions the office, the school runs and football matches and birthday celebrations. Not now. In seeing the murder of George Floyd, a moment could, with the will, become a movement. Thousands have taken to the streets over the past fortnight, statues have been tugged down and tossed in rivers, classic films and comedies and art consigned to a cultural wasteland. It is quite remarkable, what fire in the belly Parliamentary heads have mostly been kept down over the issue save for that of Priti Patel, who in a statement on the protests spoke of the racial discrimination she had faced. She was later accused of “gaslighting” the black community in a letter from 30 Labour MPs. The episode seems unlikely to motivate more frontbenchers to bother bringing it up again.And why would they? For now, the target is too wide to be placed squarely on the Government’s back – it is the accumulation of inequality, of institutionalised racism, that lies in protesters’ sights. But in 12 more weeks, when the end of the furlough scheme looms and the currently more abstract reality sets in – of Britain’s GDP dropping by a record 20.4 per cent in the first full month of lockdown, of the businesses that won’t reopen and jobs that won’t be returned to by workers of whom 6.4 million are on hiatus in England alone – the ire will find its way to those whose choices, or failure to make them, landed us here. If the groundswell of action over the past fortnight is to impress anything upon the Government, let it be the message that people will no longer wait quietly when promises are not kept.Having time on one’s hands can be more unpredictable than we might have realised. For Frédéric Desnard, a French worker at a luxury perfume-maker, absence of anything to do at the office was indeed so dull as to inspire a €50,000 lawsuit. Forget burnout, this was “bore-out”, the court ruled, a “daily humiliation” characterised by indignities such as “no one cared if I arrived at 9am or 10am. I had to buy some supplies – a few sheets of paper – then my day was over.” This led to a nervous breakdown and seven-month absence from work, which resulted in his dismissal the tedium of it all apparently tantamount to a form of harassment.French law stipulates companies can be sued for overworking employees this ruling will “create a new avenue”, Mr Desnard said, for the underworked, too – a group that analysts estimate could account for a third of the country’s workforce.His Goldilocks approach is commendable, probably, in that Mr Desnard did not wish to do less than he should while on company time and dime. Though given he’d already remained on staff while doing precious little for four years, he might have considered taking the lawsuit cash on top as having his porridge and eating it.In times of yore (before mid-March), celebrity sightings in cities were de rigueur. Dull, even. Jude Law in the pub? Not bothered. Shami Chakrabarti exercising sharp elbows in the Waitrose coffee queue? Everyone likes a freebie, I suppose. Ralph Fiennes in a restaurant with a woman half his age? Whatever. But now, with chances of spotting anyone – let alone recognisable types – radically reduced, news of celebrities out and about has become far more exciting. Behold – and reserve your jealousy – there is an A-lister in my midst. It’s Rupert the horse. I know. I could hardly believe it. After working at London’s protests over the weekend, he was visited at his stable at Lewisham Mounted Police Station by the Home Secretary his breed remains under wraps, presumably for fear it might reveal too much about his star status.Should he come a-clopping down my street, I’m sure he will be met with far greater fanfare than sleb encounters of the pre-Covid kind. Perhaps his contribution will one day be commemorated in the form of a plinth – even if it is later torn down.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"dare left say cant conservative little short racism","story":"It seems only fitting to discuss my “coming out” story during Pride month, a time of year we’re encouraged to celebrate ersity of all kinds. It’s unfortunate, however, that the irony is lost on the Left, who can only tolerate ersity if it’s skin deep. Dare stray from their approved cultural narrative, and you’re perceived as a dangerous threat.When I first “came out” as a Conservative voter in the staff room of the state secondary school I taught in at the time, you would have thought I had just admitted to supporting child labour. The dropped jaws and audible gasps were that of a typical Nineties cartoon. My colleagues were aghast. Suffice to say the reaction was tenfold when I later stood as a Tory candidate in Brent. The first of many abusive letters I received read, “Calvin I can only admire what a good house pet you have become as your slave masters taught you so well” (sic).Hostile reactions from Leftists are something most Right-leaning iniduals have become accustomed to. That’s why Conservatives form the silent majority it’s often easier to stay quiet than to face ostracisation for erting from the groupthink mentality of the Left. This situation is even worse for BAMEs on the Right.The Left seems to think they have a monopoly over us – as if our voting intentions should be determined by the colour of our skin. It’s unthinkable to believe in freedom, democracy, the rule of law and giving people a hand up instead of a handout. You’re brown you must vote Labour, believe “the system” is against you and that the world owes you a favour.It’s nothing short of racism. As a BAME, unless you’re a socialist, you’re considered a race traitor. Capitalism is for white folks only, apparently.It’s people like Florence Eshalomi, the Labour MP for Vauxhall, who would prefer to put us back in our boxes. When Priti Patel exposed her vulnerable side by sharing horrific incidents of racial discrimination from her past in the Chamber this week, was Ms Eshalomi’s first response to show compassion and to be empathetic toward her fellow parliamentarian?Of course not – she and dozens of other Labour BAME MPs decided instead to write Priti a letter accusing her of “gaslighting the very real racism faced by black people and communities across the UK”. The irony of ironies. Ms Patel has faced an intense backlash from the beginning of her career like me, she’s the “wrong type” of BAME to the racist Left.The greatest shame of the terrible situation we find ourselves in at the moment, with racial tensions brewing and vandalism and violence spreading across the nation, is that the UK is an incredibly free and tolerant society. What we should be doing is celebrating our successes. Britain has come a long way, to be one of the most erse and accepting countries in the world. That didn’t happen by accident.

The focus has already shifted to the harms being done to families’ wellbeing.On top of the deficit in formal education and structured routine, children are missing their friends and all the social and sporting activities that are part and parcel of normal school life. Many parents, especially working mothers, are having to take on an even larger burden and step in as teachers too.These are already plenty of reasons to regret the slow pace of school reopening. But there is also a growing awareness of the damage that prolonged closures are doing to the economy. This affects us all now and could continue to do so long into the future.These economic costs can be split into three parts. The most important is probably the least visible: the long-term damage caused by the fact that young people are missing out on education that could have increased their productivity, allowing them to contribute and earn more for the rest of their lives.This is a particular problem for poorer households who might benefit the most from a better start but are least likely to be able to study well at home, thus widening educational inequality.Economic studies have suggested that each additional year of schooling could raise incomes by as much as 10 per cent, especially in the early years (there’s some evidence that the value of a university education is now rapidly diminishing). If we assume that, on average, children are effectively missing out on three months of schooling, that could mean that a generation will earn two per cent less than they would otherwise have done throughout their working lives.That might not sound like a lot. But if we could think of any other intervention that could boost the UK’s annual productivity by two per cent, we would surely jump at it. Put another way, if we assume that someone might earn £1.2million over their lifetime, two per cent of that is a loss of £24,000, or £24billion in total for every million young people who are currently missing out.There will also be two types of short-term cost. One is the value of the lost output in the education sector itself. In total this sector accounts for a little under six per cent of the UK economy, but this figure includes nurseries and universities as well as schools. Even schools are, of course, also still providing some education. If we assume that two per cent of national output is lost for three months, that is a total hit of about £11 billion.We also need to think about the impact on the productivity of working parents who are stuck at home. That could double the short-term costs. For example, if three million parents (out of about 33 million in employment) can only earn half of what they would normally do for three months, that could be another £11billion in lost income. In practice, there could be several million parents who will not be able to work at all.In total, then, it’s reasonable to suggest that every three months that schools are shut down could cost about £22billion – or about one per cent of a normal year’s GDP. And in the longer term, every child affected could contribute two per cent less to the economy.Strictly speaking, we should view each of these numbers separately. In particular, it wouldn’t be right to add the short-term cost of lost output in the education sector to the long-term hit on future earnings.At best this would be double counting, because the benefits of a good education are presumably related to the value of the resources that are used to provide them. But the key point is that keeping schools closed will have substantial economic costs in both the short and the long term, even without taking account of the less tangible impacts on wellbeing.This is also something that should worry everyone. The Government should continue to prioritise the reopening of schools and be willing to spend more to make that happen, including increased funding for summer schools, and investment in new infrastructure and equipment so that schools have the capacity to teach more children and still meet social distancing rules.We could knock up a ‘Nightingale hospital’ in a few weeks.

It’s not all about cream tea.”The lavish Powis Castle home of Clive of India could be among the sites which will serve a darker history with the tea and scones, as the heritage charity begins “accelerating plans” to reassess statues, sites, and collections.This week a statue was removed of a kneeling black man from the forecourt of Dunham Massey hall in Altrincham, Greater Manchester, due to the upset and distress it is causing.Sites with controversial histories will not be cut loose from the charity’s portfolio of more than 500 houses and gardens.Dr Fowler’s comments come after the National Trust’s director-general Hilary McGrady told staff and volunteers that “systemic bias and racism are everyone’s business”, and the charity’s future activities would reflect this.Those working for the heritage group will be offered support on issues of race brought to the fore by the protests, and guided to educate visitors on slavery and colonialism.Visitor information at sites like Penrhyn Castle and Speke Hall, built with wealth from plantations, will be reorientated to better reflect dark pasts glossed over with beauty.“It’s vital to talk about it, and people can deal with it,” said Dr Fowler.“We were an empire for four centuries.  If you delve deeper into our stately homes, that history is there.“These places are, and were always intended to be, a veneer, an idyllic facade.  And we have fallen for it.”The shift at the National Trust follows outcry over statues of slavers and perceived profiteers in the UK which has seen monuments toppled by crowds.Dr Fowler believes many of the charity’s sites could be similarly criticised for their colonial links.There are no plans to destroy sites or remove them from the care of the charity due to their links to historic immorality. They will be protected and used to inform “in a way that is sensitive and inclusive”.Sites will have necessary security and be “managed appropriately” in order to explore “painful and challenging” histories.Director-general Ms McGrady added: “It’s my job to give people direction and guidance and make sure the National Trust is an inclusive place for everyone.“This means equipping them to deliver our plan, which is to serve an increasingly erse population and foster equality and respect in all our places.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"want save british economy must get shop","story":"My high street in north London is preparing to come back from the dead. Walking around last week, it was marvellous to see the shops with their shutters pulled up – like the opened eyes of a patient waking from a coma – and their owners inside busily stocking and preparing their interiors in anticipation of Magic Monday.I have never been quite so vividly aware of the extent to which commerce is a necessity of life. And for the benefit of those Left-wing idiots who will assume that I am referring to capitalism, let me make this clear: it is not just the market economy in which money is exchanged for goods that is at issue here. The most basic forms of trade in which profit is not a motive – barter, reciprocal offers of services, agreements on the communal use of natural resources – can all serve this purpose. However simple or primitive the modes of transaction, economic activity is essential to the survival of any organised society.So here we are – about to re-engage in one of the most fundamental aspects of human interaction. We will have real conversations with real people who will be there to offer their tangible products – and in the course of those proceedings, the social bonds of the community will be reinforced. Everybody will remember what everyday life used to be like before it was closed for business by government edict.By comparison to this visceral experience, all the present noise and rhetoric will be as nothing. Providing that we accept the invitation to step back into the real world, to start living again in the way that we once took for granted, most of the nonsense that is being talked now will seem absurd.The media hype about inevitable economic disaster can be blown away by a happy resurgence of activity with confidence reinforcing itself as more and more consumers emerge blinking from their private darkness.In truth, none of the present predictions about future economic growth are anything more than wild guesses: no one has any real world experience on which to base these hypotheses because there has never been such a total systematic shutdown of so many advanced economies before. Of course the UK economy has already contracted by around a fifth. That’s because it has been forcibly and deliberately prevented from functioning. What is remarkable is not the 20 percent figure but the fact that so many observers appear to be shocked by it: this is like being surprised that the car has stopped when you turn off the engine.Particularly over-hyped was the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development “forecast” that the UK’s GDP would be the hardest hit of the major European countries. What the figures actually showed was that the “expected fall” in the UK growth would be 11.5 percent, against France at 11.4, Italy at 11.3 and Spain at 11.1. So we are talking about differences of fractions of one percent here, and even this was based on statistical estimations of economic activity - which is to say, generalised guessing about human behaviour.This is tantamount to saying that it is all up to you. The extent and speed of recovery will depend (and will be a measure of) how many people are ready to accept the invitation to embrace life as it was previously lived. That is to say, on how large a proportion of the population is not so terrified by the risks of associating with other human beings that they are prepared to come out of hiding.For the first time, perhaps, we will have an actual measure of how much anxiety and irrational dread must be expunged before social (and economic) normality can be restored.I can hear you saying: but is it irrational? Surely there was – and maybe still is – good cause for the unprecedented measures which have disrupted so many lives? Yes, perhaps – especially when even the expert virologists knew next to nothing about the pattern of this disease. But now we know quite a lot. We know that children are in scarcely any danger from it and are most unlikely to transmit it. We know (and have known almost from the start) that only a very small percentage of people who contract it will become seriously ill – and to a great extent we even know how to identify that group.And yet the government persists in prohibiting, quite indiscriminately, almost all of the social interactions and economic activity that would allow national recovery. Worse, it offers banalities like “only when it is safe to do so”, when it is asked when its tiny baby steps might accelerate into a trot.So when, in their opinion, will it be safe? The average number of new cases has been down to around a dozen or so a day in London for some while. As a public health threat this scarcely registers on the historic scale. So can we assume that when the whole of the country reaches this number, it will be “safe” to come out of lockdown completely?Or if we reach this universal stage of low incidence, will it  have to prevail for a given length of time before it is “safe”? If so, how long? A week, a month, a year? Until we are certain there will not be a second peak? When will that be? What are the government’s own criteria for making these judgments? Until they tell us that, we must assume that there are none: that they will simply make political decisions based on how much the societal and economic damage outweighs the risk to (some) people’s health.If that is the case, as I suspect it is, then some pretty subtle analysis is going to be required to make those political choices. The British are, to their great credit, very law-abiding people but the other side of that coin is that they tend to be quite passive rule-followers. Told to “stay at home and save lives”, they did exactly that. So how genuinely fearful are they now of catching or spreading, the virus? Or are they still just doing what they have been told is their duty to the country?We may find out this week. If you want to have a real say in the economic future of the country, get out there and shop for Britain.

What we should be worrying about is the kind of economy we are going to find ourselves in when the acute phase of the crisis is over says Ben ChuThe estimated hit to UK economic activity in April is truly massive – “gargantuan” in the words of one analyst, “devastating” says another.The loss of a fifth of economic output in a single month fully justifies those adjectives.But beyond the headline, what do the figures actually mean?Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesWhat should we be focusing on?The story of the UK’s unprecedented GDP collapse in five chartsIt’s important to recognise that this recession is not normal in the sense that they are usually brought on by something taking place essentially within the economy itself – a financial crisis, a loss of confidence by consumers, a spike in the cost of borrowing etc.In this case, it has been created by a government-ordered lockdown to contain a new disease and this has prevented huge swathes of normal economic activity taking place.Some argue that most of the activity would have ceased in any case as people stopped going to work and restaurants and travelling and so on because of the risk of catching the coronavirus.That’s debatable, but even if that is correct the essential fact remains that this is not a normal recession.And that matters because it means the level of activity has been, in a sense, artificially constrained.When the economy opens up, as it is now starting to, a large amount of economic activity will automatically return.So we can reasonably expect a majority of that lost 20 per cent of activity to return in the subsequent months as people go back to work, schools and businesses reopen.However, that does not mean we can be relaxed about the economic outlook. Far from it.Early hopes that the total level of economic activity could be back to where it was before the crisis by the end of the year are now looking increasingly less likely to be realised.Schools are not reopening as rapidly as hoped.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Demand for our exports seems likely to be feeble with the rest of the world largely struggling with a historic recession.It’s hard to see business investment recovering strongly with so many firms having been forced to take on more debt to ride out the lockdown.Even if most of the damage we are currently seeing in these GDP figures is reversed later in the year, we might still find ourselves grappling with what in normal circumstances would be considered an exceptionally weak economy.That’s what we should be worrying about – the kind of economy we are going to find ourselves in when the acute phase of the crisis is over. That’s what will matter most for our jobs and livelihoods over the coming years.It’s where the main challenge for economic policymakers – in the Treasury and the Bank of England – also resides.The crisis has effectively forced us to shut down huge sections of our economy. It was, in the eyes of most people, necessary to save lives.But we need to ensure that, as it restarts, we get back everything we have lost.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

This could be due to the delay between people experiencing symptoms and people being tested for Covid-19.Google has previously attempted to predict such trends through its nowcast function, which launched in 2008. A paper published in the scientific journal Nature at the time explained how people\u0027s search patterns could estimate flu prevalence two weeks before it was registered by official bodies like the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).As the world\u0027s most popular online search engine, the data from people\u0027s digital footprints offered potentially life-saving insights and it was the poster child of so-called \u0027Big Data\u0027. But by 2015 it was shut down after it failed to foresee a massive flu outbreak in 2013.UK now has more daily Covid-19 deaths than the rest of Europe combinedIt was described by some publications as an epic failure and a note on its landing page now states: Google Flu Trends and Google Dengue Trends are no longer publishing current estimates of Flu and Dengue fever based on search patterns...  It is still early days for nowcasting and similar tools for understanding the spread of diseases like flu and dengue – we\u0027re excited to see what comes next.A blog post explaining the decision said that Google would work directly with academic institutions to make sense of the search data. More than 265 peer-reviewed papers have since drawn on aggregated data taken from Google searches, used to track epidemics like Ebola in 2014, Zika in 2016 and West Nile fever over several years in Italy.

Please consider a contribution or subscription.More than half of Britons now support an extension to the Brexit transition period this year with this rising to two-thirds of people when potential shortages of medical supplies are factored in.New research by the Health Foundation and Ipsos Mori suggests the coronavirus outbreak has reshaped views of the EU and Britain’s link with the continent with a clear majority of the public supporting closer working with the EU to tackle the virus.As part of a wider survey of people’s experiences during the outbreak, 77 per cent said the UK should work “very closely” with the EU on Covid-19 responses with another 17 per cent saying it should work “fairly closely” with the EU.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe UK and EU are currently in negotiations over the longer term relationship after the Brexit transition period which is due to end on 31 December.The latest round of negotiations have stalled, with the UK’s chief negotiator David Frost saying the two sides had come “close to reaching the limits of what we can achieve”.Boris Johnson to hold talks with Macron amid Brexit talks deadlockUK set to backtrack on plans for full EU border checks from January 1Prime minister Boris Johnson is to hold talks with EU officials next week to try and break the deadlock.Of those surveyed by Ipsos Mori, almost all of those who voted Remain in the EU Referendum (99 per cent) supported working closely with the EU to combat the pandemic, and over nine in 10 (91per cent) of those who voted Leave also supported closer collaboration.Using two sample groups Ipsos Mori found 54 per cent of people said the government should request a Brexit extension beyond 31 December.A second group were given information that was in line with government estimates about potential delays to the supply of medicines and medical devices in the event of a no-deal. In total 65 per cent, two thirds, believed there should be an extension, 31 per cent said no.Young people, aged 18 to 24, were far more likely to support an extension.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This would come at the same time as the health service is facing significant pressures from seasonal flu, supporting people recovering from Covid-19, tackling the large backlog of patients who didn’t receive care during lockdown, and potentially coping with another wave of infection from the coronavirus.“This would be a vicious, and avoidable, combination of risks.”She added: “The public understandably prefer protection from risks that can be anticipated and avoided. This research suggests the public clearly prioritise the management of the coronavirus pandemic, and collaboration with the EU.”The House of Commons Health Select Committee warned in March 2018 that moving to WTO trading rules could impact the supplies of some medicines and devices that would not be covered by existing zero tariff rules. In the same year, health secretary Matt Hancock asked medical suppliers to stockpile drugs ahead of a no-deal Brexit.The survey also found four-fifths of Remain voters backed an extension to the transition while 66 per cent of Leave voters opposed an extension. Almost 40 per cent of Leave voters backed an extension once informed of the implications of a no deal scenario.The survey was conducted by using a representative sample of people aged 18 and over between 1 and 10 May 2020.A total of 1,983 people were interviewed with quotas set on age, gender, region and working status and data weighted to be representative of the population.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

For example, we know that any stress-inducing illness can cause blood sugar levels to temporarily rise and we see this for example with heart attacks.”He added: “Also, people who are more likely to get very sick with Covid may be at risk of developing diabetes anyway, perhaps because they are overweight.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Her comments resulted in an apology from the soap and its pledge to “stamp out discrimination”. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe latest controversy stems from a WhatsApp exchange posted to Twitter by former Hollyoaks star Charlie Clapham. Clapham, who played Freddie Roscoe on the soap between 2013 – 2017, tweeted: “Dear @chezLysette if supporting a former castmate, whilst she speaks of being racially discriminated against, makes me a traitor... then so be it.Taylor Swift calls for removal of racist monuments in TennesseeActors criticised for ‘cringe-worthy’ anti-racism PSA“As for embittered, you’re currently finishing (finished) where I started out. Salty much? – Best, CCFR.”In the messages, Lysette, 56, appears to criticise her fellow co-stars for supporting Adedji, and comments: “Sorry, but we’re not going to have a job to come back to if this stuff keeps being disseminated.”​She had previously written: “Well to be fair, they both have that embittered, traitor vibe going on,” apparently in response to Clapham expressing support for Adedeji.In a tweet on 7 June, Lysette responded to a fan expressing disappointment at her silence over Adedji’s comments about on-set racism: “Oh I will speak.. from a place of compassion and FACT. But I will NOT be bullied into safe, white, knee jerk rhetoric.”Adedeji responded to Clapham’s tweet: “@chezLysette you are actual trash.. Charlie, you are a King and a true ally!! Love you my bro!

And there are no front footprints.”Professor Kyung Soo Kim, who also authored the paper alongside Jong Deock Lim, Seul Mi Bae and Anthony Romilio, corroberated Professor Lockley’s view.This is because of how deep the animal’s heel left an impression in the fossil.“Our trackways are very narrow-looking - more like a crocodile balancing on a tight-rope,” he told the BBC. “When combined with the lack of any tail-drag marks, it became clear that these creatures were moving bipedally.Created with Sketch.Science Photographer of the Year shortlist  Show all 9Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.19 Soap bubble structures showing light interference colours and patterningBubbles want to optimise space and minimise their surface area for a given volume of air.

The pop star has urged lawmakers to take down the statues, arguing that the “villains” they celebrate do not deserve them. “As a Tennessean, it makes me sick that there are monuments standing in our state that celebrate racist historical figures who did evil things,” Swift tweeted. “Edward Carmack and Nathan Bedford Forrest were DESPICABLE figures in our state history and should be treated as such.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesShe noted that Carmack, whose statue was torn down last week during protests, was “a white supremacist newspaper editor who published pro-lynching editorials and incited the arson of the office of Ida B Wells”.Demonstrators toppled the statue of Carmack, which stood outside the Tennessee Capitol, on 30 May. Around the US and in the UK, a number of statues celebrating slave owners and other figures with racist histories are being taken down in support of the Black Lives Matter movement. Swift suggested that Carmack’s statue be replaced with one of Wells for her “pioneering work in journalism and civil rights”.She also issued a condemnation of the state’s house committee for voting against the removal of a bust of Nathan Bedford Forrest, which has been branded “hideous” by US media.

Twitter, like Facebook and other major social media sites, is currently banned in China.“We should expect continued evolution and improvement, given the enormous resourcing the Chinese party‑state can bring to bear in aligning state messaging across its diplomacy, state media and covert influence operations.” the ASPI wrote.The research pointed out a number of tactics from the Chinese government to attempt to shape the information environment to its advantage,” including:The coordination of diplomatic and state media messagingThe use of Western social media platforms to seed disinformation into international media coverageThe immediate mirroring and rebuttal of Western media coverage by Chinese state mediaThe co‑option of fringe conspiracy media to target networks vulnerable to manipulationThe use of coordinated inauthentic networks and undeclared political ads to actively manipulate social media audiencesAdditional reporting by ReutersBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Unfortunately, not long after her return, jobs began to get cancelled because of the intensifying Covid-19 crisis.She started looking for something else right away – and is currently living and working on New Moor Farm in Southminster, Essex, working with asparagus, having swapped fashion for food.Though a far cry from a usual career, Philip is enjoying her new setting. “Right now, I live on site on the farm, in one of the caravans in the orchard. It’s nice,” she explains. “The community is amazing. There are so many different characters on the farm. Everyone is really friendly and we’re all here for the same reasons: to help and to work.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHer day-to-day routine varies. “Most days I’m up at five, start working at six on the farm, in the packhouse,” she says. “Generally, I’m doing a little bit of everything, so I’m helping on the line, bundling, helping customers, grading – just helping out wherever I can.”Philip is among Brits across the country working on farms in order to help the industry continue despite the many obstacles presented by the Covid-19 pandemic.The temporary closure of much of the food and hospitality industry has left huge quantities of fresh produce at risk of going to waste. The pubs and restaurants that would usually purchase large amounts of vegetables remain shut and travel restrictions have prevented pickers from overseas working on the farms.Join the Pick For BritainThat’s why the Government is urging fit and healthy people looking for work across the country to get involved. The Pick For Britain initiative is helping to bring workers and employers together to ensure the farming industry can continue.From furloughed employees whose contracts allow them to work during this time, to university students on their summer breaks, it’s a great opportunity to earn money and meet new people – while helping Britain’s food industry during these unprecedented times.The growing season is only just getting started, so from now until September, bringing in the harvest requires a major effort. Visit pickforbritain.org.uk to find out moreEat seasonal and local vegBut that’s not the only way to support the industry right now. Simply eating more in-season local produce will help to prevent wastage.A wide range of vegetables are currently being harvested in the UK. These include asparagus, cucumbers, mushrooms, courgettes, spinach, summer squash, radishes, beetroot and tomatoes – and buying and cooking with this seasonal veg is a great way to contribute to the farming industry.​In need of some recipe inspo?

That’s why there\u0027s never been a better time to try something new.Among the wide range of different species found in UK waters are mussels, crab, mackerel, herring, rainbow trout, hake and coley (or saithe).

All the famous faces, including a picture of Sir Peter, are “fans” of the Mandarin Oriental Hotel Group.Each fragment will be signed by the artist and auctioned on Bidsquare, with bids starting at £325. The auction will be live until midnight on 26 June.The idea originated when London Advertising approached Sir Peter about the project as it wanted to use the mural to raise money for organisations helping people during the pandemic.Sir Peter, who also designed artwork for Paul Weller, Ian Dury and The Who, said: “I’m very happy that the Mandarin Oriental mural can be used a second time to raise money for such a wonderful purpose.

But organisers stepped up after the lockdown began and started providing 5,000 meals a week to families in Poplar struggling to afford or access food.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesDizzee volunteered as part of his work with Kitchen Social – the Mayor’s Fund for London programme providing food for children across the capital during the school holidays. “I was given an amazing opportunity to visit and help out Kitchen Social at Bygrove Primary School in Poplar, who are providing free food, books and school equipment to kids in the local area where I grew up,” he said.“Thank you to all the amazing people I met and thanks to the Mayor’s Fund for London for connecting the dots.”How to support our campaignBygrove Primary School is also receiving vital supplies from The Independent’s Help the Hungry campaign appeal partner The Felix Project.The food surplus charity, which delivers to hundreds of food banks and community projects across London, began helping the school at the start of the crisis by dropping off one or two trays of fresh produce and staple items each week.The charity has since increased the supply from one or two trays of food each week to 40 trays to help organisers cope with the huge demand.Mark Causton, manager of the school’s initiative, said: “The Felix Project have been an immense help – I can’t praise them enough. We know we’ll need to carry on this work right through the summer, so we rely on all the fresh food they’re supplying.”Mr Causton added: “We’ve seen a lot of parents furloughed or losing work over the past couple of months. In the case of some families struggling to afford to buy shopping, this is one of their only sources of getting food for their children.“It was really great to have Dizzee Rascal here helping out. He got stuck in, and got on so well with all the volunteers and all the families. It was just nice to see a smile on a lot of people’s faces.”The Independent is encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry during the crisis – find out how you can help here.

Figures from the Independent Food Aid Network (IFAN) show a 175 per cent rise, with both charities reporting this their “busiest period ever”. Furthermore, a survey by the giving platform Neighbourly of 900 charities and community groups providing food to the vulnerable found that 70 per cent expect the situation to get even worse in the next six to 12 months.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe Independent proprietor Evgeny Lebedev paid special tribute to the almost 6,000 ordinary iniduals who have dug deep to contribute to our appeal. He said: “Time and time again Londoners have shown that they are capable of immense generosity and community spirit in this period of crisis.“To all those that donated, bought and bid — I salute you.”Morgan Stanley said the bank and its employees in London had made the donation as part of their global Covid-19 response.How to support our campaignClare Woodman, head of Morgan Stanley EMEA, said: “The Felix Project plays a vital role in distributing food to people in need, especially those severely impacted by the pandemic. I am proud our employees in London are supporting them as part of our Covid-19 Hunger Relief Campaign.”Another substantial donor was Partners Capital investment group, which donated £95,287.John Collis, head of Partners Capital, Europe, said they “selected The Felix Project as one of our charities to support during this difficult period as it is one of the most impactful charities in London today”.Heads down for quiz nightThe original Top Gear trio — Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May — will tonight host a special Zoom quiz in aid of our appeal partner, The Felix Project. Participants in the Quintessentially Foundation’s “World’s Greatest Quiz Night” will face five rounds of questions devised by Nicholas Shearing, questions producer for top British TV quiz shows Pointless, Debatable and Impossible. May, who has driven Felix vans delivering food to vulnerable Londoners throughout lockdown, said: “At least in this stay-at-home pub quiz version, it will be easy to cheat.” 7.30-9pm. Tickets £10: thefelixproject.orggreatestquizOur appeal was also boosted by the silent auction, in partnership with Quintessentially Foundation, which closed this week with 135 bids placed for 36 lots and raising almost £40,000.The most highly prized lots were two tickets to a Liverpool FC game, four tickets to the Euro 2021 semi-finals, a video-chat with Spurs coach Jose Mourinho, a private guitar lesson with singer-songwriter Ellie Goulding and a helicopter lesson.The Independent is encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry during the crisis – find out how you can help here.

After paying rent and all her bills from the universal credit she receives at the beginning of the month, she now finds she has just £4.30 left over for food and nappies for the rest of the month.How to support our campaignSo she is almost entirely dependent on school vouchers available for her oldest two children (£15 per child per week) to buy absolute essentials, and one weekly food package dropped off by the Sufra food bank.“I don’t mind going hungry sometimes, so long as my kids have food,” said Ms Sarri-Gonzalez. “Sometimes I might have just one main meal for myself in a day. There was one point during lockdown I didn’t manage to eat anything for myself for two days, almost three days. But I always set the table for the children – I keep things as normal as possible for them.”“It’s so difficult at the moment. So stressful. I’m hoping when the kids go back to school later in the year I can go back to work and make things easier somehow.”The Independent’s Help the Hungry campaign appeal partner The Felix Project has quadrupled the volume of surplus food it gets out to people in need since the crisis began.The work remains as urgent than ever. The most recent YouGov poll for the Food Foundation charity shows over 1.5 million people in households with children have been unable to access food for economic reasons during the lockdown.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Watching parents struggle to put food on the table and go without food themselves is devastating.”Rebecca Archer and her partner – who have three girls aged eight, six and three at home in London’s High Barnet – have found it difficult to afford enough food during lockdown. “The shopping I do is costing a lot more with them at home all the time,” she said.Once the bills are paid and the main weekly shop is done on a Monday, the couple finds they have about £50 left to get through the week – about half the amount they usually had before the pandemic hit.The family has recently taken advantage of two £15-a-week school vouchers they get for their two oldest girls, and receive some cooked meals from their neighbour Katie-Louise Barber – a volunteer delivering food using The Felix Project’s supplies.“It’s been a real strain. Thinking and worrying about money all the time isn’t easy,” said Ms Archer. “I never thought I’d be worrying about having enough for the children to eat. There was one point we just didn’t have enough for the pre-paid gas meter, so we had to go without that for more than a week.”The Trussell Trust, which runs the country’s biggest network of food banks, has warned food charities cannot cope “indefinitely” with the huge spike in demand for help caused by the pandemic.A coalition of anti-poverty charities had written to the chancellor asking for an emergency income support scheme that would increase child benefits and end the five-week wait for initial universal credit payments.Anthony Cotterill, leader of the Salvation Army in the UK, warned: “It’s years since we have seen poverty to be such a real and present danger for so many people. We are approaching a poverty tipping point.”The Independent is encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry during the crisis. Find out how you can help here.

Everyone is very grateful,’ says a volunteer who also uses service when his own illness means he is unable to pitch inFormer music manager John McIntyre was unsure how he would cope when lockdown began.“I was very scared,” said the 75-year-old who has a respiratory condition and lives alone in a one-bedroom flat in Dalston. “If I caught Covid, I wouldn’t be able to get enough oxygen to the heart. I just had to follow the advice and be safe.” Mr McIntyre, who used to manage the jazz reggae band The Beatroots, has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and emphysema.He has relied for his daily meal from local charity Made In Hackney which is supplied by our Help the Hungry appeal partner, The Felix Project. Mr McIntyre is one of more than two million people who are classified as “extremely vulnerable” because they have compromised immune systems. For the last 10 weeks, many of them have struggled to get access to food.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesSince March, volunteers from the River House Trust charity have been dropping off Felix produce to people living with HIV. One such volunteer is former actor Stephen Hart who was diagnosed in 2006. When he is too ill to leave the house, he also uses the food delivery service.Despite being high-risk and a life-long diabetic, Mr Hart has been helping to get food to those more vulnerable than him. He has been unable to work since his health deteriorated two years ago, but Mr Hart, who lives alone in south London, said he wanted to help others.How to support our campaign“When I feel well enough, I pick up boxes from River House and drop them off for people who need them,” he said. “I do it when I can but some days are bad days.”Mr Hart said his condition means sometimes he can’t get out of bed. He occasionally receives a Felix box for himself so he knows he has food when he is too sick to move. “It is reassuring to have food in the house,” he said. “Felix has been a lifeline.”Although the British HIV Association said there “remains no evidence” that people with HIV are at greater risk of Covid-19 infection, those with a low CD4 count – the white blood cells affected by HIV – have been advised to shield.Mr Hart said members of the HIV community have been “nervous” since the outbreak. “There isn’t much specific advice so the community has been trying to look after each other.”A 62-year-old living with HIV for 37 years, who asked not to be named, described how his parcels have helped him. He said: “I pick up the boxes as I don’t have energy to go shopping. They’ve been great.”Mr Hart said it was extremely moving to see the response to his deliveries: “It is amazing. Everyone is very grateful.”The Independent is encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry during the crisis – find out how you can help here.

It has four core beliefs: family, integrity, teamwork and success – all integral pillars of its Reconnection to Recovery and Resilience programme.Put together by Sharon Gray OBE and the federation’s head teachers, it’s designed to welcome pupils back to class after lockdown. “Everybody in the Embark community has done their bit,” says Gray, a headteacher for 20 years, mostly in special schools supporting youngsters experiencing social, emotional and mental health difficulties and schools going through challenges.“It’s been all hands on deck,” executive headteacher and Trust leader of Embark’s schools Matthew Crawford adds. “Even two weeks into lockdown we were thinking about our children returning to school, whatever date that may be.”Safety at school1. Anyone who is unwell or been in contact with somebody showing coronavirus symptoms should stay away from schools, colleges and childcare settings2. Hands should be cleaned more often than usual with soap and running water for at least 20 seconds and dried thoroughly. Alternatively, hand sanitiser or alcohol hand rub can be used3. Promote the ‘catch it, bin it, kill it’ approach to coughing and sneezing4. Clean frequently touched surfaces regularly using standard products, such as detergent and bleach5. Help to minimise contact and mixing by altering classroom layout and timetablesWith regards to physical changes that parents and pupils can expect to see in corridors and classrooms, Embark is working with Government guidance and undertaking a thorough, bespoke risk assessment for each of its schools. “It can’t be a one-size-fits all approach,” Crawford stresses.According to Anna Upton – head of the 240-pupil Chaucer Junior School in Ilkeston, Derbyshire – questionnaires were sent out to reconnect with parents, through which they could express concerns and suggest ideas about the return to classrooms.According to Upton, staggered breaks and how drop-offs will work were important issues that were flagged in questionnaires. “But the risk assessment the Trust has put in has allowed us to make a comprehensive plan and we can communicate that to the parents,” she explains.“What the Trust have done with the programme is to implement nine stages which support our schools to open as safely as possible, supporting the staff parents and the children. The risk assessment means that I, as a headteacher, can do what’s right for my school.”Chair of trustees Sarah Armitage emphasises the importance of teamwork based around a guiding principle: families first. We look after families, so we reach out we talk.” she says.“Then there’s teamwork. Let’s harness the power of the team so it’s not the headteacher sitting by themselves with all these things to think about – that load is shared.”Armitage’s back-to-school outlook is optimistic too: “We have created something with this programme that we hope will be massively beneficial. Our role as leaders is to keep that going, carry on putting emotional needs at the heart of everything we do, because then children are able to learn and benefit – and move through this crisis.”Information in this article applies to schools in England only.

The government says it will phase in full controls from April on products of animal origin, with the extra forms and customs declarations required for all traders three months later. Extend Brexit transition period to save stalling trade talks, EU urgesUK borders ‘still not ready for leaving single market at end of year’Officials say they were working on the basis that full controls would be in place for July but that they could be delayed even longer if there is significant disruption.The European Union is expected to impose full border controls on goods travelling from the UK on 1 January as planned.“Today’s announcement is very welcome news for the logistics industry,” said Alex Veitch, head of international policy at Freight Transport Association (FTA).“Government has listened to our concerns and made allowances to enable our sector to recover from the Covid-19 pandemic and plan effectively and in good time for a new trading relationship with Europe,” he said, adding that business would “now have time to learn and adapt to new procedures”.Michael Gove, the cabinet office minister who is overseeing much of Brexit preparation, said: “We have informed the EU today that we will not extend the transition period. The moment for extension has now passed. At the end of this year we will control our own laws and borders which is why we are able to take the sovereign decision to introduce arrangements in a way that gives businesses impacted by coronavirus time to adjust.

The government wants to negotiate a free trade agreement that would eliminate all or most tariffs to be paid on goods, but even in this case businesses would still be subject to the new checks and extra paperwork. The customs sector has said that 50,000 new customs agents will be required to deal with all the new bureaucracy, with nowhere near that recruited so far. Britain left the European Union in January but is currently in a Brexit transition period under which all EU rules apply until the end of the year.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Please consider a contribution or subscription.England’s chief nurse was dropped from one of Downing Street’s daily coronavirus briefings after refusing to publicly back Dominic Cummings, senior sources have told The Independent.As Boris Johnson’s chief aide was engulfed in scandal over his trips to Durham and Barnard Castle during lockdown, Ruth May had been due to appear alongside the health secretary Matt Hancock in the press conference.But, in practice questions hours before the briefing, she was asked about Mr Cummings and, after failing to give support to the prime minister’s chief adviser, she was immediately dropped from the press conference, according to senior NHS sources.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesInstead the health secretary had to present the slides on Covid-19 himself for the first time, alongside Professor John Newton from Public Health England. The incident, on 1 June, was two days after England’s deputy chief medical officer Jonathan Van-Tam sparked headlines by saying that lockdown rules “apply to all” when asked about Mr Cummings. He has not appeared at the press conferences since 30 May.Seven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreak‘They can blame it for everything’: What coronavirus means for BrexitThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxDo you need a face mask and where can you buy one?UK lockdown: Can I see my family and friends under new rules?Another added: “JVT was the first to publicly push back on TV. Everyone is being asked to support the government positions prior to doing a press conference. If they don’t, they get dropped.“First it was Dominic Cummings, then easing lockdown and now the R-rate and the two-metre rule.”Separately, Whitehall officials are critical of what they see as No 10’s grip on the daily briefings and the way the science and health advice is being used.No 10 has previously touted the briefings – with ministers alongside health and scientific advisers – as an opportunity for the public to get advice directly from the experts on coronavirus. When they began in March, Downing Street said they would focus on informing the public “on how to protect themselves”.In April, when questions from members of the public were introduced alongside those from journalists, the prime minister’s official spokesman said it was “absolutely right that the public gets the chance to put their questions to the government and its experts”.Mr Johnson repeatedly insisted that public adherence to lockdown would not be affected by the revelations involving Mr Cummings.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Mr Shapps said he was sure Ruth May would be back at the briefings in future.NHS England medical director Steve Powis said he did not know anything about “the various discussions”, adding: “I’ve been here many times saying exactly what I think.”Asked to comment, No 10 said it strongly denied the claims that Ms May had been dropped over her views on Mr Cummings and added that health and scientific advisers would continue to take questions in the briefings.

Please consider a contribution or subscription.The government must not abandon workers, including vulnerable people forced to shield, as the coronavirus furlough scheme winds up, the head of the Trades Union Congress (TUC) has said.Amid growing fears of mass employment cuts, Frances O’Grady called on ministers to commit to be “flexible” on plans to taper the job retention scheme, which has seen the state pay the wages of almost 9 million workers.In an interview with The Independent, Ms O’Grady said it would be “a crime” to see hard-hit industries fail because of a “rigid approach” to winding up state support.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesShe also called on the government to commit to exempting people who are shielding at home from strict deadlines that prevented new applications to the furlough scheme after 10 June.Labour has warned that the deadline means anyone diagnosed with a condition after 10 June will not be eligible for furlough, despite being forbidden from going to work.Seven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreak‘They can blame it for everything’: What coronavirus means for BrexitThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxDo you need a face mask and where can you buy one?UK lockdown: Can I see my family and friends under new rules?Boris Johnson told MPs this week the issue of shielding would be addressed “forthwith” but did not set out any further details.Official figures showed that the economy contracted by more than a fifth in April – the first full month of lockdown – in the largest fall in GDP since records began.Ministers are braced for the extent of the impact on the economy to be laid bare as the furlough scheme begins to wind up. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has extended the support package until October, but employers will be asked to begin contributing towards the salaries of furloughed staff.Ms O’Grady said: “I think what’s key is that the government needs to be prepared to be flexible. We’ve got industries that can get back up on their feet quickly, and that’s great.“You’ve got other industries that can recover, but frankly it’s going to take years – industries like aviation, hospitality, creative.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But we need answers to that.”On protecting shielded workers, a Treasury source said: “We’re looking in the round at the ways in which the government continues to support the most vulnerable in our society.“As the PM and chancellor have made clear, we will work tirelessly to ensure people are supported through this difficult time.”Ms O’Grady also called for answers on how working parents can balance childcare with returning to the workplace following the delay in getting many year-groups back into the classroom.Young people are also a cause for concern. Recent research by the TUC found that the UK was on the brink of a surge in youth unemployment, with 20 per cent of workers under 25-years-old working in hospitality and the creative sector, which are likely to be hardest hit by the pandemic.Created with Sketch.Care home hit by coronavirus: A rare glimpse of life inside Show all 18Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Jack Dodsley, 79, with a carer in PPE at Newfield Nursing HomeJackie Wilson, a healthcare assistant, wearing PPE before going into roomsJack Dodsley, 79, speaks to a carer at Newfield Nursing HomeCarers working at Newfield Nursing HomeJack Dodsley, 79, sits with a carerJack Dodsley, 79, with a carer in PPEA staff member at Newfield Nursing Home looks after a residentA carer helps Jack Dodsley, 79, from his chairA staff member at Newfield Nursing HomeA carer brings food to a resident at Newfield Nursing HomeJack Dodsley, 79, with a carer in PPEA staff member puts on PPE at Newfield Nursing HomeJackie Wilson, a healthcare assistant, puts on PPE before she enters a roomA bench at Newfield Nursing HomeJack Dodsley, 79, with a carer in PPE at Newfield Nursing HomeJackie Wilson, a healthcare assistant, wearing PPE before going into roomsJack Dodsley, 79, speaks to a carer at Newfield Nursing HomeCarers working at Newfield Nursing HomeJack Dodsley, 79, sits with a carerJack Dodsley, 79, with a carer in PPEA staff member at Newfield Nursing Home looks after a residentA carer helps Jack Dodsley, 79, from his chairA staff member at Newfield Nursing HomeA carer brings food to a resident at Newfield Nursing HomeJack Dodsley, 79, with a carer in PPEA staff member puts on PPE at Newfield Nursing HomeJackie Wilson, a healthcare assistant, puts on PPE before she enters a roomA bench at Newfield Nursing HomeThe TUC has called for the creation of a national recovery council to reshape the economy in the wake of the virus by offering a job guarantee scheme for young people as well as protecting public services, ending zero-hours contracts, and boosting the minimum wage and sick pay.Ms O’Grady expressed frustration at the government’s efforts to tackle race inequality in the UK, amid mounting evidence that black and minority ethnic people face a greater risk of dying from Covid-19.She said: “I think it’s about time the government looked at the facts that black and ethnic minority people are much more likely to work in key jobs where they’re more exposed to the virus, much more likely to be on zero-hours contracts, much more likely to be on low pay and can’t afford to take time off work when they’ve got symptoms, much more likely to face discrimination.”Ms O’Grady added: “The evidence has been out there for years.

Please consider a contribution or subscription.Wearing face coverings is to be compulsory on public transport in England from 15 June, with fines for those who refuse, transport secretary Grant Shapps has announced.Speaking at the daily Downing Street press conference, Mr Shapps said the move was designed to prevent an upsurge in coronavirus infections as the country moves to the next stage of lockdown relaxation, with non-essential shops allowed to reopen.Mr Shapps said wearing a face covering would be made a “condition of travel” on public transport, allowing passengers to be refused carriage if they do not comply, with the British Transport Police called in to deal with those resisting the rule where necessary. Face coverings are not currently included in the Health Protection Regulations which give the police legal power to take action over lockdown breaches. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesMr Shapps said: “As of Monday 15 June face coverings will become mandatory on public transport.“That doesn’t mean surgical masks, which we must keep for clinical settings. It means the kind of face covering you can easily make at home. There will be exemptions to these rules for very young children, for disabled people and those with breathing difficulties.”He added: “We need to ensure every precaution is taken on buses, trains, aircraft, and on ferries.”Seven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreak‘They can blame it for everything’: What coronavirus means for BrexitThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxDo you need a face mask and where can you buy one?UK lockdown: Can I see my family and friends under new rules?“With more people using transport, the evidence suggests wearing face coverings offers some – albeit limited – protection against the spread for the virus.”Frontline staff such as bus drivers will also be required to wear face coverings, and Mr Shapps said the government will work with devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to try to make the change nationwide.The announcement was welcomed by London mayor Sadiq Khan, who has long lobbied for mandatory face coverings on the capital’s Underground system.“I’m pleased that our lobbying has paid off and the government has finally seen sense and made it mandatory for people to wear face coverings on public transport,” said Mr Khan.Mick Whelan, general secretary of the train drivers’ union Aslef, agreed: “This is a sensible step. We have been working closely with the government to ensure that agreed increases in services on Britain’s train and Tube network is done in a safe and controlled manner, to help spread the loading, and maintain social distancing for the safety of passengers and staff.“The instruction to wear face coverings to help prevent the spread of the coronavirus will ease the concerns of people travelling, and working, on the transport network.”The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive updates on politics every morning by emailHowever, scientists are ided over the value of homemade face coverings.Dr Antonio Lazzarino, of the department of epidemiology and public health at University College London, warned that their use might encourage people to wash hands less and to make more use of buses and trains, where face coverings will offer no protection against them being infected by touching handrails contaminated with the virus.“It is now commonly accepted that face coverings provide very little protection, if any. But one clear, logical, widely accepted side effect is that face coverings may give an excuse to easing other more important measures,” said Dr Lazzarino.“Will more people use the Tube or buses because they will feel more secure given that everybody wears a face covering? This will increase the risk of transmission.“Will people be able not to contaminate their hands and the handrails by not touching their face coverings and not touching the handrails while standing inside buses and trains? This seems to be impossible to me. Face coverings can therefore be a vehicle of infection, rather than a barrier.”But health care professor Prof Trish Greenhalgh of the University of Oxford said: “Face coverings aren’t 100 per cent effective, but they’re not zero per cent effective either.“I’ve seen evidence that a double layer of cloth is between 60 and 90 per cent effective in stopping the spread of viral-laden droplets coming from the wearer, and also that the same mask is also 30-50 per cent effective at stopping virus particles getting to the wearer. You can argue about the exact percentages, but overall, if everyone wears a face covering when they’re at close quarters, transmission is going to go down dramatically.”Dr Simon Clarke, associate professor in cellular microbiology at the University of Reading, said: “This policy will add more burden on the general public to prevent the spread of Covid-19. This is much more complicated than ‘wash your hands for 20 seconds’ or ‘stay at home’. We are asking the whole population of Britain, with no prior experience of mask-wearing, to overnight become competent makers, wearers, and maintainers of PPE.“I have seen no new evidence to suggest why the government is reversing its previous policy, and ignoring its previous scientific guidance and the guidance of the WHO. I’m left wondering if this is a political decision, rather than one based on science.”Labour’s shadow transport secretary Jim McMahon said: “This is just another example of the government being slow to act. Two months ago, Labour immediately backed the Mayor of London’s call for face coverings on public transport to be compulsory. Yet only now Tory ministers are acting.“Two months after first raising this with government we are still yet to hear whether drivers will be issued with gloves, masks, and other PPE items as standard, what specification this PPE should be and, if there isn’t sufficient PPE, whether buses should still run.“We can’t go on like this. We need a comprehensive transport plan to get our public transport moving, to protect staff and to protect passengers.”Network Rail chairman Sir Peter Hendy said he expected most passengers to comply with the requirement to wear face coverings.“I am not expecting a huge upsurge in railway staff having to police this,” he told the No 10 briefing. “I am expecting sensible passengers to do their duty and look after themselves and others.”Mr Shapps said that if people refused to comply they could be fined under new provisions in the national rail conditions of travel and the public service vehicle regulations for buses.“It is a condition of travel. You cannot travel unless you are wearing a face covering,” he said. “There will also be other powers so it could ultimately lead to fines. I very much hope we won’t be in that situation.”He said he did not expect enforcement action to be required on a regular basis, saying: “I expect the vast majority of people won’t need to be forced into this, because wearing a face covering helps protect others and most people simply want to help defeat this disease.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

First elected as an MP only in 2017,  Ms Moran insists her lack of experience could be a boon to the Lib Dems at a low point in their history. After the highs of “Cleggmania” in 2010, when the party was briefly riding high in the polls, the party came down to earth with a bump in 2015. Accusations of hypocrisy over the party’s support for tuition fees and other policies led to a slump in voter trust, leading to most of the party’s MPs losing their jobs. A pro-Brexit stance saw a revival in its fortunes in last year’s European parliament elections but a disastrous general election campaign saw its seat tally, which had been bolstered by defectors, fall again, to 11.

Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive updates on politics every morning by emailMs Moran, the MP for Oxford West and Abingdon, says the message she has received from voters is that post-Brexit her party is “struggling for an identity”.       Asked if she thought the fact she had not been a part of the coalition government would be helpful, she said: “I think it would. And the reason why is that it sends the signal. I don’t intend to pretend that our party was not part of that coalition. It  was, it was part of our history. And it is really important that we learn the mistakes from it. And the big mistake was, of course, that you don’t as a politician say one thing and do another. We lost trust and we never really won it back. And it is unfair you could argue that it is still the yoke around our necks that it is.“And I would say to people, imagine what we can do with me as leader, without the yoke of coalition, moving forwards.”She says she wants the public to “realise that the Liberal Democrats are on their side” and fears they don’t instinctively.  She is keen to listen to voters, if elected. “I started my leadership election by touring the country listening to voters not in London in the southeast. And that’s what I would like to spend the first year of my leadership doing. Finding a message that resonates, in all parts of the country, making the case for liberal values.”She opposed Brexit and has called on the government to extend the transition period, amid fears a no-deal exit this December could batter an economy still reeling from the coronavirus crisis. But Lib Dems hoping she will campaign immediately to rejoin the European Union will be disappointed. Instead, she wants the party to focus on three main areas: education the environment and the economy including creating an economy with well-being at its heart. She fears the UK has gone backwards on social mobility, of the kind of which she benefited. “Inequalities have grown to such an extent that basic social mobility, the kind of social mobility that meant my father was the first in his family to go to university and then became an ambassador, just doesn’t exist anymore,” she said.“Young people in this country are deeply frustrated with the way the markets are working ... I think those who are crying out for a fairer economy that actually makes it work for real people are on the right track.”Last week Mr Davey called for a citizen’s basic income to help support carers as he launched his leadership campaign.The other declared challenger is the party’s environment spokeswoman Wera Hobhouse, another MP who entered parliament after the coalition years.  A postal ballot of Lib Dem members will take place over the summer, with the winner announced on 26 August.

Please consider a contribution or subscription.China has removed pangolin parts from its list of traditional medicines, state-backed media reported, in a move campaigners say is a vital step in helping to protect the endangered animal.Pangolins – the world’s most trafficked mammal  – are highly sought after in China and Vietnam for their meat which is considered a delicacy, while their scales are used in traditional medicine and folk remedies.Similar in size to domestic cats and the only mammal covered in scales, all eight pangolin species are protected under international laws but there remains a growing illegal trade of the animals. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThis week health authorities omitted pangolin scales from China’s latest Pharmacopoeia, an approved list of traditional drugs and remedies due to “wild resources exhaustion”, according to a report in the Health Times.WildAid CEO Peter Knights said the move was “the greatest single action that could have been taken to save pangolins from extinction.”“The increased protection coupled with the swift and comprehensive closure of live wildlife markets and removal of many wild species from the list of what can be consumed as food in China were already very positive steps to saving the pangolin worldwide and reducing the possibility of them ever being a vector for disease.“And now this announcement, effectively the closure of legal sales of pangolin scales, shutting the last major loophole in pangolin protection efforts,” he added.People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) welcomed China’s decision, but urged action to stop the sale of pangolins on the black market. “PETA gives a nod to China for taking an important step to combat the demand for pangolin scales,” director Elisa Allen told The Independent.“However, as long as it remains desirable and profitable for endangered animals’ body parts to be sold for medicine, wildlife will continue to be killed on the black market.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Some scientists believe they may incubate the Covid-19 virus that is thought to have emerged in Wuhan last year and has since swept the globe.Scientists find virus similar to Covid-19 in pangolinsFollowing the outbreak of coronavirus at the end of last year, China banned the consumption of all wild animals in a bid to prevent further outbreaks but many wet markets have since reopened.Earlier this year, The Independent renewed its call for the banning of trade in wild animals to help protect endangered species and avoid future pandemics.“These actions of China will have a real impact, these are steps that were critical, that needed to be taken if real conservation was going to happen for these animals,” said David Olson, director of Conservation at WWF Hong Kong.“Most of the demand for pangolin is coming from traditional Chinese medicine and consumption.

Please consider a contribution or subscription.It is widely regarded as the original sin of the west’s post-war Middle East policy a coup that squelched a people’s democratic aspirations and ultimately led to the calamitous rise of the militaristic nationalism and Islamic extremism that shape the region today. Nearly 67 years ago, the popular nationalist government of Iranian prime minister Mohammad Mossadegh was toppled with the aid of British and American spies seeking to reinstal the Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi as absolute ruler of Iran. A quarter century later, in 1979, his rule too would be ended, by Islamist clerics and activists who inspired movements across the region.Over the decades the event has taken on a mythical quality, the conspiracy that launched all other conspiracy theories. Of course, say people across the Middle East, western intelligence is behind everything from the rise of al-Qaeda and Isis to valuations of local currencies. Just look at how they toppled the government in Iran when it sought to nationalise its oil industry in the early 1950s in defiance of British imperial power.  Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesBut in recent years, historians around the world poring over documents released from official archives have repeatedly revised assessment of what transpired. Some have argued that Mossadegh was on his way out already, and that a local alliance of pro-Shah goons, business interests and conservative clerics opposed to his left-leaning policies was already on the verge of taking him out. Yet another set of reassessments concluded that, rather than a case of derring-do by slick spies, the coup was a badly planned and nearly botched accident that was more John Cleese than John le Carre. Split between Trump, Pentagon and military top brass laid bareIran fears second wave as coronavirus infections rise to record-highUS Navy veteran detained in Iran for two years en route homeThe assessment of the two historians behind the Channel 4 documentary airing on Sunday, The Queen and the Coup, falls in the latter category, that the ultimate success of the coup which was hatched in 1951 by British spies seeking to keep control of Iran’s oil was more a comedy of errors than a smooth operation. Never-before-seen documents unearthed by historians Rory Cormac and Richard Aldrich show how the name of the young Queen Elizabeth was abused at a key moment to “help destroy Iran’s democracy”, as the documentary says.  In the months-long crisis and period of scheming preceding the August 1953 coup, the young Shah, who had been a western protege of London and Washington and their global plans for countering the Soviet Union, was planning on leaving the country and heading into exile fearing the unrest brewing in the country. Aldrich and Cormac found documents showing that at a key moment the US received a note to the Shah from then-British foreign secretary Anthony Eden that seemed to suggest that Queen Elizabeth herself was making a rare intervention into foreign policy to urge him to stay put. Knowing how much the Shah had sought a formal alliance with the British monarchy, the US ambassador in Tehran passed on the note to the royal court.But later it emerged that the note was garbled, and that it was Eden himself aboard the RMS Queen Elizabeth ocean liner that was urging the Shah to stay in Iran.The Americans realised they had made a mistake but decided to cover it up from both the Brits and the Iranians. “They don’t want the Shah to realise that essentially he’s been misinformed, perhaps even unintentionally duped,” Aldrich, professor of International Security at the University of Warwick, says in the documentary.

Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailThe Shah’s decision not to go into exile gave western intelligence operatives of the MI6 and the CIA’s Kermit Roosevelt time to plan and scheme. The UK plan to overthrow Mossadegh and replace him with an authoritarian regime led by the Shah was called Operation Boots. The Americans called their scheme Operation Ajax. Six months later Mossadegh was ousted as pro-Shah mobs took over the streets and a crisis caused by a US and UK blockade strangled the economy.“I think what we found is an important revelation that brings the Queen into the picture,” Cormac, a professor of International Relations at the University of Nottingham, said in a telephone interview. “Had the Shah fled at the time, the MI6 coup planning wouldn’t have taken place.”Once back in power, the newly emboldened Shah launched a 25-year reign of terror. Leftists, liberals and Islamists alike were thrown for years into torture chambers as the increasingly grandiose monarch squandered the nation’s oil wealth on pricey American weapons systems. His regime ultimately ended in one of the most cataclysmic revolutions in world history, giving birth to the most avowedly anti-western regime on the planet. It’s important to put the events surrounding the coup and its aftermath into perspective. Iran in 1953 was a flawed constitutional democracy Mossadegh, the country’s most popular politician, had been nominated by the Shah and elected by a democratically elected parliament in 1951, and the country might have beat an unsteady path to democracy regardless of whether Mossadegh had been ousted.Islamic fundamentalism did not take root in the Middle East because of Iran’s revolution it had antecedents throughout the region, and the 1967 defeats of Arab nationalist leaders at the hands of Israel arguably played a greater role in the rise of religious extremism. What the revelations that have emerged do show is the extraordinary luck of the British and Americans. Sweeping the crucial facts behind their accidental success in Iran under the rug gave them license to continue attempting to destabilise countries for decades afterwards.  In the years after the coup, and drunk on extremely flawed stories of its own successes in Iran, the MI6 used subterfuge and treachery to attempt to topple regimes in Syria, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Yemen. “The Foreign Office at the time was not really pro-covert operations they were trying to rein MI6 in,” said Cormac, who specialises in the history of intelligence services. “When this operation happened, they brought Kermit Roosevelt back to London on a victory tour.

Some schools reopened on  June following coronavirus guidelines.Additionally, some schools have remained partially open to care for the children of key workers.The provision is intended to ease the childcare burden and allow key workers to stay at work.The Department for Education has said parents should keep children at home unless their work is critical to efforts to combat the epidemic.Yesterday, we backed a proposal by Lord Ashcroft to honour our health heroes with the gallantry gong given for acts of bravery that did not take place in battle.A No spokesman said: “The NHS is doing a fantastic job and the nation will want to find a way to say thank you when we have defeated this virus.”SAS hero Andy McNab added: “The award of a George Cross would show an emotional appreciation.”We are asking readers to sign the petition online at thesun georgecrossfornhs. More than half a million people signed up to volunteer in the NHS to ease additional pressure during the outbreak.The drive had initially been for , people.Volunteers are delivering food and medicines, driving patients to appointments, and phoning those who are isolated.Volunteers are being asked not to participatethey or anyone  in their household is currently showing symptoms of the coronavirus orthey have an underlying health condition.Groups of up to six people may meet, socially distanced, in the park.Two households may also mix, socially distanced, in their gardens.Modern technology will make staying in touch with friends and family a lot easier than it once would have been.Among the options available are:The Government has extended the lockdown for a further three weeks after Boris Johnson first introduced the measures on March .Dominic Raab said the restrictions would stay in place until it passes five key test.He added that the UK was still on course to take three months to come out of the current peak — taking the lockdown to June.The Prime Minister Boris Johnson revealed that single people living alone - or with children under  - can form a support bubble with another family or household from June .It will mean grandparents who live alone can finally see their grandchildren again.And single parents with kids can form a bubble with another house too - so they can stay overnight, help with childcare or provide much needed support.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

In her case, it’s not pretty.Where to start  How about son number two who, thanks to his friendship with billionaire paedophile Jeffrey Epstein is now embroiled in an ugly, cross-Atlantic ding dong with an American legal system that kowtows to no one.Clearly, Andrew hoped his royal status might ensure discretion. But the US Department of Justice has other ideas and has now publicly accused him of lying when he says he has offered to co-operate with their inquiries into Epstein’s questionable activities.It’s uncertain whether The Queen and Prince Philip have Netflix in their lockdown lair at Windsor Castle, butthey have watched the documentary Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich — in which their reportedly favourite son is mentioned many times — they will have spat out their popcorn.Aside from the well- documented claim by Virginia Roberts that she was trafficked to London at the age of  to have sex with Prince Andrew , one of the most damning accusations is the alleged sighting of him at Epstein’s private island where airport staff now say that the billionaire, who allegedly killed himself last year, frequently arrived with “underage girls”.Ordinary people staying schtum at the time for fear of losing their jobs is one thing but the silence of the many powerful men who enjoyed Epstein’s hospitality is quite another.Prince Andrew is undoubtedly one of them and, at the very least, he owes it to Epstein’s survivors to sit down with the US Department of Justice and reveal what he does, or doesn’t, know.And asthat’s not enough to give his mother sleepless nights, he and his ex-we Sarah Ferguson are also being sued for a £.million unpaid debt on a Swiss ski chalet.Meanwhile, son number oneis happy enough in his second marriage, but reportedly harbouring a deep sadness that one of his sons has chosen to leg it to the US, along with the baby grandson he can no longer hug.On top of that, he faces forking out millions to help Harry and Meghan pay for personal protection because not only have they chosen to settle down in paparazzi central, but in a country where the gun culture means any nutter can wander into a store and arm up as easily as buying a microwave.Son number threehas just announced that his children won’t use royal titles and will work for a living.But one wonders whether, given the pressure to streamline the monarchy, they jumped before they were pushed.Daughter Anne is a reliable stalwart, but grandson Peter recently announced his marriage to we Autumn is over, and as for grandsons William and Harry, it’s fair to say that the reported fall-out of those two young brothers who walked so stoically behind their mother’s coffin must be causing The Queen great sadness.So, with all that going on with her nearest and dearest, how will she feel when lockdown finally lts and she’s expected to put on a brave face to the world again Will she think, “I’ve had enough” and, as was rumoured prior to the pandemic, abdicate on her th birthday next year Doubtful, given that she pledged she would be of service “my whole le” and that, traditionally, British monarchs occupy the throne until death.But, given her family ructions, who could blame hershe did decide to call it a day If he had bodyguards with him on his ious visits to Epstein, then perhaps they could enlighten the US authorities on Andrew’s movements at the time Andhe didn’t, then why the hell does he need them now Asthe new, -day quarantine rule wasn’t daft enough, it’s emerged that police have been told to take “no immediate action”a passenger gives a  address on arrival in the UK.Right. So the only travellers affected by this ludicrous policy will be the law-abiding and public figures who risk being spotted on holiday then named and shamedthey don’t self-isolate upon .Everyone  can just give their details as Mickey Mouse of Taking The Mickey Street, and go about their le with impunity.Meanwhile, the airline industry is teetering on the verge of bankruptcy because it sends out the message that Britain is closed.Well. Done. Everyone.Prince Albert of Monaco has a problem – his subjects are getting too old.According to the BBC documentary Inside Monaco, it’s the most elderly country on Earth.So the principality has launched an “influencer” award aimed at attracting a younger “YouTube” generation who,the footage of their garish supercars is anything to go by, have money but zero taste.The awards are the brainchild of the prince’s friend . . .  . . .  Princess Camilla of Bourbon Two Sicilies, Duchess of Castro If Little Britain ever doesto our screens, she’s a shoo-in.Dancing On Ice is reportedly considering filming the show with two-metre social-distancing measures in place.If the rumours of their big fallout are true, last series contestant Caprice and her dance partner Hamish Gaman would have had no trouble with implementing it.Pixar’s animated movie Coco has been voted the most tear-jerking film of all time, with Marley  Me in second place and Schindler’s List in third.It was the result of a Twitter survey by US film critic Kevin Lee, who asked followers to tell him “the hardest you’ve ever cried in a movie TV show”.I haven’t seen Coco, but my weepiest, cinematic experience didn’t make the top ten.It’s Mask – starring Cher and Eric Stolz – a film that rendered me so inconsolable that the man in front of me askedI could “shut the hell up”.And Goodbye Mr Chips wasn’t far behind either – but at least I was home on the sofa for that one.Other than Leonardo DiCaprio browsing for a new girlfriend, who actually shops at underwear store Victoria’s Secret any more Not many Brits, it seems – its  UK stores have just gone in to administration.Back in the day, VS underwear was tasteful and good quality, but somewhere along the way it lost sight of its core customer.The owners clearly forgot that, while men lusted after the scantily-clad “Angels” such as Alessandra Ambrosio at its catwalk shows , it’s primarily women who buy lingerie.And the majority want “tastefully boudoir” not “garishly bordello”.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The tracer works for a customer management company called Sitel, who were tasked by the Government to help set up the track and trace system.The tracer spoke to the The Sun on condition of anonymity because workers were warned by Sitel not to speak out the chaos of the new system. The tracer added he had been paid £, so far despite not making a single phone call. He said the first group he worked in was made up of  people, and roughly  calls were made per day. The group he was later moved to had  people and had only made one phone call between am and yesterday afternoon. The staff had so little work to do, they were sent around games and quizzes including one asking them to describe what you look like when you dance. Another email told staff to share what they wanted for lunch in emojis.Officials say that some call handlers do have spare capacity - and that workloads are increasing.A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care said: These claims do not reflect the huge amount of successful work happening every day.“The NHS Test and Trace service is up and running and is helping save lives with over , people already advised to self-isolate.”Health Secretary Matt Hancock yesterday thanked the hard work of private companies such as Sitel for helping get the system off the ground. He said: The system is working well, we will keep improving it, it will keep getting better. It will be world class.

This movement is a catalyst for change, and right now, its telling us a lot of things need to be addressed so we can make space to heal, Starbucks said in a letter to employees announcing the new shirt design.Its critical to support the Black Lives Matter movement as its founders intended and will continue to work closely with community leaders, civil rights leaders, organizations, and our partners to understand the role that Starbucks can play, and to show up in a positive way for our communities, Starbucks said.In a video, which has since been removed, the company VP of inclusion and ersity explained before the new announcement of shirts that agitators who misconstrue the fundamental principles of the movement and could use them to amply isiveness.Pins representing “political, religious or personal issue[s]” have been included in the ban, sparking allegations of hypocrisy as the coffee chain hands out LGBTQ and marriage rights buttons to its workers.Calvin Bensen, a -year-old barista from Atlanta, told BuzzFeed News the company’s response was “disappointing in ways I can’t express in words. He added: That statement prioritises those who feel discomfort over Black lives.My skin color incites violence at Starbucks. Should I not come to work It is silencing and Starbucks is complicit. Now more than ever, Starbucks needs to stand with us.A Starbucks spokesperson told the outlet that the company is dedicated to helping end systemic racism,” but that the dress code policy would remainbecause it was necessary “to create a safe and welcoming” environment for customers and staff.We respect all of our partners’ opinions and beliefs, and encourage them to bring their whole selves to work while adhering to our dress code policy, the spokesperson said.One manager from a store in Washington said that he felt muted by not being able to visibly show his support at work.He explained: I work in a store where I am one of five people of color out of , and it would be nice to be able to show some sort of unity with them.The company often allows workers to wear accessories supporting marriage equality and LGBTQ rights.Twitter user @MireyaaAzelinn suggested Starbucks change its famed mermaid logo in response to the ban.She posted an image of the black goddess Yemaya, a black mermaid from Santeria and claimed that the current Starbucks logo is based on Yemaya.Starbucks claims its original logo is based on a siren from an ancient Norse woodcut.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He added: We are doing a review right now, and obviously as we make further progress, I hope to say more.His comments come days after new cases of coronavirus dropped to just over  - numbers not seen since March. The Scottish Secretary Alister Jack also said the rule should be cut in half as quickly as we can.Speaking on BBC Radio Scotlands Good Morning Scotland programme, he said todays dire economic figures - a drop in GDP of  per cent last month alone - showed the need to act quickly.Its critical to save peoples livelihoods we start opening up the economy as quickly as possible, he said.Headded: As soon as it is possible to do so with the R number suppressed, I would like to see it move to one metre.I think, to get back to something to near normal in the way that we conduct our lives and our businesses, as we see the virus recede, and weve seen this happen without any bad consequences in other European countries, we should move to one metre when the time is right.More tourism businesses would remain viablethe two-metre social distancing rule was halved, he argued.Ms Sturgeon tweeted today that she was also considering reducing the m rule in time.She said: If we can effectively eradicate COVID - and then control through Test  Protect  policies to mitigate against cases coming into country - we can restore much greater degree of normality. Decisions then about, eg, m v m are more possible. But first we must suppress eradicate.Boris Johnson has repeatedly suggested he wants to cut down the two metre social distancing rule.Everyone who doesnt live in the same household must stay apart from others to stop the spread of the virus.The prime minister’s official spokesman said the rule was being “kept under constant review”.It was reported today that the PM has been told by scientists the decision to cut it is his, and there is no magic number he can rely on to ensure people will be safe, The Times claimed.But as schools and shops open up, there are fears that the economy will continue to suffer thanks to the distance.Pubs, restaurants and bars are all on track to open from the start of July.But keeping two metres apart is likely to mean they cant reach anywhere near the capacity they need to in order to survive.Greene King chief executive officer Nick Mackenzie today urged the PM to slash the rule down to one metre.He stressed that a number of Greene King pubs will not be financially viable or able to open with current restrictions in placeEconomics fear millions of jobs could be lost in the hospitality sector as a result - and some businesses may have to close their doors for good.To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Therefore, we consider this risk of exposure also to be, at most, medium likelihood. This likelihood nevertheless is outweighed by that from other infected people in the household.The experts added: Cats and dogs are equally susceptible to the virus attaching to host cells, because of the structural similarity of the receptor protein, ACE, to the human receptor.Sage carried out a qualitative risk assessment after two dogs were infected with SARS-CoV- - the virus that causes Covid- - in Hong Kong.One was a -year-old Pomeranian and the other a German Shepherd whose owners had both contracted coronavirus.The dogs were tested on several occasions and nasal swabs were positive for the virus across repeat time points. Once the dogs had tested negative twice, they were released from quarantine but sadly the Pomeranian died two days later of unkown causes - but suspected to be due to stress.Meanwhile, a cat in Belgium also tested positive for the virus after its owner fell ill with Covid-.The cat had diarrhoea, respiratory distress and vomiting before the virus was detected in faecal samples.It prompted concerns that pets could be a route of transmission but experts concluded that the risk to Brits remained low.Sage said: There is still a considerable level of uncertainty about the roleany of companion animals in SARS-CoV- transmission. There are no surveillance data and any risk level relies on previous observations of seropositive animals in previous outbreaks, the precautionary advice from the OIE and the two cases in dogs in Hong Kong.Companion animals can have very close contact with their owners which could lead to exchange of respiratory fluid therefore, they may be exposed.Nevertheless, exposure may not lead to infectivity and infection in animals and the SARS-CoV- appears to be predominantly transmitted from human to human. Until more surveillance data are available, a precautionary risk level has been given.Reviewing the report, Prof James Wood, head of Department of Veterinary Medicine at the University of Cambridge, said:“Despite millions of people having had Covid-, the numbers of pets found to be ill or infected is still tiny. Put simply, our pet dogs and cats can catch Covid- from us, when they are living with us, but only do on very rare occasions.“The risks of owners catching Covid- because their pet dog or cat has it are very low.

Everyone should maintain good hygienic standards with their pets and wash their hands across the day, as is generally advised, to avoid the risks of them contaminating themselves.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Given the horric situation we are all in, our young carers are basically working   in their homes – making sure that the ones they love so dearly are cared for properly. That means cooking, cleaning, making sure there’s clean clothes, and much more. They are essentially running a household. Another good cause to receive funding is Carers Matter at Leicesteraposs Shama Women’s Centre.  It provides a range of services and activities for female carers from black and minority ethniccommunities. Carer Shaheena has been looking after her teenage son since he was born. She said caring made her feel very lonely and depressed at times  - but the project has helped give her a much-needed boost. She explained: Since Iaposve been coming to the carers cooking group at Shama Iaposve been able to meet other carers who feel the same, make new friends, and learn lots of new recipes, which I try out at home. I feel I can switch off and be myself. My son loves the dishes I make which is great. Iaposve also managed to have a few pampering sessions, including Indian head message at the Centre, which have helped me relax. I feel so much better and grateful to Shama for remembering carers. I really look forward to our cooking sessions and Iaposm also part of a WhatsApp group so I get to share recipes with my friends from the class.

Bosses are desperate to welcome back customers after losing £.billion a WEEK in sales during the shutdown of non-essential shops. But there’s an uncomfortable sense of boom or bust surrounding a day that may make or break a retail revival. Fears are growing that a nation now used to shopping online may never be won back to malls and precincts in numbers needed to spark a recovery. And there are serious worries for the future of a string of top names already teetering on the brink BEFORE Covid- hit our shores. All this just days after latest figures showed the British economy shrank by a fth in April – its biggest ever fall and twice as bad a dip as the s Winter of Discontent. Now we are in a summer of apprehension, with retailers needing a flood of bargain-hunting customers – only to face a controlled trickle under guidelines to keep everyone safe. Fashion chains forced to close by the virus are sitting on £billion of unsold stock and retailers including Next and Gap are offering cut-price deals to get shoppers spending again. But experts warn there could be chaotic queues outside many stores forced to limit shopper numbers to abide by the two-metre social distancing rule. And yesterday retail analyst Richard Hyman cautioned that any bounceback could be short-lived.  He said: “Superficially, it’s very compelling to say that we’ve all been stuck at home for months and we’re going to rush out to the shops. “But as long as social distancing is in place, shops are not going to make any money. Pavements are not that deep, where’s the queue going to go  “It’s nightmarish. It’s going to be virtually impossible for bricks and mortar retailers to avoid losses with social distancing. A cut to one metre will make it easier, but it won’t turn economic losses into gains. Retailers are desperate to turn stock into cash. “Butyour costs are up because you have to provide anti-virus screens, hand sanitiser and PPE for staff – andyour footfall is reduced – the numbers don’t stack up unless you charge people more.”  Helen Dickinson of the British Retail Consortium offered little more hope of an instant recovery. “The Government’s support – from its job retention scheme to loan guarantees and business rates holiday – has provided a vital leline, but more will be needed,” she said. “Many retailers are struggling to pay rent. Without more government intervention, many shops, large and small, will be forced out of business – leaving high streets and shopping centres empty.” Mothercare went bust in January while Debenhams, House of Fraser and Marks  Spencer all closed branches before the crisis.  Other retailers, including Topshop owner Arcadia, New Look, Carpetright and Homebase have been forced to seek legal agreements with landlords to shut stores and slash their rent bills to stave off insolvency. Joshua Bamfield of the Centre for Retail Research reckons some chains will stagger their branch reopenings. He said: “Many will want to see how this is going to work – not only from a profit and loss point of view but with social distancing too. They’ll wait to seethe Government gives in to calls to reduce it to one metre.  “The next couple of months will be key in terms of who survives. If firms have two quarters where revenues are very small and losses mount, they’ll have to do something about it, which may be closure given many were operating with signicant losses in .” The British Retail Consortium has drawn up a five-point guide for shoppers, backed by  chain stores, to avoid a new wave of infections. It urges us to queue sensibly, maintain social distancing, follow instructions inside and outside, stick to hygiene rules and respect shop staff.

From Winston Churchill to Nelson Mandela, it is feared the monuments will be targeted by either anti-racism or far-right protesters as Brits take to the streets following the death of George Floyd for a third weekend running. Mayor of London Sadiq Khan is warning people to stay at home for fear of violence sparked by far-right counter demonstrations, and ongoing coronavirus infection concerns. Police have imposed some strict guidelines, including a pm curfew cut-off time for the protests. In wake of unarmed black man Mr Floydaposs death in police custody in Minneapolis, Black Lives Matter protesters have rallied worldwide, calling for an end to racial injustices. The vast majority of people demonstrating have done so peacefully. Last weekend, protesters in Bristol captured headlines around the world last Friday when they tore down a statue of slave trader Edward Colston and threw it into the harbour. On the same day, a statue of Churchill in Parliament Square was defaced with graffiti claming he was racist. Now, amid fears of clashes between Black Lives Matter protesters and far-right groups, a number of key statues have been put in protective boxes. It comes after the Democratic Football Lads Alliance called on its supporters to descend on the capital to protect monuments. Here, we list some of the statues which have been covered up out of fear they will become targets - albeit for a iety of reasons.to get the Mirroraposs biggest and best stories delivered straight to your inbox at www.mirror email Winston Churchill  Former Prime Minister Winston Churchill is best known for leading Britain to victory in World War Two. The Conservative politician is described on the governmentaposs website as an inspirational statesman, writer, orator and leader. But critics have pointed to his views on race and imperialism, and he is known to have described Britainaposs empire as being for the good of the primitive and subject races. He also opposed Indian independence. Ahead of planned protests in London this weekend his statue has been covered with protective boards. The move has been described by Boris Johnson as absurd and shameful. The Prime Minister says that although Churchill held some views that would be unacceptable today, he saved the country from fascist and racist tyranny. Cenotaph  Part of the official war memorial to Britainaposs war dead, which stands in Whitehall, has also been hidden from view. It comes after the monument was defaced, along with Churchillaposs statue, during last weekaposs Black Lives Matter march. Graffiti with the letters BLM was sprayed on the base of the memorial, where wreaths are laid on Remembrance Sunday each year. It has now been boarded up to protect it from further vandalism, and Mr Johnson has urged protesters not to turn out this weekend. A growing minority unfortunately have hijacked them and they are using them as a pretext to attack the police to cause violence and to cause damage to public property, he said. My message to everybody is for all sorts of reasons, they should not go. You should not have a situation where people who are protesting on one basis are violently attacking the police and public property. Robert Baden-Powell  A statue of Scouts founder Robert Baden-Powell has long stood in Poole Quay, Dorset. The monument was scheduled to be put into storage on Thursday due to concerns about Baden-Powellaposs associations with the Nazis and the Hitler Youth. But the removal was delayed after a crowd of people - some wearing Scout unorms - gathered around the statue and vowed to protect it. It comes after a petition calling for the memorial in Poole Quay to stay in place gained more than , signatures. Mark Howell, deputy leader of Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole Council said many felt that removing the status would be giving in to protesters. Guyaposs and St Thomasaposs Hospital Trust has confirmed that it will be taking down a statue of its founder, who had links to the slave trade. Workmen placed  of wood around the structure on Thursday. Guy - who founded the London hospital in  - amassed a fortune of £,as a shareholder in the slave-trading firm South Sea Company. A statement from Guyaposs and St Thomasapos Charity, Guyaposs and St Thomasapos NHS Foundation Trust, and Kingaposs College London, said: Like many organisations in Britain, we know that we have a duty to address the legacy of colonialism, racism and slavery in our work. We absolutely recognise the public hurt and anger that is generated by the symbolism of public statues of historical figures associated with the slave trade in some way. We have therefore decided to remove statues of Robert Clayton and Thomas Guy from public view, and we look forward to engaging with and receiving guidance from the Mayor of Londonaposs Commission on each. We see the pervasive and harmful effects of structural racism every day through our work. Black people have worse health outcomes, and this inequality is one of many ways racism permeates our society. We are fully committed to tackling racism, discrimination and inequality, and we stand in solidarity with our patients, students, colleagues and communities. Nelson Mandela  Mayor of London Sadiq Khan instructed Nelson Mandelaaposs statue in Parliament Square to be covered. The monument has stood in honour of the anti-apartheid leader, who was President of South Africa from  to , since . The countryaposs first black head of state, Mandela was imprisoned for  years on Robben Island while fighting to end institutionalised racial segregation. The move comes amid fear of counter protests from extreme far-right groups this weekend. Mr Khan said: Iaposm extremely concerned that further protests in central London not only risk spreading Covid-, but could lead to disorder, vandalism and violence. Extreme far-right groups who advocate hatred and ision are planning counter-protests, which means that the risk of disorder is high. Be in no doubt these counter-protests are there to provoke violence, and their only goal is to distract and hijack this important issue. Staying home and ignoring them is the best response this weekend. Mahatma Gandhi  Along with Churchill and Mandela, a statue of Indian independence leader Mahatma Ghandi is also being boarded up in Parliament Square. Gandhi, famous for his role in securing Indiaaposs independence through nonviolent protest, is widely considered the father of his country. But there have been calls to remove a number of his monuments in the UK, as campaigners accused him of aposracismapos. A bronze statue was unveiled in Leicester in  and a third was put up in Manchester in  despite objections. A petition against the Leicester statue describes Gandhi as a fascist, racist and sexual predator who has brought inconsolable suffering. Robert Peel  Authorities have also decided to protect keep a statue of Sir Robert Peel in Tamworth, Birmingham - but this time over fears it might be confused with another. The memorial appeared on a website called ‘Topple the Racists’, which maps statues of historic figures whom it opposes. Peel actually served as a minister in the Government which made slave trading an offence. Danny Cook, leader of Tamworth Borough Council, said: “Given the current national focus on memorials, including statues of Robert Peel, we feel it necessary to take extra precautions to protect Tamworth’s -year-old Peel monument for the time being and fence it off.

The report states that the risk of pets transmitting the virus to humans is aposmediumapos - although the risk was aposhighapos for those with underlying health problems or poor immune systems. SAGE carried out a risk assessment after two dogs were infected with the virus in Hong Kong and a cat in Belgium also tested positive after its owner fell ill with Covid-. For the latest on the coronavirus pandemic, read our liveblog here  After looking into the risks, SAGE reported that there was a high level of uncertainty in a link with pets passing the virus to humans.The report states: Until more information is available on the likely infection status of a companion animal in contact with an infected SARS-CoV- patient, we consider the likelihood of exposure to be at most, medium, with a high level of uncertainty. There is still a considerable level of uncertainty about the roleany of companion animals in SARS-CoV- transmission. There are no surveillance data and any risk level relies on previous observations of seropositive animals in previous outbreaks, the precautionary advice from the OIE and the two cases in dogs in Hong Kong.  Companion animals can have very close contact with their owners which could lead to exchange of respiratory fluid therefore, they may be exposed. Nevertheless, exposure may not lead to infectivity and infection in animals and the SARS-CoV- appears to be predominantly transmitted from human to human. Until more surveillance data are available, a precautionary risk level has been given. While a link has been found SAGE said there was actually a bigger risk of humans giving the virus to their pets in the first place. In response to the report Professor James Wood, Head of Department of Veterinary Medicine, and researcher in Infection dynamics and control of diseases, University of Cambridge, said : The paper reiterates what we know, which is that despite millions of people having had COVID, the numbers of pets found to be ill or infected is still tiny.Put simply, our pet dogs and cats can catch COVID from us, when they are living with us, but only do on very rare occasions. “The paper also looks into the risks of pets transmitting COVID to owners and findsthat the risks of owners catching COVID because their pet dog or cat has it are very low.

It comes after scientists advised against bubbles being introduced as they could create apossignicant unwanted effectsapos. However, the Government decided that from today, people living alone in England can form bubbles with another household. Northern Ireland is adopting a similar relaxation of the regulations for people living alone. In a report of its meeting on May , published yesterday, the Scientic Advisory Group for Emergenciesadvised strong caution to introducing social bubbling and said it could not be seen as a universal good. But the SAGE report said that while larger households social bubbling together posed a signicant potential risk, bubbling may be appropriate in limited circumstances. How the social aposbubblesapos will work Who is covered by the new arrangements  Adults living alone or single parents living with children under the age of . What will they be able to do that they could not before  They can form a bubble with one other household which means they will effectively be treated as a single household for the purpose of the lockdown rules. That means they can visit each other indoors in their homes - staying overnightthey wish - and they will not have to observe the two-metre social-distancing rule. These bubbles are strictly exclusive - neither household can form a bubble with anyone .  Who might benefit Elderly people living alone could form a bubble with the household of an adult son or daughter enabling them to visit and even hug their grandchildren for the first time since lockdown. Single parents could pair up with their own parents allowing them to share childcare duties and reuniting grandparents and grandchildren. Couples who do not live together will be able to visit and to stay with each other. If one half of a couple shares a flat or house with one or more other people, they can see their partner as long they live alone -their partner also shares a home they cannot see each other. Andseveral people share a flat or house and all have partners who live alone, only one will be able to see their partner, which could lead to some interesting conversations. This will affect large numbers of young people living in towns and cities.  What about households where both grandparents are still living - can they now visit their children and grandchildren  At this stage onlytheir son or daughter is the only adult in the other household in the bubble. Andthe grandparents have two or more children who live alone, they will have to choose between them. Downing Street has acknowledged not everyone will benefit from the change although officials have hinted a further loosening of the rulesthe coronavirus outbreak continues to decline. Can households form more than one bubble  No. The arrangement must be exclusive with no switching of bubble partners. Will people have to formally register these bubble arrangements  No, it will be taken on trust. No  says the public has shown great responsibility in following the social distancing rules so far. Is there any limit on the distance between households in a bubble  Again no, although officials are suggesting people should try to stay local where possible.  What about vulnerable people who are shielding due to their age or health problems  At the moment, officials say it is too soon for them to be able to join support bubbles. What about parents who are separated but who currently share childcare with the children moving between the two households  That will continue. If the parents are the only adult in the household they can form a bubble with another household - meaning the children could potentially be in two bubbles, one for each parent. What happenssomeone in a bubble develops coronavirus symptoms  All members of both households in the bubble must self-isolate for  days. Does this apply only to England A scheme in Northern Ireland has also been brought in from Saturday. This is for a person who lives alone, and can visit someone aposs private dwelling, including staying one or more nights. If they have a child or children living with them they do not qualy. This will be be reviewed on Monday.  What do the scientists say  A SAGE report of its meeting on May  said: Sage advised that social bubbles have the potential to create signicant unwanted effects and advised against their introduction in the short term, when other distancing measures have only just been lted or in conjunction with release of other measures. Sage advised strong caution concerning the introduction of social bubbling - particularly in the short term, when other distancing measures have only just been lted or in conjunction with release of other measures. Sage has advised previously against making too many changes at once. Sage concluded that bubbling may be appropriate in limited circumstances. The report was published a day before adults living alone or single parents in England will be allowed to mix with one other household. Further reports to SAGE, also published on Friday, warned that breaching support bubbles could lead to a signicant risk of increasing transmission.

The picture - taken amid violent clashes between far-right protesters and police - has sparked widespread outrage, a campaign to identy the man dubbed an embarrassment to Britain, and calls for him to be sent to prison. It happened as hooligans and far-right groups claimed they were there to protect statues and memorials. An investigation has been launched by the politan Police. MP Tobias Ellwood, who gave first aid to PC Palmer as he lay dying after being stabbed to death in the grounds Parliament by Islamist terrorist Khalid Masood in , said the image of the man urinating next to the memorial was abhorrent. The Tory MP for Bournemouth East and chairman of the Defence Select Committee, tweeted a picture of the man and wrote: Absolute shame on this man. Click here to follow our live blog with the latest updates from the violent clashes in central London. Of all the images to emerge over these few testing days I find this one of most abhorrent. Please help identy him. Mr Ellwood later told Sky News:is an embarrassment to Britain. In an interview with the BBC, he said the man should come forward and apologise, adding that he was disgusted and the image was one of the most disturbing he has seen. Mr Ellwood said: We are going through a very dficult period of self-reflection here, quite rightly for us to look back and have a long overdue debate of our complex past and perhaps be more aware and critical of our own history. He added: But the minority far-right groups wanting to come to London on the pretext of defending monuments, and yet we see monuments such as this being treated in this way, shows how far this generation still has to go.  When asked whether he thought the urinating man may not have noticed the memorial, Mr Ellwood said: I donapost agree with that at all. This is the gates of Westminster, the most iconic symbol of democracy in the world next to a monument for Pc Keith Palmer. He was fully aware of what he was doing, he should step forward and apologise. These images are seen across the world, they will damage Britainaposs reputation. It will make us look like we are not in control. He agreed with the Home Secretaryaposs comments of using the full force of the law against the unruly protesters, adding: We must absolutely be firm on these people who choose to come to London and defend these statues but actually come here on the pretext of attacking the police and pursuing other agendas. Commander Bas Javid, of politan Police, said the force has launched an investigation. He said: “We are aware of a disgusting and abhorrent image circulating on social media of a man appearing to urinate on a memorial to PC Palmer. “I feel for PC Palmer’s family, friends, and colleagues. “We have immediately launched an investigation, and will gather all the evidence available to us and take appropriate action.” The politan Police Federation chairman, Ken Marsh, condemned the disorder and unruliness, and suggested the man pictured urinating next to the memorial should be sent to prison.  He said: Itaposs horrendous. The man urinating next to Keith Palmeraposs memorial is disgusting. A faction of people today [Saturday] only had one intention - to be violent and unlawful, they didnapost come here to protect the statues, itaposs just disorder and unruliness. I suggest serious custodial sentences in relation to assaults on police and others, criminal damage and urinating next to the memorial of heroes. Senior Tory MP Rob Halfon described the behaviour of a protester seen urinating by the memorial to PC Palmer as “horric”.  Mr Halfon, the chair of the Commons Education Committee, said he hoped the perpetrator was tracked down and jailed. “This is just so horric. I hope they find this inidual and lock them up and throw away the key,” he said. “This is not the kind of country we are. I feel every possible good wish to the family of PC Palmer, who did so much to keep us safe.” Scotland Yard said that as of pm on Saturday, they had arrested five people for offences including violent disorder, assault on police, possession of an offensive weapon, being drunk and disorderly and possession of Class A drugs. Several hundred demonstrators, mostly white men, attended the protest organised by far-right groups, including Britain First, which claimed they wanted to protect statues such as Winston Churchill from vandalism. But fights erupted in areas near the Houses of Parliament and Trafalgar Square, as demonstrators repeatedly assailed officers with foul-mouthed chants and missiles, smoke grenades and flares. Shards of glass were strewn along the streets close to the Cenotaph on Whitehall after bottles were thrown at police officers clad in riot gear.  The violent scenes are in contrast with peaceful demonstrations that took place at Hyde Park and Marble Arch by anti-racism protesters in support of the Black Lives Mattermovement. On Friday, statues in Parliament Square - including of Winston Churchill, Nelson Mandela and Mahatma Gandhi - were boarded up to prevent them being targeted by protesters both from the Black Lives Matter movement and far-right groups. The politan Police warned people joining demonstrations on Saturday that they must be off the streets by pm or risk being arrested. At around pm, the crowd in Parliament Square thinned out after one of the exits was opened, although a few hundred people remained in the area ahead of the pm deadline. The violence has been condemned by the Mayor of London Sadiq Khan and Home Secretary Priti Patel, with the latter branding it as thoroughly unacceptable thuggery.

He cradled grandad Pat Evans, , in his dying moments and was praised by a coroner for his “extraordinary courage” in trying to save him. Last year Owen met the Duke of Sussex at the unveiling of a monument to the victims in Birmingham. It was an emotional moment he will never forget. Speaking about it for the first time with mum Suzanne Richards, Owen, now , says: “He gave me some advice. “He said I must talk about what happened. He said he knew personally, because when he lost his mum, he didn’t. It was a bit weird when he said, ‘when my mum was killed’, because she’s not just any mum – she’s Princess Diana. It seemed like he was trying to give some advice rather than have a meaningless conversation.” Owen got chatting to the Prince after giving a speech at the unveiling. He said: “I was nervous but Harry nodded during my speech. Mum and I had a teddy from our charity Smile for Joel – named after my brother – which we gave to him for his we who was pregnant.“I told him I was there when it happened and how I lost my brother, my grandad and my uncle.” Owen’s le changed forever when a celebration trip for finishing his GCSEs turned into a terrying nightmare. He was staying at the five-star Riu Imperial Marhaba Hotel in Port El Kantaoui with Joel, , uncle Adrian Evans, , and grandad Pat. They had nicknamed the trip the Jolly Boys’ Outing – after their favourite episode of sitcom Only Fools and Horses.Owen recalls texting his mum that they had got there safely and next morning the family relaxed by the pool. But less than  hours later crazed gunman Seeddine Rezgui, a -year-old Tunisian student, walked into their lives and opened fire. What followed next still remains a blur. Sports science graduate Owen finds it painful to recall the horrors that unfolded on June , . The four men tried to run inside the hotel complex to escape, but Pat fell over several times.  Owen was hugging his grandad on the floor when he was shot for the first time. Pat said: “He got me.” Owen, who himself was shot in the arm, urged him to play dead but the gunman fired again at Pat, a retired Justice of the Peace. Owen crawled along the floor to find his brother, tipped to be a future Premier League referee, and his uncle, a gas services manager, both leless in pools of blood. Shocked Owen later called mum Suzanne, , from the hospital and blurted out: “They’re all dead.” College lecturer Suzanne, who was at home in Wednesbury, West Mids, said: “All I could hear was screaming after that. Then the line fell silent. My knees buckled and I fell to the floor. My phone started pinging with messages telling me to switch on the news.  “An image of Owen flashed up – he was getting out of an ambulance. I was shaking like a leaf and in deep shock.” Owen, who had been shot in the arm, rang again and said: “I want to come home, Mum.” Suzanne had to break the devastating news to her mum Maureen, . She said: “She was on her knees, heartbroken. I just had to get to Owen. I still had hope the others were alive because you just don’t want to believe it.” Suzanne and a friend boarded a special flight chartered to pick up survivors andthem home – and the pair found they were the only ones aboard. They dashed to the hospital to find Owen on a bed in his swim shorts. Suzanne said: “I wrapped him in a hug and sobbed. I said, ‘I’m here. You’re safe now’. He looked broken.”  When Owen was discharged they were taken to a morgue where they were shown photographs of the victims. Suzanne’s worst fears were confirmed when Joel, Adrian and Pat’s pictures were there. She said: “I kept Owen in the other room, he’d been through enough. Seeing the pictures was horrendous.” A few days later, the three bodies were flown to military base Brize Norton in Oxfordshire. More than , people attended a joint funeral on July . Hundreds of tributes were also left outside Walsall FC’s Bescot Stadium, where the family had season tickets. Owen said: “The funeral was a really dficult day.”  It turned out he passed his GCSEs with flying colours on the same day, Suzanne said: “The three people he wanted to show his grades to weren’t there. They would have been so proud of him.” Owen and his mum had therapy but stopped because the sessions were “like picking at a scab”. They faced further heartache when Maureen died in , having never recovered from the trauma. The beloved family dog Max also died, lost without his owner Pat. But Owen said: “Memories come back every day. The other day I was cleaning my car and I thought of Ade, because we were both mad about cars. “I miss staying up at night watching comedies with Joel, and Mum telling us to be quiet. It’s the little things that hurt. Joel was really into Game of Thrones and I feel sad he didn’t get to see how it ended.

In her first live public engagement during the coronavirus lockdown, the monarch attended a parade by  socially distanced soldiers from the st Battalion Welsh Guards - including the first ever female guardsman to parade for the Queen’s birthday. Wearing a floral silk jade grey and dusty pink dress by Stewart Parvin outfit and hat by Rachel Trevor-Morgan, with the diamond leek brooch of the Welsh Guards, the Queen smiled broadly as she emerged onto the historic castle’s Quadrangle from the Sovereign’s Gate. Taking her seat on a dais, a raised  decorated with pink begonias and bay trees, Her Majesty looked on with pride at the assembled military outfit, accompanied by Vice-Admiral Tony Johnstone-Burt, Master of the Household, Lt Col Michael Vernon, Comptroller and Major Nana Twemasi-Ankrah, the Queen’s equerry. It is understood that other senior members of the royal family, including the Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge tuned in on the BBC to watch the spectacle from their homes in Birkhall, Aberdeenshire and Anmer Hall, Norfolk, respectively The Queen, , was greeted by a royal salute before watching military drills by the guardsmen who are used to standing shoulder-to-shoulder, but had specially adapted their manoeuvres to keep . metres apart, under the watchful eye of Lieutenant Colonel Henry Llewelyn-Usher, who commanded the ceremony.  The st Battalion Welsh Guards, who are currently on guard at Windsor Castle and have played a key role in the Covid- response, were due to have their Colour “trooped” at this year’s official birthday parade, Trooping the Colour, which traditionally takes place at Horse Guards Parade in London and involves more than  soldiers and  horses. Soldiers were chosen to take part who were either living in the Windsor area, on duty at the Castle or based in the nearby barracks, limiting the amount of travel required. Members of the public had been actively discouraged from travelling to Windsor so that the strict rules surrounding gatherings could still be adhered to. The Queen has previously attended Trooping the Colour at Horse Guards Parade during every year of her reign, except for  when it was cancelled due to a national rail strike.Today was the first time the sovereign’s birthday parade has been held at Windsor since  during the reign of Queen Victoria. Trooping the Colour has marked the official birthday of the sovereign since . A reduced Massed Band of the Household Division of  musicians, conducted by Lieutenant Colonel Simon Hoare played a series of Welsh tunes during the brief -minute ceremony including Men of Harlech and The Rising of the Lark. Trooping in slow and quick time, band members executed “feathering” at each end to ensure they maintained social distancing.  The Queen watched the Guards’ Colour being paraded and a second salute before departing. The event was televised live on the BBC, but took place entirely within the confines of Windsor Castle, with no viewing positions for the public due to coronavirus restrictions. A royal source said the Queen was “delighted” the spectacle was performed and “grateful” for the efforts of everyone who made it a reality. Garrison Sergeant Major Warrant Officer Class  Andrew Stokes, who oversaw the soldiers’ training for the unique ceremony, said: “The Army teaches iniduals many skills, but one of the greatest is teamwork, and this parade is a marvellous display of that: a collaboration of ideas and new thinking to celebrate the leadership of the Sovereign on her official birthday. With fewer people on parade there is no hiding place, there never is, and only the highest standard is acceptable, but more spacing between iniduals means there is also no room for errors, and so the soldier has to really concentrate on their own personal drill, reaction to orders, dressing and social distancing.” Guardsman Rhian Morgan from Newport, South Wales, is one of two female Guardsmen who joined the Welsh Guards earlier this year.She is the first female Guardsman to appear on a parade for The Queen’s birthday, although she has done several duties as Queen’s Guard at the Royal Palaces and was also involved in COVID- testing at Regional Testing Centre Chessington early in the pandemic.Women regularly appear on the Trooping of the Colour as musicians, members of The King’s Troop Royal Horse Artillery, supporting staff, veterinary officers, signallers and latterly in the Household Cavalry.

Claire-Louise Colquhoun, , desperately wanted to modernise the drab, beige kitchen of her three-bed home on a budget. The legal assistant from Ayrshire, Scotland, searched the internet for materials and DIY hacks and was able to complete the project in just one week for £. And the amazing transformation photos speak for themselves. Money-savvy Claireaposs biggest purchase was her laminate flooring which cost £. Unbelievably, the rest of the room was transformed simply using wallpaper , paint primer , cupboard paint , and vinyl worktop covering . Do you have a similar story to share  Email webnews@mirror The kitchen was my least favourite room when we moved in. It was boring and had no character. I wanted to make it modern whilst still keeping the costs down, Claire-Louise said. Iaposd seen on Pinterest that you could use a vinyl wrap on work surfaces. I used DC fix wrap which has held up really well around knives and hot pans. This is a great budget alternative to replacing worktops.  It is tricky when placing the vinyl wrap around the hob and sink but you do get the hang of it with practise. Iaposd recommend buying an extra-large roll in case you make a mistake. We learnt to use a credit card to smooth out any air bubbles and then a filing kne to make sure the material was flush to the wall tiles. For paint, make sure you use wood and furniture paint. Itaposs easy to wipeyou have any spillages. Both the paint and vinyl wrap have been extremely hardwearing.It took me ages to decide on the wallpaper as I was worried that it would make the kitchen look too dark but with the white units, it has the perfect balance. I did all of the DIY work with the help of my family so we didnapost have to pay any labour costs.

But even among this community, Christian Brueckner stood out. The German detested the “scruffy hippies”, as he called them, preferring to dress in old tailored suits. He also shunned their drug-fuelled lestyle, at least publicly, saying narcotics made him “lose control”. Brueckner apparently tried to portray himself as a gent, wooing women with his classic good manners. But behind the veneer there was a dark side to him, which remained hidden to even his closest friends. When he first arrived with a girlfriend in tow in , aged , he was already a convicted sex offender in Germany.  He had fled to Portugal after serving a two-year juvenile term for abusing a six-year-old girl in a playground and exposing himself to a nine-year-old girl when he was . And that was not his first brush with the law. Born Christian Fischer in Baia in , he was given up by his birth mother and placed in a children’s home, then adopted by Fritz and Brigitte Brueckner from Bergtheim, Baia. He was convicted of his first burglary in nearby Wuerzburg in , aged .  His adoptive parents sent him to a reform home for delinquent teens after Fritz was seriously injured in a car crash. In , Brueckner got an eight-month suspended juvenile term for multiple thefts and driving without a licence. After serving time for the later sex offences he started his new le in Lagos. He became a regular in the bars and clubs and was often seen at all-night parties in the hippy village of Barao de Sao Joao.He first came to the attention of Portuguese authorities in , when he was arrested following a bar brawl. He was handed a two-month jail term in Evora, near Lisbon, but was freed after a matter of weeks.  By the time he wooed a lonely -year-old English woman newly arrived in Lagos in , he had been in Portugal for almost a decade. As with previous girlfriends, he turned on the charm and played up to his “gentlemanly” image. The woman, now , told the Mirror: “At first I didn’t actually like him that much. I was , he was a couple of years younger. I knew he liked me but I wasn’t interested. But Chris could be very, very charming, very funny and very smooth in the way he talked. “He always dressed nicely, held the door open, that kind of thing. He drove the nice car – the black Jaguar – was very gentlemanly and spoke properly.  “I was alone in Portugal, no family around and a bit lonely. We became friends in the spring of  and that moved on to us becoming romantic. At first it was great.” The Mirror told this week how the woman, who does not want to be named, said he later changed. She claimed he flew into jealous rages, and allegedly smashed her head against a toilet wall in  after she hugged a male pal. She said she still lives in fear of him now. Shortly after their relationship began, Brueckner left his bar job and made money repairing classic cars. The woman, from Berkshire, said: “He liked taking me to the beach in his Jaguar. He didn’t like the town beach in Lagos. It would always be the West coast beaches, the isolated ones.  “He didn’t like lots of crowds. He didn’t like all the tourists in the summer.”She told how he once made her “strange German food” at his home. It is this house, situated on a hill ­overlooking Praia da Luz, that has become the focus of police attention. Brueckner moved out in , after receiving a nine-month prison term for petrol theft – a year before Madeleine McCann disappeared aged three from her family’s holiday apartment in the resort in May . A neighbour who cleaned up the property told last week how she found filthy conditions and bags of wigs and exotic clothes. This came as a surprise to his British ex, who remembered him being “house-proud”. But she also had an explanation for the items found.She said: “Chris loved to dress up, but not in a kinky way. He loved fancy-dress parties, especially Halloween, so he kept all sorts of outfits in the house. “He wasn’t into anything weird with me. We just had a normal sex le.” Despite his previous offences, his ex had no clue he was sexually attracted to young children. Instead, she and her pals in Lagos suspected Brueckner – now in a high-security German prison – had a thing for older women. She said: “There was one lady he used to take out to dinner sometimes, she was a bit older, and he said it was just for company. There was another lady, she was much older. He used to walk her dog and clean her apartment and she gave him money for that.” Months after they split in , Brueckner raped a -year-old woman in her Praia da Luz home. He was handed a seven-year jail term last year but is appealing his conviction.  His ex said Brueckner’s only passion, besides his cars, was making money. She said: “Other people get joy out of films, music, socialising, that sort of thing. But for him,there was no money to be made out of something, then there was no point doing it.” Brueckner was living in a camper van in the Praia da Luz area when Madeleine vanished from the Ocean Club resort. Police had him in their sights within five days and staff at the resort were shown his picture and name to seethey recognised him. But he only became a suspect in  when a caller to the German version of Crimewatch claimed he had hinted in a bar that he knew what had happened to Madeleine. In the intervening decade, Brueckner had regularly moved between Germany and Portugal. His German pals told the Mirror he had two dogs he treated so badly that one of them died.

It will be a massive plus that we have something to work to.“Every manager will probably tell you the same – we need a date for when we are going to go back.“But as I said, I am cautious because there is an awful lot going on at the moment, from where you can take your kids to when you can go and meet other people.“Everything is changing and I don’t think football will be any dferent.”Reconstruction plans have now been run up the flagpole and ripped back down again more than once.Consensus, as is so often the case in Scottish football, has proved impossible to reach.Meanwhile clubs like Dundee, whose business model means they sit uncomfortably in the Championship, have been left in limbo.It has affected everyone at the club – and their manager is growing tired of the uncertainty.However, McPake is conscious of the wider issues in today’s world, and his annoyance is tempered by realism.He said: “There is frustration but for me that can’t be put on anyone.“There is a frustration in every industry about where we find ourselves.“We have never been in a situation like this before and what that brings is a real level of uncertainty.“We are looking for answers every day. I would be very reluctant to blame that on a single person or organisation as you can see it right across the world at the minute. But yes, it is frustrating.“If you are looking at it purely from a footballing point of view it is really dficult for the players, for the backroom staff and for the fans.“But again there is a bigger picture here in terms of a health crisis.“We have to be guided by the government and the governing bodies in football but it has not been easy.“Everybody is in the same boat really and there are no real answers to what is happening and when we can get back to what is perceived as normal.“It is dficult – there is no other way of putting it.”For as long as the Championship remains without a definitive restart date, many elements of Dundee’s normal business operations will remain on hold. On the football side, that means recruitment and day-to-day work with players.They are crucial to any club’s success.But McPake insists he – and everybody  at Dens Park who is not furloughed – is doing everything he can to ensure as seamless ato action as possible.“I speak to Johna couple of times a week or maybe more but nothing has really changed,” he said. “We are where we are and there is no definitive date to when we can start back. It is not like a normal summer or break in the season like a winter one or international break.“There is always a structure to football and when you are back. The players, staff, everybody knows that but at the moment that has completely gone.“It is everyone’s longest lay-off – we are now getting to the stage where the players have been off the same amount of timethey had a serious injury so that brings its problems physically and mentally.“It is just about trying to get everything right so that when we do get the green light to start back we are in as good a position as possible.”EXCLUSIVE: Ex-Dundee striker Peter MacDonald confirms he’s hanging up his boots and says best day of his career came as a Dark Blues player\" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp dundee-fc-peter-macdonald-retirement-st-johnstone-rangers embed # secretWJcMNsFIpT\" data-secret\"WJcMNsFIpT\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

We knew we needed to improve his fitness.“Once we got him fit – we needed to get him up to scratch and keep him playing at the same time – and got into his head in terms of how we played, he was great for us.“He was brilliant at taking the ball, getting us up the park and running past defenders, his pace was a major asset.“I didn’t have a lot of hair at the time but I still lost a bit because he would drive you bananas at times with some of the silly things he’d do in good positions.“It goes without saying that he’s matured well beyond that now. He might have lost a bit of pace in recent years but he is a seasoned campaigner.“Back then he was desperate to come up to Scotland and play games.“The big thing we sold him on was the area, the lestyle – the tranquillity up here compared to the hurly-burly down south.“We told him he could get himself on the TV, sell himself in the big games and we were the type of club thatsomeone came in for you with a decent offer, you’d have the option to go.”Hayes – who started out at Reading – eventually left for Aberdeen in  after three years with Inverness.Over  games in five seasons and a League Cup winners’ medal in the Granite City followed before he clinched a £ million move to Celtic.The winger struggled to establish himself as a Hoops regular but he started several crucial games for the Scottish champions, including the  Scottish Cup final triumph over Hearts and the stunning Europa League victory over Lazio in Rome last November.Two months earlier he grabbed the second goal in the Old Firm derby as Neil Lennon’s side beat Rangers - at Ibrox.Hayes’ Parkhead exit – which has also led to interest from his former employers at Pittodrie – came less than two weeks after he picked up his third title medal in three campaigns with the club.Malpas said: “I thought Jonny would’ve got another contract at Celtic and that he would happily have stayed.“But maybe they’re trimming their squad a bit to get players in and maybe there wasn’t going to be the chance to play as many games next season.“He certainly didn’t let Celtic down when he was called upon.“For United, though, good on them for trying to sign Jonny. They’re clearly thinking about the right players and I think that’s the type of player they need.“He’s experienced and he’s played at a very good level. He’s still got pace, he can play in more than one position and he’s good in a dressing room.“I thinkyou were struggling in the middle of the pitch he could do a job there as well.“You’d never say he was the best defender, but he never seems to get a doing from the wide players he plays against.“Sometimes you think he isn’t the best at beating people yet he always seems to get crosses in.“For us at Inverness he was great at getting the ball in the box and created a lot of goals for guys like Adam Rooney.”The former United captain saw a transformation in Hayes during his time with the Dons.He added: “I’ve followed Jonny’s career for years and hoped he would do well.“He was great for us and did everything we asked. He’s one of the many guys you like to think you’ve helped a bit.“Jonny’s really matured and looked after his fitness. At Aberdeen he was playing under a bit more pressure in front of a more demanding crowd and that helped him make the move to Celtic.“He was a cheeky chappie when we had him –he got a bit of stick, he’d give a bit back. Some things used to affect him but I could see a dference at Aberdeen, he’d outgrown that and he could handle that.“We had a great group at Inverness. When we went in, we only kept three or four players and started again.“Graeme Shinnie was one of the kids that was there and he has developed into a right good player as well.“These guys would run through a wall for you and they were a joy to work with.“We didn’t have great facilities but these guys wanted to learn, they wanted to work and they had a great attitude.”Dundee United appoint senior club representative to liaise with Terrors fan groups\" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp dundee-united-fan-groups-liaison embed # secretNdKFhlJe\" data-secret\"NdKFhlJe\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

It was a case of this is what you are getting and there was nothing that could be done about it.#And when it came to the cemetery, the casket was taken from the hearse by parks department employees, none of whom wore any PPE,  and placed on top of the grave and lowered immediately before the civil celebrant service.#At the end of the service, my daughter and I were standing at the grave and someone from the parks department came over and said: #Do you mind leaving please because we need to get the grave filled.#Benefits office #treating me like a liar#, says Dundee cancer sufferer\" title\"#Benefits office #treating me like a liar#, says Dundee cancer sufferer# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph    benefits-office-treating-me-like-a-liar-says-dundee-cancer-sufferer embed # secretdLJuUpxbUH\" data-secret\"dLJuUpxbUH\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"#So before we even got in the car and drove away, the digger was there ready to fill the hole in.

More details of the competition and the prizes on offer at the bottom of this page.To be clear, features we#ll run on the contenders for Aberdeen#s Greatest Goal, followed by a closing poll to determine the winner, won#t necessarily focus on goals of signicance which have secured silverware or qualication, like John Hewitt#s header in Gothenburg or Darren Mackie#s finish in Dnipro.What we are talking about is goals of technical brilliance, made either inidually or as a team, some of which could be meaningless in terms of competitions and silverware.This pearler from left winger GMS in the fourth round of the Scottish Cup came when the Dons were already - up and cruising against the then-Championship Buddies. The strike also arrived so soon after the start of the second half, some of the ,-strong crowd inside Pittodrie weren#t back in their seats to witness it.However, none of that takes away from a strike which couldn#t have been hit cleaner, nor placed more perfectly into the far postage stamp # despite the fact Mackay-Steven was moving at pace towards the byeline.So good was this hit, it was declared the goal of the round, and this clip to mark the award shows the lasered shot from every glorious angle:After the Scottish Cup win, GMS said: “That was probably the best goal I have scored. I got in front of the defender and just hit it.“From the moment it left my foot I thought it had a chance and it was nice to see it go in the top corner.“It was an important goal as well because - is never a safe result. Going - up made it hard for St Mirren to come back.“That goal was very pleasing as I have not scored many like that.#Win a   Aberdeen kids kit and £ Smyths voucher in our Aberdeen#s Greatest Goal competition\" title\"#Win a   Aberdeen kids kit and £ Smyths voucher in our Aberdeen#s Greatest Goal competition# # Evening Express\" src\"https:www.eveningexpress fp sport football aberdeen-fc donsnews help-us-find-the-best-strike-ever-from-a-dandy-don embed # secretngfcQjpJ\" data-secret\"ngfcQjpJ\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"We want youngsters to have a go at imitating our Aberdeen#s Greatest Goal contenders, with the club agreeing to give away a kids# home kit and kids# away kit for the two best efforts as chosen by our  of judges.

By adding night-scented plants and soft lighting, along with pale-coloured flowers and foliage that appear to glow in the fading light, your garden will become an enticing ‘room’ to sit in at the end of the day.White flowering plants # like big blooms of hydrangeas # have a lovely glow in the evening garden reflecting the last of the light which makes them appear brighter than other plants.  Pale blues and lilacs also look their best in fading light, so sea holly with its tiny blue flowers that sit in rosettes of silvery-grey bracts is a great addition.Bright foliage also creates an evening glow in the garden. Light-coloured, iegated and silver leaf plants reflect any available light. Lambs Earis a popular ground cover plant that has the most wonderful soft, furry, silver-grey leaves.  It’s fairly drought resistant so a good choice for a dry, sunny border.Many beautul flowers only produce scent at night and often have a stronger aroma than their daytime counterparts.  Fragrance is released from night-scented flowers as the heat of the day lingers into the evening.  Petunias may seem be a strange choice for a night garden, but they are night scented. Some smell during the day, but not to the same intensity of the night scent. Night Scented Stocks do just that and have a pastel colour flower palate.It’s best to plant scented night garden flowers where you’ll brush against them or come close to them. Try planting them around doors and paths.  If you are planting in pots make sure you arrange them round seating areas to provide a heady aroma or position them near doors and windows so that the fragrance drts inside.Even though planting the right night-flowering plants in the right place will give you stunning effects,you want to really enjoy your garden after dark, some form of garden lighting is essential.  Try not to floodlight your entire garden. Instead, pick out specic plants and trees to showcase. Up lighting, either set on spikes or recessed into the ground, showcases plants beautully at night.But it’s not just at night time you want your garden to look good so here are some tips for this month from the Royal Horticultural Society."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor may 15 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,A big thank you to whoever has tidied up Ardrishaig Community Garden, mown the grass and repaired and painted the fences.Such a peaceful place to call into while out exercising.

They are doing the same to support other temporary NHS services across Scotland.Our people have worked around the clock with health boards across the country to offer new, technical solutions to help frontline health workers get on with their jobs during this crisis.Our frontline staff in contact centres across Scotland – including Aberdeen, Dundee, Glasgow and Greenock – have risen to this unprecedented challenge. We’ve received a huge surge of customers asking for faster connections to help with home working, home schooling and running their businesses remotely.These colleagues – most of whom can now work from home when they want to – have performed a critical role keeping our customers, including frontline health workers and vulnerable people, connected.The people in our two  contact centres in Scotland are also playing a critical role, answering lesaving emergency calls.I couldn’t be more proud of how my colleagues have responded to these challenges and their desire to help us all through this crisis.Jane Wood, BT Group director in Scotland, Edinburgh.COVID- is seriously not a jokeGlobally kills thousands of folkYou start coughing, you can#t breatheWithout a respirator, this earth you#ll leaveSocial distancing is now in placeKeep two metres apart, not face to faceWash your hands frequently and well hours on surfaces it can dwellShop infrequently, for essentials onlyDon#t mix with othersyou#re lonelyKeep in touch by text and phoneDon#t put yourself at risk, stay aloneIt#s hoped soon this contagion will peakThen we canto normal, so to speakDon#t travel to other towns by carIt can spread the virus near and farSports, socialising and most work on holdThe alternative could cause damage untoldSupport the NHS, essential workers and neighboursThen we#ll defeat this virus by all our laboursDugald MacGilp, Lochgilphead.Sir,We are looking for people who have the passion to bring communities together, believe in the power of co-operation and who hold the well-being of their community at the forefront of their mind.The successful #Member Pioneers# will receive full training and business support as they help groups and iniduals during the coronavirus pandemic and beyond.

Action is needed and the bullies must be confronted. That they were allowed to behave in this way for so long is the real shocker.Their own managers have questions to answer.

Mindfulness concentrates your mind on the ‘here and now’ and is a proven way of dealing with mild depression or anxiety.Focus on what the plants feel like – not just their fragrance when touched – from leathery and lacey to soft and smooth. You can also mix plants that are great to touch with tactile hard landscaping elements such as a water feature, smooth polished round pebbles or the glazed ceramics.Some top touching plants and features to considerLeaves # try Stachys byzantina, commonly known as Lamb#s Ear. Its soft, downy, furry silver-grey leaves are a favourite among gardeners who tend to use it for ground cover in rich soil. As a contrast there is Acuba japonicawhich has smooth, glossy leathery leaves.Flowers # who can resist touching a bottlebrush Callistemon cintrinus – bundles of tiny delicate stamen flowers form a brush that’s soft to touch – or the soft paper-thin petals of a poppy Papaver orientale.Grasses # run your hand over the arching, thread-like leaves of feathery Stipa tenuissima also known as Mexican feather grass or the more robust drought proof ornamental Festuca glauca with thread-like blue foliage that forms dense mounds.Bark – tree bark can also provide a tactile experience especially when it’s the stunning flowering cherry Prunus serrulate with mahogany coloured bark that peels away in bands round the trunk.Landscaping – you can easily y the textures in your garden by choosing dferent hard landscaping options. If you have smooth pebbles surrounding a water feature that you can run your hand over and through, you could place lichen-covered rocks in another area of the garden.Our general well-being is intrinsically linked to the natural world which is why Thrive – the gardening for health charity – has developed the Thrive Gardening Club.For fortnightly tips on getting the most out of your garden, whatever your age or ability, and information on how gardening can keep you healthy and feeling good visit www.thrive.org.uk get-involved keep-in-touch subscribe-to-gardening-clubThrive is the UK’s leading provider of social and therapeutic horticulture programmes using gardening to bring about positive changes in the lives of people living with disabilities, ill health or mental health issues, or who are isolated, disadvantaged or vulnerable."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor may 22 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,Mental Health Awareness Week, now in its th year, runs from May  to May .This year, the theme for the week is kindness and across the country, people will be celebrating kindness in digital and creative ways within social distancing restrictions.The last couple of months, with all the uncertainty of the virus and the impact of lockdown, have been an extremely stressful and worrying time for many people across the Highlands and Islands. People who may have previously felt isolated in remote and rural communities may be feeling this even more acutely at this time, so it’s important they know support is available.Across the region, many people have also sadly faced the pain of losing loved ones to the virus or have fallen ill themselves, while others have seen their livelihoods put at risk or incomes reduced. All of this has put additional strain on people’s mental well-being.This year’s Mental Health Awareness Week is putting the focus on kindness as a means of helping people through the pandemic and building a better society as we emerge from it. We see many acts of kindness in the Highlands and Islands all the time, but this week is an opportunity for people to reflect on their interactions with others and how they can try and be a little kinder during this unprecedented time.David Stewart, MSP for Highlands and Islands region.Sir,During Mental Health Awareness Week, sight loss charity RNIB Scotland is highlighting the emotional reassurance and practical help it is offering during the coronavirus lockdown.Our Need to Talk telephone counselling service remains available in Argyll and Bute for anyone diagnosed with sight loss, as well as their families, friends and carers.Losing some or even all your sight can be devastating news to take in, but our trained helpers can support you in coming to terms with your condition and finding the way forward.RNIB is concerned the lockdown might be affecting people who are blind and partially sighted, many of whom are older, particularly hard. The uncertainty over access to basic shopping and medication, to information in accessible formats, the social isolation and barriers to being guided because of social distancing can all add and compound to the mental and emotional stress people are experiencing.As well as our Need to Talk service, the RNIB helpline on    is available for anyone with sight loss and we continue to organise social activities over the phone and social media.We want people with sight loss to know they are not alone and that help is available.James Adams, RNIB Scotland director, Edinburgh.The Scottish Invasive Species Initiativehas launched Alien Detectives – a fun and educational online resource to help the young and not so young  learn more about alien # or non-native – invasive species.Originally designed as a school education pack, the huge array of activities now includes a wide range of fun games and activities that anyone can enjoy at home, in the garden or on local walks during lockdown.Alien Detectives includes crafts, quizzes, worksheets, presentations and puzzles all themed around invasive species and the river environment. Although primarily aimed at young people, anyone with an interest in the environment or invasive species can enjoy them too.Our project team has been busy while homeworking during lockdown to produce these fantastic resources. We hope becoming Alien Detectives will bring many hours of enjoyment to iniduals and families during lockdown, especially at a time when most young people are not in a regular school environment and might be looking for a new challenge or activities to continue their learning.Invasive non-native species might be a new topic to many but it is a really important one. Invasive species can have a major impact on our environment and native wildle and are responsible for signicant bioersity loss in Scotland and across the world. We hope these resources will help raise awareness of the impacts of invasive species and inspire more young people to learn something about them.No prior knowledge is needed and there’s lots to learn and have fun with so become an Alien Detective and help us tackle invasive species today.All of the ‘Alien Detectives’ resources can be found at www.invasivespecies.scot alien-detectives.Callum Sinclair, SISI Project Manager, Newton Stewart.Sir,We may not be able to hold picnics in the usual way just yet, but why not hold the next best thing – a virtual picnic  That way you can invite as many people as you want.National charity Family Action is running its Virtual Family Picnic from May  to May  and everyone is invited.

We stayed with Margaret and Iain McDonald at their home named Meadowview in Tarbert which was located near the school.We all enjoyed the area so much that we continued to visit every year for the next consecutive eight years.Margaret invited me to go out on the herring boats once or twice. One was named Village Maid and the other Village Belle and, needless to say, we often had kippers for breakfast, which were very nice. I remember there was a boat called the Southern Cross tied up to Cock Island # can anyone tell me any history of it and when it disappeared There also used to be a smokehouse for kippers along from Tarbert to Ardrishaig.Another fond memory I have is watching the logging trucks unloading on the quay and watching them get loaded on to large boats and I think then being shipped round to Sweden or Finland. Is that correct or not as I thought there was a paper mill at Fort William As mentioned earlier, I joined North West Ambulance Service in the s and Margaret used to send me the Argyllshire Advertiser and in one of them was an advert for recruitment to the Scottish Ambulance Service.I duly got an application form from Paisley and was all but sending the form in when I realised it would be very unfair to move so far away from our young children#s grandparents and for them to be unable to see them growing up. At the time your local pharmacist was retiring and my we Sue was a qualied pharmacist, but our children were both under school age so relied on her parents for child care. Ironically, I believe the job was filled with a Blackpool pharmacist whom I had met ocassionally.My love for Scotland continued, and we had our honeymoon travelling around Scotland and calling in at Tarbert for several days on the trip round.Our last trip up there was  in June as a treat from our daughter who accompanied us on this trip. The weather was glorious, and one day we caught the bus to Skipness and walked part of the Kintyre Way back.Another day we took the MacBrayne Ferry to Islay, which was again a glorious day out, also visited Crinan, Lochgilphead and Inveraray, followed by a couple of days fishing off the pier in Tarbert. We travelled back via Portavadie and Dunoon, and have in the past used the ferry to Arran, then Brodick, Ardrossan and home.Thank you for taking the time to read this.

But the COVID- lockdown interrupted proceedings.This season’s Scottish Cup was a bit of a disappointment with Star exiting the competition in the second round after losing out to a vastly improved Dumbarton United side -. On the plus side, the first round saw Star take on Paisley League team Pollok FC and an excellent performance saw Star run out convincing winners -, one of only four defeats suffered by Pollok in all competitions.In the West Region Cup, Star progressed to the quarter-final again. A first round bye, a convincing - win against Cambuslang FA then a walkover saw the Lochgilphead youths face Paisley League A Division team Erskine.In a hard-fought encounter, Star matched Erskine for most of the game but with only  players available they couldn’t get the breakthrough they needed and eventually lost -.Star started their league campaign in September with a competitive match against new team Thorn, who transferred from Paisley A Division. Star lost -.Two strong performances in October saw Star record  a terric - win over Shettleston, last season’s league runners up, and a - win against St Patrick’s Sports Academy # an entertaining but nerve-wracking game.A mid-season stutter in November saw the Lochgilphead boys lose out to Cathcart -, then Clydebank -, both newcomers.The losing run continued into early December as Star faced last season’s champions Drumchapel Amateurs ending up down - at half-time before recovering their form with a committed second half display to pull it back to -. Unfortunately they lost out to a fourth Drumchapel goal as they chased the winner themselves.This set Star back on track as they finished the year with a hugely convincing performance, demolishing Cathcart -.January and February proved a real battle with the weather with wind, rain and freezing temperatures # often all three # only allowing four games to take place. Star secured fine victories over Busby, -, and Glasgow Red Star, -, and fought back to grind out creditable draws with Shettleston, -, and Place Park, another new team, -.Star played one league game in March before lockdown and again it was another entertaining game with a rollercoaster feel to it. Facing up to Drumchapel Amateurs, both teams played out another terric match which had everything.Coming back from a goal down and with only  men, Star played cracking football to race into a - lead but it took its toll as Drumchapel stuck to their task to draw level before adding a couple more goals to secure a win in the final five minutes.This was another fine season for Red Star s, competing well in a strong league, with only  signed players.Though the season was cut short, the boys played  games winning , drawing two and losing seven. They scored  goals and conceded  goals. There were some cracking games and the boys were looking forward to the knock-out stages of the league cup.Inconsistency probably cost Star a few more wins, but that’s what youth football development is all about and there is potential for the boys to develop.Well done from coaches and parents to the  boys who played this season – Craig Aitken, Zak Barclay, Gregor Brown, Keiran Caskie, Lewis Curran, Ruaridh Green, Woody Hoad, Alexander McLean, Conner McMurchy, Leon Murphy, Innes Paterson, Jamie Stewart and Tom West.Thanks for great support goes to sponsors Ardrishaig Community Trust, main strip, SC Crawford Building Contractors Limited, change strip and zip tops, Jewsons, tracksuits, and Mid Argyll Youth Development Services and the parents, supporters, referees and opposition teams that have made the season so enjoyable."},{"url":null,"title":"sheena shows the way as tarbert tees off","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsGolf started again at Glenralloch as lockdown measures were eased slightly across Scotland.The first members were on the tee at am on Friday May  for the re-opening, followed by a steady stream as the day went on.

This is achieved by installing a large cylindrical passageway in the centre of a cage, from which tarpaulin hangs and protects salmon from lice infestations when they swim to the surface to fill their swim-bladders.At Port na Cro, the tarpaulin hangs to a m depth and the feeders are placed at m.Gareth Siney, farm manager at Port na Cro, said: #At the moment, we use lots of dferent tools to tackle sea lice such as water pressure and using cleaner fish that naturally pick the sea lice off our salmon.

council warned that the launch of a new vision for the area three years after the local authority produced its Cockenzie Masterplan document ndash which it has never adopted ndash would leave the public with no confidence in the planning system.East Lothian Council paid consultants to produce the Cockenzie Masterplan for the former Cockenzie Power Station site, which it owns, after a series of

Hotels require one space per room.I understand that the parking standards have only recently come into effect and all other licensed premises have the benefit of being historical licensed premises and therefore protected. However, I fully believe that a common sense approach should have been taken in this instance, particularly as I submitted a very detailed travel plan which included not only promoting nearby parking options, bus timetables and taxis but actually incentivised travel to and from The Catrsquos Pyjamas by bus, taxi or on foot. When coming up with the concept of The Catrsquos Pyjamas in late summer early autumn  the first thing I did, being a total novice to owning a bar, was to engage with the licensing department.The licensing standards officer advised me I could operate with occasional licences whilst working toward the full premises licence so after submitting the occasional licence applications I was surprised to be told by planning I needed to submit a change of use application for the occasional licences.Bewildered by the conflicting information but just wishing to do what was required, I immediately submitted the application and paid the associated fee.It is frustrating that I was erroneously informed that a change of use was required for occasional licences which stopped me operating and establishing precedent.It is also frustrating I find myself in this situation because I accepted the advice and guidance of East Lothian Council. I am not seeking to apportion all the blame on the council as I have made mistakes, the biggest of which is being naive enough to believe that those who should have and give you the correct information actually do have and give you the correct information. What we have created at The Catrsquos Pyjamas is truly special. Those who have enjoyed an evening with us will validate that.I have had such incredible support from people across Dunbar and beyond that it continues to blow my mind. There is a real desire for The Catrsquos Pyjamas to work and given the chance it could become something truly amazing which is beneficial not only to the town but the county. But this journey has been very painful and costly.There has been a clear campaign against The Catrsquos Pyjamas to the point of it being a vendetta.Objectors have ly contacted the police to report noise when there was none ndash veried by Police Scotland ndash just to get it on the record ahead of the licensing board hearing. I need to take time to reflect on everything that has happened, to reflect on the impact that it has had on myself and my family. I need to investigate whether another location would be better orthe business model should change.At the moment all I can say is sincere thank you to everyone who has supported this venture from the outset and especially to my family for all the blood, sweat, tears and cash they have put into creating this very special place.Ross Hardie,The Catrsquos Pyjamas,Belhaven,Dunbar"},{"url":null,"title":"kids-create-chain-key-workers-tesco-superstore","story":"They were asked to create a window display for the store by its community champion, Jane Shepherd, and were rewarded with some treats.The hub, based at Pinkie St Peterrsquos Primary School, provides learning and childcare.

In theory at least. The worry is that,the grim weekly supermarket trip offers any guide, the new normal might feel almost as disturbing as our current lockdown.

And yet, unless there is a surge back to our old ways, the economy will slide even further into the abyss. Itrsquos hard not to feel a moral obligation to help businesses get back on their feet.Some weeks ago, I contemplated what I was most looking forward to doing when we emerged from purdah. Apart from meeting family and friends, top of the list was going for a coffee, closely followed by a day in the library. If to this could be added an early evening drink in the pub, possibly planning our next trip to Italy, I would ask nothing more. What a thrilling lestyle, you must be thinking. Yet Irsquom probably not alone, during these eerily frozen weeks, in realising how narrow and predictable the margins of my le are, and happily so.They say it takes six weeks to form a habit, so perhaps we will get used to the protocols protecting us when we enter the classroom, or train, or go shopping for clothes. It might become second nature to dine behind plastic screens on the bistro table, or to stay three steps away from our nearest and dearest, even in their own homes. And in one respect at least Irsquom looking forward to making my own mask. In winter I resemble a figure in a John Bellany painting, my nose ice cold and red raw. A fleecy face-covering could save on central heating.Even as the danger of infection diminishes, the sobering reality is that fear will persist for a considerable time. To expect to gather in a cafe as we used to, drawing up chairs to crowd around a table, is to day-dream. Almost nothing will be the same as in the good old days, or at least not at first. In the months ahead we will either have to accustom ourselves to new and uncomfortable regulations and rules, or stay housebound.Therersquos little doubt, though, that seeing the ties that bind us being slowly slackened is a huge psychological boost.

Yet the mere fact of being banned from travelling more than five miles from home is what has felt so constricting in recent times, even , like me, yoursquore usually quite happy staying within easy walking distance of your door.As we go through the gradual phases of our staggered release, like a barge inching through a lock, simply knowing that we can go wherever we like will come as a tremendous relief. Who careswe must be home by bedtime  Just glimpsing somewhere dferent will be excitement enough. It marks the restoration of a basic human liberty. And, as our leash ens, so spirits will lt. The invisible cordon sanitaire that has been restraining us in will vanish, and to a large degree our lives will feel like our own again.Yet while we yearn to get back to our old haunts, elements of the crisis have shown a better way, which hopefully will endure. The rise in walking and cycling signals a serious cultural sht. Along with the upturn in home deliveries, it might indicate the beginning of the end for the car. Even where I live, in the country, the air is cleaner, the roads emptier, the birds louder. The outpouring of care and concern shown across the nation for neighbours and those in need has strengthened peoplersquos connection to their community. More of us have been shopping or ordering locally, and discovering whatrsquos on our doorstep. Some have been baking their own bread, or cooking from scratch, and discovering the humdrum but satisfying joys of home le. Looking to the uncertain future, a few are on their way to becoming self-sufficient.As we gradually emerge into a freer existence, carrying hand sanitisers the way Clint Eastwood holstered a Colt , one thing seems certain. We wonrsquot take anything for granted again. The simplest of activities have already assumed a profound signicance. To call something ordinary or normal will soon be the highest terms of praise.

I donrsquot want to give the ending away too early but somewhere around pm my family will be saying, quite genuinely, as we sit back from a table strewn with the smash and grab of dishes well tackled that this has been the best lockdown meal we have ever had. By far. And wersquove had a few.Were they kebabs  Yeah, but very proper ones. Farruj msahab first though. A golden crisp and boned and actually whole baby chickenlemony, seasoned with herbs, flakes of oregano still visible, crackling magnicently apart to be be piled on plates with that sumptuous butter rice.Spinach lamb, randomly ordered, now looked at in surprise but the meat carmelised and all fully loaded with the flavours of garlic and coriander and somehow still succulent and juicy. Hummus beiruti with fresh parsley and oil and beans, then very good falafel too that we all e into dipping and crunching and commenting upon.Therersquos a tub with a creamy, chilli-ish paprika-ish dressing, a full dish of smoked aubergine baba-ghanouj, another full serving of a vibrantly green and crunchy fattoush toasted bread chunks in the salad and pomegranate. Lots more. Sticks of those little purple salty savoury Lebanese pickles, onions seasoned and dusted with herbs, a full mixed grill I didnrsquot even, ahem, realise I had ordered. And hunks of succulent lamb mashawi, genuinely properly marinated and therefore moist and herby seared chicken chunks from the grill a chicken shawarma that somehow manages to have the faint fragrance of cinnamon and even a hint of nutmeg. And all of it accompanied by those large, thin, puffy Lebanese breads.We finish off with slices of cool fresh fruit. Just apple and orange ndash but simple and refreshing.Why was this so good  At one stage we were eating chicken from the charcoal grill prepared in three dferent ways. Because every single thing had an inidual flavour and was, somehow, by someone, prepared with care.How much did I pay for all this  Well, I thought I was ordering the set meze those mixed hot and cold mezze for pound and expecting tabbouleh, labneh, kabees, those punchy Armenian sausages, the fabulous little borak pastries I have had before. But when the dust settled I realise I had ordered instead the set menu at pound. Oops. Plus some other dishes. Hey, doesnrsquot matter. Worth every penny.Beirut Star Paisley Rd WestGlasgow G PX  www.beirutstarglasgowMenu: Proper stand-up Lebanese restaurant with a deep, wide charcoal grill and a serious commitment to preparing all those fabulous meze with full-fat flavourPrice: Charcoal grill dishes hover around the pound mark, meze much cheaper, though a special occasion demanded a pound set menu.Food: A charcoal grill that is used with skill and care meaning moist, seasoned and full flavoured whole baby chicken juicy, caramelised lamb.

Irsquom going to continue to focus on coronavirus for as long as I need to. That is my total focus right now, she said.And understandably so.This weekrsquos independence debate was prompted by a Panelbase poll for the Scot Goes Pop website.It askedthe SNP and Greens should ldquoconsider including an outright promise of independence in their manestos for a future election, to give people an opportunity to vote for or against the ideaBoris Johnson blocked a referendum.The answers came back  per cent Yes, % No and % Donrsquot Know.:Latest poll predicts SNP set for huge win at  Scottish electionsCue the SNPrsquos leading advocates of a Plan B on independence, Inverclyde Councillor Chris McEleny and MP Angus Brendan MacNeil, demanding their idea be put on the SNP conference agenda.In the absence of Westminster granting Holyrood the power to hold Indyref, or a court saying Holyrood already has it, the manesto for the  Holyrood election ldquoshall state that the election of a pro-independence majority of seats shall be a mandate from the people of Scotland to commence independence negotiations with the UK Government.This idea of making an election victory the basis for independence, rather than a referendum that never comes, was backed by % of those who voted SNP at last yearrsquos election.As always, Mr McEleny and Mr MacNeil have a point. If the UK government wonrsquot grant a referendum, the SNP needs to think creatively. But they do not have a case.Apart from the usual objections - other countries wonrsquot recognise anything short of a referendum, and the UK canrsquot be forced to open negotiations - there is also the small matter of the world around us.The UK economy shrank by % in March and April - three times the fall felt in the entire   Crash.As Andrew Wilson, author of the SNPrsquos Growth Commission, said yesterday, we have ldquolost two decades of improvement and growth and that is desperate for living standards.Mr Wilson also warned Scotland faces a bleaker recession than the rest of the UK because of its highly exposed tourism and hospitality sector and longer lockdown.His comment that in Scotland ldquomany businesses have remained closed for longer than necessary at potentially fatal cost to both employer and employees generated awkward headlines for Ms Sturgeon.But there was also another, subtler line tucked away in his analysis.Rebuilding the economy will ldquorequire partisanship to be shelved in the national interest, he said.As the constitutional debate brings out partisanship like little , the implication is clear.The next Holyrood election will be the strangest yet.

Jumpy impatience is never becoming, especially when combined with hazy nostrums about what comes afterwards.For there can be noto Plan A, far less an advance to a Plan B, without trying to answer the huge economic and social problems being generated at speed by the pandemic.That hellish hard work may lack the quick gratication of a process wheeze, but it has to be done before electors will consider whether independence is the next best step.What the SNPrsquos excitables need first and foremost is a Prospectus B to make the case when the time is right.But that, like our rubble economy, will take years to rebuild."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/11475603.jpg?type=article-full","title":"pilot-whales-stranded-shore-scottish-island","story":"The whales were part of a -string pod and were found off the coast ofLochboisdale in South Uist, Outer Hebrides on Thursday night.However, on Friday several were foundstranded and in distress on the shoreline ndash with the other pilot whales in deeper water nearby.:Robert the Bruce statue vandalised with graffiti claiming he was a racist kingLocals raised the alarm and rescue charity British Divers Marine Le Rescuecalled for boats in the area to steer clear of the rest of the creatures off the coast.Thanks to the efforts of the islanders, eight of the pilot whales were successfully refloated out to sea.

There is a real danger that,the process of reopening areas of the economy is botched, the long-term impact of the restrictions could prove as damaging as the disease itself.It is welcome, then, that the Scottish Government should have announced its provisional intent to lt restrictions on aspects of the tourist industry from July , as long as progress has been made to phase three of the route map for exit. It is not only a crucial part of our economy, but tourism and other industries which augment or are a component of it, including the transport, hospitality, sport and cultural sectors, are those that have suffered the harshest effects during the period of containment.It is cheering, too, that a move to phase two begins next week and, of course, that the death toll and rates of infection outside hospitals and care homes have fallen signicantly.There remain, however, major doubts about the handling and timetable of both the UK and Scottish Governments in moving towards lockdown in the pandemicrsquos early stages the grim toll in Scottish care homes, which has been characterised as the greatest disaster of the devolution era, must be counted as an abject failure of government. The likelihood that the UK may be already one of the worst,not the worst, affected countries in both fatalities and economic impact, ought to be a warning of the terrible dangers of mishandling the moves towards recovery.The considerable problems not yet resolved in testing are further grounds for caution. Yet an overzealous interpretation of the precautionary principle, or delay for the sake of token dference, may end up causing irreparable damage to peoplersquos jobs, livelihoods and personal lives.No one expects that things willto anything like normality soon. Firms and employers have already made huge changes to the way they expect to work, but there are numerous areas where government needs to balance risk and pragmatic action. Many employees will find it dficult toto work until schooling resumes. Social distancing requirements for workplaces will have a major impact on manufacturing productivity. The proposed UK quarantine rules obviously curtail foreign visitor numbers, and evenmany Britons choose to holiday at home, there will be transport dficulties for coaches, trains and ferries.Above all, without a serious examination of the guidance on the two-metre limit on public distancing, itrsquos dficult to see how many pubs, restaurants and small retail outlets can be commercially viable.

This is merely a rather more visceral rendition of what governments and universities do routinely when they remove degrees and honours from figures who fall from grace. Viewed purely from an artistic perspective many of these old statues are of limited aesthetic value anyway and Irsquod be inclined to remove most of them on those grounds and replace them with something more vivid and edgy that honours the nobility of lesser realms. Stick the old slave-owners in a museum and let their mass defenestration be regarded as a moment in history of itself.What is more important here, I think is this historic opportunity of pulling down the much more insidious and less visible structures which permit racism and racial discrimination to flourish in the long term. I was moved by Anas Sarwarrsquos speech on Thursday at Holyrood in which he starkly outlined our casual indference to racial inequality in civic Scotland.Purely in the political realm I have been disobliging of Mr Sarwarrsquos machinations and stratagems in seeking to shape the Labour Party in Scotland. But there was no doubting his passion on this occasion as he took us through the myriad executive positions in Scotland by which civic influence is wielded and told us they were the exclusive preserve of whites. Scotland and Glasgow in particular is home to a prominent, well-educated Asian community who have contributed greatly to the economy and culture of our nation ndash Mr Sarwar himself is a gted son of this group.Yet, in  smart, erse and inclusive Scotland doesnrsquot trust any of them to be major decision-makers in the civic boardroom cliques which determine future strategies in education, health and the arts.

The figure of poundm emerged but it admitted that this was probably incomplete, so sinewy and deep-rooted were the routes and means of profiteering from slavery. Itrsquos inconceivable that other Scottish academic institutions, venerable trades houses, finance firms and family fortunes have not similarly benefited from the routine torture, rape and murder of millions of black people.Nor was this confined to the actions of a few old merchants whose stone effigies are currently looking a bit precarious. In a book of essays published in  called Recovering Scotlandrsquos Slavery Past, Professor Sir Tom Devine and a group of his fellow academics outlined the extent to which almost the entire economy of Scotland in the th and th centuries was under-written by profits from the Caribbean slave markets.:Black Lives Matter: Every Scottish street linked to slave-trade revealedIn his concluding essay, Sir Tom wrote: ldquoThe funds which helped to lubricate the Chesapeake trade were drawn from Scottish landowners, trustees, tradesmen, physicians, military officers, spinsters, widows and university professors, among many others. That also meant the profits of the slave-trade tobacco business were widely distributed through these financial networks well beyond the ranks of the active merchant community itself.Perhaps itrsquos reasonable to question how far back we need to go and whether the raking of ancient ashes can achieve anything. Yet, no-one is proposing punitive land and property-grabs or to impoverish those whose present fortunes are directly descended from racist genocide. Itrsquos surely also reasonable to encourage these families, firms and trades bodies to make a similar audit of their slavery-derived fortunes. Like Glasgow University they could make proportionate reparation with endowments and scholarships for the descendants of those whose suffering once fed and watered the entire Scottish nation.When the Labour Party began to introduce all-women, constituency short-lists they were criticised for endorsing the sort of discrimination they purported to revile. Yet, such a response failed to acknowledge that centuries of male privilege saw many men being promoted and honoured merely by their membership of exclusively all-male golf clubs and masonic lodges.

If he does so, he will see repeated arguments from the Scottish Government and its advisors that lockdown was not necessary. As late as March , we were told very clearly that \"we are definitely not at the stage of needing lockdown measures in Scotland\". Not by Boris Johnson, not by Dominic Cummings, but by the Chief Medical Officer for Scotland under the admiring eye of Nicola Sturgeon.In the case of quarantine, we need to see footage of the First Minister or the Health Secretary advocating such a move at any stage. Or perhaps correspondence to the Home Secretary or Health Secretary to show how much more prescient the Scottish Government was. In the absence of quarantine, it was all the time within the devolved public health powers of the Scottish Government to test international arrivals at Scotlands airports and advise them to go into quarantinethey tested positive. Or to set up a strict Scotland-only protocol for everyone entering the country by whatever means. These steps were not taken, and again, the people deciding not to do so were not bogeymen in London but the Scottish Government.The buck stops in Edinburgh and no-one should forget it.Peter A Russell, Glasgow G.GEORGE Dalestates that \"Nicola Sturgeons Government has been giving out coronavirus guidance in a very casual manner\" nothing could be further from the truth. At the very start of this crisis, Ms Sturgeon made it clear that she would address and treat the population as grown-ups who would behave responsibly, and the vast majority of people have repaid her trust. However, although there is reason to be optimistic that the worst of the pandemic is over, for now, it would be a fatal mistake to assume that our lives can quickly go back to normal complacency could easily allow Covid to flourish again.I strongly disagree with Michael Gallagher when he writes that \"compelling vulnerable people to self-isolate for a further seven weeks is a truly appalling measure\". My daughter is in the shielded group as she is undergoing chemotherapy, so I fully understand how very dficult and distressing it is for everyone in that group and for their families. But I am also extremely relieved that the First Minister is continuing to shield these very vulnerable people to do otherwise could have truly appalling and unbearable consequences.Ruth Marr, Stirling.THERE is much to admire about Nicola Sturgeons energy with delivering her daily bulletins updates to the nation, but I have to ask: is she starting to dither with less coherence in her message I have to confess to harbouring a vested interest in this matter, but I dont get the rationale about the dates we may be able to start self-catering vacations in Scotland. A July  start to holidaying in Scotland was originally pencilled in. It appears, in England, the earliest date is Saturday July , yet, in Scotland, it has now slipped to Wednesday July . Why a Wednesday when most rentals and breaks in Scotland run from Saturday to Saturday  Why not Saturday July   I understand our R rating is more positive now, and July is the peak of the Scottish holiday season. There would be great economic benefits in starting up on July and easing the huge dficulties facing our important tourism industry.I do have a week booked in Argyllshire from Saturday July  so I hold my hands up about my self-interest. It would allow a family holiday with our six-month-old granddaughter, whom my we and I along with other family members have never been able to cuddle and bond with due to our adherence to the spirit of lockdown. I could understand and acceptthe date is July  for good reason, but a midweek date is illogical and not an example of a joined up plan.What are the reasons for the change or was the script just a trle muddled  Can someone please explain Keith Smith, Edinburgh EH.IN , Scottish residents spent some  million nights overseas while overseas visitors spent some . million nights in Scotland .If quarantine restrictions continue for the foreseeable future, thus preventing virtually all international travel in and out of Scotland, and everyone in Scotland still spends the same number of nights away from home, our tourist industry is going to have to gear up to cope with the incredible demand for the equivalent of an extra . million nights per year .Perhaps our accommodation providers should stop moaning and start rolling up their sleeves to prepare for when and where the action really starts.Quite apart from providing a massive boost to the economy throughout the Scottish tourist areas, there is also the warm feeling that those airlines which so recklessly and illegally brought thousands of cases of Covid- into the UK with such tragic and disastrous consequences, are going to continue to suffer their self-inflicted bloody noses for some considerable time to come.Quarantine Rules OK.Andrew S Noble, Dunoon.MERELY requesting people to wear masks while shopping is not enough. Given the choice, most people will opt for the more comfortable option and refrain from covering their faces.I wear a mask while shopping out of consideration to the shop staff who, after all, are turning out to work during a global pandemic in order to allow the public to access essential supplies.

Unsurprisingly, as time passes so businesses from across the region are increasingly seeking clarity on a wide range of issues vital to their survival.With Phase  of the unlocking process due shortly, the FSB believes that this is the perfect time for smaller businesses to question Mr Ewing on what the Scottish Government is doing to support businesses over the next year.The FSB’s Highlands  Islands Area Leader and director of the Kylesku Hotel, Tanja Lister, said: “We know how anxious businesses are becoming about their abilities to survive in this new world and, given that the virus is unpredictable, they clearly want as much clarity as possible so that they can plan their survival strategies once unlocking takes place.“In particular, they want to know when and how unlocking will take place, what they must do to comply with distancing protocols, how local communities will be persuaded that the time is right to unlock, and the nature of the Government-backed business support that will be put in place to carry the regional economy though to next Easter and beyond.“Nobody should think that businesses can go from nought to  in a few days – it will take a long time for them to recover, and many will need ongoing support from governments, public agencies, other businesses and, very importantly, the general public, for many months to come.“We know how heavily engaged Mr Ewing is in his vital role and we are delighted that he is giving up his time to take questions on Monday. This is the perfect time for him to meet Highlands  Islands businesses and we are looking forward to a very productive hour with him.”Questions must be submitted in advance and we will ask as many as we can in the allotted time, say the organisers. Participants can also submit comments during the meeting using Zoom’s ‘Chat’ .The event is free and open to all businesses.

Hundreds were accused after the Horizon system showed cash shortfalls at their branches.Speaking in the House, Mr Carmichael said: “I hope that when he s to the department today he will tell his officials and tell also the Post Office senior management that this review just isn’t going to cut it.#This is a complex case and that is why it requires a judge-led inquiry, and that is what will happen eventually, so why not just cut to the quick and do it now ”Responding for the Government, Paul Scully MP said: “The point is the terms of reference within this review are the same as a judge-led inquiry.#I do not want an inquiry that lasts  years and that sub-postmasters are going to come back time and time again with no justice. This is something that I have been pushing on from the moment that I found out the detail about it, and that is why I am going to drive this through to make sure that the answers are heard and that independent chair gets to the bottom of this and gets some answers.”Reacting after the exchange, Mr Carmichael said: “The minister’s response was inadequate. Postmasters are vital parts of our communities, especially in the outer isles where they sit at the heart of island le. This scandal and the Post Office’s woeful reaction to it have undermined confidence in the treatment of our postmasters. The government must do more to repair that trust, starting with a proper judicial inquiry.“It bears repeating that local post offices have proven their essential role once again during the Covid- crisis.

These figures do not account for tests undertaken through the UK Government testing system.Mr McArthur who, alongside the local press, has repeatedly appealed for this information to be released, was pleased that figures had finally been made public.He said: “I welcome the decision by NHS Orkney to publish localised information and provide the public with greater clarity on the level of testing taking place in Orkney.“I have been pressing Ministers for weeks to agree to releasing testing data.  To date, despite warm words, the Scottish Government has refused to budge.“I therefore welcome NHS Orkney’s decision to follow the lead taken by NHS Shetland in making public this information.  As we move forward with ‘test and protect’, other types of information will also be needed to give people an understanding of the situation in their local area.“It is clear that transparency is key to building public confidence and the compliance we will need to see as we continue to emerge from lockdown. This move by NHS Orkney is a good step in the right direction.”NHS Orkney has sought to remind the community that testing is available for anyone over the age of five who has symptoms, and to keep up hygiene standards in order to prevent the spread of the virus.Mr O#Brien said: “It is down to the great work and commitment from all those who live and work in Orkney that we have kept positive results so low, but we must not get complacent.#As the lockdown is being relaxed and people begin moving around more freely, we will be exposed again.“To keep safe, our community must continue to stick to the hygiene and infection control guidelines.”These include:copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It looks increasingly likely that any exit from lockdown and safe re-opening of tourism and hospitality businesses could be during the low season.#Without financial support to tide them over, that could be the nail in the coffin for many businesses.“In Shetland, like where in Scotland, earnings from tourism during the spring and summer months sustains people through the winter and it is a real worry that coronavirus hit just when the visitor season was starting.#It is clear that a -month plan, at least, is needed to ensure that viable businesses can survive to provide a living for their owners and be ready to safely welcome visitors again when the time is right.”Speaking via video link earlier this week, Mr Carmichael welcomed the Chancellor of the Exchequer#s announced extension to the furlough scheme to protect jobs – but added more was needed to help tourism.“Here in the Northern Isles we particularly see that in the visitor economy, which is crucial to us,# he added.#The assistance for bed and breakfast operators, or operators of self-catering accommodation, leaves too many people without the assistance they need.“A support scheme that finishes at the end of August, or September or whenever it will be, simply will not be adequate in parts of the country such as ours.#Those parts of the country that have seasonal tourism require a -month programme, or  the tourism industry that will be left to be resurrected at the end of this process will be that much weaker, and the rebuilding and recovery that much more dficult.” on Wednesday also heard from struggling tourism businesses.One BB owner said she had been unable to apply for support funds as they required applicants to have paid businesses rates, whereas she paid domestic council tax.Living Lerwick has also raised the plight of small tourism operators.Project manager Emma Miller said that as some did not have a business banking account they had been unable to apply for the Creative or Tourism and Hospitality Enterprises Fund, which opened in Scotland to support the industry. raquo"},{"url":null,"title":"more vessels but aprils gross tonnage is well down on last year ","story":"Lerwick Harbour saw a big reduction in shipping tonnage during April compared with the same month last year – although the number of arrivals was actually up slightly.A total of  vessels called, compared with  in April , but the overall tonnage dropped from , to ,grt.The deficit was partly due to no cruise ships callinglast year, although ferries, live fish carriers and oil traffic were all also down considerably.The April arrivals this year included  fishing boats,  workboats tenders,  ro ro ferries,  live fish carriers, eight oil boats, eight tugs, five tankers, five ferries and three pilot boats.The fishing vessels comprised  Shetland,  British, three Danish, two French and one Norwegian boat.For the first four months of the year the overall number of arrivals at Lerwick holds up reasonably well with  – , as compared to , in .

Many protesters’ actions, in clear breach of social distancing rules, were dangerous.Yet nobody should shed tears when the bronze statue of a brutal th century Bristol slaver is hauled from his distinguished plinth in the city centre and thrown into the harbour.Our main concern should be how and why it was allowed to stay there for so long.As Edward Colston#s effigy toppled towards the watery grave to which he had consigned so many enslaved Africans, a protestor knelt on Colston#s neck.That was a graphic illustration of the incident which precipitated the storm: the throttling by a Minneapolis police officer of the US citizen George Floyd.George Floyd#s last words were #I can#t breathe#, which applied both literally and to his place in society.There is nothing sacrosanct about most secular statues. Before  statues of Adolf Hitler were commonplace in Europe.You would be hard pressed to find one now.The same applies to Josef Stalin in most of the former Soviet territories.Just outside New Delhi there is a lonely and extensive graveyard of hundreds of statues of former eminences of the British colonial Raj. Wild dogs roam among them.Closer to home, Glasgow#s and Edinburgh#s exploitation of slavery is being recognised by the alteration of Glasgow street names and a plaque in Edinburgh#s St Andrew#s Square by the -foot statue of Henry Dundas, which will detail his connections with the slave trade.It#s either that or throw him in the Forth.We were no innocents in this field. In , no fewer than  per cent of Jamaican slave plantations were owned by Scots.Research by University College London has revealed that when slavery in British territory was abolished in , the equivalent of £ billon in compensation was handed out to just over  Scottish proprietors.They were not all in Glasgow and Edinburgh.Donald Martin of Monkstadt in Skye cashed in on his ill-gotten gains. So did Alexander MacLean of North Uist.The Raasay proprietor George Rainy banked his share from human traffic, as did Donald MacLeod of Lewis and Alexander McBarnet of Attadale.There are no statues of those gentlemen to throw in the sea.But the next time somebody suggests a similar fate for the statue of the Duke of Sutherland on Ben Bhraggie # a fate to which we would have little objection # we should remember that black lives also matter.They did then and they do now.The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until st May .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/HWRC__Portree_Re_Opening_15th_June_graphic-scaled.jpg","title":"portree recycling centre to re open on","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoineand receive confirmation before travelling to the site.The Portree site is open for essential waste disposal only, and householders are advised that journeys to a HWRC must only be undertakentheir waste cannot be stored at home safely.

Any vigilantism must be directed at ourselves and the messages we put out when we go about our day to day business as lockdown eases.Protect ourselves and others.Those vulnerable people we have been looking after with prescription runs and message collections, some of them might not be looking forward to an influx of staycationers.What  are they bringing with their much-needed cash None of these problems are insurmountable. Guidelines will be available and in the month ahead, confidence will hopefullyand a dose of common sense will go a long way to making things work.The talk is that furlough is just the precursor to redundancy, and the economy will be struggling in all sectors.The knock on is likely to be fewer visitors with less money, and of course with the quarantine enforcement for overseas visitors, there won’t be many coming from afar.I hope the tourismwill be a trickle, then a stream, in order for us all to get used to how it can work.Despite being involved in the business I actually hope that it never s to the flood, the tsunami of the last two years, where the danger was the destruction of our environment and our community.We were perhaps too busy making money to spend time with our families, friends and neighbours.While loving the quiet roads, the time spent with family, and the time spent re-evaluating prioritiesit couldn’t last for ever.The savings are being eaten into, the government assistance also doesn’t last forever, reality looms.There is an economic model of price and product determination, that everybody is acutely aware of called “supply and demand’.In recent years as the visitor numbers went through the roof, and perhaps became unsustainable, bed provision rose, spare rooms developed, cabins and pods built, garages renovated.Still numbers rose, and so did the prices, a simple correlation.There is likely to now be an oversupply of bed provision, the economists would foresee a reduction in price as people compete for a smaller market.This may at first bring prices down to a realistic level, there was perhaps a danger that Skye was becoming a rich person’s destination.A possible consequence may be what I have heard described as “a race to the bottom”, with what is effectively a price war, and possibly falling too far.This when the product suddenly has become more expensive to manage, rooms costing more to clean, hotels only being able to cope with fewer guests to comply with social distancing.We have a free market economy, there is little or no control, people can charge what they like, and undercutting is a valid entrepreneurial technique do something better cheaper#!I mentioned weeks ago, for many, the tourist dollar is the icing on the pension cake, a second income to a professional wage.Perhaps there is a fine line between need and greed.Some tourist operators have been forced to use food banks and needing help from the Skye Community Response group during lockdown.As business s, and these people can begin rebuilding their livelihoods, perhaps others have to decide what their own needs are.The pension or the wage might be enough.One of the reasons I love starlings is the incredible murmurations they create in autumn, just before roosting in the evenings.These bickering birds who flutter and jostle around the trees, for twenty minutes or so before descending to reeds and branch to sleep, put on a display with no equal in nature.Moving in unison, they create patterns in the sky, shapes, forms, dance. Apparently, each bird affects the six or seven around it but a flock of tens of thousands moves asone, producing something beautul.Community can be like that.The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until st May .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3168438.jpg--.jpg?1591781511000\n","title":"local translink staff in grocery donation drive","story":" Translink staff in Ballymena Bus and Rail Station have responded to the COVID- emergency by starting a special grocery donation drive for people in need in their local community.

Meter readers will be able to take readings from meters located in outside positions as normal.NIE Networks is urging customers to protect its meter readers and themselves by continuing to observe social distancing protocols. Ben Cupples, Meter Reading Manager at NIE Networks, explained the importance of recording a precise meter reading for the customer.“Providing a precise meter reading will ensure that your electricity bills accurately reflect your consumption,” he said. “Our meter readers will call to your home and will record the reading you provide while we wait.“If you are unable to read your meter for any reason oryou are not at home when we call, we will leave a card with information on how to submit your meter reading online via the NIE Networks website, via email or over the phone.”Mr Cupples explained that while meter reading activity would resume it would only be carried out with the health and safety of the public and meter readers in mind.“The safety of our employees and customers is our utmost priority. “If you see our meter readers out and about, we would ask that you please help them by standing at least two metres away. Likewise, we will stand at least two metres from customers’ doors at all times.“We are continually reviewing how we undertake our meter reading activities in light of COVID- and we are looking forward to being able to resume our normal way of working with customers at some stage, but we will only make that decision when it’s safe to do so.” NIE Networks is reminding customers that you only need to submit your reading to either NIE Networks or your supplier – there is no need to do it twice. Customers unable to submit a meter reading will receive an estimated bill from their supplier based on their usage history.If a member of the NIE Networks team arrives at the door, they will always show identication.

Less than half of childminders have stayed open in lockdown, and only for families on the original list of key workers.But that#s begun to change this past week, Ms Lewsley Mooney said.She added: We#re at a more positive position than we have been before.I think the Department of Education and the Executive realised that childcare is a linchpin to any process moving forward.In May she told Stormont#s education committee childminders had been brought to their knees by Covid-.Now about  people have registered their interest to become childminders, which she said was promising for a sector hit hard by the pandemic.But families are still calling on Stormont for clarity as more parentsto work.This week more than  people, including SDLP MP Claire Hanna, signed an open letter to the Health and Education Ministers for a roadmap for the sector reopening, and a long-term childcare strategy.Ulster University#s Ciara Fitzpatrick, who drafted the letter along with FactCheck NI founder Orna Young, said some families felt they had no choice but to send their children to grandparents or people who are shielding.She said there also needed to be more information on what the Executive#s new bubble policy meant for childcare, adding: I think parents feel like they have been forgotten about and they haven#t had the space to actually discuss how challenging the current situation has been for them.A spokeswoman for the Department of Health said childcare would be key in future -to-work decisions.She said the number of providers operating was expected to increase with demand. She added: Childcare providers are available to support workers who have been required to go to work to support the response to the Covid- pandemic or who have been permitted toto work by the NI Executive.From June  childminders have been able to extend their care from two families to three at one time.

The Volunteer Bikers Groupbegan with just five riders and now has  members who travel all over distributing food parcels, medication and personal protective equipment . Deliveries have included essential chemotherapy drugs for a patient in Donegal, who needed an urgent delivery from Altnagelvin Hospital. There have been some unusual requests too, with one volunteer tasked to deliver a Moses basket arriving to find the mother-to-be already in labour. The group is self-funding, with volunteers using their own motorbikes and fuel, but it does accept donations and to date has raised almost £, for the Northern Ireland Children#s Hospice. To recognise their efforts, representatives were invited to Stormont on Thursday, where they were thanked personally by Health Minister Robin Swann. Among them was their youngest PPE maker, -year-old Jamie Watson from Stranocum in Co Antrim, who has made over  frames for face shields. The five men who started the group are father and son Paul and Phil Johnston, John Lawson, Michael Price and Richard Webber. However, what began as a few trips to help elderly and vulnerable people needing prescriptions and essential items in the north Down area has mushroomed into an impressive assistance operation with volunteers from every corner of Northern Ireland. Every motorbike club in the province is involved and the volunteer riders include men and women from all walks of le - from helicopter pilots and barristers to business owners and people who are unemployed. One of the group#s main roles has been helping to deliver some of the , scrubs made by volunteers in their own homes on behalf of NI Scrubs Group. Mr Lawson said: There were so many iniduals and community and sewing groups out there making the PPE but there was no mechanism to get the items from A to B, so we filled that gap. Fourteen-year-old Jamie Watson actually uploaded mask frames for D photocopiers and started printing them off himself. There were wee factories all over the place making components for the NHS frames and we were collecting dferent elements of those so they could be put together. We wanted to take the pressure off the NHS. As well as travelling all over Ireland, the volunteers have also teamed up with motorcycle groups in the Republic and other parts of the UK to guarantee items reach their intended targets. One such delivery was from Wigan to Omagh Hospital and Lisnaskea Health Centre, with the local volunteers travelling to Cairnryan to collect the items from the English riders. All of the volunteers have been #cleared# through Access NI for pharmacy deliveries, and the group also received a tracking system - donated by UK company Microlise - which allows it to monitor its riders and deliveries. It means it can supply authorities with details of where riders have beenCovid- contact tracing should be required. Co-volunteer Phil Johnston explained that riders are still out seven days a week. Despite relaxation we still find there are some people not willing to risk leaving home and we are supporting them with deliveries of prescriptions and PPE, he explained. And the group has no plans to stop any time soon. We do feel there is benefit to us and the wider community in remaining. Options include support for blood bikes, transplant movements and other areas where the health service will need all the support it can get, he said. Plus, we are reluctant to step back in the event there is a second wave. Mr Lawson said the support and feedback the group had received had been phenomenal. It#s a privilege for us to do this. This has drawn together the entire motorcycle community in Northern Ireland and we almost feel we are carrying a banner for the bikers of Northern Ireland, he added.It is why we don#t accept any money. We feel aswe are giving something back.

Surgeries were put on hold at the Children#s Hospital in Belfast when the restrictions were first introduced in March.This meant the young patient had to endure further months of an exhausting regime of kidney dialysis seven nights a week, making it uncertain he could even start primary school this year.After carefully studying the risks involved of operating during the pandemic, his medical team asked the family to take a leap of faith and perform the surgery.The operation followed the success of the adult renal and nephrology service, who have performed around  transplants from deceased donors since the start of lockdown.Dr Karl McKeever is the patient#s consultant and clinical director in the Children#s Hospital.He told the Belfastit was a proud day for the team after a frightening period when all bets were off on when surgeries for children could resume.He also spoke of the touching moment the young boy celebrated on the ward after his operation.Everybody was very frightened about what lay ahead, he said.This particular patient was already teed up for a transplant because of high clinical need before the pandemic.That had to be postponed and the clock was ticking because other patients can sadly die on dialysis.That has been the case in other parts of the world that have been harder hit and haven#t been able to start their services.The team faced a dficult decision between protecting the donor and patient from Covid- and the harm of doing nothing.Work started with Dr Mairead Convery, a consultant paediatric nephrologist, networking with management in the Belfast Trust and other experts across the UK to assess the risk.After collecting enough data, the team concluded that with the proper safety measures, the risk of Covid- to the donor and patient was small.It#s been a very exciting time amidst all the bad times, said Dr McKeever. It#s so transforming for the family who have had to take that leap of faith.The impact of dialysis and what families have to go through needs to be seen to be believed and is very humbling for us.He continued: I always remember when the little boy ed to the ward a few days after his surgery and chanted #We did it, we did it!#It was particularly interesting to see the awareness he had at such a young age about what was going on in society around them.He understood why it had been held up, so to see it come off in such a good way with all of the team involved was amazing.Between two and six kidney transplants are usually performed at the Children#s Hospital each year.The numbers are low so it wasn#t a worry we couldn#t catch up, but it was the risk to the patients as the days went by on dialysis waiting for this le-changing surgery, Dr McKeever said.So, it#s just been super for this wee man and his family. After going through so much in recent years, I#d say they#re not entering a new chapter as much as a new book.Dr Convery added she was absolutely delighted to be first paediatric centre in the UK and Ireland to perform a living donor transplant during lockdown and thanked staff for their perseverance in giving a child the most amazing gt.Most importantly, we would like to thank our patient, their family and the donor for their courage and cooperation throughout the process.

Singing is also discouraged, and the passing of an offering plate among worshippers must not be your practice for the foreseeable future.The document says that in relation to the administration of the sacraments, guidance is still being considered by Church leaders and will be communicated in due course.Rev Trevor Gribben, clerk to the General Assembly, said the lockdown restrictions had been a painful experience for worshippers. The past three months of lockdown across the island of Ireland has presented unprecedented challenges, he said. For our ministers and congregations, this has included the enforced closure of our church buildings and an inability to meet together for worship face-to-face. While undoubtedly this has been a painful experience for many, I have been encouraged to see how our people have adapted to share God#s Word creatively online, and keep in contact with members and others in the community through phone calls, emails and old-fashioned letters.He said theto normal church services posed more complex problems than the sudden closure had. As lockdown restrictions gradually ease, our congregations must think carefully and responsibly about the practical preparations necessary to facilitate theof worship services and other aspects of church le, he added. Each congregation#s circumstances will be dferent and they will come to a iety of decisions about what activities to recommence, and how quickly this can happen. However, meeting together with brothers and sisters in Christ is central to Christian le and a primary expression of church as the family of God.And we look forward to having the opportunity to do so once again.Belfast Most ReadPastor Barrie Halliday charged after Black Lives Matter commentsNorthern Ireland teachers hit back at DUP MP Wilson#s #shameful and reckless# jibes overto class Coronavirus Northern Ireland: Two further Covid- deaths confirmedLinfield chairman says club will not be dropping new kit design after UVF comparisonsWe#ll protect NI war statues from attack, vow veterans as fears grow over violence ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

He provided a Unionist voice in the Seanad so I would be providing something dferent.”“I believe I represent the growing middle ground in Northern Ireland and have campaigned for protections for both the nationalist and unionist communities.“I have no political background and have worked tirelessly as a campaigner for the past few years. Many Irish citizens in the North feel like second class citizens so I want to be able to provide a voice for them.”The Taoiseach of the next government is empowered to nominate  appointees but a new government has yet to be formed. It is expected at least one of these will be from Northern Ireland.Government formation talks continued between Fine Gael, Fianna Fail and the Green Party on Saturday.Deputy Green Party leader Catherine Martin said they hope to get a deal done over the weekend.If a programme for government is agreed, it must be voted on by the membership of all the parties in order for it to pass.This would mean a government is likely to be formed at the end of June or the start of July.PAMost ReadPastor Barrie Halliday charged after Black Lives Matter commentsNorthern Ireland teachers hit back at DUP MP Wilson#s #shameful and reckless# jibes overto class Coronavirus Northern Ireland: Two further Covid- deaths confirmedLinfield chairman says club will not be dropping new kit design after UVF comparisonsWe#ll protect NI war statues from attack, vow veterans as fears grow over violence ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Lieutenant Billy Richardson.Flanked by Vice Admiral Tony Johnstone-Burt, master of her royal household, and Lieutenant Colonel Michael Vernon, the Comptroller, the Queen watched as the colour was carried by the Ensign.On the warm summer’s day she wore a Stewart Parvin outfit in muted jade, a Rachel Trevor-Morgan hat and the brooch of the Welsh Guards – a diamond leek.Guardsman Morgan is one of two female Guardsmen who joined the Welsh Guards earlier this year and although she became the first woman to appear on parade for the Queen’s birthday, she has already been assigned to duties as Queen’s Guard at royal palaces.After the troops and the Massed Band of the Household Division marched off, the Queen left and could be seen talking animatedly with hand gestures to the senior members of her household.PAMost ReadPastor Barrie Halliday charged after Black Lives Matter commentsNorthern Ireland teachers hit back at DUP MP Wilson#s #shameful and reckless# jibes overto class Coronavirus

His younger years coincided with a bright spell in the clubs history. He spoke to Michael McMullan about losing championships, winning the John McLaughlin Cup and building for the future. Gutty McGlone is no dferent to any other competitor. Defeat hits him like a sledgehammer. It festers to the very pit of his stomach. Its county final afternoon in  and an emerging Lavey team savour the sweet aroma of victory. Inside, in the corner of the Glen dressing room, McGlone reflects. The remnants of their - to - defeat get tossed through his mind again, something only disappointment can do. googletag.cmd.push The pitter patter of water in the adjoining shower area stops. The noise you only hear above the eerie silence of failure. John McErlain, Liam Devlin and Damian Barton emerge. Their confab draws a common conclusion. They had left three titles behind them. Next year will be dferent. In , -year-old McGlones debut season, the Bridge didnt stand up for themselves in the championship against Ballinderry, before losing the game. Eamonn Coleman was manager and after making him a regular from the mid-point of the league, Hugh wasnt selected for the championship defeat to the Shamrocks, with Coleman later confessing it was about protecting him for a career ahead. He just wasnt ready. googletag.cmd.push Three years earlier, torn ligaments in McGlones right ankle, sustained in school action for St Pius, worked out for the best. “Before that, I couldnt kick with my weak foot,” recalls Hugh, who would later coach at underage and engineer the foundations for the current senior team. He remembers the late Brendan Convery insisting on ato school training once he could walk, before arming him with a bag of balls. “Convery made me stand on the and kick every ball into the goals with my left foot. The next week, he made me go to the ,” McGlone clearly remembers. The man who managed Laveys All-Ireland winning team was developing McGlone without him even knowing. “I gradually got stronger and stronger and thats where I ended up playing at left corner back for the Bridge seniors at , because I had two feet and was able to go up the line...that was all down to Brendan Convery.” St Pius annexed an U Vocational Schools All-Ireland, with McGlone on board. A year later, in , Derry minors, who played most of the game with  men following the first-minute dismissal of Gregory McCloskey, were beaten by a point in Newry by Down, who went on to win the All-Ireland. McGlone lined out at corner back and a year more experienced, had established himself as a regular on the Bridge senior team. Once again, they crossed paths with Ballinderry. After having previously taken two games to beat Magherafelt, they met the Shamrocks in the infamous semi-final replay encounter at Greenlough. Newbridge came through to play Dungiven in a final.  The Newbridge team pictured before the  Derry senior final It wasnt to be. Newbridge were going to stand their ground this time. Familiarity bred contempt and after another tempestuous battle with the Shamrocks, which saw pitch invasions, Newbridge were thrown out leaving Dungiven to be awarded the title in the boardroom. Losing was becoming a habit and in the aftermath of their  defeat, before leaving Glen, they made a pact. “We are going to learn from this,” McGlone relays of the collective dressing room message. “We left one , we didnt get playing in oneand now we have lost one. We are not going to lose another one.” *** You earned your corn at Newbridge training. The championship jersey wasnt handed out willy nilly. Gutty McGlone, the youngest of seven boys in a house of  children, would leave home for the short walk to the hall for a Saturday pre-championship meeting before the  final. He was unnecessarily uneasy. “Im not sure of my position here,” McGlone thought. He was ever-present and never substituted during the year, but Stephen Walls, an All-Ireland minor winner with Derry in , was breathing down McGlones neck. “Thats the class of player we had on the bench. I knew I had played well, but because of the competition at the time in the Newbridge team, I was thinking I could get a gunk here I knew the pressure was on, thats why you had to perform.” It was an era that secured back-to-back senior leagues in  and , as well as three reserve championships inside five years. “This just wasnt about the senior team, those three teams were the pinnacle of us winning thechampionship in ,” McGlone stated, in no uncertain terms. Before emphasising it again. “We played games at training during ...it was a senior team against a reserve team. We struggled to beat them, so that shows you the class of talent we had in Newbridge at that time.” McGlone name-checks Mickey McGrogan and Shane Doherty as some of the forwards who trotted into his left corner back area in training games, players not even listed on the -man match-day  for the final. And they gave him his fill of it. “Then, you had big Hugh McGrogan, Paudis Da, running around at midfield, kicking the shite out of Damian Barton. There was no respect given whatsoever.” It was dog eat dog. And it needed to be. This was to be the year. “Rabbiand Sam , our managers, picked  seniors against  reserves, so we would learn how to play together in games.” The seniors never overran their reserve counterparts. “Not a chance,” Gutty stresses. The seniors never won by any more than four or five points, with the reserves winning the odd game. It worked wonders when it mattered. “Any time we were down by a couple of points , that team didnt know when it was beat. Now it mightnt have been the silkiest team, but boys just never quit,” Hugh admits. After three years of knocking on the door, with the pain of defeat lingering like a dark cloud and with the younger players beginning to mature, it was time to die dog or shite the licence. *** There was another ingredient. Sam Bateson is described by McGlone as the tactician with his managerial partner Thomas Fullerton also knowing his football. The perfect match. Fullerton, a reserve winning captain, was playing with McGlone in a  Graham Cup game. Magherafelt were running them ragged and led by six or seven points at the interval. “It was one of the first times I saw we had steel and other teams didnt have, Thomas went f**king ballistic at half-time,” Gutty remembers. It was a watershed moment. The law was laid down. Like the rest of the team, McGlone imposed himself. They were like men possessed and won the game well. “I was niggling with my man and remember him filling my mouth when we began to get on top,” said McGlone, who walked off the pitch with blood running out of his nose. “Hes not playing football in the next round, but we are,” Rabbi uttered to him, with a laugh. “Thats when I thought, the odd slap in the mouth doesnt matter, as long as you come out on the right side of it.” Another piece of valuable advice was dished out by John McErlain who often played in front of him on the left wing. In his early days, McGlone would often hoof the ball to safety. As a young buck, and under pressure, it was safer than getting caught in possession. “John roared at me one day in a league game,” he remembers. “I was told to either use the ball up the wing or just lay it off. Its those wee things that helps you when you are growing up.” As the  season began to grow, Newbridge beat  champions Bellaghy in the first round, followed by a hard-earned victory over  winners Glenullin and a semi-final encounter win over Banagher. It took them to the decider against neighbours Castledawson. Midway through the first-half, Brian McErlain was sent off. In the reshuffle, Damian Barton dropped back to centre-back. “Damian was that good with the long pass, that we didnt really have to attack and we could keep six at the back,” McGlone said of his captain. “He was able to get the ball to Devand Paddy Barton up there. On that day, I thought the Newbridge defence was outstanding...everybody. It was tight, it was hard hitting and Castledawson didnt get going.” They knew that Eamonn Heaney wasnt going to make Dawsons starting team, but would play a part. He had played at full-back in the  final, but was now threw in at full-forward to help rescue the game. It wasnt long before Rabbi was out over the sideline to instruct McGlone to do a marking job on Colm McKee for the remainder of the game, having blotted out the substituted Mickey Hughes. “Neither me or Colm touched the ball, but the management had trust in us. I was the youngest man on our team and they were happy to leave me on their county man.” Having played in three county finals and losing two of them, McGlone – who has a memory for detail that matches his enthusiasm – always remembers the call for stewards to pick up their end of match positions. “Its one of the worst feelings you could have as a footballer when you are getting beat by two or three points,” he recalls. One year on from hearing it against Lavey in , they led Castledawson when the announcement bellowed out. He remembers dampening Eoin Gribbins joy at the thought of having their clutches on that elusive championship. “One goal and they are back in it,” McGlone warned him. “In the Lavey game, it seemed to last  seconds until the final whistle, but when it was called that year , we were ahead...it seemed like an eternity until the whistle.” Newbridge were not to be caught. They kept their promise from  months earlier and Damian Barton collected the John McLaughlin Cup after a -year gap, for their th and last title. From McGlones recollection, win lose or draw, Wilfie Garvin, Mick McKenna, Jim Gilmore, Seamus and Dermot Doherty, Owen and Willie Gribbin would always be in the Newbridge dressing room after games. They were part of the teams fabric. “I remember those boys being in the day we won it and I was never as glad to see it. Its one of the wee things I will always remember.” Later in the evening the team went for a meal at the ONeill Arms in Toome, before heading back to Newbridge Hall for the celebrations. McGlone wasnt a teetotaller, he enjoyed a drink like most of the others and it was curbed during the championship preparations. “I never touched drink the night we won the championship, not one pint,” Gutty said of his premeditated decision. “I wanted to savour the whole thing and not to be talking to the older men around the club and me maybe half tight.” The next two or three days were dferent. Between the Elk and the Thatch, it was party central. On the Monday night, the squad did a tour of Newbridge on the back of Mick McKennas lorry.   Derry champions Newbridge “Everyone was on the back of er,” Gutty laughs. “We went down to Toome to pick up Stephen McErlain and then did every road in Newbridge. You wouldve thought there were  cars behind us. For the next two or three days, I dont think we sobered.” They were at the top of Everest. But surprisingly, being one of the most consistent teams of the time, it was the only senior championship that crop won. In , they took the foot off the pedal and lost to Ballinascreen in the semi-final who were beaten by eventual All-Ireland champions Lavey. “In  Eugene Young came in to manage us and we got to the final. We missed two goals and theyscored two goals, that was the dference in us winning another one.” While picking up intermediate silverware in the interim, he recalls the disappointment of relegation in  after surviving for three or four seasons in play-offs. “To start your career with a championship medal in your pocket at  or , struggling and relegation was tough. To go from being top of the pile...from walking around behind bands, to relegation, it was tough.” McGlone picked up an intermediate medal in , but when the same title ed five years later, he had stepped away from the seniors, choosing to play with the reserves. Gutty was coaxed out back into the senior ranks by manager Gavin Devlin for an impact role at full-forward, using his guile to pull full-back lines of position. A dead leg suffered in , a niggle that never fully cleared up told McGlone it was time to pull the pin. In retirement, he was never going to step away from the game he loved. The buzz in his voice, with every word dancing, speaks volumes for his fanaticism for football. He stayed on as long as he could, with the club having little youth coming through. It was time to dig new foundations and survey the lie of the land in the local school. “There were big numbers from U down, so we decided wed start with the underage,” states Hugh, who had the help of Neil Young, Martin Gribbin and Gabriel Farren. It was the clubs first U U group, as part of a unofficial South Derry underage initiative. With clubs coaching for three weeks and playing a blitz on the fourth week. “We couldnt believe it, when all  of them turned up at the first session,” he said of a group that supplied seven players to the senior team beaten by Slaughtneil in last years championship. “By U, CKcame in to help. He had taken teams around Newbridge that boysdidnt want, hed step up. Noel McPeake and Sean McKenna came in too and helped.” After winning the U B league and championship, McGlone took a break before ing at minor level and asked for another step up in class. At the pre-season meeting he asked those in the room with two B medals to stand up. “About  percent stood up and when asked who has at least one , and the rest of them stood,” McGlone states. It was time to move up to the A grade. In their first game, they were away to Slaughtneil and unlucky not to beat a team who were U champions two years earlier. After losing heavily to Magherafelt in the Hughes McElwee Cup, the league game between them finished in a draw.  The  Newbridge U U  “If you win a Byou have to step up to A. We were not going to win anything. If we played somebody and there was  points in it and we played them a second day and there was two points in it, we are progressing.” McGlone expressed. He was looking further down the track. His sons are now playing on the senior team, he helped shape. In recent years, they picked up another intermediate title and are back in the top flight. Hopefully to stay. “Now we have a  again that,nurtured right, can dine at the top table again. Hopefully...I am one of the men that is going in around the dressing room in the next five or six years like the older boys did when we won.” Guttys fanaticism has never diluted, nor is it likely to.

Before emphasising it again. “We played games at training during ...it was a senior team against a reserve team. We struggled to beat them, so that shows you the class of talent we had in Newbridge at that time.” McGlone name-checks Mickey McGrogan and Shane Doherty as some of the forwards who trotted into his left corner back area in training games, players not even listed on the -man match-day  for the final. And they gave him his fill of it. “Then, you had big Hugh McGrogan, Paudis Da, running around at midfield, kicking the shite out of Damian Barton. There was no respect given whatsoever.” It was dog eat dog. And it needed to be. This was to be the year. “Rabbiand Sam , our managers, picked  seniors against  reserves, so we would learn how to play together in games.” The seniors never overran their reserve counterparts. “Not a chance,” Gutty stresses. The seniors never won by any more than four or five points, with the reserves winning the odd game. It worked wonders when it mattered. “Any time we were down by a couple of points , that team didnt know when it was beat. Now it mightnt have been the silkiest team, but boys just never quit,” Hugh admits. After three years of knocking on the door, with the pain of defeat lingering like a dark cloud and with the younger players beginning to mature, it was time to die dog or shite the licence. *** There was another ingredient. Sam Bateson is described by McGlone as the tactician with his managerial partner Thomas Fullerton also knowing his football. The perfect match. Fullerton, a reserve winning captain, was playing with McGlone in a  Graham Cup game. Magherafelt were running them ragged and led by six or seven points at the interval. “It was one of the first times I saw we had steel and other teams didnt have, Thomas went f**king ballistic at half-time,” Gutty remembers. It was a watershed moment. The law was laid down. Like the rest of the team, McGlone imposed himself. They were like men possessed and won the game well. “I was niggling with my man and remember him filling my mouth when we began to get on top,” said McGlone, who walked off the pitch with blood running out of his nose. “Hes not playing football in the next round, but we are,” Rabbi uttered to him, with a laugh. “Thats when I thought, the odd slap in the mouth doesnt matter, as long as you come out on the right side of it.” Another piece of valuable advice was dished out by John McErlain who often played in front of him on the left wing. In his early days, McGlone would often hoof the ball to safety. As a young buck, and under pressure, it was safer than getting caught in possession. “John roared at me one day in a league game,” he remembers. “I was told to either use the ball up the wing or just lay it off. Its those wee things that helps you when you are growing up.” As the  season began to grow, Newbridge beat  champions Bellaghy in the first round, followed by a hard-earned victory over  winners Glenullin and a semi-final encounter win over Banagher. It took them to the decider against neighbours Castledawson. Midway through the first-half, Brian McErlain was sent off. In the reshuffle, Damian Barton dropped back to centre-back. “Damian was that good with the long pass, that we didnt really have to attack and we could keep six at the back,” McGlone said of his captain. “He was able to get the ball to Devand Paddy Barton up there. On that day, I thought the Newbridge defence was outstanding...everybody. It was tight, it was hard hitting and Castledawson didnt get going.” They knew that Eamonn Heaney wasnt going to make Dawsons starting team, but would play a part. He had played at full-back in the  final, but was now threw in at full-forward to help rescue the game. It wasnt long before Rabbi was out over the sideline to instruct McGlone to do a marking job on Colm McKee for the remainder of the game, having blotted out the substituted Mickey Hughes. “Neither me or Colm touched the ball, but the management had trust in us. I was the youngest man on our team and they were happy to leave me on their county man.” Having played in three county finals and losing two of them, McGlone – who has a memory for detail that matches his enthusiasm – always remembers the call for stewards to pick up their end of match positions. “Its one of the worst feelings you could have as a footballer when you are getting beat by two or three points,” he recalls. One year on from hearing it against Lavey in , they led Castledawson when the announcement bellowed out. He remembers dampening Eoin Gribbins joy at the thought of having their clutches on that elusive championship. “One goal and they are back in it,” McGlone warned him. “In the Lavey game, it seemed to last  seconds until the final whistle, but when it was called that year , we were ahead...it seemed like an eternity until the whistle.” Newbridge were not to be caught. They kept their promise from  months earlier and Damian Barton collected the John McLaughlin Cup after a -year gap, for their th and last title. From McGlones recollection, win lose or draw, Wilfie Garvin, Mick McKenna, Jim Gilmore, Seamus and Dermot Doherty, Owen and Willie Gribbin would always be in the Newbridge dressing room after games. They were part of the teams fabric. “I remember those boys being in the day we won it and I was never as glad to see it. Its one of the wee things I will always remember.” Later in the evening the team went for a meal at the ONeill Arms in Toome, before heading back to Newbridge Hall for the celebrations. McGlone wasnt a teetotaller, he enjoyed a drink like most of the others and it was curbed during the championship preparations. “I never touched drink the night we won the championship, not one pint,” Gutty said of his premeditated decision. “I wanted to savour the whole thing and not to be talking to the older men around the club and me maybe half tight.” The next two or three days were dferent. Between the Elk and the Thatch, it was party central. On the Monday night, the squad did a tour of Newbridge on the back of Mick McKennas lorry.   Derry champions Newbridge “Everyone was on the back of er,” Gutty laughs. “We went down to Toome to pick up Stephen McErlain and then did every road in Newbridge. You wouldve thought there were  cars behind us. For the next two or three days, I dont think we sobered.” They were at the top of Everest. But surprisingly, being one of the most consistent teams of the time, it was the only senior championship that crop won. In , they took the foot off the pedal and lost to Ballinascreen in the semi-final who were beaten by eventual All-Ireland champions Lavey. “In  Eugene Young came in to manage us and we got to the final. We missed two goals and theyscored two goals, that was the dference in us winning another one.” While picking up intermediate silverware in the interim, he recalls the disappointment of relegation in  after surviving for three or four seasons in play-offs. “To start your career with a championship medal in your pocket at  or , struggling and relegation was tough. To go from being top of the pile...from walking around behind bands, to relegation, it was tough.” McGlone picked up an intermediate medal in , but when the same title ed five years later, he had stepped away from the seniors, choosing to play with the reserves. Gutty was coaxed out back into the senior ranks by manager Gavin Devlin for an impact role at full-forward, using his guile to pull full-back lines of position. A dead leg suffered in , a niggle that never fully cleared up told McGlone it was time to pull the pin. In retirement, he was never going to step away from the game he loved. The buzz in his voice, with every word dancing, speaks volumes for his fanaticism for football. He stayed on as long as he could, with the club having little youth coming through. It was time to dig new foundations and survey the lie of the land in the local school. “There were big numbers from U down, so we decided wed start with the underage,” states Hugh, who had the help of Neil Young, Martin Gribbin and Gabriel Farren. It was the clubs first U U group, as part of a unofficial South Derry underage initiative. With clubs coaching for three weeks and playing a blitz on the fourth week. “We couldnt believe it, when all  of them turned up at the first session,” he said of a group that supplied seven players to the senior team beaten by Slaughtneil in last years championship. “By U, CKcame in to help. He had taken teams around Newbridge that boysdidnt want, hed step up. Noel McPeake and Sean McKenna came in too and helped.” After winning the U B league and championship, McGlone took a break before ing at minor level and asked for another step up in class. At the pre-season meeting he asked those in the room with two B medals to stand up. “About  percent stood up and when asked who has at least one , and the rest of them stood,” McGlone states. It was time to move up to the A grade. In their first game, they were away to Slaughtneil and unlucky not to beat a team who were U champions two years earlier. After losing heavily to Magherafelt in the Hughes McElwee Cup, the league game between them finished in a draw.  The  Newbridge U U  “If you win a Byou have to step up to A. We were not going to win anything. If we played somebody and there was  points in it and we played them a second day and there was two points in it, we are progressing.” McGlone expressed. He was looking further down the track. His sons are now playing on the senior team, he helped shape. In recent years, they picked up another intermediate title and are back in the top flight. Hopefully to stay. “Now we have a  again that,nurtured right, can dine at the top table again. Hopefully...I am one of the men that is going in around the dressing room in the next five or six years like the older boys did when we won.” Guttys fanaticism has never diluted, nor is it likely to.

GAA GOLD, a new archive based series from TG, looks back at the ’s through the prism of the GAA year.  Each programme focuses on one year and we travel through the GAA season with a mixture of all of the classic games, news stories and music hits from that year. The first programme of the series starts with the year and the programmecharts that year’s twists and turns on Gaelic fields throughout the land with league finals, provincial finals, All-Ireland semi-finals and All-Ireland finals. That year end ends with Joe Connolly’s emotional and evocative speech on the steps of the Hogan Stand with the cheeky line of “People of Galway, we love you! googletag.cmd.push In  All Ireland Football Final, there was Seacuteamus Darbys famous goal that shocked Kerry - and the nation - to end their five in-a-row hopes. In the Hurling Final the Cats claimed their nd All-Ireland title captained by a young man named Brian Cody. In  we will see Jimmy Barry-Murphy’s famous rocket goal against Galway in the All-Ireland semi-final. Michael O’Hehir on commentary said“This is one you need to see in slow motion but the slow motion won’t even slow it down!”.  In the Minor hurling final there is a young man named Niall Quinn playing for the Dubs against Galway. He scored a great point on the day and would go on to score  international goals for the Republic of Ireland soccer team. The Football Final that year saw  players sent off in the Dublin v Galway battle. googletag.cmd.push The series will include the  Ulster Football Final - Frank McGuigan was on fire for Tyrone that day and scored  points from play - each one better than the last as Tyrone claimed their first provincial title since  in Clones.  This was also the GAA’s centenary year with the All-Ireland Hurling Final held in Semple Stadium between Cork and Offaly. We hwill see the first ever International Rules tests between Ireland and Australia from that year with plenty of action on and off the ball. In  we have some action from the first ever Ladies Football Final to be played at Croke Park. The Kerry’s Ladies team went one better than the men as they claimed a‘five in-a-row’ with victory over Wexford. There are other more quirkier events in the GAA season too. In  a National Football League Quarter-final between Dublin and Cork ended in a draw. Cork failed to reappear for extra-time so Dublin ran the ball down unopposed and shot into an empty Cork net to claim a very unusual victory. All of these great memories can be seen in this new GAA GOLD series with the soundtrack of the era - a mix of both international and Irish acts such as U, Thin Lizzy, The Pogues, Mamas Boys, The Undertones, Cry Before Dawn, Sineacutead O’Connor, The Dubliners, The Hothouse Flowers, The Stunning and many more.

It was the greatest walk of all and following the opening of Shamrock Park, following the sporting lockdown, they are again thinking of that famous journey to Thurles. On the re-opening of walkways around GAA grounds, this was an opportunity to get people back out again socialising as a club community and using the club grounds with their Trip  Tipp initiative. The idea was to get as many families as possible out walking, running or crawling, each doing a  mile leg of the  mile journey in allocated, socially distanced, safe slots. googletag.cmd.push A pound contribution per family was requested, with all proceeds going to aid football and camogie youth restarting back training, with the expected rules and regulations that will surely be in place. The uptake was fantastic with  families taking partand more families looking to take part every day so they surpassed their  mile journey!. The club wish to place on record their thanks to all those that participated or helped out in any way preparing the grounds, sorting and fitting hand sanitizers, marking the walkways for one way social distance adherence, with special mention to Paul McIver who was the driving force behind this excellent initiative. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

When he came out of the changing room bearing a grey hoodie, with the rest of his team-mates in black and white, you wondered had he even got a jersey. But whatever he dreamt about on the night before, whatever he thought about over dinner, he wouldn’t have believed he would have scored an injury-time goal to win the trophy for his new club and win the man of the match award. googletag.cmd.push That’s exactly how it panned out. The sides level at - apiece, thirty seconds of injury-time played, and a long ball is spilled and flapped at by Ronan Tracey in the Foreglen goal. Poaching on the edge of the small square , as he did time and again in the green and gold jersey, it was a simple task for O’Kane to punch home the winning goal. Some ironies are just written in the stars. This one came in spite of every single ounce of effort Foreglen had to give. Kevin O’Connor was O’Kane’s partner in crime since the two were knee high. They tormented defences in Intermediate football for years. They fought shoulder to shoulder for the green and the gold. googletag.cmd.push O’Connor played like a man possessed. He played like a man who wanted to show the world he didn’t need a partner. The Foreglen forward took Rian Kealey, a superb player, to the cleaners. O’Connor ended up with five points and set up his side’s goal in a magnicent display. That goal, made by O’Connor and finished by James Brolly, looked as though it had swung the balance in the favour of the underdogs with just four minutes to go. Having been behind from the th minute of a rather stagnant first half, Foreglen had worked incredibly hard to stay in touch with the Magpies. A combination of wasteful finishing from Eugene Kelly’s menand superb defending from a young full-back line of Ruairi and Shane Duffy and Cathal O’Hara kept Damien O’Connor’s side in contention. This was no holds barred football. For the young Dungiven side, sprinkled with Kevin Farren, Kevin Johnston, Sean Murray and Donal McGilligan of last year’s minor team, this was probably the toughest game they’ve played, in a physical sense at least. For that, you have to give Foreglen great credit. Brothers John and Oisin Duffy were lost to their defence before the game, having set off travelling on Friday. They’re without Niall McFeely long term. To most teams with as small a pick, those absentees would be terminal against a side that contained six players that played in last year’s senior county final. But when have Foreglen ever laid down  Kevin O’Connor might have kicked the points, but the spadework was done by plenty other. Ciaran McFeely had an excellent game, the best he’s played in some while. He went after everything, especially in the second half. Darren O’Kane’s heart is bigger than his chest. There’s not much of him, but he ploughs into everything. He’s pretty much the Foreglen prototype. They felt the big decisions didn’t go their way. They may have had a point. Directly after Brolly’s goal, Martin Farrell latched on to a great ball from Darren O’Kane. He appeared to be fouled in front of goal but referee Joe Mulholland blew him for over-carrying. Ninety seconds after what turned out to be Darrell O’Kane’s winning goal, Kevin O’Connor was pushed in the chest inside the area as he collected the ball. The referee felt he went down too easily and played on. But for all the feeling of the world being against them, they were lucky to still be in the game at half-time. Having played with a fresh breeze, they were frustrated by constant stoppages over a stop-start  minutes. With  minutes of -a-side football played, the score was just - apiece. It hadn’t caught fire at all. But Dungiven were missing what chances were being made. They kicked ten wides in that half hour. Foreglen had just three points at the break, but just as importantly, they had conceded just five. What the fans were treated to in the second half was night and day from what they had got in the first. It became a rip-roaring game. It effectively became championship. The first seven minutes of the half were scoreless. The stage seemed set. James McNicholl got out well and fed the man coming off his shoulder. That man fired brilliantly past Ronan Tracey from twelve yards. That man had no fear of celebrating his goal. That man was, of course, Darrell O’Kane. Foreglen seemed to react to the identity of the scorer as much as the goal itself. They responded in the most positive manner. Martin Farrell , Ciaran McFeely, Kevin O’Connor and James Brolly hit points in six brilliant minutes to close the gap back to two. Dungiven’s only response in those six minutes came from O’Kane’s right foot. Kevin O’Connor was not letting it go without a fight. His storming run saw Rian Kealey pull him to the ground along the endline. He got up and sprinted out to the ’ and with Dungiven sleeping, took a quick free that left James Brolly with a relatively simple finish from  yards. That levelled it with just four minutes to play. But they couldn’t quite get the score they needed to nose themselves in front. They just didn’t have anything to hold on to. Substitute Fergal McGuigan kicked a  yard free wide and it seemed as though the gods, having rescued Kerry earlier in the day, had dressed themselves in green and gold. But it just had to be Darrell O’Kane’s day. Of all the men in all the world, it just had to be him.

To most teams with as small a pick, those absentees would be terminal against a side that contained six players that played in last year’s senior county final. But when have Foreglen ever laid down  Kevin O’Connor might have kicked the points, but the spadework was done by plenty other. Ciaran McFeely had an excellent game, the best he’s played in some while. He went after everything, especially in the second half. Darren O’Kane’s heart is bigger than his chest. There’s not much of him, but he ploughs into everything. He’s pretty much the Foreglen prototype. They felt the big decisions didn’t go their way. They may have had a point. Directly after Brolly’s goal, Martin Farrell latched on to a great ball from Darren O’Kane. He appeared to be fouled in front of goal but referee Joe Mulholland blew him for over-carrying. Ninety seconds after what turned out to be Darrell O’Kane’s winning goal, Kevin O’Connor was pushed in the chest inside the area as he collected the ball. The referee felt he went down too easily and played on. But for all the feeling of the world being against them, they were lucky to still be in the game at half-time. Having played with a fresh breeze, they were frustrated by constant stoppages over a stop-start  minutes. With  minutes of -a-side football played, the score was just - apiece. It hadn’t caught fire at all. But Dungiven were missing what chances were being made. They kicked ten wides in that half hour. Foreglen had just three points at the break, but just as importantly, they had conceded just five. What the fans were treated to in the second half was night and day from what they had got in the first. It became a rip-roaring game. It effectively became championship. The first seven minutes of the half were scoreless. The stage seemed set. James McNicholl got out well and fed the man coming off his shoulder. That man fired brilliantly past Ronan Tracey from twelve yards. That man had no fear of celebrating his goal. That man was, of course, Darrell O’Kane. Foreglen seemed to react to the identity of the scorer as much as the goal itself. They responded in the most positive manner. Martin Farrell , Ciaran McFeely, Kevin O’Connor and James Brolly hit points in six brilliant minutes to close the gap back to two. Dungiven’s only response in those six minutes came from O’Kane’s right foot. Kevin O’Connor was not letting it go without a fight. His storming run saw Rian Kealey pull him to the ground along the endline. He got up and sprinted out to the ’ and with Dungiven sleeping, took a quick free that left James Brolly with a relatively simple finish from  yards. That levelled it with just four minutes to play. But they couldn’t quite get the score they needed to nose themselves in front. They just didn’t have anything to hold on to. Substitute Fergal McGuigan kicked a  yard free wide and it seemed as though the gods, having rescued Kerry earlier in the day, had dressed themselves in green and gold. But it just had to be Darrell O’Kane’s day. Of all the men in all the world, it just had to be him.

John O’Neill, from Ballinderry, took to the roads around the village to document the lives of local parishioners during the Covid- lockdown. The project is still ongoing, but Fr Peter Donnelly from St Patrick’s Church in the parish, says the donation of pound, is very welcome. “It is very much appreciated by the entire Ballinderry family as this would be additional expenditure, which has become necessary,” he told the County Derry Post. “Because of the health emergency, we’ve had to seriously think about introducing a webcam, and all of these improvements are costly, and this money will go towards that. googletag.cmd.push “It was very generous of him with his time and photography expertise. It was a kind thought indeed and it was well supported.” The project grew momentum after a local man, Charlie Collins, presented John with a list of  people in the parish who were over . “I would touch base, or say I was calling in an area on a certain day and people would get in contact,” said John. “I arranged rough times that I would call so they were watching or had a family member keeping an eye out. “The older folk were asking about how they would buy a photo, so I did a flat rate and said % would go to Fr Donnelly down in Ballinderry chapel.” googletag.cmd.push One of Johns shots from the project. Pic: John ONeill - Sperrins Photography. Fr Donnelly said the thought of a photographer doing the rounds was enough to give the parish’s elderly parishioners a boost. “The older members found it enormously important and looked forward to getting prepared to have their photographs taken,” he said. “John managed to capture their dferent personalities very well. There are many ways of taking a photo but the artistry is in capturing the character of the person themselves. “I thought he got everyone’s personality very well. Rather than people feeling a bit self-conscious or formal, he was able to put them at ease. “It was a wonderful idea and it was very heartening to see it so well supported.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

A number of complaints had been raised about the booking system put in place following the easement of coronavirus restrictions. Cllr Kathleen McGurk said some constituents had experienced dficulty when trying to make a same-day booking, but moves have since been made to improve the service. “I asked the Environmental Services Director to improve the current system to ensure there are less issues when trying to book a slot including provision same day booking,” said Cllr McGurk. “I very much welcome the improvements that the council team have now implemented and praise should be given to the quick response to the complaints. googletag.cmd.push “The new online booking systems which is being rolled out should streamline the service for all users.” The online system, which will facilitate same-day booking, will be trialled at sites in Coleraine and Limavady this week, with the council hoping to roll it out to all sites within a fortnight. The number of slots has also been increased to allow for four vehicles every ten minutes, with a view to increasing it to six vehicles this week. In the meantime, the council has increased the number of operators taking bookings to seven at centres that do not yet have the online booking system in place. googletag.cmd.push “I appreciate there have been frustrations caused by the booking system and some have called for its removal entirely,” said Cllr McGurk “However it is essential that we maintain it for the meantime to avoid the long queues and congestion seen in other Council areas. “It is also worth noting that since the introduction of the booking system, most council recycling centres are working to full capacity with slots being entirely filled for the following day. “If this wasn’t managed correctly it would lead to peak usage times which would have the potential to overwhelm staff at the centres and cause traffic issues. “Whilst this may not have been as likely a scenario in smaller recycling centres, it was important that the same approach was taken to all centres across the council area.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

These exclusive photographs show the special screens which have been erected at Tinneys Bar in Derry. All other pubs are expected to install similar screens between staff and customers as the hospitality sector reopens following the coronavirus lockdown.  A local blinds shop has been assisting Derry bars and businesses as they prepare to reopen safely. Ace Blinds have been operating in the Derry area, serving the community for over five years and employing local people. As businesses adjust to the so-called new normal after lockdown, they have to enforce social distancing and come up with innovative ways to protect their customers. googletag.cmd.push Therefore, Ace Blinds has fitted ‘COVID- roller shields’ in local bars and the orders have been mounting from other businesses in the city. “It has gone a bit crazy at the minute and we have already taken  orders for bars,” says John Kelly of Ace Blinds. It is new territory for Ace Blinds in terms of the material they are using. “The plastic material suits bars great as they can be moved up and down very easily, not like perspex, and they are a lot easier on the eye for customers, so more friendly. They can be attached to suspension ceilings with a special clip so no drillingneeds be. googletag.cmd.push “The material is easily cleaned, you just hold the bottom bar and wipe clean and it can be secured to bars or the groundneeded.” The company has fitted the bathroom at EI Engineering to separate sinks which provides an extra layer of protection for workers. Other businesses in the town have come to them with dferent proposals which they’re working through together. This week, the Economy Minister Dianne Dodds announced that all non-essential goods retailers in Northern Ireland can re-open from tomorrow. Pubs and restaurants are expected to follow suit in July. Confirming the ‘major step forward’, the Minister said: “The pandemic has had a devastating impact on the local economy. The recovery has already begun and it is time now for the pace to accelerate. The re-opening of all goods retail outlets will be a huge part of this. “The safety of staff and customers is of course paramount. All retailers must be able to implement measures that minimise the risk to their staff and to the people who visit their stores. “We will be co-existing with this virus for some time to come so it is vital that we continue to adhere to guidance to work and live safely.” The Minister added: “The re-opening of our local shopping sector is a signicant step forward in the Executive’s pathway to recovery. I and my Executive colleagues remain committed to moving forward in the recovery while at all times keeping the health, wellbeing and safety of people at the centre and being transparent in our approach.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Tucked off the Halfgain road, it is one of Slaughtneils greatest gems. Glenn, who coaches fitness in the wild outdoors with his company Wild Le, was due to celebrate his rd birthday by competing in a half triathlon, before it was cancelled due to the sporting lockdown. “I always try to do something challenging on or around my birthday. I guess it makes me feel alive as my inevitable demise looms ever closer,” Glenn said. It was time to put his creative mind to work and invent a new challenge, something on his doorstep. googletag.cmd.push “I love kettlebells and live in the middle of a nature reserve with loads of footpaths so it meant I could do the challenge without having to travel,” he points out. He has a background in combat sports, primarily Filipino Stick Fighting, is a big lover of tree climbing, cold water wild swimming. “A fellow stick fighter and kettlebell instructor, Dave Hedges, from Dublin completed a mile of swings a few years ago and sowed the seed to do it here.” As part of his challenge he aimed to raise money for local mental health charity, STEPS. After targetting pound as a total, he smashed it and currently has pound, in his Justgiving account. googletag.cmd.push “As someone who has and still does suffer from, at times acute anxiety, raising money for mental health support is a no-brainer,” he explains. “Suicide is the single biggest killer in men under the age of  and the daily number of deaths is going up for both men and women. In Northern Ireland the suicide rate is about double that of England, with almost  percent of our community suffering from mental health issues.” “We are all affected by mental health issues, either directly or indirectly, and its time for it to stop being a taboo subject.” A back injury curtailed Glenns early preparations and he switched rehab mode. His days comprised a series of flexibility routines. “The human body is remarkable at healing and movement is medicine. After a couple of weeks I felt I was good to go, so started doing kettlebell swings daily, building up in volume and then moving onto to the walking swing whereby i take a step forward at the top of each swing.” With over , swings during his iron mile, technique was everything. There was the small matter of managing his hands, such was the wear and tear from the kettlebell. “The kettlebell is constantly moving inside your grip so any hard skin or calluses there tend to rip off,” Glenn outlines. “So I had a weekly routine of filing, shaving and moisturising my hands. They are more rubbery that leathery. “I used a kg kettlebell. This would be fairly light for my average workout but after , swings it felt anything but light. If I do it again i may go up to a kg. The heat was the biggest issue. Within five minutes of his scheduled .am start, he was dripping with sweat. “I was wishing we started two hours earlier, sweat in the eyes and on the palms is less than ideal.” With about  metres to go, Glenn could feel blisters popping on his fingers, but the finish line was in sight. One year older, another challenge met and money raised for a worthwhile cause.

Tucked off the Halfgain road, it is one of Slaughtneils greatest gems. Glenn, who coaches fitness in the wild outdoors with his company Wild Le, was due to celebrate his rd birthday by competing in a half triathlon, before it was cancelled due to the sporting lockdown. “I always try to do something challenging on or around my birthday. I guess it makes me feel alive as my inevitable demise looms ever closer,” Glenn said. It was time to put his creative mind to work and invent a new challenge, something on his doorstep. googletag.cmd.push “I love kettlebells and live in the middle of a nature reserve with loads of footpaths so it meant I could do the challenge without having to travel,” he points out. He has a background in combat sports, primarily Filipino Stick Fighting, is a big lover of tree climbing, cold water wild swimming. “A fellow stick fighter and kettlebell instructor, Dave Hedges, from Dublin completed a mile of swings a few years ago and sowed the seed to do it here.” As part of his challenge he aimed to raise money for local mental health charity, STEPS. After targetting pound as a total, he smashed it and currently has pound, in his Justgiving account. googletag.cmd.push “As someone who has and still does suffer from, at times acute anxiety, raising money for mental health support is a no-brainer,” he explains. “Suicide is the single biggest killer in men under the age of  and the daily number of deaths is going up for both men and women. In Northern Ireland the suicide rate is about double that of England, with almost  percent of our community suffering from mental health issues.” “We are all affected by mental health issues, either directly or indirectly, and its time for it to stop being a taboo subject.” A back injury curtailed Glenns early preparations and he switched rehab mode. His days comprised a series of flexibility routines. “The human body is remarkable at healing and movement is medicine. After a couple of weeks I felt I was good to go, so started doing kettlebell swings daily, building up in volume and then moving onto to the walking swing whereby i take a step forward at the top of each swing.” With over , swings during his iron mile, technique was everything. There was the small matter of managing his hands, such was the wear and tear from the kettlebell. “The kettlebell is constantly moving inside your grip so any hard skin or calluses there tend to rip off,” Glenn outlines. “So I had a weekly routine of filing, shaving and moisturising my hands. They are more rubbery that leathery. “I used a kg kettlebell. This would be fairly light for my average workout but after , swings it felt anything but light. If I do it again i may go up to a kg. The heat was the biggest issue. Within five minutes of his scheduled .am start, he was dripping with sweat. “I was wishing we started two hours earlier, sweat in the eyes and on the palms is less than ideal.” With about  metres to go, Glenn could feel blisters popping on his fingers, but the finish line was in sight. One year older, another challenge met and money raised for a worthwhile cause.

initiative aimed at revitalising Ardglass harbour are expected to be published before the end of the month.Stormont fisheries minister Edwin Poots is due to unveil the first stage of a report from the Fishing and Seafood Development programme whichwill include a timeline for work that needs to be done at Ardglass and the other Co Down ports of Kilkeel and Portavogie.Earlier this year, Mr Poots met with South Down MLA Colin McGrath and local councillor Dermot Curran to discuss the future of the village port.They highlighted the importance of the Ardglass fishing industry to the district and wider South Down economy and outlined planned improvement work at the harbour, including deepening it to facilitate larger herring and mackerel vessels.Mr McGrath and Cllr Curran emphasised the need for additional investment in the harbour and its infrastructure, insisting that the port receives its fair share of funding to help enhance the existing fleet.They said that the harbour was ldquostrategically important for the Co Down fleet, highlighting its crucial role in driving the South Down economy and its location as a central hub for processing fish landed in Ardglass.The politicians said additional investment is critical to allow Ardglass harbour to expand with appropriate slipways provided for larger vessels to dock safely.Several weeks after the meeting with Mr Poots it was revealed that ambitious plans to redevelop Ardglass harbour could cost in the region of poundm.The figure is contained in a detailed consultants report commissioned to undertake an in-depth feasibility study to look at potential developments for the harbour which is home to Northern Irelandrsquos third largest fishing fleet.The key issue the consultants focused on was deepening the harbour to facilitate larger vessels, with work also undertaken to look at improving harbour conditions, berthing pontoons for smaller vessels and increased berthing facilities.In addition, the study included a comprehensive review of possible harbour layouts, historic document research, topographic and bathymetric harbour surveys, quay wall inspection above and below the waterline and computer modelling.The consultants also liaised with the Department for Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairswhich has been given a copy of the consultants report ahead of further discussions with its officials on the way forward.Ardglass has the only all-weather harbour between Howth and Bangor and has three primary areas including the so-called fish dock within the south pier.Last August, ious concept layouts produced by consultants were reviewed by members of the Ardglass Harbour Developments group which has been set up to oversee the regeneration of the port. The concepts were subsequently amended in November.The prime focus is on deepening the harbour and moving forward, a cost effective approach may be to zone dredge levels in particular areas.Cllr Curran, who is keen to hear what Mr Poots has to say in a few weeksrsquo time, said there were plans to deepen the outer harbour by nine metres and the area adjacent to Cochranersquos building at the inner harbour by two metres to facilitate crab vessels.He confirmed that consideration is also being given to creating a pontoon with finger berths adjacent to the quay wall in front of Cochranersquos with gangway access for crab vessels. No leisure craft would be permitted at this part of the harbour.ldquoNew investment in Ardglass harbour can help sustain existing jobs and create new employment opportunities, said Cllr Curran. ldquoThe port plays a ket part in the local economy and is at the heart of village le.ldquoArdglass lands some of the largest quantities of prawns in Ireland and deepening the harbour will mean that larger fishing vessels that currently dock where, will be able to access local facilities.Cllr Curran also fears that not deepening the harbour could potentially lead to an economic collapse for the Ardglass fishing industry.He added: ldquoI look forward to hear what the fisheries minister has to say towards the end of the month and hope that it will be positively good news for Ardglass..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Roadworks causing delays in town centre  ","story":"A DOWNPATRICK businesswoman has called on Phoenix Gas to complete pipe laying work in St Patrickrsquos Avenue by next Monday mdash as promised.The company is investing poundm investment across East Down and to date has laid over  miles of natural gas pipeline, with contractors also currently working in Newcastle.Phoenix officials have been working with the Department for Infrastructure to identy areas where pipe-laying could be brought forward to avoid further disruption to traders, visitors and residents, with work in Downpatrick starting several weeks ago.A mains pipeline has already been laid in a number of areas in the town, with contractors recently completing work in the Edward Street area. Contractors then moved to Pound Lane and are now in St Patrickrsquos Avenue.Eleanor Telford, who owns Telrsquos Confectionary with her husband Alan, said that she believed that the pipe-laying would start outside her shop imminently.ldquoI suppose the work has to be done sometime and perhaps itrsquos better done now when things are still quiet, but I hope the work is completed within the time we have been told, she said.Motorists have faced some delays in St Patrickrsquos Avenue which feeds into Market Street, the townrsquos main shopping area.Phoenix hopes that by expediting its multi-million pound investment programme now, it will avoid further disruption later in the year, while also providing consumers with additional access to fuel choice before the winter period.The company insists that the safety of its staff and communities is of paramount importance, with the current pipe-laying work scheduled following ldquorobust risk assessment and the implementation of additional operational procedures, in line with government guidance.Downpatrick area councillor Dermot Curran also appealed to Phoenix to complete the work as quickly as possible and for road users to remain patient during the work in the town centre which he said will result in inconvenience.He said it was always anticipated the work on such a major investment in towns and villages across the district would result in some degree of disruption and inconvenience.Cllr Curran said that the arrival of natural gas provides consumers with an added element of choice when it comes to their heating needs and said the investment in Downpatrick and right across the district opens up new opportunities to thousands of homeowners and the townrsquos business community.ldquoPipe-laying on such a large scale along congested streets and town centres results in disruption and while issues have arisen in the past, Phoenix has always done it best to minimise disruption, he said.ldquoBringing forward the work in Downpatrick, especially as schools across the town are closed as part of the coronavirus lockdown measures, makes sense.

Catching up will take a huge effort. Where are the resources for this Reading scores for example affect exam results and from there access to higher education and employment.This is serious.I can only imagine the stress and angst some parents are feeling as they struggle with home teaching.As the paper reported it is the disadvantaged who are becoming more disadvantaged. Does anyone seriously believe that children who can’t or won’t work at home at the best of times are doing so now  Many children will be falling further behind.Why aren’t we talking about how to get our children back at school  Naturally parents, children and staff are fearful of ato school, so let’s look at what the science and the scientists say. Either it is safe to go to school or it isn’t.According to the Depart ment Health Northern Ireland Dashboard one person under  has died in NI and not one under  and % of the deaths have been of people over , and the Office of National Statistics reports thatyou are under  you have a one in a million chance of dying ProfessorKarol Sikora, who holds a double first from Cambridge and wasformerly Director of Cancer services at the World Health Organisationsaid with regard to primary school and nurseries “opening schools is absolutely vital” ...“the people who are suffering most are the most disadvantaged” and “the evidence that young children spread this is almost zero”. He goes onto say ,”why wait until September ” The Chief Scientic Officer of the WHO mirrors his views.Prof John Lee, Professor of Clinical Pathology at Hull, sums it up thus “The majority of cases are asymptomatic. The most common symptoms are not fever, cough, headache and respiratory symptoms they are no symptoms at all. Somewhere around . per cent of those who catch the disease recover.”The re-opening of schools in a phased and conditional way places immense stress on principals  School Management Teamswho will have to reassure children, parents and staff whilst at the same time organising staff rotas, part class rotas, year group rotas, curriculum arrangements — say  subjects, staffing, desks ,movements, toilets, canteens, ,break times and so on and in many cases teach. In a post primary school with  in a year group – so  classes – which, with phasing, would mean with, each class ided into ,  sub groups— the school has five year groups then that is  sub groups to rotate across eg  subjects with probably a rotated staff.Similarly in a primary school, complicated by the principal with a substantial teaching commitment.How do you do it, how do you ensure continuity of education The ‘safety measures’ — masks, screens, Personal Protection Equipmentetc give the illusion of safety whilst increasing fear and anxiety and this will hugely increasethechildren do notto school soon. I see groups of children playing and associating naturally – sothey go into school and have to stay two metres apart,how absurd is that  .Mental health issues are on the increase in schools as it is — there aren’t enough resources at the moment, there is a crisis looming when the children–we continue to fill them with fear. Principals are faced with one particularly dficult dilemma. Given that the government is not putting in any extra money, the principal can phasechildren in say one day a week and they miss out on their complete education, GCSE preparation etc orthey can bring in lots of subs and run the budget into chaos, for which they willbe heavily criticised.The obstacles are insurmountable.Our children need educated in an environment conducive to learning, not one filled with fear and anxiety. Feedback from the teacher and social interaction is what makes learning happen, why the need for complicated and impractical phasing  It is either safe or it isn’t.Michael Fullan, the esteemed educationalist said, “scratch a good teacher and you will find a moral purpose” and now is surely the time to demonstrate our moral purpose as public servants. Surely it is up to the UK and Irish governmentsto assuage fears the of the public first, then people willwillingly to the proper learning environment As FD Roosevelt said “there is nothing to fear, but fear itself”.• Hugh McCarthy is a former principal of Killicomaine Junior High School——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

I must also say I have a degree of sympathy for the police in terms of them trying to enforce legislation that is not particularly clear or consistent.”Councillor Martin Reilly, SDLP group leader, when also asked plainlyhe condemns the police, said: “I’m not going to answer something without first of all having spoken to the party press office.”The News Letter had in fact already spoken to the press office on Thursday a press officer said they would speak to Colum Eastwood, but no response was ever forthcoming.Meanwhile the News Letter can also reveal the Charity Commission is now considering looking into NWMF.The commission’s guidance says trustees must make sure their charity acts in accordance with the law, including health and safety law.The commission said: “I can confirm that the matter has been referred to our enquiries team to consider further.”Charity accounts show the NWMF was funded in  overwhelmingly from two sources – the Big Lotteryand The Executive Office.Together they provided about £, of its roughly £, funds. About £, of that was spent on “Wages and Pension Costs” and “Other Program Costs”.WHO IS LILIAN SEENOI-BARR :Lilian Seenoi-Barr is in her late s and came to Northern Ireland from Kenya as an asylum seeker in December .She founded the North West Migrants Forum in .Asked about the nature of her asylum claim by the News Letter, she refused to discuss it, telling the paper to look where for information about it.In , the IMF stated that “Kenya has acquired a deserved reputation as one of the most stable states in Africa”.It added that whilst there had been some political violence, ethnic clashes, and other disturbances, “the state has managed to keep all of these in check”.A video posted online by the Women on the Move Awards in  features Ms Seenoi-Barr saying she is a member of the Maasai group in Kenya, and that she started what she described as a “rescue” programme for Maasai girls “to empower them and take them to school”.She said: “I managed to rescue over , girls in five years.”She went on: “The elders in the community were not happy at all with my work, and I started receiving a lot of threats and I had to leave.”The SDLP said that “upon arriving in Derry she struggled to integrate due to the lack of services and support”.She went on to stand for election in  for Derry City and Strabane District Council, but failed to win a seat, being narrowly beaten to the last post by independent Sean Carr.After her defeat, two months later in July she was elected to serve as chairwoman of the party’s Derry  Strabane District Executive.

It should be treated as such by all in government.“As the rest of the economy and public services in Northern Ireland begin toto normal, we all want to see our church congregations able to worship together safely once again.”Last weekend, the Irish government indicated that churches in the Republic can re-open for public worship from Monday, June . Church re-opening in the south would probably force the Stormont Executive to make a similar move as the four main denominationsand even churches like the Baptists and Free Presbyterians, operate on an all-Ireland basis with some parishes and congregations in Fermanagh and Tyrone straddling the border.The Church of Ireland, meanwhile, has provided protocol guidance to its parishioners in Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic for dealing with ato churches for services.The church says the guidance is not intended to replace those issued by statutory authorities in both jurisdictions and should always be interpreted in the light of official public health advice. A letter issued by the CoI primate the Rev John McDowell said many of the issues raised may be applicable to other purposes or to other church buildings. “Further advice will follow in relation to the re-opening of churches for activities other than worship or the opening of other parish buildings,” said the primate.\"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-eKZiaR jSxAXl\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-jtRlXQ cUfQBC\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-eKZiaR jSxAXl\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-jtRlXQ cUfQBC\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-dqBHgY sc-gxMtzJ bAegnq\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy News you can trust since Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

in one of his articles that such a progressive town as Penarth was without an operatic and dramatic society, writes Penarth Operatic  Dramatic Societypresident, Mary Gardner.The response to his outcry was quickly taken up and within three weeks the Penarth Operatic Society was formed.The Societyrsquos first production was Gilbert  Sullivanrsquos Iolanthe, played at The Hippodrome which later burnt down, and what a glittering opening evening it must have been as the audience wore evening dress.The review featured next day read, ldquoBrilliant Initial Performance.More newsVale council issues warning over the use of parksFines increased for coronavirus lockdown breachesMarie Curie Great Blooming Tea Party goes virtualA few years later in , the drama section came into being and with it a new title of the Penarth Operatic  Dramatic Society, known affectionately as PODS.Since then PODS has progressed down through the decades with many highlights along the way.One being in  when PODS presented that great musical, The King And I, which won the premier prize at the Waterford International Festival, for which the company received a beautul Waterford crystal vase.The Town Council held a reception to honour the Society at the Paget Rooms, and James Callaghan, the local MP, paid his tribute to PODS saying it ldquoadded lustre and brought culture to Penarth.Another landmark was the play, Dear Octopus, by Dodie Smith produced for PODS th anniversary celebrations.One of our most challenging and exciting shows was Cabaret in , which won the National Operatic  Dramatic Associationrsquos award for Best Production and Best Stage Management and Technical presentation.More recently in , to honour and pay tribute to the many men who gave their lives in World War One, PODS presented the very special play, Last Man Standing, which also won a NODA award for Best Drama.In , PODS decided to do pantomime, and this has been a greatly gratying and popular addition to the companyrsquos output.Itrsquos wonderful to see children in the cast having on-stage experience, and then those children in the audience, perhaps for the first time, enjoying and loving live theatre.PODS is a very busy Society putting on four shows a year, a musical, two plays and a pantomime.Mrs Gardner said: ldquoThis year, sadly and very upsettingly after much hard work by all involved, the covid- virus struck as PODS had just set-up at the Paget Rooms ready for its run of Goodnight Mister Tom, only to be told the venue would be shut down next day.ldquoSince January, the Society had also been rehearsing for its May musical, The Full Monty, and that too has had to be cancelled.       ,params: .pushldquoNevertheless, when this terrible emergency is over the company will put on these two productions sometime in the future. ldquoPODS is proud of its achievement in giving much pleasure and entertainment to the local community with its first-class shows over the last  years, and its goal is to make its centenary in  with the help of its faithful audiences, friends and patrons.PODS is always ready to welcome new members, but at the moment it cannot meet or rehearse due to the covid- restrictions.It might be some time before restrictions are lted on groups being able to rehearse together, or audiences allowed back in theatres, meanwhile PODS members keep in touch on social media.There is a lsquoPODS public grouprsquo on Facebook, PODS quiz nights are being held on Zoom, and there is a website to keep track at podspenarth.org article_url   content_id   site_id

station marks  years despite current coronavirus lockdownThe campaign by the Save Dinas Powys Woods and Protect Homes from Flooding group was launched in March  after the Woodland Trust said NRW was proposing to build a dam within its site of Cwm George and Casehill Woods.The group said the proposals would involve cutting down  square metres of trees including  square metres of ancient trees and regular flooding upstream during high rainfall would result in further destruction of ancient trees, hedgerows, wildle, and plants.Dormice and other protected species like bats were at risk, the group said.The woods, much-loved by the community, attracts visitors from other areas and is the Woodland Trustrsquos most visited site in Wales with more than , visitors.Hundreds of people took part in marches in  to oppose the dam.NRW released its draft Outline Business Case in February  and a consultation period with the local community took place.Hundreds of people attended a meeting in February to oppose the dam and they wrote to NRW, with their views, during the coronavirus lockdown.Chairman of Save Dinas Powys Woods  Protect Homes From Flooding, Peter Smith said the group welcomed the announcement that NRW will not develop a dam in the Dinas Powys Woods.ldquoLocal people recognise the flood risk in the village, but are overwhelmingly in favour of a natural flood management programmein the Cadoxton River and Eastbrook catchments, plus improved channel maintenance andrequired local hard defences, rather than an environmentally unfriendly dam, Dr Smith said.ldquoOur proposals will slow the flow of the rivers upstream thus reducing the risk of flash flooding, and by removing obstacles improve flow downstream.ldquoWe now look forward to working with NRW and The Woodland Trust to design an effective NFM scheme.ldquoBoth have expertise in this area, and, having made funds available for NFM projects, we know that the Welsh Government is keen for Wales to become an exemplar of good practice. community involvement and support will remain key features of our campaign.He added: ldquoWe are grateful to people far and wide who have supported our campaign, including the Woodland Trust, our local community councils, and county councillors.ldquoWe extend our particular thanks our local MS, Jane Hutt, for her advocacy and support.Community councillor, Chris Franks said NRW must not now ignore any problems.ldquoClearly over the years there has been reduced spending on maintenance of the stream through Dinas Powys and towards Barry, he said.ldquoThe public has said that the NRW must improve monitoring of flows on the Cadoxton River, implement natural flood management measures and improve flow at Cardf Road bridge where the stream passes under the A to reduce flood risk.Vale MS Jane Hutt said: ldquolsquoFollowing our meeting on May  Sir David Henshaw chairman of NRW wrote to me on May  to say that NRW received almost  responses to our

has spoken of the plight of rural communities during lockdown in Uganda.Three months ago, Jenipher Wetaka Sambazi, a Fairtrade coffee farmer from the Mt Elgon region in Uganda, was sharing her experiences of the benefit of Fairtrade in Penarthrsquos Tabernacle Baptist Church.More NewsVictory in campaign to save Dinas Powys ancient woodland as dam plan is abandonedVale nurse developed coronavirus symptoms after sitting with patient, inquest toldPenarth RNLI station marks  years despite current coronavirus lockdownNow she and her family, like communities around the world, are under lockdown.In March, campaigners, businesses, supporters, and students from around Wales heard Jenipherrsquos story, face to face.Now she is unable to travel or even meet with her neighbours.This means the coffee picked at the end of the last harvest remains on the mountain and Jenipher and her fellow farmers are prohibited from travelling to gather it for processing under the current lockdown rules.There are currently several hundred known cases of covid- in Uganda, but none in the Mount Elgon region and no fatalities in Uganda as yet.Farmers want to keep it this way, but lockdown is causing other concerns such as limiting access to food and healthcare.This is the time of year when there is the least amount of food available, and the closing of markets and freedom to travel for farmers to source food and water means that times are exceptionally hard.Jenipher as vice-chairwoman of a Fairtrade coffee cooperative, is responsible for many who rely on the cooperative for work.The expert hand-sorters who are seasonal workers and rely on this part of the coffee chain to feed their family at this time, have no coffee to sort.While they may have some spare eggs, vegetables or matoke to trade, the threat of soldiers prohibiting them from doing so is too much for them.Farmer co-operatives, an essential element of Fairtrade, enable and encourage communities to work together.Fairtrade also requires an extra amount of money, the Fairtrade premium, to be paid to producers.Fairtrade farmers like Jenipher are struggling, but they have the benefits of a strong local community as well as the backup of the Fairtrade premium.Fairtrade International have announced a .m euro Fairtrade Producer Relief fund targeting the immediate needs and Resilience Fund to help producers rebuild their businesses after Covid-.Jenipher Wettaka Sambazi said: ldquoLe is hard.ldquoThe markets are shut so there is nowhere to sell or earn money, or to buy food and basic essentials.ldquoLocal health centres have been shut to reduce the chance of spreading the virus, but since all transport is banned, those who need operations, treatment or antenatal care need to walk  km to the nearest hospital.ldquoTwo women and their unborn babies have died on the way.\"Roger Casey, who attends Tabernacle Baptist Church said: ldquoIt was wonderful to meet Jenipher and hear her story.ldquoWe get through a lot of coffee in our office and meeting a real coffee farmer from Uganda makes you think about the real people and real lives behind that Fairtrade logo.Vale MS Jane Hutt said: ldquoMeeting Jenipher during her visit to Wales earlier this year was inspiring.ldquoThe increasing dficulties facing rural farming communities because of the pandemic has shown how important Fairtrade cooperatives continue to be and I am glad that leaders like Jenipher continue to promote the benefits of Fairtrade and to support communities.National co-ordinator of Fair Trade Wales, Aileen Burmeister added: ldquoFair Trade producers are being impacted by covid- restrictions.ldquoGlobal stock markets are falling, meaning that farmers and workers are receiving far less for their produce.\"It is in these times that we can really see how important the Fairtrade minimum price is. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey

A wide range of services were stood down or scaled back due to the risk of spread of COVID-. New services were introduced to meet the predicted demands of the pandemic. A spokesperson said: With the first peak of the COVID- outbreak in Northern Ireland having passed, the Trust is now focused on planning, with our HSC partners, how to restart services while maintaining sufficient flexibility so that services can respond to future waves of this disease. In working together with our health and social care partners across NI to implement the recovery of non-COVID- HSC Services, the agreed regional approach will be to ensure equity of access to treatment for patients and clients across NI, to minimise transmission of COVID- and to protect the most urgent services. A set of guiding principles in the form of a ‘checklist’ has been established by the Department of Healthto guide service planning. The DoH has asked that service restart plans be assessed against the checklist to ensure that they have been subject to a rigorous risk assessment, take account of new ways of working and can be safely implemented in line with social distancing, use of personal protective equipmentand infection prevention and control requirements.The Western Trust has introduced a Reset Framework to support staff in assessing the impact of scaling up or restarting services and to ensure there is a rigorous and careful approach to planning.A spokesperson continued: The Western Trust Stage  Plan identies the services we have maintained throughout these initial months of the COVID- pandemic across a wide range of areas. It identies those that we will continue and others that we will begin to restart or scale up. It sets out some of the important preparation work needed to provide COVID- safe environments and working practices, to protect our staff, patients and service users. There are a number of constraints which are foremost in the planning process, including availability of PPE availability of drugs and restrictions on the practice of vulnerable staff.Our Stage  plan will focus on:Supporting strong community services for frail or older people. Preparing for the impact of the COVID- pandemic on mental health services. Managing risk, and providing COVID--safe services for staff and our service users. Involving our staff and service users.Speaking about the launch of Stage  of the Trust’s Reset Plan, Dr Anne Kilgallen, Western Trust chief executive, said: “There is no doubt that this has been one of the most dficult periods we have ever had to experience.I would like to thank our community and hospital staff for their hard work and dedication. Members of the public have also been unwavering in their support and this has not gone unnoticed. “There are many challenges which we have faced and will continue to face in the new COVID- environment. Our Stage  plan sets out the steps we are taking to rebuild, reset and make necessary changes to our services into the future.“It is accepted that COVID- remains a public health risk to our population and a phased and flexible approach is needed to restarting services. As a result, the way services are delivered may look and feel dferent. There are opportunities to do things dferently in ways that improve care. Many great initiatives have already begun.” Dr Kilgallen continued: “While there are signicant challenges ahead, the public should be reassured that we are committed to providing the best possible care in environments that reduce the risk of infection for staff and services users alike. We will continue to work diligently to create COVID--safe environments while we rebuild services.” A copy of the rebuilding plan – Stage One can you be found on the Trust website www.westerntrust.hscni.net  addthis, Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_bfdecdfdfafbeae   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_ffdeadbcffdefea   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]  []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
